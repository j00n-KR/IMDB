0,TheLittleSongbird,Riveted and stunned into silence,9,4 February 2017,"One of Martin Scorsese's very best films? Not quite, speaking as a fan of 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver'. One of Scorsese's best films in recent years? From personal opinion, yes it is but due to its challenging nature 'Silence' is not going to appeal to all taste-buds.At over two and a half, nearly three, hours, 'Silence' is a little overlong and the slow pace may be a challenge for some. Long lengths are not a problem usually in films, especially when a film is continually riveting enough to justify it, neither is slow pacing when more often than not there is a reason for being so.It was clear that the pacing was deliberate and it wasn't an issue at all, because of how well made 'Silence' is and what it does with its themes. Personally do think however that a few of the early parts of the film could have been trimmed down or tightened up, because there are a few draggy aimless stretches that are also rather on the repetitive side, the points 'Silence' makes are made very clearly but in these few spots it was like it didn't quite know how or when to stop.On the other hand, 'Silence' is visually stunning. There are no words to describe how magnificent the cinematography is and am so happy that it's warranted an Oscar nomination, and the bleak and unforgiving landscapes are very evocative of the subject matter and cruel mood. Scorsese's direction is exemplary, hard-hitting but also at times remarkably subdued. The music similarly is a nice fit and doesn't feel heavy-handed.The script was clearly written with a lot of thought and intent and evokes very strong emotions, if a little repetitious in places. The story is simply riveting, rendering images that are hard-hitting with full impact and with complex themes that are expansively explored with raw power but also in a restrained way. The ending is devastating and Liam Neeson's scenes, integral to the film, sees the story at its most focused.All the acting is exceptional, helped by strong writing and sharply drawn characters. Andrew Garfield is subdued but still splendid, while Adam Driver is powerfully moody. Liam Neeson is on fearless form and gives perhaps his best performance since 'Kinsey'. Issei Ogata is superbly shady, and Yōsuke Kubozuka honestly couldn't have brought any more delicious juice to Kichijiro even if attempted.In summary, riveting film, one to experience and live with without ever forgetting, with a slightly shorter length and a little trimming it would have been a masterwork. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Silence
1,Leofwine_draca,Very boring,4,20 September 2018,"SILENCE is the second overlong and self-indulgent film I've seen from director Martin Scorsese, following on from the very poor show which was HUGO. This film seems to have been made as a propaganda piece for the Catholic church, exploring the historical plight of Jesuit missionaries in Japan in the 17th century. As a film, it's surprisingly simplistic in tone, with the Japanese depicted as either good (those who've ""seen the light"", of course) or diabolically evil (committing all manner of torture and murder in gruelling and shocking scenes reminiscent of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST). As a whole, the film is overlong and very boring indeed, characters given to endless introspection. Garfield tries hard but others like Driver and Neeson seem to be cast adrift. This is a very well shot film, the only decent thing about it. Otherwise, SILENCE is a film that seems to exist solely because of the director's Italian-American background.",Silence
2,SnoopyStyle,harrowing first half,7,10 November 2017,"In 17th century Japan, Christians are persecuted. Jesuit priests from Portugal and their Japanese peasant converts are being massacred. Word arrives that senior priest Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had renounced his faith. His proteges Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are in disbelief. They travel to Japan guided by refugee Kichijiro who claims to be Christian. They find small communities of fearful Christians trying to hide their faith from ruthless inquisitor governor Inoue Masashige and cunning interpreter Mokichi.Martin Scorsese doesn't know how to film a bad looking scene. The first half is harrowing and on its way to being one of the best films of the year. The midway point has Rodrigues and Garupe disagreeing about trampling a religious icon. That argument needs to be aired out and expanded. Scorsese should have let them stake out their positions. It would clarify Rodrigues' starting point and allow his journey to be more compelling. It's just odd that he seems to appreciate the deadly danger at that point but naively shocked at the actual violence done to the people after that. I expected him to be smarter or at least, not be the doe-eyed innocent shocked at everything. His emotional journey should be less melodramatic so that Ferreira's reveal could be much more shocking. With a minor alteration, the journey would have worked much better.",Silence
3,Hitchcoc,Heart of Darkness,8,21 May 2017,"I feel inadequate to make a really intelligent analysis of this film. Not being able to embrace the essence of seventeenth century Catholicism and the mission in Japan, I will only comment on the sense this film gave me. I understand that the two men at the center of ""Silence"" are incredibly pious, wishing to save the soul of their mentor. But they are also pretty naive in their approach. Somehow, they feel they can take on centuries of hatred for their religion, armed only with their faith. They also have no idea how torture and the fear of death could lead to apostasy. Liam Nisson's character succumbs to it and so the object of their purpose has had time to settle into his newfound comfort. He could be seen as a coward; or one could see him as a fact of life. Speaking of life, while Martin Scorsese is one of my top five directors all time, this really plods along as repetitious and lacking in any kind of unresolved conflict. Mercifully, we are finally led to face to face we have been waiting for. I felt relief rather than excitement as this was finally here. I suppose one who is a little short on religious fervor might say that when you invade someone else's territory, you run the risk of playing by their rules eventually. This is a striking film, but, for me, not one I will remember long. There are graphic scenes of torture and violence, but they are sort of detached from our immediate experience.",Silence
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Very powerful movie, with incredible depth and relevance, even centuries after it plays",8,8 March 2017,"""Silence"" is the newest movie by Italian-American filmmaker Martin Scorsese. He is the director here and also one of the writers. Of course, this is an adaptation as this work originates from writer Shûsaku Endô and this is far from the first time Scorsese digs into Asian territory here if you remember ""The Departed"" or ""Kundun"", a film not too many remember, let alone in relation with Scorsese. But lets take a look at this one here. It is really long, way closer to the three-hour mark than the two-hour mark. And despite this massive runtime, the movie almost never drags. Yes the first 100 minutes, maybe 2 hours even, may be really slow and there is not that much happening that really stays in the mind for the wow effect, but it is still an extremely convincing character study about Andrew Garfield's character. Now I mentioned Garfield already. He is the only lead actor and star here and it is an amazing year for him with starring in Scorsese/Gibson films and scoring his first Oscar nomination as well. I remember really liking him early in his career, but this liking has faded a bit since then, but now today I know again what I saw in him and there is no denying he is one of the top lead actors in Hollywood right now with this movie here and ""Hacksaw Ridge"".There's also a couple really convincing supporting performances in here. Issei Ogata definitely would have deserved an Oscar nomination as well as he may be the most memorable movie villain of 2016. Adam Driver does what he can do and elevates a character that really has little memorable value to himself, but Driver makes him interesting as well. Liam Neeson was okay too and he makes the ending the best part of the film, but I don't really see the praise by those considering him for an Academy Award nomination. However, his ""Our Lord"" is probably the most significant quote from the entire film and I guess this is the reason why so many remember him here, apart from the fact that he has a lot of screen time in the last third of the movie. But what is the real strength of this film. I think one reason is Andrew Garfield and I'd have loved to see him win an Oscar for his work here. I am also fairly certain that people 20 years from now will consider this one of the best, if not the best 2016 film. It delivers so so much. It is historically relevant. It makes a strong statement about religion while never being condescending into one direction or the other. It just picks times the way they were. There were many Japanese back then who would never agree to killing Christians, the ones we see in here, the ones who do it are a tiny minority only. And in addition, the film is also pretty beautiful to watch, the cinematography nomination is more than deserving. It's unreal this is all they gave to this movie. I guess the likes of ""Passengers"" was more deserving right?Finally, I am not shy to call this our generation's ""Apocalypse Now"" and there are also many moments that reminded me of ""The Deer Hunter"". It is also quite fitting that you never think of these films when you hear the names De Niro and Sheen, and when you hear the name Garfield, you probably won't think of ""Silence"" either. But you absolutely should. This was a stunning movie and I am sure there is not another film from 2016 that comes near it in terms of depth. I'd have been perfectly fine with this one winning Best Picture, even if I would not call it my no°1 favorite of the year. This, however, only has to do with the fact that religion or 17th century Asia were never really subjects I cared for a lot, so if you have a deeper interest in these fields, then this is an absolute must-see and it probably would have been my favorite of the year too if I had such interest. But still it is really impressive how it is probably my number 2 of 2016 right now and it's a perfect example of how great Scorsese still is, how he can even make such a specific and perhaps unappealing to many (especially action film fans) subject so great to watch. So tense and atmospheric and really significant. I highly highly recommend you to not miss out on this mesmerizing watch. I have no doubt this film will age greatly and be considered among Scorsese's best at some point, and that means quite something looking at his body of work. Close to being a masterpiece. The man's still got it, but actually everybody else (even the tiniest little camera assistant) deserves a thumbs-up for what they did here.",Silence
5,Prismark10,To apostate,6,21 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese has made a personal epic which he has wanted to make for years. Silence is an adaptation of Shusaku Endo's 1966 historical novel. The trouble is the older Scorsese is not in the peak of his filmmaking skills and this film is uneven even muddled.Despite some nice photography of Taiwan standing in for feudal Japan, I hesitate to even call it a visual epic, the script is laborious which no amount of praise for the film by Pope Francis can make you overlook it.Jesuits priests brought Christianity to parts of Japan in the mid 16th century but it soon became unwelcome. It seems the Japanese became wary of the ulterior motives of some of these missionaries. In the 1630s, Christianity was banned and those who practised the religion were persecuted.Silence follows two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver) who make a treacherous journey to Japan to find out what happened to their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is believed to have renounced his faith. The two priests regard the claims as a slander and want to find out for themselves.When they arrive they discover enclaves of hidden Christians practising their faith in secret and then witness the torture and persecution of the peasants when they are caught that includes being beheaded, drowned, burnt alive and crucified. It is only now they realise the true plight and dangers that Christians in Japan face.Rodrigues is caught and his inquisitor wants to make an example of him like they did with his mentor. He is taunted to publicly renounce his faith in order to save the lives of others or let them die horrifically and enter martyrdom. Rodrigues gets visions of Jesus and wonders about the virtues of being flexible in his beliefs.The question the film repeatedly asks is whether Christianity can flourish in a swamp. Well Christianity did spread in south and central America, but there the Jesuits and others forcibly converted people and killed or enslaved those who refused. The casting of Liam Neeson just invites people to recall the more superior film, The Mission.",Silence
6,claudio_carvalho,"Good, but Too Long and Tiresome Film",7,12 March 2017,"In the Seventeenth Century, in Portugal, the Portuguese Jesuit priests Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe[ (Adam Driver) ask permission to Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) to travel to Japan to investigate the rumors that their mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had committed apostasy abandoning his Catholic faith after being tortured by the shogunate. They meet the alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) that agrees to guide them to Japan. When they arrive at a small village, they learn that the Christians residents live hidden in caves since the Inquisitor kills any villager suspect to be Christian. Along the days, Rodrigues and Garupel propagate Catholicism among the villagers and try to find a lead to Ferreira. But when the Inquisitor arrives in the village with his men, the live of the residents and the priests will change.""Silence"" is a film directed by Martin Scorcese that shows how cruel a man can be. Based on historical facts, ""Silence"" show the powerful Shogunate defending their religion and culture against the European Catholicism that promises easy paradise to the suffered Japanese workers that has to work lot to pay the taxes and survive. The result is a good, but too long and tiresome film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Silêncio"" (""Silence"")",Silence
7,nogodnomasters,Where is there a place for a weak man,6,6 August 2017,"The film is based on a historical novel. It starts in 1633 when Buddhists began their Inquisition of Catholics, doing to Catholics what Catholics had done to non-Christians in Europe. Word gets to Europe that Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) had given up the faith. Two of his students travel to Japan to find out if this is true. They discover an underground community of Christians in Nagasaki which they minister to. They hear confessions and perform Masses in Latin, something the community couldn't do themselves. Once discovered, it comes down to the priest having to deny his faith in order to save the lives of others.The movie is filled with monologue whispers. At 65 minutes into the film, we hear the title mentioned in ""the silence of God"" a statement of questioning faith. The film was long and boring, watching people step on a silver plaque bearing the likeness of Jesus or not. Liam Neeson had a small role, but effectively explains the issue with Christian missionaries, both in Japan and elsewhere.The film is dedicated to Japanese Christians and estimated minority of 1%-2.3 %. I saw the dedication as tongue-in-cheek.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity",Silence
8,kosmasp,Religious much?,6,22 July 2017,"The premise is that Christians had it really tough in Japan. They were hunted, they were punished unless they became faithless. In a way this is what Rome did way back in the day, when they were trying to suppress Christianity. Of course we cannot forget that Christianity also tried to force themselves and their believe on others, while invading countries for quite some time.So everything relating to punish people because of religion, I'd say not really a good thing. Whether it be of what you believe (or don't) or what you want others to believe. This journey is really a tough one though and as others already have stated here, this is not an entertaining movie. It also brings home the message way before the movie ends. In other words, it may have done with a shorter running time.Having written all that, I can also say as many have before me, that this is technically brilliant. The actors also doing a great job, Scorsese going back to one of his favorite themes. While Bringing out the Dead was not successful and had its issues too, this sees an expected evolution to the theme. Tough and long watch then, are you up for it? Will this be something you want to see?",Silence
9,classicsoncall,"""The hard thing to die for is the miserable and corrupt.""",8,5 November 2019,"In many respects, this movie plays like a horror film with regard to the incredible tortures the old Samurai Inoue (Issei Ogata) concocted to turn adherents of Christianity into apostates. Not enough to physically beat on people, the horrors involved setting on fire and crucifixion during high tide to drown one's victims. It became totally credible why Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) renounced his faith by virtue of the many lives he saved who would have faced retribution as part of Ferreira's own punishment. Which is why the dialog between Ferreira and Father Rodrigues Sebastiao (Andrew Garfield) is so conflicted on both sides, the latter unable to grasp the centuries of virulent opposition to Christianity by Japanese daimyos. Just as casual viewers might not fully understand the history of Catholic martyrs who suffered and died for their faith during totally different eras and under different circumstances. The film brought to attention something I've always wondered about, that being what the mind holds firmly in belief versus actions taken to avoid pain and suffering. All three principles in the story, portrayed by Garfield, Adam Driver and Neeeson, give exceptional performances, though Neeson's Ferreira is absent for a good part of the story. Many parts of the movie are difficult to watch, much less attempt to comprehend, as man's inhumanity to man for no other reason than opposing religious viewpoints is often on display.",Silence
10,lee_eisenberg,Scorsese's unusual turn,9,15 June 2017,"Martin Scorsese is best known as the man behind ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". Lesser known are his movies that focus on religion. His first one was ""The Last Temptation of Christ"". Next was ""Kundun"" (about the early years of the Dalai Lama). Now he brings us ""Silence"", a work of historical fiction about some young priests investigating reports that their teacher apostatized after getting tortured in Japan in the 17th century. In addition to investigating this, the priests also seek to give moral support to Japan's Christians, who are getting persecuted by the government.I had a couple of thoughts while watching the movie. I wondered what the Japanese thought of it. After all, the Japanese may have seen Christianity as an instrument of destroying their culture (which it was in the places that the European colonial powers invaded). Also, watching the torture that the Japanese inflicted on the Jesuits, I wondered why the Jesuits didn't just go ahead and renounce their faith. If someone did that to me, I'd say uncle in a second. True, Catholicism was the main part of the Jesuits' lifestyle, but how could anyone tolerate that torture? In the end, I wouldn't call it Scorsese's greatest movie, but it's worth seeing. While Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver get top billing, I thought that Liam Neeson's character - based on real-life priest Cristóvão Ferreira - was the most interesting character. I'm eager to see what Marty's next movie will be.I wonder how long it took to sail from Portugal to Japan.",Silence
11,jboothmillard,Silence,5,25 June 2017,"I saw a brief trailer and TV spots for this film, I knew it was something to do with religion, I assumed the title is something to do with a ritual or whatever,mike monks, but I was interested to see what it would have, directed by Martin Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street). Basically set in the 17th century, in Portugal, two Portuguese Catholic Fathers, Father Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), ask permission from Father Alessandro Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) to travel to Japan. They are travelling to the village of Tomogi, Japan, after hearing rumours that their mentor, Father Cristovao Ferreira (Liam Neeson), has committed apostasy, abandoning his Catholic faith, they are investigating the truth and trying to locate him. Rodrigues and Garupe are guided by alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka), who fled Japan to save himself, they arrive amidst the bloodshed of the anti-Christian purges, witnessing the unbearable burden of a different belief in a land founded on tradition. The two-man army follow the various traces of Ferreira's sightings, there is a point when Garupe leaves for Hirado Island, while Rodrigues goes to Gotō Island, the last place Ferreira lived, but it is destroyed, he is then betrayed by Kichijiro and captured by the Japanese Grand Inquisitor Inoue. Rodrigues is taken to Nagasaki, imprisoned with many Japanese converts, there he watches many horrific tortures performed on the Japanese Christians, including three men taken offshore, crucified, staying on the crosses until the sea water rises and drowns them. After some time, Garupe is also captured, Rodrigues is restrained by guards as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatise, he too is drowned trying to rescue the last of the three prisoners. Then Rodrigues is taken to meet an older Ferreira, who has become part of the community, he says he committed apostasy while being tortured, and after fifteen years he now believes Christianity is a lost cause in Japan, Rodrigues calls him a disgrace. Years later, Ferreira has died, Kichijiro asks Rodrigues to absolve him of his apostasy, but Rodrigues refuses, saying he is no longer a priest, Kichijiro is later caught for stealing, taken and never from again, many years later Rodrigues, still a prisoner, dies and is cremated. Also starring Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi and Tadanobu Asano as Interpreter. Garfield really is committed to his role, forced to choose between giving up his beliefs or facing prolonged torture and agonising death, Driver is fine in his time on screen, and Neeson as usual is fearless. I will admit I did not understand absolutely everything going on, there were occasional subtitles and many slow, long takes with little dialogue, and it is almost three hours long, but I understood the premise, with strong themes about not just religion, but passion of faith and the human condition, it does have some memorable stuff in it, so overall not a bad historical drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Worth watching!",Silence

13,Quinoa1984,"Scorsese in Bergman/Dreyer mode, and it's amazing",10,8 January 2017,"It's Scorsese. Martin Scorsese. He makes the best films. Is this one of his best? Hmm....It's a personal/religious epic, but it's all about the interior self - an intimate epic, which is always the toughest to pull off. Silence chronicles morality in such a way that is staggering and with very few specks of light (that is, brief relief through laughter - it does come through the character Kichijiro, more on him in a moment), and it's practically an anomaly to be released by a major studio with such a budget and big stars. This is a story that comes from history you rarely ever get to see anymore - history from a country like Japan that doesn't involve samurai (at least how we see them) and dealing with Christianity vs Buddhism - and it's directed with a level of vision, I mean in the true, eye-and-heart opening sense that declares that this man still has a lot to say, maybe more than ever, in his latter years.Silence is, now pondering it hours after seeing it, possibly the best ""faith-based"" film ever made (or at least since Last Temptation of Christ); in its unintentional way, a great antidote to those pieces of garbage like God's Not Dead and War Room which preach only to a select few and insult the intelligence of everyone else. In this story of Jesuit priests who go on a journey to find a priest who may be long gone but could be found and brought home, it's meant for adults who can and should make up their own minds on religion and God, and the persecution part of it isn't some ploy from the filmmakers for fraudulent attention. This is about exploring what it means if you have faith, or how to question others who do, and what happens when people clash based on how people see the sun. Literally, I'm serious.It's also heavier than most other films by this director, which is good but also tough to take on a first viewing. And yet it feels always like a Scorsese film, not only due to the rigorous craft on display (I could feel the storyboards simmering off on to the screen, I mean that as a compliment, this is staggeringly shot by Rodrigo Prieto, I'm glad Scorsese's found another guy), or the performances from the main actors (Garfield is easily giving his all, and not in any cheesy way, Driver's solid, Neeson seems to be paying some sort of penance for some mediocre action fare), but because of a key character: Kichijiro.He's someone who really fits in to the Scorsese canon of characters who are so tough to take - he makes things difficult for Rodrigues, to say the least, and yet keeps coming back like some sad pathetic dog who can't make up his mind - but, ultimately, the toughest thing of all for this Father, as it must be for this filmmaker, is 'I know he is weak and irrational and probably bad in some way... but he must be loved as all of other God's children.' So as far as unsung performances for 2016 go, Yôsuke Kubozuka follows in a tradition set out by none other than De Niro (think of him in Mean Streets and Raging Bull, it's like that only not quite so angry).I may need another viewing to fully grasp it. But for now, yes, see it, of course. For all its length and vigorous explorations and depictions of suffering (occasionally highly graphic), not to mention the, for Scorsese, highly unusual approach of a lack of traditional (or any) music or score, it's unlike anything you'll see in cinema this year, maybe the decade, for pairing the struggle of a man to reconcile his God and his responsibility to others in a repressive regime with the visual splendor of something from another time - maybe Kurosawa if he'd had a collaboration with Bergman. And yet for all of this high praise, there's also a feeling of being exhausted by the end of it. Whether that exhaustion extends to other viewings I'm not sure yet. As a life-long ""fan"" of this director, I was impressed if not blown away.",Silence
14,sunwarrior13,Scorsese's Exploration Of Faith And Spirituality Fell Short,6,15 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese does another film in the tradition of his former films like ""The Last Temptation Of Christ"" which explores religious themes such as faith in the face of oppression,spirituality and the conflict of divine nature and human nature in this film entitled ""Silence"".It was based on the 1966 novel written by Shūsaku Endō of the same title as well as the 1971 Japanese film adaptation of the said novel entitled ""Chinmoku"" (English translation:Silence).It stars Andrew Garfield,Adam Driver,Tadanobu Asano,Ciarán Hinds and Liam Neeson. Director Martin Scorsese and Jay Cocks wrote the screenplay together.The story starts when Portuguese Jesuit priest Fr.Alessandro Valignano receives the news that Father Cristóvão Ferreira,who went to Japan has already renounced his Roman Catholic faith.Despite knowing the on- going Christian oppression and the danger they are facing,Fathers Francisco Garupe and Sebastião Rodrigues decided to embark a journey in the country with the help of an alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro. All of them land in a village that consist of many Japanese Christians.As the story progresses, we get to see both Rodrigues and Garupe witness the on-going violence that has been happening in the country due to Christian oppression.In the end,we get to see themselves also get arrested by the Japanese soldiers with aid of Kichijiro. We also get to see the meeting between Father Rodrigues and Ferreira,who apparently has already apostatized being a Catholic and has become already a Buddhist and have immersed into becoming a Buddhist and into the Japanese culture as well.We get to see their exchange of words with Ferreira trying to convince Rodrigues to renounce his faith for the sake of living a longer life as well and to end the suffering,torture and oppression that he is undergoing as well as those that he is witnessing which included the death of many Christian Japanese villagers as well as that of Garupe,who was stabbed in the middle of the ocean.When Rodrigues could no longer bear his suffering emotionally, psychologically and physically,he decided to apostatize in the end and renounce his Catholic faith just like Ferreira as well. But when he passed away and he given a Buddhist burial, interestingly Rodrigues held a small cross in his hand.After watching this film two days before this review was being written,it led me to the original 1971 Japanese film ""Chimoku"".Personally,I felt that this was basically more of a remake of ""Chimoku"" rather than having an American version of the Endō's novel. The interesting exchange of words between Ferreira and Rodrigues from apostasy, God's divine nature particularly being silent especially when man needs His response the most after prayer, and the renunciation of faith could only be a formality to live longer were all explored.Too bad that I just felt the lack of intensity in it and the exploration of these themes was somewhat lacking. Don't get me wrong. Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson as Rodrigues and Ferreira respectively could have given a better performance for they are both talented actors. I just felt the screenplay fell short.I blame both screenwriters -Jay Cocks and director Martin Scorsese - for it. Rodrigues just gave up his faith and I felt that he never experienced so much pain physically,psychologically and emotionally from it when he lived as a Japanese pagan and got immersed into their country's culture. Also,the suffering that he had to go through felt lacking as well as the desire want to live longer.I felt that wanting less Christian Japanese villagers killed wasn't enough considering he was a priest - who loves Christ the most.Besides,aren't the Christian Japanese villagers willing to die for Christ? They didn't even stepped on and spat on the Christian carvings and were undergoing a lot of sufferings for very a long time and yet never abandoned their faith. What's even worse is that the issue of martyrdom among the Japanese villagers wasn't fully explored as well. The film showed that these Christian converts died due to lack of education.Nothing more.Even the complexity of the character of Kichijiro was left at that reason as well together with the on-going Christian persecution that was occurring in Japan during the 17th century. That is why it somehow felt short due to lack of full exploration of the themes about faith and spirituality.It also never took into consideration their pride as a Japanese people and why their love for Jesus is greater unlike the Japanese soldiers,whose love for country resisted Western influence that all pointed to Christianity was definitely mentioned.If you want to see a better film,check out the Japanese film ""Chinmoku"" for is a lot better than Scorsese's version.",Silence

16,Theo Robertson,God Is Dead . Let Us Pray That Scorsese's Talent Isn't,5,27 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese ? I do remember being asked about religion in a University film class and replying that as far as I'm concerned Martin Scorsese is God . He is in my humble opinion the greatest living film maker in the world today and has been for several decades . It is noticeable that since the turn of the century he has tried a little bit too hard to wow the Oscar academy and considering the big name award ceremonies have effectively ignored SILENCE I did wonder if Scorsese might have shot himself in the foot by making an all too obvious Oscar bait type movie ? The simple , bitter truth is that SILENCE hasn't been snubbed due to Oscar politics but simply because it's not a good film at all . First up it's rather plodding and disjointed movie featuring two protagonists travelling from 16th Century Europe to Japan to find a former mentor and spread the Catholic faith . At no point in the movie was I aware of any time frame . The two priests find themselves established in Japan with Catholic converts but all this seems unnatural from a credibility point of view . There's narration filling in the gaps but this use of voice over is obvious and clumsy expositionThere's also a problem with the acting . Garfield and Driver make for two uncharismatic leads and they're not good enough to carry this mediocre , disappointing film but the supporting Oriental cast are even worse . I noticed this was another serious problem with Scorsese's KUNDUN where a non English speaking amateur cast struggled and failed to bring life to English dialogue The fundamental problem though is the obvious elephant in the room - religious faith . One wonders if Scorsese is having a test of faith within his own head . The Lord works in mysterious ways . So mysterious in fact that it could be there is no God and our prayers will be met be silence ? It's often impossible to listen to the voice over without thinking Scorsese is having a meta-fictional conversation with himself . Marty if you're reading this every true fan of cinema has total faith in you and we want to see you come out compelling films with existentialism mixed with redemption that even cynical hardcore atheists will enjoy .",Silence

What follows is their (and our) tortuous journey as the authorities persecute and brutally torture both the priests and their flock by some of the most humiliating, creatively vicious and merciless methods ever committed to film. It's a long watch - indeed, it's far too long - and it is at times a difficult watch too; but if even half of it were to ring true then it is a savage indictment of man's inhumanity to man - regardless of the religious undertones. Garfield struggles, to be honest - his performance lacks intensity and Driver is just plain wooden and that's a shame because better talent immersed in this tale of determination and almost obsessive faith would have delivered a far more potent piece of cinema.

Quite gritty in its depiction of the persecution Christians faced, as well as the dilemmas they faced. The moral quandaries of the priests when faced with torture and death, not only of themselves of their flock, are explored well. Some good themes covered, especially faith and what one has to do to remain true to it. Powerful ending.However, far from perfect.

(The immediate context of this Big Blast, of course, was a decade of unprovoked misbehavior on the part of Japan, which raped China, Korea, and the Philippines, as well as Sneak-Attacking Hawaii and Alaska, while committing countless thousands of Barbarous Sadistic Perverted War Crimes in the process of Murdering Millions of innocent bystanders just trying to live their lives.)

Japan has been seeking to abolish Christianity by way of mass executions, but there are still pockets of secret Christians. Father Ferreira, it is rumoured, has denied his faith and turned native Japanese - could this deeply disturbing suggestion be true, or is it just a rumour to serve Japanese political ends?I have never before seen a film with the word ""apostatised"" used once, let alone the number of times it is used in this film. But since apostasy is at the heart of the matter, I suppose that is fair enough.Martin Scorsese sets out to dramatise a true(ish) episode towards the end of the Jesuit priesthood's attempted conversion of Japan, at the point where the Japanese establishment is taking a hard line to stamp it out, and the main method they are using is barbaric physical punishment of the native Christian population as pressure to force the priesthood into publicly denying their faith.This is solid drama material, but Scorsese fails to make a satisfying film of it: large sections are boring and repetitive as the two young priests, admirably played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, beat themselves up endlessly about how horrible it all is (and, to be fair, they are right) and how God isn't listening to them. The Almighty does chip in a few words towards the end, but they are not terribly helpful.The dramatisation could have been better. The Japanese character Kichijiro repeatedly denies his faith then seeks confession and forgiveness, to the extent that Rodrigues quietly loses any sympathy for him. I kept waiting for this to have a dramatic payoff, but it never did.In fact, for a film which ran for nearly 3 hours, the dramatic heart could have been condensed into half the running time: as it was, I felt nearly as punished as the two priests.The barbarity of punishment is shown but, thankfully, not dwelled upon.

24,ferguson-6,a discomforting masterpiece,8,5 January 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Martin Luther King said ""Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase"". Martin Scorcese's esteemed film career could be described as unveiling that staircase, one step/film at a time. Religion, spirituality and yes, faith, have played a key role in his life and his films – most notably, Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ, but also most of his other projects.A high-ranking priest (Ciaran Hinds) is meeting with two younger Portuguese priests and informing them of the rumor that their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has reportedly renounced his faith and is now living as a Japanese Buddhist in Nagasaki. The two young Jesuit priests, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) refuse to believe this and request to be allowed to track down Ferreira and bring him home. It could be termed a rescue mission, and the two men could be called missionaries, but what follows is an excruciating test of their own faith. Martin Scorcese has been working on this passion project for more than two decades – ever since he read the Shusaku Endo novel (published in 1966). Cast members have changed through the various iterations of the project, but after the box office success of The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorcese received the financial backing to bring his vision to the screen. He co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks (Gangs of New York) and the result is the visual and emotional epic that you might expect from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. 17th century Christianity in Japan might be a difficult subject to sell to the general movie-going public, and Scorcese goes out of his way to leave unanswered the multitude of questions the film raises. Rather than wrapping it up with a clean ending, he leaves viewers craving further discussions, clarity and explanations. In other words, it lacks mass appeal and shouldn't be confused with light-hearted entertainment.Rodrigues is resolute in his belief that God is the answer  even when the film's title is at the forefront. As Rodrigues and Garupe minister to the village of secret Christians (led by Yoshi Oida and Shinya Tsukamoto) at night and hide during the day, we learn of the Japanese state's commitment to eradicating Christians and Christianity to ensure the power and isolation of the country. The oddest character in the film is that of Kichijiro (an excellent Yosuke Kubozuka). He is both guide to the priests and a constant challenge to their faith, while also providing moments of comic relief in a film with very few. Were this a Kurosawa film, this role would have been a perfect fit for the great Tishiro Mifune.The most obvious adversary for the priests is the Japanese elder known as The Inquisitor. Issei Ogata excels in the role as a wily, half-smiling, quite knowledgeable wartime (a war on Christianity) leader intent on creating the most painful and public extermination of Christian believers and those priests who dare to infect his country (Japan's 1614 Edict of Expulsion). The torture and persecution is too much to detail here, but it portrays how even the most ardent believers could choose life over faith.The film blends fiction with some true-to-life aspects, and is most effective at asking questions and spurring thought. Which is more crucial – public or private faith? Is doubt allowable and even understandable? Is Rodrigues so committed to faith or is there also an element of martyrdom present? How about the ""Judas"" sub-plots? Is it betrayal if it saves one's own life? Just where is that line? Is Ferreira a disgraced priest or simply a man valuing survival? The film is beautiful to look at (superb work from cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and editor Thelma Schoonmaker) while being exceedingly tough to watch (and quite long). Be prepared to set aside time for reflection and discussion  you may even discover some surprises in your views and beliefs.",Silence
25,Wuchakk,"Great filmmaking, cast and locations, but strangely inert (overlong) story",4,9 April 2017,"Released in late 2016 and directed by Martin Scorsese based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô, ""Silence"" chronicles events in 1640 when two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) journey to Japan to check on the persecuted church and find out what happened to their mentor, whom it is rumored fell from the faith (Liam Neeson). Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.The Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.In tone and theme, ""Silence"" is reminiscent of movies like the excellent ""Black Robe"" (1991), the solid ""The Mission"" (1986) and the surprisingly great ""Black Death"" (see my review). There are also elements of ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate ""Silence,"" but it didn't work for me. Sure, Scorsese is a great auteur and so the filmmaking is top-of-the-line – the cinematography, the cast, the costuming, locations and score. Unfortunately, the story's not compelling and I never connected with the main character, despite Garfield's quality performance.There's some worthy mindfood (or spiritfood) to glean from the proceedings, however, like: Why does God allow the excruciating persecution of His faithful? Why is He silent? IS He silent? Can a believer be restored after cowardly denying the Lord in the face of torture/death? Can a Christian hide their faith while living in a thoroughly hostile culture? But I didn't buy for a second that the Japanese couldn't conceive of a Deity that transcends physical nature, like the sun, sea or mountain. While the idea may have been alien to their communal mindset at the time, it's absurd to think that no individual man or woman could discern the obvious (see Psalm 19:1 & Romans 1:20).Although I'm sorta glad I saw it, ""Silence"" is curiously dull and overlong; and so I never care to see it again. There are far superior movies that tackle similar topics. Those who give it the highest possible rating must be fanatical devotees of Scorsese.The movie runs 161 minutes and was shot in Taiwan and the Cathedral Of Saint Paul In Macau, China.GRADE: C-",Silence

It is a very long film that explores faith and Catholicism in Japan in the 17th century, a time when being a Christian was punished by torture and death. The film has moments but for the most part it moves very slowly between torture scenes and hiding from the Buddhist forces who desire to cleanse Japan of Catholicism.The setting opens in 1633 Japan as Portuguese Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) is writing a letter. Then the film jumps to 1637. Two Portuguese Jesuits, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) listen as Father Valignano (Ciarán Hinds) reads the letter, which is said to be the last known writing from their mentor, Father Ferreira. Valignano says that Ferreira eventually apostatized to avoid being tortured and now lives in Japan in an arranged marriage. The two Portuguese priests do not believe this because Father Ferreira was their mentor and a committed believer of Christianity and a powerful influence on everyone he knew. They were going to be dispatched to find Ferreira, but with this message, the task seems complete. However, Rodrigues and Garupe beg permission to go to Japan to find out the truth about Father Ferreira and clear his name. Valignano reluctantly allows them to go. Rodrigues and Garupe face the ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor at a time when Catholicism was outlawed and their presence forbidden. They are 'assisted by an intermittently faithful Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) and when captured are interrogated by Inoue (Issei Ogata) and after years go by the faith of Rodigues is tested and to say more would spoil the little story there is.The film is heavy handed, dark, well photographed, and has some solid points about Japanese culture versus Western culture, faith, Catholicism, Buddhism – and in many ways points out the pain and futility of entering another country's space and beliefs and the futile attempt to impose our own ways to 'make them better'.

While there, they are faced by severe protest & torture. 'Silence' left me disturbed & thought provoked. Scorsese delivers such a brutal tale of people driven by faith & later being tortured for their beliefs. The Japanese torture & brutalize the Christians as they try to propagate Catholicism. To be honest, you need a very strong stomach to absorb 'Silence', its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. The goings-on are very intense & at times, brutal.Scorsese doesn't shy away from showing what has to be shown. This tale of faith & the violent prosecution that follows, is told with relentlessness. And by the time you reach its final-act, where a shocking twist unfolds though an character, you're bound to be shocked. 'Silence' truly questions humanity & how faith can be questioned too. And above all, it questions God with pain & sorrow. Scorsese's Direction is remarkable. He brings his passion to life with gut-wrenching intensity. Without a shed of doubt, 'Silence' finds him at his peak! Jay Cocks & Scorsese's Screenplay, Based upon the 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō. is frightening, but arresting all through.

Kim Allen Kluge & Kathryn Kluge's Score is perfect.Performance-Wise: Andrew Garfield as Sebastião Rodrigues, the protagonist, takes upon the challenge Scorsese puts him in & in return, delivers a moving performance. His breakdowns when he witnesses brutality on the name of his faith, appear real & haunting. Adam Driver as Francisco Garupe, does well in a relatively smaller role. Liam Neeson as Father Cristóvão Ferreira, enters the scene pretty late, but commands the screen. He's fabulous! Issey Ogata as the inquisitor, the antagonist, is fantastic. He is a scene-stealer!

28,JamesHitchcock,A Dark Masterpiece,10,15 January 2017,"Christianity was first introduced into Japan in the 16th century by European missionaries, who at first enjoyed considerable success in winning converts to their faith. After 1620, however, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued an edict forbidding Christianity, following which the Japanese authorities initiated a ruthless campaign of persecution against the new religion. Foreign missionaries were banned from entering the country, and Japanese converts were forced to renounce their faith upon pain of torture or execution if they refused. The only outsiders allowed to enter Japan were Dutch traders, and they were only tolerated on the strict understanding that they did not attempt to proselytise; Protestantism was no more welcome to the Shogun than was Catholicism.These events formed the subject-matter of the 1966 novel ""Silence"" by the Japanese writer Shūsaku Endō. Ever since the early nineties Martin Scorsese has had the ambition of turning Endō's novel into a film, and this is the result. In the 1640s two Portuguese Jesuits, Sebastião Rodrigues and Francisco Garupe, secretly enter Japan on a mission to the country's underground Catholics. They are also hoping to learn the fate of their missing mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira who is rumoured to have committed apostasy under torture. The two men, however, are betrayed by their Japanese guide and arrested.I note that the film has been criticised on this board by some reviewers who accuse Scorsese of justifying European colonialism and of ""demonising"" non-Christian religions. Such criticisms, however, strike me as misguided, given that Scorsese's source novel was written by a Japanese novelist, not by a Westerner, and that the persecutions described by Endō are a matter of historical fact, not Christian propaganda. Now it is perfectly true that the Japanese may have had good reasons for being unwilling to import Christianity into their country; this was, after all, the period when the savage sectarian conflict known as the Thirty Years War was raging in Europe. 17th-century Catholics may have seen the persecution of their Japanese co-religionists as a great evil, but at this time their Holy Inquisition was persecuting Protestants with equal zeal and equal cruelty. (The Dutch, who had bitter memories of Spanish rule, made sure that the Japanese were kept informed of these events). Endō's theme, however, was not the iniquities of 17th-century Christianity, so I think that Scorsese was right not to deal with these matters directly. (He does, perhaps, hint at them by referring to Inoue, the Japanese official charged with rooting out Christianity, as ""The Inquisitor"").Endō, in fact, was more concerned with the motivation of the two Jesuits, especially Rodrigues, than he was with the political justification for the persecution. Like the great American-born Anglo-Catholic writer T S Eliot in ""Murder in the Cathedral"" he was interested in the psychology and theology of martyrdom. Many Christians would insist that a martyr dies the most glorious of all Christians, but Eliot recognised that there can be bad reasons for seeking martyrdom- vanity, stubbornness, spiritual pride and the desire to be foremost in the Kingdom of Heaven. Rodrigues comes to a similar realisation in the course of this drama. If he sacrifices his own life to satisfy his desire for glory, this will only increase the suffering of his Japanese flock, while if he follows Ferreira into apostasy their sufferings may be mitigated. (Endō's title refers to Rodrigues' perception that God is remaining silent while his faithful servants are persecuted).Scorsese's original choice for Rodrigues was Daniel Day-Lewis, who I am sure would have been excellent; he has been excellent in just about every film I have seen him in. By 2016, however, the director clearly considered that Day-Lewis was too old to play the relatively youthful Rodrigues, so cast a much younger actor, Andrew Garfield. This was the first time that I had seen Garfield in a film, and I must say that he was excellent in every way as the tortured Rodrigues, a man facing an unenviable dilemma; he can only save his friends from further suffering if he denies everything which has hitherto given his life meaning.Two other key roles are played by Liam Neeson as Ferreira and Yōsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro. Like the Fourth Tempter to Becket in ""Murder in the Cathedral"", Ferreira offers Rodrigues the temptation to ""do the right thing for the wrong reason"". He claims to admire the Japanese, but attempts to justify his own apostasy in terms which reveal his secret contempt for them. For him Japan is a ""swamp"" and its inhabitants are ignorant, backward people incapable of understanding true Christianity (by which he means European Christianity). He wrongs the Japanese martyrs, claiming that they died not for the true faith but for some distorted, dimly understood, perversion of it, possibly because he is ashamed that these humble people proved themselves more faithful Christians then he did.Kichijiro, a drunken, cowardly fisherman and a nominal Christian, is the guide who betrays Rodrigues and Garupe. Although this is far from being his only act of betrayal, he finds himself unable to abandon Christianity altogether. When we last see him he is being arrested for possession of a Christian amulet, protesting unconvincingly that he won it at gambling without realising its true nature.Scorsese's visual style, in keeping with the overall mood of the film, is dark and sombre. The film has been criticised on account of its length (160 minutes) but I felt that a longer running-time was needed here to allow its ambitious themes to be dealt with fully. This is an epic movie- not an action-drive epic like, say, ""Ben-Hur"", but an epic of faith and ideas. It is also a masterpiece, one of Scorsese's greatest works, ranking alongside the likes of ""Taxi Driver"", ""King of Comedy"", ""The Aviator"" and ""Shutter Island"". 10/10",Silence

30,lasttimeisaw,SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence,8,23 March 2017,"From this reviewer's view point as an agnostic, the excruciating question of religious faith, or in fact, any form of belief, is so rigorously emphasized on a person's exterior conduct, but since our ""real"" thoughts can only be accessed by ourselves (or the Almighty, if he exists), thus, what is the big fuss if a Christian steps or spit on Jesus' effigy, which doesn't necessarily means he apostatizes, because he is the only person who knows about his faith, and if he chooses keeping one's faith intact inwardly and truly, he is still a good Christian in every respect, not to mention in doing so, he can save innocent lives. That's one tough lesson learned by the young Father Rodrigues (Garfield) in Martin Scorsese's passion project SILENCE.Stuck in pre-production limbo for ages, SILENCE is a self-proclaimed triumph simply because of its very own existence, majorly shot in Taiwan as a surrogate of Japan, it is a tortuous crucible for the two Portuguese Jesuit priests Rodrigues and Garupe (Driver, galvanized with astonishing physical transformation in his latter scenes), to assume their duties in a Christianity-persecuting Japan in the 17th century, with a covert mission to find out what has happened to their mentor Father Ferreira (Neeson), who has been propagating gospel in Japan for over 15 years, but the recent tiding says he has renounced his faith after succumbing to the torture from Japanese authorities.Breathtaking cinematography is a default attraction borne out of its exotic locale, and SILENCE doesn't disappoint from DP Rodrigo Prieto, who is landed with the film's sole Oscar nomination, luxuriant mountains, inclement weather, decrepit villages, grim shorelines, Stygian and foggy night sailing, are the visual accoutrements of the priests and their poverty-ridden believers' trials and tribulations. Unavoidably, glancing exclusively through a westerner's eyes, there is no excuse of Japanese government's high-handed cruelty towards those wretched citizens, which Scorsese doesn't flinch from presenting with explicitness, and one might argue at certain point, this monotonous practice almost shades into a religious torture porn - the opprobrium which Mel Gibson's astronomically lucrative THE PASSION OF THE Christ (2004) once notoriously received, it turns out, when wrestling with contentious religious topics, not much one can do to avoid being curtained by personal angles, whether you are the populist Gibson, or a more cinema-savvy Scorsese. (Coincidentally, Garfield is the star of both SILENCE and Gibson's HACKSAW RIDGE 2016, comparing their orbit in the past Awards season, it shows that the populace does plump for the less thornier one, even it is too on-the-nose in its thudding message).Here, the message is more opaque, after Rodrigues' meandering faith-clinging-and-violence- witnessing struggle comes to a halt when Ferreira appears in front of his eyes, Rodrigues' final capitulation shows up his own shortcoming: he yens for dying as a martyr, like J.C. before him, he can endure any corporeal affliction for higher goals, because he wants to believe he is the chosen one here on earth like the former (when he sees J.C.'s image in his own reflection), so what devastates him is that he is exempted from physical crucifixion, alternatively, the devious Japanese inquisitor Inoue Masashige, played by Ogata with affectedly slippery, inflicts him with the burden and responsibility of the sorry ends of other God-botherers, that stratagem effectively dashes Rodrigues' high-minded illusion and degrades him as a mere mortal, and ultimately he makes the choice as any sensible human would do under that circumstances, and in due time, makes peace with his religion in the closing scene penetrated by a textually surreal shot, when all is said and done, as amorphous and exclusive as one's own faith is, still, Scorsese needs a token to vouchsafe his reckoning - the little cross. So, my take of this film is less trenchant a testing ground of how one can sustain his faith when facing appalling adversity than a finger-wagging to our nature's innate egoism, superiority and self-righteousness, after all, humility is and will always be the linchpin of human race, it is the only way to reach one's peaceful niche and immune to the omnipresent vice.Garfield takes up another formidable gauntlet and sinks his teeth into a deep-dish tormented character, stoutly embodied with anguish, doubt, obstinacy, disillusion with a shade of dewy-eyed callowness, as for Neeson, he leaves a more neutral tinge of ambiguity in a much hyped character, meanwhile the Japanese cast is purely adornments, more often than not, teetering on the brink of one-note (Asano) or repugnance (Kubozuka).The losing battle is the self-aware religion debate, which encompasses the big chunk of the conversations between two conflicted denominations, but accentuating God's silence, which de facto is religion's most overt attribute, as the clincher of the central story (God has always been, and hopefully will always be remaining in silence, so why would that be a matter of contest to his faithful disciple at any rate? Wouldn't it be a proviso which every intake has to accept before taking one's vow?), takes some shine of this film's profoundness and empathy. It is a hard-sell, but if Scorsese can't pull if off, one might wonder who else in Hollywood can?",Silence
31,Hellmant,Definitely one of Scorsese's best!,10,24 January 2017,"'SILENCE': Five Stars (Out of Five) Martin Scorsese's new historical epic, which has been a passion project of his for over 25 years! The film is adapted from the 1966 novel, of the same name, by Shusaku Endo; which has been adapted into a movie once before (in Japan, in 1971). Scorsese directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay, with Jay Cocks; who also co-wrote 'GANGS OF NEW YORK' and 'THE AGE OF INNOCENCE' (both directed by Scorsese). The story revolves around two 17th-century Jesuit priests, that travel to Japan, from Portugal, to find their missing mentor; who is reported to have renounced his faith there. The film stars Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, Liam Neeson, Tadanobu Asano and Ciaran Hinds. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, it was named one of the ten best movies of the year (by the American Film Institute), and it's expected to be a major Oscars contender. I think it's an absolute masterpiece.Two Portuguese Jesuit priests, Father Sebastiao Rodrigues (Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Driver), learn that their mentor, Father Cristovao Ferreira (Neeson), supposedly committed apostasy; in Japan, years earlier, after being tortured there. The two priests do not believe this information is true though, and they decide to travel to Japan to find out the real truth. Once they arrive in Japan, they learn that all Christians there have been forced to go into hiding; and many are executed if they're discovered. Rodrigues and Garupe struggle to keep their faith, while they're also put through a grueling test to renounce it.I have mixed feelings about what Scorsese is trying to say (about Catholicism) in this movie; and I'm not even completely sure what the film's true message is. Being raised a strict Catholic though, I'm fascinated by movies that deal with religion; and I think Scorsese is a very talented filmmaker at bringing them to life. The movie is always intriguing, highly involving, and breathtakingly beautiful to watch. Garfield is fantastic in the lead role, and I think his character is very sympathetic; I think almost anyone can relate to being forced to go against what you've always believed, in order to accomplish a greater good. The movie is a pure masterpiece, and it's definitely one of Scorsese's best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/B4EI2AvkLgo",Silence

The start of the movie, where the priests lie low, is confusing; the scenes involving murder almost unbearable to watch; the conclusion drawn out, undramatic and slow. We don't really get any sense of what Japanese society was really like, why and how people believed, or even how they lived day-to-day; the focus in relentlessly on the Job-like agony of the priests, heroically refusing to denounce a God who has forsaken them.

34,MOscarbradley,One of Scorsese's very best films,10,13 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese has wanted to make ""Silence"" for a very long time, (he secured the rights to Shusaku Endo's novel 28 years ago), and now that he has I am happy to report that this is one of his greatest films and one of the finest films to deal with religion and spirituality ever made. It is the story of Father Rodrigues, (a magnificent Andrew Garfield, virtually never off the screen), one of two Jesuit priests, (the other is played by Adam Driver), smuggled into a 17th century Japan in which Christians, and priests in particular, are being put to death. They are there to find their former spiritual mentor Father Ferreira, (Liam Neeson in a small but commanding role), who it is rumored has denied his faith.This is a long film, (almost three hours), and concentrates almost entirely on Father Rodrigues, who is portrayed here as a Christ figure complete with his own personal Judas, (a superb Yosuke Kubozuka). Will he find Father Ferreira and will he deny his own faith or suffer martyrdom? The film never deviates from this central theme and Scorsese and his cast, (there's great work, too, from Issei Ogata in Oscar-worthy form and Tadanobu Asano among his tormentors), never slackens their grip. This is Scorsese at his most austere, art-house rather than multiplex Scorsese with no concessions to his audience. It is absolutely not to be missed.",Silence

36,dromasca,question and answers,7,13 April 2017,"Why is (or was) God silent is a key question for believers. Why was God silent when Christians were prosecuted and died for their religion in the 17th century in Japan? Why was God silent when Jews were prosecuted by the Catholic Inquisition and died for their religion at the very same time? Or when Christians fought and killed each other in the European religious wars in the same century? Or during the Holocaust? Or today when people are prosecuted, fly for their lives and die for their religion in so many parts of the Globe? Is (or was) God silent? Or maybe He did speak and we did not hear Him? Those are the questions asked in Martin Scorsese's 'Silence'. Are these questions asked in a generic manner, or just limited to his own faith, and to the specific period he deals with? Are the answers the film gives convincing? The experience may depend on the viewer's close or remote relation to faith. The story of the two Catholic priests who are traveling in AD 1640 in Japan at one of the most cruel periods of persecution of Christians, their encounter with the different culture and religions, their fight to help the devote local Catholics who were continuing to stick to their belief, their own personal fight with the doubts and the apparent silence of the Divinity, their dilemma the ultimate choice that they need to make between saving lives and their own soul, between martyrdom and apostasy - all these may speak a lot to believers in general and Catholics in particular. From that perspective, this is the Via Dolorosa story with a different ending. What if as viewer one does not belong to either of these categories? These viewers are left with a film of exquisite cinematographic beauty but with a slow and unconvincing story telling, quite surprising for a master director as Martin Scorsese is.There is a secondary story here of the relationship between the priest father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and the local fisherman who helps and then betrays the two priests Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka). It's an extension of the Jesus - Judah story, a continuation maybe of the relation between the two described in Scorsese's 1988 'The Last Temptation of Christ', and one more work that deals with the story of Judah, part of a trend of 'rehabilitation' of the character, at least in films and books. I liked this part, and the acting in general (not to forget Liam Neeson who always fills any screen he is on). I liked less the long off-line monologue which becomes quite repetitive at some point, the 'Deus ex machina' off-screen voice that shows up at a key moment, and the odd epilogue that does not add too much to the story, is told in a different style and from a different perspective. Maybe it's just Scorsese's way of making sure that we place the story he is telling in the historical context? Did he really need this?One of my friends wrote after reading the original version of my short review: 'It is an experience more than a movie to watch.' I agree with her. Seeing 'Silence' is like visiting a church. Christians and non-Christians, believers and non-believers, everybody has a different experience, remarks and appreciates different things.",Silence
37,ThomasDrufke,Scorsese's Passion Project,7,16 January 2017,"We're lucky to have this film in theaters. Martin Scorsese worked to get it made for close to 30 years. While I can't fault the importance or overall uniqueness, the final product isn't exactly the easiest to connect to.Scorsese makes notoriously long epics. Most of the time, I enjoy the length and they can even leave me wanting more. The man is just that good at filmmaking. He's also consistently produced some of the most memorable scripts, whether they're written by him or someone else, over the last several decades. Silence contains some 'best of' Scorsese for sure; including a maniacal but fleshed out antagonist, several brutally relentless scenes, and some magnificent performances. But I'm not sure this ranks near a top 10 list for his career as an overall feature.Not starring Leonardo DiCaprio nor Robert De Niro, Scorsese got Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson to head this historical epic dealing with two Jesuit priests and their trek to find their mentor in faith, who they refuse to believe has apostatized. Especially during a time when Christianity was banned in Japan, this voyage is a fascinating trial of faith and reserving what you believe in, even if it means torture or death. A similarly themed movie, Hacksaw Ridge, also starring Andrew Garfield was released earlier this year. Both movies are well-made, brilliantly acted (although I think Garfield was better in Hacksaw), gorgeously shot, and portrayed thought provoking themes and ideas throughout.With that said, I don't think Silence is as interesting as it could have been. With a glaringly slow pace, by the end of the film you are so drained with the experience of these two priests that it's hard to want to spend any more time thinking about the story at hand. I also found it a little difficult to connect to the characters, because of how far we are removed from that time-period. Some can certainly say that some of the same belief issues are going on in today's world, which is fair, but the aesthetic of mid 1600's Japan felt very separated from our world. Which I guess, can also be contributed as a compliment to Scorsese's ability to transport you to a different era via set design and cinematography.I liked Silence. I think it brings up interesting questions involving faith and showcased what was once a world torn by religion pretty flawlessly. I just wish it was easier to connect with the characters, the run-time cut down, and the pacing be picked up.+You get a feel for what this world was like to live in+Fascinating themes+Brutal-Slow burn-Besides a few memorable scenes, the characters needed to be easier to connect to7.3/10",Silence

40,tomgillespie2002,Scorsese's most personal film to date,8,15 April 2017,"At the age of 74 and with 50-odd years in the business, Martin Scorsese shows no sign of letting up, whether it be in terms of quantity or quality. His movies are still routinely up for all the big awards, and his name alone is enough to sell a picture (although the presence of Leonardo Di Caprio in recent years will surely have had a hand in that). His last feature, The Wolf of Wall Street, saw the director at his most free-spirited, spinning a tale of white- collar crime that was both incredibly funny and outrageously over- the-top. It now feels like Scorsese may have been flushing some pent-up energy out of his system before he finally tackled a passion project 25 years in the making: his long talked-about adaptation of Shusaku Endo's novel Silence.In 17th-century Japan, Christians are being forced to renounce their beliefs in the face of horrific torture, as a samurai referred to as 'the inquisitor' prowls small villages hoping to snuff out anyone hiding religious idols with the image of Christ or the cross. In Macau, Jesuit priests Sebastiao Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) learn that their former tutor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who had travelled to Japan to spread the word of God, has apostatised and integrated himself into Japanese society. Believing the rumour to be nothing but propaganda, the two priests travel to Japan with the help of drunken sailor Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka), who has witnessed first hand the brutal acts of the inquisitor. Upon arriving in Nagasaki, Rodrugues and Garupe find poor communities going to desperate lengths to worship in secret as eyes and ears lurk everywhere.Scorsese has spoken often about his Catholicism, and has made it the subject of many of his best works. The most obvious being The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), but you can trace themes of Catholic guilt way back to Mean Streets (1973). A few of the characters in Silence struggle with the absence of God, and Rodrigues in particular struggles to comprehend a God who would sit back as thousands are tortured and murdered because of their faith. Scorsese explores this theme in a slow, considered manner, and it's clear that this may be the most personal film he's ever made. At almost 3 hours, the scope and vision of the story are a perfect fit for Scorsese's eye for classical film-making. There are plenty of beautifully framed shots, capturing both the beauty of the landscape and the brutality dwelling within. With a cast full of Japanese faces unfamiliar to Western audiences and a narrative happy to dwell on contemplative conversations, it's no wonder that this is one of the film-maker's lowest-grossing movies in years, but there is plenty to savour here from a purely cinematic perspective.When I first heard about the film, I wondered why Scorsese hadn't opted for Driver, who is clearly the stronger screen presence of the two leading actors, in the central role. But, combined with his Oscar-nominated performance in Mel Gibson's Hacksaw Ridge earlier this year, Garfield has cemented himself as a compelling leading man, and has finally rid himself of Sony's Amazing Spider-Man stigma. Driver has surprisingly limited screen-time, but he commands the screen whenever he's on it. The same can be said for Neeson, who leaves an impact in what adds up to only a handful of scenes. The film belongs to Garfield, whose boyish good-looks make his inner turmoil all the more gut-wrenching, as he watches folk put to death by high-tide crucifixion or burned at the stake, after they refuse to take part in a symbolic denouncement of faith by stepping on a slab with the image of Jesus. It received only a solitary Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, but it seems Scorsese made this for himself, and the most personal visions can speak the loudest of words.",Silence
41,cruise01,Silence has its raw unease moments with Martin Scorsese's direction and also very slow moving.,6,29 March 2017,"The latest Martin Scorsese historical drama film following the Jesuit priests traveling to Japan to find one of their own that went missing. Scorsese's film is well focused on story telling this historical story, also delivering some great performances from Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. Silence may be short on being one of Martin Scorsese's better films like The Departed, The Wolf of Wall Street, etc. In the 17th Century, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are sent on a mission to look for a missing priest Ferrera (Liam Neeson). When he was last heard in Japan, where they are trying to renounce the Christianity faith and torture to those who would not give up their faith. Martin Scorsese is great at being a storyteller in his movie scripts and direction. I like the concept going over the ""hidden Christians"" era when the conflict in Japan of the shogunate is trying persuade the village people in their country to renounce their Christian faith. With Father Rodrigues and Garupe visiting the village citizens and to see that they are still holding on to their Christian faith. Even as they have mass in hiding at night. When Rodrigues is feeling like he is being tested as he witnesses innocent people being tortured unless they renounce their beliefs. It is a powerful moving film. Rodrigues holding onto what he believes in, no matter the challenges that he is facing. The cinematography has its raw tone, and the music score kept to the minimum and with the outdoor noise of Japan being heard in the background from waves sound, a silent moment with crickets noise, etc. The set design was beautiful. Some unease feeling when seeing how people are being treated for what they believe in. Andrew Garfield did a great job with his performance and Adam Driver as well. The film is very slow moving with its storytelling. Does take a while for it to set up its story. Clocking in at a running time of two and half hours. The film can also be boring, seeing Rodrigues being taunted and he rejects the idea of giving up his faith which can go on for almost an hour. May not be one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The acting and direction is the spotlight of this movie. While the rest falls in the slow moving story of a historical drama that hasn't been told before.Overall, Silence is a fair film, great performances, and strong direction.

42,eddie_baggins,A gruelling but worthwhile experience,8,12 February 2017,"One of the harder watches of recent memories and an experience likely to drive a high percentage of ill-informed audience members scrambling for the exit signs before its conclusion, Martin Scorsese's long gestating passion project Silence, upon reflection is certainly not an easy film to recommend.Slowly paced, perhaps a little too long in the tooth, uncompromising in its intentions and more than a few times quite confrontational, this piece of art and quickly forgotten about epic by one of cinemas most renowned voices will divide many but there's little doubt this almost masterpiece is a unique and layered film that is unlike anything else we cinema goers have seen before.Adapting Shûsaku Endô renowned novel of the same name, Scorsese and his impressive behind the scenes team including regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker, costume designer Ellen Lewis and some stunning and well deserved Oscar nominated D.O.P work by Rodrigo Prieto who gives Silence an almost otherworldly feel as he uses the Taiwanese locations to great effect have set out to create a largely word driven experience that ponders the idea of faith of beliefs whilst shining a light on the plight of Christians in 1600 centaury Japan where they were often required to lay their lives on the line for their very beliefs.The audience is thrown into this world as Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver's Father Garrpe, both Jesuit priests tasked with unlocking the mysterious disappearance of Liam Neeson's fellow preacher Father Ferreira find themselves in the beautiful yet unforgiving lands of the Japanese and from a seemingly simple set-up Scorsese uses the narrative to explore various religious themes and debates that may leave many audience members numb mixed with boredom whilst others will be tightly enthralled by the spell cast within a film that seems intent on letting its story play out before our eyes with nothing pressing it forward at any great speed.Silence's greatest weakness in the form that it has come out in is within its lack of warm emotional resonance and while sympathy and sorrow is found throughout, the ties that bind such an epic film are left wanting when it comes to a bond formed between the audience and the travails of these faithful Christian's.Largely led by Garfield's Rodrigues, a turn in which on the back of Hacksaw Ridge suggests the young actor has entered into another level of his career, Silence often feels as though it's one tiny moment away from landing a big emotional wallop but it never comes and while it's a nice change of pace to see Scorsese away from the sometimes showmanship nature of his recent films like Wolf of Wall Street there are times where Silence may've benefited from a little more of the directors famed pizazz.It's not hard to see why Silence has failed to capture traction at the Box Office or why it was largely shunned at Awards ceremonies over the previous months and while disappointing in certain regards it feels unwise to discount this eye capturing event as a film that will live long into the coming years as its future fans discover a hidden gem just waiting to be discovered and discussed by those that find it a true conversation starter.A unique entry into the stunning filmography of a master storyteller, Silence is a passion project with rough edges and missed opportunities but a project that rewards on many levels while offering more deep thinking ponderings than many other films would dare to dream up and is likely to be an experience that will reward those willing to give the film chances to grow over multiple viewings, no matter how hard a trek it may be.4 confessions out of 5",Silence
43,howard.schumann,Shines a light on the inadequacy of both secular materialism and fundamentalist religion,9,15 January 2017,"Christianity came to Western Japan in 1542 by way of Jesuit missionaries from Portugal who brought gunpowder and religion. They were welcomed mostly for the weapons they brought and their religion was allowed to be practiced openly. Christianity was banned, however, after reports circulated of missionary intolerance towards the Shinto and Buddhist religions, and there were rumors of the sale of Japanese into overseas slavery. It wasn't until the late 1630s, however, that a complete ban on Christianity was declared and enforced by the Tokugawa Shogunate and persecutions, torture, and murders were relentlessly pursued.Based on Shusaku Endo Edo's 1966 historical novel culled from the oral histories of Japanese Catholics, Martin Scorsese's masterful film Silence brings us face to face with the repression faced by the early missionaries. While the film does not condone the subjugation of religious minorities, it examines the advisability of attempting to convert a country's population without a deep understanding of their beliefs and traditions. The film opens in 1635 as two Jesuit priests, Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield, ""Hacksaw Ridge"") and Francesco Garrpe (Adam Driver, ""Paterson""), request permission from their superior Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds, ""Bleed for This"") to go to Japan to discover the fate of their mentor, Father Cistavio Ferreira (Liam Neeson, ""A Monster Calls""), rumored to have renounced his faith and to be living with a Japanese wife.The missionaries are not unaware of the persecution and murder of thousands of peasants and priests who have converted to Christianity, yet they are anxious to undertake their dangerous mission to support the local Christians and to find out the truth about Father Ferreira. When they arrive in Japan they are greeted by a group of ""hidden Christians"" known as ""kakure kirishitan"" who have been compelled to publicly renounce their faith and go into hiding to practice their faith in secret, knowing that anyone can earn 100 pieces of silver for turning in a Christian to the authorities and 300 pieces for surrendering a priest. Here, the two priests hear confessions and give baptisms and say mass in the middle of the night In order to avoid capture.Working with such past collaborators as Editor Thelma Schoonmaker (""Learning to Drive""), Production Designer Dante Ferretti (""Cinderella""), and Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""The Wolf of Wall Street""), Scorsese does not hold back in showing the graphic nature of the torture that those who are arrested must endure. This includes beheadings, being wrapped in straw and burned alive or thrown into the sea. Some are mounted on a cross and placed in the sea until death comes mercifully after repeated pounding of the waves against them. For some, to die a martyr is a high calling, one which will be rewarded in the afterlife and they accept their fate willingly similar to today's Islamic suicide bombers.Rodrigues, however, now separated from Garrpe, takes on a Christ-like appearance and begins to see himself as the personification of Jesus. He now must choose between rigidly maintaining his religious beliefs or saving the lives of innocent villagers by surrendering to the audacious Inquisitor (Issey Ogata) by placing his foot on a carved Christian icon known as a fumie, an act tantamount to renouncing his faith. In doing so, Rodrigues thinks about Kichijiro (Yôsuke Kubozuka, ""Deadman Inferno""), a convert who continually begs for the Sacrament of Penance after he apostasizes again and again. The issues are further crystallized when Rodrigues confronts the truth about Father Ferreira.While Silence does not fully achieve the transcendence of a true spiritual epic, Scorsese should be acknowledged for opening up the space for a meaningful inquiry into a subject that has perplexed countless philosophers and students of religions for centuries. Perhaps inadvertently, the film, however, does shine a light on the inadequacy of both secular materialism and fundamentalist religion to satisfy our true spiritual needs and answer the overriding question of the film. This must be answered by each person through their own direct experience. For me, to know God is to embrace the silence, to live in it, and know that it is the ""source of all sound.""",Silence
44,TheMovieDiorama,Silence nullifies you through viscerally stunning imagery and faithfully religious themes.,8,20 July 2018,"Many of you may know that I am not a massive fan of Scorsese unlike most aficionados. In addition, you may have acknowledged the fact that I also dislike long runtimes. Silence is, ironically, directed by Scorsese and boasts a 160 minute theatrical length. Much to my surprise, this was absolutely gorgeous. Two missionaries journey to Japan in search for their missing mentor who has been captured. The Shimabara Rebellion is an important event in religious history. The suppression of Roman Catholicism in 17th Century Japan, a religion deemed dangerous by high-ranking indigenous officials. Scorsese, along with Cocks' screenplay, managed to craft a thematic adaptation that encapsulates the utmost cinematic quality. Conveying the power of religious devotion without glorifying martyrdom was always a difficult task. Resorting to blood and violence would've been easy, yet Scorsese instead focused on the everlasting conflict in human nature. Rodrigues, played enigmatically by Garfield, is pure. Forever devoted to his faith and spreading his beliefs of Catholicism to the Japanese peasants. Even during ultimatums that could result in death, he remained defiant. But the relentless acts of torture and martyrs sacrificing themselves in the name of God started to taint his ideologies. Questioning the very existence of his religion. The visual storytelling and minimal dialogue eloquently hones in on the emotion of self-doubt. You can visualise the inner torment within these characters of having to renounce Christianity. Apostatising or disaffiliating one's self from faith feels like death in itself to these individuals. Utterly powerful. Driver and Neeson both act as valuable assets in personifying the power of religion, platforming Garfield to scenes of pure emotional vulnerability. The supporting Japanese cast all performed well, although certain translations may have needed subtitles due to the lack of clear pronunciation, was slightly difficult to articulate. Prieto's cinematography was spellbinding. The darkened blue nights to the vivid green forests all captured the aesthetic beauty of rural Japan. The absence of a musical score surprised me, and felt like a double-edged sword. It managed to enhance the tension, particularly during the long takes of peasants being strapped to wooden crosses waiting for the crashing waves of the sea to drain their remaining energy. But simultaneously it reduced the cinematic presence of the film. Emotional resonance was subdued to the lack of instrumentality, and I do view that as a flaw. A few minor criticisms here and there, but for a project that has nearly spanned two decades, Scorsese should be proud. A passion project that raises fundamental questions whilst also producing a coherently beautiful story. I was silenced throughout.",Silence

Their superior agrees, despite the clear and present danger to venture out in Christianity-hostile Japan. When Rodrigues and Garupe get smuggled into Japan, much to their surprise they find there is a thriving underground Christian community. But it isn't long before the dangers start popping up... At this point, we're 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is Martin Scorsese's long awaited (over 2 decades) ""religious"" film, about the trials and turbulations of Jesuit priests in 17th century Japan. While things are happening pretty quickly in the initial 20 min. of the movie, they are most definitely slowing down to a glacial speed in the middle 90 min. of the movie. So if you are expecting some sort of an epic historical action-drama, please adjust your expectations immediately (in particular as it relates to the ""action"" parts), otherwise you are bound to be let down, if not outright disappointed. I think the movie's running time is in fact too long, and could've easily be trimmed by probably 15-20 without losing much of the narrative. That said, if you can hang in until we get to the last 45 min., you are bound for a wonderful payoff. I thought the last part of the film was nothing short of mesmerizing. The central theme of the movie (will Rodrigues renounce his faith to save himself, like Ferreira may have done?) plays out beautifully. ""I am so tempted to despair. The weight of your silence is terrible."", Rodrigues tells us in a voice over, and we hear his pain! Along the way, we are treated to a visual spectacle (has there been a movie containing more fogged landscapes that this one?). Andrew Garfield, MILES away from his erstwhile Spider-Man days and just after his equally acclaimed performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge"", is outstanding as Rodrigues. Adam Driver disappears from the movie altogether after just an hour (but for one short scene afterwards). Neeson makes an appearance both at the movie's very beginning and again in the last 30 min. When the end credits start rolling, Scorsese dedicates the movie to those that advanced catholicism in Japan, and adds for good measure Ad maiorem Dei gloriam (the Jesuit slogan, meaning For the Greater Glory of God).""Silence"" opened wide this past weekend, and under-performed at the box office. This does not surprise me, as it takes quite a commitment to sit through this overly long film. It it weren't for the movie's excellent last 45 min., I'd have rated less than what I am rating it now (4 stars. The early evening screening where I saw this at on MLK Day here in Cincinnati was not attended very well (about 10 people), and unless there is a a significant pick-up in Oscar nominations next week, I can't see this movie lasting much longer in theaters. That said, if you are a Scorsese fan, you will definitely want to check this out.",Silence
47,subxerogravity,Silence is Golden.,8,19 February 2017,"But let me be really loud about how much this movie amazed me. Man! Martin Scorsese, you really packed a wallop! \It's funny. My fav Marty movies are usually the violent ones but just because this flick does not have that engaging of physical confrontation I loved about the Departed and Mean Streets does not mean it does not have the same impact. It slaps you across the face especially if you are Christian, especially if you are a person who believes in freedom of religion.Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield played priest ( Even though I think both actors are Jewish) who go to japan to bring back the man who turn them to the faith and bring back the faith to japan only to find a country truly determine to purge Christianity from it. It is not the faith film that I was expecting to let you guys know about, but it was such a powerful story on Christianity that would have you talking like The Last Temptation of Christ.Plus it's a movie that really makes you think about things as everyone will have an opinion about what happen and everyone's opinions would be right and wrong at the same time.Marty proves that he's still a spectacular filmmaker with this one. It was raw and it was long but it hits the mark.http://cinemagardens.com",Silence
48,billcr12,Epic Scorcese,8,15 February 2017,"Martin Scorcese puts his creative heart on the screen for two hours and forty minutes with this extremely personal religious voyage through 1600's Buddhist Japan. Jesuit missionaries, Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield) and Garuppe(Adam Driver) are sent to Japan to search for Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson), who has disappeared and allegedly renounced his faith in order to avoid torture and execution by the Japanese. The pair of priests encounter Catholic converts on their journey and conduct mass in secret because of the severe penalties, including crucifixion, for those practicing the banned religion. Garfield is tremendous as Father Rodrigues and Liam Neeson transcends the deeply moving material, as Scorcese allows his actors to shine, including a mostly Japanese cast. The last fifteen minutes are as memorable as anything I have ever seen. The tortures on display are excruciating to watch, but are historically accurate and necessary. 2016 is a strange year for film, as we have the releases of both Silence and La La Land. The latter has a best director nomination but Martin Scorcese was ignored by the Academy; what a disgrace. Time will prove this to be a major mistake.",Silence
49,alindsay-al,A great really interesting film,8,2 January 2017,"Like most people I think Martin scorcese is a great director and I was interested in seeing his new film silence and I did really enjoy this film. The premise of this film sees two Catholics travel to Japan to find there teacher who has gone missing. Andrew garfield plays rodrigues The main priest In this film and I am sure there will be Oscar buzz around this performance. He is absolutely amazing in this film and truly commits to this role, he delivers a truly great performance with great depth as you see him go through this horrible journey and see him become more and more broken as the film progresses in a fantastic way. Adam driver plays the other priest in this film an he does a really good job with what he is given. He has less to do then Garfield but he still adds allot of depth to his character and you do care about his character. Liam neeeson plays the teacher and with his limited screen time does a great job of conveying why these men would go on this mission in the first place. The rest of the Japanese cast does a fantastic job too whether it's the inquisitor, the interpreter or the villagers they all deliver high quality performances that makes you truly care about where they go in this film. The story has really good depth in it as you see these two guys faith being questioned and you see them go through this really emotional journey through has you invested. However,it isn't the most fast paced film with its storytelling and the last third of the film drags quite allot and becomes predictable. The script is great with dramatic dialogue that you buy and makes you care about the characters in the film. A film like this has a lack of humour but it works for this film because of the subject matter. The style of this film is beautiful, if just based on cinematography alone this film would be a 10/10. But this films pacing is really sloppy, this is a very long film but it feels even longer and I just feel like there were parts of this film could have been cut out and it would have benefited the film. Overall this is a great interesting film that if your a fan of film is a must watch in my opinion.",Silence
50,kluseba,Unorthodoxically artistic,8,20 November 2017,"Silence is a quite ambitious project by star director Martin Scorsese and it isn't a surprise that this film has failed at the box office. It is particularly long with a running time of one hundred sixty-one minutes. The topic of Jesuits resisting persecution in feudal Japan is quite unusual. Aside of Liam Neeson, who only has about ten minutes of screen time, the movie focuses on rather unknown actors. Still, Silence is one of Martin Scorsese's best movies. It's obvious that he cared about this film and wanted to make it something special, regardless of grossing numbers.On the positive side, Silence grabs your attention with a topic that hasn't been treated much and might even be unknown to most audiences. Following the struggles of two Jesuits in feudal Japan who try to spread hope to the few isolated Christian communities while trying to find their mentor who hasn't come home from a mission almost feels like watching an elaborate documentary. The movie is historically authentic, includes fitting costumes and landscapes and exposes us to Japanese and Portuguese customs.Secondly, the acting performances in this movie are absolutely stellar. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver have good chemistry and convince as initially motivated Jesuits whose faith is severely tested in their quest for survival. The supporting actors are also quite convincing from a resilient, old and clever inquisitor to a disillusioned, insisting and rational convert.Thirdly, the movie has a quite sinister atmosphere that fits the serious topics. This is supported by the rural landscapes since most of this movie either takes place on the raw coasts of Southern Japan, the wild forests of several Japanese islands and the muddy city of Nagasaki where it always seems to rain. The dark lighting techniques, the gloomy soundtrack and the use of moments of tense silence also contribute to a very artistic, detailed and epic movie.On the negative side, the film is obviously quite long. I didn't get bored at any time because I found the topic so fascinating but I have to admit that some scenes are somewhat redundant or repetitive. If you are looking for a movie with vivid action sequences, numerous different locations and long-winded dialogues, you won't get any of it. This movie is slow-paced, precise and atmospheric and tries to transmit a desperate vibe instead of quirky entertainment.The ending of the movie blends in very well with the rest of the film and I liked it but it's quite unorthodox and maybe even unexpected by Hollywood standards.To keep it short, it's great to see that renowned directors like Martin Scorsese still aspire to experiment in the autumn years of their careers. Silence is refreshingly different and unique from any other Hollywood production of recent memory. It has a unique topic, great acting performances and an intense atmosphere. If you are a viewer with an interest in historical topics who likes to think outside the box, you're probably going to appreciate Silence as much as I did.",Silence
51,andrewchristianjr,DIFFICULT TO WATCH.,9,23 May 2020,"A saddening but amazing story that is misunderstood by some.

Some movies are difficult to watch, but the experience still enriches you. This was one such movie for me.",Silence
52,I_Ailurophile,Curious and outstanding,8,2 July 2021,"Whatever expectations I had of 'Silence' based on advance trailers, of a dynamic and dramatic movie, were wholly upended. This is an astoundingly understated feature, where the music listed in the credits is so subtle that I do not recall it in the film I just watched. The duration begins and ends with sparing ambient sounds - crickets, ocean waves - laid over a black screen. Every act of violence and feeling of anguish in the story is viewed as though from a distance, not directly experienced by the audience, with the unremarkable neutrality of an observer that diminishes emotional beats if not altogether rendering them sterile.This is a curious, thoughtful film, and while I enjoyed it, I don't know entirely what to think of it.This much is certain: Martin Scorsese is unquestionably a master film-maker. In word and in final realization it has been made very clear that 'Silence' has been a passion project for him for many years. While my knowledge of Scorsese's pictures is far from complete, I can think of very few films broadly, let alone those among his that I know, that were so obviously crafted with the utmost painstaking care. 'Silence' is driven by narrative, not by emotion or artfulness, yet it feels like every footfall, every word, every second of film were considered with the most calculated precision of intent. It's not difficult to imagine that every frame is laid out with the exact vision that Scorsese has held in mind over time.So many shots are surely eye-catching, and brilliantly arranged from both sides of the camera. The costume design and overall production design, overseen by Dante Ferretti, are phenomenal, as is wardrobe generally and set decoration. The filming locations were exquisite choices, making 17th-century Japan feel very real even from the comfort of my own home. In every technical sense, 'Silence' is a fantastic achievement.The actors assembled here all give outstanding performances, and in my mind that's true especially of the Japanese cast. Not to discount anyone, yet this goes most of all for Shinya Tsukamoto, excellent in his prominent role as devout Mokichi; Yosuke Kubozuka, as untrustworthy Kichijiro, struggling in his faith; and Issey Ogata, cool and casual in his malice and indifference as the antagonistic Inoue Masashige. Of course the big stars get our attention, too; Liam Neeson and Ciarán Hinds capably keep our attention while they're on screen. More surprising still are Adam Driver and especially Andrew Garfield. For both their relative youth and less prominent star power, to say nothing of the action blockbusters that mark their most recognizable roles, I balked when I first learned of their involvement. Yet both put in swell performances befitting the picture, and I feel confident that having proven their capabilities for a revered film-maker like Martin Scorsese, they have shown just what they can do in more dramatic parts.The aspect of 'Silence' where I get caught up a bit is with the narrative, simply because the subject matter is complex and charged. No matter the time or place, freedom to practice religion as one wishes is a quintessential human right, so long as it affects no one else, and any measure that would suppress that hallmark of civilization is to be abhorred. Indeed, the past history of active, violent resistance to outside religion in Japan, as vividly seen herein, should disturb anyone of conscience, and it does. Yet at the same time, as a non-believer, I particularly detest and oppose organized religion, and recognize the harm that comes with it. Where go white missionaries, soon follows colonization, expansion of sociopolitical and economic hegemony, subjugation and erasure of endemic culture, and worse. Moreover, there's a sickening inherent complex to structured faith, as illustrated in 'Silence,' that direly seeks persecution and martyrdom as a means of validation. With these points in mind, the refusal to allow a Western dogma to seed is more understandable and reasonable, even as the methods of repulsion remain excessive and extreme.For all these reasons, I find myself conflicted where this picture is concerned. 'Silence' is, I think, evenhanded and objective in its depiction of events, glorifying or sanctioning neither the Jesuits' proselytizing nor their aggressive quelling by the Japanese. This approach to storytelling allows the viewer to engage more earnestly with the narrative, seeking our own informed judgment of the saga just as the characters struggle alternately with doubt and resolve. It makes the watching experience more challenging - but also more rewarding.When all is said and done I do heartily enjoy 'Silence,' but I still wrestle with what to think of it more specifically. By no stretch of the imagination is this going to be a movie for everyone. Between the subject matter and violence, the weighty, understated tone, and the deliberate avoidance of dynamics, this is a film that requires a patient, attentive audience. Yet for anyone willing to engage with it honestly, 'Silence' is masterful and captivating, a monumental accomplishment that in time will surely be uplifted as one of Martin Scorsese's greatest works.Strong, reverberating recommendation.",Silence
53,s3276169,Read from the Silence what you will......,8,3 February 2017,"Silence is one of those films where what you take away from it depends on where you start from. My starting perspective is one of pragmatism and historical fact. The realities of the time saw Portugal as a world power. Much as the US is today. Its ambitions somewhat mirror those of their latter day counterparts too. Establish a strong presence in Japan with a view to exploit it for its resources. One of the key tools in that conversion was cultural assimilation. Get the locals to see things you way. One of the key tools to achieve this at the time, was religion. Religion infused every aspect of 17th century life. It offered solace in a world filled with hardship. It was used by states to keep the populace under control and compliant and that needs to be kept in mind when considering Silence. On the surface it would seem the Jesuit priests and their followers are victims of a cruelly enforced code of silence. To believe something and not be able to express it openly.This is no doubt true. Yet, whats just as true, is Christianity, at the time was just as intolerant and inflexible and used much the same methods, including torture and executions, to ensure its religion remained in control. This benefited both the state and the clergy.So what to make of Silence? Viewed as an historical document its fine. Its beautifully crafted, with stunning visuals and a great story. I would say its a little overstated at times and it would have been nice to for the film to focus a little more of its screen time on the apostate priests lives working as a religious ""customs service"" for the Japanese state. Sadly, this is compressed into the final quarter of the film. Being critical I would say it could have been more balanced and at least acknowledged more directly the brutality of religion as a political too on both sides of the East/West divide.That said, this remains an excellent film. Its well directed, acted and examines a fascinating period in human history where religion was the mainstay, that held the fabric of society together. Eight out of ten from me.",Silence
54,aharmas,I Can't Believe,4,24 December 2016,"""Silence"" is en experience, a trip into the hell some ""padres"" went through during their attempt to spread the Christian faith in Japan during the 1600's. The film tries to give us a peek into the treatment of the priests once the locals decided to institute a policy that found the practice of forbidden doctrines illegal and punishable. When the movie opens, we go straight to the depiction of some of the ways Japanese tortured some of the Christian followers.Next, plans are approved to start searching for one missing priest. It's the duty of two young priests to locate him, save him, maybe even do a little Christian work to save and enlighten a few souls. This is where the problem begins: There's something sloppy about the way the quest is introduced, and we have three characters who don't seem to even believe whatever comes of their mouths. One looks doubtful, the other is eager but his his eyes don't project any fire, and one seems to have wandered from another period, setting, and faith, maybe even another picture. He looks militant, irascible, doubtful this will have a positive ending. It seems as if he knows this is all futile--their enterprise and maybe the whole act of watching this film.When the two young men arrive in Japan, our own torture begins, as we listen to dialog that is both incomprehensible and stilted. Never we get into believing that these people have any commitment to anyone but themselves. I'm not sure if it is the acting, the directing, the endless scenes that appear to go in circles, never revealing or truly pulling all the different layers of a complex theme. The setting is dark, grungy, inhospitable, and very foreign. It is never clear why they decide to start their journey in the middle of the winter, or what appears to be the very foggy season in this island. It becomes annoying.Bring on the never ending series of psychological, physical, and amazingly, very little exploration of theological questions. In ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" one is willing to overlook some strange casting choices because the central figure is powerful, and well played by DeFoe, giving us a new perspective of what one of the most famous people in history must have gone through. Here, Rodriguez looks lost, both within the story, and Garfield is never anything but a selfish, whiny, and sick looking man of the cloth. I couldn't help thinking about the other long suffering fictional character of the year, Lee in ""Manchester by the Sea"". At least, we had a solid portrayal of pain, guilt, and impotence. ""Silence"" doesn't even give you a hint of any of those emotions.In addition, the length of the film is unbearable. Much doesn't happen for minutes. We have shots of the surroundings, conversations that highlight the redundancy that weakens the film. It is not as if there was nothing to discuss or explain. It felt like a jackhammer kept going and going, keeping us from engaging, from developing any sort of rhythm and connection to the material. The depiction of the torture and persecution never stopped, getting to the point that the ordeal of the troops captured by the Japanese in a recent World War II film appeared more like a prank by a bully. The torture scenes are not something to avoid because they're too graphic; however it feels like the ones being tortured are the members of the audience because we either have to suffer through the weak dialog which goes nowhere or another way in which the bad guys show their bad qualities, and/or, the Christians keep experiencing hell.There is a very reliable team behind the production. Sadly, there is also a pervasive realization that nothing really works. Landscapes and close ups are admirable in their clarity but drained of any emotions. The lack of musical score is jarring making the ""silence"" way too overbearing and boring. Costumes and sets might be accurate but feel empty because the characters are poorly presented, and I was wondering where the editor went because we could have easily removed 1/2 of the film, and we would have gotten the same amount of pertinent information. The only scenes that appeared to really work involve Liam Nesson, an actor whose presence and delivery allows us to have an idea of what really is going on. To make matters even worse, this makes every other performer look even worse.If anyone wants to see how spirituality can be shown, with and without the explicit reference to a particular faith, through beautiful cinematography and the perfect marriage of sound and visuals, check Mallick's ""The New World"". For now, some real silence seems more than appropriate.",Silence
55,truemythmedia,A Harrowing Journey,9,17 May 2019,"First and foremost, I want to say that this is one of the most faithful adaptions I've ever seen come to screen (though, surprisingly, the film ends with a little more hope). Scorsese recreates scenes perfectly, pulling in recurring images from the novel, whole lines of dialogue, but most importantly, the themes that permeate slowly, simmering through this boiling caldron of a film. This film is not fast paced; it builds slowly towards a depressing ending, much like the tide slowly coming in to drown the Christians tied to the crosses on the beach. The hope we find here is faint and far away, because the themes it deals with are some of the harder ones we as Christians have to deal with, particularly facing persecution while dealing with the distance of God.
This film is grueling and hard to watch, but purposefully so. I would argue that this is one of the most important Christian films ever made, but, sadly, the R rating will turn a lot of Christian viewers away. If you can get past the brutality of this movie, the rewards you will reap will be worth it. We, as Christians today, don't face the same persecution that these people did hundreds of years ago, but there are still moments of trial in each of our lives. All of us must wrestle with the distance of God, and why he allows certain things to happen in our own way. Know that God is still there, even if it sometimes seems like he's so far away.
Have faith, brothers and sisters.

56,davidmvining,One of Scorsese's greatest achievements,10,13 April 2021,"How do you follow up a movie about debauchery on Wall Street through the 90s? If you're Martin Scorsese, you make a deeply religious movie adaptation of a Japanese novel about Jesuit priests in feudal Japan, that's how. This was one of three major passion projects that Scorsese held onto for a number of years before finding the funding to make (the other two were The Last Temptation of Christ and Gangs of New York). Originally written with Jay Cocks (and the first Scorsese writing credit on one of his films since Casino) in the early 90s, Scorsese's efforts to get the film made waxed and waned for decades before the independent success of The Wolf of Wall Street allowed him to secure the nearly $50 million to make his film, shooting in Taiwan with two of America's up and coming leading men. The movie's theatrical release was completely botched by Paramount, and one of our greatest filmmaker's greatest films died a quiet box office death.In the 17th century, about a hundred years after St. Francis Xavier introduced Christianity to Japan, the shogunate made Christianity illegal, torturing and killing priests and Christians throughout the land in favor of the native Shinto religion. One priest, Father Ferreira, sent a letter back to the Jesuits at Macau, China, detailing the final extent of the persecution that took years to reach his Christian brothers. Two young priests, Father Rodrigues and Father Garupe, who had Ferreira for a teacher, were to be tasked with the dangerous mission of going to Japan, but the letter and other rumors of Ferreira's apostacy tell their supervisor that their mission is no longer necessary. Their fervor pushes them forward, and they are allowed to go.The Christianity they find in Japan is a scared one. With no priests, the community of Christians left huddle in secret and pray what they can, terrified of anyone outside of their community. Rodrigues and Garupe represent the first rays of light for these people in years, and yet they have no word of Father Ferreira who had settled in Nagasaki, not some small seaside community. Guiding them to the small village and another island off the coast is Kichijiro, a peasant Christian who has repeatedly apostatized to save his own life, most damagingly when he was the only one of his family to do so and he watched them burn alive.Kichijiro is the key to understanding this movie. He goes in and out of the story around Rodrigues, and Rodrigues grows increasingly impatient with him. Kichijiro keeps apostatizing, stepping on fumi-e with religious images in order to free himself from temporal danger manifested by the shogunate. Rodrigues, even as he gets into more and more desperate situations himself, must remain calm and understanding as he hears Kichijiro's confessions, all confessing the same sin over and over again.Rodrigues is almost like a Fellini protagonist in that he's caught between two worlds. As an educated priest, he understands the dogma more than anyone else in the country, but he's also a man with doubts. Those doubts grow as the film progresses. He prays for guidance, for deliverance, and for help, but all he's met with is silence. His lowest point is when he is crouching alone in the wilderness, after watching three of his flock tortured and killed, and he wonders if he's praying to nothing.Rodrigues and Garupe must split up as the shogunate's agent, the Inquisitor, gets closer. Rodrigues runs into Kichijiro who ends up turning Rodrigues in for the three hundred pieces of silver reward. Taken to Nagasaki to face the Inquisitor, the movie becomes a battle of wills, wits, and religions. In prison, comfortable physically and allowed to administer to the captured Christians with him, Rodrigues confronts the Inquisitor. They speak in metaphors back and forth about Christianity as a tree and Japan being unfavorable soil for the tree to take root. Rodrigues feels his faith strengthen, but Kichijiro gets captured, begs for forgiveness yet again, and apostatizes a few days later to save himself again. The Inquisitor has also adopted refined methods for dealing with priests.It's not about torturing the priests themselves. That makes them stronger in their faith and spreads the words of their martyrdom. No, he doesn't physically torture the priests, he tortures their followers. The irony of Rodrigues is that he begs his followers to apostatize to save themselves, but he can't bring himself to apostatize to save them. The worst part is when Father Ferreira appears. The rumors were true, he apostatized, took a Japanese wife, and is writing works in Japanese about the folly and untruth of Christianity. The sight of his mentor turning into such a disgrace crushes Rodrigues, but Ferreira's future is Rodrigues' own. As Rodrigues watches five fellow Christians hung upside down with slits in their neck so blood doesn't pool in their heads, all five of whom have already apostatized but are only being tortured for his sake, Rodrigues finally hears the voice of God, breaking the silence that has tortured him. The fumi-e of Christ speaks to him, begging him to step on him to save himself and his followers, which Rodrigues does.So, what's the point of all this? Is this saying that Christianity was wrong to enter Japan and disrupt Shinto's hold on the people because the Christians lose in the end? I've read that take, and it's such a wrongheaded take that I just can't believe someone would make it. No, this isn't a Christianity versus Shinto fight, this is tied to the dual journeys of Rodrigues and Kichijiro. Kichijiro keeps failing to live up to the Christian ideal, even as those around him, just as poor and normal as himself, rise up to the rank of martyrs for the faith. In a similar way, Rodrigues apostatized, he failed his faith, in order to save not himself but the innocents of his flock. Are Kichijiro and Rodrigues bad people because they failed? Are we all bad people because we are continuously guilty of the same sins again and again, because we fail to rise to the status of saints? The movie's final shot, an addition to the story not in the novel, shows a crudely made crucifix in Rodrigues' hand in his coffin, hidden there by his wife and originally made by one of the villagers from the beginning of the movie. The point that Kichijiro's final confession years after the main action of the film and the crucifix is that no matter how many times we fall, as long as we earnestly ask for forgiveness God will offer us absolution.This is not an easy movie to watch. It's about oppression, torture, faith, and death, but it's one of the most compelling visions I've seen. In a filmography as deep, varied, and fantastic as Martin Scorsese's, this stands out as one of his crowning achievements. He pulled career best performances from Andrew Garfield as Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Garupe. Issey Ogata as the Inquisitor is amazingly physical, reptilian, and overbearing. Yosuke Kubozuka is broken and earnest as Kichijiro. Liam Neeson carries a deep seeded fear underneath every word as Ferreira, perhaps hiding his true intentions and fidelity to Jesus despite his façade. The soundtrack is almost entirely nature sounds of ocean waves, wind in trees, and birds, a marked contrast to the use of diagetic music that defines Scorsese's career. The quiet power of the entire package is potent and lasting. That this movie was so mishandled by the distributor saddens me. This deserved a more educated rollout, not being dumped in theaters right before Christmas with nary a marketing budget to do much of anything.This is a triumph of a film. An emotionally wrenching piece of cinema asking hard questions of its characters and its audience about their goodness in times of crisis. As Kichijiro says, ""Years ago, I could have died a good Christian. There was no persecution. Why was I born now? This is so unfair.""I adore this film.",Silence

However the acting is outstanding with all parties involved. The scenes are shot with the eye of a film master. The scenes are visceral and realistic.

58,jadepietro,Scorsese's Preachy Sermon,6,7 February 2017,"(RATING: ☆☆☆ out of 5)THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: In the hands of master filmmaker, Martin Scorsese has made a beautifully crafted but preachy (and boring) historical drama.GRADE: C+JIM'S REVIEW: Similarities with other sources abound in Martin Scorsese's epic film, Silence. Two missionaries are sent to a foreign country to spread the word of their prophet. No, it's not Roland Joffe's The Mission, Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast, James Clavell's Shogun, or, for that matter, The Book of Mormons...although if the film has some comedy or musical numbers, it would have at least been memorably. The film is actually more akin to Apocalypse Now...as these two envoys are sent on a mission to stop a former leader who has fallen from grace. Not the Vietnam War, where thousands were brutally killed...rather the Holy War, where thousands were brutally killed. Here the battle is over religious souls in this cinematic philosophic debate of a film.Set in the 17th century, this historical drama follows two Jesuit priests, Father Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver), whose mission is to travel to Japan and rescue their former mentor, Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neesom) from renouncing his faith. As they journey to a strange land, they are met with a violent culture that will stop Christianity by any means possible and demand apostasy (the renunciation of one's religious tenets) or death to any of its worshipers. The padres cling to their faith while their flock is sadistically slaughtered in grisly detail.One cannot deny that Silence is grandiose filmmaking. Mr. Scorsese knows how to craft his tale with enough style and dramatic flourishes. One could not expect less from its great director, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jay Cocks. His images are on an epic scale and the photography by Rodrigo Prieto is just glorious to behold. But there are inherent problems with the screenplay film itself. Silence trips up on its own words. The film regurgitates scenes of torture, both psychological and physical, that weaken the overall impact and border on the excessive. Its talk-torture-talk-torture format becomes redundant.While the subject makes for fascinating viewing, the road traveled is filled with lengthy scenes with languishing pacing, underdeveloped characters, and an overuse of voice-over narration to explain the plot rather than show the emotional anguish. The spectacle is visually supreme while the dialog has a heavy-handed message that never seem genuine. There is just too much proselytizing and arguing over the word of God that it becomes superficial debates and overshadows the characters who seem more plot devices than real people. There is nothing unique about the narrative. History has already proved that many have died under the guise of religion (and will continue to do so). The film is more sermon-like than it need be. Mr. Scorsese is literally preaching to the choir, with enough fire and brimstone to last seven Sundays.Mr. Garfield is compelling as Father Sebastian. His character is such a direct Christ figure in appearance and stance. Almost too saintly to be considered human, he becomes a superhero of God. Yet the actor gives a nuanced and multi-layered performance. Mr. Neeson, in a smaller role, brings some gravitas as well. But Mr. Driver, who is an interesting presence, has little screen time and simply disappears midway through the film, which is a misstep. More problematic however is some grave miscasting in two pivotal roles: Issey Ogata as the inquisitor supplies very little menace to his role and Yôsuke Kubozuka as the weak Kichijiro becomes a form of unintentional comic relief as written. The tragic tone of this character eludes him.Silence remains a strong and passionate work by Mr. Scorsese. It is a serious work of art with a Capital S (and add a Capital B for Boring). The film is in dire need of judicious editing and major rewrites. On one hand, it relentlessly rails against the Catholic Church and its teachings while showing a reverence to its own piety. The film avoids its own silent code and tends to shout its message. tends to shout its message. There's far too much sound and fury in this well-made film when a quiet noise would have been a more powerful statement about the persecution and tyranny that befell its believers. And, I must confess, the slow and laborious pacing of this film was a personal hell for this moviegoer. No matter how wonderful this film looks, and on that count it succeeds, the film ultimately left me praying for a swift conclusion. Silence is a major disappointment from a master filmmaker. Let us pray that his energy and vision comes to a better end in his next creative venture. Can I hear an amen to that?",Silence

61,JuguAbraham,A film that makes you want to read the Japanese novel on which the film is based,8,16 February 2017,"The more I reflect on it, the film is important for its subject (read ""the original Japanese novel""), but as cinema it is a recreation of sequences from other important films. This is Scorsese taking a leaf out of Tarantino, who was also a great cineaste.One aspect of the film that I was impressed with was the development character of the Japanese man who constantly betrays his family, priests and friends and yet seeks forgiveness from God.It is not great cinema--but it is a great subject, which could have been developed better. For instance, the Judas-equivalent in the film, betraying time and again and asking forgiveness each time--is a deep subject, which Scorsese merely treats as an appendage.After the movie ends, we are not any wiser of how much was history and how much was fiction. I salute the author Shusako Endo, just as with The Last Temptation of Christ, I salute Nikos Kazantzakis, rather than Scorsese.We cannot compare this film with Bergman's trilogy of Through the Glass Darkly, The Silence and Winter Light, because Bergman wrote the original scripts and never adapted books. Here, Jay Cocks and Scorsese were adapting Endo's novel.The more disturbing fact is that Endo is not a historian but a novelist. One wonders what Cocks and Scorsese added to Endo's tale.",Silence
62,bkrauser-81-311064,An Earnest Examination of Faith,8,3 January 2017,"Two priests, alike in their devotion for their former mentor, enter the country of Japan to find word of his fate. It is the 16th century and more than a decade has past since the Shimabara Rebellion which caused the Tokugawa Shogunate to actively suppress Catholicism across Japan. ""The moment you set foot in that country, you step into high danger,"" warns the priests' superior. ""You will be the last two priests to enter Japan. An army of two."" Thus Silence begins; our attention and in many ways our faith is carried through by the quest of the sincere but arrogant Rodrigues (Garfield) and the pragmatic and terse Garrpe (Driver).It is a well known fact in film circles that director Martin Scorsese is a devout Catholic whose faith at one point geared him towards joining the priesthood. You get a sense of that whenever Catholicism inserts itself into his work (as it often does). There are obvious tonal shifts which do a good job at paying proper respect to the divine without taking away from the story. At his most reverential however, such as in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), that tone greatly enriches the film as if shining a light on an ancient gold quilled manuscript or filtering a beam of sun between panes of stain glass windows.That constant reverence shows up here, though Silence wisely injects oceans of naturalistic beauty that at times feel more like parts of Kundun (1997) than, say, the catholic mass in Mean Streets (1973). Despite a change in setting, similar questions echo in the dark caverns, lush bamboo forests and Edo period fortresses of this film. Can you be forgiven selfish acts in the pursuit of selflessness? Why do bad things happen to good people? Is redemption achievable? - and probably most importantly, is anyone really up there? None of these questions are of course answered; how can they be, given the pain and suffering so many go through in the course of this film. Catholics, largely peasants and laymen are forced to blaspheme, are tortured and/or executed for the sake of preserving the foundations of Japanese sovereignty against what they see as European encroachment. In voice over, Rodrigues comments that he has never seen a race more devoted to the faith, - his reflections betray his own wavering devotion and can't help but feel incredibly naive in the face of Inquisitor Inoue's (Ogata) questions.It's no stretch to presume that silence is an important motif in the film. The lack of a film score and the story's inclusion of secret masses only cajoles the audience into listening intently for a lack of noise. What we hear instead are constant insertions of God's grace: the gentle breezes, the crashing of waves, the rustling of bushes and trees. Only once does the film go completely quiet. Only then does Scorsese, for the first time presume to know the judgment of God where before he has remained silent.The faithful and the faithless will no doubt see Silence in vastly different ways. As a lapsed Catholic myself, I can sit uncomfortably on the fence and see two camps forging a mutual appreciation for the film while taking potshots at its transgressions. One camp appreciates the religious seriousness and contemplation of Silence; a mode that only inhabits a mainstream Hollywood feature maybe once every decade. The other, more secular side gravitates towards the film as form. Those in the know will catch on to the channeling of Japanese greats such as Kenji Mizoguchi, Masaki Kobayashi and especially Akira Kurosawa.Yet what's sorely lacking from Silence is a sense of history. We get a very satisfying and granular peek onto one man's crisis of conscience but we get very little information on the social, political and economic forces that have shaped Rodrigues's harrowing story. As a vessel for proved colonization and cultural genocide, Catholicism, sadly only gets a third-act tongue lashing. Also, setting up Japan's aggressive period of isolation as an original sin of sorts, could have made for an interesting dimension. Alas that tact is ignored to make room for meditations on private vs. public faith. Also for a movie about Japan starring an almost exclusively Japanese cast, it's disheartening we're spending so much time with the only three white people on the islands.All in all, Silence stops just short of being a must-see cinematic experience. There's a lot to recommend here, and considering how much it gets right, I'd venture to say the movie might just transubstantiate for you. Scorsese has stated in the past that he's been interested in adapting this story to the screen for over a quarter century, but has never felt ready until now. Some people may think he finally came around to it after maturity in his faith. I'd venture to say it's penance for making The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).",Silence
63,denis888,"Very Unusual, Deep, Tragic, Albeir Rather Violent",8,26 May 2017,"Martin Scorcese is a tremendous filmmaker which he has proved time and again with numerous awesome movies such as Gangs Of New York or The Departed. When I was told he had made a film on Christian missionaries to Japan in the 17th century, I became highly suspicious - who of all the people, Mr Scorcese, the very man who made a highly insulting The Last Temtation Of Christ. I was very cautious when starting watching this epic movie. My impressions are very mixed. Let me touch upon certain pluses and minuses/ What was good - 1. Excellent casting - Neeson, Garfield and Driver are awesome from start to finish, they are impeccably excellent and very powerful in each scene they do. This is the 2nd Garfield's film connected with the issue of faith and he again shines brightly. I must also pay deep respect to Japanese actors Tadanobu Asano and Issey Ogata who did marvelous job. 2. The setting - filmed in Taiwan, but depicting Japan, the camera simply enjoys every single trait of gorgeous nature, deep and mighty, superb and awesome. 3. The plot - I was deeply moved by a very correct depiction of Christianity and the real, present, graphic suffering that believers had to endure. 4. The message is simple and yet powerful, too. Silent suffering is often equal to that vivid and loudWhat was bad: 1. The length. Unwielding 160 minutes are too much to swallow at one gulp. Too slow and too plodded. 2. Too graphic a violence.

(R)After receiving word that a priest (Neeson) living in Japan has renounced his faith following torture at the hands of authorities persecuting Christians, a pair of young Jesuit priests (Garfield, Driver) travel there to find him. Scorsese and Jay Cocks' adaptation of Shusaku Endo's book (previously filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) is an examination of the power of faith and the ""silence"" of God when one suffers and cannot hear or feel His/Her presence and compassion, reflective of the director's long-held struggle with his own religious ideals and beliefs. The film's deeply thoughtful austerity creates a hurtle to accepting its message--it unfolds too slowly once the priests' journey begins, and doesn't always fully engage once pivotal plot points arrive; the patient will be rewarded, however, by its lingering propositions. Vivid recreation of 17th century Japan is always gorgeous to look at (even at its most brutal); cut by Scorsese's long-time editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, but those pacing issues (and an overlong denouement) cannot be overlooked. Strong performances from most of the cast, especially Asano and Ogata.

This movie is an excellent human document about this by telling us the story of two missionaries who travel to Japan to search their mentor of whom there were no reliable news. There they must face the severe persecution of the authorities though at first many converted peasants help and hide them. That puts them into a lot of trouble and the story is admirably told in several very dramatic scenes, excellent images and extremely good performance of the actors.

67,Screen_Blitz,Harrowing and complex religious epic brands a superb cinematic work by Martin Scorcese,9,21 January 2017,"""Sometimes silence is the deadliest sound"" marks the uncompromising tagline of this religious epic directed by the hands of Hollywood mogul Martin Scorcese. This film is perceived as Scorcese's passion project, a cinematic translation of the acclaimed novel by Shusako Endo, which he's tried almost three decades trying to lift off the ground before finally landing it just in time for Oscar season. The historical epic paints a harrowing of the journey following Catholic priests venturing into a foreign country where spirituality comes at a great cost and religious rights are stripped away by the hands of tyrant individuals who spit in the face of religion. What Scorcese's long, complex testament comes down to is a harrowing and realistic tale that feels largely relevant to today's era, particularly when you examine the ongoing cultural conflicts erupting around the world as shown in the media. For many people, it hits awfully close to home. Set in the 17th century, this film follows Portuguese Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (played by Adam Driver) who are informed by Father Alessandro Valignano (played by Ciaran Hinds) of the news of Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) captured in Japan and denouncing his faith in a public. Out of curiosity to this rumor, Rodrigues and Garupe travel to Japan where they witness mass persecution against Christians at the hands of Inoue Masashige (played by Issey Ogata). In an efforts to locate Father Ferreira and propagate Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are placed in a harrowing battle of wills against the Japanese tyrant that will place their faith to a test.Although this doesn't mark Martin Scorcese's first time tackling on the topic of religion as his first adventure in this subject was 'The Last Temptation of Christ', this film does not draw a biblical portrait of the days of Jesus. Instead, it explores a powerful testament on how Christian missionaries have experienced challenges where their spirituality is battered and used as a weapon against them by nihilists who view religion as a philosophical hoax. And with an inspiring screenplay by co-written by Jay Cooks, stunning cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto (who's collaborated with Martin Scorcese for a second time following 'The Wolf of Wall Street') to capture the overwhelming atmosphere, and an overall enchanting direction; Scorcese paints an emotionally (and visually) arresting picture on two Catholic's priests' journey to spread of God while fighting against the mass persecution in a world where religion is outlawed and flushed from society. The story is very gut-wrenching and very complex, but also very slow. The plot moves in a leisurely pace that is enough to drive impatient viewers into utter boredom. But those who sustain their wills of sitting through the sluggish narrative are offered into a captivating story of pain, loss, hope, and redemption; and Martin Scorcese rarely pulls any punches when igniting the story is life. It is a depressing journey, but unfortunately it is still true to this day.Since his debut in the cinematic spotlight, Martin Scorcese never an immersive cast of widely acclaimed actors for granted. Stepping into the lead role of Father Rodrigues is Andrew Garfield. With his 'Spiderman' two years in the rearview mirror, Garfield has taken the advantage of the opportunities to explore more grounded roles outside the superhero genre as well as his acclaimed role in 'The Social Network'. Garfield plays the role of a determined Catholic priest who's forced to face the brooding reality of Japan in a society where Christianity is a contraband philosophical being. By the hands of a brutal Japanese authority officer, Rodrigues is trapped into a tense, psychological battle that challenges his spirituality and pits him with a tough decision between standing up for his beliefs and witnessing poor civilian followers being slaughtered, or shout against his faith to save their lives as well as his own. Similarly in Mel Gibson 'Hacksaw Ridge' in which he played another religiously-defined character, Garfield delivers a solid portrayal of this role. Although he evokes occasional hiccups in his Portuguese accent, it is difficult to deny the powerful gravitas he pours into the role. Adam Driver is also very stringent in his role as Rodrigues's accomplice as his Liam Neeson has the emotionally broken Father Ferreira who shares much less than a handful of screen time throughout the near three-hour run. Japanese actor Issey Ogata successfully unleashes a frightening, if somewhat humane portrayal as Inoue Masashige, the cruel mastermind behind the savagery against the Christian community.Silence is a harrowing and complex religious epic that marks an enthralling piece of cinematic work by Martin Scorcese in a departure from his typical violent mobster crime genre. Needless to say, this is not a film that is likely to convince those who are non-believers to convert to Christianity (or at least that is not Martin Scorcese is aiming for), it is a captivating picture that marks a good recommendation for both sides of the religious compass. In conclusion, it stands high as one of the best films of 2016.",Silence

69,pyrocitor,One small step for mankind,9,31 January 2017,"For the last Martin Scorsese cinematic outing, audiences were graced with a drooling Jonah Hill waggling rubber genitalia across the screen. If a more abrupt paradigm shift exists than Silence, Scorsese's solemn passion project exploring faith, suffering, and the ethics of martyrdom, I dare you to find it. Taking a fair share of cues from Ingmar Bergman, and with nary a jaunty rock tune in sight, Silence completes Scorsese's spirituality triptych (following Kundun and The Last Temptation of Christ) not with a roar, but an appropriately introspective whisper. The clue is in the title, and Scorsese's latest work, though imperfect, stands among his most raw, yearning, powerful, and gruesomely beautiful.Charting the tormented journey of two Jesuit missionaries in 17th century Japan in search of their disappeared, disgraced mentor, Silence plays somewhere between The Last Temptation of Christ and Apocalypse Now, but is somehow bleaker than both. Before Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe (Garfield and Driver) have even left their monastery for Japan, they are already scrutinized by Scorsese's penetrating high angle tracking shots, like a literal eye of God surveilling them forebodingly. Upon their arrival in Japan (which Scorsese cloaks in perennial stylized mists, a transparent visual metaphor for the ethical and spiritual cloudiness to follow), Rodrigues and Garupe are already immediately in jeopardy. They are found by a sect of closeted Japanese Christians who cling to worshipping them with an almost manic desperation, only to repeatedly watch these followers be gruesomely tortured to death by the Japanese authorities, too recalcitrant to apostatize (publicly renouncing their faith) in front of the helpless priests. Here, Scorsese establishes the film's core thematic tension: martyrdom aside, at what point are the benefits of spiritual dogmatism outweighed by the collateral suffering and deaths of those whose lives it is meant to save? The latter half of the film is devoted to interrogating (pun intended) this question in more solemn detail. It's a gruelling, but also distressingly timely watch, and Scorsese, while stopping short of the torture-porn extremes of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ, doesn't shirk on graphic imagery in detailing the agonizing torment individuals are willing to espouse and governments are willing to inflict in the name of religious dissonance. Navigating the tricky subject matter, Scorsese is (largely) careful to deconstruct his narrative's implicit colonialism, while (mostly) steering clear of its perilous potential for Orientalist othering. A more balanced take would linger less with Father Rodrigues' steadfast Christian conviction, and grant more of a voice to the Japanese Buddhists, to have their vehement rejection of external Christianity play with more context than outright tyranny (the fact that Buddhism is itself an import religion to Japan is a cruel irony the film leaves untouched). One fleeting sequence, where Scorsese's surrogate Pontius Pilate, the Japanese anti-Christian inquisitor (Issey Ogata, whose flamboyant preening is perfectly malevolent and curiously funny) rebuts why he avidly resists the encroaching Christianity in his land, is one of the film's most fascinating moments, temporarily playing the film more as debate and less as diatribe. Ultimately, Scorsese is less interested in the polemic of missionary politics and colonialism than Rodrigues' own spiritual journey, but there's still the lingering unease of the tale begetting a Letters to Iwo Jima style counterpoint to fully tell the story. Focalizing the story through Garfield's Father Rodrigues proves a risky endeavour, as his earnest-turned-agonizingly-unrequited prayer-narration initially grates to the point of prodding the patience of even the most faithful Scorsese devotees (a fact not helped by his ludicrously unconvincing Portuguese accent, though Driver fares little better, while Neeson is evidently disinterested in even attempting one). There are many moments when we yearn for the title to have been obeyed somewhat more literally, as Garfield's voice-over threatens to detract from the stunning Taipei scenery. Even with Scorsese's never-steadier directorial hand lending the film a lethal calm and perennial throb of threat, two and a half fairly plodding hours with an existential Garfield tests viewer bladder capacity to the utmost. Then, halfway through, Scorsese finally shows his hand with a cunning turning point: we finally realize Rodrigues' obsession with the spiritual glory of martyrdom isn't meant to play as sympathetic. Suddenly, images of the looming face of Christ he fixates upon begin to play as cruelly ironic, if not outright contemptible, just as his increasing refusal to apostatize plays as increasingly selfish in the face of the multitudes of Japanese devotees dying to protect him. It's a bold reversal, and only successful thanks to Garfield's fearlessly human performance. His willingness to fully embrace and embody Rodrigues' flaws allow him to glide effortlessly from his early chirpily boyish, but somewhat short-sighted devotion, to his later defeated, muted husk of a man with surprising subtlety and enigmatic dissociation. By flirting with being so inaccessible, Garfield crafts one of the most unexpectedly haunting performances of the year. Similarly, Adam Driver's cracking voice and emaciated body embody Garupe's misery and doubt with remarkably visceral power. As the resident Kurtz, Liam Neeson employs his hangdog face and gravelly, sonorous tones to project unfathomable depths of defeat and bitterness, all the more stirring when his tempting words of corruption begin to make increasing, tragic sense. Still, it's Yōsuke Kubozuka as the Gollum-like Kichijiro, Scorsese's most recent Judas surrogate, who delivers the most fascinating emotional arc. Guided by Kubozuka's petulant charisma, Kichijiro's perennial betrayals and repentances transition from numbingly tragic to slapstick humour and back again with alarming effortlessness, making him a pathetic but unforgettable creation.Beautiful, searing, and achingly soulful, Silence poses profound, challenging questions, while remaining frequently teasingly enigmatic about the answers. While not quite reaching the formal perfection and blistering resonance of many of Scorsese's earlier classics, as religious persecution continues to proliferate in the contemporary world, a film so fearlessly prescient should be considered troubling, but essential, unforgettable viewing. Just don't be surprised for the film's title to prove prophetic for the state of its audiences afterwards. -8.5/10",Silence
70,areatw,Well-crafted but painfully slow and long,6,9 February 2020,"'Silence' is exactly what you would expect from a Martin Scorsese film in that it is well-produced, written and shot with a strong storyline and engaging lead characters. There aren't many films that explore religion and faith as deeply as this one and there's no doubt that it is an intellectual, thought-provoking piece that Scorsese has created. It's also visually stunning - as a piece of filmmaking 'Silence' is difficult to fault.It is, however, very easy to fault as a piece of entertainment. For all its technical merit, the truth is that this is an overly long, tediously slow and largely dull film that the average viewer will struggle to sit through. The pacing does it no favours and the near three-hour running length is excessive to say the least. It could have been condensed to closer to the two-hour mark without losing much at all from the storyline.'Silence' is obviously more likely to appeal to those with religious/spiritual beliefs, and they would probably get a lot more out of this film than I did.

72,maurice_yacowar,In 15th Century Japan two Portuguese priests seek their apostate mentor,9,26 January 2017,"Silence opens and closes on the sound of crickets. That small sound connotes silence. You only hear crickets when there is no other sound, especially not the sound of man and his cities and his machines. In the silence from man we seek the presence of God.But there is only silence from God too. Father Rodriguez chafes at the silence of God. Without direct divine instruction man must determine — whether by logic or by faith or accident — what course of action God wants him to take. He and Father Garupe assume it's their mission from God to go into alien and antipathetic Japan to find their mentor, Father Ferrera. They seek to disprove the charge of his apostasy. Instead they end up validating it. Ferrera is the inadvertent cause of their mission. But he wilfully provides Rodriguez's salvation when he persuades him to join him, to perform the abandonment of Christianity and to embrace Buddhism. This gamble with their souls saves other Christians' lives. In contrast, Garupe risks his body to save other Christians' lives — and all are lost. Conclusion: the way to serve the silent invisible God is to serve humanity. Man is God's visible presence.When Ferrera and Rodriguez serve the fugitive Christian community they have (literally) unearthed in Japan, their function is restricted to ritual, confession and the promise of a paradisal afterlife. For these promises many are tortured, killed or at best driven into a life of terror. Kichijiro races between betrayals and confessions. The crazed animal outsider recalls the Mifune character in Kurosawa's The Seven Samurai. Here he represents the power and futility of the Confession. He earnestly needs it but continually relapses into sin. His subplot scores the shallowness of the religion of ritual. It validates Ferrera's and Rodriguez's priorities when they save Christians' lives by abandoning the performance of their faith. There are two key scenes of ambiguity. In one Rodriguez sees a vision of Jesus in the water and hears a voice advising his apostasy. Whether this is a mad hallucination (not without ample cause), the voice of God, the voice of Jesus, the voice of Ferrara — it doesn't matter. The point is he gets that radical urge, whether from within or without, and it prompts his proper service to man. In the last shot Rodriguez is discovered in his flaming coffin to clutch his little crucifix. Within the Buddhist funeral he clings to his Christian emblem and faith. He has been vigilant not to violate his apostasy, to the point of denying Kichijiro another absolution. But in his most secret corner he retains his abandoned faith.Incidentally, Ferrara bears the name of the count in Browning's My Last Duchess. In the poem Ferrara is a wealthy Italian Renaissance nobleman, cultured, sophisticated, aristocratic to a fault. The fault is standing on rank and privilege at the cost of feeling and humanity. He has his last duchess killed for not sufficiently respecting his status. Scorsese's Ferrera transcended his literary parallel by abandoning the letter of Christianity to serve humanity through Buddhism. Serving God through mankind is better than dis-serving humanity in the name of God. That gives this film significant contemporary relevance. Its sometimes gruesome assault on Christianity evokes the current slaughter of Christians throughout Muslim countries, especially in the Middle East, where only Israel provides Christians and their religion freedom and support. (Of course that doesn't deter several churches and many Christians from supporting Israel's genocidal enemies instead. But that's another movie.) The film's subject Christianity also has a broader reference. As the two heroic priests subordinate their faith to serve humanity, the Inquisitor becomes the villain for his fervour in abusing humanity to serve Buddhism. As we read today's headlines we find the film's theme and dynamic as pertinent to Islam as to Buddhism and Christianity. All religions are susceptible to abusing humanity in the name of their faith. Sad. But reformable?The opening scene, once the darkness of the crickets has cleared, reveals a steaming smoky landscape, hilly and arid, with pools of scalding water with which to torture the believers. The 15th Century Japan setting may seem a world away from the Mean Streets of Scorses's New York parables. But the theme is the same. Like the smoking dark streets that start Taxi Driver the landscape is an inferno in which man stumbles trying to find salvation amid the temptations of both life and faith — with nary a word from any God.",Silence

Scorsese is definitely one of the best filmmakers of the past and present, although I haven't been to impressed with his recent streak of films. With Silence, I was hoping for a special film that could rank among some of his best. Silence seemed to be that film that would be a cinematic and spiritual experience. It does not disappoint on that level. However, upon reflection I'm still a bit mixed on this film. In fact I'd say this will polarize the audience and that's probably what Scorsese had in mind.One thing I hope is that people aren't liking this movie because of the religious conflict. I think personal beliefs should be checked at the door when experiencing a film. If you go in with the mindset that this is sacrilegious to Christianity then you will have a biased view. Suspend your beliefs as they would say. I'd say Silence should be viewed in the theater or in the highest quality possible because some of the cinematography is beautiful. The oceans, plains, forest, clouds, pop out at you on the screen. Fog is seen often in the film and its great for suggesting a feeling of unease, anticipation, and even fear of the unknown. Scorsese's camera-work is always a joy to behold and it won't disappoint here. One of the most notable aspects of the film is the lack of non diegeitic music. There's a minimal use of a score, Its truly silence in that aspect. It lets you absorb the world of the film, its nature, and its surroundings.I've not always been sold on Andrew Garfield as a serious actor and I was scratching my head at him being the lead in this film. I'll have to say I have no complaints here. Once you get used to the accents you basically see him at his best performance yet. His character has to show a bit of range as the film progresses, and I thought he did it well. Garfield's Sebastião Rodrigues goes from cautiously optimistic to having a serious crisis of faith . A lot of the film is told from the perspective of his inner monologue which goes hand in hand to his state of mind as events transpire. I liked Adam Driver in this as well. The film could have used more of him.Now to get to my criticisms. Perhaps I got the wrong impression from the subject matter and the trailer but I was expecting more action/violence. This is definitely not that kind of film. Which is fine, however there are times where the film could have used more violence to build fear. What happens to Garfield and his Christian faithful is a scary thing (in a scary land) but sometimes there seems to be no urgency. I had problems with the pacing. This was not a film that flew by. At its near three hour length, you will feel the length. The first act is slow, second act picks up but then drops in the final act. The final minutes are fairly predictable and the method of telling the story at this point felt odd.We live in a pretty modern time but I could have seen this film being pretty controversial in an earlier decade (much like Scorsese's Last Temptation of Christ). The themes and messages would have driven a fair few into a minor fit. God is silent and remains silent, through your pain. Your unwavering dedication to God; what does it mean? What purpose does it serve? Is it more important than living? This was a passion project for Scorsese , which doesn't always mean its going to be fun at all times for us. I'd say this is a good film but I couldn't help but feel disappointed after expecting something of a masterclass from a fantastic filmmaker. By no means is it a bad film. I think I had problems with the delivery but the subject matter of the film is deep. I don't think its one of Scorsese's best; it wouldn't crack my top 5 of his filmography. If you are a fan of his work, I think you owe it to yourself to see it and form your own opinion about it. Just be prepared to invest your time into it. The film could yet be a grower and be something I love in a few weeks.7.75/10",Silence

76,RforFilm,"To watch Scorsese's Silence is to go through a tough, but beautiful exploration on spirituality",10,23 January 2017,"To quote the Bible from the book of Peter 5:10, ""And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm, and steadfast"". It may surprise you that acclaimed director Martin Scorsese wanted to become a priest before he settled on a filmmaking career. While that doesn't say much about him now, it does show that the church was a big part of his life as a youth and makes you wonder about how he sees the world. Martin Scorsese is the one filmmaker from the French New Wave era of movie makers who has managed to remain consistency great. Even his lesser work like Shutter Island is still a very good movie is the least. Scorsese has put his two cents in every genre from family (Hugo), to gangster (Goodfellas), to biopics (The Aviator, The Wolf of Wall Street) and many more. His most controversial film came in the 1980's when he made The Last Temptation of Christ, which was said to be his most personal (and is also a film I love). Silence is his next foray into religion and to holding onto ones belief. In the fifteenth century, jurist priests Sebastiāo Rodrigues (played by Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (played by Adam Driver) receive word that their mentor Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) has committed apostasy in Japan. Christianity has been outlawed in Japan and the Jurists have been trying to change that. Knowing their teacher wouldn't do such an atrocity, ask and get permission to go and find Ferreira. Once they are introduced to Kichijiro, a Japanese fisherman who claims to renounce Christianity, Rodrigues and Garupe are taken to Japan via boat. In several small villages, Rodrigues and Garupe see that the local Christian population has been driven underground, for the sentence is usually death. Both men ask, but few seem to know who Father Ferreira was. In the meantime, both priests do their best to help the Christians while remaining hidden from the Samurai army. At one point, Kichijiro betrays Rodrigues and has the priest captured. Rodrigues is told by ""the inquisitor"" that Japan has no use for the Catholic Doctrine and that Christian prisoners will continue to be tortured until he too commits apostasy. It is here where he faces a lot of questions about his faith, selflessness, and the nature of humanity.Silence is a movie that Scorsese has wanted to make for decades, and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. This is an example on how to make a great religious movie. Now only is it a story that is never boring, this truly pushes the audience as much as the priests are being pushed for their beliefs. It may be a long movie (nearly clocking in at three hours), it's all intentional for the benefit of feeling just as isolated as out main character.Coincidentally, this happens to be the second religious story for Andrew Garfield this year along with Hacksaw Ridge. However, this also proves that this young man may be one of the finest actors of our generation. All of his moments, from staring at himself in the water to his struggle to step on a Christian picture, all feel earned and never once feel phony. It is beautifully shot and edited as all Scorsese movies are. Something about Silence makes it's clearly large world feel so isolating. It really feels like that your going on a spiritual journey. How you come out in the end is up to you.I'll give this ten pictures of Saint Peter out of ten. Silence is a movie that while maybe not for everyone, is something that I implore every fan of film to check out, even if their not following a religion. This is more then holding onto spirituality; its about your principles and holding out for what you DO believe in. This'll probably be too polarizing for the award season, but this is a work of art that needs to be seen at least once (preferably on the big screen). Silence will hang above you like a cloud for a while like I expect it to do for me.",Silence
77,Anurag-Shetty,A thought provoking film.,8,18 February 2017,"Silence is a story adapted from the novel by Shusaku Endo, & is based on true events. Two Portuguese Jesuit priests named Rodrigues(Andrew Garfield) & Garupe(Adam Driver), find out that their mentor Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson), has gone missing in Japan. Father Rodrigues & Father Garupe travel to Japan to find Father Ferreira & promote Christianity in Japan. However, propagating Christianity was strictly forbidden in Japan. Silence is an excellent movie. Director Martin Scorsese has given us yet another unforgettable movie after, The Departed(2006), Shutter Island(2010), Hugo(2011) & The Wolf of Wall Street(2013). The script by Jay Cocks & Scorsese is engaging & has flawlessly adapted Shusaku Endo's source material for the big screen. The highlight of the film is the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. All the locales in the movie, look absolutely gorgeous. The lack of a background score, is a one of a kind effect, that works wonders. Not everyone will like this movie though. It moves along at a slow pace & the long run-time doesn't help either. There are also many scenes that are hard to watch & may make some viewers squeamish. The performances are another strong point of the film. Andrew Garfield is mind blowing as Rodrigues. Garfield portrays the various hardships his character goes through, effortlessly. Adam Driver is brilliant as Garupe. Liam Neeson is superb in his small yet significant role, as Ferreira. Tadanobu Asano is good as the Interpreter. Ciaran Hinds is effective as Father Valignano. Issei Ogata is awesome as Old Samurai/Inoue. Shin'ya Tsukamoto & Yoshi Oida are great as Mokichi & Ichizo, respectively. Yosuke Kubozuka is amazing as Kichijiro.

This is about two Portuguese Priests who volunteer to go to Japan in the 17th Century to find their missing mentor played by Liam Neeson. Once there they face religious persecution and extreme tests of faith and this is their story.Now that is it and this goes on for 161 minutes and I know I will be called a philistine etc for saying this but it is incredibly dull. I was brought up a Catholic and find all kinds of Missionary activity to be a form or cultural imperialism so did not care a jot what happened to these interlopers.

79,dave-mcclain,"""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message.",4,15 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese's historical drama ""Silence"" (R, 2:41) is set in a place, during a time and in a set of circumstances with which most 21st century westerners are unfamiliar, making it difficult for many Movie Fans to appreciate without a little background: From 1603 to 1867, Japan was ruled by a series of military dictators which held the title of shogun and were all from the Tokugawa clan. Early in the Tokugawa shogunate, Japan opened itself up to trade from Europe, which brought in new weaponry like the musket, and also led to the arrival of Christian missionaries. The shoguns soon began to feel that the spread of Christianity in Japan was a threat to their authority. By 1635, Japan passed a series of Seclusion Laws severely restricting trade and immigration. They also passed laws banning Christianity, which led to a Japanese inquisition to discover, torture and even kill practicing Japanese Christians.Based on the 1966 novel of the same name written by Japanese Catholic Shūsaku Endō (and made into feature films in 1971 and 1996), ""Silence"" is the story of three Portuguese Jesuit Catholic priests and their experiences in 17th century Japan. When Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a famous missionary to Japan, stops writing and is rumored to have publicly abandoned his faith, or apostatized, two of his students, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) volunteer to go to Japan to learn the truth, find Father Ferreira and, if necessary, save his soul.Rodrigues and Garupe get a drunken Japanese apostate named Kichijiro (Yōsuke Kubozuka) to help them sneak into Japan. The priests are enthusiastically greeted by Japanese peasants who had been earlier converted to Christianity, then driven underground by the Tokugawa shogunate's persecution. The villagers hide and protect the priests and the priests minister to the villagers by hearing their confessions and baptizing them. Word of the priests' presence soon spreads, which leads to increased demand for their services among the populace – and increased danger from the local Nagasaki-area Inquisitor who is also looking for the priests – and is willing to torture and kill in order to find them.The persecution of Japanese Christians takes a variety of forms as military and government officials try to stamp out the influence of the religion throughout the country. These officials often lay on the ground a stone carving representing Jesus on the cross and demand that accused Christians step on it as a way of denouncing the faith. Those who refuse are subjected to a variety of tortures, often ending in death, making many of them martyrs. As the local governor, Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata), explains, the Japanese have learned that it's more effective to get priests themselves to apostatize, so the officials use the lives of their own people as leverage to try to get the priests to comply. As the priests pray to God for help and wisdom, they become increasingly distressed that they're met mainly with silence.""Silence"" is an impressive historical epic which suffers from the lack of a clear message. As such movies often do, this one transports Movie Fans to a different time and place where we can learn a lot and be engaged by a little-known story. In this case, the story is true (with the priests based on actual historical figures, but with some details of their lives changed) and the acting is terrific, but the message is muddled. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, all I'll say is that both religious and non-religious Movie Fans will identify with some of the characters, but many will get to the closing credits wondering what the film was really about and what the point of watching it was. Beyond the quality of the filmmaking and the educational value of the movie, when it comes to singing its praises as an entertaining experience, all you'll hear from me is silence. ""C""",Silence
80,Danusha_Goska,What Was Scorcese Thinking?,1,17 January 2017,"There used to be 200,000 Christians in Japan. In the seventeenth century, the Buddhist shogunate decided to eliminate them. Christians were tortured, starved, crucified, and wiped out by the Buddhists. Thank heaven Buddhism is such a tolerant religion. Otherwise it would be terrible to think what might have happened. Martin Scorcese's film ""Silence"" depicts a slice of this history. Two priests, played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, travel to Japan seeking to learn the fate of their fellow priest, played by Liam Neeson. Japanese Christians rush to the priests, eager to receive the sacraments of communion and confession. The priests are set upon by Japanese Buddhists who starve and torture them. Occasionally there is some flapdoodle dialogue about whether or not Christianity belongs in Japan. You will receive no spiritual insights from this dialogue. It is lifeless and uninteresting. Ask any college sophomore to talk to you about Buddhism and Christianity and you will be more intrigued. The movie is very slow. Events are depicted almost in real time, with no editing. As one reviewer said, ""the movie starts in the 1500s and never ends."" The torture is graphic and grotesque. There are decapitations, crucifixions, and drownings. The ending won't surprise anyone. The priests have no power. They are surrounded by people who are not only eager to torture them, but also to torture other people. The Buddhists tell the Christians, ""We will only stop torturing these innocent Japanese people if you renounce Jesus."" What on earth was Martin Scorcese thinking? What is the point of this movie? Is Scorcese trying to get us to renounce something? The film sure feels like torture. The movie questions whether or not Christianity ""belongs"" in Japan. It implies that Christianity does not belong in Japan. Here's the thing – people are being tortured. Under torture you'll say whatever the torturer wants you to say. You'll say that Trump won the popular vote. With the threat of torture hanging over the head of every character in the film, the debate is rather skewed. Even as he appears to be belittling Christianity as an imperialist, colonizer's religion, Japanese Buddhism doesn't come off any better. The film consists of one scene after another of Japanese Buddhists torturing innocent people, coldly and gleefully. Not a great advertisement for Buddhism. Buddhism was also used by Imperial Japan during WW II. It's time we take a serious look at how Buddhism has been exploited to condone evil.",Silence
81,swilliky,An extraordinary Scorsese film on faith and culture,8,27 January 2017,Martin Scorsese has made a powerful film about the power of faith and the struggle between conflicting cultures. This epic story tells of the journey of two priests who come to Japan to find their lost teacher. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) are the two young priests that venture to hostel Japan. They have received news that their teacher Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has apostatized against the Christian faith. They do not believe the rumors and determine that they will travel to Japan to retrieve their father and discover the truth while spreading the gospel.The brutal torture of Japanese Christians is revealed early and continues throughout the film making this a movie that could be difficult to watch for some. The Inquisitor (Issei Ogata) persecutes the faithful with elaborate tactics that conspire to bring out the worst in humans. They provide religious tests like stepping on an image of Christ or spitting on a cross to weed out the Christians. They put the citizens to death making the priests doubt their mission and put out a bounty for the priests' capture. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com,Silence

83,bryank-04844,'Silence is Golden'!,8,23 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese certainly has had a fantastic career in film. From films like 'Raging Bull' to 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino', to 'Taxi Driver', 'The Departed', and the recent 'Wolf of Wall Street' – it's easy to say that Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers still out there today. Scorsese may be know for a lot of gangster and super violent films over his career, but he has made a variety of other movies in different genres, including the recent kid's film 'Hugo'. He is also a big supporter in world cinema, making it easier for people around the world to experience new filmmakers from other countries. One genre Scorsese is fairly into is the religion genre.Back in 1988, Scorsese made 'The Last Temptation of Christ', which won some awards and went on to be one of the most talked about movie of its time. Fast forward to present day and we have a brand new religious film from Scorsese called 'Silence', based on the 1966 novel of the same name. This film is set in 17th century Japan where two Jesuit Portuguese priests travel to Japan in order to look for their missing fellow priest, who hasn't been heard of in some time. This is cause for great concern, because Japan at the time, was against Christianity, and would kill people violently if they believed in the Christian God. Scorsese's films usually clock in at around the three hour mark. With 'Silence' is is about twenty minutes shy of that three hour milestone, but don't be fooled by the short time stamp.This is a very slow burn film, which takes its time going places. That's not to say that's a bad thing, but it's not as fast paced as let's say 'Wolf of Wall Street'. Scorsese has perfectly crafted a historical drama that captures every essence of the time period and location, as well as, having a strong message without being at all preachy or conforming to one religion, which is always most welcome. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver play both Jesuit priests named Rodrigues and Garrpe respectively, as they trek to Japan secretly to find their mentor Ferreira played by Liam Neeson. Rodrigues and Garrpe must literally hide from everyone, with the exception of the very poor villagers who consider themselves Christians and hide them in a small hut.Over time, both priests have to begin their search again for their missing fellow priest, but are captured and are mentally and physically tortured. Their captors aren't all that bad in a sense, as they try to make Rodrigues understand where they are coming from, while trying to understand him. They stick by their word in that if the Christian believers just step on a stone that depicts their God, they can go free, but that isn't always the case. Rodrigues is the focal point of the story here too as his faith is always tested in many different ways, until he realizes that he can still believe in something without shouting it to the world.Neeson and Driver are excellent in their roles, but don't have a lot of screen time, specifically Neeson. It's a wonder he is top billed at all. Garfield is excellent here. His emotions are raw and true, however his Portuguese accent comes and goes throughout the movie. Scorsese framed this film perfectly as every shot looks beautiful and amazing, even with scenes that involve death. 'Silence' for sure is a slow paced and long film, but the journey to the end is very rewarding, making this Scorsese film one to be remembered and proving at the age of 74, he can still put out amazing films and art that means something.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",Silence

85,tonypeacock-1,A tough watch. A really tough watch.,5,4 February 2021,"Very hard work is how I would summarise this film. Yet another epic from director Martin Scorsese starring Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver.Basically the film has a seventeenth century setting in Japan where Christianity is outlawed and a Catholic Priest (Ferreira) tries to spread the faith in the country.When he goes missing two of his Portugese students Rodrigues (Garfield) and Garrpe (Driver) make the journey to try and find him and spread the Catholic faith.Perhaps it's my atheist belief that made the subject matter very hard work at times. I was just profoundly bored despite my best efforts to keep with the film. Which I did.Scorsese films are known for there long running times and Silence is no different. I think a good half an hour could quite easily have been edited from the running time.The cinematography is good. The foggy environment at the beginning to the sunny Japanese environment.I don't really know Garfield or Driver. Garfield especially puts in a shift. Neeson appears to die after 5 minutes (bringing back memories of his fleeting appearance in Gangs Of New York) however he reappears towards the end.Serious critics have given this film a respectable rating but it just didn't hit the right notes for me. Disappointing.",Silence
86,jdkraus,A powerful meditation on faith and the human spirit,9,21 January 2017,"The year is 1640. The Catholic Church has spread all over the world, yet one nation has been labeled a danger. That is Japan. Two Jesuit Priests, Father Rodriguez (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) receive word that their former master Ferrerira (Liam Neeson) has apostatized. Believing this a lie, the two priests embark on a journey to the foreign land, hoping to discover the truth of their teacher. The Priests' quest proves more burdensome than they had expected, putting their lives in danger and faith to the test.Dubbed as his passion project, Scorsese explores many deep, philosophical questions in Silence. Is there a God? If so, why does he permit so much suffering? Is it mere arrogance and selfishness to hold onto one's faith at the expense of other people's lives? There is much to meditate and reflect upon in this film. At times, Silence is very hard to watch. While not particularly bloody, unlike some of Scorsese's other movies, the brutal acts depicted feel very real.Aside from the controversial subject matter, ""Silence"" is an excellent character study on Father Rodriguez and Garupe. We get to see how they change and ultimately follow two different paths. Andrew Garfield turns in his best work as Father Rodriguez. Adam Driver is equally brilliant. Liam Neeson has minimal screen time, but delivers one of his finest performances. He can convey so much emotion without speaking. There is more to his acting capability than Bryan Mills from Taken. Isse Ogata is evil and manipulative as the Japanese Inquisitor. He can be charming one moment and vile the next, a sort of Doctor Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona. The rest of the supporting cast are also great in their respective roles.Like most other movies by Scorsese, the production values are top-notched. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is simply stunning. Each shot is a work of exceptional art, whether it is a close-up on an actor's face or a beautiful landscape image. Prieto has a phenomenal eye for composition and lighting, proving himself as one of Hollywood's best DP's. The production and costume designs are exquisite, capturing a lost era. The make-up design accommodates the ugliness and lack of personal hygiene people had centuries ago. We don't see actors with pearly white teeth or unblemished skin. The use of sound or rather lack thereof is particularly unique. There are moments where it is completely silent. The visuals take priority, allowing the audience a chance to absorb the character's emotions. This technique works very well. The fact Silence does not have a music soundtrack makes it even powerful. So many films rely on music to convey an emotional response in the viewer. The visuals, performances, and story do this for the movie. The only criticism I have is the pace. The first two hours move steadily but the ending drags a bit. It is almost as if the screenwriters wanted to add more to the story than it needed. In my opinion, a shorter ending would have given the film a much stronger resolution. With such a huge filmmaking career that Scorsese has developed over the years, it is hard for me to rank this as one of his best. He has made so many excellent movies. Silence is a great one. That's for sure – one of 2016's best.",Silence
87,DarthVoorhees,A deep personal Scorcese epic,9,14 April 2017,"In a lot of ways 'Silence' is the most somber and personal Scorcese film. It is a story tailor made for Scorcese as his films often explore Catholicism and catholic guilt in particular. I wonder though if 'Silence' is a work of literature that lends it's self well to film adaptation. It too is a personal work which challenges the reader to reflect. Much of it is told from the perspective of it's lead character Francisco. And the success or lack thereof will depend on how you feel about Andrew Garfield.Martin Scorcese. took a big gamble in giving Andrew Garfield the lead role (personally I would have swapped Garfield and Driver) but for the most part he is able to handle the role. This is an actor who is still evolving his craft and although he is talented I think he lacks the subtlety needed for 'Silence' I think a reason 'Silence' took so long to get to the screen is that Shusaku Endo's novel is written almost entirely in self reflection and monologue. The translation to film is a bit choppy and you really needed Garfield to step up. He is more than capable before the film enters the central conflict. He has warmth when the characters faith has not been tested and when he is a priest spreading the gospel. His performance in the film begins to suffer at the point where Francisco feels his faith tested.The one addition that I did not care for is during the ending the silence is broken at least from the audience's perspective. Scorcese inserts narrations presumably from Christ himself. It has been a while since I read the novel but I was under the impression that this was far more vague as to whether this was a real miracle or not. I was always under the impression that Endo was challenging the reader and Francisco to have faith.On a personal note, I initially read the novel when I heard about Scorcese tackling the film nearly ten years ago. I read it at an interesting time when I was losing my own faith in God and the Catholic Church that I was raised in. I admired it because it is a novel that reflects on the best and worst of Catholicism. The film is good but I think I came in with my preconceptions clouding my judgment. 'Silence' is a remarkable achievement as we should expect from Scorcese. I think Endo's literary achievement is far greater though.",Silence
88,brankovranjkovic,Silence - An Epic Three Hour Test of Faith,8,8 January 2017,"A three hour epic from Martin Scorsese, starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson. The film is set in 17th century Japan where Christianity is outlawed and Liam Neeson's character is a priest, preaching the Catholic faith. The film starts with Liam Neesan's character, witnessing scenes of local Christian people suffering graphic torture, these scenes are typical Scorseses and difficult to watch. We appreciate that Liam Neeson's character is already struggling with his conscience and his faith.When he goes missing two of his Portugese students, Garfield and Driver travel to Japan in search of him and also to continue preaching. On arriving Garfield and Driver must denounce Christianity and must conduct Mass in secret, at night. Their Apostasy is demonstrated by stepping onto a tile with the imprint of Christ, easier for Garfield than Driver, they both refuse spitting on a cross. These characters engage in long periods of dialogue and this gives them a Shakespearian feel, both characters are particularly well developed and convincing.Towards the end of the film we learn that Liam Neesan's character is still alive, he has denounced Christianity, studied at a Buddhist temple and became a Buddhist priest. We also learn that he has taken the identity of a dead local man and taken on his wife and son. The film is almost three hours long but in my opinion didn't feel overly long, a film you need to watch, concentrate, absorb, question the decisions made and consider how far you would allow yourself be responsible for the suffering of others when the suffering is done to force you to denounce your faith?",Silence
89,anselmdaniel,Thoughtful movie,8,18 July 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Silence is directed by Martin Scorcese and stars Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. The movie follows two Portuguese priests in search of their mentor in Japan. Their once respected mentor has rejected the Catholic faith and is now living with a Japanese identity. The two priests travel to Japan to find the hidden Christians and must come to terms with their faith.As a non-religious person, I found Silence to be incredibly thought provoking. The movie grapples with the heavy theme of faith. The movie centers heavily around Andre Garfield's character. He begins the movie realizing his mentor, played by Liam Neeson, has rejected Catholicism and assumed a Japanese identity. It is here that the movie begins the test of faith. Throughout the movie, Catholicism is called into question on Japan. The peasants have their own interpretation of the faith, and ultimately must apostatize in order to save their lives. Those that do renounce the faith may still cling to it in their hearts. The movie asks the question is one still a believer even after forcibly renouncing their faith? It is this question that persists throughout the movie. All of the characters that play a major role are pivotal to this theme. Two of the important scenes comes with the debate with the grand inquisitor and the former mentor. The discussion with the grand inquisitor was an interesting perspective on how both of the characters viewed Christianity. The re-connection with the mentor forced the character to see how Christianity is really treated in Japan by the hidden devout. It forces the viewer and the character to come to terms with how radical the interpretations became with the Japanese peasants' interpretations. It also showed that certain concepts would not work in Japan and how the inquisitor may have been right.Aside from the plot and themes, the directing, editing, acting, and cinematography are all top notch in this movie. This is a gorgeous movie that shows the time and effort that Martin Scorcese put. Andrew Garfield deserves much praise for his fantastic portrayal of Father Sebastian Rodrigues. The Japanese actors do a great job with their foreign accent. The movie shows the age and time period of the movie incredibly well with sets and costumes that appear authentic to the period. The only downside to this movie is perhaps its length. For some audiences, the movie could be repeating the points too much and it can be a slow beginning.Overall I would recommend Silence to any audience member that is a fan of Martin Scorcese or a fan of the themes of faith. The movie took much care to show the struggles of faith in the face of oppression.Grade: A",Silence
90,MrDHWong,A fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director,8,15 March 2017,"Silence is a drama film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson. Based on the book of the same name, it is a fascinating and thought-provoking piece of cinema from the veteran director.In 1640, two Portuguese priests, Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) travel to Japan to recover their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has been missing for sometime and is rumoured to have committed apostasy. Upon sneaking into Japan, where Christianity is strictly outlawed, the two priests attempt to preach Catholicism to some small villages, all while avoiding detection from local samurais.Whether one is deeply religious or not, this film leaves a lasting impression and will likely cause one to question their personal beliefs. I particularly liked the nice blend of Eastern and Western influences throughout the story, which adds to its intriguing tone. The Eastern parts seem reminiscent of director Akira Kurosawa's work and the Western parts feel like classic Hollywood. Despite its 161 minute running time, the film never feels boring or slow, mainly due to Scorsese's clever directorial techniques. This has been a passion project for the acclaimed director over the past 25 years and certainly shows. One can't help but notice the care and attention to detail he put into making this film.I rate it 8/10",Silence
91,CANpatbuck3664,Silence is Well Manufactured but Lacks a Sympathetic Hero or a Decent Message,5,4 April 2017,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* A letter has gotten back to Father Valignano (Ciaran Hinds) at his church in Portugal. The year is 1637 and it is regarding the whereabouts of famed Jesuit Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). He had been sent to Japan to spread the gospel but he had to witness the followers of Christianity being tortured by the leaders of Feudal Japan. They will not allow their citizens to follow any other religion other than Buddhism. Japan wants nothing to do with Christianity or the influence of Europe and is willing to go to great lengths to discourage it. It is rumoured that to avoid torture, Father Ferreira has apostatized and given up on the Roman Catholic faith. His pupils Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garupe (Adam Driver) refuse to believe this. He was their teacher and they insist that this letter is rumour. Valignano insists it is the truth but they arrive at an impasse. Rodrigues and Garupe volunteer to go to Japan to find Ferreira and prove this letter false while spreading the gospel. Valignano reluctantly agrees and points them in the direction of someone who can help smuggle them into Japan.I may not be gushing over this movie but that doesn't mean I don't respect that its put together by one of the best directors working today. The cinematography is really striking and they really take advantage of the scenery in Taiwan. As much as I had a hard time attaching myself to Father Rodrigues or Father Garupe, it was hard not be at least interested in where they would go next.I'm sure that actors would fight for the chance to work with Martin so I'm not surprised that this movie attracted some top shelf talent. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are both on the rise and both are grabbing top level projects. I thought they both did a fine job, they put their all into this and while I found their characters to by too self righteous to like, it wasn't their fault. Liam Neeson is in the movie far less than I expected him to be but he also does well in the time he's given. Several of the Japanese actors give exemplary performances including: Yôsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro, Tadanobu Asano as the Interpreter and Issei Ogata as the Inquisitor. The whole cast does a good job and I didn't find a weak performance in the group. Garfield and Driver's accents are a little weird but that didn't limit my enjoyment of the movie.I also respect this movie for asking the big questions. They really look at both sides of how the Japanese Christians and their Portuguese priests suffer for their faith and how God is seemingly indifferent or ""silent"" in the face of their pain. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought about these things and it has the makings of a spirited debate about God's role in how humanity operates. By the time you reach the end of the movie though, you don't really end up with a clear answer. I understood what the ending meant but the overall arc of the movie is muddled in a mixed message. Is it trying to make a statement about having faith through tough times? The movie has been called both anti-Christian and reaffirming for Christianity so I don't know if there is an actual consensus on where the movie falls on the debate.From what I've heard this book is notorious for being difficult to read and I can see why. The problem with this is that the movie seems like one long montage of these poor people dying while those who are responsible for them are just letting them happen. I got why Rodrigues and Garupe felt why they did but their actions left me furious. I found myself largely on Ferreira's side where their collective pride and their stubbornness left me furious. Letting these people suffer for their pride, how is that noble or righteous? Then when Rodrigues really has to face the consequences for his actions, he gets bailed out by a deus ex machina twist in the plot. It felt like a cop out to me and it took any hope of an interesting resolution away from the ending.This movie just wasn't for me, it wasn't offensively bad but it was far from enjoyable. So much of the movie seems just about the violence and the torture, it was just painful to watch and eventually just annoying. This is a deep story but the message that Scorsese and his crew were trying to get across didn't translate for me. Garfield, Driver and Neeson all perform admirably but I thought they were sunk by their characters and the heavy subject matter. Maybe Silence just wasn't for me but I can't see this being accessible to the mainstream audience. I would recommend against seeing this unless your a huge Scorsese fan or devoutly religious.",Silence
92,nicholls_les,Dull and One sided,2,18 November 2019,"I watched this and kept hoping it would actually start. It was so dull and boring with over long scenes that led nowhere.
But the worst thing about this movie was the one sided portrayal of traditional Japanese culture and religion. The series Shogun was much better and showed the Japanese and explained the reasons they behaved the way they did and what seemed like their incomprehensible acts of evil to those in the west.",Silence
93,ronakkotian,Speechless...,9,6 June 2020,"What can I say about Martin Scorsese that hasn't already been said. He is an astounding director who's explored many different genres of film but Silence unveiled a side of Scorsese which I haven't seen.Silence tells the story of two Portuguese priests who travel to Japan in search of their mentor, who has been said to have apostatised the Christian faith, as well as spread Christianity to the residents of Japan.This film conveyed to me the diversity of Scorsese's skills as a director. A lot of his previous films arefast paced and made to entertain the audience. Silence separates itself from that body of work due to its much slower pacing and intense atmosphere which general audience won't enjoy. It's inevitable for some people to feel bored throughout. This is a movie that isn't made for a high box office collection but rather to respect cinema as an art form.Silence is a journey. An emotionally intense journey that studies humanity and religion as a whole. We see our main character Rodrigues, played by Andrew Garfield, go through a huge amount of turmoil as he becomes a man who believed in his faith as strongly as possible to someone who's completely broken and torn about his beliefs. This is possibly Scorsese's best looking film. The lighting, camerawork is absolutely sublime. Rodrigo Prieto did the cinematography for this film as well Scorsese's other films like The Wolf of Wall Street. He did an unbelievable job here. The writing by Jay Cocks and Martin Scorsese is brilliant and captures the 17th Century time period really well.Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver are superb here. Whilst Driver isn't as prominent in this film as Garfield, he still makes a huge impression overall. Words cannot describe how good Garfield is here. After seeing him in The Social Network and Under the Silver Lake, this adds to his collection of brilliant performances. Liam Neeson isn't in the film much but he's still good for the time he's on-screen. The Japanese cast are all spectacular and bring a great amount of authenticity overall.Silence is another example of Scorsese's talent. This is an emotionally draining film filled with many scenes that can be difficult to watch. I do wish the pacing was better during the first act as it wasn't as engaging compared to the other two acts but Silence overall is an encapsulating experience that will you speechless.",Silence
94,davidgee,Challenging start to the year's movie-going,7,7 January 2017,"My first movie of 2017 is a fairly challenging one – Martin Scorcese's 'treatise' on Faith and Apostasy in 17th-century Japan. Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver play two Portuguese priests who travel to the Orient to look for a missing predecessor (Liam Neeson) and to bring comfort and sacramental rites to Catholic converts who are being persecuted and tortured by Samurai inquisitors.Interesting to discover that Buddhism, which most of us think of as a pacifist, contemplative religion, has a history as dark and violent as that of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The silence at the heart of the movie is the silence of God: does He hear the prayers of the persecuted; and does He mind if people stamp on an image of Christ to save their lives?Apart from the harrowing scenes of torture and brutal execution, much of the film is shot in darkened rooms and daytime fogs. There are many long scenes – too many, too long – of dialogue between Garfield and the Inquisitor. There are a couple of clunky moments which attempt to echo Christ's Passion, and a Japanese 'Judas' pops into the story a little too often. Garfield gives a performance that reminded me of Montgomery Clift – that sense of tension waiting to be uncoiled. Driver's role is more physical, more heroic, less subtle. Liam Neeson relies too much on the gravitas of his presence. The last chapter in the story undermines much of the film's intensity and the final frame feels like something added as a 'sop' to today's evangelists.Inevitably you find yourself comparing SILENCE to Roland Joffe's 1986 epic THE MISSION. Scorcese's movie arguably has more depth and definitely more debate, but THE MISSION had a 'magnificence' which SILENCE has less of – and Joffe's movie had that resonating Morricone score. SILENCE deserves points for nobility of purpose and Mr Scorcese is clearly a man of huge integrity,",Silence
95,PyroSikTh,Three Hours of People Suffering in the Name of Faith,7,7 January 2017,"Silence follows two Jesuit priests in Japan; the last Jesuit priests, since the others have either been pushed out or executed. They find themselves in remote villages desperate for Christian guidance, but must spend their days hidden or otherwise risk being seen by the Inquisitor's men (or sold out to them), while they preach and hold mass at night. Once a visit from the Inquisitor spooks the villagers, the priests are separated and sent away. Rodrigues is of course captured by the Inquisitor and endures gruelling trials and torture to push him to apostatise. In a way, Silence is Scorsese's Passion of the Christ (more so than Last Temptation), as the characters are put through hell in the name of their faith. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer. Silence is not an easy film to watch. If watching all these people suffering does anything though, it shows the power of faith, and how people cling to their beliefs to the bitter end, willing to endure whatever it takes in the name of what they believe. In this regard, Silence is exquisite food for thought. It highlights both the strengths and weaknesses to religion, and portrays it's different followers. It looks at the power of symbolism, while simultaneously looking at the corruption of idolism. The last remaining Japanese Christians are so desperate for validation from their God that they worship religious imagery at the risk of pain and death. One of the key ways the Inquisitor uses to root out Christians is by getting them to disrespect the imagery they idolise. Because they hold the power of the imagery so high, they refuse, and are subsequently tortured and put to death. However there is one glaring problem with Silence. At nearly three hours, it's long. This is a really long, dirge of a movie that goes on and on and on. It takes some interesting turns here and there, and the length is good to really drive home the struggle Rodrigues has to endure, but it makes it an unpleasurable watch. It's hard work, and unlikely to be a movie I will ever re-watch. It particularly drags on too long in each of it's two main settings; in the remote villages, and in the Nagasaki cells. I definitely feel a lot could have been trimmed off from these two acts. There were too many scenes in the villages, and Kichijiro's neighbouring village was largely unnecessary. The scenes in the Nagasaki cells could have benefited from being montaged. For instance, there's a scene where Rodrigues watches five Christians be tested by putting their foot on an image of Christ. Rather than condensing this, we see each of the five come up to the plate, refuse, and get sent back, one-by-one. What could've been summed up in thirty seconds takes nearly ten minutes.Of course being a film titled Silence, it would seem a bit weird not to mention the sound, which is again used really well. The film's score is made up predominantly of ambiance and natural sounds, such as the chirping of insects at dusk. The use of sound effects is really evocative in creating moods and guiding the narrative without the use of too much actual music. For instance, the screams of agony endured by prisoners in Nagasaki are blood-curdling, while Mokichi's hymn with his last breaths is filled with emotion. Then of course there's the use of silence itself, particularly at the film's climax. It's enough to make you sit up and pay attention (which for this film is important to have). Finally the acting is strong from almost everyone. Andrew Garfield carries the movie expertly and without ever wavering. His Portuguese accent slips every now and then, but not enough to be particularly noticeable. He deserves praise for living the suffering and really encapsulating the blind devotion of Rodrigues in spite of the pain he and others around him endure. Adam Driver is pretty good as his companion, fellow Jesuit priest Garrpe, who grows impatient with the locals and their misunderstanding of the Catholic faith. Liam Neeson doesn't appear all too often, but balances the mentor act he does so well with a more subdued and downtrodden performance, showing the suffering he has also endured and the psychological marks that leaves. The Japanese actors were all quite admirable too, particularly Tadanobu Asano as Rodrigues' interpreter, Yôsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro, and Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. Although I must say I found Issei Ogata's Inquisitor a bit hammed up for my liking. I just couldn't take him seriously, undermining any sense of threat his character was meant to embody.In closing, Silence is not a movie you can enjoy. It's nearly three hours of watching people suffer and be tortured, and there's no real light at the end of the tunnel. It poses some interesting discussion points on the nature of faith and religious symbolism, but drags on too long and spends too much time hammering it's points. It's a very well made movie, with an interesting story, if imperfectly told, driven by captivating performances both Western and Eastern. However, if you have a vendetta against religion, or Christianity in particular, Silence is not the movie for you. I had two blokes behind me who scoffed any time anything remotely Christian was mentioned, who obviously had a bias against the story that was being told, and eventually walked out forty-five minutes in (and the screening was all the better without their obnoxiously loud talking as well). I give Silence an imperfect 7/10, and would recommend it for Christians and anyone with an open mind.",Silence
96,ClaytonDavis,'Silence' Flourishes With Respect and Martin Scorsese's Ultimate Legacy,10,19 February 2017,"Martin Scorsese has been a master of his craft for decades. It's hard not to consider him our single finest director working today. With films like ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" and now his newest endeavor ""Silence,"" we must now relish with the fact that we are witnessing a grand master of sorts working right in front of our eyes. History has remembered ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Vertigo."" These were two films not wholeheartedly recognized as masterpieces of their time. History now, however, will remember ""Silence,"" a marvelous and inspiring cinematic experience not to be forgotten.""Silence"" tells the story of two Jesuit priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver), who in the seventeenth century, face violence and persecution when they travel to Japan to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson), and propagate Catholicism.""Silence"" is Scorsese's most personal and beautiful film of his modern career. Labeling it just a ""passion project"" does it no justice. It has etched out a new avenue in which we can explore film forever. He has explored some of the most enigmatic themes in film, whether it be about revenge, family or a general exercise to push the boundaries of the medium.With ""Silence,"" he writes his most heartaching letter yet. There are filmmakers who are quickly trapped into the corner of ""indulgence"" when taking on a production this personal to them. Scorsese gets into the trenches of the story, mysteriously performing his own deconstruction of his faith and what it has meant to him. You can't ask a director to be more involved in the house of his film. He builds the foundation, drawing from the soul of his spiritual ancestors, and gives them his most devoted respect. Scorsese gives the viewer the weight of the message and lets it rest upon us. We are desperately and quietly screaming for justice, in a land that isn't allowing such things. Simply put, it's awe-inspiring.Andrew Garfield is divinely spectacular. With a year that has included another strong turn in ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" Garfield has shown himself to be one of the next generation's most gifted thespians. Adam Driver's vulnerability has never been matched in all his previous roles. He becomes the audience's spokesperson of doubt and logic, as Scorsese and writer Jay Cocks make him our voice of reason in a rich and layered dynamic.Issey Ogata is one of the year's vivid findings. Acting as the ""Hans Landa"" of Catholic persecution, Ogata's Inquisitor Inoue nearly reinvents the spiritual nature of the film, stealing every scene he shares with another actor. It's been 32 years since Haing S. Ngor won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for ""The Killing Fields"" and it's about time the Academy rewards a deserving Asian actor. With Ogata, a new Supporting Actor contender has emerged. Liam Neeson's work, though integral to the story, is a bit too brief to make a lasting impact.It's easy to write ""masterpiece"" for a film, and let it be generally understood by the casual movie-goer that reads it. The word left by itself doesn't fully explain the film's technical mastery. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto and Thelma Schoonmaker are masters of their crafts. Prieto frames the film to utter perfection, utilizing fog and blue-grey hues to capture the film's undying message of faith. Schoonmaker lets the story evolve into a construction of time, allowing the viewer to feel the ""weight"" of the ""waiting.""""Silence"" is epic, poignant and inventive. It must be said: As someone who was raised Catholic, used to be a high school religion teacher, and had his own personal qualms with his Lord and Savior, ""Silence"" spoke to me in a way I was not anticipating. I do recognize that there could be a large portion of the world, especially those who don't have strong feelings about any Christian religion, that may not be fully invested in the weight of its message. Scorsese set out to make a film about the ecstasy of one's own faith.How much do you value it? Why are there others so thirsty and hungry for its divine meanings and teachings? These are just two of many questions that the film dares to ask, and you really don't get the clear answer you may be searching for. For a select group, it could infuriate you, for others, it was just the tip of the iceberg of the glacier that lies beneath.The language of cinema is universal. The frames tell everything you need it to. Without words, a single image can change the world. What if ""Silence"" was a silent film? What would that have offered in its quest for answers? It's remarkably creative, and on the surface, you can say it's repetitive in what it displays to the viewer. The continuous striking of faith beats you down, submitting to the film's own moral compass, and developing a new wave of art that we have only dreamed.""Silence"" is imperative to our landscape. It is the crown jewel of Martin Scorsese's modern career, and in time, could be the defining film that history will use to represent him – his magnum opus.Grade: (★★★★)",Silence
97,JakeBrinkman,"Excellent right up to, but not including, the end",7,2 January 2019,"This tale of early Christianity in Japan is heartwrenching. Garfield's character is extremely relatable, and his performance is quite moving. My only complaint is with the ending, which I wish showed an inspiring level of willpower, a less ambiguous subversion, or at least a less drawn-out ending. As it stands, the ending is so lengthy that you begin to question the meaning of the final scene, even though that scene is supposed to be unambiguous.I would highly recommend this film to any Catholic.",Silence
98,Offworld_Colony,"Powerful, neither too obscure as not to be accessible and neither too obvious as to not be lyrical.",7,10 February 2020,"Garfield's a tour de force and the Japanese actors and extras are superb also. There's dirt on the fingers, in the nails, missing teeth and somehow a palpable heat.
Use of natural sound is appropriately pointed and subtle in a film with so little music. Although the mix is odd, as if Scorsese was using recording techniques from the heyday of the religious picture. Garfield is an empathetic human supported by his faith, an equally important Adam Driver sees his faith and the actions that support that faith above all. It's a simple and elegant tale, free of too much judgement and too much didacticism. It's a slow, beautiful, enlightening, sometimes funny tale with a hand in the Terrence Malick camp, a leg in Apocalype Now and a head wedged in Shogun.
Solid, touching, perhaps a little pointless, or seemingly irrelevant, but good quality nonetheless.",Silence
99,CineMuseFilms,A monumental story of persecuted faith and colonial conflict.,8,26 February 2017,"The history of humanity is also the story of violence between conflicting belief systems. The worst of it has always existed along the thin dividing lines that separate the religions of the world. These are perhaps the biggest themes that film can portray, overarching the primal emotions of love, hate, and fear. This is the grand stage on which Martin Scorsese's Silence (2016) plays out an historical drama of epic proportions. It is a political treatise on the nature of faith viewed through a post-colonial lens that explores how one belief system sought to impose itself upon another.As complex as its themes are, the film's plot line is simple. Set in 17th century, two Jesuit priests journey from Portugal to Japan in search of their monastery leader who has reportedly renounced his faith. It was a time when every vestige of Christianity was brutally suppressed by Japanese rulers through extensive public renunciations, torture, and executions. The Jesuits find villages of underground Christians who welcome the priests as messiahs. They administer sacred rites and preach to the faithful who believe the path is restored to the kingdom of heaven. The authorities hear of the Christian resurgence but even torture and killings will not force the villagers to betray the priests. They are finally captured and their choice is to renounce their faith or be forced to watch more killings.Up to this point in the story it is a sweeping narrative of bold adventurism, religious persecution, and richly detailed contrasts between Christian and Oriental cultures. Two hours into the story, the film turns into a psychological thriller when the surviving Jesuit comes face-to-face with the renounced mentor he once revered. The dialogue of this meeting is some of the most existentially challenging commentary upon the nature of faith you will find on film. In portraying the immense chasm between apostate and disciple, the film explores the arrogance of religious colonialism; the interplay of personal ego, faith and self-sacrifice; and the incompatibility of two culturally divergent belief systems. The final chapter of the film provides the narrative space in which the Jesuit must confront his god and himself.By its nature, this is a polarising film. It is criss-crossed with political and religious dogma and the history of colonial conquest. It is rich in Christian metaphor, with several scenes evoking the Passions of Christ, the Crucifixion, and the nature of sin and salvation. Some audiences will view it through the lens of their own religious beliefs, but most will recognise this as a monumental Scorsese work. At two hours and forty minutes it requires investment and some will find the pace uneven. Even here, metaphors are at work as the compression and de-compression of time mimics the tides of religious history. As similar stories could be told in different lands, some might find the portrait of cruelty in Japanese history one-sided. But there is no doubting that this is masterful storytelling with a fine cast and stunning cinematography that offers provocative insights into the nature of faith.",Silence
100,blackmamba99971,Missionary Position,9,16 June 2017,"This was why it was so important to know back then at how dangerous about pushing someone else's religion around. Although each priest had a benign duty to enlighten those who have not once heard about god or paradise, they should have taken great care of how they should spread the word. For over fifty thousand years the Japanese people lived in relative harmony albeit from the constant warring each noble house had made plunging the common folk in between their squabbles. Yet even through such tumultuous times every citizen lived in peace without many wants or needs.Then comes the obvious outsider who without permission steps foot onto Japanese soil spreading the gospel to further agendas of two factions. One is the Vatican, and the other is Christian faith. Between those two entities, wars, and other violent outcomes have created gaps for such innocent, and confused individuals. It would be like walking into an uncharted tribal village who has had no contact with the outside world, and begin to spread diseases in the first sixty seconds. You cannot change a public opinion with just religion alone. Many Japanese people suffered needlessly for the simple reason that Christians thought they were the ultimate glory.I do not doubt their faith per-say but pushing something that has not been deemed viable for such a wonderful people was very dangerous. The idea that those who lived, and breathed in the Buddha's realm to suddenly drop it all, and give themselves to another's teachings is comparing it to learning Quantum Physics overnight. It should be by choice only. Plus the priests should have gained a public audience with the Shogun first rather than going behind their backs preaching the gospel to wary, and often frightened people who only wanted to live in peace. This is why religion has so many flaws on so many levels. How do you get someone to listen?... preach. If they do not convert? They become a cancer in the eyes of the church.Since the crusades the ideology about religion has been lost. There has been no clear resolution as to who is right, and who is wrong. Nobody is wrong. Yet nobody is right either. I found this film rather daunting at how it explains of what the priests went through, and why it was so necessary to let the audience know of their downfalls because of pride in their beliefs. Andrew Garfield played an excellent Jesuit who is bound to the faith but becomes weary of why is sanity was slowly losing to the abyss. The questioning of one's self through a test or life changing event showed at how ridiculous it all was in the end. Not only did the local magistrate deem his holy beliefs as useless but at the same time showed padre Rodriguez that not all men were the same, and rightly so.The aspects of religious convictions are often balanced on a razor's edge. What the magistrate was saying was that he believes in a divine being, it's just not the same as the padre's beliefs. Both could live together as long as both did not bind any person to just one faith. Otherwise Japan would have plunged deep into a war where there would be no return. It is a delicate subject, which has no winners or losers. It just has a philosophical ribbon attached to it that could break with only one idea. I liked this film with such gritty actors, and scenery to allow the audience to appreciate at how blistering it was to live day by day.That and giving us a taste at how unsympathetic the magistrate was along with his posse of samurai crusaders who only wanted to stop the needless interference from outsiders who trespassed onto Japanese soil. Such prideful beings were given a chance to redeem themselves in the face of tyranny but in the end met a demise for which no one would ever remember them for, except those who feel that spreading religion is still a valid nuisance. I give it nine out of ten stars for the beautiful landscape shots, and ocean scenes. Added in are the shots of mountains, rustic villages, and wonderfully choreographed sequences with the noble houses. I recommend this for religious fans, and for those who love old world style Samurai as I do.",Silence
101,david-meldrum,A Profound Adaptation Of One Of The Great Novels,9,11 November 2019,"Based on Shusaku Endo's remarkable novel of the same name, a novel which many consider to be one of the very greatest of the 20th Century, this is a film I was very keen to see - but it took me a long time to get to. It's not an easy sell - over two and half hours on Catholic missionaries living and dying under brutal Japenese persecution. At the time of release, I remember one reviewer saying it was 'boringly pious'; an idea which seems to me to miss the point entirely.Both novel and film seek to understand why the Christian faith didn't take root in Japan in the same way it did in so many other countries; why so many missionaries failed and even recanted their faith under horrendous persecution. The reality is that in many countries where Christian worship and faith is violently opposed, it flourishes rather than dies. So what was different in Japan?That neither the film nor the book offers easy answers is the key; everyone - from the missionaries to the Japanese authorities to anyone who has studied this - has a theory, but none are completely satisfactory.On hearing that Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver had been cast as the two Portugues Jesuits at the heart of this story, I was concerned that they would not have the gravitas necessary; what did work well, it seems to me, in their casting was that their deliberate blankness and sincerity work well, especially in the earlier stages, as the well-meaning missionaries in an alien culture. The film's cinematography is startling and beautiful; in the first half of the film, there are repeated shots through mist or smoke, clarity partially revealed in counterpoint to the missionaries' own certainty; as the film progresses, however, this is flipped - there is sharp crispness to the images, a reversal of the missionaries' increasing doubts, confusion and fear. Other shots throughout deliberately echoing religious art, a painterly style that sometimes even merges into a literal painting. These are the Westernised visions of faith with which we are familiar; but an authentically Japenese vision of what faith may look like is missing - evoking for me the stained glass windows in my own church in Cape Town, where every depiction of Jesus or a Biblical character has white skin.There are hints of Heart Of Darkness and Apocalypse Now - the classic, critical story of Western colonialism; the noble, heroic Westerners journeying to 'dark places' to bring the light, discovering there's as much (or more) darkness in them as there is in the places they have come to.There's so much more to be said; like the novel, this is doubtless a film that will yield more with repeated viewing, and with whatever spiritual or theological eyes one views it with. The title refers to much - the apparent silence of God in responses to the missionaries' prayers, the silence of those watching or suffering the atrocities of persecution - and the silence of those killed by it. The enforced silence of the Japanese church. As one character says, echoing the Biblical experience of Elijah, ""...it was in the silence that I heard your voice.""The film ends with a moment of speculation and uncertainty; a reminder not to judge. A reminder, perhaps, to those so quick to criticise Scorsese's much misunderstood earlier work, 'The Last Temptation Of Christ'. Both of these films require patience, humility and deep reflection from the viewer. Both of them have much to teach even those who are most convinced of their faith; both of them are rich, rewarding, serious films which deserve repeated attention. My personal preference of the two is this film, not least because of my deep affection for the original novel. But it's a film I need to digest and pray on, and it will, I hope, drive me to a deeper reflection on 'Last Temptation....', and much thought on my understanding of mission, ministry and faith.",Silence
102,LloydBayer,"Outside its technical and artistic sense, Silence is both an examination and antithesis on faith and spirituality.",8,30 January 2017,"28 years - That's how long director Martin Scorsese took to conceive this film. Based on a 1966 novel of the same name by Shūsaku Endō, a Japanese author inspired by Christian dogma, ""Silence"" marks the 75- year-old director's 25th feature film in a career spanning half a century. It's a passion project and every great filmmaker has at least one of these films that take a considerable amount of time to produce. For this reason and more, ""Silence"" has the potential to be Scorsese's magnum opus but only time will tell if this film reaches that level of reverence. It is a powerful film and an important one too as an epic reiteration of the persecution of Christians in 17th century Japan; Important, because discrimination against one's beliefs exists today as it has throughout history. The existence of God, and whether religion is flawed has not only been the subject of debate for centuries but also the cause of several genocides that have resulted in the massacre of millions. Using this argument and based on an actual event as chronicled by Endō, ""Silence"" is an examination into questions relating to faith, spirituality, and atonement.In broadening the scope of these questions, we follow the journey of Catholic priests Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) from Portugal to Japan to find their mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who is reported to have been tortured into renouncing his faith. This is a time when most of Japan is still under feudal law where villages are governed by unflinching Samurai lords (chillingly represented by Japanese actor Issei Ogata). They take on the role of 'inquisitors' who capture and torture Christians in the belief that no religion can take root in Japan simply because religion and its doctrines are manmade, whereas true spirituality can only come from nature. In witnessing unspeakable torture exerted on other Christians, Rodrigues prepares for martyrdom but his captors have a cruel plan in place – commit apostasy by openly rejecting his faith, or watch an entire village put to death by refusing to do so. Worse still, all his fervent prayers for deliverance are met with silence.With a run time of 160 minutes, it's a sluggish film to get through and it isn't for everyone either. It's also an unusual narrative given the director's affection for epic crime films. But Scorsese is onto something profound because at the heart of the film are bold and provocative questions on theology and our finite understanding on something as infinite as creation itself. This is reserved for the third act when Neeson's character surfaces with some very logical statements on divinity that even staunch Catholics will find taxing to digest. This is the strongest part of the film and yet, Scorsese's broad strokes aren't about good versus evil, and violence though hellish, is not about hatred inflicted by one religion on another. Although the film's climactic moment is whether Rodrigues apostatises his faith, the conclusion demands psychological insight into the boundless characteristics of love, where sacrifice is at the pinnacle of a triangular relationship between love and loss. In a way this is a paradox embedded in a complex narrative but one that might require multiple viewings to fully understand the inner conflicts associated with the solitary nature of silence.The use of that silence is a little too literal in the film too, with barely any soundtrack or background music. Without which, scenes that convey emotional gravitas loses some of that intensity. There are also issues with accents that feel out of place, yet none of these quibbles stack up to Scorsese's grand fresco of an age old battle between man and his own worst enemy – his soul. After all, Scorsese himself once studied to be a priest but somewhere along those 50 years as a filmmaker, lost his soul to cinema. And judging from the austerity of this film, that's a good thing.",Silence
103,buccaneer21,"Apostasy,Japanese Christians,Japanese Culture And Many Others",8,27 January 2017,"The themes that Silence has for this three-hour film includes apostasy,the persecution of Japanese Christians, the love of the Japanese people for their culture and many others about Christianity and imperialism.One theme that stands out would definitely be about God's nature together with the difference between human nature and divine nature as the film's was basically based upon it.Director Martin Scorsese co-wrote the script with Jay Cocks tells a story of two Portuguese priests -Fathers Francisco Garupe and Sebastião Rodrigues - who travel to Japan in search for a missing priest - Father Cristóvão Ferreira,who was sent there to preach Catholicism,was reported to be dead.Both are accompanied by Japanese alcoholic named Kichijiro. The story was evidently too long.It tried to present various themes as I previously mentioned that required many scenes such as the killing of the Japanese Christians;the Japanese soldiers explaining to Father Garupe on why they did this during the priest's capture;the presentation of Father Ferreira,who apparently has apostatized and has turned into Japanese Buddhist,as well as his conversation with Father Garupe when the latter was sent in jail; and the apostasy of Father Garupe,who turned out to become like his fellow priest,until his death.I felt that the reason for having a long film was required to tackle the numerous themes it tried to present.But too bad that the film fell short in doing so as many scenes became boring and redundant particularly Father Garupe's indecision whether to give up his Christian faith or not.In addition to that,God's divine nature wasn't really fully explored during the Ferreira-Garupe talks for the reasons of Garupe to apostatize in the end was simply found to be minor.Overall,I felt that Scorsese missed scoring another great film in it to be included among his works.",Silence
104,net_orders,Insufferable Unless A Director's Fan With Subject Matter Interest.,5,2 April 2017,"SILENCE. Viewed on DVD. Cinematography = eight (8) stars; set design = seven (7) stars; sound = seven (7) stars; script = five (5) stars. Director Martin Scorsese's latest faith-based epic re-images Japan's history using a well-known 1966 novel (with the same name) containing fictionalized tales of the persecution of Christian communities and the suppression of Catholicism during the late 1600s in southern Japan (mainly in/around the seaport trading center of Kyushu's Nagasaki). Although banned at the time by the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate, Catholicism both flourished and was suppressed depending on the perspective/conversion-status of regional feudal lords (mercantile interests also likely played a major role, as trade with Portugal, and later Spain, was profitable). Two Portuguese Jesuit priests travel to Japan to locate their spiritual mentor and, of course, propagate Catholicism. The Jesuits are tormented by what they see (especially the constant Christian coastal crucifixions), but particularly by God's silence to their many pleas for help/guidance (is God absent, not interested or just being cruel?). Scorsese excessively recycles the Christian New Testament (including a riff on the traditional ""thirty pieces of silver""), tales of early Western Christians forced to live in catacombs to escape persecution (in Japan it's coastal caves), and (for good measure) some Spanish Inquisition torture techniques. Wars are nasty business, and the Director's photo-play seems intent to vividly show that religious wars are no exception. Scorsese delivers two type of torture here. One is evoked by his often histrionic cast; the other can be experienced by the viewer! The movie is much too long, highly repetitious, and sometimes just plain boring. Periodically, the Director loses his audience by failure to continually engage the viewer (things can become overly abstruse) even when it would seem there are critical plot points to be put across (that's why the fast-forward button exists!). Acting is frequently way over-the-top melodramatic (bordering on being ludicrous) by the two non-Asian leads; not so much for the Asian actors. Cinematography (2.35 : 1, color) is excellent. Sound/silence is fine. Exterior sets look good/authentic. Not a movie meant for everyone. WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD",Silence
105,maria2023,Silence Was Practically Silent On The Themes,8,11 March 2017,"Martin Scorsese produces, directs and co-wrote the screenplay of a movie having themes of Japanese persecution of Christians in the 17th century entitled ""Silence"".It was based on the novel of Shūsaku Endō that was written back in the 1960's and it features Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Liam Neeson together with Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano.The screenplay written by Jay Cocks and Scorsese tells the story of the two Portuguese Jesuit priests,Fr. Francisco Garupe and Fr.Sebastião Rodrigues to search for their missing fellow Portuguese Jesuit priest - Fr. Cristóvão Ferreira in Japan. Despite the fact that they heard that he already has renounced his faith,both Garupe and Rodrigues still pursued their search for him by pursuing their trip together with a Japanese alcoholic fisherman Kichijiro. Things did not look promising as they landed to a village wherein Christians are being killed by Japanese soldiers and the priests found themselves in jail.Later,Rodrigues was visited by Ferreira,who has already committed apostasy by renouncing his Catholic faith,in jail and convincing him to do likewise and Garupe himself getting killed.It ended with Rodrigues also committing apostasy by renouncing his faith to live as a Japanese pagan but surprisingly holding a cross when he got buried after death. This movie should have been about people trying to be spiritual in times of stress and adversity.Added to that,it was also about the Japanese persecution of the Christians during the time of history when the story was told.Also added to the themes should be the pride and nationalism that the Japanese people are known to have throughout history.Also included is why the Japanese killed Christians was barely touched in a dialogue and nothing more was explored.It was rather unfortunate that Scorsese's ""Silence"" never really tackled these themes the film was suppose to examine and it barely touched on them.Instead,it was a viewer was presented with a melodrama which touched heavily on the God's silence after prayer and a miracle that Rodrigues was asking from the Almighty God to give him a response on the question,""Should I give up my faith or not?"". No question that receiving no response only made him give up his faith without examining his commitment as a priest.Added to that,the persecution of the Japanese Christians was barely touched as well.It just was presented to show the film's violence and nothing more. In the end,the movie was promising but it failed to deliver on the exploring the many themes it was suppose to present.",Silence
106,rooee,A tremendous gift for a new year,8,2 January 2017,"Having been in some kind of development for the past quarter of a century, Martin Scorsese's Silence finally opens. And after a grim 2016 it emerges as the perfect gift for the new year: a deeply probing and contemplative epic exploring themes of persecution, integrity, truth and faith, which seems not only apt for our times, but necessary. We open with the chaotic sounds of nature – a cacophony of insect chatter and animal wailing – and then we cut to ""Silence"". The year is 1633 and the place is Japan. Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) provides the context. He's a Jesuit priest, captured and tortured by the Japanese for his faith. Jump to 1640. Two of Ferreira's students, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver), are informed that Ferreira has gone AWOL in Japan. The crackdown on Christianity has turned that country into a dangerous place for Christians. Rumours abound that Ferreira has denounced his faith. But Rodrigues and Garrpe believe this is slander, and they set off for Japan to bring Ferreira home. The wandering priests enter a coastal village and are welcomed by the native Japanese, who exist in crushing poverty, struggling under the ruthless, ever-watchful eye of Inoue Masashige (Issey Ogata). Suspected Christians are regularly dragged from their homes and forced to publicly denounce their God by stepping foot on the image of Jesus. This ""trampling"" becomes a key weapon and point of conflict in the story. As the Japanese rulers repeatedly state, it is ""just a formality"". But for the flock it means the relinquishing of faith; a surrendering of who they are. It's called ""korobu"", literally meaning ""to fall down"".When Rodrigues advises the villagers to go ahead and ""trample"", he is applying real-world advice to a punishment that threatens their very existence. Yet what about Rodrigues himself – why should he not heed his own advice? The Japanese believe it's a matter of ego; that Rodrigues is arrogant. But is it not his job to be held to a higher religious standard?The story is seen almost exclusively through the eyes of Rodrigues: his horror at the cruelty of the ruling class; his ambivalent but ultimately loving relationship with Garrpe; his guilt and doubt about his faith and his mission; and finally the extent of his service under a repressive system. After all, what relief can he provide dead? Even if it makes him a hypocrite in life. In the basic plot there are parallels with Heart of Darkness, and by extension Apocalypse Now, although don't expect a crazy Colonel Kurtz showdown. The inevitable confrontation with Ferreira is a philosophical fight. What is found is scary and threatening to Rodrigues, but not for the reasons one might imagine. Indeed, this third act shifts our view of the priests, who were once unquestionably saviours, to something less morally clear. But the greatest parallels are with Scorsese's own film, The Last Temptation of Christ. Like Willem Dafoe's Christ, Garfield's Rodrigues is humanised. He's temperamental, doubtful, even hopeless at times. Always burdened by this divine responsibility, although perhaps less resentful than Nikos Kazantzakis's Son of God. Garfield brings great warmth to the role, and an agonising, largely internalised passion. Special mention must go to the sound design. It's a quiet film but one which is conspicuously bereft of silence. At one point Rodrigues hands a token – a tiny wooden cross – to a poor villager, and it seems to chirrup like a living thing. Scorsese is reminding us that nature is never silent, and rarely is the human mind. By the end, we are left with more questions than answers – which is fine, because they are questions we can all ask of ourselves. Narratively harking back after the lifetime of Rodrigues, we ask: If a person's faith is not permitted to be shown – not fetishised – does that mean it is vanquished? Belief, one might argue, is actually given strength by repressive rules, driven deeper, into the soul of the individual. (Or, for the atheists among us, into the unvoiced subconscious.)All of which makes us look at the broader struggles portrayed throughout the film in general. The Inquisitor frequently refers to Japan as a swamp in whose soil Christianity can never take root. Indeed, as a structured organisation, Christianity may not be able to overthrow the Buddhist order. But on an individual level, leaving aside rituals or tokens, there will always be those who need relief from the burden of their guilt, or who struggle with their personal integrity.In the wake of last year's events, it is sometimes mentioned that we are living in a ""post-truth"" world. That truth is the objective kind, whereas the ""truth"" to which Silence refers is something different: the truth that beneath the artefacts of our belief systems – the crosses and the books and the veils – lies a shared belief in humanity; a desire for order and community. In portraying the captors and captives in a nuanced way, without madness or outright evil, Scorsese isn't obfuscating this greater truth but illuminating it. At 160 minutes, Silence looks on paper like a slog, but it's briefer than your average Middle-earth movie and it is never dull. This isn't Bela Tarr, where boredom is a currency; there is purpose and drama in every scene, and if you surrender to its perfectly paced lull then you will emerge self-reflective, and quite possibly into the most interesting post-cinema pub conversation ever.",Silence

108,Mike_Devine,Scorsese's 'Silence' speaks volumes,8,28 January 2018,"Martin Scorsese has been the mastermind behind some of cinema's greatest triumphs. While some have become pop culture institutions ('Taxi Driver,' 'Goodfellas,' 'The Departed'), others have not had nearly as much of an impact. 2016's 'Silence' falls into the latter camp, although this does not take away from the fact that it's a very well done film.In 'Silence,' we follow two Portuguese Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they travel through 17th century Japan in search of their mentor (Liam Neeson), who has gone MIA. While searching for him, the two priests try to spread Catholicism through missionary work - something that slowly tears the two apart, as the religion is under assault from the Japanese government.Scorsese's signature techniques are on full display here, From the meticulous cinematography - which earned an Academy Award nomination - to the use of symbolism and powerful dialogue, 'Silence' is almost a work of art. Between the raw emotion that comes through in Garfield's performance and the persecution that the Japanese common folk experience, there is a lot of pain and suffering to go around. But it's not all for naught. True, the themes at the heart of 'Silence' are dark, but the way the story unfolds on screen is something to be marveled at.Perhaps the biggest issue with 'Silence' is its runtime. At 161 minutes, the film is excruciatingly long. Some may argue this entire length is necessary in order to tell the complete story, but this really isn't the case. And while Scorsese is known for helming films with super long runtimes, sometimes this works better for certain films over others.While 'Silence' may not have been awarded with box office glory or Oscar gold, the film is one that will have a special place in Scorsese's catalogue.",Silence
109,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,13 January 2017,"After receiving a worrying letter from their mentor Ferreira (Liam Neeson) from Japan, Portuguese priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garrpe (Adam Driver) embark on a journey to reach Japan in order to find their beloved colleague and help the Christians against the religious oppression perpetuating during the 1600s by the hand of the Japanese Buddhists.I think that the best way to explain my thoughts on this film are to start by explaining my history with legendary director Martin Scorsese. Whilst I think that ""The Departed"" is a top-notch film and find ""Hugo"" to be a really well told tale, I have rarely had the pleasure to enjoy his films. That's just how it is. From the 1970s right down to his latest efforts I have always had a really hard time with Scorsese and I have grown to actively dislike some of his films, whilst still finding something to mine and appreciate in them.I find that there is a common thread with what I come to dislike in his pictures. Firstly, I have always had a hard time in keeping up with his third acts, from ""Cape Fear"" to ""Goodfellas"" I have always carried myself through to the ending forcefully and have rarely appreciated his climaxes. I have always felt them as meandering and over long, not really getting to a point. Which brings me to my biggest problem, with the exceptions listed above, I have never left a Scorsese feature with something to take with me, I've never had a payoff, his films have generally left me cold and empty, his thematic explorations have often frustrated me and given me not much to appreciate.I once felt like this must be a coincidence, but the pattern has repeated itself too many times for it to be considered so, ""Silence"" being no the confirmation and actually embodying the worst about my criticisms. This is a religious slog-fest that made me angry in its self importance and complete nonsensical length.Now, I don't want to appear like I'm a jerk, whilst everything I said above is true I can't help but have anything but respect for Scorsese, he is a giant of cinema, his achievements are overwhelming, it just so happens that he really has a hard time in matching my taste and whilst he managed to get really on my nerves here, in particular, because of some of the thematic messages, I still find in all of his pictures a lot to appreciate.For one, ""Silence"" has a great first half, the drama with the characters is alive and touching, the portrayal of 17th century Japan is raw and unnerving, the atmosphere that is captured is genuinely unsettling. The point of view that is established in this first half is not a religiously inflated one, what is moving about it is how we witness the hatred that man can be brought to and the contrast with the innocence in the Japanese farmers is ever so captivating.Driver and Garfield really fuel the drama with some remarkably intense performance work that manages to not call attention to itself. Their journey is unpredictable and the recreation of the chaos and the poverty of the time really hits home. The cultural differences are explored on a visual level other than a thematic one and it makes for some really good viewing, I will fully admit that up to the hour and forty five mark I was following the drama attentively.On a technical level the film does have some fantastic production design, but for the rest there is something that really stands out as being remarkable, probably a reason for which the last hour becomes so overbearingly boring.Then comes the last hour, which shatters to pieces everything achieved before, changing perspective and escalating in melodramatic, masturbatory, religious bullsh*t with an ending that proves its aimlessness and disgusting self-importance. The drama just turns off, it evolves in a discussion that has no heads nor tails, to the point that I felt like it was contradicting itself at times. The ending is abysmal, ridiculous and trivial in a way that made me stand up and leave the cinema angrily without even waiting for the first credits which I always do.If I am listening to a full hour of religious debate which combines ethical and moral complexities to it and I am left utterly bored and empty there is something that is worryingly wrong about the film for me. I was lost for words, every word that was uttered was a further step down for the film, a real disgrace because for a good portion it was going for something an succeeding at it, then came the rest of the feature and made me sick with boredom and anger.",Silence
110,markgorman,Martin Scorsese's brilliant religious polemic. Is religion good for the human race? You'll need to see it to decide. Vital for our times.,8,2 January 2017,"To follow up The Wolf of Wall Street with this movie demonstrates that no director has the sheer vision and chutzpah of Martin Scorsese. We are talking chalk and cheese in extremis here. Not even P.T. Anderson or Alejandro Iñárritu can match his range.As each movie goes by he lays greater and greater claims to be the greatest movie director of all time.But Silence will not be, by any means, top of the popularity list.Because this is film making borne of extreme passion (clearly the source novel connected with him).This is a cinematic therapy session, a philosophical 15 rounder and languid, art-house fare that few will love.It's a beast of a movie, weighing in at 2 hours and 41 minutes. There is no action. No soundtrack (music) to speak of. No sex. In fact hardly any women.And it's about the tension of religious powerbroking in 17th century Japan.For many reviewers I've read (and my wife's view) it's just plain boring. And I can understand, but don't agree with, where they are coming from. It is incredibly slow.Scorsese's lifelong editor, the mighty Thelma Schoonmacker, has either been over-ruled in many places or is complicit in its sheer lack of pace. Certainly it could be cut in places where some repetition is evident and probably unnecessary. That said, its pace is its schtick.The central premise about religion being the root of all the shoot the world had to deal with then, and has to deal with now, is highly topical and that's what makes it an essential movie of our times.It even-handedly plays out the battle between Buddhism and Khiristianity (sic) and leaves the viewer to decide if religion is the root of all evil or that some religions have more merit than others. Given Scorsese's Catholic upbringing this is an impressive feat. I know not whether he remains a believer or an abstainer, but either way this could have made for an overplayed hand either for or against Christianity. The fact that the movie is neither is to his huge credit and gives it it's real moral backbone.It's roundly well performed, the cinematography has a lot of merit and the overall production values are excellent.But this is not entertainment as such; this is a slog. A reason to appreciate cinema. It's notable that StudioCanal is behind it. Surely the greatest contributor in recent times to art-house cinema.There are no laughs in this. None AT ALL. But it is a venerable movie. And I loved it on many levels.And put it this way, it sparked a pretty intense post movie debate about the merits of religion then and now.",Silence
111,coreyjdenford,Silence is the virtue,8,1 January 2017,"This review of Silence is spoiler free**** (4/5)We don't know what Pope Francis thought of Silence when he attended the special premier at the Vatican but rumour is that he possibly gave it (4 out of 5 mitres at best) but may be that was the religious subject that reigns the strength of the film. Based on the late Shusaku Endo's 1965 novel Silence which also spawned an animated short in 1971 it pictures the tale of two priests who travel from Portugal to Japan to find Father Ferriera (Liam Neeson) who has somehow thought that the people of Japan could see the word of God, but without success. But when Father Garrpe and Father Rodriguez (Adam Driver, Andrew Garfield) receive the seemingly final letter from him they are given a quest to find him. They must enter Japan without seen, so when they are on the brink of constant danger from being caught by a Machiavellian Japanese man who thinks that he runs the country and thinks that he can scrape their faith. We also don't know what the novelist will think of this adaptation either but it seems that the decades Martin Scorsese spent trying to make this film it the final result is worth it. Though at points Scorsese isn't afraid of using torture among the residents of Japan who are put through some very harsh forces of torture, as we see images of men and women being burned at stakes, but also there are some men who devout the word of god they are tied to crucifixes for many days on end finally drown by high tide, though these gruesome images are essential stuff for setting up the story of the characters. But as Rodriguez and Garrpe are separated and sent to fend for themselves in different parts of the country to try and teach the other residents. Though the fate is clear for Garrpe but with Rodriguez its not so clear though there are points he seemingly gives up, thinks that the lord doesn't love him and just when it seems he is about to give his life away there is a scene when he looks into a stream and sees an image of himself as Jesus, so he forces himself to some extent to keep going. As Silence starts its stunning third act. It's here through a series of flashbacks that we see what the country did to Ferreira there is final chance for him and Rodriguez to sit done in conversation but as he is trying to convince that he isn't who he was Rodriguez looks to him as if his religion has been betrayed by him, and so he sees an end to his final hope and decides to declare his life to Japan and it's culture as he finally sees that he can't teach the country new things into the world of Christianity. Though the film does flag a little with it's length as it seems that some of the film is prolonged it shows that Scorsese can still create a masterpiece even at the age he is as he also manages to get Oscar-worthy performances out of Garfield and Driver. Despite the length and the fact that it feels a little slow at points Silence is a genius religious film, with stunning imagery that's gorgeous, strong with a hard hitting story that's utterly compelling. And it shows that his imagery of religion in the 1600s is as relevant today as it is pertinent. VERDICT: Yet another masterpiece from Scorsese, it may not be for everyone but Silence is a hard hitting with epic proportions and phenomenal Oscar-worthy performances. It's stunning to see, though sometimes cruel but it's powerful.",Silence

113,eagandersongil,"The renunciation of faith, and belief in silence",8,20 August 2017,"t the height of his 74 years Martin Scorsese returns to a theme already touching on his filmography, faith, with a dream of being a priest as a boy, Scorsese dominates the subject and enchants the heart of all those filled with empathy, being they religious, Or not (as is my case), but it is impossible not to be touched by Scorsese's narrative which is based on a truthful event. ""Silence"" the new Scorsese film that is one of the best films of the year narratively and technically, was unfairly ignored of the festivals but nevertheless, it is still a great film. The script that follows in a linear way, and even can accompany several points of view, focuses on a single character, centered on an introduction, a beginning, middle and final well defined in his acts the film is complete and even with almost 3 hours, the rhythm does not drop for a minute. We have the story here of two priests who are willing to get more information about a priest who apparently renounced the faith, but that mission is in Japan where Catholicism was a bandit and any reference to it is tortured, psychologically and physically. The name of the film being ""Silence"" is not by chance, the word silence is repeated several times in the film, which denotes a perfect parallel with the Catholicism itself in Japan, where faith had to be exposed in silence, where the Catholics and Jesuits were silenced and suffered in silence, they believed in silence, they hoped in silence, and continued with their faith as quietly as possible, although it became commercially strange, Scorsese was precise and metaphorical his title that accompanies the whole plot of the long . The first technical resource that jumps the eye is the photograph of the film, it is beautiful, it seems alive, it gives hope and at the same time it passes frustration, always illuminating and enriching the details of other sets that are very well too, like the Art direction, make-up and costumes, it's no wonder that photography was the only thing remembered for ""silence"" in Oscar, the film also has great mixing and sound editing, and an assembly that helps the script to leave a movie Long look short and do not annoy the viewer, even if it sometimes gets repetitive. Andrew Garfield is great, and is the big standout in terms of acting, his partner Adam Driver is also great, even appearing little, and what less appears is Liam Neeson, even so, the actor has a giant screen presence and it is impossible Not being fascinated with his character, Tadanobu Asano, who plays a character who serves as an interpreter, also commands very well, his performance makes the viewer stay with one foot behind always in relation to being a character.

114,Ramascreen,The latest temptation of Martin Scorsese,8,23 December 2016,"With regards to Martin Scorsese's SILENCE, let me just put it this way, I saw Scorsese's 1988's ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" back when I was in college, as you know that film was also an adaptation, and I thought it was pure masterpiece just in terms of its themes because whether or not you'd want to argue that perhaps that some of the approach may have been sacrilegious or religiously inconsiderate, if you will, to me it was about wondering the what if's and whether or not doubt has any footing in order for faith to grow. To a certain extent, SILENCE conveys something similar.Based on Shusaku Endo's novel, SILENCE is about two Jesuit missionaries who travel to Japan because they have heard that their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly denounced God. At the time, Christianity was outlawed in Japan, so in their search for their missing mentor, they endure torture, suffering, and the ultimate test of faith.In a way you could say that SILENCE is Martin Scorsese's way of paying respect to the legendary filmmaker Akira Kurosawa especially for us fans who grew up watching old time Japan's samurai classics, although SILENCE is not action-driven obviously, but the authoritarian rule depicted in this film is definitely something that's culturally based on that particular era.From technical standpoint, SILENCE is as rich and complex as the story itself, even the violence is done in a graphic yet artistic manner. Because the story is told through Andrew Garfield's Father Rodrigues' perspective, you'll find some of the shots from inside his prison cell, looking out, with the frame being in between the wooden bars, to be quite engrossing. It makes the tension all the more real because your mind just keeps racing, you don't know how much more gruesome it would get. Odd to say this but it sort of becomes a point of anticipation, it's as if every other half-hour or so, you know some Christians are going to get tortured and so you're just bracing for impact. Martin Scorsese's ever-so-reliable high standard quality filmmaking is present through and through, so there's no disappointing you there.After being religious and full of conviction in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" as a Seventh-Day Adventist, actor Andrew Garfield becomes religious and full of conviction again, this time in ""Silence"" and what's interesting is that both films feature Japanese people. All that aside, this is yet another evidence of Garfield's commitment to his work, the same goes for Adam Driver and Liam Neeson who not only went through physical changes, you actually feel a bit concerned for their health, but that conviction is shown in their eyes. It's amazing to see how this former Spider-Man quickly this powerful force. The Japanese actors are equally outstanding, especially Issey Ogata whose performance has his own flamboyant way of being ruthless.This is Scorsese's long passion project, he had been wanting to do this film for years, but the question remains, and those of you who've watched the film are probably wondering it as well. And my answer is no, I don't think SILENCE means to demonize Buddhism. If this film is Scorsese's way of promoting Christianity, then that is his prerogative. But throughout mankind's history, there had been many cases in many lands where the majority religion, whatever religion that maybe, persecutes the minority religion because they view them as a dangerous threat; a symbol of a potential takeover. Inquisitions have happened everywhere. Which leads me back to what I said earlier about how SILENCE reminds me a lot of ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" we see men who are supposed to be like rocks, seemingly falter and start to question their faith, but perhaps questioning your faith is one way of reaffirming it. Liam Neeson's character in this film has a counter argument to Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues and he may make a bit of sense if you see it from his version of truth.-- Rama's Screen --",Silence
115,Rendanlovell,Silence is a near masterpiece.,8,13 January 2017,"The latest film from acclaimed director Martin Scorsese comes in polar contrast to his last film, 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Where that film is all about indulging in excess and living a very in the world life 'Silence' is literally the complete opposite. It's a film that is all about human nature, acceptance, and all that that implies. There's no nudity, no language, and hardly any violence. It's a film that relies on you as an audience member to be invested rather than trying to force you into it. However, the problem a lot of people are going to have with this film is the run time. This film runs just under three hours. Which, compared to the endless ninety-minute features we are getting, can be quite a daunting task to take on. It's not the ""epic"" it's being acclaimed as, but it certainly is an experience. Or maybe even a journey yet, this film almost goes out of its way to not be an epic. It spans countries and eras but it manages to feel small and personal. This is why 'Silence' is a film that will go down in history as a landmark in contemporary cinema. If any film will be studied in film school for decades to come, it will be this.Much like 'The Revenant' the star of this film is the director. The direction here is incredibly precise without being show-offy. There's hardly any shot that felt out of place or over stylized. Which is why Scorsese is definitely the star of the film. It's so breathtakingly beautiful but it's never false or phony. With any other director at the helm, this film would've turned out over stylized or too fake for the content.It's not only beautiful to look at but it's themes and messages are equally beautiful. I realize that a film that's mostly about religion might turn off a lot of people but it does so much more than being just a religious film. It advertises itself as an emotional, spiritual experience, but it's more about human nature. It asks questions about humans and why we are the way we are. And it couldn't have come at a better time. Not only is this about human nature but it also brings in themes of acceptance and cultural barriers. In a time where humanity is rather divided, 'Silence' takes these questions head on. And as the credits roll, I sat in a stupor of thought that lasted until the pre-credits for the next show started up.While we are on the subject of positives, I want to talk a little bit about the characters/performances. Both of which are great. Every single actor in this film (right down to the extras) is absolutely incredible. Andrew Garfield is our main character and he gives a performance like I never knew he could. His efforts in 'Hacksaw Ridge' were admirable but here he actually has substance to work with and boy does he pull it off.As you go through this journey with him you can clearly see what this character is going through just by his physical acting. He is able to show an incredible range and versatility that I have never seen from him. Obviously, his other star roles were mostly in the 'Spider-man' films where he literally had nothing to work with. Which is why his performance in this film is all the more impressive.While I could gush over this film for hours on end I did find two chips in the armor of 'Silence'. One being the pacing/run time. While don't really have a problem with the run time, the pacing could've been a bit tighter in a few places. There were two or three scenes where I was on the verge of getting bored. It never quite happened but, in these scenes, the long run time can be felt. Flaw two would be a bit of pandering. There were a couple instances where the film blatantly spells out some of the film's undertones.This is a very mature, slow-moving film with a lot of moving parts and having it direct us in a certain way of thinking felt off here. Saying, ""You should be thinking about this right now."" is never a good way to go and especially not in a mature film that requires your attention. That being said, I absolutely loved 'Silence'. It's the third film I have seen in 2017 and so far it's the best. And it will stay that way for the majority of the year I think. If you're willing to give this film your time and fully invest in it, it will blow you away. Seek it out if you love movies or if want to see something completely original and impactful.",Silence
116,kaptenvideo-89875,Scorsese's long-planned spiritual project... But boring,4,21 March 2017,"Once upon a time in the 17th century. Catholic missionaries (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) face their ultimate test of faith when they travel to Japan in search of their missing mentor (Liam Neeson) – at a time when Catholicism is strictly outlawed and their presence forbidden.Of all the recent critically praised movies I've watched, ""Silence"" is the one I don't get. I mean, I understand what's happening on screen, and I like the fact that Scorsese realized his long-planned non-mainstream spiritual project... But I find it boring. The first hour or so especially. Also, I was not much impressed by the spiritual side of the story. For starters, there's nearly not enough deep conversations and thoughts for this 161 minute movie. Often it feels that the story is really not going anywhere and the main attraction is Garfield's character having glorious mane of hair and making sad faces. The result would mean probably more for Christians but for others, the far and few meditations on God, faith and human nature offered here may wear thin soon. Or maybe I read too much spiritual literature to be carried away by couple of deep lines thrown to us here and there.The Japanese side of the conflict is actually better fleshed out and more interesting than missionaries'. If it was the intention all along, why is the main emphasis on the latter? After watching Hacksaw Ridge"", I quite like Garfield but his character is one-note and doesn't offer many opportunities to flex that acting muscle. There's a limit to how long I can be interested in watching him look sullen and pout around.Driver's character has even less screen time and ends up unused and bland. Neeson is solid as usual but his role is also quite small.Silence"" felt like a Terence Malick movie, with less beautiful sights and more monotone story. I should try to rewatch in the future. Maybe I will understand then why it's so highly acclaimed. If the name Scorsese wasn't attached to it, would the movie lovers still love it so dearly?I watched the trailer before the movie itself and it felt quite generic, just flashes of action and epic moments searching for a proper common ground. Having seen the movie, I gotta say this approach makes a lot of sense. If one wants to promote ""Silence"", one has to make it look livelier than it really is, outside or in.",Silence
117,cinephile-27690,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen! (Read until SPOIL is read if you do not want spoilers.),10,28 January 2019,"I am a cinephile, and a Christian as well. Both God and movies are very important to me, and I show that by placing all Christian movies above all of my favorite movies. And Silence tops all of them all as the best.Martin Scorsese is my favorite director, even though I don't like The Wolf of Wall Street due to the over the top profanity and graphic nudity-and Shutter Island's middle dragged a bit. But that said, there are many great works of his, and this is the icing on the cake to me.I first heard about it a couple of years ago, and I was excited about him making a Christian movie-I happen to also adore his controversial yet uplifting The Last Temptation of Christ. (I wrote a review of that too-link below.)I later found Silence on DVD and watched it with my Grandma-who enjoyed it but decided that she would never see it again.Silence is about 2 missionaries, one played by Andrew Garfield and another by Adam Driver. They go to Japan when they hear that their mentor(played by Liam Neeson) has renounced his Christian faith. With no other way to confirm this, they travel to the country and face persecution, along with the small amount of Japanese Christians.They have to then renounce their faith for the government by doing acts such as stepping on religious icons or spitting on crosses. And if they refuse, they are tortured to death. Andrew Garfield's character holds onto his faith, but it turns out that it may be harder than he thought it would be.Silence is very violent-which is a factor to consider in seeing this- there are people burned alive, be-headings, crucifixions, drownings, etc. It's not as harsh as The Passion of the Christ, but it can be just as heartbreaking.You do not watch Silence to ""enjoy"" it, even though it's great and very moving. You watch Silence to experience the reality of religious persecution, and to learn how hard keeping faith can be.Here, I have to SPOIL something. Andrew Garfield's character actually steps on a picture of Jesus after he hears Him allow it since He knows his actual heart. However, we see in the end(I won't say how) that he faked it and really HELD unto his faith.(Hint hint.)I told someone I know at church who is against R rated movies about Silence and she refused to try seeing it just because of that. Yes, it's hard and sad to watch this happen, but think about how much Garfield endures for his faith.It's a harsh reality that he would do that, but it IS a reality for some people. This raises an important question: what would YOU do?That is another positive about Silence-it asks many questions and leaves them unanswered for you to answer yourself. Questions like: Is faith worth giving up? What if it benefits another? Does God forgive those who fake giving up their faith? Should you teach your faith to those who do not believe?If you want to learn more about Silence, I suggest going on You Tube and looking up ""The Movie Proposal Episode 12 Silence."" Here, 3 Christians discuss their thoughts on the movie-and one calls it the ""best Christian movie, period.""(This is part of what makes it my favorite movie.)This sums up the main ideas of how I feel about this religious masterpiece, though I could say much more(That You Tube video will help me more.) It's a movie all Christians, and just about everyone else, must see. And good for Martin Scorsese for making this right after The Wolf of Wall Street!",Silence

Before watching web search ""shogun persecuting christians.""I did not choose to play this movie, but watched anyway. As a Christian I'm glad I watched this movie, because the torture scenes are a graphic look at the evil within humans and the persecution that await Christians during the end times.The beginning of the movie was good with dialogue and scenes while the priests are looking for the MIA priest. This 2h40m movie is at least one hour longer than necessary. Many of the scenes are unnecessarily long to really drive the point home how agonizing the torture was. After a few torture scenes WE GET THE POINT, no need to keep harping about it! As the movie plays there becomes less and less dialogue and more unnecessary lengthy scenes with long periods of silence.Most of the voice over narration was annoying and unnecessary to tell us what we saw or what to think about a scene. Character dialogue and scenery of the movie should tell the story, not a voice over. Unless, the voice over is a character in the movie telling the story.CONTENT ADVISORY: People shown being tortured in various ways including being burned alive, drowned, beheaded, hung upside down and slowly bled to death and probably other ways I'm forgetting.

120,dallasryan,Enjoy the Silence,9,29 September 2017,"Silence. A beautiful film. Scorsese has done it again. One of the best director's of our time. Andrew Garfield is amazing in the role of Father Rodrigues. Garfield's Rodrigues shows us what it is to truly doubt, to go on the journey of the doubt and arrive full circle to a spot where he has to accept his fate. As the pride of anyone, we want to fight back when there is injustice and not give in if it compromises our beliefs or our pride. Silence is stating To truly know God and Jesus, we almost have to go against ourselves, go against what we want to do. Jesus Christ fought against what he had to do until the very end, and then finally accepted his fate and came to a calmness, maybe not necessarily a peace, but an acceptance. Father Rodrigues comes to this same end, he keeps fighting it, but in the end accepts what he must do to save people and to become closer with God/Jesus. From there on out Father Rodrigues must pray to his God in Silence to save people and to save his own soul. He never loses his faith and becomes closer to God and even though he's come to this acceptance, he still feels inside that he's betrayed the lord. A fantastic film of inner struggle, the inner demons and doubt we feel, the Self vs. Self we all have and the injustice of it all.How we all fight ourselves, and go through a spiritual journey with ourselves, God and mankind. A truly moving picture, an expansive film experience. Wonderful acting, terrific sound, amazing cinematography. Surprising that it didn't get nominated for a lot more academy awards. It has been said that in the time when people truly heard God it was the people of the desert who heard him. They heard him in the Silence of the desert. See this film, a moving ritualistic experience with the heart and soul and oneness of God. Maybe not everything will be understood about this film, but not everything will ever be understood about God. If everything was understood about God, he wouldn't be God.",Silence
121,coconutkungfu-30704,Very Atmospheric Film on The Subject Of Faith,8,17 February 2020,"Silence features some of the most beautiful imagery to be seen in a Scorsese picture and it manages to tell a very fascinating story about faith. It has a very unique mood that is simultaneously haunting, sad and oddly cozy (strange choice of words perhaps). It really draws the viewer into its world and engages you in its characters. The only thing that detracts and distracts in this film is the fact that Driver and Garfield have been given rather inconsistent and distracting, supposedly Portuguese accents, that don't add to the film and seem unnecessary.Highly recommended to the religious and non-religious alike!",Silence
122,politic1983,Speak up a little,7,5 December 2020,"Shusaku Endo's ""Silence"" is a novel that left quite an impression on me as a slowly developing exploration of the nature of faith and the many challenges it will come up against. It's fair to say that the first Christians, with their foreign religion, faced many challenges in Japan, and Endo, as a Japanese Christian, measures a well-balanced argument throughout, creating both sympathy and a lack of sympathy for the Portuguese missionaries of the story.Martin Scorsese himself went through something of a challenge of faith in the making of his adaptation, taking close to three decades to get it on film. Maybe because Masahiro Shinoda had beaten him to it in 1971 with his adaptation and so he wanted to leave a sufficient gap. But, much as Endo will have struggled with writing plausible arguments against his own faith, it is a work that will prove an uncomfortable exploration for any Christian, especially one who likes Japanese cinema.Ferreira (actual Portuguese Liam Neeson) is a Portuguese missionary who has gone missing since leaving for Japan. His fate unknown, two of his protegees, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver), seek permission to go to Japan to find him. With Japan a dangerous place for Christians in the Seventeenth Century, their quest is refused. But, being good Christians, they go anyway, setting off from Macau on a Chinese trade ship with the drunken, unpredictable and supposedly Christian Kichijiro (Yosuke Kubozuka) their guide.Arriving in the western tips of Kyushu, they are taken in by a village of secret Christians led by Ichizo (Yoshi Oida) and Mokichi (Shinya Tsukamoto). Having never had a true pastor among their number before, the group are happy to have their foreign visitors, but being hidden away all day with their mission going nowhere, they become restless and step outside.This proves their downfall and word spreads. Ichizo and Mokichi are suspected and taken hostage, so Rodrigues and Garupe go their separate ways in their quest. All are soon caught, though Rodrigues fairs better than others. Inoue (Issei Ogata), in charge of rounding up Christians in the area, makes an example of Rodrigues, wanting to him to renounce his faith, making him watch others suffer in his name.At a hefty runtime of close to three hours, this is not always the most pleasant viewing. This is a long visual representation of suffering and struggle, designed to challenge the way you think and feel. But the nature of the story is struggle, and so it cannot be told in any other way. And Scorsese is fairly faithful to the book in allowing the arguments for and against to gradually build as the film develops.Rodrigues is left to often engage is discussion with Inoue and his interpreter (Tadanobu Asano) while he is imprisoned. Talk is often of how Japan is a 'swamp' where nothing can grow, so Christianity simply cannot flourish. The Japanese do nothing to contradict this view and look to reason with him, fairly amiable in discussion. They hold nothing against him, they simply don't want him there.But if they are friendly in discussion, they are anything but in their punishments, which Scorsese shows with relish. The film's most memorable scene is the execution of Ichizo and Mokichi, crucified in the sea, the waves gradually engulfing them. Shown in all its horror, Tsukamoto certainly gives one of the most notable performances.As indeed do much of the Japanese cast: Ogata flippant, cunning and sinister as Rodrigues' captor; and ever-charismatic Asano with a friendly arrogance of knowing he will be on the winning side. Kubozuka is more erratic as Kichijiro, but still delivers in a role slightly out-of-kilter from his usual, pouting self. And I feel I must speak for Ryo Kase, because not even he does. While Driver feels a little more wooden with his affected accent as Garupe; Neeson plays his usual one character; and Garfield a little more non-descript as the lead, though likeable enough.But if ""Silence"" is Scorsese's labour of love, it falls a little short. For all its good points, the strength in the story is building the argument slowly, allowing the audience to think over what they have just taken in. As such, it is more suited to a novel format and may have been better as a series rather than an extended run time film. It is long, but maybe not long enough. From this writer's perspective, for Scorsese, the struggle continues.politic183.home.blog",Silence
123,pranayjalvi,Fascinating 'Silence' weighs faith and doubt,8,28 January 2017,"Silence, Martin Scorsese's long-in-the-works adaptation of Shūsaku Endō's same-titled novel about a Jesuit priest searching for his former mentor in shogun-era Japan, is a truly religious piece of filmmaking, in that it looks for meaning in the contradictions and absurdities of faith, instead of its assurances. Filmed in Taiwan, it limits its view of 17th-century Japanese life to far-flung villages, tiny huts, and walled compounds, effectively alternating agoraphobic and claustrophobic perspectives. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, Silence clashes the spiritual and the practical, the human and the divine. With the dialogue concentrated on the mysteries of faith and how Rodrigues' rigid insistence on God's existence might be its own form of self-deluded arrogance. Silence is an esoteric undertaking that appeals more to the head than the heart. Some may find Silence's agonised self-flagellation far too ponderous and tortured. But Ferreira's appearance elevates the movie beyond matters of Christian doctrine to universal questions about how society should best confront all forms of intolerance. A slow-burn tale filled with beautiful imagery and understated performances, its elegance yields Scorsese's one of the most subtle efforts.My Rating :4/5",Silence
124,austin0731,a lengthy and stunning journey into the power of religious belief,7,22 February 2017,"I particularly enjoy this style of filmmaking, Silence was a long, beautiful journey that followed a very calming pace despite the actually disturbing content. As we follow these two priests through their journey through Japan. I really liked how this film was so long, it really goes to show the excruciating length of their travels, yet it didn't feel dragged on a at all serving as a very well utilized narrative device.This is the second time we've seen Andrew Garfield in a film about religions and beliefs particularly Christianity. He does really well in these roles, his facial language and soft tone just creates such a soothing aura when very befitting of these roles. Liam Neeson and Adam Driver though didn't get a lot of screen time played it well when they were on screen as more minor characters.The real breakout performance in my opinion is definitely from Japanese actor: Shin'ya Tsukamoto as Mokichi. It was an extremely well acted role, the way he moves and talks in this film, the stumbling tone and the way he speaks and approaches the two pastors really shows this strength of his belief. I really liked how this came through in all of the Japanese villagers. Other than that also a shout out to the Japanese actor who played the bastardly Kichijiro, both very well acted roles.As mentioned the theme of belief is so powerful and so impactful in this film as it was in Garfield's other film, Hacksaw Ridge. From the smallest of tokens that the villagers held that had any connection to god to the secret baptisms that the village held. Tomokichi final song, it really is an ode to the power and strength of believing and religion.Overall Silence definitely has its very impactful and shocking moments however it does have its dull moments particularly in the later half of the film but none the less this is a great film.",Silence
125,gregeichelberger,The deafening Silence of unanswered prayers,7,23 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese, who explored religious themes and biblical situations in 1988's controversial ""The Last Temptation Of Christ,"" visits that genre again, only with a much wider scope and with less scrutiny and condemnation; although he always does not have good things to say about Western powers trying the Christianize Japan in the mid-17th century.Co-written by Scorsese and Jay Cocks (""Gangs Of New York""), and based upon the book by Shûsaku Endô, ""Silence"" shows two Portuguese Franciscan Catholic missionaries, Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield, ""Hacksaw Ridge"") and Father Garupe (Adam Driver, ""Paterson,"" ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""), sent by their superior, Valignano (Ciaran Hinds, ""Bleed For This"") to find the whereabouts of a missing priest, Ferreira (Liam Neesom, ""A Monster Calls""), who taught and mentored both young friars. Rumors persist that he denied his faith, denounced the church and is currently living in Japan with a native wife and children, but Rodrigues and Garupe insist this is not true and travel to China and enlist the aid of a drunken guide, Ichizo (Yoshi Oida, ""Open At Night""), an apostate himself (but with loyalties that seem to turn on a dime), to smuggle them into the Land Of the Rising Sun. Once in Japan, where all of the Catholic priests have been tortured and murdered by local Shinto warlords led by The Grand Inquisitor Inoue (Issei Ogata, ""Priceless"" TV series) and his minions, the padres discover a hidden community of brutally-oppressed, but steadfast Christians waiting for these men to aid their cause. This is not an easy task, since guards are constantly searching for members of this ""outlawed"" religion and the two must hide in caves, remote villages and other locations just to avoid detection. When men from another village find out priests are present, they persuade the skeptical duo to help their hamlet, as well. Here, they are told that several years back,Ichizo saw soldiers burn his family at the stake for not denying their Christian faith (by symbolically stepping on a bronze plaque of Jesus), while he conforms almost immediately. Wracked with guilt, he confesses this sin, but again, we are never sure of his true motivation. After the two Fathers separate, Ichizo's treachery is reinforced when he betrays Rodrigues to the Inquisitor (for a symbolic payment of 300 silver coins), who knows that just killing the man of God would just make Rodrigeus a martyr and stronger and holier in the eyes of the local Christians. Instead, he uses a form of psychological warfare, punishing the converts and placing the blame on Rodrigues' pride and stubborn convictions. Again, Ichizo confesses that he is truly remorseful for selling the priest out and vows to make amends, but by now, we are curious just how much more the Father can actually take from this character who seemingly begs forgiveness in every other scene. Imprisoned and forced to watch Japanese Christians executed by crucifixion, drowning and decapitation, as well as the deafening silence of his supposedly unanswered prayers, Rodrigues is pushed to the breaking point only to discover an even darker secret about the man for which he and his Jesuit partner were searching and is forced to make an excruciating decision. Cocks and Scorsese analyze deep passionate themes of piety and self- sacrifice here that attempt to balance out the matter-of-fact cruelty of feudal Japan, but does not spare the Christian religion itself from its pomposity regarding an ""invasion"" to convert the ""infidel"" island nation (cut off by chance, geography and design for thousands of years). Rodrigues is also told that while many of its citizens are willing to accept the Word and Gospel as a part of their lives, few have any clear understanding of just what that entails from a Western and/or European perspective. They equate Jesus with the rising of the sun and base their believes on the simple facts of the natural world which is the only tangible thing they can relate to. It's certainly a simplistic vision and, in truth, is almost as condescending coming from Inoue and other Japanese as Christian principals being taught by the missionary priests. There is no denying, however, that ""Silence,"" while often dark, both psychologically and metaphysically, and a tad long at more than two hours 40 minutes, is nevertheless a brilliant production and showcases Scorsese's passion for this theme.In fact, it's a dream film he has held near his heart for almost two decades and the result of this labor of love shows in the top-notch acting (Garfield, Ogata and Neeson are absolutely superb), wondrous cinematography (Rodrigo Prieto, ""The Wolf Of Wall Street,"" ""Passengers"" and Scorsese's upcoming, ""The Irishman"") and historically accurate costume design (Jack Tung, ""The Life Of Pi"") make this an epic experience and highlights what clashing religions and philosophies can do to innocent people and just how difficult it can be to maintain one's beliefs and morals in an environment of pain, privation and primitivity.

126,harrylosborne,Torturous - exactly as Scorsese intended,8,16 January 2021,"Silence is slow. Silence is long. Silence is not for everyone. Scorsese's lesser-known (and under-appreciated) retelling of this 20th Century novel is a beautiful but relentless film, detailing the brutal reality of bringing a new religion to a foreign land. Amazing cinematography and filmmaking going deeper than basic storytelling portrays the story, acted with suitable gravity. There will be points where watching is borderline torturous - and that is exactly as intended.Unfortunately, this cinematic style will not translate for many people: impatience and tension are both paramount to this film, as by making the viewer feel powerless, you begin to understand just how the characters also suffer. Japan is an amazing backdrop for this story - cultural differences help emphasise the difficulties faced by Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) as they try to survive their new home, whilst also searching for their estranged teacher, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). Japan's architecture, symbolism and intrinsic way of life all lend themselves to the story, whether explaining native religious devotion, or the methods of torture and negotiation employed.Scorsese is not a director I have a deep love for: mobster films do not particularly convince me, and movies like The Wolf of Wall Street are more colourful than they are quality. However, Silence shows a compassionate side and a passion I had not seen before from this veteran; the vision to direct something as stark and yet nuanced as this is something to be commended on its own. The film is a test - not just for the characters, but for those watching - and this technique is so difficult to execute without alienating your viewership.Some of the visuals do lack a critical edge. There are scenes shot on the water or with lavish backdrops that suffer as the result of shoddy CGI, forcing poorly-rendered fog to drift around the characters. Furthermore, some of the dubbing is not brilliantly done, and characters are occasionally seen talking out-of-line with their physical movements. These are infrequent, however, and Scorsese's use of water, darkness and wilderness is truly amazing. Silence is about immersion: if the priests cannot see, neither can you; if the characters struggle to understand, the viewer will as well. The acting mirrors this, as Garfield and Driver both embrace the roles fully, flanked by some quality Japanese actors throughout.Silence falls into a similar bracket as Joker, in that they are not conventionally ""enjoyable"" films. More, they are exhibitions of cinema, bridging the gap between novel filmmaking and Hollywood epics. To me, this might be one of Scorsese's best films - for all the right reasons, I hated it as much as I enjoyed it.",Silence
127,dakjets,Could have been great - ends up as tedious and boring,4,24 May 2017,"This movie was nothing for me. Basically an exciting story, a great director and talented actors. What makes it not good? I had major problems with this ""narrator voice"" that goes through throughout the film. It is tiresome and makes it difficult to get into the movie properly. It's getting tiresome to hear, and this narrator also has a pompous language that makes it a little exciting. I think the movie fails to find a nerve that makes it good. Excitingly, it will not be. The film is also very categorical and portray for example Japanese as very one-dimensional. Last but not least, I think it's tedious. The positive thing about the film is the filming of nature and use of photo in general. It is beautiful to watch. But it's not enough to save this project for my part.",Silence
128,treywillwest,nope,8,16 January 2017,"As someone who became a ""cineaste"" in my tweens, I can say that Scorsese was first a God, then, in film school, a bloated pre-madonna, and now, as a middle aged film-lover, a damn fine, if over-celebrated film maker. This is one of the best films he's ever made, which is not to call it a truly a great movie. Aesthetically, it's breathtaking. The imagery is probably the finest Scorsese has ever conjured. He and DP Rodrigo Prieto create pictures worthy of far greater artists, like Tarkovsky or Van Gogh.Thematically, it's a hard piece of work for a proud atheist like myself to swallow. It's a celebration of religious faith as such. However, despite the overtly spiritual, Christian nature of this work, it fits right into Scorsese's oeuvre, one that has been, at times in my life, inspirational to me. Are not Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas all about an inner, obsessive drive to live up to a presupposed ideal? In all those cases the ideal reached turns out to be an empty goal, a false target. In this work, as I experience it, the empty ideal is the Christian faith, one that, the film makes clear in the most visceral of ways, has claimed many victims, in the service of both ""proving and disproving"" its dogma. But for Scorsese to be human is to carry obsession into the realm of violence, against both the self and the other. One of the strengths of Silence is how it plays out as a conversation between sincere missionaries and ruthless, if clear sighted, anti- imperialists. The film makers intend you to identify with the former, but I did so with the latter. That never blinded me to the fact that both sides were making compelling arguments. I do think the film wants the viewer to take both into consideration, and for that alone it is commendable.",Silence
129,heisenberg12,"Powerful, meditative religious epic on struggles with faith and persecution by the master Scorcese",8,22 January 2017,"Silence is an incredibly well made film about the struggles of early Japanese Christians in the 1600s against religious persecution. Martin Scorcese directs a near masterpiece of a film, beautifully shot, with powerful scenes and good all- around acting. His depiction of 17th century Japan is absolutely stunning, and the story is easy to follow despite the clashing of languages. Gar field and Driver are sent from Portugal to find Father Fierera, who is feared to have renounced his faith among the persecuted Christians. What they discover is the hostility towards Japanese Christians is violent and intolerant. It's a story of the struggle of faith and how far would you go to remain true to your faith and beliefs. In the end, the answer might not be what you would expect. How the inner belief differs from the outward profession is brought into discussion as the consequences of nonconformity to cultural absolutes enforced by the empire's oppression of foreign religious sects may undermine their cause. A well-made movie on many fronts, Silence is unique and comes off like a spiritual, exploratory epic and a work of art with much more depth and insight than most movies this year. It seems like a movie that could have been shot in the 80s as it has an older feel and ambiance to its staging, pacing, cinematography, and characters.While the movie is long, it is mostly engaging, and although the pacing is slower, it still maintains your interest in this reflective, introspective epic.8/10",Silence

It's an irony of history that when you put the story in the hands of Western film-makers you get a spin which has less faith in faith, and seems more in favour of the Japanese state: which is inclined to condone the brutality of the officials in their (ultimately unsuccessful) efforts to root out Christianity. And yet when you look at the eventual results - the cruel monster let loose in the 1930s and 40s which was the result of Japan's incestuous self-begetting - you have to say that history in this case is not really on the side of relativism.Other than that, this is nicely made and performed but depressing, I should think, whatever your point of view. If you're a believer it makes you look a bit stupid. If you're a sceptic it's a reminder of the way ideology can cause people to do things that are insanely dangerous, for themselves and others (but you should remember that you probably have an ideology too).

There were some underdeveloped characters, in my opinion, but I guess Scorsese really wanted this one to be about the priests alone, and their battle with the faith and their captors, instead of verging off path like most films with a romantic story and other diversions for good measure.The film is a bit too long, but it will keep you entertained with a taught story and return to classical cinema from a great director.",Silence

The priests are played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver. The master is played by Liam Neeson. First of all this film is beautifully shot it looks amazing in the shots of fog and beautifully shot images of the landscape of Japan. The religious themes are strong but you can see the real persecution of Christians that was around in Japan at the time. Scorsese really throws you in the deep end of the Christians struggles to maintain their faith and die or surrender to Buddhism in the Japanese world. The man who plays the interpreter for the priests is amazing. An incredible villain he tells things in such a way that you can understand where is coming from but still despise him. Scorsese who collaborated on the screenplay really knows how to tell a great story. Andrew Garfield is an amazing actor and shows so much depth to his character. You can feel his struggle to stay strong to the Christian faith. The cinematography is so hauntingly beautiful that it almost brought me to tears. Liam Neeson when he shows up finally tells an incredible tale of his persecution and his surrender of the Christian faith. He understands that the Christian faith has flaws, but we as an audience can't quite identify with the Christian faith of then than today because things have changed from back then. This is a truly great film that will be studied in film schools from years to come. I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is one of the best films I have ever seen.",Silence
135,Semisonic,God and humanity: Scorsese at his deepest,9,17 March 2017,"I had quite distorted expectations towards this film. One review I scarcely read called it a ""sado-maso flick with priests"". And, considering Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield's sleazy mugs, I was almost expecting some perverse variation of 50 Shades of you know what. Well, truth be told, I have never been so wrong in my life.Silence is a story of two Jesuit priests from Portugal, who go to Christianity-intolerant XVII century Japan to discover the fate of their mentor. That's basically all the story on the surface. Beneath it, though, it's a journey much more profound and mind-provoking. A journey that, depending on how deep you're able to analyze the topic, might make you ponder whether religion is a virus that cares solely about spreading, whether the only thing multiple religions produce is people's suffering, whether your high spiritual beliefs and principles are worth letting people die, whether faith really needs the tangible symbolics, and whether god actually cares about people, or the only thing he cares about is being worshiped properly. And that's just the obvious philosophical and theological concepts Silence reaches for, and if you wanna look harder you might find even more food for thought here.Seriously, this is not a film you would wanna watch in a movie theater. Besides two and a half hours of its running time, I spent at least another hour for just pausing and debating over what's going on and what do those actions imply with the person next to me, sometimes digressing from the film's context towards the universal concepts of humanity and civilization evolution. And that rich ground for discussion, something way beyond the scope of a mere review, is probably the most impressive of Silence's achievements.Still, this film is not just its story, which is primarily a merit of the book the film is based on. It's the way that story is told. And I don't know what kind of cinema magic Scorsese put in here, but he has managed to do an almost undoable job: make the film clearly speak to you between the lines, conveying the most complex and confusing and even intimidating topics and concepts without saying much out loud. The silence that finally revealed to Rodrigues the voice of God is probably the same silence in which we can hear everything that this film has to say, and more. It may sound silly or trivial, but trust me: it's no small feat to raise topics of such magnitude - and make them obviously relevant to our turbulent world of today where people kill and die in the name of various gods every day - without being cryptic like Umberto Eco or pop and glossy like Dan Brown. My only complaint about Silence is its ending, opting out of the open interpretation and thus losing the precious ambiguity and at the same time the philosophical potential of such, but otherwise what Mr Scorsese did out here is nothing short of divine, whether you believe in god or not.",Silence
136,SpoilerAlertReviews,A hard film to ignore.,7,24 January 2017,"This was one of those films that sprung up out of nowhere, only seeing the trailers at the beginning of Christmas, was it a marketing ploy to get larger audiences. One fact that would certify this film as as a box office blockbuster is having Scorsese written all over it. Based on the titular award winner novel by Shûsaku Endô published back in 1966, a work of historical fiction about two jesuit priest sent on a missionary to 1639 Japan to investigate the disappearance and assumed apostasy of their mentor. Scorsese read the book back in '89 and It's been a project of his for over 25 years, but never getting everything together, never being entirely ready until he finished filming The Departed. Whilst it's not strictly a remake, there is another earlier film made in 1971 by Masahiro Shinoda but had an ending not of the original source, being very much to the dislike of Endô. I do wonder if Endô approves of Scorsese's adaptation. Drawing from his own relationship with the Catholic Church growing up in New York, Scorsese gives us themes of compassion, love and faith. I have been trying to understand the motive to why Scorsese why make such a film, being quite different from the rest of his portfolio. He's a self-admitted fan of Japanese cinema, namely Mizoguchi's 1953 Ugetsu Monogatari that lead him onto others like Akira Kurosawa, and then turning into an obsession. There is a strong taint of classic Japanese cinema here, obviously influenced by his obsession, yet Scorsese adds his flair, the close-ups, the lighting and something gruesome scenes he's so well know for doing, but I honestly don't think I would have known it was Scorsese without looking at the credits, and had I not known, I would have been totally shocked, and possibly be in more awe for the Director. We follow Priests Fr. Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Fr. Garupe (Adam Driver) to Japan, in a time she wasn't very welcoming to foreigners. It was common for visitors to be beheaded on the beach. Both on a mission to seek out their mentor Fr. Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who has supposedly denounced Christianity under the torture of the Japanese. Both Garfield and Driver are amazing, portraying their religious dedication with defiance and the uncertainty and fear as they're both constantly tested and pressured, at first hiding from the feudal lords of the land. Liam Neeson replaced Daniel Day-Lewis which occurred because the long delay in production, and I think it's a shame. Not saying Neeson didn't deliver, he does, but I think Day-Lewis would have made an amazing Ferreira.Are people going to like it just because it's a Scorsese movie? Shame we can't do blind tasting look we do with wine, watching it without knowing who's behind the camera, because I honestly doubt anyone could guess it is Scorsese at the helm. It's amazingly captured, perfectly woven into a delicate fashion, but into a very long and drawn out story that can be quite mind numbing for some. Ryan, a fellow blogger shared a quote from Matt Zimmer Seitz's review on the Roger Ebert's website which captures it exactly ""This is not the sort of film you ""like"" or ""don't like."" It's a film that you experience and then live with."" It's certainly a film that's going to be hard to ignore. Being long-winded, and with the subject drama, it's going to be an acquired taste, but it's hard to deny it being a tremendous film, however, personally, far from being my favourite Scorsese movie.

137,Tehmeh,Does the spark die?,10,24 June 2017,"I didn't read the book, nor am I an expert in history, so I will not nitpick about any of that. I will only focus on the story, which the movie does too - thankfully.""Silence"" got under my skin. I'm a believer in God, specifically in Jesus Christ, so naturally I was invested because of that alone, but I believe this movie isn't specifically targeted towards me. It's not manipulative nor does it preach to its audience. Quite the opposite, in fact - it put me in a hard place. It puts you in a place where you really have to think about how you deal with your faith and what that faith ultimately is. I also believe anyone can find something about this movie, it doesn't tell you what to believe or what's wrong and right.""Silence"" is a movie about two Jesuit priests who embark on a mission to find their former catholic mentor, who has allegedly renowned his faith in Japan where he was a missionary. They find some Japanese people clinging to Christianity, and those persecuting it. Sounds like a simple, manipulative shock movie? It's not. While it is grim and there are some shocking scenes, this movie gets you in a different way. There is a constant, underlying story about nature of faith in an environment where that faith isn't welcome, and it's pushed to its limits.I don't recall seeing a movie where a man struggles to keep his faith that moved me this much. It's not about some pretentious, meaningless problems: it's about harrowing situations, forces and things beyond one's control - and also about the inner struggle between pride, despair and doubt. It's inescapable. This movie is uncompromisingly brutal in what it wants you to ask yourself, and it doesn't let you off easy. I saw myself in many of the characters, and it was always about their weaknesses and shortcomings. I don't want to look at those dark parts of my soul, but sometimes I have to, and this movie pushed me there.Every part of the movie has a purpose and it always seems to have something to say. The journey might be long at times, and uncomfortable at others, but the journey is just as important as the destination. In the end we get a glimpse of something. For some it can be defeat, for some it can be hope. Perhaps it's about what the nature of faith really is, when it's stripped out of everything else but its own essence, and that's something I find myself thinking about as I'm writing this review. I find the the ending beautiful in its own way.Everyone is great in ""Silence"". Garfield, Neeson and Driver are very good, and they all bring in that ""something"" they possess. Their performances are without ego. I didn't see famous people acting, I just saw people. But the Japanese cast must be applauded. All of them. Every single one of them, even those with only 10 seconds of screen time, nail their parts. This is not some cynical Hollywood diversity meeting, no, these are real actors doing a real damn good job. I don't want to single anyone out, but Oida, Tsukamoto, Kubozuka, Ogata and Azano were very good. But once again, even the ""villager"" and ""wife"" actors/actresses were amazing and their parts should not be forgotten.Cinematography is great, if you don't count just a few shots that weren't as good as everything else. It's not just about breathtaking scenery - although you get that as well - but the cinematic language is present in the visuals. Same with the music, it works in favor of the film. You almost never hear it, but when you do it's mostly just harrowing noise. It's still not meaningless noise without effort or meaning, because it finds a way to communicate something that visuals alone will not.Scorsese wanted to get this movie made for a long time. Now he did it. It's easy to see why the man who directed ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" would be interested in this story. It's clearly personal to him, but it's personal to me too. It's a sign of a truly powerful movie to feel a little broken after seeing it, only to find out it's slowly putting you back together again the more you think about it.""Silence"" is like any passion project of an artist, it's not going to be loved (or even seen) by an enormous amount of people. It's also slow, probably offensive to different people for myriad of reasons, it's about religion and faith. But it's also about hope and that little mysterious and persistent spark inside us. It's not ""them"" who can kill the spark, it's always us. And even if we feel like we killed that spark and all is lost, perhaps we can take a lesson from Kichijiro...and try again.",Silence
138,NanoFrog,Propaganda: Divorced From Context (Truth),3,25 January 2017,"This is a beautiful but deeply flawed film. Missionaries did not travel to Japan in this historical period ""to do good"". They went as paid agents of the church, of the Spanish crown, of the English and Dutch trading companies. In this fil we have two ""do good"" priests arriving in Japan at a moment when the Christians are outlawed in Japan. We are never ever given much explanation at all as to why the Christians were outlawed. No mention of the lies, the theft, the back room deals, the corruption and plans for conquest of Japan being hatched by the Church and its trading partners. In essence, this film is a fantasy and a collection of falsehood, where the actual truth is suspended fro dramatic effect by an ageing director who should know better and who once had the courage to do better. I find the film so deficient in historical fact, in cause and effect, as to be laughable. It is in fact sad to see such a beautifully acted, photographed and directed film fall into such a terrible pit of propaganda, historical distortion and outright misrepresentation of the church, the Japanese and the truth itself. The cruelties depicted are hard to watch and every one of them is presented without context. There is in fact something cowardly about this film. In the end it does not serve history, the Japanese, the Church or the casual film viewer. It is a cruel- hearted film presented entirely without context.",Silence
139,quinimdb,Silence,9,6 January 2017,"""Silence"" is not going to be a movie for everyone. Coming off his last commercial and critical hit ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", Scorsese now brings us a completely different type of film: two Jesuit missionaries go to Japan, where Christianity is outlawed, in order to find a priest that has gone missing. In a pretty varied career overall, with films ranging from ""Taxi Driver"" to ""Goodfellas"" to ""The Departed"" to ""Shutter Island"" to ""Hugo"" to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Silence"" stands out as one that is completely unlike anything else Scorsese has made. This is apparently a passion project by Scorsese, and it shows. While the film got generally positive reviews, it seems to be one of the more divisive of Scorsese's career and I don't expect it to be a commercial hit. It is long, slow, hard to watch, and it isn't a typically entertaining film, but it is incredibly well made and thought provoking about the concepts of religion and faith.The film begins with the brutal torture of several Christians in Japan by seething hot water being dripped onto them slowly, and reveals that what we are seeing is a description from a letter which is being read by a Jesuit priest to two missionaries. It seems they have been seeking word from the author of this letter, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), for some time, and the priest is telling them that it is time to give up, since they have gotten word from the messenger of this letter that Ferreira has abandoned Christianity and joined the Japanese. They simply can't believe this, and they are determined to find out for themselves.I don't know if I was just tired or if this was the fault of the movie, but from about 20 minutes into the film until probably the end of the first hour, more or less, I found myself dozing off during multiple scenes. Luckily, the slow moving and generally uneventful, but well directed first hour does end, and the small developments made in that time frame do ultimately pay off for the rest of the film, which I found much more engaging and thought provoking. The film begins to ask questions about faith and religion that don't necessarily have clear answers. When does being a good Christian collide with being a good person? Which is really more important? Is there even a God? Is he even worth fighting for? What makes one religion more important than another? Which is more important: your intent or your action? Can you be a good Christian even if you never act upon it or show it outwardly? How do you find peace and redemption? Can you change the nature of a human being? All of these difficult and taboo questions (and more) are handled with grace by Scorsese, and he never truly provides an answer for any of them, but just continues to ask them in a number of different ways. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, and the film is constantly visually interesting in the camera's movement and the blocking and composition, even when confined to only a few locations for a large amount of the run-time. It is powerfully acted by Liam Neeson, Adam Driver, and especially Andrew Garfield, who is a serious contender for best actor this year. Each actor fully committed to their role, losing a lot of weight in order to add to the realism of their character. The film doesn't promote Christianity, but it also doesn't condemn it. While the film insinuates that Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) sees or speaks with God on multiple occasions, it is never clear whether this is real, or formed out of Rodrigues' desperation, and almost every time he encounters God something horrible happens immediately after, making both the audience and Rodrigues question whether God is really there.In the dumpster fire that is known as religious movies, there are few shining gems. Those few gems include ""Breaking the Waves"", ""Black Narcissus"", ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"", ""The Gospel According to St. Matthew"", ""Winter Light"", and, while I have yet to see it, Scorsese's own ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is loved by many. ""Silence"" is possibly my favorite of this bunch, and I have a feeling I'll like it even more the next time I watch it.",Silence
140,destinylives52,Strong And Powerful,9,1 April 2017,"Feudal Japan: Christianity has been outlawed; priests have been expelled from the country but a few remain in hiding to keep teaching the converts. Those who are caught are given a chance to renounce their faith; and if they don't, torture and execution will follow. Martin Scorsese directs and co-writes ""Silence,"" an emotionally powerful movie about two Jesuit priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who volunteer to go to Japan and risk a horrible death in order to find a missing, high-ranking Jesuit (played by Liam Neeson) who was reported as captured and tortured by the Japanese until he apostatized.""Silence"" is a complex movie because of the multiple themes running through it: what are people willing to sacrifice to hold on to their faith and religion; is it okay to renounce one's faith, without truly meaning it in one's heart and mind, in order to avoid torture and death; if God exists, why does God allow the suffering and deaths of those who are faithful and loyal to God; which religion is the true religion; does one religion have a right to call other religions heresy, and by doing so is it a form of self-importance and ethnocentrism; etc. The numerous, elongated scenes of torture will also be hard to watch for most people — yes, this is a movie, but the depictions of torture and executions of the Christian Japanese and European priests are based on what happened to this group hundreds of years ago.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Silence"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Neeson is brought to Garfield so Neeson can explain to Garfield why Christianity doesn't work for most Japanese, and why Neeson renounced his religion. While Neeson does give some valid points, the audience is left to wonder if Neeson is just playing along to protect his own life, or does he really believe in what he is saying?""Silence"" is a great piece of art that burdens the heart with sadness and horror at what people can do to others; and it also uplifts the spirit by showing the courage and sacrifice of those who will take death over renouncing their religious beliefs.

141,cdjh-81125,Martin Scorsese's Schindlers List (Though Not Without Its Flaws),7,3 January 2017,"When I sent to see this film in the theatres about halfway through the man in front of me got up blocking my view and I got such a shock because I had been focused on the screen for so long because this is a film that always grips your attention and holds its through its fantastic performances, intense sequences and smooth directions. I loved the fact that this is a film that Martin Scorsese chose to do this movie because it shows his range as a director as he did such a good job directions this film he used a lot of long takes even during the hardest scenes to watch that helped to give the film a greater impact on me. The cinematography in this film is also stunning everything from the sunny hills to the fog filled pits look nothing less than life like. Andrew Garfield has easily become one of my favourite actors working today, while Hacksaw Ridge doesn't get released in my country for another few weeks I've heard nothing but good things about his performance but in this film he easily gives the greatest performance of his entire career through his performance we very clearly see the gradual breakdown of his character and his suffering was easily easily conveyed through Garfield. Liam Neeson makes his return to drama in this film and while he wasn't in this film much he definitely did a fantastic job while he was there. This film asks a lot of questions about faith and people's interpretations of god and there is a lot of division to the subject and everyone who believes in something or holds a belief in this movie is always convincing, you never take just one side in this movie and the viewers ability to do that better illustrates the struggle of Garfields character. But I can't say this film is flawless for one Adam Driver while very good in this film doesn't get a lot do To he doesn't have much screen time so ends up suffering from a lack of characterisation. Martin Scorsese is known for using a lot of narration in his movies and it usually works but here I found it to be over used at times in scenes where just silence would be more effective. Another Scorsese trade mark is a very long runtime but again here it doesn't always work as I found the ending of this film to be very drawn out to unnecessary levels. While I don't quite thinks it's Scorsese's best I do think that it will go down as one of his most ambitious projects. Silence is definitely going to get a few Academy Award nominations for acting and technical qualities. While this isn't a film I'm going to rush to see again it's definitely one that I'm not going to forget any time soon. 73%/B",Silence

The priests wish to verify whether their mentor has apostatized, but end up facing their own crises of faith. Silence is a huge disappointment, mainly because the main premise, a young priest having a theological crisis in the horror of Godless Japan, does not transfer well to screen. It may well be riveting in the original novel, but the interior world of Garfield does not sufficiently become exterior. This despite ample narration from the protagonist himself, and the bizarre introduction in the last 20 minutes or so of an as yet unseen character, a European merchant whose heavy-handed exposition is, I suspect, intended to close the narrative in a way the images and momentum to this point have failed to do. Garfield performs well, Liam Neeson is reduced to a cameo, and Tadanobu Asano is similarly under-used. An implicit critique of Christian missionary in foreign lands is under-developed.

144,jakob13,When the light of Christianity went out in Japan,7,28 December 2016,"Martin Scorsese took 20 years to bring Endo Shusaku's 'Silence' to the screen, for lack of funding.Set in Japan during the 17 century in the wake of the failure of the mainly Christian peasants revolt against the ruling Tokugawa clan in the wake of the Battle of Shinmabara, in the Kansai region of Japan (including Osaka, Nakasaki, the island of Kyushu and surrounding islands).This salient fact is absent in Scorsese's wondrous film: its absence puzzles the general audience whose grasp of Japanese history is tenuous at best.Pictorially, it is remarkably shot in vivid, painterly colors. Cinematographer Diego Prieto uses fire, the earth, water, air and the vacuum that repression of Christian weigh on the spirit of Japan.Shusaku uses the metaphor of the swamp to designate Japan as unfit for Christianity to take root.But is that true? The Counter Reformation sent forth the Jesuits to bring Roman Christianity to the world. They found fertile ground in southern (Kansai) Japan.'Silence' puts the number of converts as 300.000, including samurai (nobles) and peasants. What, again, is absent in Scorsese script, is that the arrival of Christianity took place in a n age of warring clans, that the Tokugawa Shoguns won, thereby consolidating their rule until the coming of Admiral Perry's black ships forced open in the 1850s, from its splendid isolation.The Christianized south thus became a rival, backed by adherence and, possibly, allegiance to foreigners and the Pope in Rome. Which, it can be argued attacked the idea of what being a Japanese meant, Japan's independence, and the introduction of foreign influences and ideas, manners and trade and customs.The early Tokugawa restricted trade and limited movement of foreigners. After Shimabara, the shoguns in Edo (Tokyo), waged a brutal, merciless campaign to eradicate vestiges of Christianity in and closed Japan to the outside world.'Silence begins with two Jesuits slipping secretly into Kansai to find the only remaining Jesuit who it is bruited has become an apostate.The Japanese authorities forced Christians to step on the portrait of the Virgin or Christ on the cross, to renounce Christianity. Those who refused suffer lingering torture until they expired: boiled alive, hanged upside down with a slit on an artery the better to exsanguinate the victim in a death of a single knife cut, crucifixion, and so on, ,the better to successfully expunge any vestige of Roman Christianity in Japan.Andrew Garfield as Father Rodrigues and Adam Driver as Father Garppe are on a mission to investigate the truth of Father Feirreira's apostasy.Smuggled into Kyushu, they find a group of hidden Christians who find comfort in the priests presence, the reciting of the mass once more, the ministration of the sacraments, ending a prolonged period of spiritual drought.The priests are helped by a renegade Christian Kichigiro (Yasuke Kubozuka), who like the disciple Peter betrays his God (whom the Jesuits represent) three times. In consequent, risking the very lives of his secret coreligionists.Garfield is a figure in black that is strikingly different with colors of Japan. He is pious, self-effacing, but smug in his beliefs. You wonder about these two men gone far away from their home,; the lose themselves in something larger and stranger than the lives they had known. They are driven by the Jesuit motto: for the greater glory of God. They have taken holy orders, they have a spiritual map and exercises to achieve their appointed goals.Alas, Scorsese's script makes them out to be lifeless, lacking animation. Vapid is the best term to portray Scorsese's concept of them. His genera; conceit may arise from the religious training he received in the old St. Patrick Cathedral School in Little Italy more than 60years ago.Scorsese is, I believe, a very spiritual man, and his film clearly raises questions of right and wrong and salvation.However, for him and his reading of Shusaku's 'Silence', he has sunk into a Western bog when it comes to Japan.And yet, the Japanese characters are full of life and they, in contrast to the Jesuits, are colorful, complex and complicated; and be they peasant or samurai, they come out of the screen, leaving sensory scratches on our minds. They are earthy and full-blooded, they are subtle and keen and maliciously playful in playing hot and cold to stamp out traces of Christianity.Tadanobu Asano as the interpreter and especially Issei Ogata as the wily Inquisitor can, in my mind, rivals Dostoyevsky's breaths much life into 'Silence'. The Japanese cast does a yeoman's job and deserves high praise.In the end, an apostate priest remains in Japan. In a way, if you recall the ending of Evelyn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited', the hero Charles Ryder kneels in the Marchmain' chapel, once again consecrated with the red flame signaling the presence of Christ in the tabernacle, Garfield remains, despite his spiritual sacrifice, a priest, a representative of Jesus in a Japan where technically no practicing Christians remain. But Garfield is that red light until he dies.Truth be told in Kansai, secret Christians like cryptic Jews embraced Buddhism, but introduced Christian beliefs in it.In 1868 when the Emperor gained power, hidden Christians reemerged after 200 years. And they could openly practice Christianity again. But the religious cleansing and the closure of Japan to the outside world did its work. And so they remain a very small minority today.But Christians in Kansai were not spared further suffering. For the plutonium bomb that the Americans dropped on 9 August 1945 wiped out a goodly number of Japanese Christians, and those who survived bore the scars of radiation.In all, 'Silence' is worth seeing. And better yet, reading Shusaku's excellent novel.",Silence
145,stonedraim,Cinematography. Period.,5,12 February 2017,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.To the point. Do you like movies about religion and its priests and gatherings? Then look into Silence. Otherwise, just ignore this. Silence comes into play as two priests search for their mentor and spread the word and faith of Catholocism. It is fascinating how the world and people has developed from the surrounding religion and faith that were all mighty life through God. There is strong similarities between the fate of the priests and the movie itself, and the known story of Jesus Christ and his suffering, becoming a martyr.Martin Scorceses presence is touchable in here. The silent tempo with the dialogue... it is Mr. Scorcese, that is right. The length of the movie has also MArtin Scorcese written all over it, and that is on the bad side. If Silence were just about one hour in length in all, it could have been well worth the watch. Now... it is just passing by. Add to that what is written below under the production section.On the upside, there is a natural and comfortable pace and display of the story in ""Silence"". That is shown and delivered in a good way. Almost free and a prayer parallel during the entire movie.On the outside and the poster of ""Silence"", you see Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is just a little figure being in play some minutes in the film. To put him on the poster is a trick taken from the 80's: put the most known actor first, how little he or she may be in the movie. Naive and false trick to market a movie. Used here, in 2016. I say; what??This is the first film is a looong time that I have fast played forward during the film after 40 minutes. That is remarkable.Andrew Garfield. It is highly interesting that one actor can be involved in one confusing and poorly executed movie, and at the same time and year be involved in a great one and also Academy Award nominee, ""Hacksaw Ridge"".Over to the movie as a product: - The production : It was a looong time ago I saw and heard so bad editing, both visual and of sound. Several times the sound goes up and down in the same take. You can hear the wind in the microphone (one example: about 28 minutes into the motion picture). The visual editing time to time is so bad that you can easily and comfortable see that things is changing within the seconds in the same scene. Maybe I also saw the same scene being used twice (watch as Garupe ((Adam Driver)) is hitting hard in the cabin to split the food up). If that is so, this is almost a new low speaking of great productions and speaking of movies nominated for the Academy. The make-up is easily to discover, especially as the Japan Christians is crucified near the water; this is awful! At the same time frame of the movie, you can see how poorly executed the production is as a Christian from Japan is hanged on a cross only bound by his arms. His legs are free and still his arms is bent as he stood on something... what is this? Have the production team just almost fumbled totally on this one? The cinematography is amazing and wonderful, yes, and there the Academy Award nomination comes in hand. Otherwise; I'm so surprised that the surprise almost switches to a chock... oh, my! - The actors : Sometimes Mr. Scorcese is grasping for the natural behaviour so far and too far, that it becomes bad acting. There is a thin line, yes... and Mr. Scorcese had to be blind for that. - Entertainment : Religion, Japan and priests. Entertaining... for me, a vast no. - Age : 154,6 out of 10.

146,paulijcalderon,I was silenced after watching it,10,1 February 2017,"Wow, I would be lying if I said that I wasn't silenced after watching this film. Really interesting subject matter. I am curious about the book now. When I first heard about the film I thought it looked like a modern ""Andrei Rublev"" set in Japan. Well, I was wrong about that. This film is very much its own beast. These are my first impressions right after seeing it.I didn't know much about the history of the Jesuit priests who traveled all the way to Japan. I did know that some Japanese converted to Christianity, but I didn't know there were that many. So, I was very surprised by that. It does explain a lot though. I understand more of the reasons why a civil war started in Japan that would ultimately lead to any foreigner being banned from the country. It's actually very interesting how the Japanese Christians almost feel more faithful than a lot of the European characters.This film explores both the beauty and the horrors of humans and their faiths. There are many beautiful calm scenes where you can relax and admire the stunning sets and locations. Then there are many scenes that will make you nervous, emotional and horrified because of the cruel punishments that some people must endure.Religion is an interesting subject matter and everyone has their own different view and opinion on it. I still haven't finished processing this film yet, but I'll tell you this; it's something that will stay on your mind for a while. It makes you think about a lot of things. Like what's right and wrong about the different views brought up in the film? And how would things have been different if everyone would have accepted each others beliefs? And even if they didn't believe in the same thing, could they all still live in peace?It's not an action packed adventure, but more of a spiritual journey with exploration about morals, history and so much more. I thought it was wonderful, but do see it if you can and judge for yourself.",Silence

148,Rawal_Afzal,Poses some powerful questions but provides zero answers!!!!,5,30 March 2017,"It started off as something very unique and extraordinary, then you prepare yourself for the path that it takes, but then comes such a twist (by showing Rodrigues dying with a crucifix in his hand) that makes you feel robbed off a good ending, makes you question the whole purpose of those 160 minutes.It's really confusing as to which idea or what concept this film sides with.1. That, that faith can be practised even privately even after apostatising? That's problematic because they then shouldn't shown Rodrigues help the Japanese government further Christians who'd try to sneak in Christianity-related symbols and objects as means of propagating the religion. Why doesn't Rodrigues make even a slight attempt at saving a single Christiant by not even pretending not to have known that a certain symbols/object was a Christianity-related one? How would such an act go with God - that is, the act of helping the others catch and punish your fellow believers?2. If it favours faith and also shows that it can still be practised privately, then why did they've to make Father Ferreira's argument to Rodrigues sounds so convincing? It suddenly sounded as if it's against the concept of Christianity.3. If, again, the purpose was to show that faith never dies and can never be taken out of an individual who believes no matter what the circumstances are, then why did they show on countless instances Rodrigues question himself and his faith? Such scenes actually gave a strong feeling that it questions the purpose and the idea of faith.4. If it's whole idea was to criticise the Church, then at least this film hardly holds the right to point fingers at Church/Christianity/faith because it's exactly as confusing and impractical as it portrays faith to be.Make no mistake, this film poses some powerful questions with the circumstances that it creates: for example, showing Rodrigues question himself as to what Jesus would've done in his situation, a unique situation where he's given the choice to apostatise in order to save other people's lives. A powerful question indeed, because, as it is, the Bibical account is solely of Jesus tolerantly facing the violence upon himself which, as hard as it is, is still a decision and a choice that brings far less regret than when someone else is killed because of your action, or inaction in this instance. But here too, it shows something strange: Jesus' voice is heard by Rodrigues which actually asks him to step on that symbol, which is a fair interpretation of the noble man that Jesus of Nazareth was, but why doesn't the same voice guide and stop him from helping the Japanese government in catching other Christians?Kichijiro's repeated offences and confessions were a masterpiece though and extremely thought-provoking, and Rodrigues questioning himself about him and whether Jesus would forgive such a man too was very powerful.Coupled with that, I loved the atmosphere that it shows of the persecution of Christians and how for a fearful life it must've been for the minority of any faith living in a place where any day could bring about your death; and equally creative yet very painful were the punishments shown that they handed to the people caught by them. However, the thing remains that the film this film had the ingredients of all-time greatness, but chooses to take a route that confuses you more and more. It pretends to be knowing the answers, but in the end doesn't have a single solution.",Silence
149,mbhgkmsgg,Silence,10,6 December 2020,"Silence is an incredibly powerful film. It captured my attention from the very first second, but it also captured my thoughts for its duration, as well as for the time after. When a movie does that, it is special in some way. And this film certainly is special.Although religion is a central driving force behind the narrative, this film isn't really about religion. This film tells of the battle between Buddhism and Christianity, and Japan and Portugal. But those religions and countries could be replaced by others. This change wouldn't hurt the narrative or make it any less impactful. So, what then, is this movie about, if not religion?
It's a movie about faith. It's a movie about our relationship with faith. How it can drive us forward and how it can affect us. How it can let us down, and how we see it at our darkest moments. These themes could be applied to any religion. They could even be applied to things other than religion. As such, I believe it's false to look at this movie as one purely about religion.Moving the focus towards faith and the narrative, we find ourselves joining two Jesuit priests on their quest to find a fallen priest from Japan during the inquisition. A premise that could've been approached in very different ways. The approach that Scorsese takes is one of conviction, deliberation, and discovery. A film like this could've easily been overly violent, but the focus here is on faith. The way Silence explores faith, be it through hardships or success, left me moved. Although I'm far from being religious, the power that this film had on me was surprisingly impactful. Seeing how far people are willing to go for their beliefs and their faith, but also how unwavering faith can be in those who are supposed to teach it to us, left a profound impact on me. But alas, as much as I would like to describe how effectively faith is explored in this film, I simply can't. This is one of those movies that needs to be experienced. How you see and feel this movie depends entirely on how you see and feel faith.While the power of the story moved me immensely, what struck me the most, was the beauty of this film. When I said that Scorsese's direction was deliberate, I was mainly referring to how this film looked. Every shot was composed and framed with such care and deliberation, that, at times, I was transfixed by the sheer beauty of what I was seeing. Certainly, the stunning scenery helped. Silence is easily one of the best looking movies that I have recently seen. And although it deals with a heavy story that can feel hard to take in, the calming nature of the way it looked, helped make it more palatable.Silence is one of the most powerful films that I have ever seen. It's slow and difficult. But it's also beautiful and meaningful. Although it can feel even a little too slow at times, the overall effect it had on me makes it more than worth it.",Silence
150,georgioskarpouzas,Universalist v nationalist religious loyalties,8,8 January 2017,"Before going to watch this movie I had read a lot of reviews and opinions about it. Positive and negative. In Greece where I live the review of the leading daily ""Kathimerini"" was politely and mildly negative. I share an interest in the portrayal of religion and spirituality on film therefore I decided that ""Silence"" was worth seeing. Despite a rather unpromising start mainly because of the vivid depiction of human misery and wretchedness, the story becomes more interesting, the depiction of Japanese society more diversified and you are treated with some superb dialogue between characters embodying different world views.Japanese authorities regard Christianity as a subversive force and a foreign influence threatening the independence of their country. The argument is that Christianity may be good and true for Portugal and Spain but that does not mean that the same can be told for Japan. To this point the hero of the story Jesuit Father Rodriguez answers that something can be true regardless of time and place denying thus relativism and parochialism in religion. If we supplant 17nth century Roman Catholicism with modern day Human Rights we may have a glimpse of the same perennial debate couched in present day terms.I will not enter in more detail so as not to reveal the plot to those not yet familiar with it. Although the setting of the movie is situated in 17nth century Japan and the predicament of Christians there, the questions asked have a far wider significance and resonate to our own times as well. The context is Catholic Christianity but one can ponder to the limits we can go to be steadfast to the beliefs which form the core of our identity. The sufferings people undergo to remain constant to their faith. On the other hand one has to reflect on the right of a culture and a society to safeguard its particularity against what is perceived as onerous foreign influence. Those are not easy questions and the movie does not give easy answers.Images are striking especially those of nature, weather and sea. A feast for the eyes. Dialogue is also top notch specifically concerning issues of truth, religion, tradition and such topics. The actors are very good. The pace is rather slow and the depiction of torture quite disturbing. Misery and wretchedness abound but also wit and conviction.I do not think this movie is a masterpiece but I found many things to be impressed. If your are interested in spiritual issues you should probably watch it. It is boring at times but it is original, brave and special. If such questionings leave you cold then you should think twice before attempting to go....",Silence
151,manuel_medeiros,Puzzled as to why Silence is rated so low,9,30 October 2019,"This is perhaps one of my most contrarian ratings on IMDb - I really think Silence is an amazing film and cannot understand why it is rated as 7.1(!) at the time of writing.Often referred to as Scorcese's life project - as he spent over 2 decades trying to gather the budget to produce it - Silence dives into the journey of two Portuguese jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver) to Japan in the 17th century, with the aim of finding their mentor, father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who is rumoured to have renounced his faith.
The script was based on Shusaku Endo's novel written in 1966.The imagery of this movie and tonalities are amazing, and really help create the feeling of discreteness and concealment associated with practice of Christianity in Japan in that age, under severe persecution - Silence was even nominated for Best Cinematography in the Oscars.I have no particularly sympathy for Christian missionaries (Japanese persecution is perhaps no different or worse than what the Inquisition did in Europe) but the way Scorcese depicts the struggle those priests face, between spreading the faith and putting their followers in danger, is absolutely gripping.
There are scenes which are incredibly hard to watch, but in a good way.The only reason I see for this movie to have less than a 10 are perhaps:
a) casting of Andrew Garfield - don't get me wrong, his acting is great but hard to see him as a pious priest of 17th century given his lush head of hair and after playing Eduardo Saverin or Peter Parker
b) main character personifying Japanese persecution is very cartoonish, with a high pitched voice and overall comes across as too biasedNot the only Scorcese movie that touches on religious matters (Last TEmptation of Christ and Kundun) but definitely very much worth watching

152,annuskavdpol,Roman Catholic to Buddhism by the crack of a whip,9,18 January 2017,"Watched Silence in Capitol 6 last night in Victoria City. I think this movie is about a resistance to change, and that is why this movie, even though it is about circumstances that happened many hundreds of years ago, it still relevant in 2017. The Japanese in this movie had the power and the authority to outlaw Christianity; and they did so in a very clever way. This movie was able to capture some of the details of power - for example, the Japanese were able to use techniques which in essence was the defamation of the R. C. religion. Perhaps this was an example of how colonization through religion did not work in Japan; whereas in other countries like South America, it did work. The 2 priests that were sent from Portugal did seem to believe in the truth of R.C. - was it is debatable if they were actually out to harm the Japanese with intent (by innocent Japanese laying down their lives in the name of Christianity). I give it a 9/10 because it is about a topic that I am currently interested in - the resistance to change.",Silence
153,tmpsvita,Silence the sound of the faith,8,6 July 2018,"In 2016 Martin Scorsese produces, writes and directs a film that was completely snubbed by both the public at the box office and the Academy Awards, despite the discrete criticism it has received.
Silence cost 46 million dollars and earns only 7 at the American box office, a film that certainly deserved greater consideration but the duration of 2 hours and 40 certainly did not favor it.
A really long time for a film with a very challenging plot, taken from the novel of the same name, which is however managed impeccably, so much so that time runs without this being felt, thanks to a great atmosphere that makes immediate the immersion in the film by the viewer.
Of course the plot, and it can be seen even just seeing the dimensions of the book from which it is taken, is very diluted but this does not affect at all because in the most static moments, silent or anyway in which the story suffers a slight arrest, the viewer can enjoy the magnificent artistic component that makes ""Silence"" a real painting to be admired constantly.
Thanks to a cinematography that is able to cleverly exploit the light and colors that enhance the fascinating and evocative scenographies that are the background to a story that otherwise could have been uninteresting.
Admirable Scorsese's ability to make the whole film a great testimony of the Christian Church accessible and appreciable even by those who, like the undersigned, do not share its ideals but nevertheless can not remain charmed, almost envious, for the protagonists of the story paintings with great respect and admiration by the director himself.
A directing from a technical point of view that is simply perfect, with intelligent camera angles and movements and extremely functional long shots, but what is missing is a greater thrust on emotions and feelings that are represented but that can not pierce the screen, probably also because of the script, obviously pretentious and introspective (positive aspects for this type of film), but that fails to excite as much as a story like this could have done, perhaps even for some slightly predictable steps and some redundancies avoidable.
This is also due to the somewhat restrained interpretations, almost detached by Adam Driver, which I found subdued, and by Liam Neeson who could have given much more. While Andrew Garfield confirms his great talent again giving body and soul to a role that is anything but simple to interpret.",Silence
154,felipepm17,Silence Review,9,11 July 2019,"This movie is very long, but it's very good too. The film has a very slow pace and the progress is very linear, but nevertheless never got boring. Andrew is amazing again. The ending is interesting, although not happy.",Silence
155,RMurray847,Challenging but oh so worthwhile exploration of faith,7,8 January 2021,"SILENCE is a film you need to steel yourself to watch. You should not just throw this on at a whim. It's 2 hours and 40 minutes, and it is not exactly briskly paced. It is challenging intellectually (and perhaps spiritually, which it is meant to be), and isn't ""fun"" to watch. But it rewards careful, thoughtful viewing. Martin Scorsese often deals in religious themes...either directly or not, but this film is in many ways his most direct look at FAITH. What does it mean to hold on to your faith in the most difficult of circumstances, particularly when God isn't answering your most fervent prayers? Does that sound like a fun topic to spend so much time with? No? But again, come prepared to watch and listen and with an open mind...and you may be rewarded.I am not religious (but have belonged to churches in the past), and I don't want anyone thinking that I feel this movie will ""make"" you religious or faithful. But even if you are not, surely you can acknowledge that faith IS important to many. This film is set in the 17th century, and follows two young priests who bravely travel to Japan, a country that is dangerously hostile to Christians. And in this ""unenlightened"" time, belief in God and the redemption offered by Jesus was serious business. Even if you are someone who scorns religion in our day and time...please recall the context of the film.The two priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) live in terror of discovery. For capture is likely to mean torture and possibly death...but even more dreadful for these frightened but sincere young men is the notion that they may be driven to renounce their faith. That in the end, they will give up their very souls because they won't have the strength to do otherwise.The film explores this notion to a great degree (arguably perhaps just a bit repetitively). If you renounce your faith to save yourself or others...will you truly be damned? Can you keep your relationship with God even if you have renounced him to the world? Can such apostacy be forgiven? (There is a Japanese character in the film who continuously renounces his faith and then confesses his sins and is forgiven. Is this actually a viable survival strategy?) Anyway, the film grapples with tough topics and in typical Scorsese fashion, does not shy away from gruesome details (although he has done far, far more graphic work). I won't tell you more plot details...I'm really just trying to convey that this is a film that takes on some big issues and does not offer easy answers.Garfield is quite credible in his role, and Adam Driver makes an excellent counterpart to him. Driver, in particular, very much looks the role. Be warned, Liam Neeson is hardly in the film. His character looms large, but is only seen for a few minutes. The film features much gorgeous scenery (I saw it on Blu Ray...highly recommended.) Everything about it is immaculate, in typical Scorsese fashion. The sound is wonderful, the costumes detailed and convincing. I recommend the film...but again, with a strong warning to give it the attention it is due. There is no ""multi-tasking"" allowed while watching, unless you want to just be bored by the film. It asks to you to participate in mulling over the big issues it presents. Reward yourself by going along on that journey.And if you ARE religious, I think you'll find your faith challenged. Not your belief in God and in the ""rightness"" of your belief...but you'll be asking yourself...how strong is my faith? Were I to face a similar circumstance, how would I respond? This film is NOT sacrilegious (although it is strongly Catholic)...don't worry about that. But it asks you direct, uncomfortable questions.SILENCE is an immersive, lovely and challenging film.",Silence
156,jeannefrancoise,Silence movie is not well as the book,6,30 March 2017,"Well, dear readers, let me explain why I can not appreciate this movie Silence in high values, even though it is directed by Martin Scorsese, the popular known director and the valuable man of acting world these days. First is because I already read the book. The book Silence of Shusako Endo is amazing. It explains clearly why Japanese people can not be separated from their deep belief of the Kingdom and the Sun. Each religion comes to Japan is devastated in the bush. Japanese's God belief is their own belief and no religion can conquer them. Maybe this core message that Scorsese wanted to build in this movie, but at some points we missed many things. I agree that the title in the book kept in the movie, but the spirit is gone in dramatic way. The viewers can not define the role of the actors, the plots, and the ending. They are just flowing too fast without explanation. The other thing is the role of Liam Neeson. For first I thought that he will lead the plot and be the center of the story as his image on the poster of this movie in all advertorials, but I can judge that without Neeson, this movie can go. So, I can critic this movie must be remade and please give some more details about Japanese culture, traditions, values, and history, so that the viewers can see what happened in that period of Catholic Missionary in Asia, just like they are reading in the book.",Silence
157,pinokiyo,You don't need to be religious to find this film intriguing,8,8 February 2017,"I am not religious and I really don't think you have to be religious to find this film so fascinating.It just so happens to be about Christianity and faith, but one can take the film and relate to it with anything that they're extremely passionate about. For example, rather than religion, what if one was a really passionate soldier fighting for their country, and they end up being captured by the enemy; if they don't burn or spit on their own flag and respect the enemy's culture instead, their family or close friends would be killed. The use of severe torture was a way to get the religious groups to apostatize; this story is extremely relevant in today's society (or any era for that matter) -- think about it, the use of waterboarding can make ANYONE admit they're terrorists. I think it also questions about pride/thinking rationally in certain situations. To some, throwing away your pride and dignity is as good as being dead. It is a catch-22. What also makes this film/story interesting is how people can interpret it completely differently; one can see the behavior as being selfish/cowardly or entirely respectable.First of all, the Old Samurai Inoue (played by Issei Ogata) is fantastic. He just has this bizarre creepiness charm to him, almost like an iconic cartoon character... just has that same presence that Christoph Waltz had in Inglourious Basterds. The Interpreter to Inoue (played by Tadanobu Asano) is also excellent... of course he has the best English out of all the Japanese actors. It's that friendly charm that makes the characters much creepier/deadlier/nastier than the stereotypical villains. The best villains don't believe what they're doing is really wrong. Kichijiro (played by Yosuke Kubozuka) is an absolutely hilarious character. He is like a rat. He seems to portray the typical flaws of being a human. The main character has trouble deciding many times throughout the film, seesawing back and forth on what to do, and Kichijiro's character is always like a mirror metaphor to him.The dialogues between the Samurai/Interpreter/Rodrigues defending Buddha and other metaphors throughout about one seed may grow in one country but dies in another/the land being a swamp is really interesting. At first when I found out the movie was going to be 3 hours, I thought that was going to kill me, but it wasn't bad at all. The beginning is a little slow (they could have cut that whole China part), but it gets really interesting towards the second half. If you're just into mindless fast cutting action films and not so much a deep thinker, this film is not for you. This movie is based on the 1966 historical fiction Japanese novel by Shunsaku Endo. There was also a movie made in 1971, which has some similar scenes, but I definitely prefer Scorsese's version. This should be the real winner for an Oscar, but I'm sure Hollywood loves Hollywood, so they'll end up giving it to LA LA Land instead. Andrew Garfield is really becoming a big star than just a super hero. If you enjoy character study and great dialogue/something that makes you think, definitely watch it. It's really tragic and haunting.",Silence

The story is weak and actually makes little sense, with Catholic priests from Portugal wandering around medieval Japan and having no trouble chatting to the natives - highly improbable. The acting does not really match the times and the direction is clearly a 20th century notion of what 17th century Japan was all about. The script likewise. The only bonus was the absence of the usually ubiquitous background noise.""Silence"" is a film heavy on 'meaningful' scenes and symbolism and utterly lacking in attraction to a normal, that is a bog standard film going, audience. It is slow and turgid. Frankly after less than 45 minutes I had no idea what the point was and I was bored rigid, so I gave up. It is clearly some sort of commentary on medieval religious ideas and activities but I'd much rather hear about such things from expert historians than pretentious film makers.Forget that it has Liam Neeson in the cast, he's been hardly seen other than a brief appearance at the very start. Ciaran Hinds likewise appeared very early on and most of the rest of the cast seem to be unknown, at least to western viewers, Japanese. Perhaps these Japanese actors are great stars in their own land but they made little impression on me.Those who have seen it will no doubt be split into 2 camps - those wowed by the cinematic genius of Scorcese and those, like me, who simply want a good film to watch.

The film had a look of a film with too low a budget to really project time and especially place. That said, the questions raised by the film are questions about the existence of God which I have heard raised many times before. The difference in Silence is that there are actual answers. Not necessarily answers with which I agree. But answers well-enough presented for me to understand how the characters were as enthralled in the Church, in their beliefs, as they were.

161,marydm-43470,Nah. Just Nah,3,31 March 2020,"Just because Scorsese is undoubtedly a great cinematic genius it doesn't mean everything he does is great. The fawning reviews of Silence are, frankly embarrassing. For a very simple reason: despite the apparent themes, there's neither true faith nor spirituality here that remotely rings true. A true Christian would not allow so many innocent people to be tortured to death for what he pretends to believe in. There's religious self-indulgence here but very little heart, very little humanism, hell, very little genuine emotion. If a project takes 30 years to be born it should perhaps be let go of. This is a stillbirth right through. There's more humanity, emotion, love, hell, even Christian attributes in Ray Liotta's character in Goodfellas than in the whole of this movie with its assorted priests and their conceits. The idea of missionaries is a peculiar form of mental health issue spawned by the church empires of the European middle ages. But this movie skirts around this issue and never bites the bullet. While I do not for a moment condone the cruelty of the Japanese as depicted here, I totally get the sanity of their reaction time these invaders who would presume to change a centuries old cultural system. And Andrew Garfield does come across as someone mentally ill, living in a world of his own, totally divorced from the physical reality he lives in, a mission without real people in it. His gawky looks are also unfortunately not suited to this sort of project. His Adam's apple has a life of its own, a very distracting thing that costuming should perhaps have taken care of. The one single most brilliant scene is when the Japanese inquisitor narrates the story of the Japanese nobleman with the four beautiful concubines who were banished for quarrelling and vying for his favour. Thus he found peace. A powerful parable of how Japan saw the various European powers trying to infiltrate Japan. Emotionally I'm with the Japanese sentiment here, and I'm as European as Scorsese is.

But this isn't like your typical Scorsese distressing and disturbing film, it feels more like it was filmed like a documentary more than an actual movie, which is extremely difficult to achieve. Scorsese said he wanted to make this around 27 years ago, but it kept getting held back by all of his other work.
This film actually comes to a point where this literally does not feel like acting, it feels like more of what would actually happen if you went on this mission. So, let's get to the story, it's about a man played by Liam Neeson called Father Ferreira, he has apparently denounced his religion in public and Fr. Rodrigues and Fr. Garrpe played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, are sent to check if this is true, then, all of a sudden, it becomes a big quest and instead of this being an easy mission, it turns into a gigantic rush.
Adam Driver's character ends up sacrificing himself to save the people they are drowning and ends up dying, which mean Rodrigues is all by himself. He ends up finding Father Ferreira and tells Sebastian the story of why he had to leave his beliefs or else he would've died.

165,DVR_Brale,Gives a deeper insight about gruelling problems Christian community faced but with personal walk in faith as well,8,25 March 2017,"This is not a standard review but rather a reflection about the movie.-------------------At first I was a little dubious about Silence. I thought it would portray Catholics in a fashionable and biased way. So to begin with, Scorsese most certainly has not done that. Both Japanese and Christians are presented in an honest and engaging way. Apart from being shot beautifully, Silence raises very difficult and important theological questions. It is not only about persecution and evangelism but intrinsic religious emotion and relationship with Christ each individual grows in in his own heart. Scorsese struggled with religion throughout his life. Silence completes his religious trilogy. He was raised as a Christian and now at the age of 75 finally makes a movie he wanted to make for 25 years. This explains why Silence is permeated with personal struggle priests encounter in their missionary work in contrast to community problems Japanese Christians face.The main question Silence raises that I have identified is the following: Can you commit apostasy and still be a faithful Christian? It's a more difficult question than I thought it was. Christ clearly said: ""But whoever disowns me before others will be disowned before the angels of God."" (Lk 12, 9) On the other side, one may even bear martyrdom for his own faith, but what if others have to bear martyrdom for *your* faith? Is it then possible to commit apostasy on the outside only for the sake of others and stay true to Christ in the inside? What about martyrs then? Would there even be a Christian faith if everybody just committed apostasy and bore Christ only within without any external sings? I don't think Silence gives you answers to this and other questions but instead it confronts you with them in an unnerving way. And that is a good thing. If you decide to watch Silence, take into account deep personal issues it develops and reflect upon them within the silence of your heart. See it with proper attitude and think about it with forbearance afterwards. You might benefit more that you think.",Silence
166,tyson-hunsaker,"An unflinching, truthful, and masterfully done historical epic.",9,14 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese's latest historical epic based on the book by the same name is not a film that's for everybody although one would believe it should be upon seeing it. It's difficult to describe Silence without giving too much away and it's hard to explain why this film experience is unique to any other an audience member might see. The story of Silence holds nothing back in portraying the two Jesuit priest's struggles in experiencing the real violence and persecution directed towards Christianity in the country of Japan. They, as well as the viewer embark on a unique and heart-wrenching journey of tested faith and personal identity and one's relationship with deity. This is back dropped by the film's title Silence as the viewer experiences something every human could possibly feel strongly about: God's seeming silence during trials. This films takes you on a special spiritual, emotional, and intellectual quest that the average movie goer is bound to not expect. The film is constructed quite perfectly; something to be expected from a master filmmaker like Scorsese. The editing is constructed perfectly and the movie is shot beautifully. Not just because of the filming location but it's obvious Wolf of Wall Street cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto took delicate and special care to every single shot of this masterpiece. This all being stated, as said before, the film isn't for everyone; especially the every day movie- goer looking for a ""good time at the movies."" This isn't a ""good time"" but rather a slow, thought- provoking journey that will require everything out of those who participate in it. This also isn't a film for those who don't enjoy anything religion (especially related to Christ) seeing as how the entire script is filled with it. That's not to say however, that anyone can't enjoy this film but seeing as how it's such a difficult film to muscle through given the subject matter and gut- wrenching content this film is for those who know they'll appreciate it and are prepared to be challenged in ways they might not be so comfortable with. Overall, this film is incredible and should be seen by anyone who loves cinema and wants to know more about great filmmaking. However, it's not for those who are looking for a ""feel good"" religious movie or an adventure to Japan that'll light you up like Dances with Wolves. Be prepared for a heavy experience that'll challenge and enthrall you to the very end.",Silence
167,trevor-82944,A Cry Louder Than Anything Anyone Saw Coming,7,20 January 2017,"I never thought I'd see the famous Martin Scorsese spend two decades working on a retelling of 17th century priests spreading Christianity in a country that forbade it, but by George he's done it! It still misses the intended level of perfection, but Silence reminds us of one important philosophy: We have no need to suffer while spreading the word of our beliefs, as God always speaks through silence.Scorsese grips us into the uncomfortable experience with the torture of several Christians, only a handful of thousands others facing the same fate. They are tied to crosses far away from their village, and the Japanese authorities slowly pour water directly from the hot springs onto their bare flesh. One of these Christian missionaries, portrayed by Liam Neeson (Michael Collins, Schindler's List), provides a voice-over that sounds like the mouth of God. Things may look hopeless from his perspective, but less than three hours later we learn of the Lord's consistent activity in their trials, despite His apparent silence.Two new American priests, depicted by Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge, The Social Network) and Adam Driver (Girls, Star Wars: The Force Awakens) set out on a life-or-death mission of ministry to the ruthless city of Nagasaki, Japan. Here, anyone committed to Christianity must hide in the wilderness, or else be forced by governmental rule to place their foot over a stone image of Christ against their will. Other forms of persecution includes burning at the stake and hanging on a cross over crashing waves, ensuring a slow and excruciating death. Despite the stunning, picturesque camera-work by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Brokeback Mountain, The Wolf of Wall Street), the unholy conditions of this God-created land turns back onto his people. It makes you question: Where is God in moments of silence?The cast who recreates these events put on at best average performances, depending on how much creative juices director Scorsese pours into the particular scene. Yet top priority goes to the creative storytelling, even over the depth of the acting and characterizations. The two leads could not be more miscast, while nobody in the supporting cast has enough written detail to make you care for their predicament. For instance, one of the key characters gets killed after we don't see him for an hour, and then nobody ever mentions him again, almost as if he was never at any point necessary for the priests' mission. I'd also like to note a rather bizarre out-of-place moment when the priest played by Garfield looks into the water and sees his reflection as the painting of an apostle. He laughs at his distorted reflection as if he's had too much wine or something. It's a moment which you're not sure about how you're supposed to feel while watching, so you just cringe in an uncomfortable silence.The blaring errors aside, Mr. Scorsese's latest effort stands out from his others, as here there are no profound levels of cursing and violence, and no excessive love towards old filmmaking. In fact, he and his regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker (Goodfellas, Raging Bull) step back from his widely celebrated abrupt edit patterns, and instead keeps the pace as slow as possible to honor whomever suffered so much under God's supervision. No accompanying musical score to lend an ear to either—in fact, the sound mixing ranges from minimal to absent, depending on how much we can hear God speak through silence.Unlike others before it, this motion picture explores an unfamiliar place and time in history in an informative approach. It makes it easy to quickly parallel this account to the present-day worldwide desire to freely believe whatever without facing either hatred or persecution. If you were to watch these horrific trials placed on the faithful, a reminder should erupt within you of the everlasting hatred plaguing our world, yet another will erupt of hope for those evangelical souls not afraid to speak.",Silence

Never did and still doesn't appeal to me.For the time being anyway.

169,kinolieber,"Unapologetic story of faith, conversion and martyrdom",5,2 February 2017,"SILENCE is beautifully filmed and strangely involving for such a grim and slow-moving tale. For a 2 hr 40 min movie, I never felt bored or felt that the story was unnecessarily stretched out. As an ex Catholic who, as a child, was intrigued by the idea of martyrdom and by tales of the saints who were killed because they refused to renounce their faith (and so, got an express ticket to heaven - a very attractive end result for one who feared hell as much as I did), I could identify in a more distanced way with the protagonists and their Catholic followers in Japan. I expected that in telling a story set 400 years ago, Scorsese would provide some kind of modern day insight (psychological, political,sexual) to the true events depicted in his narrative. Instead, all I could glean was that this was a film by a devout Catholic, about devout Catholics. Who would have thought Scorsese was possessed by such primal and dogmatic religious feelings? Shockingly, the Japanese culture is referred to more than once as a 'swamp' where nothing truly spiritual, much less Catholic, can grow. The inquisitor who persecutes the Catholics is portrayed by a lizardy actor with a high pitched voice, doing what I guess is the Japanese equivalent of a moustache-twirling villain. Cruelty, execution and torture take up a large part of the picture, and while accurate I suppose, is probably no worse that what was done by the Catholic inquisition in Europe. I was hoping for some kind of statement about religious fanaticism, and at one point, when a Buddhist is trying to reason with the priest, asking why it isn't better to focus on the common elements of the world's different religions, I thought the film was going in that direction. But it ends on an 'upbeat' religious note, when it is revealed that the priest held onto his faith in the Catholic god right up to the end. The film was premiered at The Vatican which says a lot about where it's coming from. There is a dedication to the priests and converts in Japan. I wasn't impressed by Andrew Garfield in the central role. I felt like he was miscast, so it's mostly not his fault - too young and modern (and who kept his hair so coiffed in the first half of the movie?). Adam Driver was excellent as always, but not sure why he felt he needed to lose all that weight for the role, he was really skinny and sunken-eyed. Liam Neeson, also miscast with his very tall stature and hard-to- disguise Irishness was good in a thankless role. The Japanese actors (except for the inquisitor) were fine, but most of their characters were never really developed into anything more than simple-minded worshippers or cruel torturers.",Silence
170,NDbportmanfan,Riveting Adaption from the Award Winning Novel,8,26 January 2017,"The film primarily takes place in 17th century Japan. During that time the country tried to block all foreign cultures/religions as leaders believed their people were being heavily influenced by foreigners. Silence is about two Jesuit priests who decide to go to Japan to rescue their mentor, who was captured and tortured for practicing Christianity.Having read the novel, I thought this was a well done adaption that captured most of the themes the book was trying to tell. Scorsese was able to show us the brutality people went though for believing in something other than what the state wanted as well as the courage and strength of the citizens and priests. The only real thing that I thought should have been included in this almost three hour movie was some scenes of Japan's religion/culture. The movie focused a little heavy on the Christian side and how it was not welcome. I would have appreciated seeing a couple of scenes featuring Buddhist or Shinto beliefs, so the audience could see the differences and similarities between the two. The costumes and scenes are just visually beautiful. At least this part was recognized by the academy as it is well deserved. Garfield was tremendous as Rodrigues. He was able to convey the emotions necessary to enhance their impact. Driver's scenes were a little hit or miss as some of his lines would take me out of the moment. Neeson always seems to give a solid performance and this one was no different. Other notable performances that left a lasting impression had to be Issei Ogata as Inoue. As I watched his character reminded me of Col. Hans Landa from Inglorious Bastards as he was in full control of every scene he had a part. He just had that way about him that draws you.Well if you couldn't have guessed from my previous statements this movie's story is heavily focused on religion so if those type of movies make you uncomfortable then this is probably not the movie for you. If not then this is a wonderful story that shouldn't be missed.",Silence
171,jcjs333,Grueling,1,4 April 2017,"I liked, immensely, Quo Vadis, the Robe, Salmson and Delhila, Last Temptation of Christ (great Scorcese movie)...Passion of Christ and Silence was a romp in blood, torture and tedious long movies by 2 struggling Catholics trying to find their way. No mention in this movie about 'The Inquisition(s)by the Catholic Church. The attention to the costumes, language, land and Japanese culture was wonderful but the tedious length of the movie and 2hrs 40minutes of torture and philosophical mumbo jumbo is too much. Trite is the one word that comes to mind. Liam Neeson wasn't in the film but a few minutes and beginning and end and he was poorly cast and didn't pull off the role he was playing. I think this is the worst show Scorcese has done and i see no reason for a high rating. Christianity, as of 2010 is the largest religion in the world but it doesn't mean it's the best. There are so many Catholic clergy trying to spread the word to the defenseless, gullible people no wonder it's Christianity is the largest. In the USA 50% are Christian and 50% of Christians are Catholic. Neeson's statements about the Japanese believing the actual sun was believed to be the Son of God is specious and , if so , so what. That is no reason to go into a Buddhist culture and pressure them to see your way. Those or just philosophical statements referring to Silence. But, the main dislike for this show is the needless, constant, boring, ho hum torturing during the whole show. Gibson and Scorcese like blood a flowing. I think Mel Gibson was brutally beaten within an inch of his life and i think Passion of Christ was his way of alleviating some of the pain of the past. I agree with another critic here that the show would , most likely , never be made if it weren't for the famous director. I don't understand people's rating this high.",Silence

This is fine acting by Mr Garfield. I hadn't realised he was English, as he's played American characters in the films I've seen him in.I was't aware of the history; yet another religion preaching and forcing its beliefs on others, this time it's in Japan.

176,archiecm,Minority (Atheist) Report: A Fool's Errand,10,23 January 2017,"This reaction to ""Silence"" is from the perspective of an atheist. And my attitude throughout the film was influenced by my knowledge of the novel Shogun. In that book the Japanese were distrustful of European influence and infiltration. They knew or suspected that the first step towards outside dominance starts with the innocent-seeming proselytizers of ""the Word."" By today's view ""historians now describe missionaries as arrogant and rapacious imperialists. Christianity became not a saving grace but a monolithic and aggressive force that missionaries imposed upon defiant natives. Indeed, missionaries were now understood as important agents in the ever-expanding nation-state, or ""ideological shock troops for colonial invasion whose zealotry blinded them."" (Quoted from Google) The church gets mistreated or brutalized and the foreign country sends in the army. Some examples of this are South America: they all speak Spanish (or Portuguese) and are ruled by European descendants; Parts of Africa have the same history. There's India where it partly happened, and Australia. Perhaps Japan knew or suspected such an outcome as well. So I wasn't all that sympathetic to the two missionaries of this story. Plus their whole point of view was that they had the ""Truth"". There are thousands of religions that all claim the same thing. What makes the Western Christian version the REAL Truth? Nothing. It depends on where you were raised. That they all think they have the answer convinces me that none do. But it also convinces me that Man must invent some story, some explanation of why he's here, how he got here, and how he's supposed to act. I guess we'd be lost without such a backdrop. The other apes (chimpanzees, gorillas and such) don't seem to need that. Their ""God"" is the alpha male of their band. For homo sapiens that would be a king but we seem to need more than that. So we have one who resides above the clouds. But the clouds are below us as well since the world is round so exactly where would we point to locate this Super King? You can't point everywhere so that's another reason why I'm convinced there is no Super King. All this makes the journey of Fathers Rodrigues and Garupe somewhat pathetic and somewhat tiresome. Missionaries remind me of Jehovah's Witnesses who go around (KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK) waking up nurses and other folks who work nights wanting to know, ""Can we come inside and pray with you?"" (""Cuz we have the answer, the one and only answer."") I suppose this message was an improvement on cultures where there was out and out cannibalism but beyond that it was and is an intrusion. Still, the torture and murder was extreme and hard to watch. But one reviewer pointed out that Scorsese neglected to show that in Spain and Portugal at that very time there was an Inquisition going on with equal cruelty and murder towards Jews and Protestants. I therefore celebrated the entrance of the former Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). He took righteousness out of the equation and just tried to fulfill a need he saw. And he seemed to come by that wisdom the hard way – discovering that nothing else worked or made any sense. So I liked the outcome reached by Father Rodrigues. Just as an afterthought, did anyone besides me notice that all that praying brought about no results, except internally (and then only in certain cases)? Did anyone else get the idea that no one is listening? Anyway, I loved the ocean post card scenery. And I liked being plopped down in an earlier time in history. I liked the film somehow.",Silence

The Jesuit can endure torture and a horrible death for the sake of his Savior but can he endure the terrible suffering of the innocent whose agonies are prolonged due to his unyielding faith in his God....or is it a misplaced need for establishing a church in an alien land....or even a reflection of unconscious spiritual pride amid the honest weakness of the ""apostasizers?"" The inquisitor asks for an overt rejection of the Christian God by the imprisoned Jesuit whose journey to Japan was prompted by news of an earlier missionary's apostasy (renunciation of the faith). The Jesuit along with another priest have made the perilous journey for the salvation of the apostate's soul and to renew the missionary effort. Will he succumb to the same terrible dilemmas as tortured the apostate's?Scorsese's film is replete with religious and psychological themes that haunt us. What is the meaning of suffering; can we allow others to suffer to demonstrate (or confirm to ourselves?) our boundless faith; does faith supersede all other human criteria at all times; can love of God be separated from love of man; whose ""truth"" prevails: the Christian ""truth"" in a Buddhist land, or the Buddhist ""truth"" amid Christian interlopers? I'm reminded that Mother Teresa, who did holy work amid the poor and dying of Calcutta, has been criticized for not allowing painkillers to be given to the suffering and dying in her care, because suffering, in her judgment, was spiritually good for them. While that may indeed be right, is that her decision to make?Part of the power of the church's appeal, and part of the theological problems with the nature of that appeal, is the ordinary person's amazement and respect for the amount of agonies the church's ""holiest"" representatives will endure to substantiate their faith. While briefly touched upon in ""Silence,"" and not remotely on the same level as martyrdom, I'm reminded that some historians have commented that the clerical power of the Roman Catholic Church is reinforced by priestly celibacy, i.e., these men are stronger than us, they can subdue their bodily appetites unlike the rest of us.",Silence

180,littleging12,A Jarring and Challenging Experience,8,4 February 2017,"Martin Scorsese's poetic passion project might be the greatest rendering of the human spirit in the last decade. The film explores faith, spirituality, love, betrayal, doubt and one's unyielding conviction to remain true to his beliefs. This film is not a typical box-office smasher because of its harsh subject matter and deeply rooted religious themes. However, it is still a powerful piece of cinema with phenomenal acting, and mind boggling religious actions, revelations and interpretations.The story follows two Jesuit priests and their quest to promote Christianity while trying to locate their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who, according to rumors, 'surrendered the faith.' They travel to the barren 'swamp' of Japan where Christianity is outlawed, punishable by death. The priests endure hell through spiritual, psychological, and physical torment. They face starvation, persecution, and poor living conditions on top of doubting their own beliefs about whether God is even listening to them or if God exists at all. The film explores these themes with an open mind that could support or refute the notion of God's presence in the film. Scorsese treats the material with somber respect, ambiguity, and superb technical skill.To match the gravity of the religious themes and seriousness of the film is the fantastic acting, writing, cinematography, and directing. The previously mentioned are all great and should have all gotten Oscar nominations. How they didn't is truly a sin. Andrew Garfield kills it with another emotionally powerful performance. His performance carries the movie even during boring parts. It shows lots of similarity to his performance in ""Hacksaw Ridge"" in how he plays a faithful man not willing to renounce his beliefs. Adam Driver was pretty good as well, though not on the same level as Andrew Garfield. Liam Neeson also delivers a morally complex performance that makes up for all his throwaway action movie roles. The Japanese actors especially the ones who played Inoue and Kichijiro were also very convincing yet it was hard to make out exactly what they were saying at times. This made it somewhat hard to get the full scope of what they were talking about in each given scene.*Spoilers and Sermonizing begin here* During the obligatory finale of Father Rodrigues' (Andrew Garfield) trial, he is faced with the heart wrenching choice of either denouncing God by trampling on a picture of Christ or remaining faithful which would lead to innocent Japanese Christians being tortured to death. Through persuasion of Father Ferreira's claims to denounce God and by presumably hearing God's voice telling him to trample on the image, Father Rodrigues tramples on the image of Christ. In doing so he saves Christian lives and ends up living a life of silent disposition towards the faith. He takes a Japanese name, job, and helps the elite find religious objects in the country to destroy.Now some may think that Father Rodrigues is a hero due to the fact that he publicly, yet maybe not privately, denounced God to save the lives of others. But according to the Catholic Church's teaching, committing an evil act (apostatizing) never justifies a good result (saving tortured Christians). But perhaps under the strenuous circumstances Father Rodrigues may have been pardoned especially since he heard the 'Voice of God.' But was that really God? Couldn't that have been his own insanity or maybe even the Devil's voice? Because would God really give contradictory instructions to apostatize after so many people had died already in the name of the faith. Father Rodrigues' denunciation resembles Saint Peter's with the cock crowing but unlike Saint Peter, Rodrigues never sought repentance. Although the very last image of the movie, in which Rodrigues is holding a tiny cross, helped mitigate his apostasy because it symbolized that his faith had never died and he practiced his faith in silence. Yet the faith is not something you practice internally. It's something you practiced externally with others. And what better way to externally share your faith then to openly die for it. *Spoilers and Sermonizing end here*""Silence"" is an important film although it may not necessarily abide by Church teaching, it certainly gives Christians and maybe other religions things to ponder and reflect on to help them understand the moral boundaries of their faith. However, it can also be a dangerous film for general audiences because they may leave the film thinking that the actions displayed by Father Rodrigues are justifiable, and that religion is something that should be privatized in silence.",Silence

Impressive images are shown as well. The movie also takes the necessary time to let what is shown take effect. As a consequence, the pace is correspondingly slow.

183,artmania90,Will take some time to process,8,16 January 2017,"There's a reasonable argument to say that SILENCE is one of Martin Scorsese's better movies. The talk is that it was a passion project of his for decades, finally being released in all it's artistic endeavors and mysteries. I suppose someone else could argue the opposite: that this is a story full of brutality and despair without the signature style of the aged director. I think I'm falling right on the middle on this one. This is surely one of the year's most powerful stories, and yet I have to admit it left me cold.The story follows two priests from Portugal (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who venture into hostile Japanese country in search of their mentor, Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson), who has abandoned his Christian faith. Some chalk it up to mere rumors. These two young ministers take the journey to find out for themselves.What begins as a fairly traditional story ventures into the heart of Japan in the 16th Century with a sharp attention to both detail and horror. This is less a story of a search for one man as it is an odyssey into the despair found in conflicting religious beliefs. Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) holds hope that Ferreira is alive while also working to convert as many locals under cover of darkness. Upon landing on the shores of Japan (smuggled in on small fishing boats from China), he encounters villages of faithful Christians who worship in secret. For them, the arrival of Rodrigues and Father Garupe (Driver) is confirmation of their beliefs. Through language barriers, it seems that God is always present.As we delve further into the country towards Nagasaki (where Ferreira is said to be held), the two priest break off on separate journeys. Rodrigues, though oftentimes alone, is shadowed by a Japanese recluse named Kichijiro, a drunk who once betrayed his faith in order to spare his life (he witnessed the execution of his entire family) but returns to the faith time again in order to make Confession and amends with the Lord. Rodrigues continues to absolve him, and yet this is the slow unraveling of an aspect of this story: do the Japanese really comprehend the religion in the same way Westerners do?There are three people who make this movie better than average: Andrew Garfield surely gives one of the year's best performances as a man trapped in his own personal Hell, forced to grapple between martyrdom and eternal damnation. It's a strong year for Garfield, getting accolades and Oscar buzz for his other leading role in 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Trust me, this is the better performance. Second is the skill of Martin Scorsese, who slowly paints a portrait of a time long forgot with such attention to tone. It's a horrifying and at times morbid story to sit through, but there was never a moment I found myself any less than fully-focused and contemplative.Third is a surprise, a breakthrough performance by a Japanese actor named Issey Ogata who gives without a doubt one of the year's most memorable performances. Throughout the film the Christians living in Japan are routinely inspected by samurai officials who intend to hunt down and capture any found citizens in violation of the law. One such official is Inoue Masashige (Ogata) who treats the job with a certain flair. Constantly waving a fan and with an ear to ear smile, this is a performance that steps above the rest of the cast by perfectly encapsulating the braggadocious nature of Japanese law without missing a beat. It's a winking devil performance that I hope the Oscars won't look over.'Silence' is at times hard to palpate and yet rewards the audience for it's patience. Whether or not this film can be interpreted as being pro or anti-Catholic is maybe not the ultimate message of this film. While the final act delves into a horrifyingly-dark arena, consider the final shot before the credits begin to role (I won't spoil it). In such a brutal era with antiquated customs, isn't there still hope left to be found?",Silence
184,CtlAltDel,Disappointing,6,27 April 2020,"Overly long, ponderous, terribly miss cast and not amounting to very much, for me, SILENCE was instantly forgotten the moment the film ended. I realise I'm supposed to fall on the floor in a dribbling mess at the genius of Scorsese but this film (like quite a few in his oeuvre) didn't do it for me. It was no BLACK ROBE or THE MISSION, films which haunt years later.",Silence
185,ravenus,Not quite the Last Temptation,7,24 November 2019,"For anyone that doesn't know, Silence looks at the struggle of Christian missionaries in 17th Century Japan and the actions of Japanese officialdom to root out the foreign religion. The film is seen primarily through the eyes of Rodriguez (everybody's favorite Catholic Andrew Garfield), who undergoes repeated crises of faith when he is asked to renounce his God with the threat of having his followers tortured.
It's a story with a lot of potential and to be sure there are several interesting moments (especially when the characters discuss the relevance of Christianity in Japanese culture) and some terrific shoreline imagery, but I didn't feel as successfully involved with it. While it may be historically true I felt the Japanese officials were came across as caricature villains - it didn't help that Issey Ogata as the Inoue (governor?) sounded like a cross between Kenneth Williams of the Carry On series and Yoda. Also, Rodriguez's visions and messages from Jesus were very on-the-nose and cheapened the experience for me.
So I think I'll stick with Last Temptation of Christ, so far as Marty's religious filmography goes.",Silence
186,i_ianchev,"Always beside you, never silent",10,30 January 2017,"It took me some time to comment on my most anticipated film of the year - ""Silence"", by Martin Scorsese, but it was worth it...The central notion of spirituality and human nature is the very essence of faith in this masterpiece by Mr. Scorsese.We see two Jesuit priests (Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield) going on a journey in peril. The aim - to find their mentor - Father Ferreira, who has renounced his faith after being tortured in Japan.St. Paul's college in Macau is indeed a symbolical building to marvel at. It emphasizes on the transience of an era of devout, dogmatic Christianity. But still, its facade exhibits the magnificence of the human spirit. And how faith can travel and conquer, but also stay and change, transform any place in the world.There is a really nice poem called ""Footprints in the sand"". It speaks volumes of the Christian faith, and to that matter - volumes of any faith, which is righteous. It goes like this:""One night I dreamed a dream. As I was walking along the beach with my Lord. Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my life. For each scene, I noticed two sets of footprints in the sand, One belonging to me and one to my Lord.After the last scene of my life flashed before me, I looked back at the footprints in the sand. I noticed that at many times along the path of my life, especially at the very lowest and saddest times, there was only one set of footprints.This really troubled me, so I asked the Lord about it. ""Lord, you said once I decided to follow you, You'd walk with me all the way. But I noticed that during the saddest and most troublesome times of my life, there was only one set of footprints. I don't understand why, when I needed You the most, You would leave me.""He whispered, ""My precious child, I love you and will never leave you Never, ever, during your trials and testings. When you saw only one set of footprints, It was then that I carried you.""This is very much what to my account this movie is about. The hidden treasures of faith lie within our own understanding of life and its meaning. In ""Silence"" not all questions of father Rodrigues are answered, as nor do all of our delusions meet their end throughout our lives. But we all witness the pain and torture which the great ensemble of characters endure. Here, I must really praise the directorial work and all the actors' incredible performances. We must emphasize that all characters - from the main one to the smallest and most episodic ones - are represented truly and faithfully.We see Japan and the Japanese way of life as it is. Nothing is spared, nothing is hidden. Nature itself is a major character in this movie. It is no coincidence that ""Silence"" was nominated only for Cinematography for the annual Academy awards - perhaps this is the most incredible part of the film. I cannot explain enough how the visuals speak volumes of storytelling to the viewer. We are engulfed in the sounds and colors of this magical godly realm called Earth. You must truly experience this both beautiful and disturbing nature of the movie.The screenplay twists and turns around us and our expectations. We feel our own doubts and remorse, we live the same life deeply within is and at the end of the journey we feel maybe a bit better about out choices in life. Not because the film gives a final solution, or because it pretends to be a parable. This monumental work from Mr. Scorsese about how the human spirituality works is a fine example of storytelling through introduction of a riveting internal dialogue within each and every viewer.I myself feel the need to share this film with everybody that cares for cinema, spirituality and purpose in life. It is a shining example of a perfect movie experience and a carefully paved way to self discovery.",Silence

188,andrewfleming-57891,Interesting and educational,7,22 August 2018,"Silence is a very unique and interesting examination of the history of Christian priests in Japan. The film is extremely long and at times the plot drags. The actors also add very little to their roles. Andrew Garfield does not feel comfortable in his role and Liam Neeson is given too little time to make an impression. However, the film is excellently made. There are some very moving scenes, that hang in the back of the viewers mind all through the film, particularly the crucifixion and drowning scenes. However, far too much of the film relies heavily on voice over narration, including the voice at the end who is not given an identity. The end of the film is very disappointing. After two hours of build up, Neeson and Garfield finally meet and in the end Garfield apostates and lives with the Japanese for the rest of his life. These scenes should be given more time as they are the most important part of the film. The final shot is also unnecessary as it is unlikely that Garfield would have been able to hideba cross for so many years. It destroys the whole films integrity and realism. This film is worth a watch as it is a completely different piece of work from Scorcese. However, in the end it prooves that he should stick to his usual works. It is still very interesting tough, but defnitey too long. 7/10",Silence

Its a movie that questions how faith should be put into practice and those difficult moments when hard decisions are needed. The closing scene will have you crying. There is also incredible cinematography in the movie. If you are not catholic or religious its a good history lesson to many who don't know about the slaughter of thousands of Christians in japan.

191,JoshuaMLosapio,A Visually Stunning Yet Drawn Out Passion Project,8,2 September 2019,"I've seen Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" twice: once in the theater and once on home video. My first viewing was a transcendent experience, but my second was a disappointment. What I first loved about the film remains great, but multiple viewings highlight the movie's imperfections. ""Silence"" is a beautifully made epic with awe-inspiring performances and important religious themes - but those qualities are stretched thin over a nearly three hour running time.""Silence"" is a spiritual successor to ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" Scorsese's controversial life of Jesus that divided believers but nonetheless managed to get to the heart of the often challenging experience of being a Christian. Since then Scorsese has matured as a filmmaker and with a bigger budget he was able to re-address Catholic themes with an even better cast and an expanded scope. Scorsese is a master director and in ""Silence"" he sets a thought-provoking discussion about faith against the colorful backdrop of 17th Century Japan. The questions Scorsese raises are the defining ones of his career: what does it really mean to be a Christian? How far can we take forgiveness of sins? Is it possible to renounce God in action but still love him?""The Last Temptation of Christ"" had clearer answers to these questions in a film that better utilized its sprawling length and poetic imagery. ""Silence"" holds up as a moving exploration of religion and belief, but it suffers from tortuously slow pacing and a drawn out third act that fails as pay off for two hours of build-up. I read the original book ""Silence"" when I was in high school, and unfortunately the literary version is superior to the film: the ponderous and bleak story of ""Silence"" is better fit for a novel than cinema. I do recommend Scorsese's ""Silence"" for the amazing visuals, provocative themes, and superb performances - in particular Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson shine in their respective roles. But be prepared for a film that's nearly an hour too long. 8/10.",Silence

This movie is 2 hours and 41 minute, as most of Scorsese movies are long I have never had an issue with any of them in fact as in the Godfather series I wanted them to be longer, each scene had something different to contribute to the plot and progressed perfectly to the end. Intro,char development, climax, closing. In Silence it was Intro,char development, then about 40 minutes of more char development that was repetitive to the point you loose interest and become desensitized. Then it finally hits climax and the close is about 5 minutes too long.So in the opinion of this avid movie goer of all types of movies, I gave this movie a 6 and more then likely would have been a 7 maybe 8 had the editor done his job and cut about 45 minutes from the film.",Silence

However, since this movie deals with faith and spirituality I'm gonna talk about it so suck it up I guess. This film depicts real Christian persecution, it's not the kind of fake persecution you get in those terrible Pureflix movies. This film depicts Christian persecution in 17th century feudal Japan. The film has a lot of great performances from everybody involved including Liam Neeson and Andrew Garfield. Personally as a lapsed Protestant, I think that secular and religious people can coexist together, after all at the end of the day we're all human and we can find a common ground even if we disagree on religious matters. And I would go a step further and say this: you don't need to be religious to be a decent human being you just need to have compassion and empathy for your fellow man but I digress.

195,doxxman5,life will constantly force you to lose your way,8,22 March 2017,"Silence plays like a religious version of Apocalypse Now, with Liam Neeson being the Marlon Brando type who is stranded in a foreign land and lost his way. Two Jesuit Priests are sent to find him, and the tests and trails of their missionary are a brutal sight to behold. It is a story of persecution, of foreign invaders, of stubbornness and strength of will, and these traits are present with the majority of Scorsese's movies. Scorsese has approached religion in his films before, most notably Jesus Christ in the Last Temptation and the Dali Lama in Kundun, but Silence is his best stab at it because it shows not a crisis of faith but how life will constantly force you to lose your way, going from an innocent and naïve state to a full on corrupt one.

And even though Martin Scorsese did most of the job to make this movie to be beyond great,nothing could had been possible without Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver but mostly without Andrew Garfield.For me,Andrew Garfield is one of the greatest actors form Hollywood and,in time he will surely won an Oscar for another movie that he will gonna play in but until then,he can be proud of himself that he played in two amazing movies based on a true story:Silence and Hacksaw Rdige.Not to mention that thanks to the movie,Hacksaw Ridge,Andrew Garfield proved us that he is indeed a great actor and that he's not just the guy who played Spider-Man,he can play in great movies too but only if the company and the directors of those movies know how to appreciate Andrew Garfield's talent.Sony didn't do that and for that,The Amazing Spider-Man franchise is seen as a failure by most of the fans.Anyway,overall Silence is an indisputably worthy film from one of our greatest living directors, one that searchingly tackles questions of faith and doubt and duty.",Silence
198,Ben_Cap,"A Long, Long, Long, Long, Long Masterpiece.",8,15 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese has been trying to make Silence for over 25 years, to call it a passion project does not do it justice. It was while riding a bullet train from Tokyo to Kyoto on the way to film a cameo in an Akira Kurosawa movie that Scorsese finished the book that his movie would be based on. All of this shortly after he had finished one of his if not his most controversial movie The Last Temptation of Christ. Since then Silence has been through all types of development hell, constantly being pushed back by movies like Gangs of New York, The Avaitor, Shutter Island and The Departed. It was once set to star Daniel Day-Lewis, Benicio del Toro, and Gael García Bernal which just makes me all types of sad that we did not get to see that movie. Silence is finally here, from that 1989 trip to Japan to 2017, Scorsese has gotten to make his ""passion project"" and he has put all he has into it, the good and the bad of the genius that is Martin Scorsese.The story is about two Portuguese Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) who learn that their teacher, Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Liam Neeson) has publicly renounced his faith in public in Japan. The two priests cannot believe such news and travel to Japan to find Father Ferreira and prove that this news is false. Christianity has been outlawed in Japan and is investigated and eliminated by a man called ""the inquisitor"". Upon arriving in Japan, both men are shown how horribly Christians are treated there and go through bouts of lost faith. The movie is very well written, other than the length of the movie which I will get into later. For being such a long movie about a seemingly a bit dull topic these days, it moves very well. Other than a few key scenes the movie is always moving forward, but this is not only because of the writing.Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of his generation, if not all time. His movies have influences countless others and pushed the idea of what movies could be. The master does not slip up in Silence where he puts some of his best work in recent years. The Wolf of Wall Street was incredibly made, but I think Silence is a step ahead when it comes to Scorsese's directing. The movie is presented beautifully, and then we are treated to some astonishingly difficult to watch scenes. There is a level of realism that can only be attained by the best, you are drawn into this world and once you are let out you wont be able to get your mind off it. Scorsese has also always been a director who gets amazing performances out of his actors and Silence is no exception.If there was an acting award that could be given to the cast of a movie as a whole my vote would be for it to go to Silence. Not only is Andrew Garfield putting up the best performance of his career, not only is Adam Driver a strong supporting actor but there were countless Japanese actors in Silence that were absolutely fantastic. Tadanobu Asano as the Japanese interpreter, Yōsuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro and Issey Ogata as Inoue Masashige all play key roles and play the hell out of them. This movie is packed full of emotion from some characters, but others take the events with a level of normalcy that must have been difficult to perform as well.My biggest complaint with Silence is the length. 2 hours and 41 minutes is ridiculously long, and I know Mr. Scorsese has earned the right to make his movies as long as he wants, but this movie would surely have been a 9 out of 10 if it were about 20 minutes shorter. Other than that Silence is an incredibly made movie, and maybe the best piece of cinema from 2016. The massive length also kind of adds into the mystique of the movie, and while I found my time to move fairly fast I can see others struggling through it. Silence is also not an easy watch because of some of the intense scenes involving torture, but these were both not very graphically violent and very necessary. Would this movie be better if it had been made in 2009 with del Toro, Bernal and Daniel Day-Lewis I do not know. What I do know is that this one is an amazing movie and a must see for any fan of cinema.",Silence
199,stock-1,a 2 hour and 40 minutes swamp ride,5,21 January 2017,"Shusaku Endo was a Japanese author who wrote from the rare perspective of a Japanese Roman Catholic. He often likened Japan to a swamp or fen. In the novel Silence, an official tells a priest who has apostatized, ""Father, it was not by us that you were defeated, but by this mud swamp, Japan."" One wonders how a native Japanese man could think this way of his own country. Maybe Endo was not a Japanese at all, but a plant from China trying to spread the seeds of Cultural Marxism. As you know everything goes with the Communists, Buddhism, Paganism, Judaism, everything is fine, except that one religion which is Christianity. It must have been a treasure trove find for Scorsese, this book by Endo, to finally direct a movie which puts Christianity away as a religion for fools only. What else can one expect from a movie director whose genre has seen so much cruelty and violence. But the worst of it is that the Chinese -- who are currently reportedly on the brink of purchasing all of the remaining Hollywood Movie production houses in one swoop -- seem to have the last of the remaining Irish Catholic actors, Liam Neeson, lined inside their pockets as well, ironically in the same way as depicted inside Scorsese's Silence. The 2 hour and 40 minute sit through is not only a disgrace for Christ but for Japan as well. Maybe it's time for the Christian Knights to gird up their loins and ride again to rid humanity from this evil filth for all times to come.",Silence
200,PrashunChakraborty,A spiritual journey,9,4 March 2017,"Fantastic stuff by Scorsese again. Just downright beautifully shot, excellent direction and beautiful cinematography and very compelling. Lately I have been struggling to connect with modern day Hollywood films, whether it be La La Land, Manchester by the sea, Moonlight etc. Arrival got closest to making me care for the protagonist but not enough. I was never satisfied with my emotional connect to any or all of the characters of the said films. Silence showed me that I could care, I felt strong emotional bonds with almost all of the characters in the film, directed by the steady and unwavering hand of Martin Scorsese whose direction is the real star in the film. The rest do a decent job, Andrew Garfield gives career best performance here and is trying very hard but still not good enough to shoulder this movie on his own and there are a lot of solo scenes and his performance was good but not great. I could see a lot of parallels between this and Scorsese's Last Temptation of the Christ, like Garfield's Sebastian saw himself as Jesus figure of sorts, the ideology of pain and suffering brings you closer to god and similar moral dilemmas whether faith is more important than people's lives, a very emotional and spiritual experience throughout.Even Scorsese's greatest hits B side film is better than every film of last year. It's a shame that this was not nominated, it's not only a good film but a memorable one, it's no Seventh Seal but Scorsese doesn't ape Bergman he asks different questions and while not as philosophical but it still has a place in the pantheon of religion and spirituality based cinema something which the recent Noah just failed to do, always a very hard subject. It's amazing how Scorsese is able to maintain this level at 74, outdoing every one of his much younger peers, I hope he lives a long healthy life and continues providing us with good cinema, 2016 was in my recent memory one of the weakest years of non commercial Hollywood cinema almost SAVED by Scorsese. 8.5/10.",Silence

202,jacabiya,Contrary to the Catholic faith,2,22 June 2017,"For a brought-up or actual Catholic, Scorsese shows he has little knowledge of the Catholic faith. The goal is Heaven: it is worth suffering in this Earth, since this life is nothing compared to the next life. So why would Jesus – never mind Ferreira - tell Rodrigues to deny Him in order to prevent the Japanese Christians from suffering? That suffering would have made them martyrs and assured their eternal life. Instead the priest saved their lives but many may have ended losing their souls. And for argument's sake, maybe Rodrigues thought they did not actually have faith in Christ, but how did he know for sure? A bigger question that I'm sure has been explored elsewhere and is barely touched in this film is why if Jesus Christ brought salvation to all men on Earth it is so difficult still to this date for the Japanese to be saved by Christ.",Silence

In her writings Mother Theresa speaks of God talking to her about becoming a sister of the poor: ""You are I know the most incapable person, weak and sinful, but just because you are that I want to use you, For My Glory! Wilt thou refuse?"". Scorsese's struggle with his cultural heritage – all its imprinted Catholicism – made him become a parody of himself; incapable and unfit to direct ""Silence"" (2016). This film comes with a sense of a void, it has an awful emptiness, woefully filled of sentimental Christian mysticisms. A sellout of everyone's neighbor love, a benedictus from the Catholic Church. If there was anything at all in the film, it made me discover Masahiro Shinoda's ""Silence"" (1971 - Original title: Chinmoku), a much more eloquent, impressive movie. The once 46 years young Scorsese came under criticism from bigoted Christians over ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (1988)... what Pope Francis thinks about today's venerable Scorsese's missionary Silence I don't know, but to me it seems this Hollywood was made only ""For the greater Glory of God"".",Silence
204,nathannicolarobertscouk,Silence so often succeeds but its runtime is a huge weakness too difficult to ignore,8,11 January 2017,"Silence is an admirable piece of film-making that will, for many, demonstrate exactly what Martin Scorsese is at the very top of his field and why Andrew Garfield is one of the strongest actors of his generation. It's consideration of such dark, poignant themes and ideas (namely, the silence of God when people need him the most and the importance and dangers of an unwavering faith and reliance on one figure) is profound and very often moving, which contrasted with the brutality of the torture scenes, works on an effective but very uncomfortable level well. The opening scene, with the calmness of Liam Neeson narration in comparison to the brutality and discomfort of the torture being displayed, sets the film off on a strong footing, with some of the film's best work contained in this sequence. The final image is equally as powerful in its message (holding on to your faith) but a lot of the material in between weakens some of the impact. I completely understand the need for the film's runtime, eking out the journey and telling the story in as much detail as it deserves and I while admire the work and talent of Scorsese, it doesn't mean I have to love it and quite frankly, I didn't. Maybe, like some have suggested, I will look back at this more fondly than just a couple of hours after enduring it, but for the time being the film's biggest weakness is a little too deafening and difficult to overlook.FULL REVIEW: goo.gl/IkFgZB",Silence

Scorsese really fell out of favor with me some time ago but redeemed himself with this movie. There were some upset people with seeing these missionaries lose their faith, however, that was not the case. They were forced into this with no way out. Liam Neeson's character was beaten down and broken and he succumbed, but that doesn't mean the real person lost faith. The main Jesuit did not lose faith either because he would not have risked his very life, nor the safety, well-being, and life of his family to keep his cross all those years. I found myself getting upset towards the end, wondering if Scorsese was going to give this story an atheistic victory, but to my delight he did not.

206,SangamYadagiri,Faith vs Belief,8,5 February 2017,"Silence is one of the best pictures directed by Martin Scorsese. It's very well shot in the country side of Japan as well as the city of Nagasaki. The 17th century ambiance is created with great production design values. Main story of the movie is about the Christianity vs Buddhism. However the spirit of the movie depicts the human triumph of ultimate faith in God. Screenplay written by Martin and others is gripping and keeps the viewers at the edge of their seats. Though the length of the movie is 2 hour 40 minutes, not a single scene is boring. This time Martin chose a story that he can direct with the best of his capabilities and indeed he delivers the goods with an unflinching dedication. The lead actor Andrew Garfield has acted profoundly well and the brief but significant appearance by Liam Neeson gives the movie a matured look. The Japanese actors are to be appreciated due to their fantastic support as the 95 percent of the movie is shot in Japan.The movie is based on a book depicting a real story that took place around 1670 AD in Japan where two Portuguese Catholic missionaries set sail to Japan in search of their mentor who went to Japan for spreading the Catholicism there but got converted to Buddhism by Japanese. After reaching Japanese shores, they find out that the situation in Japan is dangerous for the Christians as the Catholicism was outlawed and the Japanese inquisitor is making all of the Christians in Japan to give up their faith in Jesus by making them stepping on Jesus' idol and surrender themselves or be tortured and die. It's not just about the conflicts between religious beliefs of people belonging to different geographical places, but the testing of the faith itself. How the faith leads the victory makes the crux of the story.I enjoyed this movie better than Martin Scorsese's previous movies like The Departed, The Aviator, Shutter Island, and old movies like Raging Bull, Casino, Good Fellas. After making a long list of movies with Leonardo DiCaprio, and waiting for 4 years after The Wolf of Wall Street, he comes up with a new star-cast (No Leo!) in this movie which gives a fresh feeling.As the tagline suggests, sometimes silence is the deadliest sound, one can only hear God in the Silence.

Knowing it was a passion project, and that it's the first film Scorsese is credited for writing since Casino, expectations were high. However, as Silence screens, whilst the cinematography and the music really help bring a world to life, the story drags and never results with a pay-off or any truly in-depth substance. Silence is filled with ""on the nose"" material, blunt to every point, and little subtlety. Garfield and Driver are average at best, but at no point, do their characters bring vibrancy or depth to the story. Funnily enough, or ironically maybe, the Japanese and their goals are more relatable than the ""heroes"" of the story.",Silence
208,saccitygrl,Silence: how catholic colonialism failed or how japan protected its culture,6,30 January 2017,"I am a huge Scorsese fan and while not every film he has made is a favorite of mine, my most favorited movies are directed by him. He is a brilliant director and not much more needs to be said about that.This film caught my eye for two reasons: Scorsese and Japan. And it delivers in the sense of showing the beauty of Japan, the culture in the 17th century and ample emotionally intense scenes and unforgettable images. Japan is lush and green as I remember it. The sound of cicadas takes me back to summer along the Tama River. The film is like being there again in many ways.Unfortunately, the subject matter was not my cup of tea and no matter how much I wanted to engage with the film I just couldn't get past the subject which seems utter madness to me to be told from this perspective of the suffering and crisis of faith of the missionaries. It seemed a rather overblown effort to create parallels with the Christ--as if these missionaries were white Jesus' coming to save Japan. From what exactly I'm not sure as everything suffered by the poor as portrayed in the film is identical to the suffering of peasants in europe at this time.I did enjoy the philosophical debates that ensued between the padre Rodrigues and the elites (esp. inquisitor and converted priest ferreira) who hold him prisoner. Probably the highlight of the film.But these discussions weren't enough to forget the irritating aspects of the film. For example, the narration grates very quickly. Its just a monologue of romanticism for religious fanaticism. I wish the film had heeded its title rather than add this aspect to the film. I think the content, if necessary to the plot, could have been conveyed in another way.So the movie is basically a two hour plus illustration of the utter waste of human life and suffering over the course of history all in the name of religion and fictional tales of yore. Its not a pleasant experience to watch and the questions raised by the film are not ones I personally wish to ponder as I have left that psychological crutch behind long ago.One thing that kept running through my mind during the film: if the Native Americans, who were also facing catholic colonialism during this period of history, had done what the Japanese did when they found western culture polluting their own, they might still have their languages, lands and ways of life. Maybe if you're religious this would be pleasant to watch, but for me it was a long long film that tangled with concepts that were not of much interest to me.One thing I found rather offensive was the dedication at the end of the film to the Japanese Christians. I remember meeting a few Japanese Christians while living in Japan. I found it rather intriguing that the Japanese in general viewed these believers with some level of--suspicion? I am not sure how else to characterize it but clearly their beliefs were not accepted and viewed as strange. Even with witnessing this, I still don't think a dedication like that is appropriate. It is basically characterizing the Japanese Christians as long suffering victims. The fact is, if Japan had not done what it did, it would have lost its culture and been overrun by colonialists like Hong Kong and other Asian cities. It may have been harsh but I think it was a wise choice to keep the European colonialist marauders at the beach head. And the tactics used as shown in this film were brilliant. If there is any doubt about that, just look at what happened to the indigenous peoples around the world who did not or could not make that same choice.",Silence
209,cosmicfish14,A Subtle Masterpiece,9,13 January 2017,"Now this was a film I've been giving some time to think about for the past week. I knew that this was my favorite film of the year, but I had a hard time trying to explain why. But now I think I understand. Silence is a film that tackles its ideas and themes mainly through sounds and images, not words. There are definitely a few dialogue heavy scenes, but the scenes that leave the most impact are the ones that linger on the sounds and visuals rather than whats being said. And not only does that approach make this Scorsese's second best film (in my opinion) but also the most powerful and emotionally resonating film of the whole year. Because its not the moments where characters give passionate discussions that I remember the most. Its the haunting images that have embedded into my memory as well the sounds, or the lack there of. Im definitely going to rewatch this when this gets a wider release. I have a feeling this won't be as successful as Scorsese's other films, mostly because its quite lengthy and slowly paced. But I feel that for its slow pacing there isn't a moment where I wasn't engrossed in what was being presented. I absolutely urge everyone to go see this movie, even if you think it might not be your thing. I want go any longer because I feel like I'll just start rambling. Then again, maybe great movies can do that to you. Also shitty movies of course, but luckily this is not a shitty movie.100/100",Silence
210,mclong2009,"Certainly a long movie, but worth it",9,24 January 2017,"""Silence"" with its largely unanswered questions of faith and and God and religion, it certainly a long movie, but worth seeing. The acting is incredible throughout--the English and Japanese actors both doing a superb job. The story of Portuguese priests in Japan in the 1600s was interesting for me, because I could see both sides. What value did this new religion bring to the ruling class of Japan? They were a culture who followed the beauty and power of nature, and some scenes in the movie, a stunning view of the moon for instance, highlighted this. The movie gets a little slow sometimes but some of the final scenes with Mr. Neeson and Mr. Garfield are some of the most moving and powerful I've ever witnessed. Anyone interested in this movie would do well to read James Clavell's ""Shogun"", another engrossing novel set in Japan and encompassing the same time period.",Silence
211,joshteggert,"Unlike anything you've ever seen before, for reasons both good and bad",6,12 January 2017,"Having wrestled with getting Shūsaku Endō's 1966 historical novel adapted since 1988, Martin Scorsese's 28 year battle with screenplay, financial and legal troubles is finally over with the release of 'Silence'; an epic story of two missionary priests (Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) and their journey into 17th Century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed on pain of torture and death. Their mission: to find Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who went years before to spread the word of God but supposedly denounced the faith whilst there.Films that extend to over 2 hours 30 minutes are not unfamiliar to moviegoers of the 21st Century; even the mighty superhero genre has ventured beyond this mark with 'The Dark Knight Rises', which was undeniably stretched. Notably though, Scorsese is one of the master filmmakers in this area and standing at 2 hours 41 minutes, 'Silence' is similar in length with his other projects. However, it consistently peaks and drops between scenes of fascination and disinterest; for this reason, it does not reach the heights of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' or 'Gangs of New York' (both over 3 hours long) which expertly maintain the viewers captivation throughout.Where the moments are good they are artistically beautiful, as cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto provides atmospheric shots of Taiwan's (standing in for Japan as the setting) landscape so sweetly, it makes such dreadful torture scenes where people are burned with boiling water or drowned at sea somehow feel serene. But when the artistic nature of this film cannot be appreciated during the admittedly repetitive extended scenes of dialogue, it nadirs to pure boredom, and one cannot help but think 'Silence' tries too hard to make the viewer aptly acknowledge the magnitude of the film.Fulfilling the mainstream appeal of this film, Andrew Garfield rises from the ashes of 'The Amazing Spider-Man' series with undeniable gravity, and Adam Driver proves his acting skills further, swaying far from the 'Star Wars' franchise, which has type-casted many before him. But both fall just short of legendary performances with unstable Portuguese accents in with their English dialogue, adding to the films inconsistency. Liam Neeson's talent is barely used; even he looks confused at his lack of participation at times, but is still as solid as ever. But it's the Japanese cast that truly shine here, with Tadanobu Asano and Issei Ogata playing their respective roles with conviction, portraying their manipulative characters with confidence and unquestionable ability.Scorsese addresses the complex issues in this film with the experience that one would expect from the 74 year-old classic director, and while 'Silence' may not be as engrossing as 'Goodfellas' for example, it is eloquent yet sharp to the point, and can be a joy to watch.'Silence' is a culmination of artistic class and mundanity, certainly not a highlight amongst Martin Scorsese's vast collection of thrilling and intricate plots that have been seen in his previous films, but it stands out as possibly one of his most aesthetically creative works yet.",Silence

I think this movie should have Oscar buzz on it but I know the action loving public may not gravitate to the artistic perfection of this masterpiece.

While in general I think him to be quite overrated, I could only classify his previous movies that I've watched as at least ""good"". Well, there's an exception to every rule.I honestly am at a loss for words, there is almost nothing to like in this movie. The whole plot can be described as ""Japanese officials demand Garfield to denounce his religion, he refuses, common folk gets tortured"", repeated a good dozen times. The protagonists are unlikable and hard to relate oneself to. (This could be intentional.) The dialogues, which comprise the bigger part of Silence, are boring and at times pretentious. (Yeah, the tree metaphors aren't nearly as smart as they try to sound.) The religious debates are shallow and bland. What's worse, some moments are outright cheesy, like Garfield's reflection morphing into the face of Jesus or God actually talking to him. The movie just fails miserably to get the audience interested and emotionally invested.The only reasons this is not a 1/10 are the quite good cinematography and Andrew Garfield. He, now unshackled from the mediocre Spider-Man reboots, has shown for the second time in a row this year that he is a very potent actor. Still, he alone could not save this movie.You know, the audience's experience kind of reflects the protagonist's journey.

218,ghent1,Splendid but not for everybody,8,31 December 2018,"I've seen this movie three times by now and still think it's brilliant, yet it's not a movie for everybody. It's surely no coincidence that even Martin Scorsese had to struggle for 25 years to scrape together the funds to make it.I can also understand why so many folks feel the movie is boring and too long even if to me it was neither boring nor too long. In fact, it feels just perfect.
The reason I suppose many people don't truly 'feel' this movie -an exception in Mr Scorsese's rich filmography- is because of its theme. For surely, in times of abundant secularism and reductionist materialism, a movie such as this one cannot be other than a dinosaur.Essentially this is a movie about the genuine spiritual process of transcending implicit narcissism into an effulgence of humble, selfless Love. It is therefore a movie about the genuine path of authentic christianity.What makes it a special movie, at least in my heart, is that it not only sharply portrays this process of self-transcendence but also makes the link to the collective missionary adolescence of historical christianity. For surely, the Japanese are very much refined in their cruelty, yet they clearly are much more sane and of a deeper (personal and cultural) wisdom than are the young Portuguese missionaries who remain by and large unaware of the unwarranted cultural superiority with which they approach the Japanese.
To bring all of this clearly into focus and allow for the story to reach its spiritual and historical apogee took close to three hours of masterful moviemaking.Not to make this an overly long review: for those who are knowledgeable about the genuine (christian) path of self-transcendence into humbled Love, this is surely a masterful film. For others it is a boring waste of time.Those who love this movie may also be interested in checking out ""The Assassin"" by Hsiao-hsien Hou. This movie is about the taoistic version of the same inner path of transcending attachment to emotions and your social identity of the past to arrive at ultimate immersion in the Tao or the natural way.",Silence
219,kastenmeier-andreas,Faith in 3 Hours,8,12 March 2017,"Martin Scorsese is one of very few directors who continues to make good movies in more than 50 years of working. This movie is no exception. But to warn you straight out, Silence is not mainstream or even an epic movie in the classical way. In its heart its a small movie about people with faith, their reasons for believing and their struggle to keep doing it. So there are no big scenes with great mind blowing dialog or action.I personally also had a hard time connecting myself to the people depicted on the screen, because i can not emotionally understand the concept of faith and believing in a greater power. The actors are all good in this movie and the characters are fleshed out very well, but their motivations are unfamiliar to me. So some decisions are hard to understand. But that is one point of the movie. The cinematography and direction of the movie are stunningly great. I personally didn't like the last half an hour as much as the rest of the movie and i would have liked more of Adam Driver.

221,horitaj,Scorsese Does it Again!!!,10,15 January 2017,"""Silence"" is Martin Scorsese's latest masterpiece of cinema that he's brought us since his 2013 hit ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". ""Silence"" follows two Jesuit priests played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver who invoke on a mission to go to Japan to find and rescue their mentor, Father Ferreira (played by Liam Neeson) and to spread the faith to the Japanese at the same time. ""Silence"" was a film that Scorsese spent the past few decades trying to make and even though it took him such a long time to bring this powerful story to the big screen I'm just glad that it got made. ""Silence"" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Japanese author, Shusaku Endo. I read the book and loved it and the movie is just as up to par as the book. This is one of the best adaptations of a book I've ever seen, the movie has all the plot points, themes, and messages the book had and brought it to the screen flawlessly.The acting in this film is phenomenal. Every person in this film is on the top of their game no matter how big or small their role was in this film. Andrew Garfield's performance in ""Silence"" better get him that golden statue because he gave such a powerful and emotionally draining performance to the point that I forgot that I'm even watching a movie. Seeing Liam Neeson actually give a dramatic and emotional performance was great, it was nice to see him take his time to be in this film and not go off and do another mediocre action movie.The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous in this film and there's not one shot that feels out of place or out of focus. Scorsese directs the hell out of this movie and never loses focus one bit, he better get nominated for best director for the Oscars. One thing I will say about ""Silence"" is that it is very long and very hard to watch at times. Considering that the film is about the test of one man's faith automatically seems like an emotionally draining film, it's nowhere what you thought you'd imagine while watching this film. You see our protagonist (Garfield) go through hell and back while watching and experiencing such horrific things. There were times where I teared up and there were times where I grimaced, and there were times where I just wanted to see the suffering end. If there were to be another title of this film it would be called ""Suffering"", no joke.What else can I say, Scorsese pulls another masterpiece out of the box and deserves all the credit he deserves for just making this film alone. If you love Scorsese's work I highly suggest you to go see ""Silence"" because this is one of his finests without a doubt.",Silence

It's more than 2,5 hours of sheer boredom during which 3 out of 10 people walked out of the cinema and left us often wondering whether we were watching a really boring movie - or a comedy / self-parody.A movie that uses 1 dimensional characters with no development and to whom you feel no connection - and watch them do completely senseless things in a world that neither you nor they understand: it doesn't seem to make sense. And it really doesn't.The only positive thing of this movie is how memorable it was watching it: we found ourselves laughing at the (supposedly) most touching scenes, we saw people walking out in the middle of the movie and kept wondering: is it really the movie we had paid for or has there been some mistake in the projection room?",Silence
223,listofnames,Religion laid bare,7,16 January 2017,"A pair of Portuguese Catholic priests go to Japan to determine the fate of their former mentor. Instead they mostly administer to a small villages of faithful Japanese Christians. This they must do in secret as the Japanese authorities have cracked down hard (torturing and killing) on those found to be practising in an effort to stamp out the 'foreign cancer'. Thus sets the scene for Andrew Garfield's Padre's faith to be severely tested. Does he apostatise (even just symbolically) in order to save the lives of others. For me as someone who has been an atheist since the age of 15 this film shows up the problems of most Religions: the false ideas of God as person and a perfect afterlife, thus making us believe that this worldly existence is just a test run, something to be tolerated. The Japanese thought this dangerous to society. Their ruthless crackdown on those caught practising was, in their minds, a way of protecting Japanese society.Others will see any refusal to step on the image of Christ as a sign of great faith. But what is great faith in this life when all it brings is misery. They are sold the lie of a great paradise in the next life, all you have to do is believe. This worldly reality becomes unimportant as a result. The Japanese have always been keenly aware of this worldly reality as being the ultimate reality and therefore could not tolerate an idea that would undermine it.The silence referred to in the title was the response given when the Padre needed guidance from his God. Is he just talking to himself? How does he know God is listening, how can be be real if he never talks back? He just needs to have faith that he is. He hopes and hopes and hopes. But always silence. Is it a good thing to cling so desperately to an idea, any idea? Especially one based solely on faith.The film is good at illustrating the problems with this position and what it can lead to - the peasants blindly accepting death and torture for a better life in paradise. It also shows the intolerance on the other side and what it can lead to - killing people for false beliefs. The silence is what we cant tolerate. We make up a sky god to fill the silence. We'll do anything to fill the silence. Because we cant stand to face the reality of our nothingness and meaninglessness.The film is good because it asks these questions but it doesn't go so far as to openly condemn these false beliefs. It lets them speak for themselves, which to me was their folly but it also has sympathy for those that cling to them.",Silence

I should have been gone well before the film completed. Perhaps, competition has been causing TV to improve and the lack of competition, formula movies, special effects, inflated-paid IMDb reviews, robots, and Chinese funding have been working in tandem to destroy the movie going experience.

226,funnyfaceking,Will be remembered as one of Scorsese's truly great films.,10,6 September 2017,"Fifty years from now, this will be remembered as one of Scorsese's truly great films. It's not fashionable to make a film about devout Jesuit missionaries these days. Certainly not as fashionable as making films about sucking cocaine out of prostitutes' orifices.This film has a soul. It has a purpose. It sets up a goalpost. It does not move them. It achieves the goal.The first two acts are very violent and disturbing, not unlike The Passion of the Christ or The Mission, which also starred a younger Liam Neeson, Robert DeNiro and Jeremy Irons as Jesuit Priests in the Amazon jungles. Real portrayals of actual martyrdom occur relentlessly, multiple times, and for quite some time in Silence. And it is extremely confusing and distressing to watch. There are a few gory scenes, but the real torture comes from the mental games that the Inquisitors play in order to get the outlaw Christians to renounce their faith.The third act has quite an impressive twist that I did not expect at all. By the end, it was truly graceful and satisfying. Scorse has said that Taxi Driver was directly influenced by Robert Bresson's Pickpocket, both tales of alienation in modern society. I haven't seen a lot of discussion about Silence, but it seems to be that the third act especially must have been influenced, at least in part, by Bresson's masterpiece Diary of a Country Priest. One of my favorite films of all time. Though I fell asleep three times trying to watch Diary, my heart soared when I finally got to see the end of it. ""All is...""

227,alex-klein2424,Silence is a Good Thing,8,20 February 2017,"The movie opens in pitch black with just the background noise you would hear in a Japanese forest when all of a sudden all sound cuts completely as the title of the movie flashes on the screen. From that moment I knew I'd be in for a great movie and I was right.Silence is a movie not just about faith but more about what that concept means to different people. What are you willing to give up for your faith when others lives are on the line? Is it worth it? These are big questions and Scorsese attempts to answer them in as best a way as he can. Even if at times he doesn't answer all the questions, he leaves it up to the audience to discuss at length afterwards.The story begins as two priests from Portugal head to Japan to attempt to find one of their own who they fear is either captured at best, or he given up his faith at worst. As they make the trip they find themselves thrusted directly into the lives of a town of hiding Christian's during a period of inquisition and fear in Japan. There are a lot of similarities that could be drawn to the inquisition here and those that were held by the Christian's themselves in other parts of the world but that's a different discussion suffice to say that it seems the movie is acknowledging it. It even seems at times the movie asks you to question who actually is wrong and who is right.The performance by Andrew Garfield is the driving force of this film along with some great help from Adam Driver and a slew of wonderful Asian actors. Liam Neeson also gives a memorable performance during the climax of the film. Beyond that all of these performances and moments are assisted by a mostly absent soundtrack, with most moments filled with appropriate silence to make you reflect and draw your own emotion.As you'll find when you look up this movie, it is long. At almost 3 hours it does drag at times if but briefly but I was surprised to find myself at the end thinking it had flown by. The dragging mainly comes at the end of the movie as there are multiple times I thought it would end and then it didn't. The cinematography is beautiful with amazing shots of forests, ocean shores, caves and Japanese culture which more than makes up for the length because it feels like you are glimpsing at something truly majestic.",Silence
228,demented_peruvian,Old-school religious epic turned torture porn,6,30 July 2017,"It's hard to rate ""Silence"" because it's one of those movies that has a lot of good going for it, but ultimately loses it's way, and my appreciation of it drops the more I think about it. My original rating was ""8"". ""Silence"" ultimately does not work as Scorsese's flaws get the best of him.This is a movie about Catholicism, perhaps made for Catholics. It shows that this production had it's inception in late 1980s, as it is similar to the ""priests travel to a foreign land and suffer"" epics of the era, from ""The Mission"" to ""Black Robe"", the latter which it most resembles in pace and visual style. Many of the religious practices and references (what is a Jesuit? Why are they talking in Latin?) will be lost on non-Catholic audiences. However, most with some understanding of European history will appreciate that this is the opposite of a Spanish Inquisition movie: the Catholic priests are the ones persecuted and tortured by an Inquisitor who tries to get them to denounce their faith. I grew up very Catholic, and I've come to appreciate different main types of practicing devout Catholics: 1) those who only focus on Jesus suffering for others' sin, the need to repent, the need to suffer, and yelling that everyone else is a sinner; 2) the ritualistic, who are focused on repetitive prayers, rituals, statues, and rosaries (e.g. Marianists); 3) the institutional crowd, who worship the Church itself, with focus on Roman Empire culture and social conservatism as a way of maintaining feudalistic/oligarchic societies (e.g. Opus Dei and Benedict XVI's crowd); 4) those who focus on trying to carry out good deeds, love, build communities, and transcend the material (e.g. Franciscans, Carmelites, and Jesuits). In ""Silence"", Scorsese tries to explore all of these aspects of Catholicism to some degree or another, but seems to settle on mostly the first two.Thus after an intriguing first hour, with great cinematography, and an interesting story of missionaries overcoming their needs and doubts to try to give hope to those who live wretched lives (and how much religion properly translates), and those who risk their life for their faith, we are treated to a visually and aurally unpleasant second hour. This hour is a repetitive depiction of people being tortured and killed, while they either follow their own rituals, or follow a Japanese ritual to renounce their faith. In fact, it mostly consists of a Shogun with an improbably ugly, nasal voice and his associates yelling ""Trample!"" at poor, suffering Japanese peasants, who cry and say ""I don't want to trample!"" to Andrew Garfield's priest, after which we see feet step on a bronze plaque with a religious image, and then see the peasants are whacked half the time anyway, while a priest cringes. At times there's interesting dialogue on theology, cross-cultural misunderstandings, Western vs. Eastern philosophy, the main character's arrogance, symbols vs actions in Christian faith, and facing the consequences of Catholic beliefs (pardoning of sins, going to Heaven, martyrdom) when things go sour. At it's thematically best, ""Silence"" explores it's title by addressing the flip side of the saying ""There's no atheists in foxholes"": what if you are stuck a long time suffering in the foxhole, seeing people die around you, and God doesn't answer your prayers? And here's where Scorsese's flaws as a filmmaker ruin this movie. Scorsese has always been less of an actual story teller, and prefers to show us intertwined experiences of a character, often one who is loyal to an institution or social group, with their fall from grace due to sin (pride, wrath, paranoid distrust, or lust and general hedonism). Scorsese tends to make those falls be extra-long, with repetitive scenes. We often tend to allow it to pass, as those scenes can be entertaining and dynamic, leading to the film eventually wrapping up with some sort of quick glimpse into the character's life to come. But in ""Silence"" the repetitive scenes are unpleasant and torturous, and ultimately become boring. Then what should be a 3-5 minute final scene instead becomes 20-30 minutes long, with a new narrator, and some pointless long shots that make you wonder if Thelma Schoonmaker gave up and walked out of the editing room. What starts as an open-minded glance into Japanese culture turns into an almost villainous depiction of it. And while thematically it goes from carefully exploring Jesuit concepts, from the vows of obedience and poverty, to a heavy exploration of the concept of Casuistry, ultimately there's a missed opportunity to explore the Jesuit concept of contemplation (detachment and ""finding God in all things""), as the movie goes too far in exploring the feeling of spiritual abandonment, with an unconvincing return to spirituality.Although the repetitive scenes are what drags down what sounds like a much better movie, they were not the only flaw. Another distracting factor is the main characters themselves. They are Portuguese priests, but the only one who looks vaguely Lusitanian is Adam Driver. Driver and Garfield start out with varying accents, before eventually giving up altogether. Liam Neeson doesn't even try, and speaks in his Liam Neeson voice, although I'm able to forgive him, as he's come to occupy that spot previously reserved for Sean Connery (""he's playing a Spaniard named Ramirez, but he speaks like Sean Connery. Who cares, he sounds cool!""). I get that this was not the original cast, who could have passed more like Portuguese. However, we have to deal with whom wound up on screen. These Portuguese are stranger as they are speaking in English, as are some of the Japanese. What's the point of making everything else look and sound authentic, if you are going to do that big change? In the end the biggest question Scorsese left me with was: did he simply make this flop to be done and get over with it, and avoid further legal battles?",Silence
229,barryweir,"I don't think Scorsese and I are on the same page, however....",8,14 March 2017,"...as an atheist I still found great value in this picture.At the very end of the movie, between the end scene and the credit, is a tribute to the persecuted Japanese Catholics and their pastors. It was that tribute that made me feel a bit like this was Scorsese's own religious convictions breaking the fourth wall. That this was, in a way, his Schindler's List.As an atheist I find the general idea of religion to be preposterous, illogical and rightly questioned. However, I feel that for me this movie helped to illustrate something very important. Firstly that you cannot kill an idea if someone truly believes in it, and secondly that our actions and our morality are not defined by the superficial....the greatest irony coming out of this being that the movie does, if anything, question religion as much as it seemingly advocates it with it's dedication.I have read that the movie is said to demonise Buddhism. I did not find this to be so. I found it to be very respectful of it. Indeed, the movie helps to illustrate how people claim to follow peaceful faiths, but are in reality scared of ideas and the loss of control. Perhaps another irony that Scorsese maybe did not mean to present, given his own Catholicism, and give the history of the Catholic church, is that he makes a very good case against the proselytizing carried out by pretty much every major religion of today, including his own. He also makes a good case for demonstrating that religion is, and always has been, simply an idea, and that it is one's belief and loyalty in that idea that makes them who they are. That faith in anything, but a religious idea, or a belief in fundamental human rights and civil liberties, should be one that is ultimately determined by the individual in heart and mind.My only complaint is that I found the movie somewhat simplistic. It was obvious from a third of the way in how the movie was going to end, and I say that while not being familiar with the original source material. But this is perhaps not as a great a criticism as maybe it could be because the movie gives plenty to think about throughout. Many have called the movie overlong and boring. On this I couldn't disagree more. It is very refreshing to watch a movie driven by thought and contemplation, rather than style, clichés and breakneck speed.Recommended.",Silence

232,showmethemoviescontact,Silence ShowMeTheMovies Review,4,24 January 2017,"https://showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-silence.html Martin Scorsese's passion project of 28 years falls upon deaf ears with this reviewer.Upon first glance, Silence appeared to be a long-winded Samurai action flick, with the likes of actors Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver placing high expectations on Scorsese's new offering. In contrast, the film is about the tribulations of religion, and the Japanese' views on the outlawed Catholicism in the 17th century.The plot primarily centres around a character known as Ferreria (Neeson) - a Christian mentor captured by the Japanese - and a pair of his Portugese students Rodrigues (Garfield) and Garupe (Driver), whom, upon hearing rumours of Ferreria having apostatized (renouncing his religious beliefs for the purpose of saving his own life), travel to Japan in order to search for him, whilst remaining unseen by those who would object their faith.This plot, seemingly 90-minute-worthy, is dragged out by Scorsese to the point that the film becomes repetitive. Throughout, Christian persecution is a naturally recurring theme, but there are only so many times one can be shown the death/torture of people - or their forceable denouncement of Christ - before you become desensitised to its' occurrence.Silence, seemingly alluding to not only the silence of God during times of need for the leads, but also to the extrinsic lack of music and/or sound entirely throughout. On multiple occasions, Rodrigues (Garfield) is forced to test his faith, and finds it difficult to accept criticism of such; what he viewed as a slightly dangerous mission to recover his mentor transforms into a far more sinister quest - and Andrew Garfield shakily conveys this by breaking down in tears in almost every scene, upon which he is told that his God is not listening.The absence of music is another poor choice - awkward silences apparent and a disturbing lack of atmosphere. Moments within the film are essentially devoid of sound between dialogue, and special effects in this department are minimal. As a result, the intentional efforts to portray themes of isolation and loneliness fall short, and merely boils down to two and a half hours of little-to-no substance.Alongside this, the singular concept is over-played throughout the duration of the picture - any attempt to change its' plot direction just falls flat and then continues on the same course. Even when Ferreria's presence comes into play, it barely adds anything and Neeson is underused - just more torture, more apostatizing, and more of Andrew Garfield crying, to the point I would just roll my eyes by the end.The acting quality was shoddy to say the least; Garfield and Driver's attempts at (I believe) a Portugese accent sounded like they were trying too hard, and their chemistry lacked (possibly due to the lack of atmospheric noise) with awkward pauses. As Catholics who are meant to have been together for a long time, they did not seem like good friends in any way - arguing about their mission and then just being sad together does not appear to depict a brotherly bond. The chemistry between Ferreria and Rodrigues is slightly better, since Neeson did work well as a jaded fallen mentor - but still lacklustre.The story does not really get anywhere by closing credits - the film just feels very dense, as if I was meant to get the point in it; which seems like it is not apparent at all. The movie gives off a very pretentious vibe like this was supposed to be the next Passion of the Christ, but with the lack of soundtrack and awkward direction (namely, that particularly ridiculous scene in which Jesus himself talks to one of the characters) was closer to watching a film from the era of Ben Hur or Jason and the Argonauts when movies were far more limited.What can be commended is that the writing quality was not terrible - although the length of the film was completely unjustified, and the actors (particularly Garfield) did not pull off the intended notes - the themes are indeed very interesting, and the script itself satisfactory - probably because this film is an adaption from a book written in the 1960s.Silence has many issues overall, and I fail to understand how Scorsese invested 28 years on developing this project, or how the plot could have interested him so much that a 2 hour 40 minute run-time was justified (a 30 minute short would have sufficed). While not awful, it certainly needed much more refinement, and a change in cast that never came. I have little faith in this doing well at box office.",Silence

While looking for their mentor, their faith will be tested to the limit.It took me quiet some time to rewatch this movie because I found it extremely hard to watch due to the length of the movie and the violence which makes you feel extremely miserable. However, I finally managed to watch it again, and the movie still remains extremely powerful.It has mainly to do with the great performances of Garfield, Neeson and Driver, it is a shame they did not get recognized at the academy awards. Especially upon second viewing, the conversations about faith, religion and selling religion in a foreign country are fascinating and never boring. Also the scenes with the Judas figure made much more sense upon second viewing.While the movie is beautifully shot, the movie is a torture to sit through both because of the violence and the length I don't know if this was done on purpose so that we immerse ourselves with Garfield. This, together with a huge amount of dialogue in Japanese, which is not subtitled, can be off putting for some viewers.

But after reading several negative user reviews, I'm convinced people did not get Silence.Silence is not telling you the priests are doing the right thing. It is not telling you that Japan is evil. It is not telling people to convert to Christianity. It is merely portraying historical fictitious events as they happen and it does so masterfully.Silence portrays a priest struggling with whether he should apostatize (renounce his faith) and save other's lives, or to let them die, appearing selfish, for what he believes is right. Now you may think that one side is right but Scorsese presents both sides showing that it is a gray area. It is less about religion and more about the cost of your beliefs making it more powerful than most movies.People complain about the run time. Those people were watching it, not experiencing it. The run time is long, but it is for a reason. Many similar scenes seem to repeat, however in between each the movie introduces a new idea so when you see it again it inflicts a different mood and different opinion. Taking a viewer and putting them in the story and experience the events is true storytelling. If you check your phone, you are only gipping yourself of a great experience.In addition to what's been already said, it's important to point out that the slew of reviewers claiming ""this is NOT good film making or good basic storytelling"" are completely ignorant to film. You can say you don't like it but ignoring the fact that this has an amazing score, some of the most beautiful camera work and cinematography, Garfield's amazing method acting and at least presenting beliefs in an objective matter.Silence is a flawless movie.

The first thing that came to mind for me was ""If we believe in absurdities we shall commit atrocities"". I seriously doubt promoting atheism was Mr. Scorsese's intent, but that's what I got from this sleeping pill of a movie.

The costumes and sets look very authentic, I'm glad this movie was postponed for years and years to be shot, I don't think it would be visually as pretty if it was shot years ago.The story is a very curious one, about a very distant and extremely controversial subject, the presence of Portuguese Jesuits in 1660's Japan. The story itself is very interesting, but I don't fell like the cast was strong enough for this kind of movie, and that is why this movie falls short for me. 2 hours and a half of Andrrew Garfield is just way too much, and even though he has some good moments, I feel like overall his acting is simply not good enough.

I'm not sure if we were supposed to empathize with the missionaries and admire their faith, or to accept the futility of forcing a belief on a foreign culture. All the pain and suffering in this film basically reinforced my belief that religion does nothing but divide humanity (even the Buddhists were blood-thirsty in this!) and create the illusion that life on Earth is a mere pit-stop on the way someplace better. On the plus side, I enjoyed all of the main Japanese actors, especially the translator and the main, somewhat goofy Samurai(?). It was probably only me, but I felt the first Japanese guy (drunk) was hilarious in the way he kept flip-flopping and asking for confession. It was like a running gag.

A big problem is the script, attributed to Scorsese, which apparently went through many re-writes, usually not a sign the words will leap off the paper, or in this case, the film. The dialogue seems academic, a not very imaginative re-creation of the way priests might talk in the 17th century. Instead of an experience we get a dissertation. And then there's the language problem. The priests are Portuguese but they speak in English. As do the Japanese although it is unlikely they would know English, or more to the point, Portuguese. Subtitles with people actually speaking their native languages would have made the film seem more realistic.The other problem is casting Andrew Garfield as the lead. Utterly unconvincing.

Yes, the Japanese tortured Christians during this time, but Scorsese leaves out huge chunks of history that can explain at least some of the behavior.During this period, the Portuguese were using missionaries as a vehicle to make inroads into the Japanese market, and they even trafficked in Japanese peasants in the global slave trade. So Japan wasn't refuting Christianity solely on religious grounds. It was a political rebellion, as well, which is understandable when chunks of your population disappear onto slave ships.But of course for Scorsese to tell his tale, he must make it all about religion, but even on that level, I've no idea what point he's trying to make. Towards the end, when we actually hear the voice of God as a narrator, I knew he had really lost his way. If you can't tell your story just through the narrative, without strange voices stepping in from who knows where, do you even have a story to tell?And then he dedicates the film to ""the Japanese Christians and their pastors.""

246,William-of-Baskerville,"Excellent movie on Christian perseverance and suffering, faith and doubt. Haunting.",10,9 December 2018,"I rarely score movies a 10 out of 10, but Martin's Scorsese's Silence fully deserves it. This movie is so haunting, so impressive, has such an emotional and spiritual impact, even after viewing it multiple times, it does not fail to impress, and leave a mark on your soul.The subject of the movie is highly unusual, as well as highly unpopular, both with Christian viewers, as with non-Christian viewers. Some of the reviews here clearly show anti-Christian sentiments who just seem to down-vote because of the clear Christian content of this movie. It's not often that in a movie Jesus actually speaks. Apparently that triggers a nerve, almost similar to how the Japanese responded when Jesuit priests came to Japan to share the gospel of salvation through the redemptive work of Christ in his vicarious death, suffering for the sins of mankind. This has been described in Shusaku Endo's novel, the base for this movie. But we also know from other historic accounts how blatantly anti-Christian the Japanese elite were, seeing it as a direct threat to their rule. The brutal persecution that followed resulted in Christianity being almost completely erased from Japan until modern times, and still modern Japan has only a marginal number of Christians.But the movie goes deeper, touching subjects that also make many Christians feel uncomfortable. Do not expect a heroic, glorious, Hollywood, happy-clappy, superficial version of Christianity, with a feel good happy ending. It goes deep, and it goes raw. Which is not what many Christian viewers seemed to expect either. Not surprisingly, Endo's novel initially was harshly criticized by Roman Catholics, a sentiment that is reflected in some reviewers comments too.This movie not only takes the viewers in a fascinating but gruesome bit of history, it also dares to explore some very deeply disturbing spiritual questions, without providing the answers. The movie is beautifully shot, and the sound design perfectly reflects the gruesome atmosphere. Viewers have complained this movie is too long and boring, but I strongly disagree. The slow buildup, the somewhat repetitious events, all bring the viewer into an inner state where you really connect to the issues presented deep in your soul. And the acting work of Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver is actually amazing, especially for actors of their age. In contrast I found the acting of Liam Neeson a bit underwhelming.At the surface the movie addresses the already difficult issue of suffering and persecution. How is someone prepared to suffer under persecution for the faith that is his deepest conviction? But also, how does a Christian deal with the guilt of denouncing his faith, and can he repent of that and be restored in the faith. And at what point have you suffered enough? Should you give in -- not to save your own life, but the life of others? And if you give in, does it mean you failed as a Christian?But the movie goes deeper, as you can probably guess from the title. How can God allow his faithful servants to suffer? Why does He appear to be silent? Why does He not interfere? Why does He not help these missionaries to spread the Christian faith? It is this same question not only the viewer, but the characters struggle with. Does the silence imply God does not exist? The characters are brutally tortured while facing these questions. And we follow them as they struggle with these questions. Yet, in face of all this, chilling, literally awesome appearances of the suffering Christ are shown, where He speaks to us. Is it imagination, is it real to the characters?The movie is excellent to NOT give an answer to these questions, although it is somewhat suggestive. It offers these questions to the viewer, to think of these profound questions himself.It's rare to encounter a movie which takes such an approach, and dares to address such deeply spiritual themes in such a way to confront the viewer and deeply disturb him.Haunting.

End of story.Japanese inquisitor portrays a very wise man, true patriot and cruel strategist. I simply love this man which is why I am not rating this movie 1. He thinks that religion is a method of acquiring territory for Europeans (which it was). He also wants to preserve the native culture while being open to reform it, which every person should. Yes, his methods of torture are the definition of cruel and evil, but so is CIA's torture of its own citizens in the modern era(and people aren't complaining enough about that).This movie tries to show ""power"" of ""faith"".

They have traveled to Japan in search of another priest (Liam Neeson) who by all accounts has renounced his Christian faith. The film takes place during a time of persecution, when Christians are forced by an inquisitor (Issey Ogata) to denounce Jesus Christ by stepping on an engraved plaque bearing his likeness, or face torture and death.My favorite scene is the one in which Father Cristóvão Ferreira (Neeson) reveals how nature, specifically the sun, played a role in the villagers' understanding of the priests' message of Jesus Christ. It is wonderfully backlit and suggests the use of natural light, and when Father Ferreira points up at the sky, the camera zooms in for an extreme close-up of the yellow blazing ball of fire. The sun appears powerfully radiant. It's the same sun that has the power to expose the priests in hiding if they dare to step out of their huts. Water is no less forgiving, quenching Sebastião Rodrigues' (Garfield) thirst from a stream one moment, and punishing Christian villagers being tortured the next moment.

Unfortunately, from the moment I saw the millennials posing with their token superior, arguing their need to rush off to Japan to save their inspiration in some of the most preposterous accents I've heard in cinema, as though they were somehow entitled to make this dangerous journey, I knew the whole movie was on dangerous ground. When they arrive in Japan & meet the clandestine Christians from the local village, they are surprised that the locals, living under iron-fisted feudal Japanese conditions, do not travel around to the nearby villages to share their ideas about Christianity with their fellow countrymen & women -- right, thought I, they'll just grab their Lonely Planet & backpack and take a little tour of the countryside, eh? The best of the ridiculous is when our ""Jesuit Padres"" are in hiding in the hills & the Driver shouts out, that he can't take being cooped up in their little cabin, hidden away under these conditions any more -- I'm finishing his cry: ""I can't take being cooped up in here without my smart phone!""I was ready to turn the thing off about 20 minutes in, but figured I'd give it a chance to get better -- which seldom happens.

I wasted the next 40 minutes of my life watching & then had an epiphany & left the room around the one hour mark. Who knows? Maybe Mr. Neeson did save the movie. I don't care to find out.The script is one of the worst I've observed in a very long time for a movie rated 6.5 or above on IMDb. One of the key premises, the invention of some adversarial relationship between ""Christian"" and ""Buddhist"" is preposterous. There was no ""Christian Brotherhood"" just as there was no ""Buddhist Brotherhood"" in the 17th century. The power brokers of the day used the sects to their advantage, in Europe just as in East Asia. Remember, Queen Elizabeth I lopped off the head of her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. Both Christians, to be sure. There was no ""Germany"" or ""Italy"" in the 17th century. Even the two dominant Catholic powers hated each other and required Papal intervention to keep each other somewhat in check. The same thing was going on in Japan, with different power brokers manipulating the different sects of Zen, as well as other non-Buddhist beliefs, if they felt they could do so to advantage, with bribery, corruption, violence, and torture occurring when convenient. ""Christian vs. Buddhist"" was not the issue of the day. The world wide issue was, anybody who's a threat to a power broker is an adversary, ""Anybody vs. Anybody Else"". Parallels to ""The Mission""? Give me a break! I don't even recall hearing any musical score in this ""Paterson Poseur Goes to Taiwan-posing-as-Japan"" -- must be what they mean by ""Silence"". The only parallels are Liam Neeson and the cinematography. ""The Mission"" contains things like a compelling story, a great script, a fabulous film score -- and extraordinary acting!On a slight positive note for ""Silence"", I did like the cinematography -- I have no objection to the Oscar nomination in that category.. Too bad there were a bunch of play-actors in the movie disrupting the fine cinematography!I will close this review expressing my bitter disappointment with Adam Driver in 2016. I really enjoyed watching his rise in different supporting roles over the past several years & was hoping to see him shine in a lead role. He was pretentious playing poetry-scribbler, Williams wannabe working stiff Paterson from Paterson, and just silly in Silence.

251,barbourjohn-633-608932,The Most Disturbing Movie of the Year A Christian Critique:,3,8 May 2017,"Why Christians would recommend or celebrate this film is beyond belief. They really should be ashamed, especially the Pope and his Jesuits. This is one of the most shameful chapters in their history and proves to me that they needed the reformation of the Bible in the vernacular of the people, that they rejected. Yes, it is fiction. The movie is based on a fictional novel by the Japanese author Shusaku Endo. What is clear is that Japan was at that time closed to the outside world, was a feudal system, had decided to reject Christianity, and reverted to reliance on its indigenous belief system, a syncretic mix of Shintō and Buddhism to bring cohesion to the nation and support its totalitarian methods. It is also clear that there was a priest named Ferreira, there was a great persecution of the church, many Jesuit priests apostatized, they trampled on an image of Christ, called a fumie, and Christianity was officially snuffed out for 200 years. The rest is fiction. How much is Endo and how much is Scorsese, I don't know. Beyond the history, which I find fascinating, I look for worldview and inspiration. This movie fails on both points for me. As far as inspiration goes; the opposite is the case. The movie left me disturbed and depressed. As far as worldview goes, there is a lot here but contra many Christian reviews; it was a story of capitulation rather than exaltation and therefore the exact opposite of the Christian message which ends in resurrection, hope and inspiration. I would not recommend this movie unless the person is mature and thoroughly grounded in the faith. It is potentially hazardous to one's spiritual health. I also look for lessons to be learned. I found a few. Totalitarian lessons: In America it is tempting to think of Buddhism as a benign philosophy that helps us relax and meditate; but in reality it can be a dangerous philosophy that can end in totalitarianism just like any other ism when in power. This movie shows this in graphic detail. The Buddhists that controlled Japan in the 17th century were totalitarian and brutal. They tortured their victims. They deserve to be categorized with all the other regimes like Nazism, Communism, Islam, and Catholicism when it contradicted itself etc. Theological Lessons: 1. Apostasy is real. But unless one repents of this, you do not belong to Christ. Holding a crucifix at the end but living a life of compromise with a brutal regime is a ticket to hell,not heaven. Jesus left very clear instructions about renouncing Him,saying: ""Whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven."" (Matt. 10:33) Leaving the faith is not faith. Wecannot accept the decision Rodrigues made and think everything will be okay in the end. This is what makes Silence so potentially dangerous.2. God has spoken in His word and in the person of Christ and His sacrament. Silence is silence. It is the opposite of speaking. It is a Buddhist and eastern non-logical idea that god speaks in silence. Yes,there is a still small voice sometimes, but it is not silence. All of creation is a universe – one symphonic voice and song. 3. Christ would never tell someone to, Trample on Him. He would never say, ""It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men's pain that I carried my cross."" We know this because this is sign of apostasy, not faith. Hebrews 10:28-29 says, ""He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace? Earlier in Hebrews 6:4-6 we read these words, ""For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, If they shall fall away (apostatize), to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.""",Silence

253,outrunkid,One of Scorsese's Best Cinematic Achievements,10,8 January 2017,"Contains Spoilers. I must confess that I went to see Silence purely based on the fact that it was directed by Martin Scorsese and have to admit I was taken aback. Unlike most Martin Scorsese films, Silence does not scream the director's style or technique. The Wolf of Wall Street, Taxi Driver, The Departed to some degree and most certainly GoodFellas, as well as the director's other gems, quite clearly are 'Scorsese' pictures – the fast editing, the tracking camera shots, the amazing variation in shot angles, shot speeds and shot types all seamlessly integrated. Additionally, the material and themes he chooses to deal with are often very specific - the larger-than-life characters, the inner-city violence and brutality, the rise-and-fall story arcs. However, with Silence many of these elements are absent, and often I did not 'feel' that I was watching a Scorsese film. In fact, I was disappointed with this 'diluted' version of Scorsese. The historical setting and epic scale feels somewhat ill-at-ease with Scorsese's style. That said, most of the scenes are fantastically directed. (Spoilers) The opening torture scenes set amid mist are powerfully harrowing – Scorsese does not make the mistake of attempting to create undue sympathy for the victims through the use of close-ups. Instead the wide and medium shots create a sense of detachment within me for the victims and make me feel more like an observer for these horrendous acts rather than an audience member who is being aimed at by the film-maker to create tension for. By the term 'epic scale' I mentioned earlier, I do not mean large scale battles or thousands of extras marching across a field – instead I mean the vast wild and ancient environments, which are beautifully shot and photographed. (I sincerely believe that Silence should be in with a very big chance of going all the way to winning the Best Cinematography Academy Award). Perhaps also one can apply the term 'epic' to such a film through the monumentally powerful themes of religion, questioning one's deity and persecution of faith that are present in every scene. It is through these themes where the film's essential elements lie – it is the underlying drive of the film and one feels this is the reason why Scorsese has been attracted to this project. Indeed, the fact that Scorsese also co-wrote the film as well as directing and has been attached to Silence since the early 1990's, tells just how important the themes portrayed here really are to him. Religion has always been a very strong aspect in many of Scorsese's films but never the indispensable factor that drives the story as it is here. Essentially, Scorsese's films are primarily character driven and this one most definitely is. It is the main character's questioning of his faith and what it means to deny religion for the 'greater good' that kept me watching throughout. Although it is present throughout the movie, it is the scenes where these themes are the main focus point where I feel Scorsese has done some of his best work, perhaps ever. Overall, the film is not 'interesting'. It didn't get my heart beating or keep me on the edge of my seat with excitement. Instead, the emotional and mental concern for the struggles of the characters throughout, and the constant uncertainty about people's beliefs, is what kept me hooked. Andrew Garfield's acting varies I feel in places, but overall is solid enough to sustain the film. Adam Driver I feel is the stronger of the two at times. Liam Neeson's performance though is extremely strong and throughout did not, in my opinion, put a foot wrong, and has produced of the very best performances of his career and of the year. At least he has shown the world he is not just capable of terrible action films – this is a Neeson who is incredibly powerful and world weary. Although this is not a 'Scorsese style' film, it really is visually impressive at times, and not just through cinematography. It is change of pace and expectation from one of the very best film director's in history, but it must stand as one of his best cinematic achievements.",Silence

255,nhojnivra,just like going through the hurting pits of hell,7,13 March 2017,"Painfully long. After his long years being a director, for me Silence is just one of Scorsese's gradually absorbing films and more of a boredom despite its promising cast, but it is indeed a heartfelt drama.Again, don't get me wrong, watching the Silence is just like going through the hurting pits of hell, but, in a good way, as this is what the film wants us to feel as we watch these tormented Christians.Another thing I like is when the narrator asks questions in his prayer, and especially when he questioned his prayer being sent to silence, that part, I'm sure that most of us felt that way before, the feeling of hopelessness to the point that we question the existence of God.Liam Neeson's presence can hardly be felt in this film, but I think that's just fine, Andrew Garfield's sincere portrayal of his character brought life to a dying but a martyr priest.Director Martin Scorsese once studied becoming a priest, however, he ended up being a friar in the cinematic world, an angel to some, thus saying, it's not really new to a Scorsese film to include any references to Christianity. Aside from this movie being about the two primary priest, it can be noticed that some stories or aspects of the Bible are being interpreted: Sinners (in this film it was the villagers protecting Christianity) being crucified ; the betrayal of Kichijiro (Yozuke Kubozuka) which is similar to Judas to Jesus ; Father Rodrigues denying Jesus similar to Peter in the Bible and many more.Though the movie breaks every enthusiasm in you and promises no sweet conclusion, Silence is not about who's good and who's evil, it's more about creating a balance between beliefs while showing respect to each factions. Silence places one of the most important query of life: ""How Far Will You Go Protecting What You Believe?"". It may not have the same charisma compared to The Passion Of The Christ (2004), it still delivers its message of faith, sacrifice and trust to our creator.",Silence

As others have indicated, the themes in this work are repetitive, disengaged and monolithic.What this film does do is point to the nature of Spirit. And how man's ideological impositions are, in the words of Shakespeare, ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"".What we witness is the huffing and puffing of Christian zealots attempting to 'support the faith' in Japan. Apparently, without any real understanding of the nature of the established religion, Buddhism, and by extension, no great depth of appreciation of the core of their own faith.The remorseless churning by way of persecution of the non-apostates is in itself a message of consistency.

To believe in something with no reward or proof or to dedicate a life to higher presence is beyond my comprehension.certain elements of this movie gave me a sort of blind leading the blind viewpoint. Such a well acted and written story with very good screenplay and understanding of a certain eastern toleration of faith was very educational. I didn't expect this from martin Scorsese. If your interested in learning and culture or have a belief in Christianity or Buddha this movie should be a good watch for you. It was long winded but in my eyes needed to be.

258,KingKongKyle,"""The Price For Your Glory Is Their Suffering""",9,18 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese's new drama was not designed to be easy on its audience. Silence is a dark tale of violence and persecution that raises many questions about faith and martyrdom, but doesn't pretend to have the answers to those questions. This is what makes the film so profound. Those that consider themselves very religious will find sympathy and outrage at the circumstances displayed. Those that are not religiously- minded, or that consider themselves atheist or agnostic, will find it unfathomable that people can treat each other in such ways over religion- or that people would be willing to die for their god. The question at the core of Silence is ""While you may be willing to die for your faith, are you willing to allow others to die for it?"" Silence does not pretend that there is a right or wrong answer to this question, instead it gives you the results of the decisions made by these specific characters-and allows you to ponder and decide for yourself what right and wrong is, or you may decide there isn't a right or wrong. Either way, I don't believe anyone can leave a viewing of Silence unaffected.As a movie, I went in a little worried. I had read that it was long and deliberately slow. But I didn't find this to be the case. While it is long, at 2 hours and 41 minutes, I did not feel that the film dragged, nor did it feel like it was too long. In fact, I was so enthralled by the characters on screen, I didn't really want it to end. At the same time, as much hardship is displayed on screen, the film needed to end-before it induced some semi-permanent depression on its audience. I guess what I'm saying is, if you're a fan of mature, thought-provoking movie-making, don't let the lengthy run-time scare you. Long-time Scorsese-collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker proves once again why she is one of the best film editors in the business. She's been doing this for fifty years now (according to IMDb), and Silence is one of her finest works yet. Not a single scene feels unnecessary or tacked on. Even though she already has three wins (The Departed, The Aviator, Raging Bull), I hope the Oscars don't leave her out this year.As for the cast, there's several award-worthy performances on display. Andrew Garfield is having quite the year. He's already been Golden Globe- nominated for his excellent turn in Hacksaw Ridge. But I believe his work in Silence is even better. His character has to deal with an intense crisis of faith, and it has to feel real or the film simply wouldn't work. Garfield makes this look effortless. The supporting actors, including Adam Driver, Liam Neeson and Ciarán Hinds all bring their A- game. The Japanese cast is also top-notch. Yoshi Oida, Shin'ya Tsukamoto, Yôsuke Kubozuka and Tadanobu Asano are all memorable. It's Issei Ogata as Inoue the Inquisitor who I really wish was in the awards conversation this year. His performance is humorous at times, bordering on just a bit hammy, but his character is so evil that these things only make him more despicable.The film is also a gorgeous production. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is stunning. The costume and set designs give you a real sense of time and place, transporting you to world few films have gone and even fewer have made look this authentic.As for the star behind the camera, Martin Scorsese is one of those directors we've come to hold to a higher standard. Like Steven Spielberg or Francis Ford Coppola, when their films aren't great it is more noticeable-simply because these filmmakers have given us so many classics we hold in high esteem. Thankfully, Scorsese does not disappoint. At 74, he's delivered one of his most technically ambitious features. While Silence may not be as entertaining or re-watchable as some of his past efforts, it is certainly one his most thought-provoking and important films. Movie-goers also shouldn't let the ""Scorsese-brand"" worry them as far as the film's content. The film does feature some very intense scenes of torture and violence. But there is nothing in the way of profanity nor sex/nudity.Those going to Silence looking to be entertained may be disappointed. Not all films are designed to entertain. Some are made to promote thoughts and conversations about important subjects like religion, war and prejudice. Films like Schindler's List and Apocalypse Now come to mind; movies that you may not see over and over again-but that everyone should watch at least once. Silence may be difficult to watch at times. It can be faith-assuring or faith-shaking depending on what you take away from it. But like those other films I mentioned, it is a film everyone should see at least once.",Silence
259,greg-32117,High hopes but it left me cold,2,19 February 2017,"In brief, this movie to ENDURE, not ENJOY.It is just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY. TOO. LONG. Three hours of relentless torture, persecution, despair, poverty, brutality, murder, betrayal, and then more of the same, was just too much, and Scorsese really should have made a 60 minute documentary rather than a movie. Yes, there are moments of lightness (two, we counted), and a brief sequence of hope and purposes where one of the padres felt like he was making a difference to the bleak poverty of the lives of Japanese villagers. Other than that, this movie is one inevitable, ghastly, slow slide to apostasy. On occasions, Mr Scorsese, I want my movies to give hope, humour, courage and good things, and your movie gave none of those.I had high hopes for this: Neeson, Garfield and Scorsese made it an attractive proposition. However, an hour into the movie and I was ready to leave. The plot was muddy and laborious, and Scorsese insisted on showing us short imagistic fragments that led nowhere.Two last gripes. Firstly, the idea that medieval rural Japanese villagers would be able to speak English (or Portuguese as the narrative language) is ridiculous. Secondly, why oh why did Scorsese make us sit through the credits before the house lights came on? A few more minutes of tedium? Whatever you wanted, it didn't work.It gets 2/10 for the cinematography and nothing else.Unless you are a fan of medieval Japanese torture and murder techniques, don't both watching this. Some movies stay with you for days, weeks, months, a lifetime. This one you will want to forget asap and move quickly to something more edifying.",Silence
260,Rosebud815,Five bags of popcorn,10,27 February 2018,"Silence is a beautiful, yet grueling story about a priest going through great trials of pain that test his faith. A search for a apostatized Father turns into a search for God that transcends religion due to how personal Scorsese portrays . The hope and faith that the Japanese people show towards Andrew Garfield lets me feel the beauty of being and warmth of being alive. Yet the impossibility of the task of the Japanese to truly understand the religion and the hatred shown towards priests by the Japanese rulers shows the division between what is felt within the self and the reality of the external world. Recognizing this division and accepting it is a maturation that Neeson and Garfield's characters had to go through hell to understand. The worst parts of life on Earth consistently cause doubt in whether or not the most nebulous and beautiful tendencies of being human are real or not. Such concepts have definitely been explored before, but never as organically as with the pious manner in which Silence is portrayed. Before viewing Silence, I didn't know it was really possible to so subtly and wonderfully tell a story transcendent amongst all religions and all people around the world through religious figures, but Scorsese did it. The film's setting swims through bouts of fog, warmth and cold nothingness, mystically affecting the mood of the film. Silence is a challenging film to watch, but pays off like nothing else. The struggle of Andrew Garfield's character through the brutality of Japan is an extreme representation of the burden beared being a human on Earth. Witnessing death for ridiculous reasons, pain, starvation and distance all due to such trivial desires and misunderstandings. In God's Silence throughout the Fathers' immense struggle, they found their Lord within them the whole time, but absent externally. This discovery was a haunting reckoning, but it showed them how no one can carve the world in their vision, and that in doing so will drive a person mad. However unfortunate, the aspects of existence as shown in Silence are a part of human nature, and the kind of silence that Garfield and Neeson's characters maintain throughout the rest of their lives is the human equivalent to the burden Jesus bore on the cross. It's carrying the pain that's inherently going to be felt by traversing life on Earth, and realizing all that can be done is to keep what is felt within them, and express it in whatever ways possible.",Silence
261,mydistracteduniverse,Silence - Martin Scorsese opens 2017 with a bang,10,7 January 2017,"Google Image It is 2017 and Martin Scorsese starts the year with a bang. Or rather with Silence. I am usually not one to make predictions but if that movie doesn't get an Oscar nod then I don't know what will.Never have I seen a movie theatre full with people turn absolutely still. Nobody moved. Nobody breathed. Something akin to an electric current ran through me. The silence in the room when the pivotal scene came up was absolute. To experience anything like this is an incredible feeling and an homage to the director.Andrew Garfield was never an actor I paid much attention to in the past. In Silence he gave an outstanding performance. He incidentally also plays in Hacksaw Ridge, a role for which he got nominated for a Golden Globe. That movie is on my watch list and at last it will soon be released in Ireland. I am very much looking forward to seeing it.The MissionTwo Jesuit priests learn that their mentor Father Cristóvão Ferreira, who is living in Japan to spread the word of God, denounced his faith and committed apostasy. We are shown the torture of his followers by the Japanese in Nagasaki. The story is set in the 1630s and 1640s, when Japan is trying to root out all foreign influences in religion and Christians in the country are killed by the tens of thousands.Father Sebastião Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Father Francisco Garupe (Adam Driver) feel in their hearts that God needs their help. Despite the danger that awaits them they head out to Japan to find Father Ferreira and see if the allegations are true. They are committed to continue the missionary work in a country that has become so dangerous for Christians.Upon their arrival they are found by some villagers who follow the Christian faith in secret. Hidden from the inquisitors during the day, the two priests come out at night to perform church services, hear confessions and baptise the people. They give hope to the villagers and give them strength to continue with their faith in the face of great peril.Keeping the faithThe two priests are forced to witness the torture and prosecution of the villagers. Only their faith helps them through those dark times. Eventually though they are captured. Father Garupe is killed and Father Rodrigues finds that the harder he prays the less answers he gets from God. God has become silent. In this silence he struggles to come to term with what he witnesses barely holding on to his believes.Until he meets Father Ferreira. As it turns out the rumours were correct. Father Ferreira is now studying at a Buddhist temple and has a Japanese wife and family. How will Father Rodrigues cope with this new revelation?Final ThoughtsAs someone who does not and never has subscribed to any kind of religion I don't understand this kind of faith or the willingness to kill and die for something as abstract as a deity. To me it is quite horrific to see what people are willing to do to other beings in order to force their own ways and believes upon each other. I watched Silence days ago but I really struggled with putting all of this into words on short notice.Belief and faith or not, even to me the struggles that Father Rodrigues went through seem so real. I can certainly appreciate the emotional conflict he went through having to see his fellow Christians being tortured and killed. To watch this being done to another being must provoke some reaction in anyone. Andrew Garfield's performance is just incredible. His grief, his doubts, his brush with insanity. It is all so real.Martin Scorsese's vision for this film has famously had about 25 years time to develop and the end result really shows the passion he put into the movie. Silence certainly opened the new movie year in a spectacular fashion.",Silence
262,resireg-31415,A history lesson,10,9 September 2017,"I just watched today at Netflix a great masterpiece, and the best part of the movie is not the acting, the direction, the themes but the story itself. We follow the paths of two very determined Jesuits who are living in Macau-China, and they volunteer to investigate the disappearing of their former teacher and mentor Father Ferreira in Japan. There are rumors that he abandon his religion, and the two young priests want to see with their own eyes whether its is true or not. Japan is a changed country in the late 17th century, and now being a Christian is considered illegal, and whoever is accused of being Christian is punished by prolonged torture followed by slow and painful death (like crucifixion, drowning, burning, etc). We get the sense that their mission is doomed, but what surprises us and bring us some pleasant moments in this movie, is the positive reception the priests receive from impoverished peasants and fishermen, who lived a life of eternal oppression, and were ready to sacrifice themselves for their Chirstian faith, since it promised hope for a better life after death, in a country with no hope where a few wealthy barons ruled over the starving masses.So the movie focus on the lose-lose situation where the priests are stuck. Their heart says that they need to look for the remaining Chirstians, and keep their faith alive, but this is only bringing death, since the Japanese authorities are destroying every single village visited by the pair, and their mind says they should try to save as many lives as possible, since there will be no disciple left if the murdering spree doesn't stop, but in order to do that, they are blackmailed by the authorities who order them to spit on crosses, and stomp on religious images. The idea is make them role models and use their examples to reconvert people back to Buddhism, which is the only religion allowed.It is a choice between saving lives versus saving souls. They meet their former mentor Father Ferreira, now a Buddhist, who says that it is useless to bring European concepts to Japan, since the power structures would never allow any foreign idea, whether positive or negative, to make an impact in the country. I watched the movie cheering for the main character all the time, even though we know now trough history that they lost the fight (Japan has virtually no Christians, even today), but for a brief time it seemed like a miracle could happen in the Asian nation",Silence

He does. That's it. No great revelation, no vision, no martyr's death. He just recants, and spends the rest of his life helping the Japanese.Does he work in secret, behind the scenes, does he really use his new found status to spread the word? No. At the end he just dies, is cremated as a Buddhist, and his wife slips a small crucifix into his dead hand, but we get the impression that it's for him, not for her, or for any Christians who remain, if indeed there are any.It's a beautifully shot, detailed and accurate film of failure, with no redeeming qualities of redemption. If the Priest recanted to save tortured Christians, well this is never developed, and we never see even a trace of an underground Church, growing in power and size. They came, they saw, they failed.

265,rushmoras,"Look at them - they hate you, yet you come to save them.",6,19 February 2017,"Went to the movies today to watch this film without any particular knowledge on the subject. Just knew that it will be a historical movie about a Christian priest getting stranded on Japan.After watching the movie I came to these conclusions: 1) This Martin Scorsece's film is serious and very much so. It depicts a story about a priest from Portugal - a one Father Fererra (Liam Neeson) - during the time of persecution of Christians in Japan, about how he was forced to disavow his faith for the sake of saving the lives of others. And how after a couple of years two Portugal priests will share the same faith that Father Fererra had.2) There's a lot of Christian undertones in the movie, and at times it seems too much of them for a person, who is not entirely religious. A lot of convergence of the main protagonist - Father Rodriguez (Andrew Garfield) - with the trials and tribulations of Jesus Christ. And, as Father Fererra in the movie so said - and I am paraphrasing it - ""These men are not suffering from hubris to think of their suffering as Jesus's suffering, but you do. Will your pride get the better of view and you will suffer as Jesus had suffered and let these poor souls die?"" 3) I don't know much about the history of Japan apart the basics that I was taught in school many years ago, but it would have been nice to have an introduction in the movie as to why the Christians were prosecuted. The unfamiliar with history viewer will just have to suffice with the answer that it just the way it is. Was it due to Opium Wars? Again, we do not know, because it's never explained in the movie.4) The movie is very lengthy and monotonous. The same faith crisis of the main protagonist and his mentor is seen throughout the movie. And the same question is questioned through the length of it - will you disown your faith so others may live? How strong is your faith? While these monotonous introspection are sometimes enlivened - if one could say so - with some pretty graphic execution scenes, but the very tone of the movie remains the same through the length of it: a lot of melancholy mixes with rain.I rate this movie a six out of ten. Again, if I was of a religious type, I may like it more, but even though this is a Scorece's film, it does not warrant to watch it a second time, at least in my opinion.",Silence

The subject matter of Japan in the 1600's as Japan is introduced to Western Culture and Christianity is ripe for an in depth and detailed portrait of the clash between Bushido and Western thought, and is well documented- elsewhere. I was expecting a more detailed study of the resistance to Christianity by Japanese culture of the time to preserve the order of Bushido. Nowhere in the film are the traditional concepts of Bushido and Budhism represented in the film, except for implicitly.The movie seemed to force the viewer to the conclusion that Christianity was the best thing for Japan without explaining how Christianity was in-congruent with Japanese Culture and Social Structure of the time. I began to wonder, are the beliefs implied by this movie born out empirically? A quick survey of Modern Japan today says no. Despite all the strife of the Christian Missionaries in ""Silence"", a mere 1% of Japanese are Christian today. Apparently the writers overlooked core Japanese culture in the making of this movie. A more pertinent theme would take place in the Modern Middle East where massive numbers of Christians are being murdered in the modern world and ignored by the Media. The case of a few Missionaries in Japan back in the 1600's is intriguing only if we study and compare the influences of Bushido and Christianity to the Social/Political normalities of the time.The 1980's Mini Series Shogun delivered this and far more drama than you'll ever find in ""Silence"".",Silence
268,mickclarke48,A Painful Silence,8,8 January 2017,"Set amongst the Christian persecutions of 17th century Japan ""Silence"" is Scorsese's most cerebral film and ,one senses ,his very personal exploration of humankind's apparent need to believe in some kind of ultimate being and the mental and physical anguish that can often attend that belief.The cruelly sadistic scenes of torture/martyrdom are juxtaposed with the priest's own doubts about the existence and the nature of God and whether he and this God are in someway complicit in the suffering of these poor people .In many cases he has to suffer vicariously by being forced to watch the torments of others.Father Rodrigues' dark night of the soul often references/imitates Christ's own passion, with the crucifixion of the three hostages,his entry into town on a donkey ,the mirror image in the river, his betrayal by his guide Kichjiro on at least three occasions,and the Caiaphus style examination by the Inquisitor. This scene for me was reminiscent of The Bridge on the River Kwai's debate between Colonels Nicholson and Saito on their differing codes of honour ,illustrative of the parallel theme of an additional cultural /political clash, suggestive of western arrogance and colonialist aspirations:this continues to resonate powerfully in today's conflicted world. The Inquisitor's performance for me was impressive-the rest of the acting good but not great.The dialogue is of varied quality-the priest's verbal jousts with the Inquisitor excellent and revealing- but other episodes less so.There is also a fair bit of repetition with the priest's self examinations and the many apostatical ceremonies.The cinematography is stunning, with the various miasmas,(mists from the mountains/ haar from the sea/vapours from the hot springs), mimicking the fog of doubt enfolding father Rodrigues.At 2 hrs 40 it is also a bit too long, but ultimately it is a moving experience and an intense and complex work that should keep you thinking long after the credits roll .I will go see it again.",Silence
269,alpha-73032,Pride and prejudice and pretension,2,29 March 2017,"I hate only lies. And the reason I'm not a Christian is that I've read the Bible carefully. It says that the Pharisee Saul of Tarsus took over the church after the crucifixion and converted followers of Jesus into Pharisees. The only Gospel saying Jesus called himself Christ is John's, and Matthew's and Mark's say that Jesus told John he didn't understand what Jesus tried to teach. The Pharisees were a Judaic sect that interpreted Judaic prophesies that a descendant of David's would resurrect the kingdom of Judah to mean that he would resurrect people. The origin of the word ""christ"" is a Greek word meaning anointed as one anoints kings while the origin of the word ""messiah"" is a Hebrew word meaning the same. Saul of Tarsus used the word ""Christ"" to preach the notion of a new king of the Jews beyond Jerusalem through Greece to Rome. And he used the example of Jesus' humility to propagandize people into bowing to the church he founded. And Jesuits have extended that hypocrisy all over earth. Buddhists believe that eternal life is simple truth. They believe all differences are illusion. HITRT",Silence

Not only is this not convincing it is also impossible if the Catholic priests themselves (Historically speaking) were Portuguese. It is only when one tries to forget about this huge error that one can focus on the 'losing one's religion' plot of the story. The latter is done very well and the only reason why I was able to sit through the entire movie. The other issue that I had with this movie was the length.

This movie could have been a great one but it wasn't, it was a complete waste of time. Listening to people talk about it while leaving the theater helped me realize I wasn't the only one who thought this was garbage.

The story follows two priests who travel into Japan in search for mentor who has apparently denounced his faith publicly. This movie's story is hard to watch because our main characters are broken down down so emotionally throughout the movie. What this movie does really well is questioning the audience what it means to question authority and faith. Throughout the movie this is a common theme and it's played out so well. Andrew Garfield plays out his part so well, a performance matching that of Hacksaw Ridge. Yôsuke Kubozuka is also very very good in this movie, playing a person who's been tortured so much and has had so much taken away from him because of his faith. The cinematography is beautiful in this movie as well. Rodrigo Prieto makes every shot beautiful and detailed. He also worked on The Wolf of Wall Street so it seems that Scorsese and Prieto are a good match. My only flaw with this movie is the run time. The movie clocks in at about 2 hours and 45 minutes long, which is very very long for most audiences. It didn't effect me but there were a few people in my theater that walked out at about the 2 hour mark.

Maybe this is the ideal preparation for contemplation, for prayer, and, ultimately, for death and what it might bring.There is a clear construct of oppositions like Buddhism vs. Christianity, perception vs. imagination, protectionism vs. imperialism, immanence vs. transcendence or the denial of vs. the faith in the creative power of symbols. But it's hard to figure out the films own attitude regarding these sides, and this is what makes it a work of art in contrast to a work of religious or political propaganda. The conflicts within the story and its characters are numerous and dig deep, and the filmmakers manage to tell them without praising one side and condemning the other side.

Some of his movies are violent, erotic, and filled with history. The movie Silence is a particular one, due that the lack of violence, erotism and the rapid movement of the camera shows us another version of this great director. You may call it an apology of Christianity or a complaint against this religion. But the fact is that this movie shows us when 2 great religions find each other: Budhism and Christianism. Both religions teach peace, but their essence is completely different:Buda is a state where all men can become and then be happy and become one with God Salvation comes with the knowledge of true love to be happy with GodThere is a slight difference in those religions. The movie explains it so well, that it may help you (if you believe) to realize what your religion is about. If you aren't religious then is a cultural knowledge to understand this religions. The movie is about jesuit ""padres"" that go to Japan to evangelize a new and unexplored civilization. After 20 years, the missionaries are being put to death in the most horrid ways ever, for altering the peace and destroying the cultural and religious identity of the country.

Scorsese gets a far better performance from Garfield than Gibson could in the wreck 'Hackwsaw Ridge'.Where the film falls down is in the dull and long-winded script. Paced in a ""and then and then and then"" fashion. Making the film a chore to sit through.Sadly, the film resorts to incongruent narration in the 3rd act in order to wrap things up. It feels like a last minute editing decision to prevent the film from being four hours long.It's a religious-zeal gore fest of unending brutality and suffering.

It is impossible to capture the nuances of the faith. The grief over the beheading was a bit much. What were they expecting? The emotional outbursts of the priests are a bit much. Martyrs go to their deaths singing and rejoicing. God is not silent. He speaks to the heart for those willing to hear. The silence should be from the priest.

I'm not criticizing the actors here, nor anything else that has to do with movie-making; only the subject matter stinks. Why should we care about gangsters, old-style mafia-like ones, or even white-collar worse ones? If it is to inform us, then fine, but again, I don't give a damn. Silence screams at you with its imagery and truth. Yes, truth! It's truth that transcends the so-called truth that we are supposedly looking for. What truth? Look around! The truth is out there. No, it's not, when most of us wouldn't even know how to recognize it. It takes artists (only referring to those in cinema here) like Chaplin, Allen, Kubrick, and others, and now, Scorsese, to give us a glimpse of the truth. Many of us are scared of the truth.

286,cinesiteforever,Beautiful and exhausting,9,30 April 2017,"Martin Scorsese's latest film can be included in his most personal works, in his impenitent quest for the truth of faith, the purest and universal religious belief, through the tortuous and biblical path followed by his main protagonist, Father Rodrigues (played by a magnificent Andrew Garfield). The story of two Portuguese Jesuits who travel to Japan in the seventeenth century in search of their mentor, is narrated brilliantly by Mr. Scorsese, although his style is closer to the leisurely pace of ""The Age of Innocence"" than to the nervous rhythm characteristic of his main filmography. However, this does not imply the loss of a palpable tension from the first moments of the film when the character played by Ciarán Hinds warns the two young Jesuits of what they are going to suffer and suffer in their search for the father Ferreira. We can not fail to mention the proximity of this story to the religious concerns that were manifested in another very important work of Scorsese, ""The Last Temptation of Christ."" And in the infinite and unbearable search for religious faith, the human being ends up being, in the last analysis, a common human, with the doubts and weaknesses that we have along the way towards the clarity of the most mundane things. This is one of the best works done by Martin Scorsese, and almost without hesitation, we are in front of his more personal journey towards the hells of humanity. The best: the set of actors (particularly Andrew Garfield and Issey Ogata), and the monumental photography by Rodrigo Prieto. The worst: the film can be interpreted as a lesson in Christianity when it tries to show us the reaction of humanity within a religious context.",Silence

289,thechoctopfilmblog,"Eerily fantastic, explores a heavy subject matter in its rawest form",8,13 February 2017,"Silence was eerily fantastic. Based on the 1966 novel by Shusaku Endo, it explores a very heavy subject matter and does so in its rawest form. Set in 17th century Japan, two Catholic priests, Fathers Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver), begin their journey to find their missing mentor Father Ferreira (Liam Neeson). At the time, Christians in Japan were under severe persecution by the Shogunate and many went into hiding to avoid torture and execution. Director Martin Scorsese tells the story in a very unique way. He lets the audience witness the grim details of the physical and mental suffering the Christians endure through from the very first frame. It is very difficult and uncomfortable to watch, and that dreadful feeling lingers and persists during the entire film.What's really fascinating about this film is that Scorsese built the film around the theme of Silence. There is no music in the film in the traditional sense. The score (Kathryn Kluge and Kim Allen Kluge) comprises almost entirely of insect noises and chirping of birds. The audience, like Rodriguez and Garrpe, are left vulnerable and there is nothing to distract us from the brutality that is being depicted. Darkness is a common theme here, both figuratively and literally. Many scenes are set at night, or in a hidden hut lit by candlelight, with people talking in fearful whispers. If we dig deeper, Scorsese presents many 'Why' questions around God's silence to the Christians' sufferings and it doesn't readily divulge the answers. The viewers mainly follow and see things through Garfield's perspective (quite literally through Rodrigo Prieto's brilliant cinematography) and after being part of what he goes through, we are compelled to raise the same doubts and questions as him – questions such as: What is faith? What is strength? Should you deny God to save others? Like him, the audience's willpower is chipped away little by little as the film progresses, and I could feel myself approaching my breaking point too. The film does tone down past the half way point, with its intensity dissolving slightly. Or was this because we are somewhat used to the violence at that point? The screenplay spends the majority of the film dissecting and delving into Garfield's emotional realm. They do this slowly and painfully, and for the viewers, it could feel a little wearisome. I found though, that this was all part of the process. Scorsese was merely preparing us for the much anticipated encounter between two central characters in the climax. By that point, it is easy to be fully engrossed in the conversation, and it is powerfully sincere and heartbreaking, as we could understand both characters' thoughts and motivations. After his exceptional performance in Hacksaw Ridge, Garfield gives another heartfelt performance here. Neeson's role as a mentor reminded me of his character as Qui-Gon, with his quiet maturity and perceived respectability and wisdom. Even with their limited screen time, the Japanese actors, in particular Issei Ogata as the Inquisitor Inoue and Yosuke Kubozuka as Kichijiro are incredibly memorable. Inoue's creepy voice would stay with me for a long time to come. Scorsese' Silence deliberately uses silence to punctuate its impact. It puts you through trials and tribulations and when you finally absorb everything, you'll feel extremely sick. At almost three hours running time, it is long and it takes a fair degree of patience and resilience to sit through. Regardless of Scorsese's intentions and what his message is, this film forces you to be in touch with your humanity and that's in my opinion, achieved brilliantly.",Silence

Featuring stunning cinematography of the lavish '17th-century Japan' and powerful raw performances from stellar Andrew Garfield, Yosuke Kubozuka, Adam Driver, and all the cast alike, the storyline was thoroughly engaging and impeccably executed by Scorsese and team. The film's length acts as a strength in the narrative, encapsulating fully the purposely drawn-out travels of Rodrigues and Garupe, and despite it's length I was utterly engrossed through the film. Sound plays a key thematic role in this film, having a heavy influence on scenes sometimes more-so than the dialogue; the only thing that irked me were the rough-cut voiceovers, especially in one key scene with Garfield, however it is easy to look pass. The film ultimately provokes thoughts galore on faith, humanity and humility, and you will be left pondering and shocked at the religious persecution presented on the screen.

Unless you're catholic, the theme of this film is simply out of date and the questions it asks are antiquated. As many have pointed out, a more contemporary question to ask today for this story would have been what the hell the Jesuits were doing in Japan in the first place. I know Scorcese touches on that, but the problems is that it amounts to little else than an obstacle to overcome for the main character in his struggle with his faith. The film does devote some time towards understanding the position of the Japanese authorities, but this is a completely toothless concession as the film simultaneously refrains from looking at any ulterior motives of the church or the foreign powers' interests in Japan. The only major question that is asked about the priests concern their faith in god, and that movie has already been made hundreds of times before. A less introspective perspective could have made this story actually interesting, but as it stands, it feels like a film from the 80s, a throwback to Scorcese's 'The Last Temptation'. Indeed Scorcese probably should have made this film half a century ago, and it might have been his 'The Mission', but as it stands, it just doesn't feel relevant any more.",Silence
294,blayzer_trayl,Most will find this movie boring!! So its for those interested in psychology of faith.,7,28 January 2017,"Most people will find this movie incessantly boring. And to the average movie going public it will be.The story starts with Liam Neeson. As a Priest he is stuck under arrest in Japan witnessing the torture of many newly converted native Japanese Christians. This then cuts to two young catholic priests: Andrew Garfield (Spiderman) & Adam Driver (Star Wars) discussing with a senior member of the church on a attempted rescue missions of Priest Neeson (or as he is known Father Ferriera). This is because word got back via a letter after some years that he had rescinded on his christians beliefs. The two younger Padres simply cannot believe this - as he was the man who brought them to their faith. They want to save him - not just physically but for his soul too. Therein their adventure ..or more misadventure ..begins. For the next 2 hours they trek to Japan to find him.I would say this movie is only really for those who are interested in the psychology of faith or have a view about it. They will maybe find some interest in the examples and questions it raises.This is a story about the prostelyzing Western Christianity pitted against 17th century Japanese Bhuddism. The Japanese are very hostile to it and want to hunt down & purge this ""alien faith"" out of their shores. (However, it could easily be a story of any dominant belief system pitted against a minority one)This movie has some connotations to todays religious devotees. Most current in the news being Islam. Certain sects are fanatically faithful to their ways and interpretations of Islam. I am Muslim - so I can relate to some of the tests these Christians face in this movie.The basic test asked by the Japanese Bhuddist is: ""step on this image of Christ if u don't want to get executed"" - to the average laymen its probably laughable. But you would have to imagine what if you were imprisoned and asked to spit on and shred something scared to you. ie your last ever picture of your family.Apostasy and blasphemy isn't much of an issue in Christian communities anymore but its very much prevalent in certain muslim communities. This would be a viable test of faith to apply to a Muslim stepping on the pages of the quran for example. A devotee would be hard pressed to do it.In the movie those who can't do it are brutalised to death. Those who can, let go as an example to others. This, the two western priests, have to witness being done to their new Japanese converts at great personal anguish and pain. It's a test even to their own faith.I won't talk anymore about what occurs further into the movie. You will have to watch to find out if they find Father Ferreira. And what happens to them.The movie seems to be an amalgam of themes from Last Temptation of Christ (the trials of Jesus), Bridge over the River Kwai (the beat down by Japanese militia) and Apocalypse Now (important figurehead goes astray and somebody must find him)The movie I think asks the question: Is religious faith a good and powerful thing or is it all a bunch of hogwash when put to the test?Are people falsely imbued with a sense of faith in a heavenly paradise when it gives them nothing but pain?I am not sure from which angle Scorscece is aiming at faith here. He is either admiring it or proclaiming those who have it are brainwashed fools. You will have to watch the film to make your own mind up.But Scorscece no doubt finds religion fascinating. If you do then you will get something out of it. If you don't - give it a wide berth and perhaps catch it when its on TV.",Silence

To be brief, the movie is about two, young, 17th century Catholic priests venturing to Japan to find a lost priest. Apparently Catholic priests were not held in high esteem in those days in Japan because the two priests had to go into hiding.I almost turned off the movie at about the half hour point. It was slow going. Eventually it became clear that the priests, and other native Christians, must forsake their religion or die of the Buddhists. To show the priests and the other Christians that they meant business, there was a lot of torturing going on.Anyway, enough. If the viewer is a devout Christian, particularly a Catholic, then the film might have some meaning. It might even be inspirational. To the average joe, it will probably come off as kind of strange.

This film isn't worth its R rating if I remember it correctly it doesn't even swear and the violence is not even all that graphic.

ONE- Martin Scorsese had 26 years to make a masterpiece, and it's not even in his top three best films maybe not even top five. TWO - It was underwhelming at some key moments. Although I have said some harsh words about this film it's still an amazing film, and you should go see it!!!!!!!!",Silence

303,artbookguy,Silence is yet another Oscar-worthy Scorsese master work,10,14 January 2017,"After deciding that I'd go to a Saturday matinée of this Martin Scorsese film, I began to laugh.I knew that I wouldn't have to arrive at the movie theater super early to get dibs on my favorite seat because, seriously, is anyone other than me rushing to the theater to see a film about Christian persecution in 17th Century Japan?""I'll probably have the theater all to myself,"" I thought.As things turned out, I was wrong, but not far off. There were eleven people – including me - in the theater during my viewing of this film. There's good news and bad news in that.The bad news is that based on my very narrow theater experience, millions of people aren't going to see yet another Scorsese masterwork. Pity.The good news is that Scorsese was able to get this film made during a time when it appears that our culture is obsessed with many of the things that run afoul of God, Jesus Christ, faith and everything else that this film is about. It was such a pleasure to sit there in near silence and let this profound piece of film making just wash over me. This is what Martin Scorsese does best. He gives you brilliant storytelling, spectacular cinematography, soul-scouring drama and delicious food for thought that I'm certain will remain with me for months to come.Without question, ""Silence"" should be winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2017 and Scorsese should be Best Director. Few storytellers in the film making arena have his mastery and authority. God bless them, but they just don't.Actors Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver and Liam Neeson are all fantastic as Jesuit priests fighting bloody battles beneath brutal Japanese religious rule. Garfield is certainly worthy of an Oscar nomination here and I continue to be astounded by Driver's total commitment to his roles. Neeson gives us his usual steely reserve that only vaguely hides the moral turmoil brewing beneath.I'm left with so much emotional and mental residue from this film. Scorsese weaves so many themes in this epic screenplay adapted from Shūsaku Endō's novel of the same name published in 1966. You leave asking yourself just what would you do or not do for your faith? Do you have faith? Would you die for your faith? Would you deny Christ? Should you trust God? Where is God? Is He here with me amid the silence? Does His silence mean He's not there?""Silence"" is a deep, beautifully-woven film that Scorsese finally completed after many years of staying the course. One might argue that that mere fact that he got this film made was an act of faith and utter devotion in itself.By the way, I must give some hearty shout-outs to Tadanobu Asano, Yôsuke Kubozuka and other Japanese actors who are simply sublime in this film. I want to see more of these fantastic actors in roles in which they're playing contemporary human beings not primarily defined by their race or culture, but rather their contemporary humanity. But that's a story for another day. No?In short, ""Silence"" is a glorious film that really is the jewel in Martin Scorsese's film making crown. -- Michael K. Corbin, ArtBookGuy.com",Silence
304,twelvehousetwelve,Every Christian Should See This Film,9,19 August 2017,"I only give this film a 9 out of 10 because of the sometimes-quirky dialogue (people didn't say 'Okay' until ca. 1839). But quirk can be overlooked easily enough. Not many films are made which show Christian martyrs, and even less are made which focus on Christian martyrs and their power over their persecutors. SILENCE, a remake of a 1971 film of the same title, shows Christian martyrdom in as powerful a way as the original (and far superior) version of THE WICKER MAN. History buffs will like this film, those who hate Christians and want to see us persecuted will like this film, and Christians who love Jesus will like--nay, love--this film. For this latter crowd, it's a hard film to watch, especially at the end when things go pear-shaped like you would not believe. And, yes, I'll go ahead and say it: this film is light years ahead of the Mel Gibson release about Jesus, especially when you know that the priest responsible for writing the Latin dialogue between the Roman soldiers used the most perverted sentences he could find--or make up as he went along. I'd say 'Enjoy!' but that's just not what SILENCE is at all about.",Silence
305,Bobby_Diesel,Slow but Good,7,15 April 2021,"I was interested in this movie because it's unique environment and period. Luckily, Scorsese's ""Silence"" has some great environments, costumes, and cinematography. This is a great movie for those that are really into great cinematography. I also enjoyed the acting and themes around faith. However, unlike some other people, I unfortunately do not see this movie as a masterpiece.Some problems I had were in the pacing, the first hour or so dragged a bit. A lot of the drag came from a lack of developing tension during the start. The tension was too slow to be engaging. After that hour, the pacing went pretty well because of an increase in tension. Another odd thing that bugged me while watching was a lack of Portuguese language. For Portuguese Jesuits, they seem to lack ability to speak the language, even though the Japanese spoke (for the most part) Japanese. This would have been difficult with the American cast, but for the amount of attention put into period costumes and sets I just wish they dedicated some towards language of their period.I overall enjoyed this movie even with its slow start and even if I did not find this to be a masterpiece, I think a lot of people can get a lot from this move.

Before the movie gets really interesting, about half time, you have to work yourself through a barrage of zealotry. Like, always a favorite amongst believers,: the silence of god as a proof of his presence; this bullshit is so persistent and tiresome. If we are focusing on this nonsense nothing will become of us, that's for sure. So..the movie; interesting story but the moment you start to question the premises, you see a deeply xenophobic( the people from Japan are unable to see and receive the grace of god blah blah) movie.

309,akarmiotis-94922,"Silence is an incredible viewing experience that will reward all, religious or not.",10,5 March 2017,"Martin Scorsese's new passion project Silence is an incredible exploration of human endurance and the lengths with which one will go to protect their faith. On the surface, this may seem a religious film, risking artistic integrity in an attempt to promote Christian living. However, the undoubtedly human story at its heart makes the faith that drives the films characters to risk everything universal as a symbol of freedom.Years in the making, Silence follows two Jesuit priests as they journey to Japan to spread the catholic faith and find their missing mentor. This mission pushes their bodies and their sanity to the limit, unveiling both the strength and the horror humanity is capable of. While marketing has pushed Liam Neeson's role in the film, the true star is Andrew Garfield in an incredible performance that invokes such empathy the audience is left stunned. He is the focal point with which we see man's drive and will, following the risks and sacrifices he makes for what he believes is right. Scorsese brilliantly makes his choices and his faith ambiguous, highlighting the flaws with religious practice along with the joy it can bring. The film is not about faith but about the freedom to choose what you believe in. This film is a detailed examination of humanity and Scorsese has set out a methodical journey for his protagonist, a long and slow paced character study. We feel each struggle and each breakthrough with Garfield; Silence is in many ways an experience and it will leave you trembling. My love for what Scorsese had done is matched only by a desire to lock it away for many years. It simply takes that much out of you.As its name suggests, Silence employs stellar use of atmosphere, the sudden troughs of quiet amidst a sea of frenzied sound recreate the moments of religious realization and wonder for our protagonist, we become sympathetic to his deluded ideas of grandeur threatening to taint his morally sound character. All this complexity is grounded with beautiful visuals that merge realism with subtle stylistic qualities that gives the landscapes of 17th century Japan an almost mythic aura.Silence is extraordinary; the beauty and refinement of the production matched only by the beautiful yet harrowing tale at its core. Scorsese has again created a cinematic masterpiece that will bury itself within your mind for quite some time to come.SWEETVisit https://sweetorsaltedmoviereviews.com/ for more.",Silence

The idea of God's silence is a beautiful concept that is well captured by the directing, the screenplay, and the acting.

312,mainstreet-3,10 all the way!,10,7 December 2019,"Having seen this movie, I decided to wait for a few hours to digest it and see if my opinion changed. After that time, I am more convinced it is a movie is flawless in its single-mindedness, its technical craft, and in its acting, but there are a couple of problems with the film.Its violence is realistic and gut-wrenching, as many have said before. For a time this shock works towards its purpose, and you flinch at every blow. As the movie wears on, however, its relentlessness begins to de-humanize the sacrifice of its main character.As I'm writing this review, I find myself trying to do so without any sort of revelation of my own personal beliefs, and it is difficult. If this were any other character besides Jesus, I'd be simply complaining that I didn't identify or feel any sympathy with the main character, and, consequentially, the suffering and the sacrifice's impact are lessened, and the movie suffers for it.But this is about JAPANESE CHRISTIANS who endured horrific persecution because of their beliefs. Not unlike Christians today who endure persecution from the secular crowd who will one day be ushered into eternal darkness forever. Sobering.I speculate that Scoreses was not interested in humanizing the Japanese, though. The film does not sermonize its message, but simply documents it. If this is what Scoreses intended to do, then he succeded with aplomb.And though this review seems negative, I dont' intend it to be. I rated this film 10 out of 10 stars, and stick by it. It is beautiful, though painful, to watch. It is moving and, in its purpose, it succeeds. I walked into the movie expecting to be blown away, and wasn't, but I was still intrigued, and its made me talk to others and think about my own faith.

313,atroxa,The Cruelty of Men,9,5 March 2017,"In ""Silence"", Martin Scorsese tackles a difficult and rather controversial subject -- Religion. I'm sure many people will see this as a love letter to Christianity, perhaps. That some people never lose their faith. Some may view it as completely anti- Christian. They came to other countries to force their beliefs onto others. I choose to see it as a display of how cruel we can be to each other just for believing in different things.I believe in freedom of religion. You may choose to believe whatever you want as far as I'm concerned, as long as it doesn't involve inflicting pain upon others. We see the cruelty of men in all people, regardless of their faith. Some may choose to use their faith to rationalize using violence. My point is, it doesn't matter what we believe, as long as we treat each other well.As to how the film is shot, directed and edited - this is a masterpiece. It starts off a bit slow, but once it gets going it doesn't stop. Scorsese is firing on all cylinders here. The actors, especially Garfield are all perfect and he could probably have received an Oscar nod, had he not already got one for ""Hacksaw Ridge"".Despite its length, this film never got boring and was a real breath of fresh air. I'm really looking forward to Scorsese's next picture.Grade: 9/10. By an atheist Swede.",Silence

315,maxdbarr,A Valiant Effort,8,13 January 2017,"1- Story: The story follows one of two Porchegese priests who travel to Japan in the 1600s to spread their faith, and find a fellow priest who has been taken captive. The priests we follow, in particular the main one played by Andrew Garfield are not at all well developed. Garfield's character is a blind follower of Christianity, who gives his God credit for everything. Meanwhile, his counterpart, played by Adam Driver, is the classic non-believer who struggles but ultimately stays by the rules. When we are asked to follow these two into, we are given no reason why they are interesting or important to follow. The story suffers for this, with the first two-thirds being very interesting as the story is built and the conflict is introduced, but when we are meant to follow Andrew Garfield's character as the true trials begin, it somewhat deflates.Performances: Though they are not given much to work with from a script perspective, both Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield do a fine job with what is provided, no doubt with help from their director, the great Martin Scorsese. The truly interesting acting comes from the Japanese actors, all of whom have such interesting looks and demeanor, not to mention good acting skill, to create this feeling of unease that puts you in our main characters place. The best part of the entire film is Issei Ogata, who delivers such a strange and intimidating performance that it's incredibly engaging. From the moment he comes on screen, you want to know more, and as you learn, you are only more interested. Craft: So, as I said, the script needs a little work. The two main characters have very little back story, and when we are expected to watch them challenge their beliefs, we have no reason to be on their side, we don't really know what their beliefs mean to them. The dialogue is somewhat stiff as well, but this could be because none of the characters in this film would be speaking English. The directing by Martin Scorsese is masterful, maybe some of his best work. He uses the beautiful and somewhat intimidating ambiance of his setting to make the audience as uncomfortable as the priests, and this works to incredible advantage, with high tension and unease throughout.Entertainment Value: As I've said, the first two-thirds of this film are incredible as we learn about the environment we are in. However, once this is done and the story is really set in motion, it is less interesting, with some characters giving you tastes of excitement, and wonderful direction throughout, but it is not a perfect film that entertains all the way through.Memorability: There are certainly elements of this film that are highly memorable. The performance of Issei Ogata, the brilliant directing and some of the visuals are absolutely breathtaking. But this film is nearly three hours long, and after a time, these elements are not enough to live on in tour mind. It is worth seeing, but don't have your hopes too high.",Silence

317,starlee02,To Believe or Not to Believe?,9,17 February 2017,"To Believe or Not to Believe? (light spoil alert) --- For my lovely people who are curious enough about my humbly arrogant opinion, and thoughts of nonsense.Like any good film, there should be many thoughts and opinions that come with it, I can not say what I saw was what intended, but a good movie does the job of forcing it's audiences to question, which brings to my topic. An idea only became the ""truth"" because enough people speak of it, then we use the ""truth"" to our own selfish reasons. No one genuinely like to be wrong; although, I could be wrong on that. ""It can't be true"" Belief is something that was constantly questioned throughout the film, however it is not what created all the problems. When we are arrogant enough to believe that our idea is the ""truth"" and it would apply to anyone anywhere, then try and push our immature idea onto other people, while confirming to ourselves even further as reward, what have we done to other people? Did he bring peace and comfort to his people, or push them to their deaths. Not everyone who died have died for meaningful reasons. It just makes us feel better to think that they did, therefore reinforces the ""heroic"" belief. We all have the natural resistance for anything forced upon us, so when something is forbidden, we'd all like to try that fruit, even if it causes our death. Like Liam Neeson's character said in the film, the people didn't even have same understanding on what god was as they did because of the language and cultural barrier. So what were they really praying to? Did they want to die for honor, or just to escape a harsh reality? Was it really worth risking his and their lives for? But again, what is? I believe that nothing can be believed as the absolute ""truth"". And if you judge it as carefully as Martin Scorsese did in making the film, you would notice that its not about who is right or wrong. The mere idea is laughable. ""Its just formality"" Words spoken out loud is always misleading, so he finally chooses silence in the end, like a wise Buddhist monk, you see, understanding reality and belief leads people to the same place no matter what you believe. And my opinion stays that going into war and torturing people because they believe in a different fantasy than you are is just as stupid and meaningless as however meaningless and stupid you think the other side is. The film also mostly abandoned music brilliantly, as music is the most easy and obvious way to force emotion. I sat through the entire credit as usual, the only music it had was the music of nature. (On a side note, I don't understand what kind of mistake they could have made to have to bring ADR into this kind of high budget film with a director of perfection.) I'm sorry if you haven't seen the film, although the film is about the journey, not the end, so I haven't spoiled much.

At 2 hrs and 40 minutes I had almost forgotten how the movie started as I was subjected the most boring and incomprehensible dialogue I have ever sat through. I also felt, as another reviewer said, that maybe this was Scorseses own turbulent battle with faith that was being played out on screen. It also had similarities with the world's political position today, taking into account the situation in America and Hungary regarding the movement of people from other cultures and faiths drowning out indigenous religions and customs.

Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), Star Trek: Deep Space NineThe opening to Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets begins with a black screen as we hear the director's voice-over ""You don't make up for your sins in Church, you do it in the streets at your home. The rest is Bullshit and you know it"" While the 1973 film isn't technically his first, it does serve as the perfect opening to the filmmaker's legendary career as it is the first time he made a film that he truly revealed himself in. Focusing on a group of morally adrift people trying to find themselves in a sea of criminal temptations. It's similar subject material found in some of his other films and is emblematic of Scorsese's conflict for some 50 years: the creation and resilience of one's unique identity vs. the laws/rules/obligations that lead to conformity within the rest of society. The legendary filmmaker may venture into different genres and settings but it is the central conflict that runs through them. While certainly a departure in tone, pacing, and characters (Especially from Wolf of Wall Street, which still astounds me how much of a gear shift there is between the two works) his latest historical drama Silence is very much in the same veinIn 17th Century Feudal Japan, two Jesuit Priests Sebastian Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Francisco Garrpe (Adam Driver) are sent from Portugal to find their lost mentor Ferreira (Liam Neeson) who has supposedly apostatized, renounced, the Catholic Faith after suffering through extreme physical and mental torture. For years the Japanese government has banned the teaching and practicing of Christianity on its shore's, leading to execution and torture of followers and Priests of missionary work. Knowing the dangers the two young priests secretly travel to the east coast islands with the help of a drunken guide named Kichijiro (An excellent Mifune-esque Yōsuke Kubozuka) to find any information on their mentor. Kichijiro eventually leads them to small pockets of Christian believers who hide the priests at the risk of their lives. While secretly conducting mass, confessions, and baptisms the two priests feel like they are continuing the church's missionary work for the greater good. However, they also know that they can be found out at any time and face, along with their dedicated followers, unimaginable torture and/or death.Silence is a staggering, emotional, violent, pensive, complex and weighty film that centers on a central conflict that comes with belief: the Silence of a higher power in the face of horrific suffering inflicted on followers. Scorsese has dealt with Catholic themes of morality before and directly faith-based dramas with the controversial The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun but never before has he rendered so unflinchingly on-screen the human conflicts with faith and fallibility of belief. When the film eventually centers on Andrew Garfield's Rodrigues we are put on a journey in a similar scope to Apocalypse Now in showing the effects of being completely out- matched and showing the horrors of inhumanity in stark realism. The focal point is with the notorious inquisitor of Nagasaki, Inoue (A physically unimposing but psychologically brutal Issy Ogata), carries out his orders viciously and sadistically in putting down the foreign religion. Garfield is able to give us an amazingly intense and introspective performance of the young priest who begins to develop a deep crisis of faith in seeing so many Japanese Christians tortured and put to death in the face of God's seeming apathy and silence.The source material, adapted by Scorsese and Jay Cocks, is the 1966 book of the same name by Shûsaku Endô and is a landmark of its time, a lucid meditative journey of the faith solidified, eroded, and perhaps redefined. Scorsese was handed the novel after his aforementioned The Last Temptation of Christ premiered to extreme controversy and acted in Akira Kurosawa's Dreams. He has spent decades since trying to get this passion project to the screen and clearly has brought a personal edge to the work. However, he is also able to make Rodrigues' internal crisis a carefully rendered universal one found in all followers of any belief system. Proving that doubt is a powerful counter punch to faith when pushed to limit.I could go on about Rodrigo Prieto's immaculate camera-work, the outstanding performances from the rest of the Japanese cast (Tadanobu Asano as the Inquisitor's interpreter is another standout, voicing brutal reasoning with an eerie calmness), or the subtle soundtrack and sound design that dares to immerse you in the sounds of nature surrounding the violent events but really I want all those aspects to speak for themselves. Coming in as someone who isn't affiliated with organized religion the film is a fascinating examination of the deep seeded effects of Faith that isn't afraid to question it. There is much to take away from a dense work like this. As with most of the director's work, his characters will do things that you won't agree with or understand, but Scorsese as always presents without judgment between the easy and the right things to do. Sometimes the director doesn't give a sufficient answer, he only asks us to watch in thoughtful and pondering silence.10/10 (A bleak, stark, and deeply personal project of epic introspective scope that seeks to question the nature of Religion and how people internalize it. Frustrating, complicated and perhaps enlightening, just as any Faith-based movie should be.)",Silence

Then they go to the second closest village to the coast they reached, where one of the villagers, extremely fortunate for father Rodrigues, heard about Ferreira, that he knew him at least, because he cannot tell Rodrigues where Ferreira actually is, making the whole scene rather pointlessThen Rodrigues is captured and taken to a place where they do him the favor of BRINGING Ferreira right to him. Ending their 'diligent investigation' that could put Sherlock Holmes to shame...That whole aspect of the movie was just lazy, get past the 'brutality of the tortures' that may make you think the movie is powerful and serious, and you'll see the weak script, at least on this noteWhich brings me to the second reason why I dislike the movie You see, like after ten minutes in Japan, the two fathers simply forgot what their mission was. By the time the movie ends, if you think about it, you'll realize you just watched an ending to a different movie than the one you initially thought you were watchingLet's be clear, their mission was not to convince the inquisitor to turn catholic, their mission was not to celebrate clandestine masses, their mission was not to tell captives whether to die defending their beliefs or not. And yet, ten minutes into the island and those are the (only) events that start unfolding.It even has a few debates(why?) between the fathers and some villagers, that guard that beheads a prisoner, and the inquisitor. How they shouldn't have cut the roots(?) for Catholicism to spread, how Japan is to blame because it is a swamp(?) where nothing grows, etc, etc. So what? Why should they care? They shouldn't have wasted their breath. They weren't there to impose their views, or to try to convert them.They were there to GET Ferreira!It was made clear since the beginning that if they found Ferreira alive, and that he was indeed an apostate, that they would absolve him and return to Portugal, the endAnd yet... Rodrigues finds Ferreira, sees he's an apostate, and what happens? they engage in another religious debate. Seriously, why? You found him, father, the mission is over, it was a failure, but it's over. Time to go home, well, you can't, but it should be time to go home.So Rodrigues also becomes an apostate, after acknowledging that there is no point in trying to spread Catholicism in a swamp country like Japan, deeming it'd be better to live as a seemingly ordinary Japanese while, in complete silence, still be a devout ChristianWell, at least you tried ex-father Rodrigues and you... Hey! Wait a second! That was never the objective! Apostate Rodrigues never set out to get the Japanese to turn!It just hit me! The movie began some way but ended in a completely different one!",Silence
326,notaris818,"Very slow, but with some great moments.",6,7 January 2017,"(No major spoilers)Do not be fooled by the trailer; Silence's 2 minute teaser trailer is full of fast shots, intense music and dramatic acting, but the full 3 hour film is quite the opposite. Silence, Martin Scorsese's latest film, has an immensely slow pace, taking its time with each scene and each shot, almost giving its audience the time to think and ponder, before moving on. The film, based on Endo's 1966 novel, follows a devout Jesuit priest (as played by Andrew Garfield), who is dispatched with his fellow Padre (Driver) to 17th century Japan, where they find inspiration and persecution alike in the search for their fallen master, Father Ferreira (Neeson). Silence is perhaps similar to Inarritu's The Revenant from last year, in its slow pacing and acute intimacy with a tortured, struggling protagonist. However, where The Revenant has stunning landscapes, hauntingly beautiful music and cinematography to match, Silence has no musical score, and is quite minimalist in its directing.Strong performances come from Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver, who show themselves to be versatile and engaging actors. Liam Neeson is particularly noteworthy, seamlessly portraying a converted apostate, but where the film's strength truly lies is in its Japanese actors. Tadanobu Asano and Issei Ogata play their respective samurai with a frightening realism and presence, bringing a mix of affability and danger that is deceptively menacing, while Yosuke Kubozuka delivers a powerful and haunting performance as a persecuted Japanese Christian, Kichijiro, whose faith and morality are constantly tested. What dialogue there is in the film is quite engaging, raising questions about the nature of faith and God that will stay with the audience for some time after finishing the film. Father Rodrigues hears the voice of Jesus – is it God speaking to him, or merely the result of torture and madness?Upon leaving the cinema, a viewer may find themselves feeling relaxed and philosophical, as if they've spent not just 3 hours, but 3 years, in the foggy islands of Japan. However, Silence is by no means for the faint-hearted, with scenes of torture and beheading, realistically and jarringly portrayed. Nor is the film for the quick-hearted, it would seem; in my screening of Silence, four people left after the first hour, presumably tired out by its slow, pondering pace.Overall, Silence is perhaps more meditation than movie.",Silence
327,ddobson-86777,"Could have been a good movie, but they completely screwed it up.",1,26 January 2017,"I saw this movie because I saw Liam Neeson promoting it on TV. Let me just say upfront that if you like Liam Neeson you will be severely disappointed because he is only in the movie for 10 minutes.Anyway, the movie is about Catholicism in Feudal Japan, which needed more exposition in the media to be sure. The Japanese themselves somewhat admitted that Christians got a raw deal in Japan in the Anime Samurai Champloo, and I liked Tom Cruise's The Last Samurai movie as well, though, in retrospect this may have colored my expectations for this film.The plot of the movie involves two priests who go to Japan to investigate claims made by the Japanese that a priest (Liam Neeson) renounced his faith and integrated into Japanese society. The priests meet a Japanese guy in Macau who is to be their guide and later a huge annoyance throughout the rest of the film.The priests arrive in Japan and immediately forget about looking for Liam Neeson's character and start hearing confessions and doing priest stuff for the remaining Japanese Christians they find there. This goes on for almost an hour of the movie until they are inevitably caught by Japanese samurai who do not want Catholicism in their land resulting in the torturous deaths of many Japanese Christians who refuse to step on a picture of Jesus and one of the priests. The samurai sit the remaining priest down and try to explain to him why he shouldn't be spreading unwelcome foreign religions in their land and that if he apostatizes the carnage will stop, but the priest doubles down on his self-righteousness until the remaining Japanese Christians are tortured and Liam Neeson shows up to call the priest out on his self-righteous crusade. This apparently is still not enough, as Jesus also needs to tell the priest to step on his picture. I get that this is supposed to be inspirational for Christians, but the next part would anger and disappoint me if I were still a Christian.After the priest apostatizes, he and Liam Neeson's character are seen helping the samurai catch the remaining Japanese Christians by inspecting their belongings for Christian symbols. Then the movie fast forwards and Liam Neeson's character dies, followed soon after by the younger priest.The movie could have been watchable if they had more Liam Neeson and treated Japanese culture as something other than a curse that you put upon yourself to avoid torture and death.",Silence

330,JoaTomGar,"Is it better to apostatize if it can save lives, or is it better to become a martyr for one's faith?",9,10 February 2020,"The ultimate question in the movie Silence becomes that of the meaning of life: Is life here on earth the most important, or is the ""life"" in heaven/paradise the most important?And the ultimate consequence is then: Is it right to deny one's god (apostatize) if one knows that it can save people from being killed? Or is it right to hold on to one's religion because of the belief that people will enter into paradise even though they will be killed (the belief in martyrdom)?In the movie father Ferreira explains that the Japanese view is that the Church (Christianity) is not desirable as it can never produce anything good (""take root"") in the Japanese society. Ferreira probably means that Christianity produces no life-affirming and strengthening ideology for the life here on earth. Instead the Christian ideology acknowledge death (but Christianity calls it ""life"" in heaven/paradise) and weakness (the Christian concept of sacrifice and self-denial).The Japanese religion (mindset) is more focused on humanity than on divinity according to the film, which means that Christianity's focus on heavenly salvation never works in Japan. In traditional Japanese religion the sun is seen as the god-son that arises every morning to give life to the earth, which makes Christianity's teaching about a god-son who gives his believers life in heaven/paradise incomprehensible.According to father Ferreira, the Japanese Christians have mixed the Christian teachings of God's Son with those of the Japanese religion, and thus do not believe in the same Jesus Christ as Western Christians do. Thus, the ""martyrdom"" of the Japanese Christians becomes unnecessary as they die for a different belief than the ""genuine"" Christianity. Thus, according to Ferreira, it is better to apostatize than to be tormented and killed unnecessarily for a misinterpreted religion.I think that this is the only thing in the movie's theological reasoning that is vague, because how can Ferreira know that all Japanese Christians have misinterpreted the Christian teachings of the god-son? It somehow seems that this is his own excuse to say that the Christian mission in Japan is unnecessary. Or perhaps he says this to justify his own apostasy (and saving his own life). Or perhaps he is right because he has been in Japan for as long as he himself says, and therefore knows what he's talking about.The movie creates a lot of interesting questions about religion and about the meaning of life. The settings are good and the acting is aswell, and if you're interested in history and religion you will like this movie.",Silence

Starting Andrew Garfield, Liam Neeson and Adam Driver it tells the story about the persecution of Japanese Christians in the 18th Century when they were being brutally outlawed for following their faith. Martin's attention to detail and the way of telling the story through Andrew's character that how he was the one having the utmost faith in Christianity and ended up being the one with no faith in his belief.

We've seen so many films like this before - some group of people is being oppressed, and one man; their champion, fruitlessly tries to resist the oppression although his heart is so ever good and kind. I simply do not care for such subjects anymore, and neither do I care for Andrew Garfield's acting. It's like he's trying to look like a model who poses as Jesus in a photoshoot, but also trying out some kinda new trend, where dirt on your face and sad puppy eyes equals more attention from females. It's overacting, it's superficial, and its gross. Be original instead. Scorsese, just because you've made brilliant movies, it doesn't mean you should cover up the real world in dry, fruitless and monotonous narratives which so desperately tries to make an artistic impression.

This will only change the color of your experience, but not the power, because it is not a movie about religion, but about our conscience and about love in a very profound meaning of this word.

One of the lines that made me laugh out loud was, ""these people live so bad lives, how do they do this and still have Jesus in their heart""Really, like the church didn't steal from the poor back then, like everyone is Europe was having a great time in the 1600, like the church didn't kill anyone that went against it's teachings, like they didn't subdue science because it was against it, like the pope wasn't busy starting wars and enriching their own family.Anyway back to the film, the first hour is basically 2 guys going to one village, causing trouble and getting the local arrested and killed because they're Christians and the local gets tortured and killed, then they move to the next village and do the same, but we're not meant to feel sorry for the locals because they have Jesus in their hearts, we're meant to feel sorry for the 2 white guys who have to watch it.

340,danielgj-85299,Great film that runs too long,9,31 December 2016,"Silence is amazing. Martin Scorsese has proved to be the most consistent filmmaker of all time with a great body of work for each decade he's made movies. Here he continues to be as versatile and impressive as ever. Just by looking at the past two movies he has made, Silence and The Wolf of Wall Street, you can see this man has no bounds. He's probably the only filmmaker who's quality hasn't gone down over time, and this film proves it.Although this movie is great, its not perfect. Now, this might seem to contradict everything I just wrote, but you will feel the pain all the Christians in this movie felt by siting through it. By that I mean, you'll need some serious stamina to get through the movie, it's extremely long and at times can be very boring. Its almost like Scorsese was trying to torture us so we can relate to the people on screen. Some parts feel a little repetitive too, especially after the two leads split up. The beginning drags on a little too much and so does the end. The movie didn't seem to know when to end, after the protagonist makes his final-ish decision in the movie, the movie should have been over just a bit after, but instead it kept going. I also feel people who aren't a part of a faith or really familiar with it might not enjoy some of the religious rituals depicted early on, honestly I'm religious and found a lot of those parts boring. I also didn't like that we had a disembodied God voice or the ending ""reveal"", its just a tool to spoon feed the message to the audience and completely unnecessary, taking us away from reality and taking away from Rodregues' struggle. The ending ""reveal"" was especially pointless telling us something we didn't need to be told and would have been better if the film let us doubt a bit. Despite the not-so-goodness I just talked about, this movie stuck with me in a good way. This is one of the few movies where as I thought about it more after watching it, I liked it more rather than less. It's just so rich in meaning, everything about it, the decisions each character makes, from the villagers, the three priests, and the villains of the story. Looking at the Christian villagers and the three priests, everyone makes an important decision that is perfectly fleshed out. the motives and consequences of their actions are thought provoking, but I don't want to spoil anything so I'll move on. This is also one of those movies where the title is a beautiful representation of the film. The idea of silence being both the struggle and answer to those of faith is done perfectly (and kind of ruined when they give God a few lines, but I guess I'll let that slide). Looking away from the message and at the film itself, there are some scenes in this movie that are extremely tense that kept me hooked, of course there are also some less tense dragged out scenes, but when stuff happens and the plot moves it gets interesting and its too well done to ignore. The entire cast in this movie is great. Liam Neeson isn't in much of this film, but when he is the subtlety of his performance is outstanding. Specifically, his interaction with Andrew Garfield are well done, the awkwardness and genuineness of it is great. Andrew Garfield once again takes the role of a religious man who has his faith tested, pride pushed, and is hunted by the Japanese in Japan. In all honesty, The characters and the films are very different, but this and Hacksaw Ridge are two home runs for Andrew Garfield as he is excellent in both roles, probably more so in this one because of the lack of his creepy smile. Adam Driver, Tadanobu Asano, Yôsuke Kubozuka and the rest of the supporting cast were also excellent and I would have liked to see more of Adam Driver in this because his character didn't have that much of an arch. Overall loved it, it might be too long and religious for some, but I think you should be able to look past that and really see the deep meaning and excellent filmmaking at work.",Silence

What I saw was well-done, but I kept asking myself ""What was the point of all this?"" The film was hugely supportive of missionising, but was the Jesuit missionising in 17C Japan a good thing? The Japanese government had a policy of keeping out all foreigners, including missionaries, but they had good reasons for doing this. As had been seen in the Americas, and was being seen in China, missionaries came hand-in-hand with commercial interests, backed up by the military. It usually didn't end well for the local people, who were usually colonised and often enslaved.Yes, the methods used by the Japanese government were cruel, but were no crueller than what Christians were doing to each other at the time. The Thirty Years War between Catholics and Protestants was an ongoing bloodbath.The missionaries were excellent marketers, skilled in the double-whammy approach - first sell 'em Sin, then sell 'em Salvation, the missionaries being the indispensable middle-men. So thousands of Japanese died because they swallowed the missionaries' self-serving mumbo-jumbo.I had hoped that the film would be more nuanced, exploring the rights and wrongs of missionising. Instead Scorcese chooses to do a propaganda piece - glorifying brave, noble missionaries against the cruel Japanese government.Not a great film.",Silence

It is incredible how you create an adaption of ""Chinmoku"" with a happy ending. The movie is not about that.

I know that US and UK viewers do not like subtitles and are not used to them, and there would be no space for Liam Nielsen or Andrew Garfield, but it really affects the movie in my opinion.

It's about a couple of well-off dudes wreaking havoc on a bunch of credulous farmers.

I enjoyed it, it's worth your money, it is worth of Scorsese's legacy, acting is top notch, and the pacing felt right to me, but the story itself falls apart at times and the movie has to fall back to characters to carry the narrative further.Honestly, watch it.

It just makes you wonder about various aspects of Christianity, religion itself, human nature and traits of respect for others. The surroundings and the scenery of the picture are breath-taking and wonderful. It really helps to feel the emotions that Scorsese wanted to set.

Unfortunately this is not a surprise from Hollywood but it is disappointing to see Scorsese be so attracted to such a lopsided story.Two Portuguese priests travel to a 17th century Japan, where Christianity is outlawed, to find another priest there who is missing and might have recanted his faith. The script focuses on Padre Rodrigues. Everything profound is saved for his Japanese captors while he is left with little to say in reply other than that which could be written by any layman amateur author. It's embarrassing. It's just a relentless verbal beating of this padre and his inability to effectively refute anything. From the opening scenes I knew this would happen. They were doomed from the start to never make a point. I wish I was wrong. It would have been a better movie if I had been.The poor abused peasants are seen as ignorant and naive while their brutal overlords are wise, with their best interests at heart(despite the frequent murder, execution, and torture...). Never is the motive of the government questioned, at least verbally. It's hard to think of a less challenging and dynamic story recently, and that's saying something. I suppose I could forgivingly recognize the unanswered faith of the Christians as the tragedy of the message, but honestly, I think the philosophical lashing the authorities heap on Rodriguez is what the writer really wants to get across.Visually there's not much to offer except competence which would otherwise be good enough save for the predictable but disappointing script.Completely unnecessary narration pops up from time to time usually telling us what we can already see on screen. Ironic for a movie called ""Silence"" to feel the need to spoon feed the audience with redundant exposition that really adds very little to the movie other than interruption.While the two priests don't offer much to the viewer, and the Japanese authority plays the same pious note, unchallenged, throughout(save for some ineffectual token rebuttal), there is one intriguing character by the name of Kichijiro, played wonderfully by Yosuke Kubozuka. Friend of the priests, he is a Japanese Christian, but a coward, endlessly failing spiritual tests and begging forgiveness afterwards, all the while keeping faith, even till the end. Hands down he stole the show, leaving me with at least one character to enjoy.I understand the author of the the book, from which this movie is based, intended to depict the futility and ignorance of Christian missionary work in Japan, and apparently Scorsese was fascinated by this too. But all we get is a message and plot that never challenges itself and does nothing but relentlessly handicaps one side. This movie is like watching a tennis match with player A playing and player B standing there doing nothing. It simply doesn't make for a good story. I wish Martin Scorsese, and Hollywood in general would, rather beat down player B, take a chance on an actual game.",Silence
349,AlpenglowMemories,"A film of passion, faith and betrayal",8,25 January 2017,"A long awaited passion project of Martin Scorsese's, SILENCE is a film that stays truthful to its title. One of the most immediately recognisable traits of the film is its complete lack of score. Silence is not elevated by themes and motifs, by recurring orchestral identities for the major developments of the film's soul, instead it is surrounded by the noise of birds, wind, waves and language. Silence moves at a moderate pace as it tracks the trials and tribulations its characters face as they enter Japan searching for their missing teacher, hoping to disprove the rumours of his alleged relinquishing of his Catholicism. Both Garfield and Driver do well in their roles. Garfield's Rodriguez is the centre of the film. But he and Driver's Garrpe play in an interesting way: Garrpe appears almost as a more refined, superior version of Rodriguez; he is more faithful to his convictions, less lenient with dismissals of the faith - and he does not trust the drunk Kitchijiro so easily. An important disagreement foreshadows their fates. Kitchijiro serves as the Judas-like character, possibly a reflection of Rodriguez's own hubris. He is a weak man, desperate and willing to toss away his religious convictions in favour of survival. An illuminating moment between him and the protagonist asks questions of the 'faithful servant of God' - in a simpler time, of much lesser sacrifices, Kitchijiro would have made a much more faithful Christian. Silence's screen time is focuses greatly on difficult and powerful scenes of torture - often psychological it focuses on the breaking of spirits rather than gory excess. The Japanese seek to rid their country of the catholic faith - the High Inquisitor describes it as having no place to grow in Japan. Is Japan inhospitable of its own nature and culture, or have these powerful patriarchs poisoned the soil to stop its growth?Silence, stylistically, has many classic Scorsese elements, yet sees the film-maker more restrained than usual. Silence is a quieter film. Yet he shows off his remarkable technical ability in crane shots, tracking shots, powerful uses of fog and mist and darkness; and even extended point-of-view shots capturing the action. The period detail is beautiful and Silence has many striking images - some may, in a way, remind the viewer of Akira Kurosawa, though Scorsese always retains his distinctive mark. Silence may not be Scorsese's best film, but it is an impressive, moving, gripping and stimulating one. A worthy addition to his filmography.",Silence

351,monty_100,An educational and emotional film,10,8 September 2017,"Martin Scorcese has created a masterpiece here. Not only this, the messages put to the viewer about strength of faith and staying true to what a person believes in make this a fantastic piece of film.The film stars Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield, two Jesuit priests that have received word of their mentor (Liam Neeson) surrendering the faith of Christianity. They make it their mission to travel to Japan to find him and discover the truth. On arrival, their faith, along with the Japanese Christians they find in hiding, is tested to the highest of limits, as the Japanese government forbid any religion to be practiced other than their own. First of all, the performances are fantastic. You are sent on a journey with Andrew's character and, whether you are religious or not, can feel the pain he suffers. I believe that even if you are not familiar with the full historical context, emotions can be felt here. Andrew Garfield especially in this moment in time is definitely one to watch right now.Secondly, It looks absolutely gorgeous! Despite the fact that it was not filmed in Japan (it was filmed in Taiwan), doesn't detract from its natural beauty. I never once thought ""Hey, they don't look like Japanese mountains!"". The gorgeous landscape shots and close up shots result in beautiful cinematography from start to finish.The audience is sent through emotional carnage. It never lets you off the hook for a second, and just as you think it couldn't get any worse for the protagonists, it does. It is a long film (some may say too long) and very emotionally draining, but connections can be made to the endurance both we go through as an audience and the characters in the film. Even though this film is based heavily on religion, which could potentially steer away a lot of viewers, I believe any one can watch it. This is more of a film based on life itself, and staying true to what you a believe in no matter the costs or setbacks. That has potential to resonate with a very large audience. I don't normally stay behind for credits, but for once I needed to just so i could process everything I had seen. There is a lot to take in here. Its an incredibly complex film that will get you thinking, and with films like The Emoji Movie right now, whats the harm in a little thinking?",Silence

353,TheOmnislash,Another masterpiece by Martin Scorsese,9,19 September 2017,"In 1988 the film directed by Martin Scorsese, titled The last temptation of Christ, was known as a quite scandalous movie due to the outrage among Christian communities. Almost thirty years have passed since then and Martin Scorsese made another religion-related film which focuses on faith as well. A Japanese novel called Silence was written by Shusaku Endo in 1969 and has the same title as the adaption. Silence was nominated for one Oscar and was first released in the Vatican. The film is set in the seventeenth century in Japan where two Jesuit priests are attempting to find their mentor who is rumored to have committed apostasy. The mission however is quite dangerous since Japanese inquisitors are looking for Christians to slaughter or to force them to refuse their faith. Rodrigues, one of the two priests is the main character portrayed by Andrew Garfield (Hacksaw Ridge, 99 homes). Although Martin Scorsese has already received probably the best awards that a director can be awarded, he is still able to astonish people. The main questions are quite extraneous for people in the twenty-first century: where is the line between the practice of the faith and idolatry? Is there someone listening to the prayers? Is our conviction more important than rationality? These questions are old-fashioned and long-ago forgotten ones however they perfectly reflect on an age when morality and conviction were important, whilst these values are not precious nowadays. Andrew Garfield(Father Rodrigues) is overwhelmingly authentic and amazing as a loyal believer who has to go through hard physical and mental trials such as not betraying the Lord or being closed away from civilization for long weeks. Moreover, he needs to deal with these circumstances without hearing any answers from his God. This grinding silence is torturing him until he starts to doubt. He compares his passion to the passion of Jesus as he becomes the prisoner of a well-known inquisitor and believes the only way of escaping is martyrdom. The most interesting scene is the meeting with Father Ferreira(Liam Neeson) when he gets the answers and recognizes the fact that he had been seeking them the wrong way. The main reason what makes this film amazing is the remarkable acting and the great dialogues. Cinematography and sound editing are also remarkable components of this great masterpiece. I would recommend this movie for those who appreciate slowly evolving films and for those who like Martin Scorsese's movies.",Silence

The audio engineers really stuck out in a bad way, with VERY noticeable differences between in field audio and dubbed voices. Heck, they couldn't even match the volumes from word to word! Usually these differences are only noticeable when using headphones, but in this movie they were so poorly done you could hear them through a cheap speaker setup. The fact that they were able to attract A list actors is shocking!I think this is a terrible movie that will go down in history as a forgotten terrible movie.

Even in the most powerful of scenes, the ones where you'd expect some intensity, there is still silence. There are scenes where you want to scream and you can't. You 're getting lost in the atmosphere, the incapability of taking action and you don't scream because you feel you can't or you shouldn't.I find this brilliant. The movie makes you fell exactly like the characters most of the time. You can't fully understand the meaning until the end. And maybe not even after that. But I believe the meaning is on some level subjective. I still have mixed thoughts and feelings about it. I can't decide if it is liberating, hopeful or pessimistic. Maybe it's all three somehow.But I understood this. You can't expect some sign of truth from God, if you believe in one. It is you, it is us, humans, alone in this world and our faith is all we' re gonna have. The movie shows the Japanese believing in Christianity, wanting to go to ""Paraiso"" (paradise), but it leaves doubts about whether they truly understood what they believed in. Did they truly believe in Jesus Christ and God, did they really understand the meaning of Christianity or did they die just to go to paradise, to escape from suffering, or worse, did they die just because the interpreter wanted to make the priest deny his faith? That is what makes the protagonist eventually do what he did. He fought with God's silence over and over again. He fought, he doubted, until he understood that he had to embrace it. Truth or not, he knew what was the right thing to do. Accept God's silence and try to speak for him. Eventually hear Him speak through His silence. Feeling his presence beside him. Feeling he's not alone. Never letting go of his faith. Never letting go of himself. In the end, he didn't care if he was praying to silence. In the end, silence was liberating for him. It was all he ever knew. In the end, it was not silence. It was the answer.",Silence

364,jm-50799,An admirable and realistic portrayal of Christianity,9,22 April 2020,"I personally never came from a strong ideological background and religion was never a presence in during my upbringing. Due to this, I have always found it extremely difficult to fathom what one's consciousness would be like when possessed so strongly from an ideology such as religion. As I became more aware of the negative consequences of such ideological possessions in the modern world, I was always thankful that religion didn't rule my consciousness and have the cataclysmic effect it was causing around the world within my own community. Nevertheless, in the face of this indifference to religion, Martin Scorsese Silence is a true work of empathy that potently captures the transcending power of the belief of Christianity while also acknowledging the fundamental paradoxes that appear when the moral logic of Christianity is applied to the harshness of reality. Whether you're religious or the most extreme atheist, I doubt that any viewer is going to walk away from Silence without truly being in admiration of the human spirit and its ability to transcend the fear of morality when backend by an ideology. Of course, there are issues with this notion (which will be discussed later) as it is a catalyst for causing some of the most significant issues associated with religion in the 21st century, but the most refreshing aspect about Silence is that Scorsese acknowledges both the positive and negative impacts of such a belief. In essence, Silence is one of the few films that treats religion in a realistic and applicable manner.Scorsese's period piece is set in the 17th century and focuses on two priests (played by Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver) that travel to Japan to save their mentor (who has apparently committed apostasy) and to promote the teachings of Christianity in a country where Christians are being slaughtered due to their belief. Eventually, when the two priests meet the Japanese villagers where Christianity is a presence, Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) is amazed at the level of belief that is shown in these communities.As Rodrigues awe of the village dwellers grows, it's virtually impossible to not garner a sense of respect for the commitment shown by these individuals. Even in the face of death and torture (which Scorsese presents with his typical, visceral brutality), these believers never renounced their faith, despite knowing the brutal consequences. In one of the most powerful scenes of the entire film, a group of villagers are mounted to wooden-crosses located on the edge of a cliff-face where they must wait as the tide slowly rises, subsequently ensuring that they endure a slow and painful death from drowning. Rodrigues watches on, astonished by the fact that despite being surrounded by their impending mortality, the torture victims never renounce their fate, even if renouncing ensures their freedom. These particular scenes must have been emotional for Scorsese, who could of well and truly looked upon these characters as quintessential embodiments of true believers. Even in the face of the strongest human emotion (fear), they never renounced their belief in God. In many ways, these scenes serve as a powerful reminder of the capability of the human spirit, both physically and mentally.Obviously, from a 21st perspective or simply from someone who discredits the notion of believing in a higher deity, these scenes may seem ridiculous and highlight some of the apparent problems associated with religion. The most obvious being that when possessed by such an ideology, a person is satisfied to sacrifice their own life knowing that if they didn't renounce their faith, this ensures they will be promised a more idealistic life in paradise. If viewing the film from this 21st century perspective, then viewers will most likely scoff at these decisions made by the characters. Why on earth would someone not renounce their faith - a faith that is completely fictional - to ensure their own freedom? But of course, this perspective is not fair to the historical context. All these events took place well before the advancements of the enlightenment period and the theories that began to challenge religious belief were not yet present. If the viewer can conjure the empathetic skills to understand that during this context, religion was held in the highest esteem and considered completely factual, then to witness the sheer commitment of these Japanese peasants is not stupid, but rather incredibly admirable.This may seem that Scorsese is only portraying religion with a sense of admirability; however, this doesn't mean that the director isn't willing to acknowledge the fundamental flaws that appear when the moral logic of Christianity is applied to reality. These issues are perfectly illustrated when Rodrigues is confronted with the most apparent paradox of his belief: if God exists, how can he possibly let so many innocent people die and let sin prevail? This question serves as the main dramatic tension for the central character and as the question persists, Rodrigues continually looks for a sign from God that reaffirms his faith. Unfortunately, the only sound from the universe is an echo of defiant silence. In the director's typical fashion, Scorsese conveys these existential issues through imagery that is viscerally brutal and conscious ingraining. In one particular sequence, Rodrigues believes that God has intervened to save the life of an innocent peasant. As he repays God's intervention with a thankful prayer, the innocent peasant is brutally decapitated, which sends Rodrigues into another existential crisis. The nature of such sequences serve as a potent reminder of how the moral logic of religion ultimately fails when applied to the harshness of reality.This silence is the main method that the Japanese Buddhist exploit to eradicate Rodrigues belief in Christianity. The theory being that if they can force a Priest to apostasize, the Japanese peasants will follow suit. Basically, the Buddhist give Rodrigues an ultimatum: renounce your faith and the innocent will live or continue your belief while the innocent are brutally murdered. As you can imagine, this creates an extremely difficult catch-22 for Rodrigues as he torn between the two positions. He could renounce his faith and the let the innocent live but this creates a paradox that is almost impossible to reconcile because if he takes this position, it would simultaneously align with and subvert Rodrigues belief in Christianity. Obviously, protecting the innocent is a fundamental principle of Christianity and the renouncement of one's faith is an obvious subversion. Thus, the decision that is made is both a continuation and subversion of the Christian doctrine. In similar fashion, the other choice creates the exact same paradoxical situation. Due to this, it's impossible not to sympathize with Rodrigues' plight as any decision will ensure a tragic outcome, both physically and mentally. As we watch how Rodrigues is grinded through the various torture mechanism, we are in utter sympathy for a man who is attempting to withstand the breakdown of his essential belief system.Unfortunately, there's only so much torture an individual can withstand and the Buddhist eventually get their desired outcome as Rodrigues renounces his faith. Simply put, to watch a priest that has placed the quintessential meaning of his life on a concept that he is forced to reject is heartbreaking. Even if you're not from a religious background and cannot understand the significance of such a moment, you should still be able to sympathize with the feeling of an existential crisis. The horrifying point in time when you stare out to the universe, just after the moment where your own subjective principles that have been governing your life suddenly signify nothing, and reality seems utterly meaningless. Regardless of your ideological background, Scorsese conveys Rodrigues tragedy with a level of power that demands our sympathy.In spite of this bleakness, Scorsese ends Silence on a powerfully symbolic shot that suggests that despite the transgressions of Rodrigues, his faith is still present. The beauty of this final shot is not only from the rare glimpse of optimism that is provided but rather from the kind-hearted, and frankly more realistic, portrayal of God. A portrayal that insinuates that even if we think we have committed the most abysmal transgression in the eyes of God such as the apostasy, He will still accept us. These conclusive passages must have been highly personal for Scorsese, a man who has openly admitted the moments in his own life where he has strayed from the path of God and committed sin. However, just like Rodrigues, Scorsese returned to his belief despite his own moral shortcomings.",Silence

Not so much in the film making, but in the story. The priests and the christians are portrayed as the wronged party, the victims of an unjust persecution. However, let's not forget what would have happened if the Japanese had allowed Christianity in their society. The church would have found a stronghold and persecuted and murdered everyone not of their faith as they have done for centuries in the rest of the world. The Japanese knew this and acted upon it. I am not saying that it was the right thing to do, but they were given the same treatment as they would have given vice versa.Now, let me clarify, I have nothing against Christianity, but I have something against religions who won't allow a human being to believe what they want to believe. Everyone should have the right to and no one should be punished, looked down upon or persecuted for it.And that basically includes almost all religions now and then, I am sad to say.Why can't we all just get along and leave each other be.

Because Christ is exalted above human control they see it as a threat so they kill the freedom of Christ. In the end they fear relinquishing their power to God.

370,jaredmarshall-1,book lovers dreaming of what could have been...,6,3 January 2017,"Having read the book I was full of anticipation for this movie for years. I had high hopes that Scorsese could bring the story to the big screen in his own way- creating a soaring epic with the Scorsese touch shown time and time again.However, what we are left with is a trudging story with wasted characters and unwarranted comedy in patches. Kichijiro is a tormented soul in the book and his behaviour of repeatedly asking for forgiveness is pathetic yet we pity him. It played out in the theatre like he was a comedy cameo, with the audience even sighing on his final appearance.The original casting of Del Toro, Day-Lewis and Gael Garcia Bernal had me salivating as the prospect of this story. However seeing the direction Scorsese took with this film I am glad the cast changed. Parts of the movie felt like I was watching a bad audio book come to life, audiences are getting wiser and I see no need in having to make everything black and white. Where is the ambiguity I yearn for? I admit that there is a bit of that towards the end and we can conclude our own opinions about the faith of our leading characters and why they make the decisions they make. But this left me wanting so much more! Adam Driver was good as Garpe, but underused and his death scene on the beach was a wasted opportunity for real beauty and tragedy. The extras were pulling ridiculous faces of menace that distracted from Garfield's attempts to draw us in and give us true emotion. He did a fine job, but those around him did him no favours. In the book his head 'bobbing up and down in the water, drifting further and further away' stung my heart. Here I wanted Garfield to be alone on his knees watching his friend floating in the distance. The way Garpe died was very confusing and even if it is the case with the book the movie could have tidied it up a bit and chose not to.Liam Neeson was a fine Ferrara, but again was left to struggle with a labouring script and lack of depth. An interesting moment when he examined a shipped product and declared it 'non Christian' just for Rodrigues to discover it was a Christian product moments later. Was he revealing his regret in this moment? trying to salvage his faith and sneak Christianity into Japan? Even after his speeches to Rodrigues about Japan never being changed? Whatever it was... didn't really fit the moment. A strange attempt to add some subtext to Ferrara.Some of the editing was really poor, it was clear to me in several places they had placed audio over the top when characters mouths weren't moving. It happened several times with Garfield and I saw no sense in it, again Scorsese patronising the audience and adding more than is needed to paint a picture with what is happening on screen.The torture scenes were mild, I was really looking forward to 'the pit'. I was left throughout thinking about 'The Passion of the Christ', I didn't expect it to be as brutal but I think Scorsese could have stretched the boundaries a little more here but maybe it would have meant an R (18+) rating rather than his very conservative 15 rating. Maybe it's a financial decision. Who cares.Finally, the saving grace, Issei Ogata as the Inquisitor. A concrete performance full of life. He was funny, daring, intimidating and real. I think we could have seen more of him and maybe- just maybe- if the film focused more on the calculated manipulation of the Inquisitor, turning and twisting Rodrigues as he had to Ferrara, it could have been real battle of good vs evil. Ultimately, Silence is a grand film with excellent shots and a good heart but it's pace and story leave us feeling nothing for our central characters. I left the theatre in silence.

371,philip_franklin2000,stunned into silence,3,11 January 2017,"20 years in the making (apparently) and yet the most stark silence was that of the audience after the movie who clearly and with understandable deference to the Scorsese canon, were unwilling to immediately call this movie out for the self-indulgent disaster it actually is and could find few words to compensate for the searing boredom most had undoubtedly endured. Perhaps it's art masquerading as entertainment but, for me, it fails as either. The story was sparse, the characters undeveloped, the cinematography sometimes lush and promising and often the best thing about the movie. The message? There was little here that gave me anything to chew on. Faith is a tough gig at any time but particularly on a clandestine crusade in 17th century Japan? Sure. When life is almost unbearably awful the promise of paradise in the afterlife is alluring? Uh-huh. Belief is riddled with ambiguity, uncertainty, fear and doubt. Yep, I get it. If we were meant to sympathise or even empathise with a mission to convert the peasant classes in isolated and xenophobic Japan then I failed, badly. When God spoke in the silence I got confused, more worryingly so did the Jesuit priest. What was the question Scorsese was struggling so obviously to answer?

It's a very beautiful movie, it explores various topics that would be rather not known to the viewer. Andrew Garfield just performs so well in his role and brings out the character in perfect light. I really don't understand many of the viewers expectations from this movie. It is just perfect in it's own way, I don't think this could have been executed any better.

Its hard to believe in something who's not hear you, who's seems to not care about you. Andrew Garfield plays that young miserable person who don't know how to face his believe in order to his suffering, and he tries to live with those contradictions as much as he can.

Sure the scenery and some footage gives it the idea of a ""powerful"" film, but that illusion quickly faded for me. The script was indeed overly narrational and pathetically simple. The depiction of the Japanese as a bunch of belligerent heathens or sociopathic Buddhists was offensive. I'll admit that the trailer sold me that this could be a great movie and I was convinced this movie could be at least half as entertaining and mesmerizing as The Mission (1986), but I am so proud of having walked out of that movie.",Silence

377,tripartnji,Interesting historical narrative/ a bit repetitive,7,25 July 2019,So a lot of the reviews on here are clearly taking the religious context of this film to the extreme calling it a Christian propaganda film to demonize Japanese history or Buddhism as a whole but I genuinely don't believe Martin Scorsese had that as an agenda nor would he put his talent to channel that kind of negativity. This movie is based on a book so the story tells of two Portuguese Catholic priests who are at first going on a mission to japan to see if there father mentor truly apostatized their faith. When they end up getting to Japan they find Japanese Christians who have to hide their beliefs due to the severe punishment enforced by the Japanese government at the time. Although the main character shows his will power in trying to uphold his Christian teachings and quest to save the local villages restored faith in Christianity the story is not supposed to tell the audience to be a Christian or show a weepy story about the suffering Christians have endured through out times of persecution. To me it's merely showing a historical account of what was happening throughout Japan at this time in the 17th century and really makes you think about the psychology of man and how much the main character will endure before ending the suffering of others or himself for a God who won't answer him back in his prayers and pleads. I will say the movie could be much shorter but I can see why it was drug on in some regards. The repetitive torture scenes or raids on villages do get a bit dry but are trying to emphasize a point at the same time. Very little scoring as far as music is concerned and the audio mixing was strange in some of the dialogue (minor inconvenience but stuck out in some scenes). Overall the last 25-30 minutes really make you think about what the films central message is and shows an interesting historical narrative. Was the main character too caught up in his faith to sacrifice the church's doctrines or were his choices trying to replicate the image of Christ's biblical story in a Strange ego driven craze. All adds to a great story and for the record I have no religious bias in this review to all the trolls claiming this movie is religiously motivated by the director,Silence
378,sean-711-812470,Powerful Kurosawa homage by the great Martin Scorsese,10,15 December 2016,"Saw an advance screening: This is a powerful film, incredibly challenging and well-acted. Amazing location footage, historical details from 17th century Japan, and depiction of a clash of cultures between East and West. Scorsese is clearly doing a Kurosawa homage here, as the film has an old-fashioned epic feeling to it. As for the plot based on Shusako Endo's historical novel, it's remarkably even-handed. At the time of the isolationist Tokugawa shogunate, which only ended in 1867 after American gunboats forced Japan's ports to reopen to trade, the Japanese clearly saw the Catholic faith as symbolic of Western cultural and political takeover. But does that justify the torture, coercion, and killing of Christians to make them abandon their faith? We might consider a historical analogy: When the Spanish later felt the same way, driving the Moors out of Spain and forcing those who remained to convert to Catholicism because of the perception that Islam symbolized cultural and political takeover, do we excuse the Spanish Inquisition? The best answer might be that we can understand even if we do not excuse violent push-backs against invading cultures. There is perhaps an allegory here, as well, to the current plight of Syrian refugees and their reception or non-reception by European nations. In any event, the themes here are rich and complex, and the cast -- particularly Garfield, Neeson, Driver, and the masterful Japanese actor who plays the inquisitor -- are outstanding. This is Scorsese at his finest, eschewing black-and-white thinking in favor of complex moral dilemmas. I don't think I've ever seen a mainstream Hollywood film that is as intelligent about addressing cross-cultural and inter-religious dialogue as ""Silence."" The anguish of religious faith is part of what's going on here, but it's only the centerpiece of a very rich cinematic canvas.",Silence
379,chip-726-410993,A Masterwork of Restraint,9,30 January 2017,"Martin Scorsese's ""Silence"" is not entertainment. It offers neither thrill, nor escapism, nor joy. It is not education in that It does not aim to convey facts or impart knowledge. It is not as didactic as a homily, or as quizzical as a kōan. I imagine it is best described simply as art. That seems an apt label, since the exercise of watching ""Silence"" resembled to me the ponderous study of a painting in a museum. A painted masterpiece does not merely depict the beauty of its subject, but conveys also some aspect of truth. The nature of this truth is imbued partly by the master, and reflected partly from the observer who explores it. The Mona Lisa does not force you to understand why she smirks, nor does she demand that you respond in kind. Yet each man appreciates her differently, and each in his own way gleans a bit of her truth viewed through the lens of his own. Such is the nature and quality of ""Silence"".This is a sober, challenging film in every respect. The heady subjects of faith and doubt in the apparent absence of absolution are explored with an unflinching honesty. Scorsese refrains from tugging at heartstrings or welling up emotional responses through music. He refuses to tell the audience what to think, preferring instead to simply depict a story worth thinking about. The lack of emotional manipulation is stunning, almost unsettling. It is a masterwork of restraint in a milieu typified by pretension and hyperbole.",Silence

381,iam-omshanti,The master makes a masterful film!,8,3 August 2017,"This is not a film for everyone: it's a slow-paced film with no obvious special effects; a thinking person's film - about religion and what it means to have faith even at the cost of your life, especially of the Christian kind versus following the Buddha's path in 15th century Japan. A film about real characters who once existed, therefore a story based on facts, and history is always well worth reviewing lest we repeat the mistakes of our forefathers.Having been brought up by an atheist father, who married a non-practising Buddhist Japanese (2nd wife, my step-mother), yet having gone to church for 4 yrs at high school at my English boarding school in the UK in the 70s, and later finding much to resonate within Buddhism in my 30s (I was to become an ardent student for 18 yrs), I found this film of particular interest.It makes for harrowing viewing when the authorities, bent on enforcing their intolerance of all things Western, including the practice of Christianity, repeatedly route out Japanese Christians from villages - with vigour! Poor peasants with a childlike faith. It's painful to watch them suffer so much! For what? Holding onto an image of a saviour and paradise beyond death, after enduring a difficult life under dominating landlords and regional governors!A long film at almost 3 hrs, but whilst some viewers found that overly long, I did not.

Some of the sequences could have been edited and thus shorten the film. The exchanges between the clergyman and the inquisitor –among the best features of the film for thoughtful viewers– could have been more frequent and revealing of the Asian / European divide when it comes to fathoming the role of faith in these two Portugal and Japan homogenous yet strikingly different ethnic, cultural, and religious societies. The performances while very believable are of characters who become too stereotypical given the numerous scenes of brutality displayed, as well as hinted at, in the course of the narrative. Among the best themes revealed in the dialog is the absence of divine intervention and the possible reasons for all that fear, torment, & suffering to which audiences are subjected by the scenes of torture and sacrifice. A clear, well-written script, delivered by very capable actors, accompanies beautifully photographed scenes. The story line does lack sufficient details to fully reveal the causes of what we witness in the film, unless of course Scorcese deliberately wanted us (like Job) to fully appreciate the senselessness of authoritarian extremism as much as he does the absence of divine grace.

So... I think it is fair to say that it is quite long.Now, was it worth three hours? I say yes... the story of Christian persecution is real, it's big, and just as Father Rodrigues says in one scene, quoting Tertulian, ""the blood of martyrs is the seed of the church."" People who oppose the Christian faith will most probably not like it, for the entire story is told from the perspective of Padre Rodrigues. It is undeniable - this movie will fuel the faith of Christians.Andrew Garfield, in my opinion, did a great job here. I believed every single cry. The editors also did a great job here. There were just very few moments in which the visuals didn't feel real, and they were not essential to the story. Like when his mentor points to the sun, and the movie shows the sun. That felt weird.

400,iqbal-65091,Reveals The Contradictory And Paradoxical Nature Of Humanity,10,28 June 2021,"""I feel so tempted to feel despair. I'm afraid. The weight of your silence is terrible. I pray, but I'm lost. Or am I just praying to nothing. Because you are not there."" - Father Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield)This is a movie about faith and religion. Both the power of faith and also its dangers. It reveals faith's hypocrisies but also its beauties. There are multiple occasions where the two priests are given the chance to save people by just renouncing their faith but they chose not to and people die as a result. People are die because they do not want to sacrifice their faith. On the other hand, the Inquisitor, tells the priests that the killings are all their faults since they would not renounce their faith even though it is on the Inquisitor's command that all these people are being killed. You can see faults and logic from both sides and that's what's so amazing about this film. It doesn't try to give you an answer. It just poses questions and leaves the answering to you.The acting in this film is also phenomenal, from what I heard, Andrew Garfield lost 40 lbs and Adam Driver lost 50 lbs for their roles. There was one scene that really sticks out for me. It was the one where Father Garrpe (Adam Driver) dives into the ocean to try and rescue four strangers who were being drowned because he wouldn't step on an image of Christ. The way he screams for them to take him instead is horrifying. But Andrew Garfield in that scene truly shines. He is held back by at least a dozen people while he watches his fellow priest being drowned along with four other Christians as he begs and screams for their lives. This was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever scene. My jaw was on the ground the entire time.By the way, this movie has no music. It does use nature sounds in the background but there are no instrumental music. I think it really brings out the rawness of what occurs on screen.The film is also 2 hours and 41 minutes which is pretty long but it did not feel long to me. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time and it left me very thought provoked which was defiantly Scorsese's aim.Scorsese wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times where he discussed why he does not personally like Marvel and franchise movies in general. To him, these types of movies aren't cinema. To Scorsese, ""cinema was about revelation - aesthetic emotional and spiritual revelation. It was about their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves."" This statement, I think, perfectly encapsulates what Scorsese was trying to illustrate about the human condition in this film. I also think the fact that this film tanked in the box office with only $26 million with a budget of $50 million also goes to prove Scorsese point that -his definition of- cinema is a dying art from.",Silence

Adam Driver was a fantastic support as well as Neeson's cameo as the original fallen priest. The acting throughout was intense and a special mention to the Japanese actors/actresses who really did add depth to the world around. The overall setting and wardrobe made the film immersive and rich in detail.The script and story wasn't what I was expecting at all. If you do happen to be Christian and felt offended, I'd rewatch and look at the subtleties with more scrutiny. I think the overall idea was not to make the Christian missionaries look bigoted or righteous, but more to show a wider reality that could apply anywhere. Outsiders are not often welcome, especially when they bring a doctrine that contradicts the cultural norms and values.Brutal, gritty, and very well directed.

405,emanuel-delia,Where is God?,9,10 January 2017,"An artist's identity may look complex at first, but on deeper analysis a lifetime's work betrays distilled and inescapable pillars. Scorsese's Italian, Catholic, East Coast identities hide behind no subtleties. A pillar of identity does not determine one's belief system or political views. It does not control actions, opinions or decisions. It is an essence that outstays an individual's will and persists in spite of conscious choices.There are atheists, and then there are lapsed Catholics. I am of the latter sort and though I have not professed any form of faith for three-fourths of my life, the dogmas of that first fourth condition my anguish.The harrowing silence of God: His failure to answer prayers, no matter how fervent; the inescapable injustice of existence; the transparent deception that reward for suffering and iniquity is only given in the beyond from whence no one can give witness to the benevolence of the divine.This violent emptiness is an exquisite shudder down the back of those who pray and those who have long since stopped praying.And cinema, made of sounds and of images, of reflections and actions, of experience and supposition, has on occasion paused to listen to God's silence.The returning crusading knight in Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957) heaved in exalted frustration at God's apparent indifference to the Black Death. Jehanne the Maid expected St Michael or even Christ Himself to testify for her at the trial when bishops and monks condemned her for heresy. Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc (1928) is famous for exceptionally telling the story of the trial from the point of view of the Maid and her entirely legitimate questions: If not for the most fervent martyrs for the faith, for whom will God deign to break his silence and show an inkling of his power? When will God right all the wrongs?And if life is such a precious divine gift, why does God expect its faithful to throw it away when faced by the prospect of martyrdom when a formal abjuration could preserve that life?These are inevitable questions for anyone who has ever been a Catholic. We are brought up to beg for the opportunity to be challenged to throw away the miseries of our mortal lives in witness of fervent faith and hope of eternal life.And yet, even Jesus, the first and most obvious martyr, wailed at the torment of the abandonment and loneliness left by the deafening silence of God. 'Father, why have You forsaken me?' Would this not be a good time for that drama You pulled at my baptism at the hands of John?A younger Martin Scorsese made The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). If Jesus was man, and his suffering was to mean anything, he could not be exempt from the doubt and fear that the afterlife and the eternal righting of wrongs may be a hoax.Back when that film was out, the Catholic hierarchy rattled their fatwas at the notion of Jesus the Man wishing, even for a moment, for a long life with a wife and relative prosperity.But Jesus is no example to other humans if he cannot be imagined to have the desires of other humans: sex, money, life itself. The basic needs so devoutly to be wished for while nailed to a cross facing oblivion for a trumped up charge.And, what's worse, on behalf of a God who cannot be bothered to look at the scene for long enough to comment and comfort by some evidence or experience of His presence.Silence, is a retelling of The Last Temptation of Christ, without the confusing dogmatic debate of the duality of the Jesus figure. Instead, the heroes are 17th century Portuguese missionaries smuggled into Sengoku Japan where Christianity was banned and persecuted.Several critics have complained about the white man's burden perspective of a story on missionaries. We no longer approve of the zeal of proselytisers and we are embarrassed by the damage done in the name of the cross throughout the globe in what was arrogantly called the Age of Discovery.But the film is perfectly conscious of the incoherence, the intellectual arrogance, the disruptive and destructive venom of proselytization. It has several Japanese characters, suspiciously gracious, polite and enlightened to the extent that they are probably better representatives of our sensibilities of our time than any historically accurate bailiffs of the Nagasaki regime, making the point and poking the logical holes in Christian zeal even as they boil, behead and burn stubborn anonymous cross-wielders with a very vague appreciation of theology.But this is no historical drama, in spite of all the trappings of a Kurosawa dramatization.This is about the questions Jesus asked on the cross, and following his example, the doubts of all the Joans, Lawrences, Catherines and so on when faced by martyrdom purely on a matter of point.Why will not God speak up? How can I know God has chosen me to suffer this death and what if, after all he has not?The Jesuits in this story have different answers to those questions and the answers they give determine in one way or another their fates. But, they must wonder, where the answers they came up with truly their own, or was God thinking through them?I disagree with those who described this film excessively devotional. Devotion requires fervour, and fervour is the abject abandonment of doubt. This film is about doubt.I do not believe in God. But I always think of Him, and wonder if He thinks of me too. It is not just an artist's identity that is distilled by his work. It also distills the identity of the viewer and this film has touched mine.",Silence

408,mike234432,"But what if you keep rooting for the ""bad guys""",4,25 October 2021,"When making a movie about religion, one must make absolutely certain not to enter with conjecture. This movie makes a very big one, which is that Christianity is ""the truth"".Let's get the good things out of the way.The scenery is stunning, and the cinematography is quite sublime in some parts. In other's it's mediocre, but never bad. That's about all good I can say about this movie.The actors were used exceptionally badly. Everyone was made to do an obnoxiously stereotypical accent in an effort to keep the majority of this movie in English dialogue, which speaks to what the intended audience of this movie was supposed to be, and that is a very small, very select group of people, who no doubt would appreciate this nod in their direction. Because of this awful decision, most of the acting is extremely watered down and good actors who otherwise could have done a lot with these roles were essentially shackled by the limitations of their permitted language.The movie is very long, overly long. A lot of the points are repeated far too many times. Once you've seen a Christian Japanese get tortured once, you've seen one get tortured a thousand times. There was no need to keep repeating these scenes, especially since they seemed to have varied in stakes. Normally you're supposed to raise them, but at the start of the movie it was all death by cross, then somewhere in the middle it's mercy for formalities, then bloodletting, then psychological torture, yet the initial scenes were the ones that hit the hardest, and the following ones lacked the necessary impact to keep the tension going.Now the worst ""sin"", if you will, this movie commits, and it's a cardinal one at that, is that it ASSUMES that the missionaries are good. That they are right. That they have the moral high ground. The bias here is almost palpable. It permeates within every second of this movie. At no points are any conquests of the Americas mentioned. At no point is the European schism mentioned. No protestants, no catholic, just Christian. That's not how that happened. This wasn't the only book written about the European conquest of Japan. John Clavell's ""Shogun"" is a much more historically friendly account. But it's from a point of view of a Dutchman, not the Portuguese. And I can tell you right now that the Portuguese were arrogant and foolhardy in their attempts to conquer Japan, and yes, this was an attempt at a conquest. But this time, the natives weren't just some natives living in shacks in a forest. These people were not only equal to Europeans in cultural and scientific advancements at the time, but in some ways superior. This wasn't going to be a walk in the park, they were too smart for that. And their culture was vastly different. Their value of life, death, individuality, honor, they were so far removed from ours that initially Jesus was laughed at because ""only a fool would die in such a dishonorable way as crucifixion."" The values of sacrifice for the poor and evil didn't make Jesus a hero in their eyes. It made him a lunatic. None of this was ever mentioned in the movie. Nor was the class system, or the lightness with which others were killed. Christians were not the only ones being slaughtered. And slaughter was not even the bad part in their eyes. The politics barely made it into it, even though they were the predominant driver for all of these eventsBut... you can't have politics in a movie if you want Christianity to look good, we all know that. The Jesuits didn't come to Japan to help the poor and the needy. They came to Japan to make money through silk trade. They came to rob the natives of what they had under the presumption of European cultural superiority.If you understand the Japanese value of life at the time, what the Japanese did to the Christian wasn't even close to evil. It was the most reasonable and well mannered proposal from an oppressive ruling class. ""A nail that sticks out gets hammered"" as the Japanese say. You either fall back in line and be like the rest, or you get hammered. We know you stood out, we know you're trying to convert to a different religion, we give you a choice to give it up and go free, or refuse and die. Sure, it's not really a nice choice to make, but these people at least had one. I didn't see no crusaders slashing through the middle east ever giving anyone that choice. Or the Spanish conquistadors doing the same in America. And yet the Japanese are evil because they don't want a volatile foreign influence to upset the peasant population into riots. Please, grow up.The only people who would enjoy this movie for anything other than its visuals, are the people who share the preconceived bias of the people who made this film. That their faith, the Christian faith, is the right one. That it's the truth. Because only in that context is anything in this film ever justified.",Silence
409,tordaniel91,Misses it's target,1,12 March 2017,"First is to be said. This film is not at all written from a faith perspective.Because of the direction the film took, I also does not see, how it really honour the Japanese martyrs. Those who gave their life in the name of Jesus. Something, I feel, give the whole film deep issues. Therefore I can not recommend it.The film do depict hidden christians. Which today is also a reality in countries like North Korea, and Iran. And was, for sure, a reality in Japan. But seem to honor the fallen priests, denying their faith, more then the ones, holding on to faith. While the history of the Japanese church is not encouraging, and an important part of Japanese history, the point-of-view given in the film, seem to be far off, if the goal was to, in an honorable way, depict Christian persecution.The main character in the film, Rodrigues, also ends up going away from his faith - after, for longer time, encouraging the Japanese people to deny their faith. At one point, it seem to be the thought also of the one who wrote the film itself, to be the ""correct"" way. Where Rodrigues (voice) say about Kichijiro, where he spits on the cross, that he was the only one ""victorious"", while the ones going to meet their death as martyrs was not. From this point, I feel the whole film also goes in a downwardly spiral.At last. What is supposed to be the voice of God speaking, in the film, asks Rodrigues to step on a picture of Jesus to deny his faith. Strongly opposing the bible. I think the film misunderstands what faith is, greatly. And sadly, does not pay respect to the martyrs - or the persecuted church of today.Daniel",Silence

413,nero2142,"A good Scorsese, but not a great one",7,11 February 2017,"I didn't have incredibly high expectations when going into ""Silence"". Scorsese is a very solid filmmaker in my opinion, but I do not think that it would be fair to measure him by the same standards by which you would measure a Tarkovsky, Kubrick, or Kurosawa.""Silence"" is a good film. It has some strong imagery, a coherent narrative, a slow but progressive buildup, and a decent plot. But it is not a masterpiece, it simply cannot live up to a ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Raging Bull"". Here are my main criticisms:The pacing was slow, but it kept going, and that was perfectly fine. It did however go awry towards the end. Two and a half hours is a while for a film, so you better wrap it up poignantly. This however did not happen. Spoiler: The film had several points, where a cut and an ending would have made sense, but instead it kept on going, throwing the dynamic off the balance. The first one of these was when Rodrigues had the choice whether to step on the icon to save his fellow Christians or not. God talked to him (in a slightly awkward fashion), he took the step forward, and on goes the story. Now this is excusable, but then we have Rodrigues and Ferreira sorting out Christian and non-Christian trade goods, which gave rise to another possibility of making a cut (e.g. them approving of goods of which they can tell that they have a Christian connotation, which the guards can however not recognize; if you look at the guards' facial expressions during the scene, you notice that they seem quite uncertain about some of the products). This was even amplified when the quite out-of-place voice of Dutch trader Dieter Albrecht appears out of nowhere to artificially prolong the whole scenario. We begin with narration, end with narration, and have a full cycle, but that did not happen either. Instead we go to his new family, see his continued devoutness, and we're still not done. First we need another scandal, more icky narration, and, finally, Rodrigues' death, just to show him holding the little icon in his dead palm. This point of true devotion was already made sufficiently, and could have been concluded upon decisively earlier.Secondly, we have the narration itself. Even though this film spans 161 minutes, it leaves almost no breathing space. Here it seems like shots cannot stand on their own: they have to accompanied by some sort of narrative, explaining you what exactly you see, rather than giving you the opportunity to reflect and make up your own mind. Film is, first and foremost, a visual medium, and images need a certain space to flourish fully and effectively. Stuffing every little scene with some sort of auditory description takes away from cinema's cinematic aspect, and does the film more bad than good if you ask me, because the visuals were there. The cinematography got better and better throughout the film, and probably reached its apex in scenes such as the one where Rodrigues himself steps on the icon, but good cinematography alone cannot save a film, as the medium is an interplay of various different aspects. The crucifixion scene was strong as well, but the eventual narration pulled it down a bit it in my opinion, as it really was redundant.The last point I noticed is just a minor criticism in the field of suspension of disbelief, so take it with a grain of salt or two: the film itself has a very serious topic, and also tries to address it in that manner, but sometimes it is almost as if a certain kind of comedy is being provoked. The story focuses on Portuguese Christian missionaries, conducting their secretive work in 17th century Japan. It thus seems a bit weird that everybody, particularly impoverished people from the countryside, get by using English, while a lot of the high officials quite clearly struggle with said language. And of course it makes sense that the Japanese in the film would speak English with quite a strong accent mostly, but why bother including scenes when the Japanese try to pronounce English terms and the Portuguese cannot understand them? Is it to show their deep devotion, to create a certain kind of humour among the likes of being burned alive and sea crucifixions, or is just to seem more ""authentic""? This one I am a bit puzzled about, but surely it is more of a minor question. The acting was compelling for the most part, but at times it seemed a bit off as well. Adam Driver's performance here is definitely not comparable with his role in Jarmusch's ""Paterson"", but then again I didn't expect it to be either.All in all, despite the criticism that I have regarding ""Silence"", it is a solid piece of Scorsese directing, that can probably be watched without too many regrets. I cannot universally and doubtlessly recommend it to each and everyone though. If you however cherish compelling cinematography, feel free to give it a try, as the Oscar bid for that category (its only one) seems well-deserved.",Silence

417,jacopo-salvadori2014,The supremacy of Silence,8,5 February 2017,"Sometimes, silence can be the most powerful scream. This is the case for Martin Scorsese's latest motion picture, in which silence figuratively expresses the real essence of the film. Developing this project in his mind for over 25 years, the legendary director has recently released what I consider to be his most powerful, self-reflective, and personal masterpiece: Silence. Behind the extensively protracted production of this movie, lies Scorsese's reluctance in embracing such an influential story – an outright spiritual journey. Raised in a strictly catholic environment, the American iconic director always had a special reverence towards religion, humbly asserting it in the majority of his works, from Mean Streets (1977) to The Last Temptation of Christ (1988). However, in Silence, the director does not employ faith to enrich the allusions and implications of his films, but rather he openly questions it, in a way that could seem disrespectful and hypocritical towards his mystical belief. One of the main characteristics of the film is its lack of soundtrack, echoing the title's significance. A cinematic silence that unequivocally joins and mirrors the main theme of the motion picture: the silence left by God. A silence that Father Rodrigues – a 17th century, young Jesuit priest sent to Japan in search for his mentor – struggles with, and refuses to accept. Alternating astonishing exotic panoramas to harsh, violent torture sequences, the movie indulges in deep philosophical reflections about the figure of God, his indifference towards human beings, and his diversity among other cultures¬; a God that assumes many shapes, that embodies the concepts of vanity, of redemption, of sacrifice and of salvation, while manifesting his omnipotence through the perpetuating silence. Father Rodrigues identifies himself with Jesus Christ because of the agony that they both had to suffer in their lives in order to spread the Christian faith, resulting in a form of narcissism. At the same time, the Japanese people that embrace the Catholicism brought by the missionaries, are actually gripping to their only glimpse of hope, merely conceiving God as a material advantage rather than a spiritual entity. Therefore, Silence, rather than being a film questioning religion, is more a reflection upon the human interpretations of it. It traces the steps of Apocalypse Now (1979), presenting a ""soldier"" in a hostile Asiatic location in search of an obscure mentor who has abandoned his ideology, embracing the enemy's, and constructing a mystical aura around his persona. The ""colonel Kurtz"" of Silence is Father Ferreira, played by a charming Liam Neeson, a disenchanted priest that apostatized in favor of Buddhism. For Rodrigues, Ferreira used to be a pillar, the personification of faith, and his apostasy inevitably crumbles the young priest's belief. Scorsese's choice of casting Neeson is not casual, of course, because during his career, the actor has already portrayed the figure of a strong, righteous priest, both in Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002) and in Mission (1986), as a missionary who prefers to die rather than renounce to God. Therefore, Scorsese was confident that Neeson would have been a familiar, 'trusted' priest for the majority of the viewers. Just as Sergio Leone did in Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) with actor Henry Fonda, Scorsese reversed the archetype, from positive to negative, from staunch to unfaithful, generating a sense of confusion in the audience, that parallels Father Rodrigues' chaotic uncertainties. Another interesting characteristic to consider, is that Silence follows what I like to call the ""Scorsese pattern"": a very detailed, slow opening, that in its greatness does not necessarily drive the plot forward, focusing more on shaping the characters, and an extremely quick ending, that summarizes lengthy periods of time, often several years, in a few minutes. Moreover, the protagonist starts from nothing, throughout the film he reaches his peak, and then he dramatically falls down, in an unsatisfying dissolution. This pattern can be seen in most of the director's films, such as Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The Wolf of Wall Street and Casino. In the end, the disenchanted protagonists don't necessarily lose everything, but they are far from the pedestal where they used to reside, now nostalgically conformed to normality. In my opinion, Silence deserves to be remembered among the director's greatest accomplishments. In this occasion, he exploits cinema to explore his intimate anxieties on religion, and if Scorsese considers cinema sacred, almost a religion itself, he definitively managed to became the patron saint of it.",Silence

And as soon as they arrive to Japan, a series of events was set in motion to emphasize the controversial question we have all been asking ourselves: ""Is there a god?"" First, I must say, this could have been a boring and dull movie. However, under the hand of a veteran director like Martin Scorsese, the story became thrilling and deeply haunting, with the setting in Japan (Shot in Taiwan) just make it more beautiful. As a Christian converted from Buddhist myself, I find a resemblance of my concern within the context of this movie. While it is unquestionably faithful to Christianity, Martin successfully balanced the movie to make you have to question yourself is there a god and is he listening to our prayer. That is quite impressive, considering that he is Catholic. The movie also showcase how incredibly good the trio main characters are and so are the Japanese actors. They were so good that even though the movie was filled with dialogue for 3 hours long, I never look away from the screen.

How can God remain silent in the face of such atrocities.

I have read a bunch of different reviews about this film. Some praise it, some say its one of the most boring movies they ever stumbled upon that only religious people will enjoy.For starters this is a very slow phased movie that will take a lot of patience to sit through. I cant say that it is pro-Christian or anti- Christian, because there are several ways to interpret this movie. How far would you go to keep your faith intact, how much suffering you would go through or seeing other people suffer and get tortured before renouncing god? It raises some important questions.""Silence"" is a very intelligent film, that will make you put your thinking cap on whether you are religious or not (open mind). Overall very great acting from the cast. Especially Garfield and the Japanese actors in supporting roles. Felt like Driver needed some more screen time though, he didn't have that big of an impact in ""Silence"". The cinematography is stunning which was noticed by the Academy by a nomination on best cinematography-category. Hard movie to rate and to find enjoyable, but in few years this might just be known as an overlooked masterpiece.

The most balanced film I've seen regarding Jesuits and the introduction of Christianity to a native people was ""The Mission"", directed by Roland Joffre from 1986.

This is the impression I got from the trailers, it was not that at all. This is a film that is about how people with a faith will not be broken of their faith no matter the circumstances or consequences, and this film shows that with some incredibly powerful and gut wrenching scenes. The visuals in this film are fantastic the location, the cinematography was outstanding this is a great looking movie one of the best looking films of the year, one particular scene that I enjoyed the main character is in a jail cell and the camera is peeking through each gap in the cell to show what is happening outside it was surprisingly effective and just helps to make the scene that much more impactful.The performances of the our two main characters (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) are impeccable, particularly Andrew Garfield he did an amazing job and definitely an Oscar worthy performance by him. Also Liam Neeson was surprisingly good in this film. Now onto the negatives, my biggest problem with this film is its just too long, I found myself thinking this scene is too long and could have been shorter, I also feel as though the pacing is very slow which is okay as long as the scenes are meaningful to the story but a lot of scenes of the film is our main character reliving people of their sins which is okay to show once or twice to show how the people rely on the two characters but, showing it about 10 different times throughout the film makes it at times uninteresting and a little boring. By no means am I saying this is a poorly edited film was I personally thought it was editing very well in general but my biggest problem was the run time and how some of the scenes were a little repetitive at times.Overall I give this film a 9/10, another great film by Martin Scorsese with an incredible plot and outstanding visuals.",Silence

But to me, Goodfellas was the movie that made me want to make movies that inspire, shock, emote, and floor audiences beyond the theater. So the first time when I heard that Martin Scorsese was making a movie about historical Japan based on a book he read even before making Goodfellas. So some time later, the movie was released and I tried to see it in theaters mainly because I thought it was amazing that we still get the chance to see a Martin Scorsese in theaters(seriously think about it, how awesome that is!). Unfortunately I couldn't see it the few theaters that it was in because life is unfair, but that didn't stop me from buying the Blu-Ray, along with Arrival. I even tried to watch it on the biggest TV in my house and then turn off all the lights to replicate the feel of the movie theater. Then I watched it and I got to say, I had no idea what to expect but after letting the film sit with me after a while, I can definitely say that this film is in the same league as the classics that gave Martin Scorsese his status & love for over the 5 decades.The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is pure eye candy for those who crave amazing storytelling, the editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is gold standard of how to edit a film, the casting, the production design, just about every single aspect & effort put into this film was beyond worth it. The acting and directing on display is the template I'll be following for movies that I'll hopefully get to make in the future.To me this is a movie that needs to be discussed especially today, not because of how the world is today but for truly understand why we do what do, what does it mean to be human, etc. In the film we get to someone who is at the top of his game but as he progresses down so far, it's just absolutely heartbreaking.

431,Ilusindarim,Kurosawa Tribute,8,28 January 2017,"This movie feels like a love letter to classic Kurosawa movie making and I think Scorcese nails it. There's a bit of Tarkovsky in the storytelling as instead of feeling sympathy towards the heroes and malevolence towards the villains, you end up with a sense of indifference and a reminder that not every villain is evil.The movies biggest flaw is probably the lack of direction at times, yet I am unsure how deliberate this was by the filmmakers. As an obvious homage to Kurosawa and a possible one to Tarkovsky I enjoy this method of storytelling. It allows the viewer to interpret the story themselves, rather than saturating the movie with needless exposition and dialogue to reinforce a point. Sure, this isn't Goodfellas, but instead its a total different direction for Scorcese to tell a story and I think this film is beautiful. Is it Scorceses best work?

However I was left extremely disappointed by Silence from start to finish. I found the attention to small details of 17th century Japan was the only saving grace in a film where the acting, imagery and length especially were very drawn out and, to be honest, I was glad when it was all over.I have no idea why if none of the three main Portuguese characters can actually do a Portuguese accent they wouldn't just speak normally or use actors that could do the accent. The imagery of stepping on an image of Christ was used so repeatedly with so little happening in between it was difficult to remain interested or for the act itself to hold its importance. There was very little to endear any of the characters to the audience apart from characters that played too small a role. Many of the scenes in this film are needlessly long and really do beg the question of why this film has seemingly been constructed to take so long to tell the story that it needs to. I realise many people will have read the book and so may be able to look past this - I understand as well that this film may be viewed differently by people who have faith to how I viewed it myself. Having said this rather than let another Scorsese fan get sucked in by a trailer that looks to tackle a very interesting period in history I thought it best to warn people that you won't get these three hours of your life back.",Silence
435,elias-58320,"the celebration of apostasy, failures again!",1,8 January 2017,"Martin Scorsece does it again. Another movie about losers. This fictional story (not a true story) is about Catholic priests that gave up (losers) and spent 40 years of their lives working against the church and helping dictators persecuting Christians. How is that a good story? How is the celebration of apostasy a good story? St. Ignatius Loyola must be rolling in his grave. If this movie gets an Oscar is because the Academy hates the church and this movie makes priests look like weak-minded failures.A good portion on the movie is narrated by the most annoying voice they found. Also disappointed by Liam Neeson portraying the character of a dud. He strikes me more like a hero, a Jedi, a savior of the weak, butThe characters in Scorsese movies are either losers that end up killed, in jail, captured, getting a lobotomy or living in misery no happy endings, no heroes, no saints just failures. Save your money and skip this failure of a film.",Silence
436,donwaz,'Silence' could use a good dose of it's title,2,3 January 2017,"'Silence' could use a good dose of it's title. Scorsese smothers his film with unnecessary, repetitive narration. Powerful imagery, what little there is, is obscured by a narrator constantly telling you what just happened, often over and over again. There's no better example of this than the very start of the film. In a gruesome example of the Japanese assault on Christian theology, a group of Catholic priests are tortured and killed. What should be a powerful scene setting the stage for the rest of the film is blunted by a torrent of emotionally disconnected narration out of sync with the events on screen. Not since Blade Runner has narration marred a film so thoroughly. Scorsese has talked about struggling with how to realize the film's big moment at the end. Turning it into a needle in a haystack is not the answer he was looking for. This film needs a top to bottom reedit with a good sound team.",Silence

Even among those, I can recognize good film making...this is NOT good film making or good basic storytelling. Repetitive, dragged out foreshadowing so that the only people who seemingly don't know what is going to happen next are the people in the film, and plot and character inconsistencies that you could drive a whole religion through. And it is LONG. 45 minutes would have easily captured this story and done so with more suspense (less dragging foreshadowing) and more horror. By the time each act of torture happens, everyone but the stupidest priest who ever lived knows exactly what is going to happen and it loses its effect. Speed this up, and it might be compelling. Right now, it is like a third grade story...and then...and then...and then...and then...we have to see every moment in time of the whole freaking story.If this film had any other director, it would never ever ever see the light of day in a theatre. And awards? Really shameful pandering, a mockery of great film making and a great director, who went off the rails with this.",Silence

Positives were an insight into Japanese religious culture at the time but other than a complete anti-climatic, repetitive and down-right exhausting three hours of cinema.Liam Neeson is unconvincing and on screen for probably twenty minutes of the 240 running time.

How is that even a movie.Failure of Christians and triumph of Buddhists. Another Martin Scorsese cold, evil slap on the Catholic Church and Christianity for that matter. You would think that after 28 years of his ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" failed movie, Scorsese would learn not to betray his Christianity. But he does it with hidden evil messages.In this long movie, you get so bored and tired that you don't really realized that a good portion of it is narrated by a horrible evil-hypnotizing voice.

Padre Rodrigues not only completely undermines the sacrifices made by his and God's followers, but he commits heresy and leads many, many souls astray by caving in and writing against his own Faith. Liam Neeson's performance is pitiful. I suppose that's a testament to how this usually good actor battled with his own conscience and could not act his way out of it. Andrew Garfield is a big let-down in the second part of the movie. Again, all that build up for not only being a quitter, but a traitor in the worst way you can be.

441,jvkahle,This movie is a bad joke. Expensive Anti-Christian Propaganda,1,15 January 2017,"You can black list me if you want, but I'm going to save some people from wasting their money. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is also extremely disappointing because you can see how much money was completely wasted that could have gone to a good cause. People are starving and suffering today in the world and somebody thought this was a great idea? How sad! It serves absolutely no good purpose at all and, after three hours of misery, leaves you feeling like going out and having a few stiff drinks to get the bad taste out of your mouth. I don't know if this story is true or not, but even if it is based on truth, why somebody would go to such great lengths to choose this tiny snapshot of Christianity and Japanese culture in a long movie just to bring people's spirits down is beyond my comprehension. In my opinion, it is nothing more than mean-spirited, anti-Christian propaganda and doesn't prove anything or teach any kind of good lesson at all. It doesn't even represent true Christianity at all. This is already a touch subject and this will only make ignorant people more ignorant and less likely to seek the truth. And I don't think it represents Japanese culture very well either. It is all taken out of context just to mock people's faith. I sincerely hope this film doesn't deter anyone from seeking God and seeing the hope of goodness in people which is obviously the whole purpose of this garbage. With all of the evil films being pumped out today, and really the last decade, I wish one single person who had the means to do so, would produce something positive, good and true. Hollywood and the entire film industry with all of its actors has truly gone down the tubes in a big way and this film shows it. It should have never even gained any traction. Liam Neeson? Disappointing! I am no longer a fan. How can anyone stoop so low for money? Horrible.",Silence
442,worth_the_trip,Deserving of better.,9,29 April 2017,"Firstly, I'd like to point out that many of those who give this film a low score are rather transparent in their bias against the subject material - we get it, it's hard for you to sympathize with the Christians in this film when you share your disdain of Christianity with the people persecuting them throughout. i.e. you need not be religious to appreciate this film, but atheists without a shred of respect or understanding of faith and religion need not apply.For those interested in a well-written, well-acted period piece highlighting the trials of early missionaries and the persecution they faced at the hands of a culture they didn't understand and whom did not understand them, you may be delighted to find a thought-provoking, if not altogether sobering film about faith and ignorance.One of Scorsese's best and most beautifully shot films to date, but unfortunately won't receive all the praise it deserves in this current world climate; a problem much akin to the hate directed at Christians in this film.",Silence

That being said, what this movie wants to promulgate is a recreation of the movie mentioned above in Japan! Now its known that in the years between 1603 and 1868 there was the Edo period affected by foreigners and different cultures which only led to a growth in economy and probably some Christianity influences, but to recreate an historical film into Japan believes and to make a Christian priest a martyr....no. I am truly sorry Martin, I do not know how you were influence to do this but..just no, pure and simple. All respect for the actors that performed in this movie. P.S.

As boring as it eventually was, maybe you shouldn't have made it. I've seen better movies by your ideas and direction but gosh this is just beyond boring. And the fact that you had rave reviews over this movie makes me wonder... Are the reviews great because you Scorcese or what? In my mind, I'd hoped you spent 20 years with something fantastic instead of 2 catholic priests going to Japan to find another ex-catholic priest.

Since Scorcese had brilliantly created the in depth dialog on the existence of our faith and believe. On basic questions of the truth. The human struggle with their own faith to the divine and themselves. Cinematography is exquisite on a level when a headless body created a poetic trail of blood on the sand. Amazing mixture of zen and the faith of Christianity. Conversation in the temple are such a setting that the idea of having them there, just make it more reflective in a whole new level.

The story is threadbare, it really doesn't exist in many ways and is very very repetitive. There really only exist 1-2 characters that aren't just hollow shells there to further the story. You can see exactly whats going to happen around 30 minutes before it happens, and there lies this movies biggest flaw, it's length. Everything goes on and on and on about the exact same thing for around 1h 30 min. With little to no progression, those 1h and 30 minutes of story goes like this: Repent your religion, No, *something bad happens*, repent your religion, No, *something bad happens* and on and on and on. Honestly this movie had potential but it needed someone who can actually write a story and not include the same thing for hours.

453,azzyk-68854,"This is Not a ""Faith-Based"" Film, This is a Tragedy. A Great Cinematic Experience.",8,14 March 2018,"The technical genre of this film would be ""Tragedy"". I say this because the movie treats itself very seriously, and there is a ton of sorrowful or terrible events taking place around the main character who can be classified as a ""heroic"" individual. The purpose of tragedies is to watch them, look at all the bad things happening to the hero, because of the hero, and by the hero, and then afterwards reflect. This movie is definitely going to make you reflect on some things. If it doesn't, eh...oh well, you still watched a quality movie. If you like tragedies, this movie is a must. Scorsese has made a beautiful piece with great atmosphere, beautiful shots, (oh gosh) scenes with MEANING and PROGRESSION. The story is complete, thoroughly explained, and ends on a positive note. I don't feel like I've wasted my time investing emotionally in characters that the story will just throw away when they fulfil their purpose. This film was not lazily madeThis film is a bit on the slow side, totaling to 2 hours and 41 minutes. If you are very impatient, this film isn't for you. If you aren't very analytical/observational, this film will most likely not be for you. If you are a cynic, or purely intellectual and not very spiritual, there is a VERY HIGH chance this film is not for you. Their are some real intense topics that this movie will delve into that take time to process. If you didn't really understand the topics before, this movie is not going to reveal anything you can't get somewhere else in a better way.Those who think this film is a ""Faith-Based"" Film, IT IS NOT. I REPEAT IT IS NOT A ""FAITH-BASED"" FILM. People comparing it to movies like Passion of the Christ or War Room are comparing apples to oranges. Just because the movie has Christianity in it, does not make this a Christian film. If anything, this is the worst movie to try and build a natural and/or spiritual understanding of the religion simply because answers are very vague and are completely left up to interpretation. ""Faith-based"" films will leave nothing up to interpretation and tell you flat out the one thing and only thing it is about, faith. This film was not purposed to do that. This film is purely a historical drama about tragic events that happened and how the protagonist makes choices during those tragedies. Thank you, Martin Scorsese, for making a good film that I can actually share with other people and not regret doing so.",Silence
454,robertpoljak,Atheist review :-),8,27 March 2018,"There are two ways to review this movie:1. Cinematografic POV: The film is quite long so there are scenes that are ""little boring"" or repeating. Acting is quite good but I got the feeling that it could be beter or maybe more emphasized. Photography and scenes are great, real, but not spectacular. Rating 72. Plot/Story POV: maybe all of the ""negative"" impressions stated in above comment were intended so that the focus would be on the story! It happened to me while watching the movie that when I thought the scene was ""boring"", too long, repeating, not spectacular .. that immediatelly made me change the focus on the whole story - you are constantly forced to think about the meaning of the religion, existence, beliefs,.... And this is great!! It is very powerful and meaningful movie so don't be mislead by those who just watch movies for entertainment and give bad reviews. Sometimes we have to consider that the movie does not have to be great from all points of view to be excellent.... Rating: 9Btw, I am an atheist and from my point of view it made me even more convinced about my feelings. I think that some religions has provoked too much damage in the history of the humanity, it has lost its true nature and it is misused.But nevertheless, i enjoyed the movie and I sincerelly respect Scorsese for his effort and also for his beliefs!",Silence
