0,TheLittleSongbird,A story that deserves to be loved,10,5 May 2018,"With such great source material, its high rating here, its very positive critical reception and a very relevant and important subject matter, interest was extremely high for 'Love, Simon'. There are also a lot of great films that mix comedic elements, serious elements, inspiring messaging and things to think about really well.'Love, Simon' turned out to be one of those films. One of the best in recent years for me and after so many underwhelming book-to-screen adaptations (though far more problematic as standalones for most), to see a book-to-film adaptation that is every bit as wonderful as its source material and treat it with respect was refreshing and admirable. Even more so was how it executed its subject matter and how much of a wonderful film it is on its own. One of my favourite films of the year so far, which is very high praise for a hit and miss year so far. Visually, 'Love, Simon' is very well made and looks lovely without being overly flashy and never being cheap. The music is both playful and soothing and sometimes with a melancholic edge, it's never intrusive, non-descript, misplaced or easily telegraphed. The direction is skilful in the direction of the actors, executing all the different elements individually beautifully and balancing them just as impressively. The characters for me were relatable and compelling in their realism and 'Love, Simon' is acted with a lot of heart, warmth and ease with the material.Especially great with 'Love, Simon' are the writing and storytelling. 'Love, Simon' has comedy that is genuinely funny and makes one laugh, drama that is really poignant that makes one cry, messaging that inspires and done with enough subtlety to not make laid on too thick and parts that really probe thought.Got a huge amount of the story, which was inspiring, life-affirming, very funny, quirky, extremely honest and very heartfelt. Haven't been through it myself, but know many people who have come out and opened up about their struggles with their situations and the best way to approach it and have always hugely admired their amazing courage to do so. It is a very brave and sensitive subject, and is neither heavy-handed or trivialised in how it's told here. Instead it's handled in a way that is incredibly easy to relate to, handled with sensitivity and honesty and holds a lot of relevance, it's something that can be misunderstood therefore an important one to address. The pacing never feels rushed or dull, instead it's just right and the ending is extremely sweet without being saccharine and touching without being over-sentimental or manipulative. Overall, really wonderful and totally deserving of all the love. 10/10 Bethany Cox","Love, Simon"
1,bkoganbing,Coming Out,7,10 May 2018,"This is going to drive the fundamentalists crazy. Imagine a film where the central
character is a gay teen coming to grips with his sexuality and his parents don't
immediately rush him into conversion therapy. Nevertheless a kid like Nick Robinson still has a lot to deal with, who doesn't at that age. Fortunately he's got
good friends and resources.While debating when and how to come out, Robinson who probably set this
person's gaydar on fire gets an e-mail from someone who says he's crushing
out on him. Something way back when I was a latently gay teen myself I
would never have dreamed of doing. Times have changed in over 50 years.Anyway Robinson has a dual problem of finding out his secret admirer and 
just how and when to come out. From my decades of observing each coming
out story is unique, each family dynamic is unique. No one can advise anyone
on when and where to make the decision, they have to decide for themselves.Anyway Robinson is a really likeable young actor and if you're going to have a
first same sex love you could do far far worse.I recommend this film highly, it should be seen by audiences everywhere.","Love, Simon"
2,SnoopyStyle,really like the characters,7,8 June 2018,"Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) has a nice life. His progressive parents (Josh Duhamel, Jennifer Garner) love him. His lifelong friend Leah (Katherine Langford) has a crush on him. Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) is his other lifelong friend and Abby (Alexandra Shipp) is their new best friend. Everything is great except that he is hiding his homosexuality. Someone is writing anonymous posts about being closeted and Simon starts a relationship with the unknown poster. Weirdo Martin discovers Simon's secret and blackmails him to get closer to Abby.This is a cute movie. I like the kids. I like the adults. The situation is light YA drama. It's all fine and cute. One reason that it's not more is that it doesn't elevate the drama. That's not to say that it doesn't have drama. When the protagonist downgrades the danger himself, the tension valve is released somewhat. Other than undermining the intensity, it also undercuts the reason to buckle to the blackmail. It would be infinitely less complicated to come out. At first, I thought he was simply being nice to Martin but at some point, it's easier to come out to all these liberals. His stated fear wouldn't make sense after he comes out to everybody and he can call it an act of bravery to Blue. The origin source of drama is questionable.My other issue is after the reveal. His friends could have connected the dots better but they don't. They aren't dumb but I would love the kids to be written smarter. Nick and Abby can still be mad at him. As for Leah, she can be heartbroken but I don't understand her anger. It's more appropriate for her to avoid him rather than pissed off at him. Coming out in the modern age is a compelling subject matter and drama can be had. I really like these characters other than Martin. It would be helpful to have a better villain with greater danger. This is cute. Despite the support, the trauma remains real and that's the message of the movie.","Love, Simon"
3,Horst_In_Translation,Some deep lows take away from the quality overall here,6,30 June 2018,"""Love, Simon"" is a new American movie from 2018 that runs for 110 minutes and is considered by many the perhaps defining film of the year when it comes to LBGT content, at least about younger people perhaps. Director is Emmy nominee Greg Berlanti and the script is by Berger and Aptaker, also Emmy nominees, who are mostly known now for their work on the recent hit series ""This Is Us"". Well anyway, the script for this film here is of course based on a novel and I am writing this review as somebody who has not read said novel, so I cannot really draw any comparisons to the original material and I will focus solely on the movie. Lead actor is Nick Robinson and I must say I do not really know him and he did not impress me too much here either. Looks a bit like a young James Franco, without the talent at this point still, but who knows what will be in the next 10 or 20 years. The supporting cast was okay. Duhamel did fine with what he was given. Garner had nothing to work with except one scene at the end where she is sadly as much over the top as usual. The real scene stealer is Veep's Tony Hale once again playing the principal here and he brings all the comedic delight the movie needs I would say. His material is just as good as his delivery and I would even watch a film that solely focuses on his character. Nuff said. As for the movie itself, it does not really drag and that is always good for a film that is closer to two hours than to ninety minutes. But sadly, there are some really weak moments. The fact that the character played by Logan Miller eventually publishes the coming-out did not fit at all. Yes he wasn't a friend really or anything, but the explanation to take attention away from what happened at the stadium is just ridiculous. As are the ways in which the protagonist deals with him afterward and the other way around too as he suddenly seeks his company and approval again. And the moment at the end when he says it's him that he is Blue and that he gives him additional coins is just pure cringe. As is the ending at the rollercoaster place as a whole. The film messed up big there and it's just embarrassing how they went for this kind of no-holds-barred happy ending. Lets keep in mind that Blue does not even want to reveal his identity for a truly long time to our ""hero"", but he agrees to enter the rollercoaster and reveal himself in front of hundreds of peers? Nah not happening. All for the sake of it and nothing to do with reality. I wish they could have left out the chat connection and Blue altogether and it would have been way better for the film. Also the ways in which the central character describes how he fell in love with the online identity is just ridiculous and extremely exaggerated. The film relies way too much eventually on the audience caring for who Blue is, especially as it's a guy we know almost nothing about. The better way would have been maybe to take Blue as an example of all the people out there in the real world and not connecting a face with the name, but encouraging them instead to be Blue and get public with who they are. On a side note, the part about heteros coming out was kinda funny, but still the approach is wrong as instead it should be about nobody having to come out in public and gay people simply presenting their new (boy)friend to their buddies and them reacting completely cool with it as if it's nothing special. Shame the film is not sending this message out with how much of an impact it seems to be having.But to the positive now, it really wasn't as bad as it may sound. The characters, down to the ones with virtually no screen time, were written authentically and entertainingly at the same time and that is always a challenge. Most of the actors did a fine job too. Yes there are some strange moments, like the refugee reference from the singer at the stadium, but even these were somewhat awkwardly hilarious and did not try to send a deep message. So from my rating you see that overall it was enjoyable if we ignore the key weaknesses, as difficult as this may be. The interactions between the friends were fun most of the time and felt right, maybe with the exception of how everything collapses for the main character, that was a bit too much over the top and how they leave instead of giving him solace. I especially liked those scenes with the young sister that felt kinda fun and it's nice she was referenced in the very first sentence basically. Every time the film moved away from Blue and stopped taking itself so seriously, it was a lot of fun. Also some nice musical references here about classic movies like ""Les Misérables"" and ""Cabaret"" I would say. This was certainly not the film some are making it out to be in terms of being defining for the genre because of how it depicts tolerance and homosexuality in our current world and that it really isn't too much of an issue anymore, but the message at its core is correct, the execution in terms of characters' actions maybe not 100% always. But it is as much of a film to enjoy for straight people as it is for gay audiences to appreciate. Worth checking out, but not a must-see overall I'd say. Could have been better with a stronger lead, but a final thumbs-up to Tony Hale, who proves what a chameleon he is. See it if the genre and plot sound appealing to you.","Love, Simon"
4,jboothmillard,"Love, Simon",7,9 May 2018,"I saw the trailer for this movie, it proved that Hollywood is definitely moving with the times, this was the first mainstream Hollywood movie to feature a central gay character, and I really hoped it would be as good as it looked. Basically Simon Spier (Jurassic World's Nick Robinson) is like any other teenage boy, attending high school in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, and he has a loving family and good friends, but he is hiding a big secret, that he has known about since youth. His parents, Emily (Jennifer Garner) and Jack (Josh Duhamel), his sister Nora (Talitha Eliana Bateman), and his three best friends, Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), Leah (Katherine Langford), and newcomer Abby (Alexandra Shipp), have no idea that he is gay. One day, Leah tells Simon that a closeted gay student at the high school, using the pseudonym ""Blue"", has made an online confession about his sexuality. Simon, using his own pseudonym ""Jacques"", begins communicating with Blue via email, the two confide personal details and form a connection. However, their emails are accidentally discovered by less than popular student Martin (Logan Miller), who is infatuated with Abby, Martin blackmails Simon, threatening to make his emails public, unless he agrees to help him win over Abby. Simon suspects his classmate Bram (Keiynan Lonsdale) may be Blue, he attempts to connect with him at a Halloween party, but later walks in on Bram making out with a female student. Simon lies to Nick, telling him that Abby has a boyfriend in college, to allow him get Martin and her together. Leah walks an inebriated Simon home, she speaks vaguely that she is fated to love one person intensely, Simon assumes she is referring to Nick. Simon meets Martin and Abby in a local diner, convincing them to practise lines for the upcoming high school musical performance of Cabaret, Martin and Abby seem to bond with each other. Simon bonds with diner worker, a classmate named Lyle (Joey Pollari), he believes he may be Blue, later that night Simon comes out to Abby, he is relieved she reacts positively. At a school football game, Simon crosses paths with Lyle again, but before he can ask him if he is Blue, Lyle tells him he is interested in Abby. Simon is upset, Martin is pestering him, in frustration Simon tells him to ""go big or go home"" when courting Abby. So, Martin interrupts the national anthem and publicly declares his feelings for Abby, but she admits she does not have the same feelings for him, Martin is humiliated and soon becomes the subject on intense ridicule. On Christmas Eve, to distract people from his own humiliation, Martin posts Simon's emails on the school gossip page, outing him to the entire school. Simon's sister Nora finds out about this and tries to comfort him, but he shuts her out and does not return frantic messages from his friends, he makes the decision to come out to his parents on Christmas morning, they are surprised but accepting. After the holidays, Nick and Abby have become a couple, they angrily confront Simon about the lies he told, they found out he tried to keep them apart due to Martin's blackmail. Leah confesses that she was in love with him, not Nick, she is upset that he came out to Abby and not her, as she would have accepted it. After being rejected by his friends, Simon receives a final email from Blue, who is upset that their emails were leaked, Blue tells him that they should stop talking and deletes him email account, Simon is devastated to have lost his friends and the mystery pen-pal he has fallen in love with. Two classmates mock Simon and openly gay student Ethan (Clark Moore) in the cafeteria, they bond over the difficulties they have faced coming out. Simon's parents reach out and comfort him, and Simon apologises to Leah, he posts a confession on the gossip site, apologising to his friends, and seeking out Blue, asking him to meet him at the school carnival. After the school musical, Leah, Nick and Abby make amends with Simon, they go with him to the carnival, Simon rides the Ferris wheel continuously awaiting the arrival of Blue, a crowd form to watch. When Simon runs out of tickets, Martin makes amends for his behaviour and buys him one more ride. Just before the ride begins, Bram sits next to him, revealing himself to be Blue, the kiss Simon saw with the female student was a drunken misunderstanding, they ride the Ferris wheel together and kiss as their friends cheer them on. Simon's life gradually returns to normal in the following year, he and Bram have begun a relationship, after picking up his friends and boyfriend for school, Simon suggests that they ""go on a little adventure"". Also starring Tony Hale as Mr. Worth, Natasha Rothwell as Ms. Albright, Miles Heizer as Cal and Drew Starkey as Garrett. Robinson gives a terrific performance as the adolescent anxious about reactions to his sexuality and desperate to know his anonymous pen-pal, Garner and Duhamel are great as the parents, and the other cast members, particularly Miller, are very good. This film is clearly styled like a John Hughes teen movie, but much more with the times, with social media playing a key role, and obviously the LGBT theme, it does have slightly predictable characters and bits you would expect in a teen movie, but it is witty, funny and very charming, a worthwhile romantic comedy drama. Very good!","Love, Simon"
5,studioAT,"A lovely film, with an important message.",7,5 April 2020,"Finally. A Hollywood studio producing a big LGBT romantic comedy.Based on the YA book this film is really something special.Not preachy, but heartfelt, this film deserves the hype and love from fans it has in turn earned.Well worth a watch.","Love, Simon"
6,preppy-3,Frustrating,1,30 June 2018,"Bad gay coming of age movie. Simon (Nick Robinson) is 17 and secretly gay. He wants to come out but is afraid. Then someone finds out and threatens to out him. What to do?Bad movie. The script is stupid, the characters annoying and it's incredibly condescending (hard to believe a gay man did this). The characters don't talk anything like any teenagers I've heard and they're all obviously older than 17. Also we have a saintly mother and father who accept their gay son right away. In fact it's made clear at the beginning that they would accept him no matter what. So where's the conflict and why is he so afraid of coming out to them? There are a few good moments but 90% of this film is boring, unbelievable and incredibly badly acted. Robinson is terrible in the lead role. I applaud that we're getting gay coming of age movies but do they all have to be this bad?","Love, Simon"
7,neil-476,Likeable coming out drama,8,1 May 2018,"Simon is a pretty ordinary high schooler with a secret: he is gay and hasn't come out which causes him some inner torment. Then another boy, calling himself ""Blue"", posts on the school website with similar issues, he and Simon start an online dialogue and find they are kindred spirits. The story involves various high school romance shenanigans, the key one of which is a threat, subsequently acted upon, to leak the emails between Simon and Blue, and out him publicly.Publicised inaccurately as a comedy drama, this is a likeable high school drama, with little comedy, addressing a genuine issue with compassion. Not everyone in a similar situation will be as lucky as Simon in terms of the unquestioning support he gets from his family, although I get the impression that things are slowly improving in that regard, in the western world at least.If I had a criticism of this film, it is that it struck me as somewhat glib. Simon's undoubted anguish at how he sees the consequences of coming out turn out to be more or less completely unfounded - his family fully supports him, his friends accept it unquestioningly (even his female best friend who is secretly in love with him goes ""Oh well"" to the extent of seeking his advice on drapes and soft furnishings (not really)), and the Blue issue is resolved safely and happily. The only negative notes are the blackmail subplot and the idiot homophobes whose attempted humiliation is quickly - and entertainingly - stamped on my the school establishment.But this is a good-hearted movie. It means well, delivers a positive message, and is populated by people in whose company the viewer feels happy. I liked it.","Love, Simon"
8,gradyharp,"'I need you to hear this: You are still you, Simon.'",5,16 June 2018,"I need you to hear this: You are still you, Simon.
Becky Albertalli's novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" has been adapted for the screen by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker and directed by Greg Berlanti and the result is a somewhat retrogressive (20+ years ago) view of coming out in high school. Things are different now not any easier perhaps but he general populace is far more gay knowledgeable than this little film suggests. The main driver of the film - a senior lad in high school searching on the computer to hookup with someone else in the world who is gay - is a bit far-fetched, but it is the line of thinking that keeps the movie afloat.The film is shot in Atlanta, Georgia and may be focused on that city's viewpoint. It is a young coming-of-age tale about a teenage boy, Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), goes through a different kind of Romeo and Juliet story. Simon has a love connection with a boy, Blue (and you have to wait until the last frame to discover who that is), by email, but the only problem is that Simon has no idea who he's talking to. Simon must discover who that boy is--who Blue is. Along the way, he tries to find himself as well. He is surrounded by good friends - Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Jorge Lendeborg Jr, Logan Miller, and Kelynan Lonsdale - understanding parents (Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner), a terrific drama coach (Natasha Rothwell), and the silly vice-principal (Tony Hale).There are many moments of wasted energy but a number of moments also of tenderness. The concept of the story is sound - if dated - and should be helpful to teenagers coming to grips with the LGBTQ life.","Love, Simon"
9,lasttimeisaw,a wholesome USA confection accomplishes that baby step of normalization which queer cinema truly needs presently,7,11 July 2018,"Plugged as the first major Hollywood studio movie featuring a gay protagonist and received a wide release in the home turf (and become quite a money-spinner, globally earns $64 million against a $14 million budget), the third feature from queer director Greg Berlanti, LOVE, SIMON is a milestone in a sense that the once-tabooed LGBT subject has finally (however belatedly) reached the threshold of normalcy in the United States as it is an unadulterated teen romance aiming to an impressionable young demography.Benefiting from its source novel's popularity and drawing on a John Hughes-que brisk tone, LOVE, SIMON has no pretense to become a massive crowd-pleaser with its positive vibes around coming-out, sincere friendship, familial support and looking for the anonymous ""Blue"", Simon's first crush, a pen-pal he bonds through emails (yes, Gmail is the inner sanctum for closeted teens). Simon Spier (Robinson), a typical American high-schooler, outfit by immaculate trappings: fairly good looks, fit physique, open-minded parents and thick-as-thieves friends, which all intend to deaden the gravity of his forthcoming coming-out, and it is a clever tactic well delivering the movie from the usual reaction of lachrymose dramatization or vehement opposition, that can be considered too passé at this point of human history. What is at stake is actually Simon's cordial friendship with his closest chums, namely Abby (Shipp) and Nick (Lendeborg Jr.), who are quite an item and whom Simon has thoughtlessly betrayed in order to comply with the blackmailing from a fellow student Martin (Miller), who stumbles on Simon's secret and craftily uses it to importune the latter to hook him up with the gorgeous Abby, then to appease his discomfiture after a public love-declaration fiasco, Martin selfishly outs Simon on the internet. There is a red flag here pertinent to the rather vexing Martin, albeit his unsavory behavior, the movie seems to make great effort to whitewash it as some minor characteristic foible (even with a tint of encouragement for his ""be himself"" candor and temerity), however, in reality, more often than not, it is not, Martin's failing to take the consequence might send a not-so-salubrious message to its susceptible core audience.By comparison, the portrayal of Simon is more sensible, he has several apologies to issue before riding to that first kiss, and it is very gratifying that it is not his sexuality that disappoints his friends but his senseless manipulation and insensitivity (the antediluvian trope of cottoning to one's best friend is still wielded as a plot device in secrecy, which does precipitate some eye-rollings here), that is ""the"" crux of the matter here, and it is a rousing experience to watch it unfold heartily in front of one's own eyes (especially when its relevance is too close to home on a personal level), and then paves the way for the saccharine but irresistibly adorable finale. Barring a vainglorious turn from Logan Miller, the cast is a fine conglomerate of sympathy, sincerity, charm and affection, both Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel punch above their weight as Simon's perspicacious mother and misty-eyed father respectively, which says a lot about the rest, especially a spontaneously bubbly Alexandra Shipp as the major discovery for this viewer. As our protagonist, Nick Robinson successfully sloughs off his miffed temperament in Colin Trevorrow's JURASSIC WORLD (2015), and brings about a genuinely affecting versatility out of his teen heartthrob carapace. Gingered up with catchy songs and music numbers (whether illusory or Cabaret-lite), LOVE, SIMON is a wholesome confection that has all the i's dotted and t's crossed, in order to accomplishes that baby step which queer cinema truly needs, for what it is worth, a watershed is set in stone, what's next, Hollywood?","Love, Simon"
10,Hellmant,"Could really relate to his emotional struggles (as well as his romantic ones, especially)!",9,16 March 2018,"'LOVE, SIMON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new coming-of-age rom-com based on the book 'Simon v. the Homo Sapiens Agenda' (by Becky Albertalli), which is the first film ever released by a major studio to center on a gay teen romance. It tells the story a closeted gay high school teen, named Simon, who tries to adapt to family and social life while maintaining his secret. He's also desperately trying to discover the identity of an anonymous gay classmate that he's fallen for, and deal with another classmate who's trying to blackmail him (by threatening to expose his homosexuality). It was directed by Greg Berlanti, and it was scripted by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger. The film stars Nick Robinson, Alexandra Shipp, Katherine Langford, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Logan Miller, Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel and Tony Hale. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be really sweet, touching and insightful. Simon Spier (Robinson) is a closeted gay teen attending high school in Atlanta Georgia. He's been wanting to tell his family and friends that he's gay, but he still hasn't gotten the courage to do it. He's recently started an online relationship with another closeted gay student, who he doesn't know the identity of. A straight classmate of Simon's, named Martin (Miller), discovers emails between Simon and his new online crush, and he threatens to expose them to the public unless Simon helps him impress one of Simon's friends, Abby (Shipp), who Martin has a crush on. Simon has to deal with all of this, as well as his increasingly complex feelings about who he is and his relationships with others too.The film seems to be an insightful story about what it's like to be a closeted gay teenager, while also remaining funny and amusing throughout. It's also really touching (I got teary-eyed multiple times during it), and relatable. I found a lot of the characters in it to be reallyrelatable actually, for various different reasons, especially Simon. Not because I'm gay (because I'm not), but because I can relate to being someone who feels extremely different, and afraid to show who they really are, because they know society won't accept them for it. Society doesn't accept me regardless, and Simon is definitely a lot more popular and cool than I've ever been, but I could still really relate to his emotional struggles (as well as his romantic ones, especially). The film is really well made, acted, and I'm sure it will become a beloved teen romcom classic for years to come. I think it's a movie that everyone should see.","Love, Simon"
11,MOscarbradley,an LGBT classic,9,19 April 2018,"A gay coming-out movie that is laugh-out-loud funny with a charm factor that goes all the way up to eleven, a star-making performance from its young lead and a great song score; yes, it can only be ""Love, Simon"", the feelgood movie of the current season and a delight for all but the most virulent of homophobes.Based on a YA novel it tells the tale of Simon, (a terrific Nick Robinson), a typical sweet-natured high-school jock whose secret is he's gay and who falls in love with another boy, who signs himself 'Blue', online. The problem is the other boy isn't out either and their correspondence must be anonymous. There are several candidates as to who Blue might be and we have to wait, as does Simon, to find out his identity. Perhaps what's most amazing about Greg Berlanti's film is that it's a product of Trump's America and like Simon himself, hopefully it will encourage a lot of other young adults to come out. An LGBT classic.","Love, Simon"
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Has something to say and says it well; enjoyable for all.,7,9 April 2018,"'Love, Simon (2018)' is an important film precisely because it is a big-budget, 'Hollywood' studio affair that's going to reach a wide audience, as opposed to a small indie flick or foreign language feature. The flick does a fantastic job at keeping the proper perspective, never allowing its protagonist's sexuality to overshadow his personality, and portraying the proper messages while 'normalising' what is essentially both its most unique selling point and its most mundane element. It feels like a regular, if well made, coming-of-age drama that goes through the motions but filters them through the perspective of its lead, in the way that the best entries in the genre must if they want to stand out. This makes for a fun and smart affair that has something to say and says it well but never forgets to be an entertaining movie that can be enjoyed by pretty much everyone. 7/10","Love, Simon"
13,bowmanblue,It wasn't like this in my day (sadly),7,10 April 2018,"There have been plenty of teen romantic comedies over the years and, being a cynical man in his forties, I have long since outgrown them and do my best to steer clear, knowing that I am definitely NOT the target audience for this type of film, therefore I shouldn't really be commenting on it. Nowadays, films are doing their best to be 'inclusive' and 'diverse' in their casting/storylines. Many times this feels forced and comes across as simply a gimmick to drum up a little extra word-of-mouth to help promote the film. 'Love, Simon' so could have been one of those, but I'm glad to say that it's not.A teenage boy (Simon, believe it or not!) is coming to the end of his senior school and leads a pretty normal life, apart from the fact that he's secretly gay. However, his plans of 'coming out' in his own time (possibly at college) are thrown upside down when he starts engaging in online correspondence with another - apparently gay - student. This leads to him rethinking his plans, so to speak.It's nice to see this kind of story given some sort of big-screen treatment. If you went to school back in my day (80s/90s) then everyone was heterosexual and no one was gay. Statistics prove again and again that that is impossible and 'no one' is gay simply because no one is going to commit what (again, back in my day) was 'social suicide' by 'coming out.' Now - thankfully - I understand that school-age children/young adults are much more at ease which letting people know who they really are without fear of negative reprisal (although 'Love, Simon' does show that side of people's reaction to such news from a fellow student). It's a bit of a 'who-done-it' really. I know I shouldn't, but I couldn't help but think of 'Scream' while I watched it. Although, technically, the films are nothing alike, 'Scream' makes you guess who the killer is from a cast full of potential young suspects, whereas 'Love, Simon' sees if you can figure out who the other student Simon is speaking to all the way through (for the record, I got the answer wrong in both films!).The young cast are all believable as friends and their banter is the type you'd expect among youngsters, plus there are plenty of swipes at the 'youth of today' that us 'oldies' will enjoy. The only real 'weak link' in terms of the casting was the one main representative of the teachers at the school, the vice principal. He was just way too wacky to be believable. The way he behaved just wasn't how a teacher would (or at least, once again, I'm going off my own experience back in the day - feel free to correct me if this is 'normal' for a teacher!). In my opinion he was more like Krusty the Clown from 'The Simpsons' than someone who was supposed to educate. Plus I'd have probably ended the film about ten minutes earlier than it did - you'll probably see where I mean if you watch it.But, those were just minor gripes, the film is excellent and uplifting, even for an old cynic like myself. School life wasn't like this in my day and, if this is the way it's going, it's definitely a step in the right direction.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","Love, Simon"
14,ThomasDrufke,"Overstuffed, but nonetheless moving",7,16 August 2018,"Coming from the creator of essentially every CW show currently on air, Greg Berlanti, I didn't know what to expect from Love, Simon. Being that his first film wasn't well received several years ago, how would he bounce back after being hailed as a television genius. Well, it's fair to say he did quite well. Love, Simon is not only a good coming of age film, but a touching romantic drama as well. The catch being that no one knows Simon is gay and he's been secretly communicating with another gay classmate over the internet, who is also unknown. It becomes a story about identity and empathy, and how everyone deals with their true selves differently. I liked that this movie had several moving pieces and it always kept you guessing as to who the ""mystery person"" Simon was communicated with was. However, I'm not sure the payoff was worth the wait. Fair or not, I was hoping for a more clever conclusion the film long mystery, even if that means using a cliche here or there to get to that point. The film also suffers from one too many characters that Simon has an emotional beat with. Just as you start to connect with his mom, dad, sister, or one of his many friends, the film moves on to the next person. And never truly lets you feel the weight of one of those particular bonds breaking or coming back together. In that way, it's a little too stuffed with material, which is not to say any of them are bad sequences, just not fulfilling. With that said, there are undoubtedly great moments of heart and levity which makes for an always enjoyable film, just not a complete one.7.4/10","Love, Simon"
15,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,10 June 2018,"Love, SimonThe good thing about coming-out in high school is everyone all ready calls you gay.Unfortunately for the teenage in this dramedy, everyone thinks he's super-straight.Ladies man Simon (Nick Robinson) is actually a closeted senior who is caught having an online same-sex relationship with another student and is extorted by a geek looking to date Simon's friend (Alexandra Shipp). As he goes about introducing his gauche blackmailer to his friends' circle, Simon also struggles to find a way to tell his parents (Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel) of his sexual orientation, and to discover his online pen pal's true identity. While its heart's in the right place with convincing performances and great insight into the challenges of gay youth, this coming-of-age coming-out comedy based on the YA novel comes off as corny and naïvely optimistic.Moreover, if we ban homosexuality in school there would be no more English literature classes.

That said, ""Love, Simon"" is a charming, smart, plausible and just a great feel movie all around. Script was amazing, directing was great, acting was superb - you basically can not find a flaw in this movie simply because it feels great and has a heart in a right place.Overall, ""Love, Simon"" is just a great little classic. It has a heart and will definitely leave kinda smiling. Great movie all around.","Love, Simon"
17,cruise01,Great lovable coming of age film.,9,22 June 2018,"Love, Simon (4.5 out of 5 stars).Love, Simon is a romantic teen film about a high school kid Simon (Nick Robinson) who is coming out of the closet on being gay. But is afraid to announce the news. Finds out there is another student in school that is gay too. And they begin a friendship through emailing each other. But when another student snaps pictures of there emails and blackmails Simon that he will publicly reveal their identities in school unless he can arrange a relationship with one of his lady friends. It is a cute, charming, fun teen film. I mean it is definitely one of those cheery good movies. It is a coming of age story. A teen coming out that he is gay. Having trouble trying to find another gay kid in high school. But feels odd that straight people never have to announce to their parents about there sexuality. But feels obligated when he has too. Sure, he has supportive parents played by Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner. Which they are even supportive that he goes out partying and even gets drunk, as long he is not behind the wheel. Plus his supportive friends played by Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. Which they do everything together that any normal teen would do like hang out at a waffle house during late hours, drink iced coffee, and doing anything spontaneous. The film is a lot of fun. Might as well be this modern generation John Hughes type of movie. A coming of age tale, high school drama, and a fun filled soundtrack. The cast was great. Nick Robinson was great playing a lovable character, which feels like he is sometimes lost. But not sure why, when he has a family that he loves and friends that are always there for him. Besides the films predictableness with the plot and knowing that everything will be okay in the end. The film was cute and good. Overall, Love, Simon is a good teen comedy drama with a great story. Sure, it should encourage many people out there to be themselves and never be afraid on being who they are. There are judgmental people and bullies but a person should never stop being who they are cause they are afraid. The cast was great. And the soundtrack was perfect. This film is definitely worth checking out.","Love, Simon"
18,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,7,20 April 2020,"Love Simon was a feel good movie. Loved the pop refrences and how the main character matured through his experience. The movie was overall nicely paced, with sweet friendship dynamics and an interesting main character that didn't overdo it and kept things real. So, for a teenage movie, this one was probably one of the best they have produced the last couple of years.","Love, Simon"
19,TheMovieDiorama,"Love, Simon delightfully encapsulates the struggles and benefits of ""coming out"".",9,25 April 2018,"To start with, yes I am gay. Does everyone know? No, they don't. I will do my very best to not make this review personal and solely focus on the film itself. Simon is an average teenager in high school who leads a normal life, except he has one big secret...he is gay. He confides in an anonymous individual, simply known as ""Blue"", to which he attempts to decipher the real identity of this mysterious entity that he has fallen in love with. This film...I don't know what it's done to me, but it has changed me. Rarely do I walk out of a cinema experience and feel enlightened to actively want to change myself for the better. There are a numerous number of factors to this. The excellent natural character development that differentiates each other to create memorable personalities. The witty humorous screenplay that intelligently balances the emotional heartache with a light tone of warmth and tenderness. The charismatic acting, particularly from Robinson, that conveys the complicated feelings and the internal battle for wanting to ""come out"". The excessive bubbly narrative tone that resembles the high school environment that is being portrayed. All of the above represent colourful components to a gay rainbow that is an incarnation of the word: relatable. I cannot begin to fathom how rare it is to find a film that illustrated my life. Love, Simon did just that. I saw myself in a myriad of characters, that's enough reasoning to prove how thorough the character development was. I teared up twice and the ""coming out"" scene to his parents tore my heart into tiny pieces. Sure, it slightly leans towards the fluffy side of teen drama where it detracts from some more emotional moments. Yet I find myself compelled to inform you that this film is an important step for cinema. A mainstream Hollywood drama dealing with the agonising process of ""coming out"". How many of them can you say you've seen? I smiled, laughed, teared and sympathised. Now if you'll excuse me I've got some wrongs to right in my life.","Love, Simon"
20,matthewssilverhammer,"Not Sure I LOVE Simon, But I Definitely Like Him",7,22 March 2018,"""You get to exhale now, Simon."" Our protagonist, a closeted gay teenager, spends his story learning that he's as worthy to live as anyone else. This humanizing of the LGBT community is the soul of Love, Simon. So not only is the movie funny, romantic and emotional, it's vital. Underneath it's occasionally cliched tendencies, it's a heartfelt and lovingly made love story that allows a complex, confusing and invigorating part of life be just that: complex, confusing and invigorating. 
Love, Simon would be forgiven if, like so many other coming-out films, it was an ultra-depressing melodrama. However, it takes a different approach. Sure, there are brief moments of blatant bigotry, a couple of beautiful parent-reaction scenes, and some hilarious over-compensation by ""woke"" supporters. However, this story takes place in the modern world, in which homosexuality isn't nearly as taboo as it was even just a couple years ago. So instead of the big, obvious fears that kids who come out face (social rejection, familial disappointment, etc), it gets into the real dirt. Will my friends see to me differently? Will my identity be solely wrapped up in who I'm attracted to? Can I control other's perceptions of me?
That tendency for honest authenticity are the film's strengths. It makes it all the more frustrating that the crux of the plot revolves around a side-character who is neither honest nor authentic, but purely a device for pushing a predictable and unnecessary plot along. It's such distractingly poor writing, a lesser film would've broken under its contrived weight. But Love, Simon's strengths of big-heart and familiar humor completely win out, giving us the best Hollywood-high-school flick since Clueless.","Love, Simon"
21,lisafordeay,Very good movie with a surprising twist to it,9,8 April 2018,"Love Simon is directed by the man that brought us Life As We Know It Greg Blantami and tells the story about a young teenager named Simon Spier(Nick Robinson) who lives with his mom and dad(Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhmel) along with his younger sister. Despite the fact he leads a normal life, he of course is hiding a secret about his sexuality... he is gay. Problems arise however when Simon strikes a relationship with a guy online called ""Blue"" and of course a guy called Martin wants to blackmail Simon over it so he can date Abby.Question though is will Simon's secret be exposed and will he ever meet his online crush Blue.Overall this movie actually shocked me so much. I thought it was a very good coming of age film all about a guys struggle with his identity.
It also has this John Hughes vibe to it. Jennifer and Josh were excellent as the parents of Simon and the guy acting as Simon was excellent.Please don't get disgusted by this film as I am sure there will be alot of hate but I really loved it as I myself have gay friends,plus I stand for the LGBTQ .

22,jtindahouse,Wonderful characters drive a strong story,8,22 September 2019,"The biggest strength that 'Love, Simon' possesses is its characters. So much care and effort has gone into each and every one of them. There are no throwaway characters simply put there to advance the plot. Each serves a purpose, yet each also contains a soul. It makes for wonderful viewing. Every scene is filled with so much depth and purity because of it. Films like this are a pleasure to watch.I also loved the mystery element to the film. I had never read the book (in fact didn't even know this was based on a book until after seeing it) so I got the thrill of genuinely experiencing the mystery as the film went along. In an already very strong movie this was a nice icing on the cake.The film's conscience isn't always what I'd like it to be. Sometimes characters do things and get off too lightly, and other times characters do things and get punished too severely. I guess this is probably true to the real world, but in the movie world it is often nice for people to the get the justice they deserve, one way or the other. Otherwise though this is a very hard film to fault. A great cast, playing great characters, in a great story. What more could you ask for?","Love, Simon"
23,Turfseer,"Despite overly idyllic world view, this gay coming of age tale is vastly entertaining",7,31 March 2018,"If straight people can have polished, witty, rom coms, why can't gays? And now with Love, Simon, they do! No matter that most rom coms present a rather idyllic picture of the world, preferring to look at the world with the glass half full, opposed to the glass half empty. What's missing of course is the deeper level of complexity with characters that might be a tad bit more multi-dimensional-traits suggesting a darker side and the attendant machinations that come with such a view. Nonetheless, there's nothing wrong with unbridled optimism, and Love, Simon delivers unsparingly-a tour de force that entertains to a surprising denouement that doesn't disappoint.Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) is a closeted gay teenager living in an Atlanta suburb with two liberal parents and his younger sister. While the mother is completely accepting (a psychotherapist of course), the characterization of Simon's Dad is more subtle. After Simon ultimately comes out, the father, despite his outright displays of liberalism, realizes he's uncomfortable with the idea of his son being gay, and in a highly effective emotional scene must seek forgiveness for the hostility that he realizes has been simmering for quite some time, just below the surface.The supporting players, Simon's three buddies, Leah and Nick (long-term childhood friends) and a newcomer Abby, fit seamlessly into the plot as Simon must avoid emotional entanglements with the females due to his particular sexual orientation and ensure in the end that his friends maintain their equilibrium in their relationships with one another.Leah has been secretly pining away for Simon but of course she's unaware that he's gay. Meanwhile, Simon believes Leah has a crush on Nick who would like to hook up with Leah but is hopelessly shy. The break into the second act comes about when Martin (a fellow thespian, in the student production of ""Cabaret"") blackmails Simon after discovering his emails to the incognito gay student (who goes by the online moniker of ""Blue""). It seems Martin is hopelessly smitten by Abby and wants Simon to act as the intermediary, assisting him in romancing her.In addition to these interesting machinations, there's the overall mystery as to Blue's identity. When Simon and Leah show up at a Halloween costume party (dressed so cool as John Lennon and Yoko Ono), they run into Bram, a black Jewish kid dressed as Barack Obama (Bram has the funniest bit in the entire movie-telling Simon and Leah that he's come as ""Post-election"" Obama, enjoying Mai Tais on the beach in Hawaii and ensuring that his legacy isn't spoiled by the current occupant of the White House). Simon's belief that Bram is Blue is shattered, when, looking for the bathroom, accidentally discovers Bram making out with a girl in a bedroom.Simon experiences his dark moment of the 2nd Act when he's ""outed"" by Martin, who releases all of Simon's emails to the anonymous Blue, on social media. Subsequently, Simon temporarily loses his friends when Abby discovers that he's been trying to manipulate her into dating Martin. Interestingly enough there are parallels between Simon and Martin and their behavior. Both make poor choices under stress. In Simon's case, it's the blackmailing by Martin that forces Simon to try and help his misguided fellow student and lie to his friends. And it's Martin's humiliation at the football game where he expresses his love for Abby and is rejected by her, that leads him to release Simon's emails.The plot leads to a fitful conclusion as another ""Blue"" possibility is revealed. Lyle, the waiter at the greasy spoon, is soon eliminated as a candidate, as he turns out to have a crush on Abby. Simon and another gay student, Ethan, end up bonding after they're subject to taunts by two anti-gay students, in the school cafeteria. As with everything in this film, all's well that ends well, when the all-knowing drama teacher (a sassy black woman) stops the gay bashers in their tracks and ensures they end up in the dean's office. It's there that they apologize to Simon and Ethan (in real life, things might not have ended up so winningly!).The theme of redemption becomes apparent as Leah arranges for a reconciliation between Simon and Nick and Abby (who are now a couple). Even Martin is offered a measure of forgiveness (by the film's scenarists), when (in an act of mea culpa) offers to purchase the final ticket on the ferris wheel for Simon, where Blue's identity is finally revealed.The happy ending of course is wonderfully optimistic but a little too idyllic to qualify for a more complex look at gay life. Perhaps what is needed is Love, Simon, the sequel. Is there a new Tennessee Williams on the horizon? With this incarnation however, simply be prepared to be vastly entertained-a difficult accomplishment these days considering the dearth of truly witty and compelling screenplays.","Love, Simon"
24,jadavix,Pretty good,7,18 December 2018,"""Love, Simon"" is well made and, especially, well acted, with some funny lines of dialogue.It just doesn't really excel in any particular area. It's not noteworthy enough.The story is about a teenage boy who comes from a picture-perfect family (his parents are Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel, for chrissake) and is blessed with some too-good-to-be-true friends, none of whom are believable as teenagers. They don't seem to have an immature moment.The protagonist's secret is that he is gay. A bigger secret might be: why keep this a secret? The only homophobes in the movie are regarded by everyone as idiots. Simon's parents are obviously not going to mind. His friends are like youthful middle-aged college professors and hence, not going to care either.Nick Robinson should be tomorrow's next star. Hopefully he will graduate to adult roles soon, and something more challenging than ""Love, Simon"" or ""Jurasssic World"".","Love, Simon"

27,pixrox1,"This flick is intended as a Real ""Message"" Movie . . .",8,20 March 2018,". . . as the LOVE, SIMON filmmakers lobby for some fundamental changes in the way American children are reared. The vast majority of U.S. kids born since 1970 have proudly declared themselves to be LGB or T by the beginning of First Grade (that is, Age 6), or sheepishly confessed to being only Straight. However, LOVE, SIMON focuses upon the hypothetical outliers: High School seniors who are still concealing their sexual orientation in our Modern Times 21st Century America of Today (!!). As this story progresses, this kind of Twentieth Century Foxy subterfuge lends itself to blackmail, extortion, and worse. Simon comes awfully close to entirely ruining the lives of his three best friends--Leah, Nick, and Abbie--because he's been so selfish, Wishy-Washy, and spineless in hiding his True Colors from family and should-be intimates. (This, of course, is why FBI agents and U.S. presidents are not allowed to obfuscate about such essential basics; a recent poll found that 63% of Americans believe ""Exxon Rex's"" boss--the famous ""First Moron""--is in bed with ""Simon"" when it comes to public denial, resulting in his obvious on-going blackmailing, as well as the decades of outrageously ludicrous excessive cover-up behavior in the opposite direction.) LOVE, SIMON uses the play CABARET as its connection back to the Dark Days of the 1900s. (The film version of CABARET, of course, was shamefully denied the ""Best Picture"" Oscar because its main Nazi Thug character slept with BOTH the main guy character AND the main gal character!) About 46 1/2 minutes into LOVE, SIMON the producers include a montage of what the compulsory Sexual Orientation Declarations could look like. The sooner these can be legally implemented, the better.","Love, Simon"

The message in this film is clear - just because you are gay doesn't make you an outcast. I'm glad this was made clear. Thank you Director: Greg Berlanti & Writer: Elizabeth Berger.But I wish they had taken the step further to explain the roots of this hate, this disenfranchisement of gay people. That root is religion! And this is preached from the pulpit every Sunday. Simon didn't feel excluded because was different; he felt excluded because he was scared!! He was scared because he feared the judgement of others. And to judge others is what is taught in religion - which is a blatant contradiction in the message or rather the word.As a film 'Love, Simon' is too long and the ending mostly predictable.

35,jadepietro,A Coming Out Story that Entertains Rather than Enlightens,7,21 March 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An entertaining ""coming out"" of age film that rarely exceeds its sit-com trappings.JIM'S REVIEW: Today we are said to live in a bubble, a parallel universe that protects us from real events. Love, Simon is that place. It purports to be a real world totally accepting of LGBT rights and bereft of any menacing prejudice. People there have a high tolerance of diversity issues too. Would that this world be just a tad like the characters and place in this entertaining comedy! But it's not...and that is the main problem I had with this loving but dishonest story.First, let me vent: We are dealing with major problems of hate crimes, gay conversion therapy, and the stripping away of human rights in our real world. None of those obstacles exist here. This is pure sit-com land, without a laugh track but with a wink and a nod to John Hughes' popular teenage comedies in the 80's. However, the main character has now transgendered into the Molly Ringwald hero this time around. One may say that I am being overly sensitive to the subject...it's a COMEDY, one that gives today's generation of gay teenagers (and yes, they do exist) a big OK to be who you are. You may say get over it! And I guess that having this film produced and distributed by a major studio is definitely a step forward. I just wish it took more chances.That said, I do not want to be too hard on this film. Love, Simon is an extremely good movie, earnest in its intentions but more unexceptional in its execution. It has much to say, even if it delivers its message far too subtly. That message of tolerance and self-worth can be clearly heard and may be the most important statement about this ""coming out"" of age tale.We are introduced to a likable title character who lives in an affluent suburbia community. Simon has known that he is gay for a long time, but he is leery about sharing that secret with his parents and friends, fearing any negative reaction. He is in search of love and he decides to find it, anyway possible, including contacting an anonymous online lover named Blue. This invisible gay character becomes a bit of a mystery for Simon and the moviegoing audience as well as Simon fantasizes some of his teenage friends and acquaintances in that role.The screenplay by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker (adapted from Becky Albertalli's Simon vs. the Homo Sapien Agenda) has many clever moments, turning the tables on our perceived biases. We empathizes with Simon through his many well-written confessional voiceovers which define his confused state of mind. The script establishes its stock characters (the loyal girlfriend, the funny sidekick, the hunky friend, the drama club type, etc.) and gives them some unexpected quirkiness that diverts our interest. But it lacks the courage to delve into a real gay relationship with any new insight.The film is solidly directed by Greg Berlanti for mass audience appeal. Too bad he homogenizes the gay conquest angle, barely registering even a simple kiss, let alone any more graphic sexual awakening scene. Rest assure, love will be found In this sanitized PG -13 version with a simple tender kiss being the only sexual affirmation given to Simon and mainstream teenage audiences. Nevertheless, it is all innocuous diverting fun, mostly due to its engaging cast.Nick Robinson plays Simon and he is a delight. The actor elevates the story with his sincere and touching interpretation of a boy trying to find himself. He brings with him the perfect charm and charisma needed to make this story work. Many fine young actors complete the teenage cast, although they all seem more twenty-somethings than real teenagers. This winning ensemble include Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Logan Miller, Kelynan Lonsdale, Clark Moore, and Jorge Lendeborg, Jr., and all do a commendable job. The adults in the cast are left at the perimeters of the teenage angst in sketchy roles, but Tony Hale and especially Natasha Rothwell add that needed comic spark with their ironic comments and sharp comic timing. Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel play Simon's caring parents and deliver their tender familial moments very well.Love, Simon is a most assuredly a crowdpleaser, but it is more Like, Simon for this reviewer.","Love, Simon"
36,rgkarim,Loved This Film,8,18 March 2018,"In today's world, being yourself is a difficult thing to achieve. With the explosion of the Internet, and the anonymity of it, people choose to judge, share, and tear down their fellow human beings. So, this super sensitive population searches for any means to express themselves, perhaps inspiration to stand up to the standard of normal in hopes of being respected. This brings me to the movie of this review Love Simon, a story about a homosexual male trying to find his place in his world. Based on another teenage novel, Hollywood presents another cultural phenomenon to sell this weekend. Robbie K is back with another review to let you know how it was! Let's get Started: LIKES:Acting: This weekend was a phenomenal one for acting in movies and Nick Robinson, plays the titular character to the letter. The lead role required a lot of poise and focus to adequately transition between the various hats Simon had to wear, and Robinson executes these components flawlessly. Fired up when needed, but calm at other times, Robinson made the hormone inclined Simon a character I could stand instead of one that forced me to bite my lip to stay quiet. His supporting cast mates also craft their characters to entertaining and engaging levels, mixing well with Simon's drama and keeping the emotional charged scenes in line. The chemistry of all the cast is impressive and helps make you feel part of a convoluted high school family. Entertaining: The performances help with this, but the entire film itself has a lot of fun elements to make things interesting and intriguing to watch. First of all, the pace of the movie is steady, moving quick enough to not grow dull, but not so rapid as to forego diving into the character development. Second the drama is relatable, which allows one to latch on to an issue and see how the issue will resolve. The third element is despite the melodramatic moments, the movie has plenty of comedic relief to keep you chuckling, from well-time lines that have that perfect humorous punch, to the slapstick clumsy antics of the nerds. By breaking up the drama, one doesn't feel as bogged down by the overhyped, teenage crises unfolding on the screen. And of course, the passion and feelings in this movie are by far the most engaging elements of this movie. Love Simon manages to keep everything in check, being dramatic when needed, but grounded to recharge. And as an honorable mention, the mystery of who Blue is also brings some added fun to the mix, no matter how predictable it may be. The Plot Morals: Love Simon has plenty of ethical dilemmas to tease your conscience with. Social identity, coming out of the closet, being yourself, friend and family love, the trials of trust, social media dependence, bullying, and so much more lie in this film. The writers/directors accomplished the goal of bringing these terrifying scenarios out into full light, properly designing the scenes and sequences to have as many aspects possible to describe the dilemmas. It's a great food for thought movie that parents can use to illustrate the wrongs and rights of life to the their teenagers, with resolutions that are decently realistic, and often satisfying to watch. An even bigger achievement, is how connectable some of these moments can feel primarily in seeing a parent reaching out to help or to a peer putting an end to bullying by bluntly expressing that internal thought we always wanted to say. All these value-studying scenarios deserve an applause and are the established heart of the movie, outside of the romance tale contained within. DISLIKES: The Family: Simon's family has an impressive cast to bring them to life, but for me... they felt a little disjointed and uninvolved in the movie compared to everyone else. Certainly, they come in when it counts most, but aside from these moments, the small cast seems to be in the background more than anything. As telling your family is a big deal, I had expected more involvement and turmoil with the group, but no, they are rather passive and in the case of the dad, a nimrod who only brings mediocre jokes at the best. Predictable: As well delivered and clever as this movie was, Love Simon is also a rather predictable tale to say the least. The plot elements are tired, and the inevitable catastrophe of so many secrets coming to light is entirely unavoidable to say the least. One will be able to easily predict the failures arising well before they actually happen. Some of this is due to the trailers giving away things, but others are just lazy foreshadowing and copying from shows like DeGrassi or The Secret Life of the American Teenager. Even the main mystery of Blue's identity is easy to discern if you pay close enough attention to character use and themes of the movie. But if you get sucked up into the drama enough, you won't have to worry so much about this. The Lax Obstructions: Seeing how the modern era is to hound people on the Internet and bullies doing everything to torment their prey, I was surprised to see how lax these elements were in this film. Simon's worst enemy is anxiety and fear, these demons tugging at him hard enough to nearly split his mind in two. Yet in the physical world, the cyber bullying and teasing were at an all-time minimum, outside of two jerks who were lamer than threatening. While I applaud the avoidance of generating ideas of tormenting, I feel they missed the target on really driving home the life lessons they were shooting for, as well as adding a little more thrills to the mix. In addition, the attempt to deter people from sharing everything on social media was completely glazed over, sometime even promoting to speak up on the internet rather than avoid the cyber world altogether. The VERDICT:  This reviewer was very pleased with how well this teenage romance story came to life. A remarkable cast gave a stirring performance to help bring this engaging and entertaining story to new heights, helping to bring relatable topics to the light. And while there are still things to improve upon including better involvement of the family and antagonizing elements to spice things up, the movie kept a nice balance on things. While teenagers are certainly going to enjoy this the most, Love Simon is a moving feature older generations can appreciate as well. Therefore, I recommend visiting the theater on this one, to be quite honest. My scores are:Comedy/Drama/Romance: 8.5
Movie Overall: 7.5","Love, Simon"
37,invisibleunicornninja,This was beautiful.,10,26 March 2018,"I almost never cry over fictional characters, but I was crying by the time this movie was over. Everyone else in the theater was crying as well. There were like 6 other people though. (I saw it in the theater on a Monday afternoon after it had already been out for like a month of course the theater was empty.)Plot - This story is a bit cliche. There are a few beats that all movies like this have to hit, but for the most part the cliche scenes served a part to the story. The script probably could've used some fine-tuning. The overall story is very beautiful and effective, but it probably could've been a lot better. The central conflict is jumpstarted by Simon not understanding how to log off of a computer. I know that's how it happened in the book, but its still kinda dumb. Characters - Most of the characters are simplistic cliches, but they serve their roles. Though I did grow attached to Simon very quickly, he does stand out as the only character with any kind of depth or internal struggle. Yes, he's the main character, but a lot of the others had the potential to be better developed than they were.Sights and Sounds - If you are not a fan of pop music you will probably not last very long watching this movie. The cinematography for this movie is great. It does look a bit cheap, but it still looks nice. The Ending - I'm not going to say any spoilers, but the ending of this movie really redeems it. Up until that finale, the movie was fairly mediocre. The dialogue wasn't very good, and the plot wasn't very clever or original. I might be a bit biased as this movie actually made me cry (though I'd like to point out that movies almost never make me cry) but the ending is very good. I liked that Simon had to face the consequences of what he did. I do think that his friends overreacted, and I hate the character ""Martin,"" but it was still very effective. Product Placement - This doesn't have anything to do with the movie, I just wanted to point it out. There is a bit of super obvious product placement in this movie. It doesn't have anything to do with anything, but I just found it a bit funny. Hang on, I suddenly feel the urge to buy some sweet Nike sneakers.Overall, this movie isn't that great, but the Ferris wheel scene really makes the whole thing. This movie is important and entertaining. I was sobbing tears of joy as I left that theater. This movie is worth watching, and I highly recommend it. Finally a message to my fellow gays - ""I like your boots.""","Love, Simon"
38,arungeorge13,A comedy drama with a gay protagonist that really hits the mark! [+76%],8,1 November 2020,"Love, Simon is a highly relevant movie for the present times and beyond. It has neatly etched characters, emotionally resonating performances, great humor, and oodles of feel-good vibes. Nick Robinson (who looks astonishingly similar to Ansel Elgort) comes up with a solid feat, ably supported by Josh Duhamel, Jennifer Garner, Katherine Langford, Alexandra Shipp, Logan Miller, Keiynan Lonsdale,and the rest of the ensemble. The plot plays out rather predictably, with its poignant highs and lows, but the pacing, the soundtrack, and the writing bring it to greater heights. The coming-out scenes (i.e the core of the film) are so well executed, especially the one with Robinson and Garner.","Love, Simon"
39,rivertam26,Truly one of the best films of it's kind,10,23 February 2020,"At this point I've seen this movie about 12 times and it's just amazing. Being a gay man myself I never thought I'd see a mainstream release like this in my lifetime. I remember the first couple times I saw this the film audience went bonkers clapping and I was just in tears. Yes I'm kind of a wuss but this story feels so personal to me and to see a realistic, positive representation still blows me away. Especially since the film was a modest hit and more films haven't been made. The movie centers on a young man named Simon played by an impressive Nick Robertson who's outed by a jerk off classmate and has to deal with the repacutions including the fellow student he's mysteriously been messaging with. It ranks up there with the best of John Hughes. Its genuine, heartfelt and engaging. Truly one of the best films of its kind ever made.","Love, Simon"

41,proud_luddite,A good modern update of rom-coms and LGBT stories,7,24 April 2018,"Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) is a teenage boy living in a pleasant Atlanta suburb. While his life is ideal in many ways, he struggles with a secret: he's gay. His stifled feelings are expressed in an online correspondence with an anonymous teenage boy who attends the same high school.""Love, Simon"" is a very modern update of past feel-good rom-com films. The update is not only the gay twist but the fact that there is far less tragedy than gay stories of the past. Homophobia is present but far less powerful and dangerous than it is in other films. There is another element that is very pleasing: people of different racial backgrounds mix easily in a matter-of-fact way.Another way this film is very modern is in the way that much of the connection among people is online - much like in real life. (Earlier stories would have used pen-pals and personal ads - a situation that would be considered quaint by today's standards or whatever word would substitute the word 'quaint' which is as outdated as personal ads and pen pals.)The narrative of ""Love, Simon"" includes an unnecessary - and sometimes annoying - blackmail element. This could have been eliminated though it does lead to some very moving, heartfelt scenes in the later segments. These scenes allow the actors to show their best.It might be fair to criticize the film for being overly simplistic and idealistic. But to have a pleasant story in which none of the gay characters is obligated to be dead, tortured, beaten, humiliated, or ostracized by the end, this strangely comes off as bold compared to earlier films in this genre. There is also a fun, lively energy created by director/writer Greg Berlanti especially in comical relief from characters such as the high school's principal and drama teacher.An enjoyable experience.","Love, Simon"

43,bettycjung,Coming of age and coming out can be one complicated process,8,23 June 2018,"6/21/18. I rarely give 8 stars for a teen rom-com, but this one is different. Aside from being about a closeted gay teen in the throes of teenage-angst, it is more about a teen being in love. It just so happens that it's a boy in love with another boy he has never seen but developed feelings for from texting and getting to know one another. So, for most of the film, Simon is trying to figure out just who ""Blue"" is, and suffers daily devastations as he is faced with disappointments. And, so much sadness when the viewer discovers his best gal pal is totally in love with Simon! And, what a great soundtrack to go along with a watch-worthy movie of a boy who comes of age while at the same time comes out with mix results.A movie with a lot of heart and soul.","Love, Simon"
44,rockman182,"Love, Simon (2018)",7,21 March 2018,"Been hearing some good things about this film. Trailer did peak my interest. Nick Robinson is certainly a rising star today as I'm starting to see him get leading roles after appearing in Jurassic World. This actually might be the first coming of age film based on a gay teenager and his romance. Therefore, I had to see if it would live up to the quick hype that was built up for this. I'd say its a very solid film that handles its characters, plots, and humor quite well.Simon is a seemingly regular teenager (as narrated by himself) but he has a giant secret that he is hiding. He is actually gay and struggling to come out to his family and friends. He befriends an anonymous gay teenager from his school, through email. A fellow classmate finds out that Simon is gay and thus starts blackmailing Simon for favors. Simon must decide whether he wants to come out or give in to the demands to keep his life the way its been.The humor in this film is present but never overbearing. As mentioned earlier the film balances themes quite well. Its a strong likable performance all around from Nick Robinson. You are swept along on the trip of trying to find out who the other boy that Simon is chatting too, really is. I kept reading people comparing it to the John Hughes films of the 80's and I do agree to a sense in the feel of the film but I think its also just a well made current teenage film. Its not overly unique, but I do feel like it has its own stamp.My only gripes with the film is that it does feel quite long and near the end you can feel the wear of it. Still, I think all involved in this project could be proud of the outcome. Judging by the early reception for the film, I can see it becoming a bit of a cult classic especially for its LGBTQ theme and use of diversity. Its a fun and safe time despite having to deal with big issues.7/10","Love, Simon"
45,jon.h.ochiai,"I love ""Love, Simon""",10,19 March 2018,"The beauty and poignancy of ""Love, Simon"" is that what makes it so revolutionary may no longer be someday. Nick Robinson is vulnerable and authentic as 17 year-old Simon, who comes out as gay. In Director Greg Berlanti's ""Love, Simon"" someone hostages Simon's choice. He screams in anger, ""It's supposed to be my thing!"" Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker of ""This is Us"" wrote the eloquently whimsical screenplay based on Becky Albertalli's ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"". Perhaps, Berger and Aptaker's story falters a little in contrivance seemingly forcing Simon's ""outing"". Yet, Berlanti and Robinson convey its touching humanity.Nick's Simon powerfully declares, ""... I'm still me."" He gets to take a deep breath again. Simon gets to just be. Later his Mom Emily, played by compassionately wise Jennifer Garner tells her son, ""You get to exhale now, Simon."" She sensed that her Simon was 'holding his breath' for these last few years, that he suffered.""Love, Simon"" touches all of us within. I saw the movie in the theater with many teens and young adults in attendance. At the arc of the love story, everyone including me applauded. Everyone. ""Love, Simon"" distinguishes as the first major studio release about teen gay love story. The movie resonates far beyond just that. ""Love, Simon"" is about the possibility of falling in love, and being free to be who you are. Maybe ""Love, Simon"" rounds its narrative edges incorporated in the crisp witty dialogue and commentary. Yet, ""Simon"" endears your heart with its sense of decency and generous respect of people. ""Love, Simon"" opens as Simon describes the stasis of his life. Life is good, normal for the most part. He loves his family. Mom, played by Garner, is the successful clinician. She was the high school valedictorian, who married the Captain of the football team his Dad Jack, played by strong gentle Josh Duhamel, who discovered greater after football. Simon is supportive of his creative younger sister Nora, cute not too precocious Talitha Bateman, who dreams of becoming the next Celebrity TV Chef. Simon confesses to a big secret. When he gazes at the strapping young male landscaper, we get it. Simon hangs with his core friends in Leah, Nick, and Abby played by Katherine Langford, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., and Alexandra Shipp, who are all amazing. Life goes on with their morning ice coffee runs. Then one day, Leah, who holds a torch for Simon, tells him that one of their classmates came out as gay on an Internet site. He goes by the name Blue. Curious, Simon contacts Blue to let him know that he is not alone. Simon falls in love with Blue in their email exchanges. One of Berger and Aptaker's conceits becomes the detective story to uncover Blue's identity. Along the way predictable conflict arises when fellow drama student Martin, played by callous socially crippled Logan Miller, spies Simon's email to Blue. He blackmails Simon to get him with Abby or else he will reveal the intimate email. Simon is barely discovering who he is. Now some jerk victimizes him for discovering what makes him happy, for risking falling in love. ""Love, Simon"" is masterful in understatement. Although the narrative veers contrived at times, we experience Simon's life: both the suffering and joy. The movie wisely focuses on Simon's school life. Yet, the moments with his parents are amazing. Too bad Garner and Duhamel don't leverage more screen time. They are awesome. Robinson is the star of ""Love, Simon"". He is the brightness of humanity in the darkness of prejudice. Our hearts break in Simon's betrayal. And they soar with his joy. Simon says, ""I'm still me."" ""Love, Simon"" also says, ""I'm free to be me."" Now that is a world we all deserve to live in. I love ""Love, Simon"".","Love, Simon"
46,RforFilm,"Love, Simon tackles a hard issue about a popular teenager being gay and does it with honesty and sweetness.",8,16 March 2018,"The news has been filled with constant reminders with how much people seem to be more divided thanks to the more controversial political landscape. People will disagree about a lot of things, but I think back to my high school era and have to consider whether were holding back a lot more then we consider. Being a part of the musical theater group of kids, I would come to know several people that were a part of the LBGT minority. Some of them were reserved and some were ""loud and proud"" I thought it was interesting to consider that maybe twenty-five years ago, they would have not been as confortable doing so.Because of this landscape, I have grown up with no problems with the LBGT crowd. I have lived by the philosophy that no matter what kind of person you were, as long as you were good, then you had the right to be whoever you wanted. I just wished that cinema had done better to portray the LBGT community, especially in high school movies, where it would matter the most. This movie does portray things differently as it should with Love, Simon.High school senior Simon Spier (played by Nick Robinson) seems to have his life in control. He has plenty of friends including Leah (played by Katherine Langford), Abby (played by Alexandra Shipp) and Nick (played by Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) that share classes and hang out. He has a supporting family he loves including dad Jack (played by Josh Duhamel), mom Emily (played by Jennifer Garner) and sister Nora. He's happy as a musical theater student, even if he's playing bit parts. While everyone sees Simon as a likable classmate, what they don't know is that he's gay.Everything changes for him when while scrolling through a local Whisper-like webpage, someone within his school reveals that their also gay. Simon finds his email and starts to vent out his personal frustrations and even tells the recipient ""Blue"" that he's been struggling to come out of the closet. Both agree to email each other as ""Blue"" and Simon as ""Jacques"". At one point, classmate Martin (played by Logan Miller) finds his emails and promises not to reveal them in exchange for Simon helping him talk to Abby. He tries to get them together while telling another friend to go for another girl while trying to figure out who ""Blue"" is, his life just got more complicated.As I said, Love, Simon takes the ""gay kid in high school"" and does something different. Most high school movies usually portray them as ""loud and proud"" or ""aggressive with a secret"". Instead, our gay character seems to be more popular who has to reveal his secret. This is something I haven't seen before, and this movie does it well. It works as a high school, coming of age, and as a romance (though loosely, though I'll get to that in a moment) movie. Not only are Nick Robinson and the other teenagers good actors, but they portray teenagers that I feel like I could see chatting in a Starbucks or sitting in the quad just hanging out. The writing does a good job fleshing out Simon as kind of quiet guy that could attract a group of people. I don't know why movies haven't done this, but I also like that he's not on a sports team or even a strong academic. He's just a kid. Later in the movie, his mother tells him about how he seems to be holding something inside. I got that too just from watching this movie. When you can sense one's budding pressure, you know your character is strong.As far as how this movie handles his coming out, I won't give that away as it's different then you'd expect this story to believe. I will say that how people receive it does feel genuine...especially with how they hear the news. If I had any problems, there are two. First is the blackmailing character Martin. Though I can see what kind of kid he's supposed to be, the smart-alec geek, he felt like he should belong in a 1980's National Lampoon comedy and not a modern drama. Second is the end result of Simon's love life, which I wont spoil, but I wish he could have ended up with someone else. What I don't want Love, Simon to portray is that like straight people, not all gay people are going to be attracted to each other. I'll give this eight Cabaret posters out of ten. I hope a lot of teenagers do get a chance to see this, especially if their in the LBGT crowd. They need to understand that coming out can be scary, but even with the occasional jerk, there are good people ready to give them a hug. Love, Simon is a sweet and honest look at this teenage dilemma that Hollywood had been uneasy about telling for a while.","Love, Simon"
47,dave-mcclain,a love story which trascends sexual identity,9,19 March 2018,"""Love, Simon"" (PG-13, 1:50) is a romantic comedy-drama directed by Greg Berlanti and written by Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, based on the award-winning 2015 YA novel ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" by first-time author Becky Albertalli. The story centers on a closeted gay teenage boy who has to juggle a variety of interpersonal drama related to his obsession with keeping his secret.Simon (Nick Robinson), as his voiceover at the beginning of the film tells us, has a ""perfectly normal life""... except for that one big secret. He has loving parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) and a little sister (Talitha Bateman) whom he actually likes. Simon's closest friends (who ride with him to school every morning) are childhood friends Leah (Katherine Langford) and Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and, the newest member of the group, transfer student Abby (Alexandra Shipp). None of these people know Simon is gay and he wants to keep it that way... until he decides that he's ready to tell them. But external influences intrude. Simon sees a social media post by someone in his school who claims to be a closeted gay teenage boy at Simon's school, but doesn't identify himself by name, just referring to himself as ""Blue"". Blue's message includes a Gmail address, so Simon sets up a new account and begins corresponding with Blue, using the name ""Jacques"". As they encourage each other and cautiously begin sharing a few details about their personal lives, a socially awkward classmate named Martin (Logan Miller) learns about the Emails, makes copies of them and threatens to ""out"" Simon, unless Simon does something for him. Martin forces Simon to help him get together with Abby, which leads Simon to manipulate his closest friends, while hoping that Martin doesn't expose his secret and trying to figure out who Blue is. Simon has a lot of balls in the air and anyone can see they can't stay up there forever.""Love, Simon"" is an excellent romance which you don't have to be gay to enjoy. The main character isn't as tortured as those in ""Brokeback Mountain"" or ""Moonlight"", but not as carefree as those in ""Call Me By Your Name"". Simon is portrayed as happy and relatively well-adjusted, but is unsure about when or how to take the next step in being who he is. He's a good person who, unfortunately, gets off track and tries to solve his one big problem by acting selfishly. This movie's main point seems to be, as many people learn in their personal or professional (or political) lives, hiding the truth is usually more harmful than telling the truth. It's a lesson which rings true, as shown in the experiences of characters which feel genuine, in a movie that is entertaining and heartfelt. After all, regardless of sexual identity, as the film suggests, everyone deserves a great love story. And every cinematic love story deserves a script, a cast and a director as good as that of ""Love, Simon"". ""A""","Love, Simon"
48,bob-the-movie-man,Time to Exhale,7,14 March 2018,"Teen heartthrob Nick Robinson (the older brother from ""Jurassic World"") plays the eponymous hero who has a well-buried secret: he's gay. Growing up in Pleasantville (I almost expected someone to yell ""Cat!"" and the fire brigade turn up) he feels unable to come out to either his high-school friends or his loving family (""Apple pie cooling on the window-sill anyone?""). But striking up an email relationship with another closeted male from the same high school - nicknamed ""Blue"" - allows him to explore his feelings about his sexuality and fall in love all at the same time. But neither coming out or love run terribly smoothly for Simon...I am forty years adrift from being able to directly relate to the stresses and strains of modern high-school life (though I AM still 17 on the inside people!) But even to me, this film doesn't feel like it should be set in the present day. While it needs to be for its tweeting and blogging story-line, surely there are few backwaters in either America or Western Europe where gay people have to stay so silent? An 80's or early 90's setting would, I think, have worked so much better. (Ironically, its not his gay-ness or otherwise that his friends get upset by, but something far more fundamental in the human condition).That aside, this is a sweet and ultimately quite engaging film that I'm sure will be a big hit with a teenage audience. While for me it didn't come close to ticking all of the coming-of-age boxes that the inestimable ""Lady Bird"" did, it does cover old ground in a new and refreshing way, and I'm sure it WILL be very helpful for many gay people in getting the courage to come out. Times are different today, but I still can imagine few things requiring more bravery than declaring you are gay to your parents and closest friends (even though, deep down, they surely already suspect).So, it's sweet, but also for me (although far from its target audience) rather flat. As a comedy drama, the moments of comedy are few and far between, with only one or two of the lines making me chuckle rather than smile. A quiet auditorium is not a good sign for a film with ""Comedy"" in its imdb description. It does however occasionally break through with something memorable: a full on college ""La La Land"" scene (""Not that gay"" - LoL) is a case in point. And all of the scenes featuring comedy actress Natasha Rothwell as drama teacher Ms Allbright add much needed energy and humour to the film.Of the teen actors, Robinson is fine but it is Katherine Langford as Simon's friend Leah who stood out for me. Talitha Eliana Bateman (""The 5th Wave""; looking a whole lot younger than her 16 years!) is also impressive as Simon's culinary sister Nora. Simon's parents are played by Jennifer Garner (""Dallas Buyers Club"") and Josh Duhamel (a new one on me... he's been in the ""Transformers"" films apparently). The screenplay is by movie virgins Elizabeth Berger and Isaac Aptaker, and is a slightly patchy affair. There are scenes that worked well (a cringe inducing sports stadium scene for example) but other times where it seems to be trying too hard for T-shirt captions.... a line from Ethan (Clark Moore) about hate crime was a ""Ye-what?"" moment.Some of the characters really don't quite work either: Tony Hale (so memorable as the useless PA in ""Veep"") plays almost a school-ified version of Stephen Stucker's Johnny from ""Airplane"". Perhaps that would work as some sort of whacky hall monitor guy... but it transpires that he is the headmaster. No, I don't think so.So, in summary, after a bit of a bumpy start, its a pleasant watch that culminates in a feel-good ending. I can't see it getting a cinema release in Gambia or Nigeria, though God only knows they could use one. I was going to give this one 6*, but as I applaud both the theme its trying to promote and for bringing something fresh to the screen...(For the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

Why do some American film makers have to represent only the sweetest family's in the most palatial homes with kids going to great schools with the coolest friends and Teachers , life's not like that in many cases..A far far better teen coming of age movie and much more fun and realistic is the 1996 British movie A Beautiful Thing.It's good at last coming out as Gay is being portrayed in main stream cinema and my favourite scene in this Light weight romp was Jason asking why do only gay people have to experience this unique ""Coming Out"" process and then showed what if might be like ""Coming Out"" as heterosexual.

I was excited to see it from the very first trailer, and I cannot put into words how so far above and beyond my expectations that it went. The movie is absolutely brilliant. I couldn't stop laughing, unless I was crying. Please, please see it.We live in a day and age now where almost everyone can say they know someone who's gay. If you want to understand us, to understand our struggles and our pain, and what we go through, I implore you, please watch this movie. It will take you through all the ups and the downs, and it will give you an insight into the life experience of someone who grows up gay. It humanizes us, it makes us real, and it does so in a way that is light and funny, emotional when it needs to be, and isn't overbearing or pushy. It takes the issues we all struggle with as teenagers...and it shows you how those change when you add being gay on top of it.From the fear of being discovered, being willing to tell any lie, hurt anyone just to keep your secret, to the hope of that first attempt at flirting (which goes badly for LITERALLY everyone), and wondering if he's just being nice or if he's really into you. Finding out that first crush is into girls instead. The pain of the dead silence you get in response to the first time you say the words ""I'm gay"" to someone you love....and even the struggle to let that G word out of your mouth for the first time in someone else's company.I wish this had existed when I was that age. Maybe I wouldn't have been so terrified for so long of who I really was. Maybe I would have been able to find the humor, and the courage, to know that I would be okay long ago. But I am so incredibly proud to live in a society, 20 years later, where this film will get a wide theatrical release, and I hope it will be a hit. I hope it will inspire today's kids growing up gay to know that they are okay, they're normal, and they're going to be alright.","Love, Simon"

53,apryla-58795,Natasha Rothwell & Clark Moore nailed it!,5,20 November 2018,"I understand that this movie was based on a book which I did not read; so I can't comment on whether or not the film was true to the book BUT I'm here to tell you right now that this film is just not realistic. They had a real opportunity here and they just blew it.I'm not gay and I don't have any family members who are gay (that I know about) but through the years I have worked with many individuals who identified themselves as gay and pretty much ALL of them were great...hello? They're just people so why wouldn't they be? I didn't focus on their sexual persuasion. I didn't care about anything other than whether or not they were doing their job. If sexual stuff came up it was only cause they brought it up. I can't begin to understand their struggle or how someone deals with being outed BUT I do have a son and as his parent I got to observe him for many years while he was growing up. I also got to see him in numerous social situations as a family and also with his friends. I can't speak for everyone but in general teenagers either don't like or don't want to be around their parents and they usually can't stand their siblings. Also teens do everything possible to NOT stand out. They want to fit in so they don't do stuff like get on Ferris wheels and make out with someone who was just ""outed"" in front of a large amount of their peers. Nor do they cheerfully and willfully hang out with their families. But apparently in an alternate universe that's what kids do and it all works out perfectly.You know what was realistic? The two bullies that constantly were making fun of the one kid who was ""out"" already. That is how teenagers act. You'd like to think that's not the case anymore but sadly it is. I was pleased to see that they at least got that right because it sheds light on what some kids go through due to their sexual persuasion etc...we need to normalize this so it isn't an issue anymore. School is hard enough without adding bullying. No child should be committing suicide due to being made fun of for being straight or gay or whatever. School should be a safe place where there is zero tolerance for kids being bullied for being themselves - whatever it is they are or want to be.I really like Nick Robinson. He has been pretty solid in everything I've seen him in but this. He seemed mildly sedated and his performance was just kind of a dud. He did not bring anything particularly special to this role. We needed to really feel his struggle and he just didn't portray that well. He was just ""meh"".We have gotten so ridiculous with all the political correctness. Going overboard in trying to show how liberal the mom was - was just overkill. They went so far with it that the performances were boring and bland.When no one wants to offend anyone about anything you get a very one note performance. Because they showed this very white family living in a beautiful home with two perfect parents and children who always say and do the right thing - well people can't relate to that. It alienates them because very few people have all the things that this family had. Audiences need to feel the struggle and see some realness. We got none of that here. This kid had nothing to lose in a sense because he had nothing but love and support around him. There was no risk other than what he felt would change once he revealed who he liked.If they really wanted to portray the struggle that some kids go through they should've showed a kid from a single-parent household where the mother was largely absent due to having to work and when the father was involved he was a bigot and a bully. Also add to that if the kid wasn't as ""normal"" looking and acting as Nick Robinson's character was-maybe they had some type of disability or something about them that really stood out but not in a positive way that they would've already been made fun of for whether they were gay or not. That's a more realistic type of situation that kids are dealing with. It's not all perfect families where when the kid decides to come out he's got a bunch of support.You know who stole the show? Natasha Longwell and Clark Moore. She is on the HBO show Insecure and she is amazing! She makes me laugh so hard. She gave a perfect performance in this. Also Clark Moore looks like a mini-Madea. He was so funny but also gave a real heartfelt performance. Someone please get these two their own shows or even better-put them both on the same show. LOVE THEM!A few thoughts on some of the other actors...Tony Hale was really funny in some scenes. There's something about Logan Miller that keeps him from being amazing and I think it's his height. If he was taller I think he would be more imposing. He kind of reminds me a little bit of Christian Bale performance-wise. His small stature doesn't match his big personality so it's hard to see him as a ""contender"". Also I don't like that the writers let him get off so easily for doing what he did. His character was a terrible loser who blackmailed and outed an acquaintance with no repercussions. Then to make it worse they had him pop up at the Ferris Wheel at the end pulling a real douc*hy move and still no repercussions. Also that whole diner scene was so stupid. If that had really happened they would've been asked to leave. These filmmakers really try to push the bounds of reality to where it's not good or effectual it's just dumb and it leaves you rolling your eyes. Alexandra Shipp was very good. I predict we will be seeing a lot more of her. She's also very beautiful. Josh Duhamel was very boring in this. He is not known for his talent. He's usually reduced to being a pretty face but he did get me in the one scene where he cries. It was very emotional.I did like that one scene where the kids were ""coming out"" to their parents about being heterosexual. That was so great and it's what I've said all along - why is it news that people are gay? Why do they have to ""come out""? Why can't it just be what it is and everyone go about their day? ""You're gay? And...Anything else?"" I don't go around announcing I'm straight so I don't get the whole need to announce it thing. Moving on.Lastly here's the one big issue I had with the final scene. I hate that they went overkill with Blue. He's black, gay AND Jewish and they made sure that was made very clear just in case anyone thought they weren't checking off enough boxes. Again...who cares?! This isn't news but they were so obviously trying to pander to everyone that it was kind of laughable. Like seriously? It's actually insulting to treat it like being those things makes the person a ""unicorn"". Guess what?! There are straight black Jewish people and no one bats an eye at that. I mean c'mon! I can't believe they didn't have him roll up in a wheelchair just for good measure!This could have been great. It could've been the template for addressing students in school regarding this issue. They could've shown this and used it as a learning tool to open up a great way to discuss many things and not just being gay. But in the end it was liberal overkill filled with a lot of unnecessary political correctness to the point where it was trying to hard to be all things to all people and it ended up being another teen movie in a way and therefore very disappointing.I can't say I'd recommend this.","Love, Simon"
54,trinaboice,Coming out and coming of age,7,31 March 2018,"Grade: BRating: PG-13, 109 minutesIn a Nutshell: Nick Robinson stars as Simon Spier in this coming-of-age dramedy that shows how difficult it is for a teenager to ""come out"" and reveal who he really is to his friends and family. Add a mystery man and you get an unconventional love story that critics are calling fresh and romantic.Based on the popular book, the movie adaptation deals with a serious issue in a light-hearted way. I have a lot of LGBT friends and have tried hard to assure them that they are loved and accepted by me. Everyone deserves respect and kindness. Those who struggle with the same decisions that Simon does in this movie are praising the film for addressing a complicated social issue in a delicate way and giving it the Big Screen attention it deserves. 
Tips for parents: 
Within minutes of the movie starting, you hear crude language and carefree conversations about sex.
Profanity, crude language, and one F-bomb
A black transvestite and a gay boy get bullied.
Simon's high school puts on a musical performance of Cabaret. I remember when I was in high school and our theater director wanted to do that play. The parents and school district leaders told us to pick another play because they thought it was completely inappropriate and too mature for kids. What do YOU think?
Teens laugh at parents who don't know what the Grinder app is. (It's a hook-up app for gay men.)
It's a ""talking movie,"" so young kids might get bored.
The entire subject matter is mature, so parents need to decide at what age they want their children to be to see this. It certainly starts a conversation.Uplifting theme: 
Tolerance
""No matter what, announcing who you are to the world is pretty terrifying, because what if the world doesn't like you?"" - Simon - The truth is that we ALL face this same scary challenge, whether we're straight or gay.
Being brave enough to be who you really are.
Everyone is battling with their own secrets. Be gentle with yourself and with others.
Tolerance goes both ways.We're all on our own journey in life, so it's not helpful to judge or criticize others whose path or values are different from ours. (Some people will simply not want to watch or accept this movie and that's OK too.)  Things I liked:
SPOILER: Besides a few thug-head jocks in the school, everyone was really accepting of Simon. I thought Simon's mom was especially supportive and loving. There will always be haters, but we live in a more accepting world in many ways. I absolutely adored the recent movie The Greatest Showman, which also celebrated our differences and tried to show that everyone deserves to be loved.
One aspect of the movie that I haven't heard anyone else talk about is how friends and family actually WANT their loved one to come out to them. One of Simon's friends feels this way. I have known that a dear friend of mine is gay for many years, yet he has still not officially come out to me. He has told others, but not me. It actually hurts my feelings, because I absolutely adore him and accept him 100% for who he is. 
Teens will like the intrigue of trying to figure out who the mystery man/love interest is who chats with Simon online.
Nick Robinson does a really great job. He doesn't try to make us feel sorry for Simon, but only to relate to him. Simon explains, ""I'm just like you.""
There were some home décor things in Simon's house that I really liked, like the chalkboard walls around his bed, and the cozy kitchen benches.
I loved Leah's Papillion dog that she walked down the street, because I have one too!
I thought it was adorable that Nora (played by Talitha Bateman) was into cooking and that her family showed patience and love while she tried to develop her talent and figure out who she wanted to be too. Simon wasn't the only one changing. A good family is made up of imperfect people who show support while each one tries to stretch and grow. The family in this movie did exactly that.
Good soundtrack. Things I didn't like:
The antagonist is goofy and easily dismissed, despite the fact that he could have caused serious trauma or even a suicide.
Simon is very self-absorbed, like most teenagers, focusing solely on how his life will change when his big secret is revealed. He never thinks about what his family and friends might go through when he tells them. 
Lots of jean jackets. Ha ha
The teens drink a LOT of coffee.
I wish there were more focus on the romance and less on the sex.
Mr. Worth (ironic name, right?) was too much of a cartoon character.Funny lines:
""Stop with the Selfies. You're not all that."" - Mr. Worth (Tony Hale)
""I have something more important to say than the 'National Anthem.' No offense America."" = Martin (Logan Miller)Interesting lines:
""I'm just like you."" - Simon","Love, Simon"
55,CinematicInceptions,"This year's ""Get Out"".",8,22 January 2019,"This wasn't my personal favorite movie of 2018, but it might have been the best movie of 2018. I'm writing this the day before the Oscar nominations are announced because I don't think this will get any nominations, but in my opinion it should. I know it's basically just a high school movie, but Nick Robinson's performance was spot on and it had some of the most beautifully emotional moments of any movie I've seen. So for that, I think it deserves some kind of recognition.This is hardly the first movie to be centered around homosexuality, but for whatever reason it got more publicity than any other to date, at least among younger audiences. And it definitely stuck the landing, delivering a quality entertaining and emotional story in a genre that is synonymous with social stereotypes, annoying pop music, and sub-par writing.Even as a straight guy, I could relate to Simon more than most characters, certainly more than any other high school characters. This was where I think the story did a really good job, because it addressed themes that are universal beyond the LGBTQ+ community and acknowledged that Simon's insecurity about coming out wasn't just a ""gay thing"". It could have chosen to make the plot center around a lot of other issues that are prevalent in conversations about sexual orientation, but instead centers around the complications that arise with Simon's friends which is universally relatable. And those relationship-based conflicts were handled quite well. There were a couple points when I thought the story might fall prey to some of the issues that so often plague high school movies, but it never did. There were a couple things that felt implausible, but they all came from the character Martin, which made anything that felt inconsistent easier to accept or ignore.So I don't think we can expect this movie to take home a lot of acclaimed hardware in the coming weeks. But this is a movie that people will show to their kids the way that people show John Hughes movies to their kids now. I highly recommend it to anyone, though it probably won't appeal quite as much to older generations. If you haven't seen this, think Perks of Being a Wallflower but more mainstream and way less depressing. Overall Rating: 7.7/10","Love, Simon"
56,Darth_Osmosis,A great love story!,8,19 June 2018,"Very well done story, about a subject that can very easily go wrong. Most if not all characters were both believable and developed enough(seriously even the wannabe ""cool principal"" gets some depth!) to carry the intricate and complex story. The humor is great and works well, it never gets too serious or mopey.. but it doesn't turn into an all out comedy either! Great!","Love, Simon"
57,baileycrawly,"Love, Simon *Very Minor Spoilers*",7,6 February 2021,"Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda was an absolutely fantastic book. Although it's in the YA category, which is something I've traditionally avoided as much as possible, it had enough layers of depth to the plot to keep me interested and engaged throughout... particularly in the mystery of figuring out who exactly Blue is. There were a few clues littered along the way, but the novel really left it to be a surprise in the end.
The film completely misses that point and gives away the identity of Blue fairly early on. What's funny is that Simon, despite clearly knowing who it is, acts surprised when it's revealed to him.
Love, Simon is a fairly typical teen romance movie that's just been changed from a heterosexual relationship to a homosexual one. It's got some really solid acting, good characters, a fantastic soundtrack to back it up, and it presents a really cute love story that is most definitely worth your time. But there isn't a whole lot that sets it apart from other high school adolescent romance stories. There were a few moments that I was consciously aware of some of my favorite elements of the novel being excluded, and it was a little disappointing to see that; and there were also moments where it felt like the writers and director really didn't understand the source material they were adapting.
Overall, it's not a bad movie by any means, but I would highly recommend the book over the movie. The first half-hour or so of the film is a build-up to the very first few sentences of the novel. The novel starts right in the heart of the action and powers through the story with detail on every page, where this film has a little bit of a ""filler"" feeling about it, and a general awkwardness surrounding the execution of the main plot.
I still cried, though, so that is one thing I can say in his favor. Because they're still the characters I fell in love with when I read the book; it was just a different interpretation. And, going into the film already having the knowledge from the book, I had a deeper appreciation for all the characters.
Please, read the book first.","Love, Simon"
58,sweidman-28016,Good Romance,8,28 October 2018,"Love, Simon is the story about a teenage boy who doesn't want the secret to go around that he's gay. When I first saw the trailer for this a while ago I didn't think it was going to be that good. It looked like one of those movies that's based off of a teen novel that isn't that good. Once I saw the reviews and my friends started to talk about it I decided to go see it. Im very glad that I saw it. It was a movie we needed after the not so good recent releases and it was a great story. Nick Robinson as Simon was amazing. He was perfect for the role. Everyone else in the movie did well too. I liked the score and the music choices for the movie, as they worked well together. The only flaws I had were that the first act started out slow, but then it eventually sped up to tempo. There was also a part like that in the middle, but it went back on tempo again. It was a bit predictable, but I didn't mind that. If you're looking for something to do and you want to see an actually good movie in theaters, see Love, Simon.
My Grade: A-","Love, Simon"
59,bbewnylorac,Nice movie but takes no risks,6,10 July 2021,"It's a good and I guess ground breaking movie in at least taking on the topic of a teenager who is unsure about coming out as gay.As Simon, the closeted gay teenager who is fighting the idea of coming out, Nick Robinson is well cast, although it is a cliche how cute his family is, with perfect parents and sister.They're middle class and with no struggles. It would have been more interesting with a few more unpredictable elements thrown in.Such as maybe if he had homophobic parents and a football star brother.Also the conflicts in the script probably aren't serious enough.Maybe there should have been a violent gang at the school hassling him, or a girl develops a major crush on him.The film is determined to be very conservative and safe, which is not very interesting.So he sends a few emails to another anonymous gay guy, and a classmate sees the emails and blackmails him.Why doesn't Simon try going to a gay club or watch gay films online?One of his friends is already out as gay, and is very much accepted, but I guess the movie is saying that some people are much more reticent.","Love, Simon"
60,gab-67599,Noting special,5,7 April 2021,"As a bisexual woman, it was refreshing to see two men kiss. WAY to many movies have women on women kissing but bot enough male on male kissing. It is like Hollywood is afraid to even tap that story. BUT, I could not connect with Simon. His character was so weak and cliché. Then, how everyone just accepted him for who he was! I wish the world was really like this but it is NOT! It was a cute story, with bad actors and they could not even get the kiss right! It felt and looked so forced. So much so that I felt sorry for the two kissing whether they were gay or not in real life.","Love, Simon"
61,joelwatchesmovies,A typically quirky high school dramedy with refreshing underlying drama,8,20 August 2018,"I'll leave judgment of the overall portrayal of being gay to non-hetero people (though it's encouraging that the director is one), but to me it sure was refreshing to see the gay love story happy ending (even if it was a little cheesy), and I thought the complicated internal tension of Simon's coming out process was captured really well (the proof was in my sobbing at the beautiful line ""You can exhale now""). Robinson is excellent, and the underlying high school dramedy is perfectly quirky.

62,paulcreeden,Gay movie for straight audience.,6,28 May 2019,"I don't begrudge young gay boys a romantic semi-comedy in 2018, but I don't think this really sets a higher mark for gay cinema. First, from a gay male perspective, it is not a comedy really. It is a tragedy in the eyes of this Stonewall Era gay man. The tragedy being that coming out in middle class America can still be portrayed as involving such angst and individual cowardice, as displayed by the lead gay characters. Simon is a rather unrespectable young man from a gay male perspective. And his pathetic apology to his out Black classmate after he is outed just makes him more so. He chooses to conform to maintain his popularity , manipulates his friends and even potentially exposes his love interest, Blue, to mob ridicule.The fact that some straight reviewers ooze over this film may have to do with their understanding that so much acceptance of LGBT youth by heterosexuals is rather shallow. It's OK for someone else's son or daughter to be gay. The one realistic person in this film was Simon's father, a thick-headed jock who tells fag jokes and actually is dependent on his closeted gay son's approval for self-esteem. Best part of the film, in my opinion. If the entire film had more of the nuance of the very funny drama teacher, it would have been better. She represents the brave and frustrated spirit more in keeping with gay boys who know who they are in a straight context.","Love, Simon"
63,fciocca,"A journey inside the head of a teenager, with a big secret",7,2 February 2020,"""Love, Simon"" is unexpected. I approached at first this movie in the wrong way: I was sure that I was going to watch the usual teen drama about a guy that discovers to be gay, with a predictable ending. I was very wrong. It was a well structured movie with an interesting and captivating story about a teenage guy that already acknowledged which his sexual orientation is, and he's suffering, because he is hiding it from his friends and family.Even if some narrative choices may be cliches, overall the movie gives a pretty realistic vision of the coming out process. The narrated story could happen to anyone, there is not excessive drama, no useless beat up, no blaming on the society: the guy is the victim, but at the same time, when he takes some wrong decisions, is punished and the fact that he's gay is not used as a gateway for his wrong actions. The movie is extremely balanced and does not take a real position: it just show thing as they would happen. Human reactions are credible and acting is overall good.Another strong point of this movie is that it is not targeted for a specific kind of audience: everyone can watch it and learn some valuable lessons. This movie teaches that everyone should live his own sexuality as he would like, because is something that is extremely personal, without too many pressions from the outside.","Love, Simon"

66,kaptenvideo-89875,Film about how it's ok to be gay.,7,4 July 2018,"One of the main lure of the movies is their ability to introduce us to magical lands and experiences that we'd never otherwise witness.That's probably one reason why so many recent movies about gay people have found such a warm mainstream reception. It sure is fascinating to get a glimpse of lifestyle that most of us would never experience by oneselves (nor even want to, but that's another topic).""Love, Simon"" is a curious beast, a first mainstream Young Adult movie with a gay protagonist. It is very much a spiritual successor of John Hughes's popular teen movies of 1980's, only this time with the hero afraid to, you know, come out.The Hughes blueprint has its downfalls, namely the story doesn't dare to venture outside the cute territory, never placing the hero in any real danger or conflict - mostly everybody is supportive of Simon, or at least doesn't care about his orientation, etc.This makes the story always rather predictable. Yet the dialogue, relationships, and the characters still manage to remain fresh and charming, which saves it from becoming too pedestrian, despite the ""middle of the road"" approach and all.Even when the movie comes dangerously close to becoming too sugary for its own good - Simon coming out to his family and the resulting conversations - it somehow manages to stay on the not embrarrasing side, keeping us engaged.I would even argue that the second half of the movie is stronger because Simon's coming out adds purpose and authenticity to the story, which can sometimes feel a bit aimless during the first hour.The cast is just lovely, their committed performaces are also an important part of the overall success.We have Nick Robinson playing Simon, Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner as Simon's parents, and a motley crew of whatstheirnames playing his friends, including Jorge Lendebord Jr., Logan Miller, Alexandra Shipp, Katherine Langford, et al. I also quite enjoyed Tony Hale as the vice principal of the school.There has been a number of really good and well-received movies about gay people in recent years, including ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Behind the Candelabra"", """"La vie d'Adèle"" (""Blue Is the Warmest Colour""), ""Tom of Finland"", and ""Call Me by Your Name"".""Love, Simon"" may not deserve a place among the best of them but it's sweet and well-realised in its own right. Plus definitely a trailblazing example of depicting LGBT+ community in mainstream Young Adult movies.","Love, Simon"

70,patriciogl10,"Be yourself, express yourself, love yourself.",8,1 September 2018,"What a great story. I completely enjoyed this movie, and felt so sympathetic towards the main character, Simon (Nick Robinson). The film contains an obvious positive message that is simply impossible to ignore. I've read that this movie has inspired many people, and that is reason enough to deem this movie as important. I've always been a huge fan of coming-of-age movies, and I felt this one was special. Simon has it all, a loving family, a great group of friends but he has one secret. He is inspired by a post a user called Blue made which everyone at school seems to read; in the post this Blue person revealed being gay, to which Simon decides to send him an email, and they bonded over this exchange of emails. Blue won't reveal his identity and Simon neither, but he wants to know who he is; so he starts looking for clues in order to uncover his identity; meanwhile Simon struggles with having his secret and not being able to tell anybody. One day at the school's library he leaves his Gmail account open and Martin (Logan Miller), one of his classmates reads and takes a screenshot of his emails and blackmails Simon to help him with his friend Abby (Alexandra Shipp).The supporting cast does a great job, Katherine Langford, Josh Duhamel, Jennifer Garner and Tony Hale who is hilarious as the school's vice principal.In my opinion, Love, Simon sheds a much needed light on a subject that despite being in 2018 seems to have eluded us for a long time. This is the first major studio release to feature a gay teen in the lead, so that's saying a lot.
It's a sweet, heartwarming piece that definitely ranks high in the coming-of-age type of movies; I imagine that if John Hughes were alive and decided to make a movie out of Simon vs.the Homo Sapiens Agenda (the novel which Love, Simon is based, written by Becky Albertalli) it would resemble a lot like this film. 
Another great thing about the movie is its soundtrack; it's funny how lately many of this type of movies made by adults show teen characters with such a respectable music taste; he listens to Waterloo Sunset by The Kinks, has posters of Kid A by Radiohead and all of this is complemented well by a more modern soundtrack that fits well with the film's tone.So don't wait around, see this fabulous movie and even if you don't like it, you will respect it because of its uplifting message: always be yourself. On a second view this could become a favorite of mine.","Love, Simon"
71,austin0731,Feel good teen drama,7,4 May 2018,"What Love, Simon does very well is portray a teenage drama about a gay teenager who has to come to terms with his identity and his 'secret'. The film explores the concept in a way that doesn't make homosexuality a label or a major focus of the film per se. But rather, the idea of having a secret that you cannot tell your friends, family, this is a great way in both allowing audiences to empathize with the character by creating a common situation and also to respectfully deal with homosexuality not as some sort of a marketing attraction but something that is sort of 'just there'.Love, Simon never tries to make the fact that Simon is gay something to discuss or preach about but rather conveying the normality and how ordinary this character is. The film attempts to send this message that yes, Simon is gay but that's not necessarily something to dwell on because at the end of the day the story is of love and friendship and it is a feel good romance, that just so happens to star a gay main character. Love, Simon captures many aspects of teenage life well, presenting the warmth and companionship of the character. However, on several occasions it does just drift into teen-drama cliches and archetypal side characters that to some degree takes a bit away from what this film could be. But at the end of the day Love, Simon is about the choices we make, who we want to be and to be the best self that you can be. A simple but effective message pact into an easy, light, feel-good watch.","Love, Simon"
72,asifahsankhan,A far refreshing yet honest view of that particular 'coming out' leitmotif.,8,24 April 2018,"After the success of Call Me by Your Name, it isn't a surprise that Love, Simon has made the world fall in love with it and you only have to watch it once to see why.Love, Simon is a coming-of-age story about a teenager called Simon (Nick Robinson) who falls in love with a male classmate via email, whose alias is 'Blue'. Neither his family nor friends know that he's gay, and the film focuses on Simon's confusion as he tries to figure out who Blue is, and the distress he experiences as an acquaintance threatens to out him, unless he helps him get to know his friend, Abby (Alexandra Shipp).Simon, or his online alias Jaques, starts emailing Blue when an anonymous post is published on their high school's blog, which talks about the distress of being gay whilst having a seemingly normal life and family, and not knowing how to come out. The post ends with an anonymous email address, and their relationship blossoms from there on out.The protagonist has a tight-knit group of friends, Leah (Katherine Langford), Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and Abby (Shipp). He's been friends with Leah and Nick since pre-school (or kindergarten as they call it) and Abbie since she moved to the school three months ago. The actors and characters are perfectly balanced, if a bit politically correct - there were two people of colour and two white people -, but this combination didn't feel forced; the portrayals of the characters were amazingly genuine and natural.The casting in this film made it extremely enjoyable and offered a pure and legitimate reminiscence of the insecurities involved in the high-school experience.Simon describes his family life as being 'totally normal' and seems to have extremely hip and down-to-earth parents (Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel) - he describes them as the star-quarterback and gorgeous valedictorian- and so he narrates the emotional turmoil he feels in coming out to his friends and family, as he doesn't want to disrupt the perfection or for anything to change. Simon's experience is one that everyone can identify with and gives a heart-warming and encouraging narrative.Love, Simon also offers a refreshing yet honest view of coming out and may possibly inspire others to do so. It also delves into the distress experienced when deciding when and how to come out, and the anxiety that occurs when it happens against one's own will. The only qualm I could raise about the film is the over-exaggerated character of the school's principal, who is classically extremely exuberant and involved in his students' lives. However, it is encouraging to see a portrayal of a teacher who authentically cares about their students.The soundtrack and the ambient colour-grading added to the nostalgic feel of the film, whilst the cast and representation of today's society offered a refreshing view on the coming-of-age format. Overall, this was a wholly enjoyable film which I would recommend to any film-goer.","Love, Simon"

I couldn't help thinking how much more powerful it would have been if the 17-year-old characters were actually played by 17-year-olds and not by actors in their mid-twenties.

I did not lose a single friend when I came out. I gained a new family of friends. I encourage anyone younger, or older, that is not out to do so. BUT, only when you are ready. You'll know when the time is right. This might just be one of the most important movies of the year. I believe there needs to be more movies like this.

75,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"A pretty familiar rom-com tale, but this time with a gay lead",7,14 June 2018,"Love, Simon was a pretty good heartwarming rom-com. And I do think its very refreshing to see a gay protagonist in film like this and not have another movie come out about the AIDS crisis (not that the topic isnt important). However, I think if you take that one aspect out, the movie does look and feel like a lot of other teen rom-coms before it. Like for example the protagonist thinking of only themselves and hurts their friends in the process. The teachers were a little over the top. And I get it was done to throw some comedy in there, but I have never met a teacher/principal who would have openly talked about their tinder dates with students. I also found that Simon's friends (especially the character of Nick played by Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) were fleshed out. The only thing we really know about his character is that he plays soccer and is in love with Ally. Without the exposition that Simon and him have been best friends since they were 4, I wouldn't have had anything to go of off. I mean, we never really see them hang out together (outside of the group), we don't see them have any shared interests. Even though we don't learn much about Katharine Langford's character either (Leah) at least we have a scene where she sleeps over at his house and where she also has a heart to heart with him. And there was one eye-rolling moment where theres a cut of Simon opening up his itunes and selecting a song by Bleachers, and then when the next Bleachers song comes up, the group all silently rock out in the car for 5 seconds at the same time that Jack Antonoff's music credit comes up on screen. It felt like a very forced ""Buy my music"" ad. But other than those things I did enjoy the movie. I smiled and laughed a lot, and I also teared up. I had mad tears in my eyes when Simon had both a heart to heart with his mom and then his dad after coming out. I just loved the line about he finally gets to exhale. And there was one very 500 Days of Summer-esque dance sequence that made me light up. And I think overall Nick Robinson did a good job playing the title character. Though, I still think his best role/movie to date was The Kings of Summer. This is a movie I would recommend. It's fun and cute and likeable.","Love, Simon"
76,Jared_Andrews,"Important, sure, but it's also just a terrific movie",8,16 August 2018,"Viewers can look at this movie and say that it has value for its importance, and I think that's true. I would also say that this is just a terrific movie. Period.Simon (Nick Robinson) is a high school senior. He loves him family. He has wonderful friends. He's an upstanding student and is headed to respected university next year. He's pretty much a typical, likable teenager. But he has a big secret: he's gay. When another kid at school, who is also secretly gay, posts an anonymous message on a popular school social site, Simon contacts him using his own anonymous email. They connect and encourage each other, eventually inspiring one another to come out to friends and family. It's fun little 'You've Got Mail' style relationship.The story is consistently well-told, moves at a brisk, light pace. Comic relief always arrives at the ideal time to ease the tension when needed. Tony Hale is an absolute riot playing the overzealous vice principal who tries awkwardly to connect with students. Natasha Rothwell is equally hilarious and entertaining as the incredulous drama teacher. The only complaint I have is that these actors disappear for an extended stretch in the film's middle. In addition to the humor, you'll see a few wonderful filmmaking displays, such as a cut from characters beginning to walk up stairs in one setting to them exiting the top of a stairwell in another. There's a delightful montage of kids coming out to their parents as straight, as a part of Simon's internal monologue wondering why gay kids are the ones who have to ""come out."" ""Why is straight the default?"" Simon wonders. Not a bad question. It's that level of creativity and thoughtfulness that elevates what could have been a pedestrian coming-of-age story into a terrific one. If you seek a heart-warming story that won't elicit eye rolls, look no further. 'Love, Simon' is delightful story that will speak to many kids who are looking to feel less alone.","Love, Simon"
77,scb_coldsteel,I do love Simon!,8,1 October 2018,"So I just saw Love Simon in theaters. I really had no plans to watch this movie as I just don't like teen romantic comedies, but after a few solid recommendations I gave in. To my great surprise I very much enjoyed this movie.Unlike most teen romantic comedies this movie has a lot of heart. There were many times the movie brought a tear to my eye. I didn't find the movie to be emotionally manipulative or heavy-handed either. It just all around funny and heartwarming.The movie also does a great job portraying the confusion and complexity of adolescents. The interactions between Simon and his friends felt genuine and real. There really weren't any typical tropes from this genre in the film. Overall it felt like a very human film.To add, the movie was just all around funny. Not stupid funny but really smart funny. I had a lot of fun and enjoyment watching this movie. I just did not expect to walk into a movie targeting teens that could be this smat. All around it is a well written work of art.Acting wise the movie was also solid. There really wasn't a role that I thought was truly outstanding, but everyone did a good job and played their part. My one major criticism of the movie is that the ending felt a tad too Hollywood cookie cutter happy-ending for me. This of course could just be the cynic in me, but the last 20 minutes or so just did not feel genuine or real to me. For a movie that held itself up by being genuine, it just felt a little out of place. All in all this has been one of my favorite viewing experiences of 2018. I really recommend anyone to watch this movie. It is a rare example of a movie that may be classified as a teen romantic comedy, but is still smart and heartwarming at the same time. A 8.5 out of 10.","Love, Simon"

Add in the overly played, yet entertaining, HS Principle Tony Hale (""Veep"") and the very funny Ms. Albright (Natasha Rothwell ""Saturday Night Live""), and the production just keeps getting better. Berlanti knows how to encourage his actors to play the honest moment and listen to each other. For anyone holding a secret like Simon's, this film will hit home.

80,maddiebuggie,Love Simon review,8,27 April 2020,I loved this movie. I thought it was a great idea for a movie. I was hyper for the movie from the first time I watched the trailer. Sure enough when I finally got to watch it. It was just as good as I though it be for the most part. I loved every part of this movie but the part where the guy that loves Simon and that Simon loves end up being a dude that was from a party who was making out with a girl. That the whole part I didn't like. But overall the movie was good. It was a lgbt/ boy love story. The romance was great and the chemistry was fine between the actors. I wasn't that big into there love it just Becuse I didn't feel that much chemistry between them. The plot line and storyline was great. This is a good story for everyone no matter the age. I'll sure in the future be watching this agian.,"Love, Simon"
81,edicionccq,"I don't ""Love, Simon""",3,1 December 2019,"""Love, Simon"" was the queer movie I was most excited to see in 2018. The cast was pretty decent, and the trailer is very funny. Also, the plot seems fascinating. So at the first chance that I have, I watched the movie and am just going to say that I was disappointed.The leading character has the looks but not the charm. I'm gay, but I couldn't relate to him in any single way. He makes unkind things to his friends to hide a secret, I know, being gay isn't something easy to accept but he doesn't seem to be in an environment where he could be judge by that. His family is so charming, and his friends are so open-minded and still he makes bad decisions that hurt some friends.The main plot of the movie is keeping his sexuality as a secret and finding who blue is. I already declared why I didn't enjoy the first part of the plot. But the second part, finding who blue is, is indeed worst. He falls in love with every single guy who he suspects is ""Blue"" and that kills the romance. At the end when Blue is ultimately revealed, I didn't feel anything for them. It wasn't chemistry.In conclusion, ""Love, Simon"" is a movie that shines because is a gay-friendly movie but it's so overrated and that makes me hate it more. The leading character is boring and the plot doesn't support him.","Love, Simon"
82,sini-200,Revolutionary coming of age movie of all times,10,5 May 2018,"I know I based my knowledge on the book by Becky Albertalli (which, definitely recommend checking out) and even I had a lot of expectations since loving the book so much, this movie was even better than I imagined. The adaption from the book to movie was incredible and I love the choices Greg made so the movie worked so well. The way the story is normalized: Simon is just like every high school kid with great friends and family, except he has a big secret. I feel everyone can relate to this movie, to Simon, no matter straight or gay. I already fell in love with Simon in the books, but Nick did the character justice and gave amazing depth. Now I don't think anyone else would have fit for the role. I fell in love with Simon and in the end rooted for him to realize who Blue was - even I read the book. Even I knew who would end up being Blue, the way the entire ""who Blue is among these boys"" was built wonderfully, that kept you guessing. And that revelation and the sweet, romantic moment after was one of the greatest cinematography scenes I've ever witnessed. Nick and Keiynan were incredible and had such amazing chemistry even before it was relieved he was the boy he fell in love with. We're used to get them in straight white love stories all the time and everywhere, where the moment happens as the boy gets the girl and the big ""kiss scene"" in the end, but seeing it happening with two boys is breaking all the rules in mainstream romantic movies - and I loved every second of it. We need more movies like this, breaking the stereotypes and taboos. We've waited decades to get more amazing LGBT+ great love stories, with great actors, plot and a happy ending. The importance of gay teen love story that has a happy ending where no one dies and they get together is not common at all, so to see that makes my heart rejoice. The importance of people seeing themselves represented well and living a happy life with their partner is remarkable and very important in the media. We need to change that in movies we can see all sexualities POSITIVELY represented with happy endings. So hopefully more big mainstream film studios will keep making more movies like this because it's worth while and there is a big audience for these kind of great stories. I feel like Love Simon was just the beginning. 10/10","Love, Simon"

Simon is a likable character and he isn't a stereotypical gay character. His family is such a normal and accepting family and the scene with his mom when she tries to talk to him about his coming out is so heart warming and real. Such a great film. It is an important film for parents, families, and people who are afraid to come out to see. Christians should see this and hopefully it can change there minds about the LGBT community.

86,jakob13,Simeon's Blue,2,25 March 2018,"Hollywood may have made technological strides in film making, but 'Love, Simon"" is a hoary reminder of the teen romances of the 'Date with Judy' kind.
It is a fairy tale (no pun intended) of coming out unwillingly in suburban South California.
Simon find his 'true love' on a gay chat site, then is outed and voila the drama?
Everything about the film is cotton candy and jelly beans. 
Simon and friends live in an upper class community; big houses, automobiles. Obviously they belong to the bracket that nears the one percent. No one seems to work. The high school is something that no inner city kid will ever know. We are among the privileged: well feed, sparkling white teeth, clean duds and soap clean hands. Simon's bed room is well appointed, something a homeless family of five would die for. Everyone is understanding, everyone smiles, and Simon's world is peachy clean, in a world--almost nirvana. 
But for the outing which is treated so delicately and oh, too, too in a noble and upper income manner, denies the reality of the lower class gays who struggle against discrimination, rejection by family, condemned by religion, despite the more 'tolerant' America that when political winds shift, is readily to brand them as deviants and worse. 
But we wouldn't know this from Simon's world. The film pleases, it goes without saying in a time of Trump and an America on the slide. Any distraction is worth the high price of admission with huge tubs of popcorn.
'Love, Simon' is so saccharine, even the middle age audiences and seniors sigh and smile and nod knowingly to each other. Give me my money back!","Love, Simon"
87,themovieparadise,I was not expecting it to be as good as it is!,9,3 April 2018,"""Everyone deserves a great love story,"" says Simon, the main character of Love, Simon, played by Nick Robinson. It's sad to say that, with the hundreds of movies that come out every year, we have only a finite number of gay love stories. We've had a few movies about gay people finding themselves, such as Moonlight, but there are barely any regular coming-of-age romantic comedies about gay kids, and that is incredibly unfortunate. Luckily, we now have Love, Simon. It comes from Greg Berlanti, who is openly gay himself, who has made a name for himself running uber-successful comic book shows on television such as Arrow and The Flash. He has also produced some movies including Green Lantern and Pan. With Love, Simon, Berlanti directs his third feature film, following The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy and Life as We Know It. I have not seen his previous movies, but Berlanti has done a phenomenal job with his television series. So since I knew Berlanti more as a TV guy, and because I wasn't familiar with his movie directing style (nor were his previous films huge critical successes, having a 64% and a 28% on Rotten Tomatoes respectively), I wasn't sure how Love, Simon was going to turn out. However, it's a fantastic movie. Berlanti does a phenomenal job delivering on a film that entirely emotionally hooks you...","Love, Simon"
88,chong_an,"Come out, come out, be whoever you are.",8,20 March 2018,"This is a teen coming-out story that is overly positive, even for liberal north America. Geared towards a general audience rather than just a gay market, it encourages kids to come out. Little bad will happen, the only thing to fear is fear itself, and most problems come from hiding your true self.I am not surprised that the ratings decline with age. Older audiences had less acceptance with coming out, and would likely find the movie less realistic. I expect the movie to be banned or severely restricted in socially conservative countries. For the opposite, pessimistic view, the Oscar-winning A Fantastic Woman is still playing.I would have liked Blue to be less attractive. Since Simon fell in love purely by email, would love overcome physical unattractiveness, as suggested by the recent movie Every Day?","Love, Simon"
89,RMurray847,"Entertaining, but didn't feel terribly vital",7,8 January 2021,"I enjoyed LOVE, SIMON kinda like I'd enjoy any high-school rom-com. The cruelties and cluelessness of teenagers. The house party when the parents are out. The romantic misunderstandings. The disproportionate importance of ""drama class/school play"" (I was a drama major and president of drama club in high school...I know drama is NEVER as important to the school as these movies want it to be). So many cliches, but you know what, they can still be entertaining. Lots of great examples, spanning decades: CLUELESS, MEAN GIRLS, BOOK SMART, etc. etc. It feels to me like LOVE, SIMON wants to be one of those movies and also to be something a bit meatier, like PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER.Well, it is entertaining enough. There are plenty of charming secondary characters, including the incredibly plucky ""new girl"" who becomes best friends with our protagonists little group. Were there ever really kids that bubbly, mature, lovely, funny and vibrant? And she pairs nicely with the slightly less vibrant but nearly as plucky long-time best friend (who is also a girl). I just don't remember in my high school years that there were so many groups of mixed gender besties. (BUT, that was 1981...so I'm willing to accept that things have changed.)So, you probably know that the main ""twist"" in this predictably structured movie is that our main character, Simon, is gay and is NOT out yet. He's thinking about it, but he's scared. And this is in a school where clearly 99% of the population (other than the 2 mean jocks who torment everyone) would not care one bit about his sexuality. BUT, he's nervous about what his parents (Jennifer Garner / Josh Duhamel) will think. He guards his secret pretty well, and the ONLY other ""out"" person in his school is such an outrageous cliche that Simon has little chance of giving himself away if he wants to keep his secret until college.Anyway, it all seems light and not exactly fraught with consequence. We know when he does finally come out, there will be some bumps but of course his family will love him and support him. His friends will only be mad because he hadn't told them sooner. So it's hard to invest into this film emotionally...it's fast-paced and never boring. The characters are reasonably witty. Too much voice-over to tell the story, but that's not a fatal flaw either. It's just a fun watch with no ooomph. I guess it's a good sign that a coming out movie can now tell that story without it being a drama. That we've come far enough that we all know (except Simon) that it will all be okay. And yet, that same ""lightness"" also makes it almost immediately forgettable. I saw it five days ago, and I already can't remember who Simon ""ends up with"" at the end. Some guy that left no lasting memory.By all means, watch the film. Just know that it's dramatic aspirations will fall well short and it will mostly just leave you with a pleasant smile. There are worse things a movie can do, certainly. It's too bad LOVE, SIMON didn't embrace the humor more and leave the quest for meaning to another film altogether.","Love, Simon"

91,brianjohnson-20043,Good film. Worth seeing. But a few tweeks could have made it even better,8,19 March 2018,"This film is a coming of age modern day film. Don't expect the best movie you've ever seen, but expect a good movie. It has good acting performances. It has some laughs. It has deep poignant moments. If you've seen Wonder, this film has a lot of similarities. The trailer makes it seem like it's about one character. When really they're about the one character and their entire community. Even though there's a lot of movies dealing with homosexuality or coming of age, this one is distinct because it deals with both and takes place around 2018. Like most movies pushing drama and comedy, it has some hits and misses in finding the right balance. The Vice Principal and Drama instructor reminded me of the gym teacher from Ladybird. All of them are funny, but if they their absurdity goes too far it can undermine the more real and poignment dramatic moments of the story. I felt that this happened from time to time.As far as the story, I won't spoil, but I'll hint: Overall it's an enjoyable ride. Simon is much more than just a gay character. Both of the parents were well written and acted in particular. I liked that both of the parents were former popular kids and not a cliché of peaking in high school. Simon's friends were convincing and went through interesting trials. I think that the climax wasn't ideal. And I'll loosely explain why: The main character Simon is dealing with coming out as gay. The man he's attracted to is in a similar boat, and Simon gets upset at the way he's forced to come out. But rather than allow his love interest the opportunity he wished he had, he really pressures him to come out in similar terms. This is the Farris Wheel scene. This scene seemed to add closure to one of the less beloved characters. But overall the scene seemed to do more harm than good. And I think they could have had Simon meet Blue in a less cheesy Hollywood way, and the movie would have been all the better for it. The movie already had a scene where they go to school following Simon and Blue getting together. That could have been extended to them in school as a way of displaying the characters getting over the high school judgement and the school accepting and embracing them. I also thought that the main characters' long list of friends and run ins was a bit longer and more complicated than was ideal. I thought they could have spent more time establishing the Leah character and maybe the sister in the beginning. Or established his friends in a better way than voiceover. Especially given that that voiceover section is repeated later on in the film in one of Simon's letters anyway. I also thought Simon's email being discovered could have been addressed better. For instance a crazier thing could have driven him to forget his email was left on a public computer. He kind of made a Baby Boomer computer blunder, which was hard to buy given how secretive his information was. This was definitely another high school movie in which 80% of the high school actors looked too old to be in high school. For the Record about 20% of them seeming too old doesn't bother me. What bothers me is when the average high school character looks about 25. And that was my perception in Love, Simon In contrast, Spider-Man Homecoming didn't seem to have this issue. They actually looked like the average character in high school was about 16 or 17 years old. Another coming of age stereotypy mistake this film had was the typically good high school kids throwing a giant parties in which nearly everyone from high school shows up, drinks, etc. I get the need for a party scene, and don't deny that they happen. But too often they seem unnecessarily over-the-top. Especially when the kids seem pretty well balanced, like the kids in this film.I also really liked the first openly gay student in the school. I thought his character could have been more full and prominent to the story. Especially given how supportive Simon's family was. The initial openly gay character's situation could have served more as a stronger and more interesting contrast. Also if his character was a little less sympathetic, it could have made the story a bit more interesting. It also seems that the first openly gay person at school is often more flamboyant, and usually faces more persecution and can become somewhat flawed in some ways because of this. I think this would have been a good direction for this character.Honestly, the movie is mostly good, even if my review seems like I pointed out quite a few things I wish were different. It's definitely still worth seeing. I'm glad it was made. I hope it makes money. I think it's great for coming of age stories to exist in 2018, rather than just exist in the 80s and 90s","Love, Simon"
92,ccamp89,It's a start.,6,24 March 2018,"I hate to be hard on Love, Simon. Its heart is in the right place and its importance as a landmark film for the LGBTQ community can't be understated. It's truly momentous that we live in a time where a film like this can get produced by a major studio and released to a wide audience, and its warm message of inclusion, acceptance, and being true to yourself is admirable. Nick Robinson carries the film well, and it does have some genuinely touching scenes, particularly Simon's first coming out moment which felt both spontaneous and powerful.But a film cannot stand on intention alone. If you're going to Love, Simon hoping for a nuanced and insightful coming-of-age tale that explores these themes with any level of depth, you're likely going to be disappointed. For better or worse, it is a film that fits very snugly into the broad, widely accessible high school dramedy genre targeted squarely at the teenage demographic. It isn't much different in tone than what you would see from a Disney Channel film. And in a way, that's great. This is a film that teens should see and is well aware of what it is; it's not out to be the next Moonlight or Call Me By Your Name and that's okay.But even when viewed through that frame, Love, Simon is just a bit too broad and superficial for this particular story. It doesn't tap enough into the very confusing and complex emotions involved in coming to terms with your sexuality and the product, while feel-good and pleasant, ultimately has a hollow and artificial ring. The character arcs and resolutions feel too neat and tidy, and the high school environment and its students don't quite react in ways that feel authentic or real. The film just doesn't dig below the surface, and I don't think the genre and the target demographic are enough to give it a pass on that.***SPOILERS***I feel it's worth going into some specifics about the finale of the film which I had some major issues with. The whole climax is predicated on a post that Simon decides to make on the high school forum in which he, very publically, implores ""Blue"" to reveal his identity by meeting him at the Ferris wheel on a specific date and time after the school play. This is in the context of ""Blue"" pulling back on their email chain, telling Simon that he's not feeling ready to move forward with coming out publically and deleting his anonymous email account. I took it as quite insensitive and selfish of Simon to react by publically calling out ""Blue"" online in this way in front of the whole school. In reality, that would put ""Blue"" in an incredibly awkward and potentially damaging situation. Obviously, in the world of the film, this decision ends up leading to an uplifting finale where Simon gives ""Blue"" the strength to ultimately reveal his identity, and no less kiss Simon on the Ferris wheel while a sizable audience of their classmates watches and collectively sighs. It feels very contrived, unrealistic, and is a prime example of the warm yet hollow quality of the film.***END OF SPOILERS***Despite my serious issues with Love, Simon, I by no means hated it. Again, its heart is in the right place and it's undeniably an important film that is likely to have a positive impact on the target demographic and beyond, regardless of the sexual orientation of the viewer. Purely on its merits as a film, it leaves a lot to be desired, but it is a serviceable launching point that will hopefully open the door for more and better films dealing with this important subject.3/5","Love, Simon"
93,richarddillomes,This is the movie we needed when my generation was growing up,8,7 October 2019,"Helmed to be one of this generation's homage to John Hughes (well-curated soundtrack, romantic comedy in a high school setting), we're not exaggerating when we say this is the movie we needed when my generation was growing up.Back in the day, I remember there was only one gay character on mainstream media: Jack McPhee from Dawson's Creek, a football player originally brought in to play a love triangle with Dawson and Joey. Eventually he broke TV grounds when he came out as gay and was the first featured ever male gay kiss on primetime television. This was back in the year 2000.Going further back, the other gay character I had access to was Matt Fielding from Melrose Place in the early 90s. For a show that was all about gossip and scandals, surprisingly enough it relegated Matt in the background as the token gay character, way before the term was even conceived.Fast forward to today and we have Love, Simon, a coming-of-age movie about Simon Spier, who is gay but is unable to come out for fear of being bullied and ridiculed and ends up exchanging anonymous messages with the other gay person in his school hiding under the name Blue. When a fellow student comes across their exchanges, Simon is forced further to remain in the closet when he is blackmailed to score the guy a date with one his girl friends (ah, don't you just miss high school life?)Whether it was intentional that aside from the lead every one else (i.e. straight) was relegated to the background as supporting characters mostly because they didn't prolong some of the conflicts enough, making it seem like coming out is that easy. Sometimes it is, sometimes it can be messy. But the point is you'll never know until you try. And even if the movie didn't get it all right, it echoes what the lead Nick Robinson said in one his interviews, it's at least a conversation starter.","Love, Simon"
94,JonathanWalford,Disneyfied 90s Romcom of a serious issue...,3,10 April 2018,"This film doesn't work because it is trying to be too many things, and doesn't do any of them particularly well. It actually looks like the director read the book, and then pulled ten movies to borrow ideas from to turn the book into a film. It's part Disney flick, complete with super happy shiny teens (who all look like they are in their mid 20s), fast quipping teachers, and hot-looking parents stuck in a comedy where everything can be resolved with a hug. It's part 80s/90s John Hughes style comedy, complete with over-acted goofy characters including a nerdy vice-principal and a sassy black theatre teacher, and it's even part High School Musical, with a lame rainbow dance sequence half-way through the film where the star proves he has no Terpsichore talents. The writing relies upon the most basic of misdirections used in the lesser works by mystery writers, where the most obvious murderer is the first one given an alibi.I blame mostly the director, who although he is gay, has an over-romanticized view of how coming out is for most gay men. Also at fault is the lead actor, who doesn't come across as gay at all and can't seem to find the 17 year old gay character anymore than any Disney actor in his mid 20s should be expected to. I am sure it is possible to make a comedy out of a heart-wrenching experience like coming out, but this is not it. I gave it 3 stars because that is EXACTLY the number of times I laughed during this sad, unfunny comedy. There are too many icky cringe scenes, creepy characters, cheesy heart warming moments, and over-the-top acting to make this film work. If you want to see something that actually deals with this topic sensitively and honestly, see Edge of Seventeen (1998).","Love, Simon"
95,Mike_Yike,"A Good, and Modern Film",7,17 August 2020,"I am an older dude and as I watched Love, Simon I occasionally thought of my own high school days 50 years ago. They were nothing like the high school, or the students, portrayed in the movie. We had no gay kids, or so we thought. So like everyone else who saw the movie, I watched the Love, Simon from my own personal perspective.Fortunately the film had Simon as a conservative-type gay person. He had to be conservative since he was hiding his sexual orientation from everyone, everyone except the viewing audience. In fact, Love, Simon is about the teenage student revealing his gay persona to those in his world. It is a journey that is pretty well chronicled by the film.The only problem I had was the ending. Simon comes out of the closet and almost immediately finds a love interest. And he does so in front of dozens of cheering classmates as he rides a Ferris wheel. I kind of shook my head at those scenes. They seemed out of place in the movie and out of place for the character of Simon. The five minutes simply came off as goofy.

Simon's secret of being gay comes to light to fellow student Martin. Simon has kept this secret from everyone around him and it's threatened by him. As such, Simon has to give into his demands, even if it slowly diminishes his relationships with his friends.Love Simon may seem like a generic teen coming-out movie from some of the trailers, but its execution is far better than what it looks like from the trailers. The scenario feels very realistic as well as relatable to anyone who has a huge secret such as being gay. The characters here feel like real teenagers; Simon shows insecurities about his secret being revealed and is worried about what will his friends and family will think about him. Martin is a manipulating, and yet likable jerk who goes through some great character development by the end of the movie. Simon's friends try their best to be supportive even though they realize that something's up. It all feels very realistic with dialogue that doesn't feel out-of-place of forced.My issue with the movie that keeps it from being a perfect 10 is that the ending feels rushed when compared to the rest of the movie. As the movie comes to its climax and Simon finally does come out, we barely see any interactions from Simon and his friends in between, and it kind of confused me as to whether Simon made up with (most of) his friends or not.Either way, Love, Simon is a fantastic and relatable teen romance film about a gay guy who struggles with keeping his secret while establishing a connection with somebody who's just like him.9/10","Love, Simon"
97,seige-hound,A Movie Every Questioning Teen Should See,8,30 March 2018,"I'm not gonna call this film high art. This film is a very Hollywood film, set in high school with a whole lot of beautiful actors that look a few years older than actual high schoolers. The story is very straightforward and ordinary, but it has one big secret: It's gay.That's the thing about it, that's what makes it such a big deal. This is a gay movie for teenagers! How often does that happen? It's not even like Mean Girls where one (arguably two) of the side characters are gay but the story doesn't really address it. This is a movie, rated PG-13, where the main character is gay, and the story is about him coming out.The other gay movie that I saw recently was Call Me By Your Name, which is a fantastic movie, way better than this movie, but do you think I'm gonna show a hypothetical gay teenager the ""17 year old boy falls in love with a 26 year old guy and then gets abandoned by him"" movie? No, I'm gonna show this hypothetical gay kid ""Love, Simon"" because it's about him and there's no morally ambiguous relationships in it, just pleasant, uncontroversial (as uncontroversial as it can be in this world) gay romance. You don't get that in mainstream Hollywood, until now!Now if you want a big, award winning feat in filmmaking, this isn't it. Everything was passable; dialogue, acting, cinematography, nothing 'bad' but nothing to write home about. But this movie just by its nature is important, and if this film is successful in the mainstream market, it could set a new standard for LGBT representation in film, which is exactly what we should want.","Love, Simon"

I frankly hated (no joke) roughly the first third to half of ""Love, Simon,"" but, when more depth and consequences of actions are portrayed in the second half of the film I became engaged and loved it, up to and including the ending, which is as sweet and touching a conclusion as you hope for in a rom-com. I realize this is meant to be an homage to 80's teen films, so I tried to forgive the too-pat, flat, one-dimensional stereotypical characters frenetically surrounding the more grounded Simon (and there are far too many of them for you to have time to remember or care about), but the snarky, too-cool, and ""clever"" dialogue really got to me, and the film lost me for that first period. But then the consequences of Simon's selfish and, well, ultimately cruel actions toward his loving friends and family kicked in, and the resulting scenes swept me up and delivered me nicely to that sweet ending. I would likely watch this again, but with the awareness that I'd be enduring the first half (the equivalent of fingernails screeching on a blackboard) because it builds to a very satisfying second-half and conclusion. Worth viewing, but not the film I'd hoped it would be when I saw the clever and fun trailers for months prior to opening.","Love, Simon"

105,mauriciofernandogerhardt,Hate Simon,1,30 May 2018,"SPOILER: 
Story:
average, plain, boring, mediocre white male Simon has only 3 charateristics that stop him from getting the ""most boring character ever"" award: He's gay, a coward, and is surrounded by the extremely supportive and loving friends and family.
Since everyone around him is so supportive he's at no risk of ""coming out"", because you can obviously see that everyone is going to keep loving him no matter what.
But he doesn't. 
Then another gay person at his high school sort of comes out anonymously on the internet, in a chat room that apparently all of his high school reads.
So the coward starts chatting to him by creating a fake email.
But he's stupid enough to have his emails screenshotted by (deus ex machina) the weirdest and evilest teen male who just happens (deus ex machina) to like a girl that he's friends with, so he blackmails the coward into helping him get the girl.
The coward instead of denying such request, manipulates his friends in order to get the evil boy with his girl friend, because he's such a spineless coward.
Evil boy gets shot down by said girl.
Evil boy, for no good reason (deus ex machina), decides to then leak all the emails of the coward and his other anonymous gay friend.
Friends and family want to help support him, but he only cares about his ""relationship"" with the anonymous gay.
 The very next day (deus ex machina), the friends realize they've been manipulated, and are angry at the coward boy.
Then, at cafeteria, gay boy is harassed for being gay, and not only does his friends do nothing about it, but the coward now (deus ex machina) has all the courage in the world to face the bullies. Then the exemplary teacher says the bullies are going to get suspended for a very very long time (yeah right).
Coward boy now also has the courage to post openly about being gay on the internet, and says ""sorry for being bad, friends"", and ""i'm goin to be riding the ferris wheel such and such time and place, and want you anonymous gay guy to come with me"".
Then the anonymous gay guy goes and they have the courage to make out (first kiss!) in front of all these other students from his high school (as if no one would feel shy or awkward in such a situation).
The story deserves a zero, but the soundtrack is actually good, so I attribute the one star to that.","Love, Simon"

I suppose you couldn't make a gay movie without at least kissing. Why is it that if it was 2 gay girls I wouldn't have been as nauseated. Perhaps people put themselves in the picture.

113,ChristianLeFeuvre,"Stunningly good teen romance, with a refreshing difference.",10,20 March 2019,"Love, Simon is a stunning teen-romance movie, but with a difference.
Starring Nick Robinson as Simon Spier, a high school teenager with a happy home life, a family who care about him and good friends, but he also has a secret and is understandably concerned that if he tells this secret to his family his life will never be the same, and that secret is that he's gay.
He's never 'come out', never told anyone about it, but he's known for a while, and when he develops an online relationship with another student from the same high school, who is also gay but hasn't come out yet, he gets the courage to finally do things he was always afraid to do. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the identity of the student he has fallen for, apart from his nickname in the emails and chats, 'Blue', and the journey Simon takes to resolve all these issues and find out who it is, proves to be funny, life-changing and incredibly touching.
I didn't know anything about this movie, not even what it was about. I was recommended it by a family member and went into it completely blind. I didn't watch any trailers or read anything about it, and one of my main praises for the film is the fact that this is a mainstream teen romance movie told from the perspective of a gay man, and this is incredibly rare. But don't think that is the only reason this film is good, yes a major studio has made a film of this subject, but there are so many other reasons this film is such a beautiful and genuinely incredible movie. It's extremely well written, very well acted and brilliantly directed.
Nick Robinson gives a stunning performance, painfully real and doesn't come across as over the top or in any way stereotypical. This is also a major plus of the film, and all credit to the writing and direction that it doesn't set out to make us feel sorry for the character, it's just asking us to relate to him.
We've all had struggles in life, either at school, work or even dating, we've all had to work through things possibly being worried or frightened to tell anyone about it and this is what makes us relate to Simon in this film, we see his struggles and know that even if it isn't the same situation, we understand the feelings and emotions behind them.
I loved this film for so many reasons. It takes its time, this may be a downside for some who like their teen romance movies to move along, to do the big reveal early then have the rest of the film just move along developing the relationship between the two main characters, Love, Simon doesn't do this, and for me that was refreshing.
In today's world, I am sure that everyone has experience in online dating, and this is the heart of this film. Simon has started this online relationship but doesn't know who the other guy is, he knows its someone from his school and he's trying to figure out which one it is. There are some great scenes where he is subtly investigating and these scenes provide a mystery to the movie which is so good.
I found nearly every character in this film had realism, you could understand and appreciate everything about them. Apart from, and this is one of my 'niggles' about the film, the main antagonist Martin, a kid at the school who does some seriously awful things. I was disappointed by how the movie just seemed to gloss over them and the impact these things have on people. His actions are damaging and traumatise our lead character and his friends, through sly snooping he discovers Simon's secret and blackmails him and the film seems to just brush it aside, which for me felt wrong and a bit lazy. Martin does get a stern talking to at the end, but I think the film should have paid more attention as to how dangerous his actions were, especially considering how relatable the movie is to real life.
My other niggle is very petty but it is just one line in the film that I thought...'Ummm actually, no I don't think so'. In the opening montage, Simon says 'My life is just like yours, except for this one big secret', and then we see his stunning home, beautiful well-to-do family dynamic and I thought, hold on I'm not sure your life is just like the majority of the viewers.
I know it's a daft 'niggle', but this just goes to show how good the film actually is, to find fault in it was so tough all I could comment on is this line at the beginning of the film, and the way the writers dealt with the actions of the main antagonist, other than that, I genuinely couldn't find fault.
It's a charming, funny and touching movie with amazing performances and I would recommend it to everyone.","Love, Simon"

What you do and where you live. Everyone deserves equal love and happiness. This movie showed us the struggles, the anxiety, families, friends, the sadness and the loneliness that many gay people go through. It also showed us happiness, fun moments, love and laughter.
This movie is all about HOPE. Hope that it can get better and there are hope. This is one of the best movies that I have seen. You get a better understanding about gay people and their lives. Their struggles and what they go through etc. Of course not all live this kind of life, but you get a better understanding.

I have never been to any ""gay type"" event in my life. Nor a single party, parade, even some diversity or minority thing. I am not homophobic now. I say now because I grew up in a very homophobic environment, especially during Junior High and High School. The good thing though is that, I was never supportive neither disapproving of it. I just thought, gay things are meant for gay people. Religious people go to their churches or temples, single people to singles' bar and gay people to gay places. Eventually, everybody bumps each other, mostly at work and, as long as everybody keeps a professional behavior, OK. But this movie showed something that most of us, straight people. have a problem understanding, which is when someone ""becomes gay""? When dos the gay bug bite? it should be out there, maybe it is, the truth is I hope life becomes less of a burden to gay people. I still don't get a couple of things but I am a changed person on this. Not because this movie in particular but this movie helped.

120,DJKwa,"Love, Simon is more likely to be remembered for what (or rather who) it represents rather than what it achieves",7,11 March 2018,"Every generation has its own coming of age story. For kids growing up in the ""plugged in"" age, Love, Simon will prove to be a relatable look at high school life at a time when nothing stays hidden for long online. With the web at their fingertips, rumours spread like wildfire and secrets are shared quicker than a game of Chinese whispers. In Simon Spier's (Nick Robinson) case, his secret is that he's gay. The story follows Simon after a fellow closeted classmate comes out online under the pseudonym 'Blue'. Tracking down Blue's email address, Simon reaches out to him using his own alias and, under the shield of anonymity, the two quickly become digital pen pals. Sharing their thoughts and feelings with each other, things start to get complicated after Simon realises he might be falling in love with Blue and starts attempting to uncover his identity. Part of the film's fun is guessing along with Simon who Blue may be. To keep audiences on their toes, the film adopts numerous narrators for Blue and this playfulness keeps the film engaging even when it feels familiar. Moreover, the film's genuine portrayal of gay teen romance feels like a watershed moment for the well-worn coming of age narrative. A gay protagonist coming to terms with his sexuality like any other teen will speak strongly to an underrepresented audience and the film recognises this prerogative. At the same time, the film's success lies in its ability to find the shared moments of humour and heart that will appeal to all audiences, irrespective of their gender or sexual orientation.Unfortunately, the film goes for grand gestures when dealing with Simon's complex feelings and a few scenes feel excessively Hollywood-ised as a result. Most egregious is the films' climactic scene where, without giving much away, Simon stages a public forum for his anonymous pen pal to reveal his identity. It's played as a heroic moment for Simon that he's come to terms with his sexuality and is willing to publicly fall in love. However, the over-the-top way the scene plays out is like something you'd see at the end of a hackneyed love story, and it doesn't get a free pass here just because it's a gay love story.Still, much like Simon himself, the film is frequently funny, charming and easy going. It's also fronted by a strong cast of young actors who work convincingly as a tight-nit group of friends who go through their own emotional dramas rather than simply serving as emotional support for Simon. Ultimately, Love, Simon is more likely to be remembered for what (or rather who) it represents rather than what it achieves. The story is far from groundbreaking, but maybe its adherence to formula is a message in and of itself, that straight or gay, love is all the same.","Love, Simon"
121,ryanbartlett-870-746486,An Unexpected Hit,7,25 March 2018,"The movie was advertised as a coming of age, teen comedy. Good for another romantic comedy that could produce a few good laughs. However, this movie wasn't a teen comedy at all. Was there humor? Yes, but it was mainly there so that you wouldn't cry yourself to sleep later that night. 
 Love, Simon brought together the strengths of each person who helped create it and provided a good take on what coming out as gay feels like. This movie reminded me constantly of the hit Netflix series ""Thirteen Reasons Why"", and not just because Katherine Langford is a main character. The film tried to explore the cause and effect that coming out has on someone. Built in with the secret emails that he confines his fears in, the movie almost tethers to the back of ""13 reasons why"" and rides its success. 
In that sense, it wasn't completely unique. However, it is on the forefront of the new genre of gay films that are starting to pop up. And with a mix of actors that are experienced and have bright futures, and a director who has a mass experience with working with teens to achieve his vision. Love, Simon is sure to succeed in theatres and the public. The best film, no. But one that will be a public favorite.
Other pros include the soundtrack of The Bleachers but I know that is just a personal bias, but their soundtrack as well as the score of the film was definitely a driving force in the mood of the film. From highs and lows the movie kept the audience engaged. There was laughter when it was getting too intense and emotional, yet not too much laughter to lose all emotion. Love, Simon found a happy medium and formula for success, that won't push any boundaries, doesn't show anything too particularly new, but it makes a good movie that showcases a newer subject. Fitting for audiences, but not for Oscars.","Love, Simon"
122,adam-may-bower,Over-Hyped,6,2 June 2018,"'Love, Simon' may be an enjoyable coming-of-age film, but it misses the mark of being a great film due to the fact that it is too simple and uninspired. The characters felt cheaply written, with no real depth, and the protagonist was not as likable as one should be in this genre. The plot itself was rather predictable and had one of the most unrealistic endings that came off as ridiculous. The movies attempt to normalise the gay community and portray them as no different to the straight community, yet undermines itself by constantly stereotyping the LGBTQI community, again and again, ultimately contradicting the key message trying to be shown. I also find it rather misleading to portray a coming out narrative as so blasé and nonchalant, when for many individuals, this is certainly not the case. However, all of this is not too say this is a bad film. Many critics and people have expressed all the great things about this film, so I decided to focus more on the negatives. But, there are certainly good things worthy of mention. It has a great cast, with Nick Robinson, Alexandra Shipp and Jennifer Garner being the highlights in the film. The humor in it is fine, with many laugh-out-loud moments but not many of them are memorable (excluding a hilarious and cringe-worthy reference to Grindr). This film certainly attempts to appeal to the millennial generation, with it's many references to pop-culture such as Hamilton, Buzzfeed and Trump references; and it certainly succeeds to a certain extent; the audience will be able to relate to the society it reflects. However, the film ultimately lacks to create a relatable narrative; but rather an unrealistic and misleading one.","Love, Simon"

And I couldn't wait that long for its Singapore release.But I had the chance of watching this movie during my vacation in New York the same week it opened. And I'm glad that I did.For a start, I was also blown away by the reception of the audience at the end of the movie. It's quite refreshing to see how the audiences reacted cheerfully. I mean coming from a Singapore society I can say that many of us (me including) watching a movie such as this would rather keep the cheering to ourselves and be quiet about it. But in New York, it was quite uplifting to see the audiences actually loving it even the elder generations who watched it.I'd describe the movie as sweet and tender. But at the same time, it's a feel-good movie that is rare in a LGBT movie which are usually given the tragic treatment with someone dying or parting ways, etc. But LOVE, SIMON gave a refreshing look at the typical teenager's life today. It's simple yet realistic of how coming out as a gay man is still a huge issue for anyone.Alonso Duralde (of The Wire and a panel at ""What The Flick"") called it a John Hughes movie for this generation which I agree. I mean LOVE, SIMON had all the embodiments of that typical teenage life for the contemporary generation but still have all the emotions and sentiments of teenagers in any generation but with the gay teenager as its main protagonist.If last year we had buzz going on about Timothee Chalamet and his breakout role in CALL ME BY YOUR NAME then this would be the year that Nick Robinson takes over that role in LOVE, SIMON.In short, I love this movie that I intend to buy it on Blu-ray when it hits the stores.","Love, Simon"

He is burdened by this secret so much so, that he stops being himself. Even though he is surrounded by an amazing family and equally amazing friends. His struggle is more internal and any of us could relate to that. My heart went out to him, every time. When he starts to interact with 'Blue' as 'Jacques' his burden is somewhat relieved. They encourage each other to be free, to be brave and to have the courage to accept oneself. What started as two people with one thing in common transforms into love, which is frankly one of the most refreshingly innocent and endearing love stories I have come across. I was rooting for them all the way.I loved the adults in this movie, From the teachers to the parents. They are all supportive and kind with no judgement what so ever. The two conversations he has with his parents made me cry. His mother's declaration of him being finally free and his father's heartfelt confession. They give him the courage to finally come out on his terms. How awesome is that??.Simon's story starts out with a huge secret, he falls in love on the way and finds the courage to be himself. His story ends with him being himself and free, with a pretty sweet boyfriend and an awesome love story. Surrounded by his family and friends. It's a pretty inspiring story, isn't it??.It is this inspiring story which makes this movie so awesome. Acceptance and love shouldn't have any discrimination.

126,pokedom,"Cute, but that's about it.",6,1 April 2018,"Part of me really wants to scream from the rooftops that the world is right in loving this movie. But I'm holding that back to talk about how the film is, as a film. It's not worth giving every movie with a positive message and cute moments a 10/10. Film doesn't work like that. By this logic Geostorm is a godsend of a movie. And we all know how that went.Let's go with the good. I think that yes, this movie is quite cute. Most of the dialogue is pretty great. Even the emotional moments toward the end are pretty good. The actors have a lot to work with, and aside from some moments that don't work, they try a good amount. It's interesting to see how the world is fairly similar to the real world, with believable dialogue and predictable teenage behavior.I think the message of the movie is nice. Being gay is totally fine, and seeing this kid grow throughout the course of the movie is fitting. He's just an average guy, a little shy, and gay, but hasn't told anyone yet. So he just goes through life, staying with his friends, being himself. There's some good moments in here that fit, and the coming out scenes are handled very well. The ending is extremely adorable as well. I won't say anything specific, but bring tissues if you are not strong willed.That being said, despite how I like the acting, the dialogue, and the message... I think this movie has a lot of horrible cliche stuff that just doesn't work at all. The leads are romantically involved, but they aren't gonna say anything about it. The kids all hang out in Drama class. The one guy threatens to leak information if he doesn't get the girl with the help of the lead. Does it sound like I'm describing Love, Simon? Or am I describing every high school rom-com you've ever seen? Really the only twist here is the lead is gay and it seems the rest aren't. I dunno, halfway through it felt like the girl who secretly liked Simon was actually gay too.The bully characters- they're not even characters. They have maybe 5 lines. And they're only there to be the ""homophobic anchors"" and pull off one really obnoxious scene where the kind and understanding Drama teacher (of course it was the Drama teacher) roasts them in front of the whole school. They're not even offensive, if I saw ""bullies"" like that at my school I'd just laugh at them, not with them. They get roasted every time they make an offensive joke anyways. You could literally take them out and *nothing* would change. It's just another cliche that doesn't need to be there.The ""antagonist"" is really really dumb. He just accidentally stumbles across Simon's conversations and uses it as blackmail. He does realize that being gay is a touchy subject right? He has no real consideration, doesn't even hesitate when blackmailing. The movie treats him as pure evil with one goal: to get someone to like him. A special someone... could this get any cheesier? I think if I sprayed cheese over the screen it'd still not be as cheesy. Really? This is yandare at it's finest, except when she denies him. Like he does everything right and she says no. So what does he do? Leaks the emails! Take your rage out on the guy who was only trying to help you win! Really??? Like Simon gave him the advice, he took it, and when she says no, he just does something so inconsiderate and bad you can't understand what he was thinking. Simon had nothing to do with some other girl saying no to you. Don't take it out on him... he's the Baby Driver himself. (Really look at the two... jeez...)So yes, this movie is fine. It's not nearly as good as everyone is praising it as, at least to me. I think there are parts that are extremely great, and parts that are absolutely awful. If you can look past some of the cliches and fully immerse yourself in the movie, and the good stuff about it, good on you. You absolutely have the right to enjoy it and love it. Don't let me and my nagging keep you down.","Love, Simon"
127,mkquinn91,"A Very ""Meh"" Movie",5,2 September 2018,"It's a comedy-drama that isn't very funny, and isn't very dramatic. Inoffensive, but not very enjoyable, with the feel of a high-budget TV movie.","Love, Simon"
128,florisklaver76,Important but superficial.,6,1 June 2018,"Being a gay male I welcome all LGBT movies with open arms. Especially the ones made for a big audience like this. It is still very much needed to make the masses understand what it is it like for young gay people to come out.This movie is an enjoyable watch and gives an idea of what it's like for a person to come out to the world with all ups and downs involved. However, the characters are not well developed and because of that the story really misses dept. Nick Robinson as Simon is not convincing, I am not sure if he is gay in real life but he did not come across as a believable gay person even though he is a good actor.In my opinion this movie only scratches the surface of what it is like for gay teens to grow up in a straight world and struggling to come out. And because of that it ends up as a mediocre teen movie. Not bad at all, but a lot of missed potential.","Love, Simon"
129,michaelmouse1,A 'Straight' attempt at a Gay film. Fair but not great.,6,9 June 2018,"Major film studios just can't seem to get 'Gay' right. Sure this movie has been a huge hit and it's thoroughly inoffensive - probably why mainstream audiences have embraced it- but it's far from honest. All the production values are neatly in place to guarantee success...cute main actor, above average casting and acting, good soundtrack, adequate screenplay, leaves its audience smiling. But it avoids homosexual intimacy at all costs. God forbid there'd be any sexual contact, even if in passing. This film avoids offending anyone so much it ends up an emotional void. The screenplay construct is oddly confusing- making the lead character almost the villain but he clearly is not. A nod to homophobes in the audience, perhaps? Gotta give them a hook after all! It's just dumb, needless and simply unbelievable. Why not present a Gay character who isn't necessarily seriously flawed? Because big studios simply won't stand for that.
If you want to see a far superior film watch Netflix's ""ALEX STRANGELOVE""- it is everything this film isn't...honest, true-to-life,equally funny and moving and will leave you feeling you've just watched something very real. 'Love Simon' is another small step for big studios giving both LGBTQI audiences and non-soecific audiences a story they can vaguely relate to. But ultimately it's a bit of fluff and popcorn. We all deserve much better.","Love, Simon"
130,ikizdevran-882-254684,He's done keeping his story straight.,8,4 August 2018,"If I need to use three words to explain ""Love, Simon,"" I would say beautiful, beautiful and beautiful. It is such a simple, easy and inspiring story. Just for the sake of making a point, you don't need to complicate things. Make it simple with a powerful message. This film shows us, simple things can be excessively nice. ""Love, Simon"" seems to be a film about a gay teenager who struggles with his secret because of the pressure of the society, but the film is actually much more than that. It is about all the people who are different than the society, who struggle to fit in, who fail to understand its rules and who have tough time to obey. Most of the time, once again because of the rotten society, its people and its rules, different people think something is wrong with them, and when they don't have the necessary support from their friends and society, they commit suicide or develop self-hate. Films like ""Love, Simon"" encourages this kind of people, who are not accepted by the society, or who think they will not be accepted by the society, to think there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. ""Love, Simon"" shows the power of cinema over people. While delivering a powerful message, it also uses an incredibly simple story and language. This film is for everyone. It is for friends, family, people, young or old. It is sharing a universal message. If there is one negative thing to say about ""Love, Simon,"" it is the fact that in real life these struggles may not be solved that easy. Thanks to Simon's awesome friends and family, he gets over the fact that he is gay easily, but imagine a contra-scenario where his family wouldn't accept such a thing, or if he wasn't welcomed by his family, then what do you think would have happened? World is not about America, there are societies who are socially and culturally way behind them, and in those countries, there are people with secrets too. I'm pretty sure that ""Love, Simon"" is banned in some countries.""Love, Simon"" is eligible for competing in the 91st Academy Awards. In my opinion it will have nominations for at least two categories. Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Nick Robinson, and Best Motion Picture of the Year. I have always wanted to watch critically-acclaimed films in advance, and guess about their nominations, this way I am able to test my knowledge about cinema. Anyway, getting back to the film, ""Love, Simon"" shows the entire world that a teenager film doesn't need to be stupid and meaningless and only about sex and getting laid. I like the facial expressional and overall performance of Nick Robinson. His performance makes all the difference when combined with this delightful story. Director of the film Greg Berlanti is a very experienced producer but it is not easy to say the same thing when it comes to directing. Before ""Love, Simon"" he was the director of The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy and Life as We Know It. However, you might have heard his name as the producer of TV series The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and Arrow if you are interested in Superhero TV Series. I am not, that's why I haven't heard of him until now, but I must say that, as a director of ""Love, Simon,"" he did a very good job. Conversations are up to date and relevant, he doesn't interfere in the story too much and manages to harmonize all the positive components of the film, like the story, performances, situations, reactions and atmosphere. He knows how to get the very best out of an actor.The comma between Love and Simon makes a huge difference. Because in the story, protagonist falls in love with another gay colleague with whom he exchanges mails, and he always signs the mail by saying Love, Jacques, which means Simon in French. Without the comma the name turns out to be Love Simon, but Simon doesn't need anybody's love because he is strong enough by himself. This film is said to be the first film by a major Hollywood studio to focus on a gay teenage romance, but I have to say that ""Love, Simon"" is not a gay romance. It is a film of self-struggle and standing up for yourself. There is no romance between gay people in the film, I mean this is not the purpose of ""Love, Simon"" to be understood as a production about gay people. Because it is not. ""Love, Simon"" is one of the best films of 2018 and a very useful one too, in the means of creating public awareness. I had a lot of fun watching it.","Love, Simon"
131,robert-85923,A very ordinary Rom Com with an Important Difference,9,16 May 2018,"In many way this is such a stock standard pot boiler of a rom com. You know the drill: boy meets girl, then boy loses girl because of the intervention of some idiot, boy overcomes idiot and gets girl and everyone lives happily ever after. It's the sort of saccharine sweet story that Hollywood churns out in the hundreds. But it has an important difference: the hero is gay and so the story goes boy meets boy... etc. This is such a departure for a Hollywood movie that it makes a stale format compelling. Despite the lead character being gay this is definitely not a ""gay"" film: it's very mainstream and ""mature"" family friendly (unless you're rabidly anti-LGBTI). The issue of ""coming out"" is covered sensitively, relevantly and realistically and the story line is competently handled. Casting and acting are all unremarkable as is setting and filming. Apart from the leading being gay, there is very little that jars in this film.Despite its very ordinariness this film is a groundbreaker and worth watching for that alone.","Love, Simon"
132,stephenbishop-22925,What a beautiful film,9,29 December 2018,"I watched this on my flight to Vancouver. What a beautiful, well made, well scripted film.
Nick Robinson is perfect in the role of the main protagonist, Simon, who has not come out and keeps it secret that he is gay. That is, until one of his school friends does it for him on the school forum.
You then have the sometimes hilarious antics of Simon trying to find out just who the other gay guy is in his school who he has been talking to by email.
The film is believable, and you just want him to be happy and find love.

133,rahmmie,Just Okay,6,9 January 2019,"This is one of those movies that meets the requirements but nothing more. It was textbook filmmaking, with the closet gay kid, the cool friends, the rich parents and lifestyle, and the big reveal at the end.

134,blob-93964,A good important movie.,8,13 September 2018,"This is a good movie, it's an important movie and i believe everyone should see it but i think it would have worked better and would have had more of an impact if two things were different. Firstly if the lead role of Simon was played by someone else, i didn't find Nick Robinson too convincing as his face is rather expressionless, he didn't convey anywhere near the emotion that i was hoping for and didn't feel overly moved by any of it. Secondly it should have been an independant movie instead of a typical Hollywood teen movie as i found it was shrouded in gushy cheese which it didn't need to be. This gave it an unrealistic feel which i felt made the film less important than it should be. On that note the film plays out almost identicly to Never Been Kissed with Drew Barrymore, especially with the ridiculous cringeworthy ending, which was sweet but toe curling at the same time. The real stars of the film were his parents, Jennifer Garner and especially Josh Duhamel played their parts perfectly and were totally believable as the unsuspecting yet supportive parents. All in all this is a great movie but it didn't pull on my heartstrings as much as i'd hoped.","Love, Simon"

139,Iusedtobeacat,7.7 Are you kidding me?,4,15 January 2019,"This movie was such a snoozefest. I have no idea how it generated such a high rating on IMDB.This is nothing but your average cookie cutter of a high school/teen movie, you could literally swap Simon's character and his identity as a homosexual with anything else and it wouldn't take out much of the plot.Rich and privileged white boy, living in a luxurious mansion with liberal parents. Liberal high school educators, and accepting friends freaks out, why? Because, he is a closeted homosexual and is scared of coming out even though he knows nothing bad would happen. His head won't get chopped off, his parents won't disown him, his friends won't make fun of him .. everything will be fine yet he feels scared. Then one supporting character, stumbles upon his secret and blackmails him ...... fast foward sometime later, his secret is of course revealed and throw in some complication with his friends and some minor bullying and then viola.. Simon redeems himself, his friends are content with him again, his family accepts him, he finds love and his classmates don't care about his sexual orientation..The end!Now, I don't know about you but I never saw that coming! ""sarcasm""I didn't care about Simon or his issues, because he had no real stakes anyways. Maybe, you could change the setting to a less accepting environment of gays and then it would make for a much more compelling story. Simon's sexual orientation had no qualms or significant consequences either ways which made the story just too passive.","Love, Simon"

142,ChipperX,Simon Gets An 'A' For Effort - But...,7,16 March 2018,"Love, Simon (2018).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq. Simon Spier (Nick Robinson) is an average high school senior and thespian with a devoted mother (Jennifer Garner), a hip father (Josh Duhamel) and a sweet younger sister (Talitha Eliana Bateman). Simon's three friends are intelligent, witty and kind. The only thing different about Simon is the fact that he's gay and in the closet - and no one knows his secret.Director Greg Berlanti (Green Lantern), with writers Elizabeth Berger, Isaac Aptaker and Becky Albertalli deliver a finished product which is heavy on the saccharine and low in citrus. It's nearly impossible to be offended by Simon - and that's partially due to the film's family-oriented vibe and uber-safe atmosphere. Ultimately, this film is likely to offend no one. But is that a good thing? Robinson's Simon is what every young man should wish to be - but there is definitely something missing in his delivery. He's funny, he's handsome, he's sweet and he's likable - but Robison, true sexuality notwithstanding, simply doesn't add enough fire to the character of Simon, and not for one instant did I find him credible as a closeted gay teenager with a huge-ass secret. The directing and writing for Love, Simon were acceptable, if a bit timid in delivery, but the movie as a whole fails to excite or compel. The supporting actors were all capable, and the cinematography was fine - but a true coming of age story this is not. Simon is an entertaining movie in small spurts, but when taken as a whole, this film is utterly devoid of suspense, drama, excitement and intrigue. Everyone involved gave it their best, but Simon was just too weak to keep me from yawning.","Love, Simon"
143,albertusjohannesmaria,Lovely movie,9,14 June 2018,"This movie touched me deep. Simon gets so much support when he comes out, the support I never got, not from friends, neighter from family. The attitude towards gays has so much changed for the better since I came out in 1984, which was 4 years after high school. Back then in the 70s it was totally impossible to come out, for me at least on the countryside in the Netherlands. Gays were regarded as less then a dog, really. Words like f****t were daily common terms of abuse. I was bullied for 6 long years. I can only be very happy society has made huge progress. Gay rights are at a level mankind has never seen before and we should be proud of that.","Love, Simon"

Just doesn't play as believable in 2018. That being said, kudos to all involved for giving it the old high school try and largely succeeding. (P.S. Where it failed big time was the musical fantasy sequence where Simon is leading a big number about what it means to be gay. I found that offensive to the max.

Over-sexualizing teachers (such as having them yell about sex and getting their tubes tied) as well as forcing in words like ""lit"", really take you out of the film and wonder what they were thinking.

Friendship. Duchewads. Finding love. Losing love. Family dynamics. Coming out decisions. And more. While I watched the movie with zero expectations, I found myself viewing it as a parent. Maybe because I am a parent. But this is my first parent goggles incident. My heart broke for this kid wondering if he came out, would his family and friends still love him. It hurts to believe there are people still like that. And his families reaction created a flood of tears in my eyes. The movie has many 1980's moments. Every now and then I felt like I was watching a bad 80's teen flick. This made the movie that much better for me (a 80's baby)! The antagonist of the film played the role well.

It plays like the best of the John Hughes films from the 80's. The only criticism (which cost it one star in my rating) is that some of the actors playing the teens are clearly in their mid 20's (and older!) which at a few times in the film takes you out of the action. Unfortunately this is true for many movies and is perhaps an unavoidable ""pothole"" that many if not most teen dramedies/movies suffer from.Other than that, everything about this film rings so true. The apprehension Simon feels; the agony of first crush/love; the script couldn't be better in capturing today's youth/young adults; it's all very good.Another plus is that is stays very close to the book on which it is used ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"" (although like nearly every movie based on YA fiction, the book is better - so no harm, no foul)If you haven't seem this movie, buy/rent it, sit down with a box of Halloween Oreos, your significant other, (gay or straight) and a box of Kleenex (you'll need it!) 9 out of 10 stars, hands down!","Love, Simon"

157,sugarnspices,"PG 13, Corney, but pretty satisfying",5,15 December 2018,"So I thought this movie was pretty cute and sweet, but that's about the extent of it.This is now the 4th or 5th movie/show I've seen centering around modern day teenagers and it just doesn't seem believeable, at all. The moody music at all times, from artists nobody has heard of. Not to mention they all are always in their mid-twenties (but they've been making movies like that forever.) Also, their interests and vocabulary is so unrealistic, it's like listening to a group of colllege kids at a bleed blue university coffee shop, taking themselves way too seriously and being almost purposely deep and edgy. Not saying there aren't teenagers like this, but mass majority are not, and that's all they seem to make teenage characters anymore in these Hollywood movies/shows.Speaking of shows, it honestly felt like 13 Reason Why - Hannah Baker's Prequel. Was pretty much the same character, and surroundings (including the moody music from bands these kids would have no clue about.) They even through in Alex, too. It's just 13 Reasons Why without the rape, drugs and suicide. This is the sunshine high school version.Bullies? Lame and pointless other than to have at least one or two people to be against being gay, since every single other person was immediately accepting and didn't bat an eye. Which is another thing, I'm just not seeing the struggle or battle for Simon. He has a cookie cutter life, family, house, friends, etc. etc. Other than being embarrassed and scared of change, they really didn't hit home with what most young people really deal with when coming out.Overall, it's a good movie, good for high schoolers. For anyone over the age of 18 and has seen and heard the real struggles of the gay community, it's a little too cookie cutter to be really moved or inspired.","Love, Simon"
158,Yee_Reviews,A Film Filled With Heart and Charm,7,11 March 2018,"Good: The cast does an amazing job overall and at times feels realistic, but Nick Robinson is the standout and acts like a genuine high school student dealing with a problem without going over the top. Robinson's family and friends work well with each other and have a connection. The writing and direction from Greg Berlanti make the film feel fresh even if it appears to be another teen romance. The film is filled with a lot of emotion and heart. The movie is paced evenly with its entertaining, comedic, and emotional moments.Bad: Although the writing is very well done, I do not agree with some of the plot points that do occur. 
Nitpicking: A few jokes fall flat and the principal just becomes a source of comedic relief and does not benefit the story.Overall: I will say that ""Call Me By Your Name"" is a better film overall, but ""Love, Simon"" has heart and wit and provides for an enjoyable watch. For a high school student, this movie can be relatable by showing the struggles of having a crush or secret and how it affects others. I hope more commercial films will start to produce more coming-of-age films instead of indie films always being the go-to when it comes to seeing great teen dramas. 3.75/5","Love, Simon"

162,hakrames,A refreshing high school coming of age film,9,18 March 2018,"Love, Simon is about a senior in high school who has a very good life, happily married parents who love him and his younger sister; a great group of friends who all care about him in varying ways; and a big secret he hasn't told anyone, Simon is gay. And through meeting some anonymous person on a local social media site coming out as gay he ends up emailing and communicating with this stranger trying to figure out who he is while concealing his huge secret.Love, Simon; is one of those movies that will be talked about by multiple different age groups about its storytelling and unique characters. And it deserves the praise it'll hopefully get. This is a beautiful film about a young boy coming out of the closet and the nervousness that can come from it in today's generation and society. The direction of this movie is amazing, nothing to me felt pushed at all, it felt fluent and natural for the cast and each scene transferred amazingly with it's tone change and different emotions that have gone into it. Also the way each and every character is presented doesn't feel pushed and even the guessing of who is the 'mystery email person' doesn't feel to predictable. I honestly didn't know who it was by the end of the film and that was a huge plus in my eyes on the film. The writing in this film is perfect. Since this is also a comedy, every joke in the film hit extremely well and came out at the perfect moments too. And each casting for each character for the script they got was perfect. I loved every character in the film, and hated a few for who they were but not because they weren't bad at it. The one negative is two characters in the film didn't get fully fleshed out like the way I would have liked, they were very one sided which fit for the film but it's my one negative on the writing of the film. The acting and cast though was amazing. Nick Robinson (Jurassic World) did by far his best performance in his career here as Simon. And with the combination of fantastic writing and his great acting skills, he was able to make his character so relatable without almost forcing the audience to like him. I loved his character just because he was so relatable to me, and his morals and upbringing was so nice to see. Not having this character that came from a broken family or something tragic, no he was just a normal teen who was just trying to figure out his life and what to do with his secret and the secret emailer. The only two things I can say negative about the film is I wished they told the audience what his parents did more specifically and not graze over it so quickly. And the one sided characters that had roughly three scenes in the film. Love, Simon gets a 9.25/10","Love, Simon"

Throughout the movie, I kept wondering why a well-adjusted normal kid, would have such a hard time coming out today and was frustrated by his actions throughout the movie, but, like another character in the movie, I realized it's not about how I feel or what I would do. It was Simon's choice. Period.

BUT....,9,4 February 2020,"At first, I thought this movie was just another over-hyped movie that was probably mediocre at best.I loved this movie so very much, and it totally deserves ALL of the hype.BUT...I still enjoyed the book more and here's why:The book definitely had more instances where Simon had encounters with Blue without knowing it and that what made the book so great! Once you figured out who Blue was every part that had him in it made you yell at the pages trying to get Simon to hear you.Also, I distinctly remember Leah and Simon's sister being in an all girl band, yet that scene is completely omitted from the movie.What got me the most during the movie was when Jennifer Garner's character is talking to Simon and she says ""You get to exhale now Simon. You get to be more you than you've been in a very long time.""Gahhhh, so good.So, while I do take issue with some of the things in Love, Simon that's just because I prefer the book more.

I want to feel scare, embarrassed, excite, thrilled, these are the feelings we all went through at that stage of our live. I never felt like that watching this film. I didn't worried, I was never concerned, there was not one moment where I didn't believe that everything would all work out.

Aussie Katherine Langford and her questionable American accent tries way to hard it's actually painful to watch sometimes..
And the others, I can't remember because the acting wasn't good..You've tried, very poorly, to make it into a 80's John Hughes style comedy and just stuck a gay teen in, and it fails miserably..I can see why it could be popular but it could have been made so much better..I've read the book and its good.. I don't know what they were trying to do here..It felt cheaply made, not funny at all.. and very predictable..If you are looking for something a bit more realistic and credible, for the LGBTQ community, there are a few films out there that are well made and more understandable than this trash I'm afraid..","Love, Simon"
173,thesandman-886-18472,Martin is a disaster why didn't he get revenge?,3,3 July 2021,So in this movie it's about a kid coming out as being gay and he lives like in a luxurious house of white people who make a ton of money and doesn't have it that bad and society has liberal parents which obviously are going to accept him for being gay. Martin is a horrible human being who basically destroyed him on the Internet and he knew it was him the thing that frustrates me the most is when he made that post to get this kid to go out with him on a Ferris wheel to make out because he was in love with him what annoys me is why didn't he destroy Martin on the Internet? Get back at him call him a loser for trying to go out with that girl who obviously is out of his league make fun of his hair like seriously you sometimes have to be little and destroy someone's so badly that they will never ever mess with you ever again and I was really hoping for that and that's the part that I really didn't like about the movie I thought this gay kid was going to destroy Martin online and he didn't very disappointing movie I wanted to see that horrible kid get destroyed he is the devil and he deserves it..Also it's so painfully obvious that the black kid was obviously in to Simon I mean come on even though I'm autistic I can tell that he was hinting it.Like when he brought up Oreos and then brought up the Halloween ones that are the best he said that in a anonymous chat room how can people not connect the dots it was so easily obvious that it was him I could totally towel even the way he was looking at them at the cafeteria when they ate together you could clearly tell he was into him this was such a pointless movie it's so predictable it's terrible.,"Love, Simon"
174,michaeledward1212,Made For Straights,5,25 March 2018,"Love, Simon is Hollywood's first attempt at a wide release gay film, and going into the film I was expecting something along the lines of a gay romcom, instead I got a watered down and unrealistic portrayal of coming out and the gay experience in general, which left me wondering how many LGBT people were behind the camera, and frankly in front of it. The movie has been called a modern John Hughes-esque film, but it completely lacks the sense of humor and depth to be compared to the likes of great 80s teen movies. Simon Spear (Nick Robinson), our protagonist has an admittedly perfect life, and just happens to be gay, which he has kept a secret his whole life, and no one, including his doting liberal family or open-minded friends he's known since childhood have suspected anything at all. Right there I felt I was being asked to suspend my disbelief just a little bit too far, I would guess that a family like Simon's, especially his mother who is seen making a sign that says down with the heteropatriarchy would have at least had a talk with her kids once or twice about homosexuality and how she wouldn't love her children any less if they happened to be gay. Simon's friend group consists of Leah (Katherine Langford), Ally (Alexandra Shipp), and painfully underdeveloped Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) who is defined by little else than his love of soccer. The gang is introduced when Simon picks them each up from school, but the groups interaction reads as contrived and unnatural, and I kept thinking that I was watching an advertisement instead of a teen movie. My next issue with Love, Simon is exemplified by the high school itself.We meet Ethan (Clark Moore) the only out gay at Simon's school who is black, gay and feminine, and plays a relatively insignificant role in the film overall. The way they portray Ethan's coming out is that it was easy and almost unnecessary due to his stereotypical traits, which is borderline insulting and again undermines the coming out process of gender non-conforming queer people, which the movie would seemingly prefer not to dwell on in favor of their white, upper middle-class and ""normal"" straight acting protagonist. The teachers at Simon's school are all over the top and out of place in a movie that aims for a semi-realistic portrayal of the gay experience. Both the vice principal and theatre teacher seem like they belong in a surreal teen sitcom with their antics and behaviors, most of which fell flat. The last act of the movie is when I basically checked out. Simon's coming out is involuntary, and he has no control of it, which makes it less satisfying when he tells his family, because it's already a forgone conclusion that they'll find out. Seemingly, Simon's entire school, including friend group have turned against him after his outing for various reasons and he manages to change their minds by posting a message on a popular school gossip site, which is used by every student in the school, or so they would like you to believe, and the finale scene on the ferries wheel must have taken place in a completely alternate universe because there's no way a big school like Simon's would care so much about two gay people meeting up in public. The movie gives us one gay kiss at the end, which is probably ten less than the average romcom or teen comedy, but because it's a gay movie they can probably only get away with one and still keep it PG-13. The whole movie just felt artificial and staged, as well as contrived, as none of the events that force Simon to come out of the closet ring true whatsoever. Overall, I think this movie is a step in the right direction, but definitely not one of the better LGBT movies of the last few years. The best scenes include a montage of straight kids coming out to their parents, and Keiynan Lonsdale's performance.Other gripes: The timeline of the movie is wonky, it starts at the beginning of the school year and goes into the end where graduation is now approaching, but this makes many events in the movie nonsensical. Why did Simon's dad (Josh Duhamel) spend seven months working on an anniversary video for his wife? Why did the school spend most of the year preparing for one show? The timeline takes some of the intensity out of Simon's pen pal relationship with Blue, which would've been much more intense if it took place over the course of a month or so. Also, the scene where Simon is fantasizing about being gay and in college is borderline homophobic and is there basically to show the audience that Simon is gay, but not that gay, a message that is insulting to the gay rights movement and everyone who fought to make movies like this possible.","Love, Simon"

Hopefully when I have kids myself I hope they don't have any of what the main actor in this movie went through and hope they can just be open!Let's hope they make a Love, Simon 2 and I can't recommend this movie enough!","Love, Simon"

Let's get on into the positives:Acting was superb. Jennifer Garner and the man who plays Simon's dad do excellent work. The friend is great. The bully is a figure to behold( the actor, not the actual character.) But it really is Nick Robinson's movie. his portrayal of Simon can go from sad to joyful to empathetic in the blink of an eye. Did I mention Tony Hale? One of the most underrated actors in hollywood.-The story was awesome. It is a very realistic portrayal of what it is like to go through these events and the consequences surrounding it.-Entertainment Value was probably the film's highlight. It is 109 minutes and it goes by like the flash.Overall Love, Simon is a perfect movie. Highly recommend and hopefully it does well not just domestically, but overseas too.An A+ for sure, or on an IMDb scale, 10/10!","Love, Simon"

179,pp312,Needs more grit. A truckload actually.,2,13 January 2019,"This movie is surprisingly unrealistic. It comes across as an updating of the old Father Knows Best TV series, for those who remember. I notice one of the screenwriters and the novelist is a woman. Sorry to sound sexist, but I found that whenever women write about young males (Adrian Mole comes to mind) the result is totally unconvincing, however cute some people many find it. This movie never for a moment suggests real life. Everyone is either upbeat to the point of being irritating...or just irritating with no particular personality. The true angst of being a gay teenager is never suggested (I was one, so I know). The reality of perpetual concealment never rears its ugly head. Simon happily sings out to young males in the street, smiles openly at a boy waiter in the restaurant, and is even stupid enough to let a friend see his gay emails. Is he suffering in any way? Doesn't appear so . No, sorry, I'm not particularly into gritty movies, but this one definitely needs a lot more grit before it will pass muster as anything approaching reality.","Love, Simon"
180,SmashandNasty,Sets the bar incredibly high for the modern high-school movie,9,13 March 2018,"Simon (Nick Robinson) hasn't told anyone his deep dark secret: he's gay. One day, a classmate reveals anonymously on an online message board that he's also closeted, Simon finds a friend and confidant. This American romantic teen dramedy is based on the young adult novel, Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda follows Simon as he attempts to balance adolescence, his new pen pal, his friends, and the possibility of being forcibly outed to the world.Our take: See it in theaters.
Post credit scene? No.Love, Simon is a coming-of-age-while-coming-out movie and it has all the elements of an instant classic. It's touching, heartwarming and refreshing view at the awkwardness of navigating high school - and will pull at even the most cynical viewers' heartstrings. Rarely does a movie so effortlessly combine knee-slapping humor and poignant, tear-jerking authenticity. This movie recycles some of the oldest tropes in the book in a fresh way and sets the bar incredibly high for the modern high-school movie.Robinson is a standout, but there is not a single weak performance in the film. From 13 Reasons Why Golden Globe-nominee Katherine Langford's to the Flash's Keiynan Lonsdale each actor is believable and relatable. Whether high school is an ongoing saga for you, or it's been a decade since you set foot in a classroom - this film has something in it for everyone.This movie was also aggressively marketed in clever and captivating ways. Other studios ought to take note of the outstanding push this film has gotten in the months leading up to its release because it's been stellar. Overall, it's a film that's enjoyable enough to see in theaters multiple times (and purchase the DVD) - and it's relevant and necessary in a world filled with heteronormative love stories.Featuring: Jennifer Garner's continued seamless transition into the cool movie mom.","Love, Simon"
181,silverturquoise,"At last, Simon",9,17 March 2018,"I liked the way this movie used the anonymous email exchanges between Blue and Jacques as a way of conceptualizing what it's like to be in hiding about your true identity. I think it was a really powerful vehicle as Simon saw various clues and thought several different guys could be Blue. The script revealed how loving family members and friends make assumptions about identity through the various jokes and comments that were clearly missing the mark with Simon. I think this movie sends a powerful and positive message that is long overdue. There are so many teens across the world who stay in hiding like Simon did at the beginning of the film. Even in the most liberal of places, teens are cruel and hateful to any kid that is not uber heterosexual, and adults look the other way. I hope the film inspires more validation and acceptance.","Love, Simon"

I enjoyed every minute of it, the acting was brilliant from all but I especially liked the actor who played Simon, Nick Robinson.Love, Simon is about a teenager keeping a secret from his friends and family. What makes this such a special film is you can really relate to Simon. The problems he deals with are what we all had to deal with growing up... regardless of what his secret is. Nick Robinson does this so well and I will be going out of my way to watch more films he's starred in, excellent actor! And a new favorite of mine.I was moved by many of the scenes of this film but particularly the one with his mother. Jennifer Garner is a lovely actress and she is so believable with her heartfelt speech to Simon, I feel tearful even writing about it. Wonderful scene!I liked all the characters and was glad Simon's group of friends weren't too cutesy or quirky.

186,sarahrayburn,Heartwarming story but too predictable,5,9 November 2021,"This story follows Simon, a lovable character in his teens with a huge secret, that he is gay. I really liked the story and Simon was a very great character and well portrayed, but the rest of the film fell flat due to overplayed clichés and ultimately predictable plot. The movies whole climate culminates to ""who is the mystery gay kid that Simon has fallen in love with but hasn't met?"" I saw who it was coming from a mile away, even when the film tries to make you think otherwise. This was too distracting to simply enjoy what was taking place. I believe the story and message are so important and it should be watched for that, but it is not a top level film by any means.","Love, Simon"
187,VVMini,"A little too sweet, but well worth watching",7,3 June 2018,"The movie ""Love, Simon"", like the book, excels most at the authentic portrayal of an average gay teen trying to come to terms with his sexuality. It seems like there's a new wave of gay movies coming along in which it is no longer about the abuse one gets from others for being gay, but rather the struggles that go along with discovering and expressing your sexuality, even if you know that your family and friends are going to be completely fine with it. Rather than the fear of hate, the fear of change is already a very powerful repellent against coming out. It's the reason I have waited to well past my teens to do it myself, and even now I'm still not very public about it.So the message and overall tone of the movie and book is something that speaks to me very well. The actors all did a great job, and the movie was quirky and genuinely funny at times, and completely denounced of any cynicism. Some of the scenes at the end also struck an emotional cord with me, particularly the interactions between Simon and his parents. While they weren't as poetic as ""Call Me By Your Name""'s ending speech, they were a lot more grounded and authentic and as equally welcome for any gay kid. That being said, I do believe both the book and the movie delve a little too deeply into candy-covered Hollywood cheesy sweetness. It checks all the regular teen dramedy boxes and while the gay angle is quite original and refreshing, not a whole lot else of the movie is. There's the usual teen romantic drama and tensions between friends , an excentric vice-principal, drama class, a sassy drama teacher, and a sickeningly sweet ending that is a little too over the top feel-good to actually feel very good. It lacks that little edge and rawness to give it a sense of realism, instead of feeling like a fictional book/Hollywood fabrication. So although Love, Simon doesn't do anything to advance the genre of romantic teen dramedies, it is a welcome addition to (gay) cinema, if only for being a small mainstream hit that helps increase awareness and representation of your average gay person.","Love, Simon"

192,pniemeyer-47222,"Good, but sanitized",7,12 April 2018,"I'm going to be a bit of a naysayer here, in that I liked this movie, just not quite as much as some of the other users did. This is Hollywood's first mainstream gay teen rom-com, and as such, it does somewhat sanitize the experience of coming out and finding love. Even then, there's a lot to like here. Nick Robinson is great in a role that asks him to run the gamut of emotions, and the direction and soundtrack all do a great job of conveying his torment and eventual triumph.The plot, for those who don't know: Simon is a closeted teenager with a loving family and friends who would almost certainly be fine with it if they know his big secret. Yet somehow, he can't bring himself to tell them. One day, an anonymous post on his school's blog leads to his becoming email pals with another closeted student. He finds himself developing feelings for this kid even though he doesn't know his name or what he looks like. Then Martin, an obnoxious straight boy, sees the emails and threatens to out Simon unless he helps him get with one of Simon's female friends. Simon reluctantly complies.If you've seen John Hughes movies, you probably know most of the tropes here. Simon's internal conflict will be familiar to many viewers. He's not so much afraid of telling people that he is gay so much as he resents having to come out in the first place. Without giving anything away, I will say that the film does an effective job of universalizing that conflict in a way that straight people will be able to empathize with. Both Simon and Martin do things that people in their position would at least consider. The film doesn't let Martin off the hook, nor does it outright condemn him.That said, I don't think the film goes far enough. Being in a closet can turn a person inside out, and even after you come out, you often find that the people who think they understand don't. Homophobia exists everywhere, even in the most progressive communities, and it runs a little deeper than this film cares to acknowledge. Even LGBT people can be homophobes, and they make a habit of preying on young people who think everyone who is like them is their friend. The book that inspired this film only mentioned this in passing. The film gives our hero an uplifting ending, but I think he has more than a couple of rude surprises in his future. And I don't think his friends quite heard him out at a crucial moment.Of course, much of my criticism can be explained away by simply saying that that's how Hollywood do. Hollywood has always shied away from showing the unvarnished truth of anything, so I give ""Love, Simon"" credit for getting more right than not. I don't believe that the climactic scene at the Ferris wheel would ever happen in real life, but you can say that about a lot of movies. In some ways, this movie is groundbreaking. In other ways, it plays it safe. I hope that I have given you an accurate impression of its strengths and weaknesses. If you see it, you will definitely feel something. You might check out some of the artists on the soundtrack as well. Just remember that we have a ways to go.","Love, Simon"

He should have just told his friends first that he is gay. He did said that he has a normal life and no bashing gay friends and family. I dont know why he had a hard time coming out.... most teenagers can be pretty stupid... i dont recommend this movie, unless you have a really low iq. Again im not a homophobe. I 100% support the lgbt community. If you want to get married to the same sex. Be my guess, ill be there for you. But this movie was so stupid.","Love, Simon"

196,mlvclg1,"Ummmm, wait a minute?!",5,24 March 2018,"This was very well acted, but how is this movie relateable with the straightest actor playing a closeted gay kid, family accepts his coming out ""perfectly"", and the struggles in school are minimal???","Love, Simon"
197,AyanaH,Not what I hoped it would be,6,10 June 2018,"I'll start by saying that this isn't a bad film. It's watchable and necessary in the sense that it's a huge step forward in normalizing LGBTQ+ representation in mainstream cinema. I for one never assumed that it would open in my hyper-religious, homophobic country and yet it did, for all of two weeks.However, what I had expected to be a charming coming-of-age/coming out film didn't really deliver, or rather it delivered but withheld the charm. I'm not one of those people who raises a fuss when a movie doesn't live up to the book it's based on. If the movie is good, regardless of the changes made, I can still appreciate and enjoy it.
But with ""Love, Simon"" I felt like everything that made the book dynamic and unique was lacking in the film and so I can't help but compare them. Whereas it seemed like the writer made sure not to portray overly stereotypical characters, the film went with the usual, predictable John Hughes-esque teen tropes that we've been inundated with for decades. The best example would be the character of Nick. In the book he's a popular soccer player who says very little and disappears into his own world whenever he's playing guitar. He's crushing on a girl but doesn't actively pursue her. In the movie, he constantly runs his mouth, cracking jokes like he'll die if he takes a minute to breathe and the reason I find this problematic is because they made the decision of making the character a POC and as a POC myself, I'm tired of always seeing us portrayed as loud-mouthed braggarts. Or, in Abby's case, who is also POC, educating the ""ignorant white folks"" about hip-hop culture and the like. For a film as innovative as this was meant to be, I guess they only felt the need to tackle one form of representation at a time.
Also, where the book managed to make you see the humanity in/feel some sympathy for the blackmailer Martin, the film character, once again, was as cliche as you could possibly get.Now I'll get to Simon himself. I've never had a problem with Nick Robinson in anything I've seen him in but I don't feel like he really tapped into the emotional depth of the character. Part of the reason this happened, I believe, is that the writers basically had him looking for ""Blue"" in every guy he met, to the point that he even asked a couple of them if they were Blue. It didn't feel like he was looking for THE Blue so much as A Blue: as if ANY Blue would do. It ruined the mystery and sense of, I don't know, possessive safe-keeping that the book had. Blue was his special secret, his person, not a name to be spoken aloud and to guys whose gazes only lingered on his for a few extra seconds no less. Book Simon wanted badly to meet Blue but for the majority of the book he cherished their online relationship more than his growing feelings and desires and he understood Blue's reluctance to come out and did his utmost not to out him.
I suppose this doesn't matter much since there was no mystery to Blue's identity to begin with. They made it obvious from the get-go who he actually was. He may as well have been wearing a stamp on his forehead.Another huge mistake that the movie made is the big public reveal. In the book, Simon told Blue through their usual form of communication that he'd be waiting for him on the ride. When Blue did show up, there was no huge spectacle. He didn't come out to the entire school the same time he revealed himself to Simon. In fact there was hardly anyone around. It made it all the more special and intimate.So in summation, I guess my biggest gripe with the film is that it took something that was fresh and touching, gave it the Hollywood treatment and made it into yet another teen movie, only with a gay lead. I suppose as far as normalizing gay cinema, they're on the right track in that respect. No special treatment there. But it could have been so much more than that and since I really looked forward to it, I regret that it wasn't.","Love, Simon"

200,denny321,"Cute, Sweet, but Ultimately Flat",7,18 March 2018,"The premise is good and I enjoyed the film overall, but there were way too many places where I thought to myself, they really should have done a better job. It seemed to me they tried too hard in some parts, and not nearly hard enough in others.The most mystifying choice of all to me was the timeline. The movie opens in October of Simon's senior year in high school, and ends shortly before graduation. I assume this mirrors the source novel (""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"") and intends to take the characters on an epic journey through a succession of major high school events: Halloween, football season, Christmas, etc. But there just isn't enough story in the screenplay to fill that span of time. Dragging out the material that fits into 109 minutes over a seven month timeline seriously detracts from the film's credibility as well as the characters' integrity.Simon is plausibly terrified at the prospect of being outed to his classmates and family - even in this day and age it's more the rule than the exception, and it's good to see this dealt with on screen, particularly in a film intended for a mainstream audience. It's very scary for a teenager to realize his life isn't going to be what he thought it was ""supposed"" to be, especially in the midst of the herd mentality of high school, where misfits are summarily rejected. But the steps he takes to hide his sexual identity from his best friends, while easily chalked up to teenage insecurity if they played out over a week or two, become unconscionably bad behavior when drawn out over two months. As a result, when he finally is outed he becomes a pariah to his classmates and friends for pretty much all of the remaining five months of the timeline - a long time for lifelong friends to stay angry even under the circumstances without appearing to be completely heartless, and a long time for poor Simon to have nothing to do but mope around and be miserable. To be honest, Simon's social exile is the best part of the film, since his emotional anguish plays very real and provides some genuinely heartwarming and heart-rending moments. But moping around from Christmas until May is a bit too overwhelming.Meanwhile, they're finally preparing to stage that school play they've been rehearsing since October - seriously, does any high school drama club rehearse a play for seven months? And the football team is still holding practices. In May. Long season, huh guys?I can only imagine the novel contains enough material to fill out the timeline in a way that satisfies the reader. But given the constraints of a screenplay it would have felt much more true to life, and had a much greater emotional impact, if the timeline had been condensed into a month or so. Dragging this story out for nearly an entire school year robs it of the sense of urgency that the film medium can deliver so well.Bottom line, I think it's great that the film was made, and is giving mainstream audiences an appreciation of some of the issues faced by gay teens. I'd recommend it to anyone. But in the end I can't help thinking about how easily it could have been made so much better.","Love, Simon"

My opinion is this movie has that score because nowadays everything related to gay issues and so on has more value than any other things.
The movie itself is not a bad movie, don't get me wrong but for 8.0 is clearly overrated taking into account that the only special thing is that Simon is gay.

207,beybeykestrel,One Core Value: Love,8,4 June 2018,"I think this film can stand for the situation of the LGBTs in the campus in 2017-2018. It also contains the multi-ethnic imagination to the students, including the white, the black and the Jewish etc. Though these political-correct elements act usually in our sight, they still convey one core value: Love. We can see Simon is born in a happy family and grows up ordinarily into a simple boy as we can encounter in the street. When he comes out, his family gives him the full LOVE to let him to be self-confident to face with everything. His teacher also gives him a hand. And his friends and classmates comes back to support him. Such a cute and youthful story. The whole film-making is not showy but plain. Some jokes lie in the common conversations and make people laugh out. The rhythm of this film is also just the right amount.

I wish this movie had been around when I was 17/18 and completely mixed up. All I had to relate too was Queer As Folk ( the Uk tv series ) and that was not relatable to me at all. 
I think the secret to Love Simon's success is that it's authentic with well rounded characters that are relatable to people . The film is lead by Nick Robinson (Jurassic World ) who turns in a fantastic performance with subtle nuances that make Simon a well rounded character.
This isn't an indie film , no one dies of AIDS, or sleeps around , there's no tragic accidents, it's just perfectly normal .

220,banana-05888,I Was Blown Away,10,11 March 2019,"So, I normally don't write reviews on IMDB. I've watched a lot of movies, and while I wouldn't say that this is the best movie I've ever seen, I think a lot of what is captured in this movie is very realistic to our present. There are many reviewers who say that this movie is not realistic for several reasons: why would a teenager be that close with their parents? Why would a teenager wait for someone on top of a Ferris wheel? Why would a teenager fall in love and only commmunicate with someone I've the internet?Well, just because it didn't happen to you does not mean it didn't happen to someone else. I am someone who was/is very close to their parents, even as a teenager. The Ferris wheel scene is TOTALLY something I would have done as a grand gesture in high school. And I communicated with my husband only through text messages for the first full month we were talking (I had seen him before but still!!)I am not a lesbian, but I am a very big ally for the LGBTQIA community. I remember when I first saw two men as partners on a design show in the 4th grade, and I asked my mother why there were two men that were so close. When she told me that they were together, my response was something along the lines of ""Aww. That's so sweet."" Any time one of my friends or relatives has come out to me as gay, I've made sure to make them feel at ease and to help them realize that that part of them does not change how I perceive them. Who you love should not change who you are.That was the most powerful thing I got from this movie. Simon knew who he was. He wasn't afraid of being gay; he was afraid that people would stop viewing him as Simon. When we have kids in the future, if one of them is gay/lesbian/bi/trans/etc, I hope that they never feel like they have to hide that part of themselves because they worry about that changing who they are to me. They will still be my son or daughter.I know that this film is not indicative of every coming out story, and I am so sorry for those who did not have a supportive coming out experience. I wish I could send you all of my love and let you know that any negative reactions you received does not dictate who you are. I was just happy to finally see a film that showed a much more positive outcome for someone coming out. I am hopeful that this will bring more LGBTQIA stories to our cinemas and TV screens.","Love, Simon"

222,jameshatfield-77323,"Honestly, I'm so glad I read the book first",6,28 December 2020,"If I watched the film before reading the book, I probably wouldn't have bothered. In the book Blue's identity is kept secret until the last 50 pages or so, with subtle hints, some of which are misleading. In the film his identity is revealed explicitly 25 minutes in. Then there's that annoying teacher who talks to students about his tinder hookups, which no real teacher would ever do without getting fired and Martin's character is so unlikable in the film, in the book the whole point was everyone except Simon liked him, but here he's just annoying and awful and creepy.The book felt so realistic and really resonated with me, being a gay teenager who is struggling to come out, and the film just didn't do it justice.","Love, Simon"
223,crussell444,Gut Wrenching,10,16 April 2018,"This movie appears to be a typical high school fluff film. But when one student comes out anonymously as gay and Simon connects with him via email things begin to change.
I know it may be difficult for many young people to understand the anguish of being gay in today's society but sadly it still can be. And Simon;'s coming to grip with his gayness and reaching out to the anonymous gay young man slowly builds to a point where he is outed by another boy suffering a different disappointment.
Fortunately his family is supportive, but he loses the support of his friends and is, for a time, mocked by fellow classmates.
Ultimately his honesty and acceptance of his identity works to his advantage which makes for a happy ending. This ties the movie up nicely. If only in real life could endings be this happy.

225,Artbrute,Hard times,4,11 June 2018,"This could have been a great film! What I really disliked about it is that the viewer is treated as a short sighted with a narrow mind, for instance, in the end when one of the characters says ""I am black and Jewish"". Yes, we had understood that by the time it is said. 
I liked the way the main character has a specific taste in music and is a person with a certain amount of culture and education. That should have been focused and emphasised! 
I thought it was silly the conversation with the mother (unsuitable for the role, seems like an older sister - poor acting, I guess). The same happened with the father. Time have changed, but feelings have not. 
The feeling I get is that everything was sort of predictable.
Are teachers in America like that? Do they get in hallways taking students phones? Do they take about their ""tubes""?
Why doesn't the film ends with the graduation or he writing an email? Simple but effective.
Films should move us, make us think, it is through culture that we grow and we mature ideas. I got none of that in this.","Love, Simon"

The main characters and Blue all exude some kind of magnetic chemistry that I can believe I am one of their friends.Of course, the ending is well-deserved after all that buildup and character development.Ultimately, this is like Wonder from 2017-- the movie that won't get nominated for Oscars because it is too ""light"" and ""fluffy"" but it really should because it represents a more optimistic side in a world that seems darker and darker every day.","Love, Simon"
233,jingren_98,One step forward...,10,24 June 2018,"This film is a change.It is on so many levels, most worthy of mentioning of course is how it was produced by 20th Century Fox, major Hollywood studio, despite it being a coming-of-age film centered on a gay teen protagonist. Therefore, this film truly is one step forward. One step forward in triggering change in the social, and hopefully, political, mindset of the LGBT community.However, there is more to do.The film is, for instance, rated Restricted 21 in Singapore, solely because of the homosexual theme of the story. Optimists may argue that it should be gratifying that the movie is being screened in Singapore. True. Be that as it may, speaking objectively, I have to put forth a different view.Rating the film at Restricted 21 directly hinders the very targeted effect of the film. The intended audience ranges from as young as the start of adolescence, if I may just suggest as such. The struggle of having an identity not accepted nor supported by society may come as early as a human being starting to exhibit cognitive capacity to communicate and to socialise. In that respect, this film needs one step forward.Nonetheless, due credit ought to be given to the creative contributors whose efforts put together made this film possible. From Becky, who wrote the book in the very first place, to Greg, whose directorial vision enlarged the written work into this enchanting visual experience, without any single one of them, the success of this film would have never came to fruition.In essence, more people need to see this film. More people need to understand what this film talks about. More people need to be inspired by this story.More people need to exhale.Love, JR.","Love, Simon"

236,VanillaCaramelLatte,Cute but flawed,6,8 September 2019,"Although I feel that I'm getting too old for teen movies, I always enjoy watching them. That's why I decided to stream the well praised Love, Simon this afternoon. First things first, Simon, is a senior in high school with loving parents and a stable group of friends. This guy has a completely ordinary life...Except that he is hiding a secret: He is gay.There's a blog where people from his school write (anonymously or not) gossip posts and confessions. One of them caught Simon's eye, as it was a message which addressed the same issue as Simon's: being closeted. He immediately emailed the guy, who only signed as Blue, and they soon start a conversation, which keeps going even though they remain unknown to each other.While using the school library's computer to answer one of Blue's emails, Simon is interrupted by the vice-principal and, trying to end their interaction, he goes away without logging off. Martin, a drama club classmate with poor social skills and weird nerdy behavior, comes to use the computer after Simon and ends up reading the whole conversation between the two.Martin is desperate to win Abby's, one of Simon's friends, attention, so he sees this as an opportunity to blackmail Simon and threatens to expose the emails if he doesn't help him accomplish that. From there, Simon tries his best to keep his sexuality from being revealed even if it means he has to act against his wishes. He also has to deal with confusing scenarios, his friends' love problems and above all, trying to figure out who Blue is and if they'd ever meet in person.So, I never have great expectations towards a teen movie in terms of being realistic. I know they're generally quite flawed and this was no exception. I think it would have been better if the teachers at Simon's school were not so over the top - I'm not American, but I'm sure they don't go around randomly talking to students in the hallways and taking phones away from their hands like the one in this movie did. Also the bullying situation in the cafeteria when the drama teacher intervene with an inappropriate posture and language made me cringe. I get that it's a movie and sometimes situations are exaggerated, but this could easily be avoided. It'd make no difference to the story if these two characters behaved normally.I was also confused by the whole shared blog thing as I've never encountered something like that in real life. But I get it - The two had to meet somewhere anonymously.Martin's character is way too much. I think it'd been more believable if instead of a bizarre kid the person who'd seen the emails was one of the bullies, who rarely made an appearance. Also, I don't think I'd forget to sign off my email account, specially regarding something as important as this.One thing that annoyed me in the beginning of the movie and that I've seen before is making family plans early in the day to do the more mundane of activities in the evening, in this case, watching TV. I mean... Do people really do this? But anyway, his parents are the cliché liberal parents who are caring and supportive but don't make a big deal if he sleeps in the same room with his female best friend and gets home drunk. I didn't dislike them (although Simon's dad jokes are terrible) but I feel that I've seen them before too many times. Yeah, that's one of the problems with teen movies.However, despite these flaws, Love, Simon has good intentions. I've seen other films with main gay characters but this is the first mainstream teen comedy to feature one and I think that's important and well fitted in today's society. The movie is very entertaining and although it become more obvious in the end, I liked how throughout the film they made it difficult to find out who Blue was. In general I enjoyed the characters and the acting. I recommend it for people who enjoy a cute teen movie from time to time!","Love, Simon"
237,bandara_jaya,"Love, Simon/ Love doesn't have a Gender",10,8 June 2018,"One of the movies which have wet my nose vessels. Which have tiered me up. 
Its too emotional and at the sometime it shares a good message to the world. 
I don't know whether how many of South Asian countries going to watch this movie and going to understand the meaning of this movie. 
After lots of struggles now most of the European Countries, Australia, UK and American Countries have accepted the LGBT relationships. In South Asian countries still the Homosexuals are struggling with Homophobia bullies. No one is able to come up and declare themselves with their real sexuality. I know many of them who are Gay, have married with a Woman and screwed up both their lives and their kids lives as well. 
This director has written the movie to show that, acceptance is the good goal every society should have and otherwise it will go in wrong direction. if one single person in the society can stand up against the Homophobia bullies then all the sexualities will fall in safe hands. 
I love the acting of Main two characters and i wish them best of luck for their career from bottom of my heart. and i salute to the directors and writers of this movie and you have done a real great job.","Love, Simon"
238,deveshmaisuria,This movie is different than you think it is,5,3 July 2018,"Love, Simon for me has to be a very decent movie but I would say that this not a good movie but in fact it's a decent film for the most part. Simon's character I think had a lot of focus to it as he kept chatting with this guy on the internet. He finds out that the person he's chatting to is also gay like him. He begins sharing his personal thoughts about who he is and what he wants to do. At this point I kind of got an idea that this movie does not really care about anything that is going on but it will just give you pointless scenes that don't have connection to with the movie itself.I would give this a 5/10 because I think that this movie didn't do what I expected it to be.

It touches on the challenges of coming out and even self discovery but more importantly this movie explains how much the LGBTQ community does literally hold themselves back in order to be kosher with the rest of society and how scary any ripples in the water can be. I feel like this movie perfectly encompassed just how delicate ones actions can be but also how challenging addressing something about ourselves that should be no different than our favorite color or type of music we like because we are all individuals.

Not necessarily all.The reviews saying this is inaccurate are saying this because they are selfish to the point of that they came out and it wasn't like this so it must be the same for everyone. No you are wrong. This movie is really well made and tells the story of what it is like down to a T. As I said, not the same story for everyone but it is for a hell of a lot.Sure as hell brought back a lot of memories.","Love, Simon"
248,josephcarloaquino,The movie adapted 60% of the novel,7,1 June 2018,"I've read the novel just a week after I got a copy of the movie and I could say the movie adapted around 60% of the novel. The novel's name if you don't know about it is 'Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda' by Becky Albertalli. Let's talk about the movie, the movie is good. It was smart, slow but there were no dull minutes and it was exciting. Nick Robinson had done a great job in portraying the character--felt like he was just the character I imagine in my head while I was reading the book. Although, what I didn't like was when they altered the part where the Leah (Katherine Langford) was supposed to be really in love with Nick not with SIMON. In a movie perspective, it looked cliche and everyone that haven't read the book could actually expect it since Leah (movie) act weird.","Love, Simon"

I was a little nervous because many movies have let me down contrary to their great trailers. HOWEVER, this movie blew my expectations out of the water. This movie left you guessing until the very end about who the secret messager is, who is Blue? I was so relieved to see that it was Bram (played by Keiynan Lonsdale) even watching the trailers I knew he would be a perfect love interest. Nick Robinson smashes the lead role and brings you to emotional highs and lows. Speaking of which brings me to Jennifer's Gardens speech probably the BEST lines of the movie, ""I could feel you holding your breath...you get to exhale now Simon"" literally still brings tears to my eyes. Even though you don't get to see the two love interest interact face to face until the last moments of the movie it still causes sparks and goosebumps. This is the most emotionally attached I've ever felt to a movie. I walked out of the theater so happy and full joy. This movie is so important and it definitely did an amazing job fulfilling the void of lgbt big budget movies!

But you can see in this movie that an orientation doesn't make so much difference. My point is we should try to reach a point that coming out shouldn't be a thing. We can live with and see each other as a human, nothing more.","Love, Simon"

While LGBTQ+ audiences have had independent, low budget films that cater to them for some time, this is the first film supported by a major studio that is about and marketed to LGBTQ+ teen audiences. It's so incredibly relevant and Nick Robinson's portrayal of Simon is so pitch-perfect that this will be iconic forever. He is straight in his personal life, but still somehow taps into the emotions I've had growing up gay all my life - and he conveys them so subtley and spot on. I resonate with this movie and character so much and I've never seen the moviegoing audience with me in the theater go so crazy! It's a must see - everything is amazing and perfect!!!","Love, Simon"

 My city has no less than 5 advance showings, with fewer than 25 to 50 people attending, though the promotional companies are not allowing many to attend in their far too few invitations, so they are to blame as to not seeming to care about promoting this LGBT film, sad. 
The atmosphere is quite sugary with no home challenges, and the stigma of the school still doesn't seem quite realistic enough, as there is only mild bullying at best.
The Vice Principal role is appealing. The weird guy who outs Simon, even after blackmailing him of his orientation, is left alone, not expelled or even more than one stern talking to, not actually believable; perhaps this film wants to convey a ""Christian"" atmosphere. If this is your reality then you shall like it.
 Sidenote: critical acclaim to the actress who begs ""Help me Jesus"" to the proper take on her daughter mocking modern society NOT taking the same view of Heterosexuals as they do towards LGBT.","Love, Simon"

It may pave way for many teens to be inspired about what they want to be and not become what others prefer you to be. It helps you feel better-and better than good to be comfortable in your own skin and be happy and proud about what-and WHO YOU ARE. You are a human with personal preferences and choices and you will never let other others give a f**k about you.
Berlanti is genius director and has managed to maintain the beautiful balance between happiness and pain. 
Nick Robinson is convincing as the sometimes fanatical and sometimes happy and sometimes anxious SIMON. He is more than just convincing. He adds more-much more to the hard-to-understand character.
And yeah Simon's friends are funny and sweet to.(Sorry I dont know the real actors' names!)
So Yeah this is a great film to be watched on happy weekends with your family and friends.

264,mollypennick,Incredible (don't read this if you aren't willing to listen),10,13 April 2018,"As a member of the LGBTQ+ community in their late teens I loved this movie.
I feel like some people have rated this around about a 5 or a 6 because they haven't looked at it from the perspective of someone like me and although I think their opinion is valid if you have a view similar to reviews like that please hear me out.Love, Simon follows the story of a 17 year old boy (played by Nick Robinson who did an amazing job by the way) who has figured out he is gay and is keeping it a secret. He starts messaging back and forth with another boy in his school who is gay. Both Simon and the boy keep their identities anonymous to each other until Simon gets outed and things change. It's full of moments of happiness and heartbreak.I am however not writing this review to explain the plot as there are many other reviews that will sum it up a lot better than I could with my limited writing ability but please hear me out on my view of it. I believe this film is necessary for people like me and around the same age as me. Yes people have difficult coming out stories but isn't it nice to watch one where people accept someone that's gay? The argument I've heard from people is that it's unrealistic however it still shows the emotions Simon feels of struggling to be who he is an the anxiety created by coming out. This movie's aim was to be a nice teen romance movie for gay people because it's what we deserve and if you want a movie that deals with a bad coming out story that's more ""realistic"" this isn't the movie for you. There are so many moments that LGBT people can relate to and it is amazing in helping the acceptance of people when they've come out as I've heard so many stories of it making it easier for people to come out to their parents and get the acceptance they deserve and that's what a great movie does. A great movie takes a topic that is important and turns it into something that people can connect with and stays on your mind after watching and this movie really does that.To conclude, it was the movie I needed and I thought about it for days after watching it and I know it'll stay as one of my favourite movies for a long time. It is, however, a movie you're going to want to bring tissues to go and see and maybe wear some waterproof mascara if you're a big cryer. Truly incredible and I cannot thank the people that created this movie enough.","Love, Simon"

First of all the guy who plays Simon is terrible at acting, sorry to say. He makes the character so unconvincing and boring. It's like he's not capable of showing any emotion whatsoever. And the casting? Awful. Literally I can't see how any of these characters could work as friends in real life. They have zero chemistry. And Leah, the supposed best friend is not nearly as relevant as she should be. As for the family, they would've at LEAST casted people who look alike because to me it feels like they just brought in a bunch of actors last minute and gave them the roles. And dear god, don't even get me started on the mystery lover. The two barely even engage in any deep conversations and they just decide that they love each other?

269,spongeval,"Not so great, and even worse if you have read the book",3,2 May 2021,"Tldr: The film is mediocre, and if you read the book (which is great), you will notice it even more. Simon and the rest of the characters are very well written in the book, and there's no room for tropes like the ""Easily Forgiven"" or ""Karma Houdini"" ones, unlike in the film.So I watched this film like 2 years ago or so, and I thought it was okeish. I initially gave it a 7, conscious that I was being very generous simply because it was a movie with LGBTQ+ thematic, and hence, I felt I had to support projects like this. But no, the film is not that great per se. The story is not very deep, and the characters are not so interesting. Mainly, the protagonist, Simon, is not a nice person. He is not a good example or a hero. He manipulates his friends, putting at risk their feelings and relationships - their happiness - all for egoistical interests. But all is forgiven at the end, because after all Simon is supposed to be a good guy that just took some ""small"" wrong decisions under pressure and, more importantly, did everything in the name of love. Awful message, common place, the contrary of what people need to believe is correct and good. You name it.Just yesterday I finished reading the book ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"" for the first time, and I loved it. The book is so good for many reasons, for example it is a good example for teenagers of how to act when you encounter certain emotional problematics. I watched the film again, today, thinking ""Why I don't remember this film as good one...?"" Well, turns out the film has small to do with the book, really. Simon, in the books, is an awesome person. He is not perfect, but no way he would manipulate his friends. The only thing he does in the book is inviting Martin to some activities that include Abby, nothing more. That's not the only difference between book-Simon and movie-Simon, but that's the one that annoyed me the most. And to be honest, all the characters in the film have very small connections (other than the names and a few details) to the characters in the book. The film and its characters are way two-dimensional, when the book is so rich. Martin is a joke in the film, when in the book he has motivations; he is not totally unlikeable, there's no room to enjoy how he fails and puts himself in ridicule (not that the scene even exists in the book). By the end of the book most of us can probably empathize with Martin feelings, at least a bit. And that's how you really write a good character.It's a shame this book was made into a film, where time is a problem and so much needs to be cut... But changing the characters that way, I really can't understand that, especially with Simon's case. Now the series ""Love, Victor"" is being made... And even if it's not as interesting as ""Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda"", at least there is more depth and the characters are not that flat. I wish they had made a series about Simon and Blue's story instead of this film.If you really want to know about this story, please read the book. It really deserves attention. But please, forget about this film.","Love, Simon"
270,ajholman1998,Perfectly pleasant but disappointingly average,6,7 January 2019,"Being an LGBT individual myself, I was very looking forward to the idea of a fresh and progressive new romantic comedy with a gay character as the primary lead and focus. However, upon reflection after watching this film, it is disappointingly average and fails to truly break any barriers at all. The film itself is highly pleasant and definitely watchable, but it only manages to make one smile rather than illicit any real deep emotional responses. This is because the actual content of the film is unfortunately safe and almost bordering on Utopian in its vision; it is free of any really controversial or subversive content in which a film of this genre really needs to stand out from the crowd. The film also suffers from an over abundance of high-school/teen-drama cliches which fail to elevate it to higher ground and render the film often feeling overly sentimental and even pretentious at times.
In terms of the film's story line, it unfortunately fails to create any real intrigue long-term interest and is incredibly uniform in its execution. The plot as most know concerns a closeted gay high-school student Simon, who ends up having on online relationship with an anonymous individual from his school in the same shoes, without knowing their identity; in other words, cat-fishing. The principal concept is executed well-enough, but is worth noting how problematic and dangerous it is for young people to engage in this behaviour. Luckily, Nick Robinson gives a surprisingly good performance as Simon, giving him emotional depth, likeability and most importantly, he is believable. Without him, the film is essentially nothing. The other cast are surprisingly decent, including Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel as his loving, liberal parents, and his group of three main friends are all decent individuals. Unfortunately, all these potentially great characters are underwritten, under-developed and some are hardly given any chance at dialogue, meaning these characters are rendered easily forgettable. However, other characters, especially the Vice-Principal, Martin and two school bullies/delinquents are very irritating and have no real purpose in the story. Martin in particular, a laughable clown who engages in emotional blackmail and even publicly outs Simon online after the failure of his plan to elope Simon's friend Abby, is a very pathetic excuse of an ""antagonist"", who fails to create any real tension or threat, and does not even receive face any consequences of his irresponsible actions. His overly passionate and nosy Vice Principal seems too gimmicky to be taken seriously, and the two male school bullies are so pathetic and useless as characters, that they do not even deserve screen time. Furthermore, the films overall execution is too safe and predictable; it is not hard to assume who the mystery ""blue"" figure is, and the ending is too far too sweet and sugary to leave you feeling even remotely interested about such privileged teens. Resolutions made between characters, in particular Simon and his friends after their fall out, seem very superficial and predictable; nothing reaches an honest or realistic conclusion.
The film's tone is also somewhat problematic. The film has a very breezy, cheerful and summery tone, but the picture it paints of Simon's life comes across as Utopian and quite superficial. Simon appears to be a very privileged and wealthy teenager with successful parents, who lives in a large house and lives in an idyllic neighbourhood, with fashionable friends, with an even more perfect high-school. Not there is nothing wrong with being privileged in the slightest, this depiction comes across as too sugary and almost confectionery, like a delicious and fancy birthday cake, that is lovely to eat, but leaves you wanting more and once it is gone, it is gone. This overly idyllic setting fails to depict the lead character in any real hardship or struggle, as there is none. Perhaps if the film had a more diverse social setting, more tension and interest would be generated, to experience how gay youngsters who do not have it all have to cope with coming out.
In spite of all these issues, Love Simon does have any positive aspects thankfully that make it watchable and simple entertainment. The cast, in particular Nick Robinson, is surprisingly strong who all give emotionally resonant performances. The film's portrayal of LGBT issues deserves much commending and praise, for its depictions of tolerance and liberal social attitudes, it definitely helps ease the taboos about coming out and shows LGBT feelings and relationship to be perfectly normal and natural, in which they are. The audience does also feel much sympathy and understanding of Simon's issues, and his easy going charisma as a character helps this immensely.
In conclusion, I feel this is a reasonably good LGBT film which very positively portrays LGBT issues very tastefully and tolerantly which is what we need to keep doing in the world today.

and it's all fine until it reaches the conflict, where his identity is threatened. now, it was a lil dull, but necessary for the last part where u get this crazy vibes and emotions going.

""Love,Simon"" perfectly approaches my view and thats why I really liked that movie.This movie shows how important is to be YOU! How important is to be supported by your friends and family. 
""Love,Simon"" is really beautiful and emotional lovestory.I need more movies like that!

It looked a little cheesy and stupid but it far exceeded my expectation.Although it seems that it would only appeal to a small teen based audience, this is a movie that people of all ages and tastes can find something they like in.The acting from every character is phenominal, from the main character Simon played by Nick Robinson, the best friend played by 13 Reasons Why actor Katherin Langford or even Simons father played by the amazingly talented Josh Duhamel who we havent seen given a chance to do a good job in movies like Transformers or Safe Haven.There are a few plot holes but they can be completely put out of mind when you are wrapped up in the beautiful story of Love, Simon. 9.2/10","Love, Simon"

At the beginning of the film I thought it was just another LGBT movies with a bad story, but I was shocked by the film with the power of screenplay and great acting.
This film made me cry and laugh at the same time.
Everything in the film was a wonderful directing and soundtrack, And this is not what I expect because what I have seen from movies that talk about LGBT was not at the level of the issue discussed by the movies ""except Brokeback Mountain"".""
In the end, Homosexuals is not a disease but something natural and beautiful.
and I hope filmmakers will produce films of this quality in the future that talk about and support LGBT issues'Everyone deserves a great love story'...love simon","Love, Simon"
275,mac139,More Disney than reality.,3,15 December 2018,"Very disappointed in this film,though not particularly surprised. American film makers don't do kid/teen movies very well, and this is no exception.
At no moment were any of the actors even remotely believable as any known, real life teenager. The fact that none of them were actually teenagers at filming is the first giveaway. 22 year old guys can't play 17,ever. But it goes well beyond that. The writing,sets, staging, all of it is such goopy homogenized pap, it suits a Saturday morning slot in the cartoon lineup.
The premise was smart, and beyond that a complete washout. What could have been a tremendous opportunity to tell a fun yet important story, instead falls completely flat. In the hands of a dozen or so European directors I can think of this could have been a terrific coming out tale, but I suspect none would take it on....they've done the coming out genre many times, all so much more successfully than this mush.","Love, Simon"
276,GabrielMarinho1,The importance of simple movies,7,29 March 2018,"Maybe the importance of this movie is bigger than the actual greatness here present. Working as a casual forbidden love story and familiar drama, we see the story of an average teenager struggling to deal with the truth about his sexuality, witch has been hidden for years. The emotional intensity during this movie reaches extremely exaggerated points, and the character's resolutions seem as confused as he is, even though both of these aspects aren't unexpected once this is a hollywoodian adaptation of a book directed to teenagers. Above its tripping development, the whole picture is very touching and alarming, and could be even greater without the last ten minutes, that are simply in there to make the tears that have been hanging in you eyes fall (not that it is really degrading to the movie at all, it's just my opinion that holding your breath after the credits and then crying reveals a preety much more unforgettable ending). After all, Love, Simon tells us to look to a different reality, and shows how close these stories are from us, and how tough they are even if the obstacles in it could be easily undone if people were a little bit more tolerant.","Love, Simon"

Knowing that the author loved the movie, I was very confident going into this. I was not disappointed one bit. The mystery of who Blue was constantly changing so it was almost impossible to guess who it was (though I already knew via the book) and it was wonderfully done. I myself am a bisexual teenager who has yet to come out to my family and this movie gives me the confidence to maybe do so. I just absolutely loved it. I laughed and teared up. The movie follows very closely to the book yet still has its interesting differences that keep it fresh. I highly suggest this movie. Please go see it. It is so worth it.","Love, Simon"

For much of time, its been this way.. and it's only just starting to improve. But, people still think that gay characters shouldn't be in their TV shows or movies for whatever reason.

I have very homophobic parents and I will have them watch this to softly but firmly and wonderfully make them more comfortable with gays. You can't show many ""gay movies"" to homophobic people but this is one of them, I wouldn't show take my wife or the L word to homophobic people like my parents but this is so perfect and in that note a lot of movies with gays are so much into the gayness that it becomes annoying as fuck (excuse the language) yes love, simon still revolves around him being gay but most movies like that make it so that I sometimes find it very annoying, love simon focused on the plot which revolves around being gay but was not annoying at all.

I have not heard of this film or the book series until I first watched the film on July 27, 2018. This film came ""out"" March 16, 2018. Ever since then I have been a fan of the Simonverse. This is the first film and romantic-comedy drama released by a major studio-20th Century Fox (Now 20th Century Studios after purchase by Disney) with a gay lead. This is the best romantic-comedy drama film I have ever seen and I have seen 100s. Great story, great music, great characters, great actors, great attention to detail, and overall great production. Everyone involved in Love, Simon has shown how amazing they get their job done. I will be enjoying Love, Simon and other Simonverse projects for the rest of my life. Including Love, Victor on Hulu which has been renewed for a second season. Everyone needs to watch this amazing film, so they can understand what other people have to go through to get their love story. Everyone deserves a great love story. This film and the tv show are based off the book by Becky Albertalli, ""Simon Vs. the Homo sapiens Agenda"". The book is a great read and I cannot wait to read all of her other books she has written. This world needs to be more inclusive no matter what we believe in spiritually.","Love, Simon"

I thought is was cute, but nothing special, and unrealistic. At the end, Simon and Blue are on the ferris wheel, and everyone starts cheering for them. That is not an accurate depiction of how teenagers act, 90% percent of them wouldn't be invested in what this theater kid was doing, no matter how cute it made the big moment. I think I would've enjoyed this movie if I liked rom-coms, but this is not the type of movie I typically like. So basically, this is a sweet movie if you are into cheesy films, which honestly, I completely get if you do, but it's not for me.","Love, Simon"

298,josejaviersaritmontalvo,High Expectations Met,10,11 March 2018,"Love, Simon is a heartwarming, honest and witty adaptation of Becky Albertalli's praised-worthy book. It is undeniable that Simon's story is a universal one that many people from all walks of life can relate to in one way or another. It is extremely difficult for book to film adaptations to translate properly, however, having read Simon Vs. The Homosapiens Agenda, I believe Love, Simon is a truthful adaption of such a beloved novel. The performances from the cast exceeded all expectations, especially Nick Robinson's portrayal of Simon. Kudos to Jennifer Garner, Josh Duhamel and especially Tony Hale and Natasha Rothwell who undoubtedly elevate this film to greater heights. The direction from Greg Berlanti should also be lauded as it is apparent this film wouldn't be what it is if it weren't for his vision. All in all, I am extremely happy I was able to see these characters that have lived in the pages of one of my favorite books come to life. A+","Love, Simon"

Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner (Simon's parents) were the only characters that seemed remotely real to me.

300,ognjenlukic96,I tried to like it,4,3 March 2019,"Well first of all I am a bisexual boy and second but also first, I read the book, i never heard of the title until the movie came out and I knew i had to read the book first, I got the book and it was beautiful, writing was amazing characters so vivid so honest, everything i hoped it would be, I rooted for Simon and i was in suspense the entire time who Blue was, so naturally i couldn't wait to see the movie, and I heard all the best about it so even tho i didn't want to have any expectations i assumed it would be good. And there it was the night i finally got to it and honestly i was sad, yeah sad, i would say that is the right word to use, to the people who read the book also and praised the book i ask why? how is this a good adaptation? good adaptation of the characters of the story of everything? they made so many stupid unnecessary changed, like the dog he had? why? Abby? why? than Martin?! this is one of the biggest question marks of all, martin with his overly annoying voice in the movie stupid haircut everything, they chanced so many things the story i knew wasn't there. And i understand that the movie can never the same as a book but come on this could have been so much better, and even if i didn't read the book the characters in the movie were so annoying the dialogue is so stupid and agh i just hate it. And literally to see everyone screaming HOW GOOD IT IS is just frustrating cuz ah lgbt is so cool now we stan a gay friend god forbid anyone said anything bad about the movie because everyone would just kill than person bc he isn't a lgbt ally how can anyone say anything bad about the movie when it's so good????!!! so yea hope i got my point across to anyone who ever reads this :)","Love, Simon"
301,lc_1996,A formulaic Hollywood coming-of-age story with some redeeming features,5,14 April 2018,"Apart from the fact that this is the first film from a major studio to feature a gay protagonist, there's nothing special about it. It's definitely over-praised but not necessarily a bad film and probably above average (depending on your perspective).My fears were confirmed from the beginning of the film: stale dialogue, excessive exposition, uninspiring cinematography and score. However, I felt the dialogue improved as the film progressed and I was never bored. Nick Robinson's performance in particular was very believable when he wasn't forced to say ridiculous things - I think the director and screenwriters could've gotten more out of his performance and I hope his acting career continues to progress. The characters of his three friends were poorly developed (if at all) and it seems all we know about their friendship is they like to drink iced coffee together. Likewise, his family is generic and uninteresting - it's pushed in our faces from the beginning that his younger sister fancies herself as a budding chef...how unique. Jennifer Garner was pretty bad. Also, the teachers are obnoxious and irresponsible.One of my favourite things about this film is that the central conflict wasn't brought about by generic bullies (who were still in the film) but by Martin. Martin is an outcast kid just trying to fit in and willing to do all kinds of inconsiderate and embarrassing things to gain the affections of a girl, even though he isn't a cruel person. I know teenage boys like him exist. I also liked the addition of a more femme and openly gay character (Ethan) to contrast with Simon's experience.Although the film needs to be judged independently of the book, the asinine deviations from the source material are fairly inexcusable and seem to mostly serve the formulaic plot rather than credible character motivations. On the other hand, some changes were positive. The film has a better title and I thought the Ferris wheel scene was far more powerful than Blue's reveal in the book, which fell a bit flat, and I was willing to suspend my disbelief that such a shy, closeted gay kid would out himself in front of a crowd of his peers.I have three main gripes with the adaptation. Firstly, it's hard to believe that a gay kid on the verge of coming out and after a night flirting with a crush would sneak off to kiss a girl in private without any apparent peer pressure. His lame excuse that he was 'confused' nearly ruined the Ferris wheel scene and it seems clear this was only a plot device to mask Blue's identity, rather than something a real person might do. I would've believed he might be compelled to return her attentions in front of peers in order to maintain a straight persona but why in private only to break it off immediately?Secondly, the revelation that Leah likes Simon instead of Nick could've been handled more delicately - these situations do happen in real life. However, upon learning Simon is gay, Leah selfishly decided to wallow in self pity rather than support her best friend when he needed it most, leaving him friendless because Abby and Nick decide they can't forgive Simon for caving into blackmail. To be fair, Simon inexplicably lied to Nick about Abby having a boyfriend, which is egregious but (once again) not credible - why make up such an obvious lie? In the book, Abby approached Simon about his more subtle deceptions but forgave him fairly quickly after she considered his predicament, as any good friend would. Nevertheless, none of his friends supported him when he was outed because they had their own trivial problems with him. This betrayal is simply forgotten after the Second Act, serving the Hollywood formula rather than emulating the behaviour of human beings with feelings.Thirdly, after Simon's emails to Blue are leaked by Martin, Bram deletes this email account, leaving Simon truly alone. This was an incredibly heartwrenching scene and a nice addition to the book. But why did Bram delete the email account? Nobody (including Simon) knew his identity from the emails. You might say it was to prevent others from emailing him but as he published this email address to the totally legit school blog along with his initial 'Ferris wheel' post, rather than the more sensible annonymous Tumblr post of the book, the email address was already public. So, (once again) this arose from a need to create tension rather than from credible character motivations.I think the director could've done a far better job with the film. He was handed fairly decent source material, a generous budget, capable actors (for the most part), and yet only managed to produce something slightly above mediocre. The tragedy of this film is that it could've been so much better.","Love, Simon"
302,nlbrownn,Absolutely Loved It,10,17 March 2018,"I literally went by myself to the movie because I was so excited to watch it...I always loved the actor who played Simon.

303,drorimor,Only LGBTs will truly understand,9,27 June 2018,"This movie touched so many soft spots that make me who I am.
Simon goes through so many stages of coming out throughout the movie- 
From questioning his sexuality, falling in love with people and ideas, dreaming so far from reality, and landing back to the ground.

306,fbianco-99862,This movie brought back so many memories,10,18 May 2019,"The scene where blue deletes his email permanently reminded me of the most devastating moment in my life when something like that happened to me. I didn't think I could go on living after that. That happened to me decades ago and I never again experienced true love. That kind of live only comes once in a lifetime. There are so many people that have no idea what it's like to live like that, and I grew up in a time when it was impossible to come out, it would have been unacceptable. So I lived in denial my whole life. Today, as an old man I see so many happy young people together and it makes me so sad to realize what I missed in life. thank you for this movie because now those type of things are just memories for me.

307,villanuevachristianrae-61358,"Love, Simon (2018) - Teenage Drama King/Queen",7,25 June 2018,"Love, Simon is the movie that we are all been waiting for to be produced by a big production company because it tackles the struggles and bliss of coming out. Originally, it's a book named ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"", gladly they changed the title into a catchier one and more story related. The movie is a typical approach to a coming of age story it doesn't have the happy go lucky style of John Hughes or the personal stories and depth of Greta Gerwig's Lady Bird, but it still manages to tell a convincing story of a teenage boy coming to terms with everyone around him while hiding his real gender identity.Nick Robinsons is the star of this film he achieves to portray a discreet gay without being too flamboyant, even though his inner thoughts tell him to go all out. The diversity of the cast gives the film a glow and they can all act, honestly. Watching the film makes me feel nostalgic it portrays those moments that you don't know who you are yet and just laying on bed spending the days locked inside your bedroom being carefree, and the only problems are your high school secrets and crushes.The screenplay is very interesting and I believe it's the reason it's not rottenly rated by the critics. The inciting incident of the story starts when someone posts an anonymous coming out letter on a school organization's website where every student has an account. The name of the anonymous person is BLUE. Simon got inspired with BLUE's story so he starts to contact this person via email, and they started to share their own gay stories and fantasies. Simon gets closer and closer to the anonymous person online that he decides to catch him by getting hints on their emails and looking for him around the school and town. So, Simon's idea of BLUE gets too much in his head that almost every guy he meets becomes BLUE to him, but every time the intentions of the people is revealed he gets his heartbroken.Knowing Greg Berlanti's background he comes from television shows, and I can see his directing approach here is still for televised content it did not push the boundaries of queer films, but Love, Simon will always be remembered because of it's bravery to tell a story of a young gay man in this generation where some parents and adults are still closed minded. This film is still a triumph for the LGBT community.","Love, Simon"

It perfectly captures how hard it is to be a teenager and a closeted gay on top of that. Love, Simon understood me. Bottom line is that Love, Simon is now an essential gay movie, stereotypes are avoided and it takes time to get to a happy ending. Not only does this movie show how hard it is for a gay person to come out, it shows how hard it is for their family and friends to accept and understand them. It's just such a good movie and every gay person, out or not, should see it. The only problems with this film are that there were not lesbians and that the Straight Boys were not punched in the face. Also, I could care less for dudes and even I can admit that Bram was a whole snack (nothing compared to Abby tbh).

I mean, I don't have problem's with peoples that chose to be gay, or lesbians, it's just the thing, that i would not support to hear that from my kid... at last i just need to accept, but that can take some time.....
The movie was great, cause i saw something new, but I am still waiting for the moment that he realize. he like that girl and want to give her something that she deserve.Lovely, Nicu ♥ :))","Love, Simon"

322,sreuben-53921,A film full of heart and love.,10,8 February 2020,"Love, Simon is one of the greatest films I've seen. It's one of the only films my friend group and I went out to see and all thoroughly enjoyed. It's revolutionary, in its portrayal of Simon Spier, the titular character who is gay. This representation felt so good because the film is so good!
This film has a great script, a great cast, a fitting score and it sticks to the true nature of the book by Becky Albertalli. That everybody deserves a love story.
This film made me cry on the first watch, and made me cry again when I bought it on DVD to watch. This is truly an LGBT film masterpiece. Please watch it and give it the attention it deserves!!","Love, Simon"
323,mjohnson36203,"I laughed AND cried, but just a little",9,29 March 2018,"Love, Simon was a pleasant surprise. When my girlfriend asked me out to go see it I was skeptical to say the least. I figured I'd nap at some point during the movie. But that was not the case, I liked Simon almost immediately. All the actors were brilliant and believable and the drama teacher and vice principal were hilarious, though I will say the way they speak with the kids probably wouldn't fly in real life, a teacher should be able to speak with their student as frankly as they did but it's not the world we live.The movie as a whole was uplifting and happy. I wish I could really put into words how I felt after watching the movie...hopeful, I guess, I don't know, it was a positive feeling I can tell you that. I'll definitely watch it again when it comes to Netflix.","Love, Simon"
324,mehreng,Beautiful gay movie,4,2 September 2020,"Love, Simon is a young adult fiction movie. You will enjoy watching this movie. It has a beautiful group of friends around Simon.
Events happen so fast, but still some suspense who will be Simon's bf. Because every second boy Simon consider as Blue.There are many changes in the movie than in the novel. It's based on the main events only.It creates thrilling suspense for everyone by imagining different boys as Blue. While in the end, who is Blue and who comes out with Simon is shocking.Both are gay boys, but their love story through emails makes the movie, like the novel, more interesting. Finally, Simon makes his love story the best example for others. And teach many how to face such things.Those who love movies can watch it if they can't read 200 pages book.","Love, Simon"
325,amanda-552,Amazing Adaptation,10,18 March 2018,"Here are my thoughts about Love, Simon:First, it was definitely the best movie adaptation of a book I've ever seen. Hands down. It was also an extremely authentic story to begin with, and it translated so well as a movie.Second, I wish this movie had been around when I was younger. The message of love and acceptance was so powerful, and the way Simon and his friends were portrayed was amazing. Kudos to the actors. The whole theater was cheering, laughing, and crying with them.Representation matters. Our kids need to see themselves on screen in movies like this.","Love, Simon"
326,jameswd55,One of the best gay themed movies I have seen.,10,22 June 2018,This a great movie. Sad and uplifting at the same time. Nick Robinson is a good actor and played his character beautifully. I applaud the writers and director this film. Even though I thoroughly hated and wanted kill the homophobic Martin Simon gave him his just comeuppance without violence. I'm a hopeless gay romantic so this film made me laugh and cry throughout. Don't miss this film!!,"Love, Simon"
327,salamandermike,Disney-like Take On Being A Gay Teen,10,27 April 2018,"This is one of those fairy tales where you're gay and literally everyone around you is supportive except for two goofball bullies that are not really that threatening. My god, I wish I had come out in that setting. But, this movie isn't about the realities we face while coming out as a teenager; it's just about the inner struggle of coming to terms with not being hetero in a heteronormative world. It's extremely Disney in its portrayal. And I loved it! I was ready for a lighthearted take on this subject. I doubt I would have gone to see yet another gay tragedy in this world of gay tragedies.","Love, Simon"
328,dwebster83,Totally predictable and completely ridiculous.,1,12 June 2019,"Martin is a jerk, he should be in jail, not only does he ruin Simon's life, he also ruins the surprise 30 minutes into the film, ""what do you get when you mix black and Jewish? Blueish!"" Oh wow, way to ruin the whole film.This movie is boring and quite insulting actually.Coming from a gay guy who was also tormented as a teen by being outed online in the late 1990's, let me tell you, it wasn't this lovely. Even in the liberal Seattle area.","Love, Simon"
329,tbaker0040,Bring a Tissue,10,18 March 2018,"Such a great movie to see. Its a must see movie and I plan on seeing this one again. It kinda reminds me of Breakfast Club in a way I don't know how many people would agree with me on that but that's how it felt in many ways. I'm not going to lie but it brought out so many emotions in me and very few films can do that, so I would recommend maybe keeping a few tissues with you or extra napkins from concessions because you will need them. I hope that others enjoy this movie as much as I did. I noticed that a few gave this movie a 1 star and I hate to say this comparing it to Black Panther is stupid for one it doesn't even fall under the same genre so all your doing is promoting something else so clearly you didn't watch this movie at all. As for the other poorly given star review calling it trash you as well probably didn't see this movie either. So if your reading these reviews DO NOT pay any attention to them go and see this movie I PROMISE you won't regret it.","Love, Simon"
330,andrea_marie90,Exactly what I wish I'd had.,10,2 April 2018,"As someone who tends to never repeat seeing movies, I have been twice in theaters and I'm planning on seeing Love, Simon at least once more before it leaves my local theater. This movie is EXACTLY the kind of movie I wish I had seen 15 years ago. I wish, more than anything, that this was around so that I would feel more comfortable in my own skin. I am SO glad it exists today, because even as a 28 year old, I feel as though I left the theater a different person than before I went in. I can't have a enough positive feedback for this movie. From the storyline, the representation, the quality of acting. I look forward to this becoming a classic and paving the way for more rom-com's made for gays!","Love, Simon"
331,siriusgray,I completely and honestly love this movie,10,1 January 2019,"Love, Simon, directed by Greg Berlanti, is a movie that I think most casual viewers will find something to enjoy unless they are particularly averse to the cliches and tropes of high school coming of age stories and to an extent, romantic-comedies. For me, Love, Simon is a book-to-film adaptation that really hits all the right notes from its engaging plot, talented cast, amazing score and soundtrack and most importantly, its true-to-life message and themes.I wasn't very familiar with Nick Robinson before this film (I knew him as the older kid in Jurassic Word) but after watching Love, Simon, I couldn't imagine any other actor in this role. Nick Robinson succeeds in bringing to life a charming, funny and realistic Simon that is inherently sympathetic while never demanding sympathy from the other characters in the movie in the sense that the viewer is never asked to have pity for Simon because he is gay. In fact, it is directly stated in the movie that Simon is comfortable with the fact that he is gay since that is simply a part of who he is. Instead, the viewer is intended to sympathize with Simon's internal conflict to balance his desire to maintain the status quo which for Simon means his otherwise perfect life with his desire to completely be himself which in large part means being able to pursue love in the same way as anybody else. What I love most about this film is how it shows Simon's struggle with coming out as being largely driven by his fear of the inevitable changes that will come from crossing ""that"" line, a struggle that is made more difficult by how lonely it can be for someone in Simon's position until they take that first step over the line. This is probably why I found the scene where Simon comes out to Abby for the first time to be so moving and effecting (and undoubtedly why it is one of the two scenes in the movie that consistently makes me tear up). As stated in that second scene (you know the one), this is the first moment in his life that Simon starts to exhale and from that moment onward, the viewer can start to exhale with him.Love, Simon is a movie that truly made me feel the emotions that Simon was feeling throughout the story. Through all of Simon's highs and lows (and there are many towards the end), I felt like I was experiencing them with Simon and that is not something I can say about most movies. The movie is a consistently good high school comedy throughout its run but the sequences starting with Martin's posting of Simon's conversations with Blue on the high school message board (effectively outing Simon) to Simon's reconciliations with his parents and best friend, Leah, and finally to the resolution on the Ferris Wheel (with the revealing of Blue's identity) is something truly special. I appreciate that the movie takes the time to show the consequences of Simon's coming out and doesn't immediately rush to the foregone happy conclusion.Love, Simon is a movie that may or may not stick with you but even if it doesn't, I don't see any reason to not watch this movie at least once. Even if you don't leave this movie in love with Love, Simon (although there are many people who have and will continue to do so), what matters is that you leave this movie being able to love yourself and the people close to you who are in Simon's situation. Like a classic John Hughes' movie, whoever said an important message can't be a little cheesy?","Love, Simon"

It's so important, relevant and well made.The characters are loveable, realistic and feel familiar from real life. Good acting, great script and the endingscene is beautiful and with so
much emotion!I really hope a movie like this could change the world for the better. It's horrible to be young and in deep love with someone - but society won't accept your choice of love. Everyone in this world should be allowed to give their love to whomever they want to. Everyone deserves their own love story....","Love, Simon"

I saw a lot of people crying and even I left the room with the lump in my throat. I don't know if the director followed the book to the letter, but to me the scenes were very eye pleasing; plus a really good storyline.
Last but not least, don't even get me started on the characters, thay were all great and I only ask for more movies like this.","Love, Simon"

I dreaded throughout the movie, thinking this is just an average teen movie with an LGBT main character. I still stand by my thoughts. However this movie was more pleasant than I anticipated. A nice flow, nice soundtrack and overall a light hearted movie. It's still average tbh (with the mediocre jokes), but I left the theater quite pleased. The ending where they finally revealed who Blue was all along, even though I anticipated the plot, it is still very cute. The whole audience cheered and clapped and it truly was beautiful that moment was! I've never seen that before! So in short, a cute movie, I'd recommend it for those who want to watch something nice and cute for a change with all those intense movies on at the moment (Infinty war :( ) (my first ever review!

341,jacobhole,One of my favourite films ever!,8,11 April 2018,"This film is just beautiful.As someone me who is gay and has dealt with being closeted/gay in a school environment, I can exaggerate how much I relate to Simons situation in this film. I don't tend to get emotional when it comes to films but this film is an exception. Moments in this film left me in tears,gleefully grinning like a mad man and made me feel sick to my stomach as, like aforementioned, I relate so much to the characters.Apart from that, it stands as a lighthearted joyful coming of age story even for those who don't relate to the storylines/characters. The other characters were also great, with the group of friends having amazing chemistry, the parents portraying how parents in this situation would act and the email suspects acting as diverse alterations of what the audience may persive as the 'stereotypical gay teenagers'.I was surprised with the amount of humour throughout the film and also suprised at how actually funny it was.Overall, the film was a joyful coming of age story which I went into thinking it would be hollywood's attempt to relate to LGBT+ teens and came out with a new favourite film of all time.","Love, Simon"
342,drudesandstorm,"Mediocre, Simon",5,1 April 2018,"This film arises some controversy, as anything would that deals with controversial subjects. While movies like Beautiful Thing and The Boys in the Band could pull off a controversial subject with grace, unlike movies like Ben and Arthur and this to an extent don't really pull the point across without seeming pandering.
-
There are aspects to this movie that are good, the humor is decent, the main character is a good actor, and it's message is good for teens. The problem is, pandering. It wants to jerk off gays by showing a reality that's skewed. Homophobia isn't as common as the film wants to show, it's mostly people don't care. But it did seem to advert from the idea of more than 2 genders, which I'm glad about. If you want to watch a movie about LGBT, then go watch the aforementioned movies that pulled off the concept well. But if you're looking for a laugh at humor, to see some nice camera work, or laugh at pandering, this is for you.","Love, Simon"

It's soft and sweet like a cotton candy. I love almost all characters, especially Simon's parents 'cause although it was a little bit hard to accept the truth that Simon was gay, they still faced it, and after all, what they felt was guilty when they didn't know sooner and let Simon stucked alone. They might be the best parents that a kid could ever ask.","Love, Simon"

What I find most unbelievable is that this movie came out of America, there's hope for it yet.Love, the rest of the world.","Love, Simon"
345,jeffreytkd,Relatable?,5,14 March 2018,"Hollywoods attempt to make ""homosexuality"" relatable and accepting by casting the straightest guy in Hollywood to play a 17 year old gay kid is a little (very) troubling. No offense to Nick Robinson who plays this part beautifully and is an amazing talented actor, but he was doomed from the start when he was offered this role. It seems that every time Hollywood tries to make a stab at accepting gay culture and lifestyle, it decides to cast the straightest people possible(ex: Brokeback Mountain and every other gay movie). Which is to say, I'm not saying straight people can't play gay roles or gay actors cannot play straight roles, because through out movie history this has been done. But when your premis of a movie is centered around ""coming out of the closet"" and finding ""who you truly are"", wouldn't it be fitting to cast an actual gay actor who really knows and understands the struggle? Sure we live in a more accepting time and I'm happy to see someone like Nick Robinson play this part because more and more straight men and women are becoming accepting, but if I want anyone to speak for me or play a character that relates to me, I'd choose a gay actor and not a straight one. You're telling me there's not ONE gay actor that could've pulled this off in Hollywood of all places? Not ONE gay actor? Think about that.","Love, Simon"

The pace was well spent, the acting was spot on, the overall feeling was there. It was funny when it needed to be and serious where you less expected it to be. I liked how this picture is selfish in not letting you be distracted by how well made it's made. Regardless of how you see it, this movie is good. It will make your soul giggle and your face smile. It did me. If a movie is approached to be enjoyed and loved then this one is a well put example. Solid movie indeed.","Love, Simon"

I put off watching the movie for a long time - not because I thought it wouldn't live up to the book, but because I had to get myself ""ready"" to watch it. The book and the movie resonates so strongly with me because, well, so many parts of my own coming out are reflected in Simon's story. Watching the movie brought back so many memories and brought forth many tears of both joy and sadness. The team behind the movie have done a great job capturing the essence of the book, which does a great job at capturing the highs, lows, and all the in-betweens of being a gay teenager trying to find himself. A special thanks to Nick Robinson for bringing Simon to life for us - you did a great job.Heartwarming, revealing, and powerful, this movie will stay with me forever. I hope whoever needs to see this movie does see it, and can see that through all the internal anxiety and pressure of being a gay teenager, things will work out if you allow yourself to be who you are inside.","Love, Simon"

My friend has been hyping it for a really long time and she made me read the book. I loved that and I was really looking forward to see the movie.It did not disappoint. At all.I think this movie is relatable to a lot of people in all kind of different ways and the story is so beautiful and important. 
It's so funny and moving and the characters are all really nice in their own way. In the end (at the climax, sort of) the whole audience was cheering, sobbing and applauding. Go and check this out, you'll walk out of the theatre with a smile on your face, I'll promise you that.","Love, Simon"
352,runningchik,Good message for first big-screen gay rom com,9,16 April 2018,"I see a lot of complaints about the fact that the main character is a rich white male with pretty liberal family and friends. I understand that frustration and yes, there are a lot of people who do not share similar experiences and those are stories that will also hopefully be told one day. But at the same time, there are a lot of people who do share similar experiences and situations as Simon's. For this story, I thought it was beautifully done and was finally a film that did not over sexualize the gay community. As a lesbian who tries to find representation in film and TV, I too often find myself frustrated with the LGBT community being portrayed as sex-obsessed, infidelity-ridden, and predatorial humans. This was a story that actually represents so many in the gay community. Just a teenage boy who is struggle to figure himself out, like the rest of teenagers, but also battling with his sexuality and acceptance. It's a wholesome film that anyone can watch and you walk out of the theater feeling good. Of course, there are a lot of LGBT people who do not have as positive coming out experiences as Simon does, myself included, but maybe starting out with a depressing and dramatic LGBT coming out story for mass audiences would be a bad idea and triggering for a lot of people. This movie leaves its viewers with hope and a good message. I am glad this was done, but its long overdue.","Love, Simon"
353,mattioskarisaarinen,Good beginning,7,5 June 2018,"As a gay teen that really unidentifies to be part of LGBT-community, I was really interested to see this movie that finally had a ""generic dude living his life"" in it. And indeed it had the guy, Simon as a character is a really nice presentation for a questioning teen how a gay person can be like - not just the stereotypical and often flamboyant type what media typically presents. There was things that made my wheels go backwards. The timeline was weird, the other characters where quickly written and overall it was somewhat too soft and even cheesy. Also I'm not a big fan of PC-language.At some points I just felt that it was made for white young girls that glorify homosexuality, but in the other hand I really did like it how the movie showed homosexual persons struggles from straight perspective and how they can be affected by it too.I think this movie is a good start for this type of movie genre where being LGBT is normalized and not glorified. Subjects like internalized homophobia and fake girlfriends are missing, even though there were good spots for them, but that's for an another movie.","Love, Simon"

I could relate to Simon's journey so much., From being blackmailed to the internal torment. All the actors were spot on. Nick Robinson was simply spectacular.

I wish there had been a movie like this when I was growing up.vit would have saved me a lot of heartache.","Love, Simon"

One thing that I didn't like is is the ending, too much cliche and cheesy imho. I don't really like how it turned out of them in public flashy like that as usual teenage drama. I just hope that they settle it more personal. For Blue coming out step by step, first to Simon, then to his friends and family, later go public after a while.
Overall is really great minus the ending, the wheel scene.","Love, Simon"

How long were they mailing each other, and not one junk email popped up. Obviously a dud email address. As soon as you launch an email account it's sold to the highest spam bidder.Now we've got the nitty gritty out of the way. I really enjoyed the film, its no masterpiece or Hollywood film of the year. But it was a really nice easy film to watch, with a good story, good cast and well acted. Even if Simon's dancing was a bit cringe.It had a bit of humour and some good music in there too. Also liked the score, especially the 80s electro sound for the title track.Nice to see a gay film that isn't made on a tiny budget or full of cliche's and unrealistic love matches. And it also had an actual story, not just steamy windows and topless jocks.**SPOILER**
The only cringe moment was the ferris wheel scene at the end, how someone as shy and closeted as Blue can just pop out in front of half of the school watching and waiting. And then kiss him straight away too. It would more likely have been afterwards and away from the crowd.A nice love story. And a good easy watch.","Love, Simon"

If the movie could make us sympathized with her, it could be better. It's tell but don't show us how bad is her life. Katherine Lanford acting is ok but her eyes can't show how she love Simon.She is the most inportant things that make why Simon's life fall apart when he come out. When the movie can't show us how much she love Simon and how bad is her ""different"" life, what is doing just make me feel she is mean . Martin: what is he doing is not make me feel this is a real person.","Love, Simon"
362,inforlonghaul,Refreshing and Energetic,10,18 June 2018,"Wonderful movie. I have seen it 3 times and it's just as good as it was the first time I saw it. It's a teenage coming of age movie that is suitable for people of all ages. While it's cliche at times with some stereotypes, it's funny, dramatic and romantic enough that I think most people will end feeling satisfied that they've seen a movie worth their time.Love, Simon is typical in some respects that have been exhausted in tons of other movies, but in so many ways it is refreshing and energetic. You genuinely feel a connection to Simon. You want to love and hold him while he's struggling and laugh with him when he's happy.Many questioned whether or not films like these are even still necessary, but sadly they still are. But that's not a bad thing either. Sometimes you just need a good movie to watch to escape the realities of life at times.Nick Robinson (Jurassic World) was phenomenal in this role and has a bright future in acting. Katherine Langford (13 Reasons Why) and the others were the icing on the cake to make this film a worthy addition to the LGBT movie collection. I don't give too many films a 10/10, but this movie goes to the top of my list. A sequel for these characters is definitely on my petition list.If you haven't seen it, I can't encourage you enough to at least watch it one time.","Love, Simon"

364,jefferson_rodrigues,Loved it!,8,30 May 2021,"The story is about Simon, he has a completely normal life, he has a good relationship with his family and a lot of good friends too, but he has a big secret, he's actually gay, and then we start to see how he handles having to hide this thing about yourself from society.Unlike other films that deal with homosexuality, this is not a film where the guy will just suffer; Love, Simon is a lighter film, of course Simon has problems, but they decide to show that his life is not just suffering, he can be happy like anyone else too, and a lot about this film is very palpable, it is realistic , we can understand and sometimes even put ourselves in his shoes.At the beginning of the movie we found out that there is another hidden gay guy at Simon's school, he posted anonymously on a blog that almost everyone seems to follow, and so Simon decided to write to him anonymously too, and then they started talking about their life with each other. This plot continues until the end as we try to figure out who is the guy that Simon is talking to.The Simon actor is very good, I couldn't imagine another guy in his role, the dialogues are very good too, there are no extremely forced dialogues like in other teen films or TV shows, but there is something that bothered me, there was a drama made by Simon's friends when something happened, the way they handled it was very strange and exaggerated.Ultimately Love, Simon is amazing, I'm sad that I haven't seen this movie before, I ended up with a big smile on my face, I highly recommend this movie to everyone, it deals with a very important topic, and it can even help some people to have more empathy. Now I have a plan to watch Love, Victor and I am expecting nothing less than Love, Simon.","Love, Simon"

Made me feel more comfortable with myself in a way that nothing back then had.But as I grew up, and rewatched it, I realized something.This movie made progress, but that's it. It showed queer people still as the other and promotes stereotypes. But worst of all, it only shows the main relationship for the last few minutes of the movie.If this classic, stereotypical teenage movie was a straight one, this wouldn't have happened.The book (Which I only read a few years ago) represents us way better then this movie.","Love, Simon"

I was excited to see it from the very first trailer, and I cannot put into words how so far above and beyond my expectations that it went. The movie is absolutely brilliant. I couldn't stop laughing, unless I was crying. Please, please see it.We live in a day and age now where almost everyone can say they know someone who's gay. If you want to understand us, to understand our struggles and our pain, and what we go through, I implore you, please watch this movie. It will take you through all the ups and the downs, and it will give you an insight into the life experience of someone who grows up gay. It humanizes us, it makes us real, and it does so in a way that is light and funny, emotional when it needs to be, and isn't overbearing or pushy. It takes the issues we all struggle with as teenagers...and it shows you how those change when you add being gay on top of it.From the fear of being discovered, being willing to tell any lie, hurt anyone just to keep your secret, to the hope of that first attempt at flirting (which goes badly for LITERALLY everyone), and wondering if he's just being nice or if he's really into you. Finding out that first crush is into girls instead. The pain of the dead silence you get in response to the first time you say the words ""I'm gay"" to someone you love....and even the struggle to let that G word out of your mouth for the first time in someone else's company.I wish this had existed when I was that age. Maybe I wouldn't have been so terrified for so long of who I really was. Maybe I would have been able to find the humor, and the courage, to know that I would be okay long ago. But I am so incredibly proud to live in a society, 20 years later, where this film will get a wide theatrical release, and I hope it will be a hit. I hope it will inspire today's kids growing up gay to know that they are okay, they're normal, and they're going to be alright.","Love, Simon"

I could have cried while watching this, if I didn't have on so much makeup and wasn't going out after I saw it. when my friends had said they saw this movie 6+ times, I was thinking to myself ""okay, that's a little much."" but now I see why.","Love, Simon"

I graduated in 2016 as an out and proud bisexual, but there were definitely hardships. I remember having fantasies as depicted in the film about life after high school, away from the people seemingly hellbent on ruining what remained of my childhood. I knew I had a supportive family and friends around me, who would accept me, but I didn't want everything to change. Life wasn't good before coming out, but I was afraid that doing so would make it worse. Love, Simon is an excellent film that portrays issues surrounding coming out, and I would recommend this movie to anyone, LGBT+ or otherwise.

384,kenan3248,"Huge insult to the whole LGBTQI+ community, specially Gay people",3,8 June 2019,"There were good things about of course whiche were good cinematography, location, music, sound and other things. And I am accepting that there were great job done behind. Congratulations on that. But I can't say same thing about story and a way they tried to tell us. First of all, as a person who experienced I know how it feels to be closeted and try to find a person to talk with who you can trust. All these stuff and him saying his bff about his orientation and afterwards her reactions were considerably realistic but clichè. I also understand him trying to find a boy who came out recently through the internet. It is okay to find him to talk and share feelings but fall in love ? Seriously? Knowing about him literally nothing, haven't seen him yet but you can still fall in love ? Okay we may understand that but how awkward is it to have feelings towards every person (I count 4 people) he thought who could be Blue ? As a gay person I accept this part of storytelling as an insult to whole community, including me and I felt pretty offended and not even touched a little by movie. It was kind of telling people that gay people only looking for another one to be together and only thing they care is that. I am sorry but it was kind of homophobic pinkwashing saying that we shot gay movie we are not discriminating, but real thing is that it was an soft insult to all of us. Next time get in contact or maybe include some gay people behind the project so it would be better than that I am sure. Nothing left to say but SHAME","Love, Simon"

390,saphire-11289,I can't begin to explain what movie means so much to me.,10,20 December 2019,"Not only is ""Love, Simon"" a well written, directed, and acted movie but it is immensely important. I see a lot of LGBTQ people bash this movie because maybe it's not perfect or they just want to be offended about something. For a major blockbuster movie to be centered around a gay guys coming out story is huge. Maybe to people who are out this is not very important, but you being out and proud is different than someone who is not out. I am not out but am planning on coming out soon and this movie really means so much to me. I would consider it my favorite movie tbh (considering I cried in most parts). I am 20 but I can only imagine how 13 year old me would have reacted to this movie, I might have came out sooner (although I'm not even late coming out now tbh). My point is that I just know that this movie has touched and really meant a lot to other LGBTQ people who maybe are not in a great place in life or have unaccepting family so they feel like they can't come out.Thank you to anyone who was a part of this film.","Love, Simon"

I've been watching cheesy coming of age films since I was 13 but I never connected to any of them. Watching a boy fall in love with a girl over and over again left me weary and sad, longing for something I could relate to. And then came Love, Simon.I cried when Simon kissed a boy on screen, I've never seen a film in the cinema where something like that happened so casually, so positively. The acceptance and love Simon received after coming out will either resonate with LGBT+ people because it mirrors their treatment when they came out, because it shows them how they want their future coming out to go, or because they're finally seeing the acceptance they deserved and never got onscreen.In short, this is a gay film without barbs. It touches on homophobia, but in a way that isn't hugely upsetting. It has positive messages like I've never seen before, and made me cry more times than I can count. Myself and the three other LGBT+ people I saw the film with all came out feeling like a weight had been lifted from us: we were allowed to exhale.","Love, Simon"

8 of 10!","Love, Simon"
395,blink182_lovah,"So cliche, yet so perfect",10,19 March 2019,"I really regret not seeing this in theaters. After seeing other reviews about audiences going wild during the last scene of the movie, I really wish I could have been part of that! I would have been cheering and clapping the loudest probably.
This movie really hits home for me. Granted, unlike Simon, I did not come out until a few years after high school but so many parts of the film resonated with me. I have literally had that conversation in the car late at night with my dear friends, telling them ""I'm gay"". I remember struggling to let those two words out when I told my parents, even though I knew they would be fine with it.
I was fortunate enough not to be outed by someone but my heart stops everytime I watch Simon yell at Martin about taking that moment away from him. I just can't even. I have never felt so much feeling towards a movie character before, and that really speaks to Nick Robinson as an actor.
This movie has all the cliches of a romantic comedy/drama but now we get to see it in the view of a closeted teenager. And for someone like me, that is what makes it special. It has a brilliant cast, including the legendary Jennifer Garner as Simon's mother (how did she NOT receive an Oscar, that Exhale scene was EVERYTHING). I honestly would give Nick an Oscar too, he was just brilliant, if I could meet him in person I would shake his hand.
Another thing I really enjoyed about this movie is that it's not oversexualized like most LGBT romance stories. Sure it has some innuendos and references to sex but the attraction between Simon and Blue is between email, and quite frankly if Blue turned out to be one of those Game of Thrones geeks he saw in the school halls I am sure the ending of the movie would have been the same. That is powerful.
I hope this movie inspires people, and not just LGBT but everyone. Like Simon said, revealing who you are to the world can be terrifying. Just know that there is always support for you even if it feels like there is not. Please see this film if you haven't already, and if you aren't at least wet-eyed or cheering during the final 10 minutes of the film, then I will eat my hat.
Also, special shout out to Ms. Albright, she wins for funniest person in the movie!","Love, Simon"

398,calumgrieve,Easy watch however nothing too special.,6,19 March 2018,"Love Simon is a Drama Romace with a bit of comedy, directed by Greg Berlanti and is based from the bestselling book ""Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda"" by Becky Albertalli. It stars Nick Robinson as Simon, Katherine Langford as Leah, Alexandra Shipp as Abby, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Nick and Logan Miller as Martin. It Premiers on the 16th March (USA) and releases on the 6th April in the uk.Love Simon is about teen Simon coming out as gay and his struggles in doing so. We find out very early in the film that Simon is gay however he has told no-one, we see his frustration as a 'straight male' throughout the start of the film with his dads inappropriate jokes and his previous straight relationships. We see Simon living a 'nornal' teenagers life with his three best friends Leah, Abby and Nick. Near the start of the film we see the school social media group chat appear with a message from a boy who goes by 'Blue' telling us that he is gay but feel he cannot tell anyone. Simon is in a very similar position decides to anonymously email blue under the name jaque and they bond over their similarities as gay men who have never told anyone. however after a number of emails back and forth a less popular school kid Martin finds the emails and screenshots them. Hr continues to use these screenshots to blackmail Simon to help him get together with Abby. This makes simon make some really importand desicisions through out the film.The positivesLove Simon is filmed with the best of intentions of helping others in real life who may be gay to come out as who they really are. It eventually shows the positives of coming out hoever shows the difficulties along the way. it also covers how unfair many are towards gay people and our poor social sytem of acceptance. The acting from Nick Robinson was outstanding and very believable while the rest of the cast performed well Natasha Rothwell stole the comedy aspect of the film being the only actress to really make me laugh with her fantastic delivery. The film is set in a stereotypical american school which i quite like as its somthin we can all relate to some way or another and gives for a easy to watch film. The film covers the relationships between Simon and his friends, this creqtes intence seens and conflict whoch is yet another hook on why to watch.The negitivesFirstly for all the good jokes fron natasha bothwell there were plenty of typical simple american jokes such as the princeipal who kept making bad jokes which were unrealistic to be said in frofront pf students. Also the teo cahracters which were supposed to be the ""bullies"" werejust cringeworthey and had no real motive or even connection to Simon himself. The film also had the characters saying ""what the f"" instead of sweading which no one over the age of 12 says (the main character being in his late teens) even after that he starts tp swear later in the movie. So the reason for npt swaering at the start is beyond me and gave fpr a fake anrealistic feelling thrpught. Finally Nick was really inconsistent through out at first the funny happy guy half way throught the stupid gullible guy and at the end the over reacting seripus guy, i ouldent quite place him 2hich made him less relatable as a character.Overall this film wasent bad at all and sent a really good message across the screen. However the undeveloped characters such as the bullies and Nick and the cringe amd bad american jokes has to be taken into condieration. I give ""love, simon"" a 6/10.","Love, Simon"

I've read it and I think it is great, true love. Unfortunately, movie is different. I know it can't be the same but it could be more similar. Some things aren't even said. They're not so important but it would be better to say them to understand the whole story. 
It is too emotional, yeah, it's good and cute but not real and I had a feeling that it's just too quick.

401,DavidO-Scotland,"Loved the book, enjoyed the film",8,9 April 2018,"As often happens when a film is based or adapted from a book the film often lacks the depth and intimacy of the book. I did enjoy the film even though the story line and indeed a major character relationship was changed for the film. A lot of the developing relationship and indeed humour between Simon and Blue via emails as depicted in the book was lost in the film which was a shame. 
However as a stand alone film it works well and deals sensitively and, where appropriately, humorously with what is for some a sensitive subject. The cast were strong and the film moved along briskly. I was disappointed with the near final scene where Simon and Blue actually met as it was all a bit Disney and for me the on looking and cheering crowed spoilt what should have been an intensely private and moving moment.
Still, an enjoyable film and well worth a watch.","Love, Simon"

The source book is better, though, and some of the things from the book I would like to have seen more faithfully translated, especially directly around Si's outing.I think because I identify so strongly with this movie that I wanted it to be everything. It has pretty good writing, and pretty good acting, and a fun soundtrack. While it's a pretty good movie, I'm not sure that it will end up being a truly iconic film that is discussed in twenty years, except maybe for its first in its class nature.

All the actors and actresses in the movie had a clear idea of what to do and their acting wasn't fake or forced. Some of the characters, like Leah, Ethan, and especially Bram should've had more depth and complexity to add to the audience's sympathy for them. I feel like the relationship between Simon and Bram could be more developed. The movie should have a better focus on how they gradually bonded through the emails. Other than those points, the movie was groundbreaking and was much needed; it was funny how at the end of the movie Simon inspired his classmates to confess and reach out for help, and also in real life people who watched the movie really did get inspired to come out.","Love, Simon"

Dealing with the struggle of coming out in a world mostly accepting but also shows that even in this time and age there is a struggle. Its beautiful script really allows you to feel and relate to Simons (Nick Robinsons) character, with amazing acting from the whole cast.
Though every moment you can feel the joy, frustration and the sadness in each and every scene. To really focus on each emotive state the music choices are excellent and every time i listen to any song in this heart felt story my mind goes back to each scene in the film.
This really is a modern day relatable masterpiece. 10/10","Love, Simon"

410,hbehjoo,Not even close to the best love stories I have seen!,2,11 August 2018,"Admit it. It is an aweful movie. So lousy, Too boring to watch, Excessive background music, too predictable with that happy ending. Sure, if you're already having a great day and you wanna watch a cheesy love story this can be your choice. Still, not the best choice. I am not prejudiced, nor am I a homophobe. I'm just saying that I have seen great love stories i.e The Handmaiden 2016, Maurice 1987, Brokeback mountain 2005, but this wasn't one of them. At last, pardon me for this review for i'm not a native speaker and couldn't write better","Love, Simon"
411,d-57685,"Worth watching, but not astounding",8,8 October 2018,"I don't like romance films, however I'll be the first to admit that I actually really enjoyed this one. The gay main character was refreshing, and despite the fact that I am straight, I could easily empathise and become emotionally invested in Simon's journey. Quite funny too, and I did shed a few tears at the end. However, I was slightly disappointed with some of the clichés (the reason I don't normally watch romcoms) in the film. The quirky group of friends, the deep moment where everyone opens up, the teacher who tries to be 'in' with the kids did disappointed me a little, but not enough to ruin the film. And some people enjoy the predictability and clichés, so I guess that's just personal preference.","Love, Simon"
412,liliancren,Awesome Simon,10,21 September 2019,"This is my first review, as well as my first 10 out of ten. So I don't how I didn't notice this movie before. Indeed this movie is perfect for several reasons. This was the perfect way to threat a subject like homosexuality. The construction is so good even if it's a bit slow at beginning. But the second part is awesome, I mean the scene of the coming out, the way the parents are reacting, which is the perfect way! Adding a bit of drama with his friends was a really good idea and well realized 👍. Then, we he found ""blue"" is so adorable, as well as the final scene with everyone happy in the car!
So yeah, awesome movie for me!!","Love, Simon"

414,povalicia,This movie warmed my heart,8,22 March 2019,"I think we need this kind of movies.
First of all the soundtrack is great and the actors too. And second of all the most important is what this movie telling us. Its not just a story about a guy who in love with another guy its the story about fear, appreciation and bravery of being who you are.
I was thinking about one scene for weeks. The scene where Simon tells Martin that he took away from him the chance of coming out by himself. From all the movie this scene was the best and most significant.","Love, Simon"
415,wordsmith_works,A Realistic and Sensitive Story,10,18 March 2018,"My 10-year old daughter asked if we could see Love, Simon. Honestly, I expected a story about a cool gay guy supported by his friends and overcoming stereotypical opposition by Dad and the jocks at school. Sure, there was the (girl) best friend who is secretly in love with him and the macho father who can't cope. But overall, this is an outstanding depiction of the pain and anguish of declaring your sexuality -- in high school no less -- even in these supposed progressive times.Despite the hackneyed ending, I really enjoyed Love, Simon. You will, too.","Love, Simon"
416,mustang-82542,Very Heartwarming Film,10,12 April 2019,"In High School and hiding a big secret, 'Love, Simon' follows the life of Simon Spier (Nick Robinson), who, like a fair amount of people, are gay and in the closet. Simon keeps his secret because he doesn't want others to think of him differently since he loves people of the same gender. This coming of age film shows the difficult process that many LGBT members have to go through when they come out or attempt to come out.
'Love, Simon' hits a lot of key points when it comes to the lives of people in the closet and really shows the struggles they go through when they want to come out. The film reeled the audience in throughout the whole film because of a secret pen pal who is in the closet just like Simon. Simon loves talking to someone whom he can relate to but we can tell he is eager to meet said pen pal because of the developing connection throughout the film.
As Simon's relationship with his secret pen pal begins to blossom, it is soon threatened when someone figures out about his pen pal and his secret. Desperate to keep hold of his secret, Simon agrees to meet the blackmailers demands, even at the expense of his closest friends. Tensions rise as Simons attempts to help the person blackmailing him fail. This is a perfect example for one of the struggles that LGBT members face in life where they aren't sure if they want to come out but might be forced to because other people out them.
While this film hits home for a few in the LGBT community, it does not give an accurate depiction of the mass majority. This is where we get into spoilers so if you have not seen the movie, then skip to the last paragraph...... Since Simon has failed to get Abby with Martin, Martin leaked everything that he had on Simon. From that point on Simon lost his friends, his secret pen pal deleted his secret account, and he was mocked at school for now being the second kid that is out of the closet. Eventually, he gets his friends back and he meets his secret pen pal, Bram and life becomes this perfect accepting world they live in. This is where the film fails to shed light.
This film is fantastic at keeping the audience on the edge of their seat wanting to know what happens next, but it fails to show the other half of the story. For many, coming out not only makes them lose their friends, but also their family. There is a good majority of LGBT members who have come out and their parents simply do not approve and try to ""help"" their child. This film only shows what happens in a perfect world where everyone accepts, in this case, Simon, for whom he is and that is where the LGBT community lost connection with the film because not all are accepted by everyone they encounter.","Love, Simon"
417,damaxhine,Loved it!,10,27 May 2019,Absolutely a fun watch!! I had tears in my eyes most times.,"Love, Simon"
418,lerryhazel,I'm so irritated i had to create an account and write a review,1,5 July 2019,"You know, I generally believe that teen movies do more harm that good, and I'm utterly grateful to my parents for never letting me watch them when I was still a teenager. But, in their awkward and unbelievable way, most teen movies at least try to get the ""right"" message across. ""Love, Simon"" is different, - and not in a good way.
First of all, the movie doesn't even try to pretend it is not ridiculous. I mean, the plot only happens because one character - who, as we later learn, is determined to keep his identity a secret even from a potential love interest, - decides to announce his sexuality on a SCHOOL GOSSIP SITE; and another character decides to access his correspondence with a person clearly big on privacy FROM A PUBLIC COMPUTER, in spite of having a phone capable of checking e-mails, if he absolutely can't wait. Meanwhile, nothing was stopping them from meeting, say, in an online support group and then accidentally letting it slip they go to the same school, but, I guess, the writers were too lazy to add the extra twist. Anyway, when the secret inevitably gets discovered, that second character - Simon - decides to lie to his friends instead of just talking to them: and, yes, I get that he is not ready, blah-blah-blah, but, if he had told his friends he was being blackmailed, would they have insisted on knowing why before agreeing to help? Not to mention that he does end up telling Abby he is gay; but when she doesn't immediately produce a crucifix and start reciting an exorcism, he still doesn't bother telling her ""and that's why Martin is blackmailing me, so could you, please, gently but firmly let him know he has no chance?"".However, that is not really a problem: nowadays a lot of movies are written like they want to end up on ""CinemaSins"". That's the moral aspect that concerns me.
Because at first glance, the whole ""I know my parents and friends would stand by me but I just don't feel like having the awkward conversation"" whining basically feels like a giant spit to the face of every person who's ever been afraid to come out because they might be thrown out of the house, or beaten half to death, or lose their job, or go to prison...
Of course, if one's problems are not apocalyptic, it doesn't mean they are not worth considering, and I wouldn't have minded if they had made a film about how coming out is a big deal and it's OK to be afraid even if there is no physical threat.
Except, if we go back to the very beginning, we are, presumably, supposed to celebrate the anonymous ad on the school site as an acceptable and promising first step: except the Anonymous turns out to be Bram - a popular sportsman no one would probably suspect, but every bully at school would definitely double their abuse of every kid that ""looks gay"".
And then the authors seem to have no problem with making fun of Ethan's coming-out.
And the supposed happy ending shows us how Simon, having gone through traumatic experience of forced coming-out, forces the man he supposedly loves into a very public and very between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place coming-out.Speaking of love, it's almost noteworthy how, despite the token protest about Simon and Ethan not being a couple and the quest to find ""the one"" being the whole point of the story, the film manages to fall into the ""your soulmate is the other gay person in the vicinity"" trope. And by that I mean not only the fact that the character literally ends up with the very first guy he considered, but the way Simon's relationship with Blue is presented throughout the film.
It's clear from how poor his search is going that Simon doesn't know anything about Blue, which is not surprising, since they don't seem to discuss anything but their respective experiences as closeted gay teenager in their letters: I'm too lazy to go and check, but did the initial ad even specify Blue was male? Consequently, our character's only criteria for ticking candidates off his list is them showing interest in girls: and, not getting to learn anything else about the guys, the audience is actually unable to root for any pairing. Moreover, despite all his talk about ""true love"", Simon's willingness to ""cast"" every attractive guy as Blue proves that he doesn't care either.In other words, it kinda bothers me how many people seem to like this, ahem, film.","Love, Simon"
419,danthebang,LIFE-CHANGING MOVIE,10,20 August 2019,"I knew about this movie for a long time but always postponed to watch it. And then i did. I SOBBED throughout the whole movie because i related to it so much. It was like i was watching my self from the side, so many relatable situations with friends and family. Except one thing - I still didn't come out to my parents. Watching the movie i felt every Simon's coming out, like i was doing it myself. I even had to pause it a few times to catch my breath, cause it felt so real. After watching this movie i was so happy, sad and jealous for him at the same time. I couldn't sleep all night, my mind was racing, i started to feel like I'm ready to come out to my parents. And then, in the morning i did. It was the hardest thing i did in my life. BUT I DID IT. AND I'M SO HAPPY. And if not this movie i might be in the closet for my whole life, cause i NEVER planned to do it.I couldn't be more thankful to everyone who participated in this movie. Everyone should see it, even if they are not gay, just to see what a gay person has to go trough (and this is not even the worst situation showed).Once again - THANK YOU for changing my life","Love, Simon"

421,johnwage,A Phenomenal Movie That MUST Be Watched!!!,9,19 March 2018,"Love, Simon is a story about a young man named Simon who has a secret that no one else knows about, and Simon needs to decide if and how he should reveal his secret now that he has discovered someone else in his school has the same exact secret: they're both gay.This film is about so much more than coming to terms with one's sexual orientation. In fact, what makes this movie so special is the universal theme of how to be who you truly are and live with integrity, even when you might be subject to adversity because of it. It's a film about finding the courage within yourself to be who you truly are no matter what. This is precisely what makes the film relatable to anyone who watches it.The theme may sound serious and heavy, but director Greg Berlanti skillfully balances humorous entertainment with real, vulnerable and sensitive emotion. I heard this from many who watched the movie: never before has a movie made them laugh and cry so much in the span of a couple hours. Love, Simon is a force to be reckoned with!All the acting was great and nuanced, and you will definitely walk away relating to many of the characters because of it. The music was fantastic. Don't be surprised if many of the songs are stuck in your head afterwards. And the script and dialogue will stay with you for long after you watched the film. There are some REALLY powerful moments!I highly suggest you watch Love, Simon as soon as you can! This film has already become a cultural phenomenon of sorts, and deservedly so. Don't miss it! It's THAT good!","Love, Simon"

432,pirataboi,Finally... A coming of age Romantic Comedy who the lead character just so happens to be Gay!!,9,14 February 2019,"I can say without a doubt that I have seen a lot of LGBT movies because as a gay man, I long to see movies with LGBT characters in them. I love the feeling where I am able to relate to a character and getting to feel like I understand them. I for once do not want to finish a movie and always say, ""damn, the guy got the girl.. but what if they just made a movie where they guy got the guy or girl got the girl""This movie brought that and it wasn't cheesy like other lgbt movies, given there are cheesy moments, but they are great cheesy moments and they made it feel like everyday problems people could relate too. I was able to relate to the issues between Simon and his friends and how emotional he got and feeling like he was hitting rock bottom. This movie definitely took me on a ride from beginning to end of what some of us go through when you like someone. It was just another typical romantic comedy and that is what made it great.The music was great, the drama and conflict, the humor, the relationships between friends and so forth. It hit every emotion when watching it and that made it such a good movie to enjoy. I am always down for a non hollywood ending because sometimes life isn't a hollywood ending, but I do also enjoy a happy ending. I may not agree entirely on how the ending played out due to the message Simon was trying to portray about it being wrong to be outed and I feel like since he was outed and then came out it was now ok to try and out the guy he liked. Nonetheless it was great and such a great movie.","Love, Simon"

I was actually hoping for more of a 'The perks of being a wallflower' kind of movie.
But if you think about it, gay movies are always that kind of arthouse film.
And in that way it will always be a alternative subject.
I really liked this movie. It has a very 'Easy A' kind of vibe.
I did not mind all the clichés and the predictability.
What i did mind was the fact that Simon has a very perfect life. Beautiful friends, huge house with a perfect sister and perfect parents.
It was hard to feel sorry for Simon in the beginning. But ones I got sucked into the vibe and story, I dropped a few tears while smiling.","Love, Simon"

436,Aaroonio23,Perfection.,10,11 March 2018,"'Love, Simon.' This film.
I've never once seen a film that's so true, so relatable and so real. 
Every single character and every single storyline within this movie is so parallel to things that have happened in my own life it's crazy. 
This is a film that made me laugh out loud, made me reflect on my own life more than any other movie has ever done and made me cry openly with the actions and emotions that are on the screen so accurately portrayed and raw for the audience to see. 
This film tackles coming out and homophobia like no movie I have ever seen, this isn't just a singular story about how it feels to be gay, how it feels to come out to family and friends, it's an educational film that everyone should go watch.
They say in the movie like they feel like a Ferris wheel, sometimes they're on top of the world and other times they've hit rock bottom. This relates to me on every level.
Being gay and coming out are some of the hardest things to do (from personal experience) and this realisation and event in a persons life isn't always replicated or represented in a way that's true. 'Love, Simon' does this, it shows it how it was for me, how it was for so many and I'm so thankful that this film was made.
It's based on a book that I'm going straight out in the morning to buy and read because it's a story that I don't want to forget, it's a story I could have written myself, it's a story you all need watch.","Love, Simon"

It gave me interest in reading the book while waiting for it to be released. So i thought itll be a straight forward adaptation, but man i was wrong. The storyline and screen play were adjusted to fit a movie experience. Yes some details and situations were tweaked, but those still created impact and brought color to the movie. I liked the way how everyone was left hanging who Blue really was.. Simon imagining him to be from one person to another.. It's sad though that Cal want highlighted much, i kinda wished he was Blue when i was reading the book. But the Ferris Wheel scene was a great improvement from the book. From being low key in the book, to a coming out scene in the movie.","Love, Simon"

I identified with Simon (even though I finished high school in '84). The fear of losing your family and friends makes the secret you carry that much more of a burden. This movie helps us all find peace in ourselves and teach us to celebrate our unique traits. Put this down as a feel good classic that will endure. 
I'm happy I went.","Love, Simon"

It's an important little film but I feel it missed the mark completely and all the nice moments that are relatable for the most part are buried under the buzzfeed mediocre normalization of something that is exceptionally different for everyone in this situation. As a character story it's a pleasant hallmark movie, as a point of note in gay history, it's an already dated gentrification of what makes the diverse gay community so wonderful. Still glad it exists but also hope people make something better because it exists.","Love, Simon"

It was funny, heartfelt, and honest. I've been a big fan of Nick Robinson since his days on Melissa and Joey, but this was easily his best performance! I think he's extremely underrated and I can't wait to see what else he does in the future! Josh Duhamel and Jennifer Garner were great too as his parents! I loved the way this family was portrayed and it really made the movie work for me. All the actors playing his friends did an excellent job and Tony Hale as the vice principal was hilarious!This film did not pull any punches and really struck the audience with its message. Be who you are! I think this as great a message as any! Also, this film actually made me feel something. Too often we have these dry, emotionless comedies released that just want to get a few cheap laughs. This movie found a perfect balance of humor and emotion. It gives exactly what we all want - an actual story with real relatable characters! I would recommend this film to anyone. I was super impressed and will likely be seeing it again.","Love, Simon"

I think this movie is important for this generation and empowers the people who are struggling to accept themselves for who they are. Love Simon pushes boundaries, but always keeps it ""PG"". Recent movies such Moonlight and Call Me By Your Name are great, but the one downfall to them is that they are not very suitable for the younger audience.

It is also an important movie for families to see as it embodies challenges of the coming out process and provides a refreshing perspective on the acceptance.","Love, Simon"

455,Stunnedbird,"Any Reviewer Actually SEE this ""Movie""?",3,28 March 2018,"If the answer to that is yes, then let me pose this question. Have you actually seen any other movies? Because it seems to me that the only thing we're in agreeance on is that it is, by definition a movie, in the most liberal of terms.To give this film a 10/10 solely for the message of the film is ridiculous in itself but to do so without even realizing how backwards and redundant that message truly is, is also equally as preposterous. To feel any form of connection to this ""Product"" is as ridiculous as saying ""my microwave has done so much for Gay Culture and is the most important film of the year!"" (it's only March BTW). If anything my afore mentioned statement is actually false as your microwave will do more for gay culture than this movie by not caring if you're gay and providing actual entertainment. Because watching the run time is exactly what I did for this piece of crap but on a microwave it's not nearly as long.This Movie is set in a college application brochure where multi cultural caricatures come to life. These characters are indeed as one dimensional as the paper they're printed on and serve to show how Hollywood is trying to cash in on every form of culture there is, this time being the gay culture. No character development happens throughout the entire movie, The main character is an arrogant man, an unkind man who willingly deter's other peoples ""love"" for his own lust like some asshole cupid (he certainly is a baby). He has no revelation in his ways and at the end of the movie continues being an arrogant jerk. No sense of consequence is apparent for his actions whatsoever, and his friends take him back instantly. Just like sex the build up is long just for seemingly two minute climax, or at least that's what I can infer from my INCEL life. The conflict in this movie concludes as soon as it starts with the screenwriter seemingly trying to avoid tension or excitement any way he can. And since we're talking about ""the message of the movie"" I refuse to include being gay as a conflict as today in a liberal arts town where this movie takes place, it really shouldn't and isn't a problem. Movies like this where ther fear of being ""exposed"" as gay only create fear for people in similar situations. We have movies like Call Me By Your Name to show us that sexuality really doesn't matter anymore, it's the characters and the love which are the important parts, the parts that this movie glosses over. It treats being gay in the same light as Broke back Mountain but with a Happy ending which is, similar to my repeating of this word, REDUNDANT. And the way he gets back into his circle of friends is equally as gross, by somehow out Spaceying Kevin Spacey he just says ""I'm gay"" and boom, everything's better. Let me ask you this, do you really want some bull-crap fantasy movie made just to make everyone feel better, the studio hiring cheap TV Producers to direct; lining their pockets and audience members experiencing no emotional connection to lifeless characters besides ""HES GAY AND I LIKE GAY PEOPLE THEREFORE I LIKE HIM""? Because by supporting this, these are the types of movies we will continue to get. On a more technical noteDirecting - Bad Tv B-role stuff, over lighten to a ridiculous amount, no interesting shots or emotive cinematography, actors performances apparently not important to director either?Writing - Boring, unrealistic as they fall in love over the course of 12 emails, this is Charles Manson and Crazy wife levels of pen-pal-manship right here. At first the writing made some of the ""twists"" feel satirical because they were to obvious already to be revealed at the end of the damn movie.Acting - Main character has no charisma, think Ansel Elgort in Baby Driver with no interesting supporting characters or dynamic directing to support him. Also zero vocal control; very difficult to emote when you sound exactly the same in every situation. The only antagonist, theater kid (besides conservative America) really is the only somewhat decent actor which is weird as why are you making me care more about the manipulator than the manipulated.Soundtrack - Bland Tangerine Dream Ripoffs mixed with ridiculously overplayed hit songsoverall, Three out of ten. While I feel this movie is harmful for most viewers, maybe an older homophobic audience can get something out of this but this movie is just studio bait. Baiting a gay audience masterfully and therefore I will tell these Master Baiters to leave us alone with either fake reviews on IMDB or appealing to the lowest common denominator on IMDB... which I guess is me; since I did watch it in theaters.  P.S, IM GAY, but that doesn't justify anything really does it, Hidden Screenwriter Kevin Spacey?","Love, Simon"

i don't understand what this movie did to me, to my heart, to my life, but i can assure it was something amazing. 
the love story spoke directly to me and i honestly had no idea how much i needed this love story. it's not about finding yourself, it's about how to tell the world who you are. it's modern, it's timeless. which is why i tremendously related to this movie. most lgbt movies are about the struggles about coming out, not finding yourself, the negatives once you do find yourself and i loved and appreciated all those other movies but this was the first mainstream movie where he was comfortable with who he was he just needed a time and a place to tell the world his secret. 
hearing the entire sold-out audience in my missouri town explode into cheers, screams and clap made my heart warm up more than it has ever in any other movie. 
no complaints, this movie was perfect. i cannot wait to finally be able to buy it on itunes and watch it every night. 
the acting was a 10/10.
the changes from the book all worked perfectly and made the story flow better.
the high school atmosphere was spot on. 
again, thank you greg. thank you thank you thank you.

Simon isn't damaged; he's just a kid that deserves to be happy. The movie is a celebration of a human triumph, not in the movie itself but of the society that can finally produce it.

Especially having read the book and how smoothly the events unfolded in the written version, I feel like the film adaptation was not entirely believable, and mostly just cheesy.That being said, I would still recommend people watch it as some might enjoy it.

As i'm writing this review ( which does not say anything about the plot of the movie because, you really have to pull you're finger out of your behind and go watch Love, Simon now ) i am still unsure of my emotional state, the movie does a uber awesome job at taking you on an emotional roller coaster ride of many ups and downs ( kinda wished I had a pause button so that I could have taken a second to pull myself together ) that leaves you reeling and biting your nails in hopes that Jacques a.k.a Simon gets his happily ever after he so desperately wants.

471,kaleighrosemurphy,Simple and Good,8,25 March 2018,"Love, Simon is like another cliche heterosexual film for teenage audiences, except homosexual. Normally, these cliches are overused, and they are - a young teen struggling with self issues and friend problems because of their conflicting inner emotions - but cliche and normal is exactly what we need. The true welcoming of homosexuals into the world has been a long time coming, and these normal movies that deal with homosexual issues are perfect for that. The movie is light hearted, with several moments of comedic interlude, adorable, seriously, so cute it hurts, and still deals with and expresses the struggles that come with coming out. It's easy to digest and understand for those who haven't thought too much of it, and enjoyable for everyone. Would recommend.","Love, Simon"

I'm really disappointed that once again the underlining tone is you can be homosexual just not feminine and a person of color. Like the character Ethan (who's a little on the fem spectrum) has supposedly been out since freshman year and still four years later is being bullied, but Simon (who's presenting more in a hetero norm fashion) comes out and faces what appears to be a few days of taunting. Which ultimately results in him not only being accepted by practically everyone but he gets the guy too. C'mon smh. Also I found it quite upsetting how almost every guy wanted to jump Abby's bones.

To hear Simon say ""I'm gay"" is so important, we need those words not just implications. 2018 cinema is beginning to normalize these things that have been pushed to the side. Love, Simon is here to show us that being LGBT+ is completely okay and there is a happy ending to being a LGBT+ teen/kid. Content praise aside, the film succeeds as a rom-com, I laughed along with the audience at the clever jokes but also held back tears at the all-too-real events in the film. Casting was good, soundtrack was good, everything was very good. It's nice to see a movie with the main character being gay and not just be a flat character lacking depth. The main cast was also diverse instead of completely white-washed. 
All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It's another step in the right direction for cinema and I hope we continue this movement towards inclusion and representation.","Love, Simon"

477,clarkconners,A Good Ol' (Gay) Rom-Com--What Gay (American) Teens Have Needed for A Long Time,10,3 June 2018,"I'll start by saying that this is now one of my favorite movies, and I wish that I had a movie like this that was out while I was in middle/high school. This is the movie that not only gay American teens have needed and are now fortunate to have, but also what America, as a whole, needs. The story of the ""perfect"" suburban family having a gay child is the story that so many of us have lived, and yet it was all a secret, mostly kept from friends, family, and the public. Now that this very story is coming out in mainstream media, via a (I would say phenomenal, others might say cliché) 90s rom-com style film, it's very telling how far the LGBTQ+ community in America has come (though the road to go is still long). Before I watched the movie, I remember reading a review by a journalist that said--and I'm paraphrasing--that it was ""nothing more than another cheesy rom-com, but that's a good thing."" And I think that's an excellent way of putting it...except I actually genuinely love the movie. I love it because of how spot on it was about living in the closet as an American teen growing up in a suburb with a seemingly perfect life. You really did have to ""hold your breath"" your whole life and never felt like you could be your true self. You had to grin and bare it when your friends or family made those jokes about ""gays,"" and pretend to laugh along. You couldn't have the same kind of teen crushes your straight friends had and you couldn't talk about them with your friends--heck, even if one day you could, you wouldn't even know how because you'd never done it before...very similar to Simon in the movie. I love this movie because it's one step closer to normalizing a gay experience. I highly, highly recommend this movie, not only to LGBTQ+ people, not only to parents with gay children, but to everyone who enjoys a good old-fashioned romantic comedy.","Love, Simon"

Of course, I'm biased, because my life was just like Simon's, but nonetheless. This movie so beautifully portrays what so many of us have went through. There are so many relatable parts, like having a father or guy friends who are always making jokes about cute girls to you, and you love them because you know they're well-intentioned but deep down you let out a huge sigh because you wish you weren't different and that they could understand. Or when Simon says, ""I don't know why I didn't come out. Deep down, I knew my family and friends would accept me. Maybe I just wanted to hold on to what I had a little longer. Maybe I wasn't ready for change.""I think every straight person should see this movie so they can understand a little better what so many LGBTQ people have experienced.","Love, Simon"

483,emrumboldt,"Thank you, 'Love, Simon'",10,13 April 2018,"""Love, Simon"" is perhaps the only film of late to have completely lived up to, if not surpassed, the heaps of positive critique it has received. I had braced myself for a cheesy, campy high school flic stuffed with gay stereotypes and borderline offensive humour; what I got was, in fact, a masterpiece. Sensitive and highly aesthetic, I got vibes from the movie which I can only describe as 'Perks of Being a Wallflower' mashed with '13 Reasons Why' - the latter may well be due to the knockout cast, which includes the hit Netflix drama's Katherine Langford and Miles Heizer. I laughed. I cried. I cried some more. For me, the film was the closest thing to perfection that modern cinema has to offer. It is, quite simply, stunning.More importantly is the message the film portrays. Watching 'Love, Simon' with three of my best friends, I was transported back to a time when things were much less simple. Nick Robinson perfectly portrays the fear of coming out or being outed; this is SUCH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE, no matter who is watching. This is the kind of representation our community needs. I can't help but think that, had this movie been released when I was younger, I and so many others could have been saved from a heap of trauma brought about by ignorance and homophobia. Thank you, 'Love, Simon', for being a perfect role model for the kids of today.","Love, Simon"

As a 35 year old gay man, I don't think I've ever connected with a movie quite like this before - I felt like I was watching my own coming out story on the big screen, and there is something so magical about that. I am an avid fan of romantic comedies, but this one really pulled me in. The cast is incredible - and Nick Robinson truly shines in the lead role. He captures the inner conflict and the self-doubt and the fear and longing, and all those other emotions that surface when dealing with one's identity. He does this in a way that will relate to many viewers, which I think is intentional. Throughout the film, as Simon wrestles with his sexuality he ultimately must face the fall-out when others find out the truth. When this happens, you see an outpouring of support and love and acceptance. This too, is powerful, and brings tears to my eyes as I write this! At the climax of the movie, when Simon finds out who his mystery pen pal is, you can feel the entire audience take a breath and gasp. As they kiss, everyone around me is cheering - and so am I. We deserve a movie like this - a movie where you can see a gay man kiss another gay man out of pure love and joy.This movie was made for people of all ages, colors, and sexuality - and we deserve it. I only wish I had a movie like this when I was grappling with my own coming out drama!Go out and see this beautiful gem. You deserve it - we all do!","Love, Simon"

486,guillermoesmi,This movie is just... the best thing.,10,16 March 2018,"A journalist for Time Magazine wrote an article about this movie and stated that teens today don't need this movie; that in 2018 individuals like Simon have a good chance of fitting in, and it is unnecessary. Let me begin by saying he is wrong. This, first off, was a fantastic movie. It had a great mix of comedy, drama, and romance. That is something that is sorely lacking in LGBT film today. Many of them are far to serious and dramatic (""Call me by your name"", ""The Normal Heart"", Etc.) or are so flamboyant and ridiculous that no one can relate to it, but it is still a good movie (""Birdcage""). This is the only film that I have encountered that accurately portrays ones fears of coming out of the closet, and being in the closet trying to just survive high school. What this Time writer doesn't realize is that coming out is not just about ""fitting in"". In fact, many individuals coming out in high school worry because they are essentially painting a target on their back for bullying. It's terrifying because there are ultraconservative parents who kick their children out based on sexual orientation. Friends that get weird because they think ""What if this person thinks of me in that way?"". Coming out changes the dynamic between you and the people around you, and some people become hostile towards LGBT youth. Whenever I myself came out with my first boyfriend on Facebook someone from his friends list messaged me and told me ""What you are doing is wrong"". The fact that someone who is a complete stranger felt comfortable confronting me on my sexual orientation and thought it was their business to lecture me was just absurd. But anyway, as Simon said in the trailer for the movie, ""announcing who you are to the world can be pretty scary"", and I think really that is why this film is important. It reminds people that while coming out is terrifying, all that matters is that you are happy with who you are.","Love, Simon"
487,superskinna,Slow and unmemorable,3,18 August 2018,"This movie made an hour feel like two. The dialogue was boring and disgenuine, and the characters overall very underdeveloped and hollow, it didn't feel like a group of friends talking to each other, but more like a student film with a big budget.Having lived life as a gay teen, being in the same boat as Simon, I can't say I felt any connection to him at all. The story makes him seem like a wet towel that wont stand up to blackmail and cowers from the thought that people might actually not like him.The entire premise of the movie is this: Gay teen forgets to log out of the subtley advertised Google Mail and gets blackmailed by an unusual person, who is used as a comedy piece throughout, and instead of going to the police or any of the School's staff he decides to try and force a romance on his friend to save his own skin. All the while, he's chatting away on his subtely advertised Apple Macbook to this anonymous homosexual through heavily featured Gmail.The story is very simple but very dragged out, and for the hour that I actually had any interest in the film I remember very little about it. And I watched it just half and hour ago. It is very pushy on the fact that its a GAY romance and makes sure you know it, but incorrectly represents what it is actually like to be a gay youth, or a youth in general.In conclusion, this movie was like a boring, unnecessarily lengthened, dull, homosexual remake of Easy A... but without the comedy, redeeming protagonist, or memorable story, targeted assumedly at the current state of homosexuality being a trendy and profitable market.","Love, Simon"

493,jacochrane,This kid thinks he has the average childhood! Are you joking?,1,18 November 2018,"This movie has been playing 0.9 minutes and it is far from realty that I'm turning it off RIGHT NOW!
This child star, Nick Robinson, has grown into a beautiful young boy. I don't know old he is. I may be acting inappropriately. He says he's the average kid. Ok let me see, he lives in a beautiful home with gorgeous beyond swords, parents, Jennifer Garner is his mother and Josh Duhamel is his father. No one to have concerns for weight gain. They could never gain pound or two. He has an adorable, talented sister. I mean don't we all? He gets a car for a birthday. And there was no duct tape in view on this car. So, he beat me at that one. He has three best friends and they all happen to be beautiful too. Surprise! None of them have any eating disorders, everyone is always at their pecfect weight.I can't stand it anymore, it may have been a good movie, but guy that plays the main character needs to a little more awkward, and his family don't need to be into each other as much, and everyone just stop being so nice to his family. When it comes to his friends, maybe a best friend transgender, maybe it could've been a quirky movie about an insecure kid who needs to let his friends and family that he is gay. It should've been a better movie. And this review will circulate to all other reviews.","Love, Simon"

495,markq-36556,Love....,9,26 October 2018,"Love Simon isn't just your average teenage, coming of age film. It is a film set in modern day society. The social media age. The film follows a character named Simon on his everyday life. Simon is just like many other teenagers who have their own problems and secrets. Except, Simon has a secret he has kept for some time.... he's homosexual. This genre of film tends to follow the same trends and storylines and this is where this movie stands apart from the rest. The supporting actors are fantastic, in particular Katherine Langford as Simon's lifelong best friend. The pacing of the film is fantastic and even when there are scenes of pure dialogue the story keeps us in its grasp. Nick Robinson delivers the best performance of his career so far in this film and continues to show how much of a talented actor he is. The film is the most enjoyable I have watched in a long time full of great character arc's and performances. Love, Simon is an extremely enjoyable movie from start to finish!","Love, Simon"
496,toriclaudio,Love this movie,10,16 March 2018,So I read the book and had been a Lil worried about this adaption but it was so good. It did the book justice! I felt like I was with Simon along the whole way! This movie captured the awkwardness of high school perfectly. Definitely a must see,"Love, Simon"
497,dayletleyva,Great start to a long road ahead,9,11 March 2018,"Let me preface by saying this movie was incredible. Amazing casting, very poignant conversations, and funny one liners. If you're not looking at it from a socio-political standpoint, it's a great feel good movie. A movie that's been long over due. Where some of the short comings occur is when the movie strikes a tone deaf chord. Some instances were Simons friends and not grasping the quandary he was in. The vice principal was a caricature of a person, and as a person in authority, I would've preferred for him to have become someone a teen in that situation could feel safe and validated with...not someone who at the first instance says ""well we're not alike like that"". Thankfully there was Ms. Albright! She was incredible!
Also, the joke about being ""too gay"" no cool. There's no ""too"" anything. Especially when you're trying to build a space for movies that depict all walks of life from all types of individuals. And to be honest, not in love with the whole blackmail aspect, although I guess I can understand why you'd need it as a story arc. I know it may seem like I am bashing the movie, but I am really not. The family was incredible. The friends, once they got their act together, were really supportive. Bless Ms. Albright and IT HAS A HAPPY ENDING! Wish it was longer though....But like I said, it's a great start but we have a long way to go before movies like these can become the norm. Where everyone gets their happy ending and feels like they can let the world know their secret.","Love, Simon"

It truly is such a wonderful movie and you will leave feeling heartfelt towards it. Sexuality aside, it is a heartwarming romcom that will touch your heart, make you laugh and maybe even cry. This film is truly groundbreaking for the LGBT community and will certainly get everyone talking. It is the film that the gay community has been waiting for and I am sure will change and possibly save the lives of anyone struggling with their sexuality. So many people left with tears in their eyes and I cannot wait to see it again. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for that romcom to pluck at their heart strings. #loveislove.","Love, Simon"

 Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda
written by Becky Albertalli
 
So I just finished watching Love Simon and I am infuriated. Typically I avoid saying the cliché that ""the book was better than the movie"", but I cannot hold back this time because THE BOOK IS BETTER! It's so much better. I love Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, and I was looking forward to the movie because I was excited to see the qualities that make the book special represented on screen for a wider audience to see. Nope. It's one thing when the movie makes basic changes from the source material, adds or subtracts a minor","Love, Simon"
503,saikatroy-70640,A very very special movie...please go watch it with your family and friends!!!,9,11 March 2018,"Saw the special preview in Canada today. I have to say, this is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. So pure, so fresh, so heartwarming and so authentic. Reminded me of the struggles that I went through as a teenager, trying to come out and just to connect with someone who would understand what I was experiencing. I cried and laughed with the characters, specially Simon. I went in thinkng I was going to watch a good movie, came out with a heart filled with tenderness and joy. This movie is overflowing with moments which will make you proud of who you are. A definite must-watch. And not just for the LGBT community. 9/10","Love, Simon"

This was probably the first movie where I truly felt represented accurately. Not only that, but my straight friends loved it too. It's comedic, heartwarming, and hilariously awkward in that way only a highschool movie can be, but it's executed perfectly.","Love, Simon"

A great piece of work - this movie is exactly what everyone needs to see right now.","Love, Simon"
511,garrettschooling-90940,Beautiful and heartwarming,10,17 March 2018,"I feel like so many LGBTQ themed movies are depressing, and many of them do not end well. I absolutely loved the book on which this movie is based, and the movie does a fantastic job of living up to the book. Nick Robinson plays the part of Simon beautifully, and the supporting cast is also excellent. I walked away from this movie feelings good and feeling encouraged. For a movie of this topic, it's refreshing to see it handled with such openness, acceptance, and honesty. I hope to see more movies like this. And Nick Robinson certainly deserves an award for his performance. He was fantastic.","Love, Simon"

513,jacinthorvath,Fascinating expression of love,10,21 March 2018,"Love, Simon is a truly magnificent collection of joyful moments of teen years. It focuses more on captivating the feeling of love rather than stereotypical ideas of different sexual orientations. Whether straight or gay, you fall in love with the movie's power. It surpasses expectations beyond all that I could want from a groundbreaking and truthful motion picture. Nick and Katherine brought quality to the screen, and so did all the others. Great night out!","Love, Simon"

515,huynguyend,Worths every single penny.,10,9 May 2018,"As a LGBTQ+ supporter who acknowledges that people still hold a certain prejudice towards gay people in general, I didn't expect that much from the movie industry to finally release a film which reflects how the youth, more specifically teenagers deal with figuring out their sexual orientations. To my surprise, 'Love, Simon' made me immediately think about it again, and I didn't hesitate coming to the cinema to watch it at once.
Not only does the movie makes the audiences share sympathetic feelings with main character Simon when it comes to his first love and coming out progress, but it also successfully puts a smile on their faces because of a sweet love story of the two teenagers. I couldn't help myself but smiled gracefully when the movie came to an end, and the viewers behind my row began to burst into cheers and applause. It felt like my faith in love, in the good outcomes of coming out and in positive perspectives of the community is finally recovered.
Like Simon said, 'everyone deserves a great love story', I hope everyone will take this as your motto in life and start making important decisions to pursue your love, be yourself and live happily. Maybe I will too. If you haven't watched the movie yet, I would strongly recommend this and please grab yourself a ticket right away for a chance to drown yourself in this cute and amiable movie. A smile guaranteed!","Love, Simon"

It never occurs to me that a young man's coming out would be so touching. This movie makes me laugh and makes me cry. I am never a homophobic kind of person. Yet I don't usually like to watch boy-kiss-boy sort of scene. This must be Nick Robinson's charm that does the trick. I totally love it.,"Love, Simon"

This film is entirely relatable for anyone who has been in high school. Viewers don't need to share Simon's exact problems in order to enjoy this film. That's what makes it so special! The characters are all well-thought out and the story is very funny, interesting, and emotional. This is a film for everyone!","Love, Simon"
520,dennisgranhugg,i liked it,8,15 July 2018,"The movie was amazing, i have watched it 4 times now and i still love it the same. the main reason i liked this movie (still like it) is because, well maybe you guessed it... im gay! well, i know im gay but no one else knows and i felt like this movie helped me to figure out who i am.but if you are looking for a good movie, well. you found it.","Love, Simon"
521,ladylebron,Perfect,10,14 March 2018,"I have never stood up after watching a movie and turned around to see as many LGBTQ identified people crying ever. This a movie for all audiences, but is a momumental movie for us (LGBTQ) as it represents ACTUAL feelings that come with coming out, and being gay all together. The act of Simon being blackmailed is sadly accurate for many people, so many are scared to lose their friends after admitting to themselves and them that they are gay, and are used for that secret. The 80's themed music, and modern showcase of teenage relationships is amazing, the most memorable part of the movie is Simon kissing Blue, as it wasn't half ass, it was REAL. I have never watched a movie that made LGBTQ feel this amazing and represented all at once. Thank you Love, Simon for finally giving me the strength to com out to my family.","Love, Simon"

523,rubyslavin,Best Movie of 2010s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,17 March 2018,"Hands down, Love, Simon was one of the BEST movies I have EVER watched, in the 14 years of my life here on Earth. I haven't felt this emotional. Being in the theatre, when every time the two kissed, and everyone clapping, it was just so heartwarming. This era, this generation - 2018, needed this. It was so cool to hear everyone in the theatre laugh, cry and to see them smile. It had me crying the whole second half it it made me feel so uplifted and inspired. It was so heartfelt and heartwarming and just made me laugh, cry and smile. This movie. I just can't put it into words!!! It was so pure.","Love, Simon"
524,grayceruthp,DROP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING AND GO SEE IT RIGHT NOW!!,10,18 March 2018,"Having been someone who read the book that Love, Simon is based on, I was concerned that it would be just another movie loosely based off the novel. MAN WAS I WRONG! Now, the movie did tweak some details in the book, but it beautifully represents the novel in a way that I don't see very often in book-to-movie adaptations! Everyone who read Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda will LOVE Love, Simon and those who didn't read the book will still love the movie. Even if you aren't part of the LGBTQ+ community, you will still be able to relate to the message of Love, Simon. It has all the heart of a coming-of-age/romance story without being cheesy and overly cliche. Likewise, it beautifully showcases a gay teen's experience with coming out and falling in love without falling into stereotypical tropes. I also enjoyed the two scenes Simon has with his parents after coming out, I think that's something every person wants to hear after coming out and I'm happy they included it in the film (have the tissues at hand for those scenes). Overall, the film carries the same heart of a classic coming-of-age film while holding true to one's coming out experience. I'm so happy to see this kind of representation for the LGBTQ+ community and I hope films like Love, Simon are readily produced in the future. 
All in all, just please go see Love, Simon! It's so worth your time!! 
SPOLIERS AHEAD! DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK OR SEEN THE MOVIE YET! Love, Simon is worth it solely for the ferriswheel scene with Simon and Bram. The scene is so genuine and lovely! Be prepared to squeal or cry or clap or cheer or all 4!","Love, Simon"

527,usedshamwow,"A well-needed, important movie for LGBT kids",7,26 March 2018,"""Love, Simon"", without a doubt, is an extremely important and long overdue film. LGBT kids, especially those still in the closet, will find immense inspiration and relief watching a character in a mainstream film they can really, truly relate to go through a lifelong struggle with sexuality that is portrayed in a realistic, accurate way. That being said, there were a few issues with the film that I think could really take people out of the movie and could have easily been fixed/prevented.When Simon's friends find out he was messing with their emotions and actions to help Martin, their reactions were the exact opposite of realistic, which contradicted how realistic and believable the characters' friendship and interactions were up until this point. I am also a senior in high school and I can't think of any reason my friends would turn their backs on me and completely abandon me when they find out I was forced, BLACKMAILED, into doing terrible things by the creepy, skeevy kid of the school that would be fully expected to pull something like that. This part of the movie felt like an extremely lazy way to force in a low point, and the movie could have definitely done without ripping all of his friends from him for no real reason.","Love, Simon"

529,liam_hill,One of the Best Coming of Age Yet,9,27 March 2018,"My partner and i were mentally braced for the typical corny cringe moments and drama that usually surrounds teen movies however apart from the crowd scene towards the end, we were very pleasantly surprised. This movie is filled with very genuine and relate-able behavior and situations and it rings of authenticity from experiences lived. The reactions of the parents down to the internal drama and conflict Simon experiences lends a lot of insight into the stresses of coming to terms with your sexuality, how it defines you and how it will affect your family life and friends.I would happily watch this again in fact i am keen to. Absolute kudos to Nick Robinson for a stunning performance, and I just can't skip over the very convincing emotional moments from the parents Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel. For anyone who has had similar experiences, these bits are real tear jerkers!Highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen it to go watch it!","Love, Simon"

I have to say I absolutely loved the film. The audience at the theater was really into it and it felt like we all went there together. Everyone enjoyed it and by the end we had a standing ovation. I recommend this film to everyone! It's great for parents as well, and I would really suggest they see it!","Love, Simon"
532,macyxanime,An accurate representation,10,8 April 2018,"This really sent me on an emotional roller coater, probably more than it should have.This movie shows what LGBT+ truly feels like, You're scared to come out even though you know it'll be fine, that feeling that it'll change everything and everything will tumble down. And then there is also the fact that the main character is REALLY just a normal guy, except he's gay. It shows that gay people don't have to be super flamboyant to be gay. Also, this is just me fangirling, I love Simon's character. He's just SO very real. He's laid back, jokes with his friends, is awkward at times, and is just funny lol. Anyway, that's my two cents, and I would suggest this movie to any and all LGBT+ kids out there and also any parents or classmates of those kids who need to be educated some. I would also recommend it to any homophobic people too, but I know most of them would never watch it so yeah.","Love, Simon"

534,griffdori,It was good...,7,10 April 2018,"Before you read this, note that this whole review is basically just an opinion.
I have to say... this movie was breathtaking, and man - I'm going to get some hate for this - but it was very complicated and a little disappointing. What I mean, is that I think it could have been filmed a bit better near the end. Don't get me wrong, the ending was beautiful and emotional, but it felt rushed. Near the end, the cinematography lost it's simplicity from the start of the film. The movie could have had a little more content from the book, not that it has to be exactly like the book, but it didn't portray the scenes that were based off the book very well. It felt like they were trying to drive all the originality from the book away, which is not bad, I'm just stating that they could of used the ideas from the book more, and tried to develop it, other than trying to avoid it completely. When all those people were applauding Simon in the ferris wheel scene, I honestly thought that was a vacuous and a completely doltish idea. I'm not a film-expert, but I'm not very witless either, and what I'm saying is that the way that scene was filmed was not as impressing as other scenes. It was supposed to a romantic, loving scene, but I felt like they turned it into a mocking fantasy. In my opinion - It would've been a lot better if they didn't have that mob of high school students clapping in the background. The script was quite complex and complicated to follow, the way it was written was very plain and very muted. 
Anyway, I'm not hating on this movie because I'm discriminating gay people, I'm just judging on the way it was filmed. I'm just a teenager so don't judge my writing skills either. I was just very excited to see this movie, I was really hyped up when I heard there was a movie being made about my favourite book (I read this back in 2016), but it turned out to have a lot of minor disappointments in my favourite parts of the story. Thanks if you're reading this and don't think I'm a complete idiot! :)","Love, Simon"

539,tyrellbibbiani,I left the cinema finally feeling represented,10,24 April 2018,"When me and my other LGBTQ+ friend entered the screening for this movie, we had very low expectations. But we were very wrong to do so.The film was an amazingly heartfelt, accurate and extremely emotional representation of our community, hitting all of the emotions in all of the right ways. I remember originally feeling very cynical of this film as I was apprehensive at the fact that a Hollywood-like film would really misrepresent our community. However, that was not the case.The film managed to accurately capture how young LGBTQ+ teens would feel pre-coming out, which was great as many people in the community could relate very well to the lead character - Simon. I for one could definitely relate to Simon's position, which made me feel a deeper connection to the film more than I had with any other film.I personally loved the level of different representations of people throughout. Not only was there a lead LGBTQ+ character, but there was also representations of black Americans of different sizes which were great.I believe that in the years to come this film will become a cult-classic and it will indeed become a triumphant, important and a much-needed film for all young LGTBQ+ kids to see and finally feel represented in such a normal and mainstream way. Love, Simon deserves all of its success and the best thing about this film is absolutely ANYONE can enjoy this film and relate to it in some way.","Love, Simon"

541,darrell-johnson,Potentially life-saving,9,19 March 2018,"Do you know that even today, gay teens are 6-8x more likely to try to kill themselves than straight teens? That's why my review title is no exaggeration. It so happens that my 15-year old son came out to me three days ago...and today we saw ""Love, Simon"" together in a theatre. The timing couldn't be better: he's about to change schools due to his anxiety and due to several situations similar to ones shown in this film. He loved it. We both wept, we laughed, and he told me he was amazed how quickly the movie passed: there was never a moment he was bored. The cast is universally likeable and authentic and the actor playing 'Simon' captures the heartbreak, fear, and potential joy of being gay. One thing different about this movie than some previous independent films: although coming out as gay is presented as difficult because you're in a small minority, it is not shown as something shameful. I would recommend this movie for pretty well anybody: gay teens and young adults of course, but also parents of gay and potentially-gay kids, and straight kids who just want to understand what it's like. A poignant, fun, witty, and important movie.","Love, Simon"

543,secretpluxavier,"Real, relevant, realistic and rewarding",10,19 May 2018,"Unlike most of the LGBT movies that I've watched, focus too much on love and sex, and I don't know why, mostly ended with very sad ending which really annoys me the most.Simon reminds me how hard I tried to hide my identity especially during my high school time, always thought that I was abnormal, and worried all the possible discrimination that I'd face. Always thought of maybe someday I'll love women and get married. But deep inside my heart, I know I born this way, and I'll never in love with any woman. I even thought of getting married with a lesbian to get away from being pressured by my family for marriage. How silly...I was just like Simon, seeking for ""The One"" who is just like me having and sharing the same secret. One step further but three steps back just because of worrying he isn't and everything will be revealed.Today, I've a bf who love me so much, have few friends who know who I am and always love the way I am. Just to tell the world, we've done nothing wrong, we never hurt someone, and is never been a choice to us, because we just born this way. Love, Simon did a good job in showing our worries, difficulties and most part, our mental struggle. I really hope this movie can help those still behind the closet to fight with it and overcome it, instead of taking self-destruction approach. Definitely is my favourite movie of 2018!","Love, Simon"

Even if you don't like romantic comedies or dramas, you will like this one. In my opinion it is the best movie of 2018. Why? Because it's a movie. This can't have a sequel. Not like the Avengers or Deadpool which can be milked to infinity. Not saying that those are bad movies.The movie is 10/10 go watch it ASAP.","Love, Simon"
551,abilu-29867,Loved Simon,8,17 June 2018,"So touched and present exactly what I thought about LGBT. I mean why people who is gay or lesbian or other need to come out.We r just human. And love is about two hearts not two genders.Simon is so lucky as he said himself, he is loved.btw the music in this movie is wonderful","Love, Simon"
552,oltenbox,Best love story ever!,10,30 June 2018,Such a great movie. I have never seen I movie like this. The actors are fabulous and the story is amazing. My absoulte favourite movie so far.,"Love, Simon"
553,ottos-61113,Not worth the re-watch. Ever.,2,9 July 2018,"Love, Simon - A movie that lacks any feel of realism, it's humor is pure hollywood with no depth. And the emotional development of the characters are non-existent, every line given in the movie was predictable, almost as if the most cliché thing that comes to your mind is his next line. The ""Drama"" was over-exaggerated, and was re-solved in a matter of minutes.. The theme of the movie is very relevant, but ended in an anti-climactic last scene, that flatlined any last hope this movie held.Love, Anonymous...","Love, Simon"
554,gabriellt-42837,This movie all the people have to watch,10,14 July 2018,"This movie make my life so better, the only thing i have to say it's Thank You. I'm gay and i watch this movie with my family, in this day i come out to my family. This movie it's so similiar to the book all the people have to read the book. And the actors it's so good, i don't have nothing to told worst about the actors. Love, Gabriel.","Love, Simon"
555,shorrockpeter,"I'm a straight white 40 yr old male, married with 3 kids, and I loved this movie",9,15 July 2018,"I knew nothing about this movie before I watched it. My wife heard it was great, gave me a brief synopsis of what it was about, so I said sure why not. I planned on catching up on some work emails while it was on in the background.Holy shit - I loved this flick. I thought it was awesome. I'm a sucker for romcoms anyway, but this movie had me laughing hysterically at points, then tearing up at others. Also, I didn't get any work done - my eyes were glued to the screen.The acting was fantasic - the kid that played Simon was so likeable. His parents were so fun to watch, and that speech his Mom gave him made me fight back some tears. The soundtrack was great, the pace was perfect, and it was just a fun damn movie to watch.Now, mind you, I'm a middle aged white dude, married with three little girls, who leans Republican, and voted for Trump. Say what you want... this was a great movie.Trying to raise my girls in this world, they are young and don't know the social difference between race, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, etc. My point is, I think this movie is important, and when they become old enough, I want them to see Love, Simon, not as a ""gay"" movie"", but just another romantic comedy that happens to have a main character who is gay and is trying to find himself. That simple.Love, Simon, in my opinion, will go down in history as a great/memorable teenage flick like ""Say Anything"", ""Reality Bites"", ""Can't Hardly Wait"", etc.A fun, well acted movie, with awesome music that made me laugh, cry, and really root for the main character...who just so happens to be gay. And in my mind, and hopefully my kids' minds, is as normal as anything..","Love, Simon"
556,sovariadam,Ten stars out of ten,10,18 July 2018,"This movie is more important than you think. If you just think, something is hard to tell, just watch this film. It helped me a lot get trough hard times, and I think everyone who is struggling with these ""problems"" should watch this movie. 
Thanks for everyone, who made this film.","Love, Simon"
557,moracampetella,Worthless,2,26 July 2018,"I can't understand how is it that most of the people love this movie. I found it pretty boring, because THERE'S NOTHING REALLY GOING ON, I mean there's no plot or at least a worth developing plot. He's gay, right, and that's it, like the whole movie goes around this issue (which is obvious cuz that is what the movie is about) but it could have been told in a hundred more interesting ways, not in a teenager cliche using emails. Besides, these emails, which are the 'romantic' tool, are supposed to make you feel sorry for the main character and build a bond between you and him so that you can understand his feelings, because that is how it works. However, they are worthless, they do not make you feel any pity or love or anything. These emails are meant to be mind blowing because they are the only way in which Simon can express his feelings and struggles, as non of his mates know about his true sexuality, but poorly they aren't. They are missing a spark.
The ending is lovely, as the guy who he exchanged emails with decides to go out and finally show the world his inner self, by meeting Simon and kissing him, which I found really cute. But when I saw it was him, I couldn't remember who he was! This guy only appears a couple of times throughout the movie, mainly at the beginning, and then he disappears. You are not familiarized with this character, so my reaction was some kind of 'Who the hell is this guy and where did he come from?'
Something that was awful as well was the reaction of his BEST FRIENDS! When they find out he is gay, they don't give a crap about it, though they know how lonely and desperate Simon was feeling. They are just mad because he had lied to them, and that's undeniably true: he messed up. But if you are his best friend, you do not leave him alone at his worst. Besides, the way in which everyone found out he was gay was no cool at all, so they should have at least first asked him ARE YOU OK? But they didn't, and it was pretty rude.
I expected so much more from this movie.","Love, Simon"
558,sabellina_kaine,I'd want part 2!,10,27 July 2018,"After I've read that the protagonist is a gay, it gets my curiosity and wanted me to watch it especially I'm a gay guy. It really gives me a romantic excitement and also a feeling of envy. How I hope that they'd always make a movie like this. Inspiring us and opening our minds that after a rain there a sunshine.Loved, Dota 2","Love, Simon"
559,lunyo-62992,"Important movie, but book readers might be frustrated",8,29 July 2018,"I'm writing this review as a reader of the eponymous book.This movie is important. Had I been 17, I would have watched it over and over again till I knew all the damn lines. I will help some young teenagers, with whom I am working as a teacher, to come out and identify with a gay character presented in a very light way.Let's deal with the positive points very quickly, as it had been said over and over again in the other reviews:
It's a heartwelming, well-paced, fun and important movie.Camera is on point, cinematography is pretty good.Acting is alright.
The main things we regret are:
The classic tropes of teen-movies that I think should not have been there.The fact that they are all beautiful. I mean, come on, they are teens.The movie differs a bit from the book, and sometimes it did better, sometimes it butchered some characters.(spoilers alert)
Leah might be the most butchered character in the show. They just erased her entire backstory. Also, she is played by the same actress who plays Hannah Baker in 13 Reasons Why, and I'm guessing they asked her to be just like Hannah because I could not see the damn difference. She is a big deal in the book, and her problems are much deeper than just 'I'm in love with you Simon'. She was eclipsed by every single character in the show, even damn Cal (played by another actor from 13 RW)Martin: on the other hand, they did a great job with Martin who just steals the show in every single scene he is in, and even in some he is not. Also they removed the ""gay brother"" thingy in the book that I did not like (Martin got pressured by his gay brother to apologize, in some way) and gave a fully-fleshed character, much more likeable than the book one. He never is a villain, and I love the fact that he asked Simon to sleep over. Good call.Nora: I don't know how to feel about her. She is entirely different in the show. They did not develop her, which is pretty frustrating, and the cooking thing seems gadget.It's too bad that we don't get the whole conversation with Bram about how he has been fancying him since day 1 and was hoping that Jacques was Simon the whole time. They just made him the hot dream jock who becomes the hot dream gay jock at the end, but we don't know much about him, and it seems somewhat unbelievable that he wrote all the things on the computer.Overall, it is a great movie, but if you are not a teenager or a student, it will be difficult to actually get the full experience of Love, Simon, because it is really a book made for teenagers, to help those teenagers, and the movie is the same.
If you are a fan of the book, get ready to be disappointed by some characters.","Love, Simon"
560,bonneras-42876,FAVORITE MOVIE,10,16 August 2018,I watched this movie on a long plane ride and it was an amazing movie. It is a modern love story and I think it's great for the main character simon to be gay.,"Love, Simon"
561,arnelchristians,Cute and Powerful Story,10,28 August 2018,"A really powerful movie that defiantly got the tears going and going out of the cinema I was just in so much shock and it's really nice to see the LGBT+ community being represented in such a cute movie!
The book is amazing and the author: Becky Albertalli is an amazing person!That being said, I would recommenced everyone watch it because it is so amazing and uplifting!","Love, Simon"

566,androntron,A true love story!,9,1 January 2019,"I just loved the film! It is cute and romantic as dramas should be! Yes, it has lots and lots of clichés which do not make it any worse. I loved the acting, it was more than decent and I mostly loved the characters.Simon is depicted as a truly usual teen with all of his imperfections and insecurities, one of which is the fact that he is gay. Well now try to reveal that to everyone...to say that you are not what others think of you! And that's the challenge of the film. It's simple and it works!The antagonist. He is mean. And I wanted to kill him right away. So we all can agree that he did his job at being very bad. However I did not like some things about him. Well firstly, the absolute absence of morals and I mean there is not even a sign. He is just plain evil and nothing else. He says a line somewhere at the end that he didn't want to (spoilers incoming!!!) reveal the sexual orientation of Simon and that was pretty much it, so yeah...but I put that into the cliche category.And the story itself. Oh my goodness I was crying at the end! That was the cutest thing I have seen in recent times. That's truly a love story and it is shown the way it should be! And the overcoming yourself thing just makes it much better!Just to sum up, if you want to cry about gay love, well, then that's the film you're looking for! Cute, naive, with a strong message and overall good film! I had a great time watching it","Love, Simon"

571,goferba-34622,one character almost destroys a film with many virtues,6,1 January 2020,"A good comedy about a gay kid who hiddens his gayness with plenty of good lines almost ruined by the character of Martin that blackmail Simon to tell everyone his secret if he didn't help him to get close to a friend, a character that seems coming from another film, a bad one. That character is the main flaw of a film with an excellent message and with no drama, a rare thing for a LGTB movie","Love, Simon"
