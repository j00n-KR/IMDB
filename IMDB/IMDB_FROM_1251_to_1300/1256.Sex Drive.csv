0,SnoopyStyle,Raunchy teen sex comedy road trip,7,26 March 2014,"Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a suffering virgin high school senior in Chicago. His brother Rex (James Marsden) is always picking on him. His best friends are best-girl Felicia (Amanda Crew) and smart-mouthed Lance (Clark Duke). When his online girl Ms_Tasty offers to go all the way, he steals Rex's 69 GTO to go on a cross country trip to Knoxville with Felicia and Lance.The three leads have great chemistry and are charming together. Josh is wonderfully dorky. Amanda is super sweet. Clark is brilliantly talky. The sex talk is especially raunchy. James Marsden is trying a little too hard. Most of the humor works. It's a raunchy teen sex comedy road trip that is better than most.",Sex Drive
1,claudio_carvalho,I Am Still Laughing,8,31 July 2009,"In the suburb of Chicago, the eighteen year-old Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a naive and virgin teenager that is mocked by his homophobic brother Rex (James Marsden) and his schoolmates; his best friends are Felicia (Amanda Crew) and the wolf Lance (Clark Duke). When Ian meets a girl called Tasty (Katrina Bowden) in Internet, he writes many lies about himself; when she invites him to drive to Knoxville, Tennessee, to have sex with her, Ian steals Rex's GTO Judge 1969 and travels with Lance and Felicia. When they have trouble on the road with the car, the Amish Ezekiel (Seth Green) offers to help them in his community. Lance meets the Amish Mary (Alice Greczyn) and they fall in love for each other. During their travel, Ian and Felicia discover that their feelings are more than friendship and that Tasty is not who she told she is.I am still laughing with ""Sex Drive"" since this movie is one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. There are many gross jokes, beautiful tits and girls and enjoyable characters. The cynical Seth Green is simply hilarious in the role of a sympathetic Amish. The scene when Ian is on the stage watching the dancers backstage while a pregnant girl is telling her sad story is so funny that I needed to stop the movie just to laugh. The last scene with Amanda Crew in the end of the credits is also very funny, and I believe many people probably lost this joke. If you are intellectual, or if you do not like this type of movie, please do not spend your time to write bad reviews in IMDb. I can not understand how a viewer can be surprised with the content of a comedy that begins the way ""Sex Drive"" does. Amanda Crew, Katrina Bowden, Alice Greczyn and all the female cast are incredibly gorgeous. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Sex Drive""",Sex Drive
2,kosmasp,Teen Comedy Blueprint,8,2 June 2009,"While ""Napoleon Dynamite"" didn't quite kick-start a new ""era"" of ""geek"" comedies, the teen comedies that do make fun of the sexual tension and discomfort that teens in the early new Millennium feel/have, is quite successful.They're not reinventing the wheel. There were comedies almost like this one a few decades earlier. But the new wave of teen comedies do update the (succesful) ""formula"" very well. Be it ""Superbad"" or as in this case ""Sex Drive"".The story is pretty simple to follow and although you can guess the where it all leads to, even before the movie begins, it is a great fun ride. The actors are very well casted, the jokes keep coming, so you won't even notice the lack of story-tension, that might have occurred to you, if it weren't well paced. Of course some moments are almost over the top gross out, but still the whole movie as it is, is very much in tune with it's characters and the target audience it's after!",Sex Drive
3,jboothmillard,Sex Drive,2,27 December 2012,"I saw the title and rightfully assumed it was a teen based movie about perhaps losing virginity or having lots of sex, and even though it was rated one out of five stars I was up for at least trying it and seeing whether I would disagree with that opinion, directed by Sean Anders (writer of Hot Tub Time Machine and Mr. Popper's Penguins). Basically in Chicago shy and naive eighteen year old high school senior Ian Lafferty (Austin Powers in Goldmember's Josh Zuckerman) is still a virgin, which is easy for his homophobic brother Rex (James Marsden) to mock, but he has best friends Lance (Clark Duke) who although being a little geeky gets all the women, and beautiful Felicia (Amanda Crew) who has been his friend since childhood but he secretly may love. Ian has been chatting to a girl on the internet called Ms Tasty in Knoxville, Tennessee, and he has been lying on the profile to make him look and sound more confident and manly, they have been chatting a while, and he is surprised when she invites him to see her and sounds happy to ""go all the way"". With the opportunity to have sex and lose his virginity he steals his brother's 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge and plans to drive from Brookfield, Illinois to her, Lance is happy to join him to see him achieve his goal, and Felicia comes with them as well, told that they are visiting Ian's sick grandmother. On the journey they encounter many problems and interesting situations, including hitchhikers that turn hostile, state troopers that put them in a cell, and a night of fun on behalf of farmer Ezekiel (Seth Green) with the Amish community called Rumspringa, where they abandon their beliefs and do whatever they like, but more than anything Ian and Felicia are getting closer. They finally reach their destination, where Rex also catches up, but Ian is allowed to see Ms Tasty (Katrina Bowden) by his brother after claiming he may be gay and having sex with the girl may make him straight again, she does turn up and she is beautiful, but then he realises he loves Felicia. So Ms Tasty threatens him to take his clothes off, and then her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo (Dave Sheridan) comes out pointing a gun, and they try to steal Rex's car, and Felicia gets involved in the situation and needs saving, and a small number of earlier characters get involved in the situation, but everything eventually calms down. In the end Lance decides he would prefer the life in the Amish community and to marry beautiful Mary (Alice Greczyn), and Ian and Felicia both realise they love each other and have done for a long time, he loses his virginity with her on New Year's Eve, and Rex comes out as gay after all, we also see the band Fall Out Boy with Ezekiel. Also starring Michael Cudlitz as Rick, Charlie McDermott as Andy and Mark L. Young as Randy. Most of the cast are fine, Zuckerman playing the typical foolish virgin, Duke as an alternative sex pest, Crew being slightly kooky but lovely, and Green as an unusual Amish guy, the story is nothing new, it is essentially another Road Trip, but travelling to have sex and pop the cherry, I agree with the one star out of five rating by critics, it is low on original humour, it was mostly crude and stupid humour, and only the Will They/Won't They? element kept me going, and some kinky stuff, apart from that it is a pointless comedy. Pretty poor!",Sex Drive
4,zardoz-13,Better Than You Might Imagine . . .,8,16 March 2010,"This lightweight, hormone-challenged but entertaining coming of age comedy of about a shy, suburban, 18-year old virgin who desperately wants to give his cherry the boot boasts the usual gross-out gags, genital jokes, and humiliation humor. Every generation gets a movie like this and ""Sex Drive"" is fairly harmless despite its R-rating for some nudity and profanity. Unless you watch the unrated version, the theatrical cut is no where near as raunchy as either ""American Pie"" or ""Porky's."" Nobody gulps semen-flavored drinks a la ""American Pie"" and the equivalent of the ""Porky's"" female shower room scene has upper frontal nudity only. The unrated version contains gratuitous nudity. Actually, ""Sex Drive"" could qualify as a remake of director Rob Reiner's ""The Sure Thing"" with John Cusack. ""The Sure Thing"" was about a character on a road trip to get laid and a platonic girlfriend accompanied him for the trip. Of course, they hated each other in ""The Sure Thing,"" but in ""Sex Drive"" they are such friends that they don't want sex to destroy their friendship.""Never Been Thawed"" director Sean Anders and scenarist John Morris have fashioned a rather funny road trip of errors that contains several surprises. The protagonist is sympathetic as well as likable, and the gallery of characters—both friendly and hostile—is interesting. Anders and Morris resort to the usual profanity, but there isn't that much T & A. One scene shows a group of girls flaunting their breasts backstage. The dialogue is often hilarious. One character tries to guess what a foxy chick has for fur and speculates aloud to our hero: ""There could be a little Hitler or just a full, nasty Chewbacca."" The most surprisingly part of ""Sex Drive"" is the concert that our heroes attend in an Amish community while they are having their car repaired. Ian (Josh Zuckerman of ""Lions for Lambs"") has a wet dream as the film unfolds. He shares his bedroom with his younger brother and is relieved when he realizes that his sibling doesn't know that he has ejaculated in his undies. Ian throws the soggy underwear at the laundry basket, but he misses. Moments later his older brother Rex (James Marsden of ""X-Men"") rags him out and assures him that if he isn't ready in a flash that he cannot ride to work with Rex. No sooner does Rex realize something is wrong than their father and his future wife walk into the bedroom and greet the guys. The younger brother gets up to congratulate his father's fiancé with an embrace, but poor Ian cannot move because he has nothing on from the waist down. Incidentally,Anders and Morris pull a variation of this joke in ""She's Out of My League."" It seems that Ian doesn't have a girlfriend and older, obnoxious, homophobic brother Rex warns him that he will become gay. Complicating matters is that his younger brother dates a girl that Ian works with at a donut shop in the mall.Meanwhile, Ian has been chatting on-line with a gal nicknamed Ms. Tasty (newcomer Katrina Bowden) who lies about being a sexy swimsuit model, while Ian claims to be a football player who benches 300 pounds. Ian's best friend Lance (Clarke Duke of ""Superbad"")encourages Ian to drive to see Ms. Tasty in Knoxville, Tennessee, some nine hours away when she offers to go all the way with him if he will bring his GTO. Ian's only friend who happens to be a girl, Felicia (Amanda Crew of ""John Tucker Must Die"") comes along for the ride and Ian lies that he is going to visit his ailing grandma who is suffering from foot cancer. Along the way, they wind up getting stranded when they think that their car is out of water. Felicia suggests that they urinate into the radiator, but Lance and Ian cannot provide enough liquid to get the car back to running. Felicia finds herself urinating into the car. Predicably, a family of four cruises up and one little boy takes a picture of Felicia that winds up in the Internet on a blog. Half-way to Knoxville, our heroes break down when the GTO blows a gasket, but they luck up and run into an Amish grease monkey Ezekiel (Seth Green of the ""Austin Powers"" movies) who repairs it for no charge. Eventually, Felicia learns what the objective of Ian's mission is. As it turns out, Ms. Tasty has little interest in Ian, but she positively salivates at the car that Ian drives, his older brother's fireball red GTO. She operates a car thief ring and tries to steal Rex's ride. Seth Green is terrific in a supporting role as a sarcastic Amish auto mechanic. James Marsden has a field day blurting out anti-gay dialogue.""Sex Drive"" isn't bad for the initiation saga that it is and everything works out for Ian and Felicia. The James Marsden character takes a 180 degree turn and Lance does what you would least expect of him,too.",Sex Drive
5,george.schmidt,Update on THE SURE THING,6,13 November 2008,"SEX DRIVE (2008) ** Josh Zuckerman, Amanda Crew, Clark Duke, James Marsden, Seth Green, Alice Grezyn, Katrina Bowden, Charlie McDermott, Mark L. Young, David Koechner. Hit-and- miss update of the teen sex comedy that steals liberally from '80s 'classics' like ""The Sure Thing"" and any John Hughes comedy, with Zuckerman (gratingly annoying to the film's detriment) seeking to lose his virginity by taking a road trip down south after his internet 'hottie' invites him to visit. Along for the trip are his best bud, Duke (making the most of the hilarity as an unikely stud) and platonic gal pal (Crew who equally is amiable/sexy) and some outrageous encounters (namely a well-versed Amish auto mechanic played drolly by Green) and Zuckerman's angry, jerk-off older bro Madsen (who displays some impressive comic chops in an homage to Bill Paxton's Chet from ""Weird Science""). Ultimately forgettable but a digressive comedy none-the-less. (Dir: Sean Anders)",Sex Drive
6,neil-476,Smutty but fun,8,14 January 2009,"Sex Drive takes us through fairly familiar territory - loser Ian takes his big brother's car at the instigation of friend Lance to travel across country with the express intention of losing his virginity to online acquaintance Ms Tasty: friend Felicia comes along for the ride.It is quite obvious from the start that Ian and Felicia are meant for each other despite the distractions and obstacles which are thrown at them in this rather episodic road movie crossed with teen sex comedy. And it's all rather good fun, mostly as you would expect, but with occasional welcome surprises along the way. The incident with the dancers in the tent does not proceed as expected, neither does the final meeting with Ms Tasty. And Seth Green's appearance as an unlikely Amish mechanic is a treat.James Marsden is extremely funny as older brother Rex whose prized GTO is taken without permission.The biggest problem I had with this movie, though, concerns Ian's friend Lance. Where Ian is a loser with no success with the opposite sex (where the only problem I could see is that he is a little on the short side), Lance is an incredible success. But Lance's main physical attribute is - how can I put this? - pudginess, and he didn't convince me for a second. Perhaps that, in itself, was a joke but, if so, it;s not one that I got. Perhaps I was simply overwhelmed by the fact that Lance bore an overwhelming resemblance to UK stand-up comedian Alan Carr who is the last person you would expect to see as a Casanova, not least because he is as camp as a row of tents.Josh Zuckerman is an amiable Ian, and Amanda Crew is a very fetching Felicia.",Sex Drive
7,anaconda-40658,Katrina Bowden Worth the Drive.,7,16 December 2015,"Sex Drive (2008): Dir: Sean Anders / Cast: Josh Zuckerman, Amanda Crew, Clark Duke, James Marsden, Katrina Bowden: Raunchy teen comedy about our inner urgings and a long drive Josh Zuckerman embarks upon with his friends, played by Amanda Crew and Clark Duke so that he can lose his virginity to a woman he met via Internet. Great setup establishes his home life and work where he plays mascot for a donut shop. Directed by Sean Anders with great location appeal. Zuckerman holds strong going from insecure to discovering hard facts about his intended dream date. Crew and Duke are well rounded as his accompanying friends. Zuckerman secretly likes Crew but claims to be visiting his sick grandmother when she joins the odyssey. The whole idea of him losing his virginity to her in the conclusion marks a negative message since many unplanned pregnancies occur from just such moments. Duke gets caught up in an Amish community where things aren't as traditional as first thought. James Marsden steals scenes as his overbearing homophobic brother. Katrina Bowden is the beautiful Internet lure that strings Zuckerman along with false hope. A case could be made regarding Internet relationships and the risks involved but that is hardly the ambition of this sex farce. It is at home in its vulgar teen spirit that may drive home to its target viewers. Score: 7 / 10",Sex Drive
8,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Sex Drive,8,6 December 2008,"Despite what I would deem as a glut as far as teenage sex comedies are concerned, it's easy to have seen one to have seen them all, but Sex Drive still managed to arrest some attention from start to end because the screenplay by John Morris and director Sean Anders, based on the book ""All The Way"" by Andy Behrens, has plenty of genuinely funny moments, delivered by an excellent fresh faced cast supported by unlikely veterans hamming it up.Like all road trip related movies, from Harold and Kumar, to Road and Euro Trips, amongst a lot more others, there's always your virginal protagonist who is luckless in getting laid, and the premise has it all set up for him to do so en route to his deflowering destination. And sticking to formula, it dictates that you must have a wise-cracking sidekick who knows all, and/or done it all. If American Pie has its Stifler, then Sex Drive's equivalent would be the unlikely and pudgy Lance (Clark Duke) as his trash-talking mad humping equivalent, goading his best friend virgin Ian (Josh Zukerman) on to make a half-cross country trip to meet the internet girl of his dreams Ms Tasty (mm mmm, Katrina Bowden), who offered to go all the way should he arrive in his (brother's actually) sweet GTO.So on the guise of visiting his ailing grandmother, Ian brings along Lance (who's in on the plan), as well as best female friend Felicia (Amanda Crew) who along the way discovers that this road trip isn't exactly as innocent as it seems. And of course it plays to the usual notion that the one you seek is always forever just by your side and not halfway across the world. It's the same ol' message, but delivered in a totally hilarious package. The strength of the story doesn't like on any marquee name making facial fools of themselves, but having to inject some wonderfully (and sometimes obscene) moments that catch you offguard, sometimes like a frat boy joke, but definitely laugh out loud.As you know with comedies these days, they usually taper off toward the end, or suddenly decide to go all mushy and dramatic. Here, the filmmakers saved the best bits for last, where everything converged together in one madcap finale, and doesn't fizzle out until the very last minute. And that means right up until the very last scene after the end credits roll. Two characters here stand out, and they're not leading roles though. The first would be a very buffed up James Marsden as Ian's brother Rex, who owns the GTO and exploits every opportunity to ridicule his kid brother. The second role, and a scene stealing one at that, belonged to Seth Green's Ezekiel, a sarcastic Amish fella who has the very best lines, and delivered so succinctly, if there was an award for best comedic performance, I'll give it to him in this role, hands down.Political correctness gets thrown out the window, and there are plenty of gaudy jokes involving various body parts. So if this is not your cup of tea, the recommendation would be to skip it as you're likely to frown more often than laugh. Naturally there are some loopholes and continuity errors that were obvious, but don't let those get to you. If you're really up for some good dose of laughing medicine to chase those blues away, then Sex Drive would be that perfect silver bullet.",Sex Drive
9,StevePulaski,On the Road and Looking for Sex,9,4 July 2010,"It gets harder and harder to rate and review Raunchy Comedies nowadays because they seem all the same. Toilet humor, stupid teens, and random sex scenes all in the first twenty minutes. But I hate to say it. ""Sex Drive's"" humor, was funny.I watched the unrated edition of this and was warned by the filmmakers this is basically the ""Chopped and Screwed"" print of the film. There was full frontal women nudity popping up on screen consistently, dubbed lines, and close up extended shots of private parts. It kinda bugged me Netflix didn't have the theatrical cut, but I was able to deal with it.The plot revolves around a shy eighteen year old virgin protagonist named Ian Lafferty (Josh Zuckerman). He is not athletic, fails to impress women, and just a nobody. He turns into an athletic, full of fun and danger, who is a somebody when he talks to his online gal pal dubbed ""Ms. Tasty"" (Katrina Bowden). He acts cool around her, and is hiding his true feelings from his best friend Felicia Alpine (Amanda Crew). When ""Ms. Tasty"" asks Ian if they could meet in Knoxville, Tennessee. He grabs his two closest friends Felicia and Lance (Clark Duke) and head on a trip from Chicago to Knoxville.In their path they find joking Amish men, a dim-witted hitchhiker, a scary old couple, and way more on their quest to meet ""Ms. Tasty"". All the way down their Ian hides his true feelings for Felicia. With them being in Platonic love he fears if his true feelings unleash, a new problem will arise.""Sex Drive"" is like ""The Hangover"". Funny and lively and actually working with one another to make a good movie. When you see movies like ""Band Camp"", ""18 Year Old Virgin"", and ""Strike"", you call them wanna-be comedies. They don't have a good story, they have terrible editing, and no humor at all.Some humor in this was laugh out loud kind. I found some unneeded gay dialogue which felt uncomfortable in place. But for the most part ""Sex Drive"" is a pleasant Comedy, equipped with plenty of laughs, a good story, and an excellent cameo by Seth Green.Starring: Josh Zuckerman, Clark Duke. Amanda Crew, James Marsden, and Seth Green. Directed by: Sean Anders.",Sex Drive
10,MovieAddict2016,"A simple enough diversion, but not very memorable",5,5 April 2009,"Sex Drive looked funny based on commercials I saw, and its early reviews were rather positive, but I was pretty disappointed. It was only marginally entertaining and came across like a really lame Superbad attempt at raunchy teen comedy. There are a few decent cameos (David Koechner is worth mentioning) but as a whole it falls flat, and it's so crude that its sweeter moments feel artificial. I could also go a full lifetime without seeing Clark Duke in a film ever again.There is, however, one saving grace: James Marsden. Channeling all the clichéd ""bad older brother"" roles from '80s teen flicks (my first impression was Bill Paxton from Weird Science), Marsden's psychotically macho performance is deserving of a better film. The unrated cut of the film (which gives Marsden extended scenes of gay jokes) also deserves some credit — to separate it from typical cash-grab Director Cut DVDs, the filmmakers included random shots of porn stars against green scenes and integrated them into the film, just to make it truly different from the theatrical cut. Lots of penises and vaginas dropping out of nowhere. Funny in a gimmicky way, but it wears thin rather quickly, and is ultimately just a greater example of the film's sleazy edge.",Sex Drive
11,thesar-2,Sexless Drive,2,7 February 2009,"I failed to adhere the actually very funny producer/director's warning in front of the ""Unrated"" version of the 'Sex Drive' film. They specifically told us (referring to us as the ""viewers,"" when more appropriately, we're the ""victims"") not to watch this version prior to the ""theater cut"" and that this is strictly for fans of the original movie. (""Fans""? There's more than one?) Well, originally I did listen and watched the first 30 minutes or so of 'Sex Drive' and being thoroughly disappointed in the aimless, predictable (to the final ""climax""), blatant homophobia and unoriginal ideas, I knew I just couldn't watch this twice in a lifetime. So, I started over  before it was too late  with the uncut or unrated or whatever version. It's not hard to see what was added into the unedited version, even without seeing the theater version. Let me start off by saying, female nudity doesn't offend me as male nudity seems to offend a lot of guys. I take both as part of the, well, package of the art of cinema. So, it doesn't offend me to see a naked guy or lady, as long as it enhances the film. I don't use the theater to see naked people (sorry Paul Reubens.) It only bothers me when it's a gimmick, or so called over-the-top joke. The uncut 'Sex Drive' is basically a movie overlapping a soft-porn film (with (mostly) female and some male nudity) and quite frankly, gets old after awhile. Yes, I get the whole ""drinking game"" of taking a shot for every nude person on screen (drunk in 30 minutes or less.) But the device runs thin. Only saving grace was Amanda Crew, Clark Duke and definitively, Seth Green. Their characters were funny enough to raise the movie 1 full star.",Sex Drive
12,bowmanblue,Oddly not as bad as you might think,7,26 August 2014,"Don't get me wrong 'Sex Drive' is no classic, nor will it have you laughing every minute of the (quite long – 1h 44min) runtime. However, 'American Pie' it may not be, but quite reasonable fun it is.It's about your average geeky guy and his attempt at going on a road trip across America with the prospect of well, getting 'friendly' with a young lady. What follows is basically one awkward (and normally sexual) scenario after then next. These pass as a 'story' as they get closer and closer to their overall destination.Yes, it's hardly Shakespeare, but there were a decent enough amount of 'laugh out loud' moments. For me these mainly came from people falling over or hurting themselves (believe it or not I do also like intelligent comedy). I suppose this confirms that 'Sex Drive' is 'low-brow' humour at best. However, if you know what you're getting and are in the mood for an American Pie-like teen comedy which, although doesn't cover any new ground, will at least keep you entertained for a while, then this one is worth a look.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Sex Drive
13,MLDinTN,a movie made for teenage boys,6,15 September 2009,"I would say the target audience for this movie was teen boys. It's another raunchy teen movie sort of like American Pie, but it doesn't have as many crude scenes.Ian, a teen virgin, decides to take his brother's car and go to Knoxville to meet a hot girl he's chatting with online. She says she'll go all the way. So, he starts his adventure with best friends, Lance and Felicia. Of course, things don't go as planned. They end up at an Amish community with car trouble. Ian has problems in a bathroom at a fair. They finally make it to Knoxville, but will Ian go through with it or will Felicia present a problem. Also, does his brother Rex get him for taking his car.I thought it was funny at times. There are some crude scenes like in old guy sitting in the trailer with his ##### hanging out. Seth Green as the Amish guy was the funniest part as he tries to get people to do the chores.FINAL VERDICT: Funny, worth watching.",Sex Drive

Also it seems very similar to Eurotrip, Roadtrip, but it has its differences. I found this to be better than those 2 movies because this film goes into more detail and it is funnier. Although this movie is a little unrealistic and fake. Like why did he go all the way just to meet the girl, and she ended up being real but she was just fooling him. Also the characters were alright but some were annoying. The main character Ian's best friend was beyond annoying and unbelievable. He was always treating his friend bad and he was the one getting the girls-- that was hilarious. The girl was alright, and the older brother was also okay The movie is enjoyable but it can also be boring at times, and some moments are only funny.

18,Sandcooler,"Disappointing ""American Pie""/""Road Trip"" hybrid",4,8 July 2011,"""Sex Drive"" isn't really as much a movie as it is a collage of genre clichés. Everything about this movie gave me a stale, copy-pasted feel, like I had seen it all before in earlier and (slightly) better films. You have the whole road trip theme (as seen in ""Eurotrip"" and dozens of others), but the gang isn't really likable enough to make that angle work. Then there's the hackneyed humor, which revolves mostly around bodily fluids. Granted, there are few things in the world funnier than bodily fluids, but all of it is handled so poorly that you just sit there quietly wondering where you left the remote. The most painful cliché is the whole love story though, damn that sort of thing has been done to death. I get that the movie needed some extra filler in between people getting peed on for vague reasons, but the ""just kiss already!""-factor of this movie is just frighteningly high. Amanda Crew is cute though, that ought to count for something. The rest, I can pretty much do without.",Sex Drive

22,moviesleuth2,Very funny and heartfelt,8,11 March 2010,"People have compared ""Sex Drive"" to ""American Pie,"" and although they are both raunchy sex comedies with a lot of heart, they're really different movies. ""American Pie"" is simply a gross-out comedy (and a very funny one at that). ""Sex Drive"" is a little different; the humor is less broad, and the characters are better developed. Not that this makes the film any less funny. Each scene has a laugh out loud funny moment, and the film is consistently amusing all the way through.Ian (Josh Zuckerman) is a high school senior living in Chicago. And as his older brother Rex (James Marsden) loves to point out, he's still a virgin. However, he meets a gorgeous babe named Ms. Tasty online, and she asks him to come to Nashville for a hot encounter. So, with his best friends Lance (Clark Duke) and Felicia (Amanda Crew), Ian steals his brother's beloved Jaguar and heads off to Nashville.There's some very funny stuff in this movie, such as getting a wet dream at the worst possible moment, or partying with the Amish during Rumspringa, and many other comic moments. Not everything works, but every scene has a laugh-out-loud funny scene.What I really liked is the shifting relationships between the three friends. They all know each other, but since they spend so much time together during this trip, it's obvious that their feelings for each other will be revealed. This creates many interesting, and very real, complications for our three intrepid heroes.The acting is solid, save for one exception. Josh Zuckerman is terrific as Ian. It's a low-key, but effective performance. Complete with voice cracking, Ian is completely real, and immensely likable. Amanda Crew is equally good as Felicia. Felicia has been friends with Ian since they were little, and worries that admitting her feelings about him would ruin their friendship. This kind of thing has been addressed before, but it is handled well in ""Sex Drive,"" and is thus a very real concern. Clark Duke is never believable, however. To be more specific, it's his character that isn't. Duke is fine, but he looks too geeky to be the womanizer. I get that he's supposed to the geeky-looking guy who is surprisingly desirable by girls, I never believed for a second that girls would go crazy over a guy who looks this nerdy.The real surprise is James Marsden. Based on his previous performances, I came to believe that he had zero talent. I was proved wrong however. Marsden is hilarious as the ultra-jock (and ultra-jerk) Rex. Every time he's on-screen I started cracking up.The film covers a lot of material, and it's surprisingly well-paced. Director Sean Anders understands that no pure comedy can last more than 90 minutes without going stale. Anders takes his time developing his characters so that we actually come to care about them. I have to admit that the nude girls that were clearly edited in for the unrated version was a clever concept.""Sex Drive"" is a great movie. At times it's hilarious, but it also allows us to care about these three characters. Highly recommended.",Sex Drive
23,jts0405,Pretty Hilarious Movie,9,4 December 2008,"I mostly thought that all of the great comedies were done for the year after the summer ended. This summer 2008 was truly a great time for comedy with movies such as Step Brothers, Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, etc. My thoughts were changed though when I saw this movie. This was arguably in the same category as those movies. It is easily one of the funniest movies of 2008. It really reminds you of road movies in the late decade such as Road Trip, Euro Trip, etc. and delivers the normal Superbad kind of content. Josh Zuckerman did a really great job in his first starring role that I have seen him in. Seth Green is in this as well and he nearly delivers a ton of laughs in this movie. This is worth it for those who like the usual teen sex kind of comedy.9/10",Sex Drive
24,kirk-246,Where's Judd Apatow when you need him?,7,12 September 2009,"I enjoyed 'Sex Drive'.It's a funny and crude movie that tells the story about a man named Ian who is willing to make a 500 mile journey just to lose his virginity to a girl he met on the internet.Like most movies that involve road trips, not everything goes according to plan.For example, Ian and his friends encounter a mean redneck who catches his daughter making out with one of Ian's friends.Talk about taking the wrong detour.Like I said, I enjoyed 'Sex Drive'.It had it's share of funny moments and I can't say that I regretted watching it.If Judd Apatow, the director of 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', 'Knocked Up', and 'Funny People', directed it, it would've been a smarter and better comedy.Too bad for the people who didn't like this movie.If you're going to watch this, be sure to rent it first before you buy it so you know if it's any good.It's worth watching, but not quite worthy enough to buy on DVD.6.5/10",Sex Drive
25,steiner-sam,It was actually funnier than I expected,6,14 June 2021,"This is set in modern times near Chicago and is a raunchy teenage comedy about a nerdy 18-year-old boy determined to lose his virginity. His adventures on a weekend trip to Tennessee include some Old Order Amish, which is why I watched the film.Ian Lafferty (Josh Zuckerman) is a sincere kid who is bullied by his older brother, Rex (James Marsden), who mocks Ian's sexuality. Ian's best friends are Felicia (Amanda Crew) and Lance (Clark Duke). Ian would like a romantic/sexual relationship with Felicia, but she is interested in Lance. Lance is a confident operator who seems to be able to manage any situation, especially with girls.Ian has developed an Internet relationship with Ms. Tasty, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee. He portrays himself as a major football player with a hot 1969 GTO (that actually belongs to Rex).The movie follows the experiences of Ian, Lance, and Felicia after they steal Rex's car and head to Nashville ""to visit grandma,"" as the guys tell Felicia. There is much crude language related to sex and other bodily functions, combined with flashes of skin along the way mixed with various adventures. One major event unfolds when the car breaks down, and a helpful Old Order Amishman, Ezekiel (Seth Green), offers to help and takes their car back to the Amish community where he has an auto repair and body shop. It appears Ezekiel spent a few years in Rumspringa. While there, they attend a wild Saturday-night rock concert in the community. Lance falls in love with an oversexed Amish girl named Mary (Alice Graczyn).When they finally reach Nashville, they discover Ms. Tasty (Katrina Bowden) is not what she seemed on the Internet, and everyone ends up in jail overnight until bailed out by Mary, the Amish girl. Everything resolves properly at the end.""Sex Drive"" is R-rated for a reason -- mostly vulgar language and some sexuality. It was actually funnier than I expected. I imagine 16-year-old boys in 2008 loved it. One feels a bit like a teenager watching it.The Amish portrayals, of course, have no connection to reality. There are buggies and plain clothes, but Mary's hair spills down to her waist. There are references to Rumspringa and shunning, but that's about the extent of cultural acknowledgment.",Sex Drive
26,dvc5159,A well-crafted sex comedy.,5,2 March 2009,"Granted, it's not original, as the plot can be reminiscent of ""Road Trip"". But then again, originality is not the issue here (or anymore for that matter). It's all in the execution, and for that I have writer-director Sean Anders to thank, for he steers the film away from many, many clichés.The actors do a good part here. Not cheesy and not too dumb, and very like-able at the same time. Zuckerman as the lead hero virgin who discovers that, along the way, sex isn't everything. Amanda Crew as his best friend. Clark Duke as the sex-crazed other best friend. The trio's chemistry is great. Notable mention goes out to Seth Green as a sarcastic Amish, and especially James Marsden, who went from buff superhero Cyclops to hilarious, dumb-ass older brother. Marsden stole the show here.The writers knew what they were going for here. Sex Drive, a drive to have sex. So they filled in as many a clever joke and reference as possible. While not original, the film still stands out as one of the better comedies of 2008, and not as repetitive and crude as the DTV American Pie movies. Most of the jokes hit the right parts, especially near the end of the film. Not to mention some nice scenery (hey, it's a road trip movie after all).So, if you are few on laughs, and/or already seen ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Role Models"", give ""Sex Drive"" a try. You won't be disappointed.Overall: 7/10",Sex Drive
27,Greatornot,Not a Good Teen Movie,3,2 September 2009,"This movie was severely lacking. The best characters in the film were Rex and Sean Green as the Amish guy. The other characters including the 3 headliners were awful. No energy and not much in the way of acting ability. The movie was filled with stupid one liners, homophobic material and quite frankly too many tasteless Amish references. It was of course a predictable plot with some awful slapstick moments. I get the title SEX DRIVE.... The protagonist was driving many miles for sex. That was clever, but hanging your hat on the title of a movie is very sad. Most of the creative value into the title and not much elsewhere. I was ready to give this movie about a 1 , than there were actually some nice twists toward the end of the film, before going back to predictable. This was a film that was clearly very low budget with the hope of bringing in the 'niche' that watches these silly type movies. Probably smart of the writers to keep this at a bare minimum with many bare ladies in the film. I am going to go out on a limb and predict no academy award nominations for this movie. Consider yourself cautioned!",Sex Drive
28,tburke85,Sex Drive A Surprisingly Funny Comedy,7,19 May 2009,"When I started watching Sex Drive I wasn't expecting much but it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Sex Drive is no film for parents to take their kids to see but it's a funny coming of age story about one mans quest to lose his virginity. The talented cast of relatively unknowns including Josh Zuckerman as Ian the guy on the quest, Amanda Crew as the sexy Felicia who's Ian's best friend (and *spoiler* soul mate), and Clark Duke as their friend Lance the ladies man. Seth Green is perfectly cast as Ezekiel an Amish man who parties and fixes cars for free. The same can go for James Marsden as Ian's brother Rex who's great at playing a likable jerk with a hilarious secret. Both actors bring a lot to their small roles and provide some of the comic relief. Mostly everything in this film worked but adults should be warned that Sex Drive contains strong sexual content, nudity and vulgar language. But if you're a fan of comedies or the American Pie series than chances are you'll enjoy Sex Drive too.",Sex Drive

His older brother Rex is a homophobic jerk who teases his brother for being gay, even though he isn't he is just simply a virgin. Even Ian's younger 14 year old brother is getting lucky with the girls. So when his young brother goes away to race motocross and takes the family with him he and his two best friends steal Rex's cherry 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge and drive from Chicago all the way to Knoxville, Tennessee to meet his beautiful internet girlfriend. Sounds simple enough...but the adventure they have on the way is one of the funniest I have ever witnessed.This movie is hilarious, I was laughing five minutes into it and had a good laugh every other minute..many were laugh out loud hysterical. I loved the crazy characters and all the wild stuff these kids got into, I wish more films were made like this...I have only seen the unrated version and it was pretty raunchy at times.Josh Zuckerman, James Marsden, Seth Green, Mark L.

Also you can hear great songs by bands like AC/DC, MGMT and The Flys - Fall Out Boy actually play live on the film, I wish they could have found someone better for that Amish party.I almost gave this movie a perfect 10 rating, because it is that good and I can't wait to show it to every one I know...9/10 stars ....if you want real crazy comedy with hot girls, kinky sex, fast cars, randy Amish, old man testicles, hold-ups and so much more then here you go...I loved it!",Sex Drive

It ranks right up their with my favorite movies. It was very stupid and had tons of crude humor. It was all done it good taste though. The movie in ways kind of shows you to be yourself but at the same time adventures and fun. You can still be a good kid and be risky and take chances. The actors in the movie did a pretty good job. Considering all of the actors are out of their teens and had to play teenagers in the movie. They did a pretty good job for the most part. the whole movie has you laughing and nearly falling out of your seat. It started out very funny and kept getting funnier till the very end. It was in ways romantic. The movie doesn't give away anything the whole time. The movie ends well on all levels. It had many different thing in the movie from Amish people to sexy dancers to jail fights. The movie was very immature and had many adult themes. I think that this movie is good for teenagers and some adults who like sexy teen comedies. It was funny and very entertaining the whole time. Go see the movie you will not be disappointed. Im glad I went to see this sneak preview. Overall a very humorous movie with many laughs.,Sex Drive

The characters are sort of developed a bit more and the relationships among them, for example, Felicia and Ian. The only problem with this movie is that it seems that we've seen this movie a thousand times already: Eurotrip, American Pie, Superbad, and now, Miss March, we've been through them already.

Follow a bunch of sight-gags revolving around penises, breasts, flatulence, the Ahmish and James Marsden's over the top homophobic big brother to Ian.Ian, his pal Lance and Ian's beloved Felicia hitch Rex's (James Marsden) GTO to head to Knoxville. Along the way they encounter the movie's sole saving grace in Seth Green, who gets some genuine chuckles as the sarcasm-addicted Ahmish car repairman who saves the day for the group. The movie is quite uneven, however, going from a buddy movie to exploring teen longing to unnecessary gross out humour, leaving its message (Tell your crush that you love them and go from there) behind in some forced scenes. Hard to give this movie more than an average rating as the messages of friendship and longing have been explored much better in other movies. The cast isn't exactly crowd-friendly either. Zuckerman does fine as the overwhelmed teen but Clark Duke as Lance is as unlikeable as you can get in a precocious teen. Amanda Crew (along with most women in the movie) is a decoration, adding to the misogynistic overlay of the film.See only if in the same age group or if nothing else is on.",Sex Drive

40,ThreeThumbsUp,A little over the top,5,4 December 2010,"Over-the-top raunchiness and complete lack of realism don't usually make for a convincing cinematic mix.Unfortunately, Sex Drive has both.The biggest issue I have with this film is the fact that the balding, pudgy kid with glasses named Lance has zero trouble attracting women while the slim, normal-looking character named Ian can't even look at a female without awkwardly fumbling his words. We aren't asking for 100 percent realism here, and I'm not saying every overweight, non-athlete is completely hopeless, but this off-kilter aspect of the movie really sours the whole thing for me.The only feature that saves Sex Drive from completely tanking is that it's consistently funny (and Amanda Crew -- she's beautiful). Yes, the jokes are crude and could be considered offensive to many viewers, but I've seen worse. The R rating is earned quite easily.I'll attempt to divulge the most fundamental plot synopsis without giving too much away: Ian is a frustrated 18-year-old virgin. Apparently incapable of talking to girls in person, he begins flirting with a hot blonde on the Internet and eventually sets up a date with her in Tennessee after lying about his looks, hobbies and athletic prowess.After stealing his brother's tricked-out 1969 GTO, Ian grabs his playboy friend Lance and girl-pal Felecia and sets out for the nine-hour trip from outside Chicago to Nashville.The obvious debauchery ensues along the way as the core plot begins to emerge. The stunning Felecia admits to Ian that she has a crush on the chubby, weird-looking Lance (go figure), which at first has little impact on Ian, until he begins to have feelings for Felecia.The rest is just details",Sex Drive

47,marais-alexander,"A guilty, no - very guilty - and gross pleasure",4,24 September 2013,"MIGHT CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS All in all, this film has got to be one of the poorest, most disgusting, and derivative movies I've seen in a long time. My roommate was a fan of it and so I tagged along in watching it. It felt like a teenage version of Knocked Up, except less intelligent and way more graphic. Then again I was watching the unrated cut. It's very objectifying of females, but that's to be expected in a dude comedy. The main character, Ian, is delightfully dorky and out of touch with how to be cool. James Marsden (an unrecognizable James Marsden) is actually excellent as homophobic Rex, I'm not used to seeing him play non-straightlaced roles, which he is so good at (The Notebook, Straw Dogs). Wendy Crew from The Haunting In Connecticut gives a sweet and unassuming performance as Felicia, who tags along the Ms. Tastay road trip. But the excessive nudity (including a horrible scene involving a public ejaculation at a trauma conference) and disturbingly raunchy sex humor kills the movie's potential. The performances could be funny if the material was subtler, and had more depth. There are mere moments of potentially good filmmaking here, but they are squashed by - as Sean Anders or whoever said in the commentary - ""more tits!"" 4/10, a real failure but so bad it's kind of good.",Sex Drive

One day, the girl offers him sex, but Ian has to drive all the way to Knoxville to meet the girl. Desperate meeting the girl, Ian takes his brother Rex's (James Marsden) car without permission and is off to Knoxville with two of his close friends Lance (Clark Duke) and Felicia (Amanda Crew).The story is very simple and easy to follow, but there is a good twist at the end that might surprised you a bit. The jokes are hilarious and different from other comedy films. I think you will not be disappointed at all.The performances were solid and the cameos by Seth Green were incredibly funny. Josh Zuckerman really did a good job as Ian. I was surprised on how hilarious James Marsden is in the movie. He is so mean to his brother in the film, but in a funny way. I thought he pull it off perfectly. The rest of the cast did well also, including Amanda Crew and Clark Duke.Sex Drive was one of the funniest films of 2008 and now one of my favorites.

53,Spacetree,Pretty Hilarious,7,30 September 2008,"I saw Sex Drive at a sneak preview presented by my university. It's a seemingly typical teen sex comedy in the vein of Superbad meets Road Trip. Zuckerman plays Ian, a young virgin with no luck with the ladies, a crush on his childhood friend Felicia (Crew), a jerk of an older brother (Marsden), and is best friends with an Austin Powers-esquire Casanova by the name of Lance (Duke). On the internet, he poses as a football player while courting a mysterious girl online. When the girl invites him to go ""all the way"", he steals his brother's GTO and heads to Knoxville with Felicia and Lance. Ian's character has the usual nerdy teen virgin-in-a-movie problems: falls for the wrong girls, takes few risks, gets caught in embarrassing sexual situations. On the road trip, they run into a series of hilarious, awkward, and weird situations. And on the way, they discover that sex isn't the most important thing, and that true love can be found in both odd and familiar places.It's not exactly stunningly original, but it's still a hilarious film. The three leads do a pretty good job, Lance being a particularly funny character. Marsden and Green steal the show in all the scenes they're in, and all of the characters in the film are interesting, even if most of them are stock characters. The script is also well-connected, with most of the characters being connected to the larger plot, and combines wit, ribaldry, and straight adult humor well. Every gag sequence gets big laughs, and the comedy never slows down or dies out. The internet cut-aways are especially hilarious supplements.It's refreshing to see a genuinely adult comedy not coming from the Apatow crew or McKay and Ferrell. Although it lacks star leads and filmmakers and will probably drop under the radar, I definitely recommend Sex Drive to anyone looking for a big laughs.",Sex Drive

I think it's mostly because of the lack of ""name"" actors and also because teenage comedies reached a point of overload.

Yes, it was charming, and equally hilarious. Sure, the Donut costume made me laugh my arse off, there was only one thing that kept me from leaving at the end filled with disappointment, and that is Seth green. I gotta say, i haven't seen him much but he sure is hilarious, and the Amish character just made me respect him a lot more for his comedic genius!!! zuckerman was cool, Clark duke was deserves an honorable recognition, and Crew just looked sensational!!! Of course, being a guy, i feel the scene at the stage when the dancers were changing was spectacular!! All in all, if you are between the ages of 13-30, and like sex comedies without the raunch, and heart stepping in, u will like this movie. if not, go save your money and wait for the rental, or go to the matinée show to save money like i did.",Sex Drive
57,misterlei,a memorable teen movie,9,23 February 2010,"I don't usually like teen movies or road movies, but the two are combined in this. I would not normally give a movie like this a second glance, but right from the start it is very funny, and the puerile, slapstick and excruciating humour immediately roped me in. The movie has a sense of post-irony in the way it makes a point about the representation on film of gratuitous nudity, and the different points in the movie when the action suddenly widens to involve the production crew and even spontaneous unscripted moments by the cast.This movie is more subversive of the genre than it lets on, and for that reason i think it is very clever. The script and the characterisation is so realistic; i particularly liked the character of Ian's raucous brother Rex, and his genuine excitement at receiving a juicer at Christmas an excellent masterstroke and a witty comment on the gay lifestyle.Fabulous. An unexpected treat.",Sex Drive
58,hitechcleaning5,Fresh take on an enduring story.,8,12 April 2009,"In spite of being a few generations apart from the cast members, I related to this film because it's an enduring story that is re-told by every generation. In this instance, the comedy is without peer and the thesis is valid and fun. The computer jargon and tech references supersede the passing of notes, serenades, and ""private"" phone conversations, and the buzz words (twatblocking, etc) are new but the story remains the same. A teen boy wants sex. He uses every ruse he can contrive to ""get it on""with someone, ANYONE! His continuous failure creates self doubt and he fails to realize that his BFF is the answer. The girl really cares for him but does not know how to make him aware of her feelings and has concerns that intimacy might undermine their friendship. Nevertheless, she puts her self out there, hoping for the best.The vitality of the film springs from the energy of the actors. The conflicts within the sub- plots, the references to cross culturing between young and older, white middle class and Amish, rural folks v. big city people, and morality over immoral behavior create viable messages and themes that maintain the dynamics while spelling out traditional values, acceptance and ""coming of age"".This was a totally enjoyable movie experience for me and reflects great credit on the actors, the writers, the production staff and the director. I give this film high marks. It is one of the best blends of comedy and real life I have seen in some time.",Sex Drive

He tells her he has a 1969 GTO (his brother's) and she says if he drives to see her in Knoxville, she'll make it worth his while. The plot sounds normal for a raunchy teen comedy, but it's pulled off hysterically. It probably couldn't have without the perfect cast.The main character, Ian, is played perfectly to the part of the lovable virgin everyone will be rooting for. Clark Duke is perfect as the suave ladies man in a dork's body and Amanda Crew is perfect for the best-friend-who-wants-more. But the best performances are by Seth Green and James Marsden Seth Green, playing a sarcastic Amish man, will make you laugh every single time he says ""I'm just f*cking with you."" He plays it so well, you'll want to become Amish. And then there's James Marsden. You've probably seen him play a superhero, a lovable dance show host, an innocently narcissistic prince, and a cynic we all grew to love. Ever seen him play a cocksure older brother with a maniacal laugh? This shows a whole different side to him; the crude, crass, cussing, cocksure homophobic side.

He ventures online to find a girl to finally lose his virginity to, which takes him half way across the nation with his two friends. They run into a series of events that slow them down towards the meeting which actually add a lot of comedy into the movie. It is very predictable in the sense that he will fall in love with his friend, but there are many other twists and turns that you do not see coming. The movie overall to me is a solid seven and I would definitely watch it again!",Sex Drive

For a comedy of its type, and all of you know what I mean by this coming of age sort of comedy, it had a lot of slow parts that weren't funny, and needless sentimentality that only served to slow the movie down. However, when it was funny, it was super funny.The ongoing gags were pretty notable, and performances were top notch, notably by Seth Green as the sarcastic Amish guy. This may reign as best sarcastic performance in any movie, ever. The energy between the various performers was right and helped execute most of the gags effectively. As I mentioned, I have complaints, but they are trivial. If you want some goofy humor to eat popcorn to, give it a shot.",Sex Drive

You begin to feel for Ian but also care for Felicia and Lance. The side characters are also quite amusing and help make the laughs and balance out the plot. His bullying brother was great, loved Seth Green in it and the vengeful boyfriend.Overall its pretty funny and actually got a nice sentiment behind the story, not just another sex film but there's these things called feelings involved (Yes I had to check the dictionary for feelings, they apparently are quite normal to have them) which make the story quite engaging.Would definitely watch again.",Sex Drive

So they make a journey across the country to make it happen. That's pretty much the premise. A lot of stuff happens in between, which is what makes it fun, but its the standard dirty movie premise.Roadtrip in that its a fun journey across the country. Superbad in that the premise is there...friend wants to help a friend get laid. The Girl Next Door in that the previews make it look like a dirty sexual comedy but ends up being a comedic feel-good, get the right girl movie.Don't get me wrong, I laughed a lot during Sex Drive, but I got the same exact vibe as I got from The Girl Next Door (mind you I also rated that a 7/10). It comes off as this ridiculously ""wrong"" movie, but for the most part it is a tame comedy with a lot of dirty jokes sprinkled in. Sure, I wouldn't bring kids to this movie, but at the same time I'm not going to sit here and say I laughed as hard as I did at Superbad the first time around.Is it a good movie? Sure, but probably worth waiting until it comes out on DVD. Superbad had nonstop comedy. I literally missed a lot of the spoken lines because I couldn't stop laughing. But with Sex Drive, on the other hand, I had time to catch all the lines...and there certainly were breaks between good dirty jokes.Best comedy of 2008? Probably not. I'd reserve that distinction maybe to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Good comedy worth seeing at some point? Certainly.On another note, like Superbad, there really aren't any good quotes from Sex Drive to recite to your friends...that unless you really want to go out of your way and memorize Seth Green's unexpected, and comical lines.",Sex Drive
65,rustyalex2,How far would you go to go all the way? .... Not that far!,5,12 April 2009,"Sex Drive falls short from being its own film. By this I mean, that it's trying too hard to be like films such as American Pie, Euro Trip and Superbad. The things that make the other films unique are the simplicity of the storyline and plot. Sex Drive seems to take bits and pieces from other films and sticks it into their own. Having a character like Rex, resembles the original Stifler character, therefore Sex Drive reminds you of a dull and copycat version of American Pie which sadly fails to live up to any of the classics.The film has a storyline which has already been used a million times before, however teenagers will continue to see these films regardless of the story, as with all teenage films; sex has to be involved in it somehow.Its the story of an 18 year old guy called Ian who meets a girl on the internet, he then takes his best friends Lance and Felicia with him on his journey from Chicago to Knoxville to meet her. Along the way they encounter many situations similar to that of Road Trip.The film was an average comedy, not as good as American Pie, Superbad or the classics such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. The acting wasn't so good and many times the conflicts were ridiculously hilarious and the 'love' moments were very cheesy.As a whole, the film had some 'original' moments which were good to see, but the constant borrowing from other films, made Sex Drive fail to be its own film as mentioned before. Well if your a horny teenager who is still a virgin or if you remember when you were younger that you were obsessed with sex and never got laid until you were 18, then by all means see this film.",Sex Drive

Those scenes were vulgar and makes you think that this movie was supposed to be comedy and made us laugh.. right? i mean what was the need of bringing undressed girls on screen with no reason what so ever. but yes there were few scenes which are hilarious in the movie. i liked the role of James Marsden in the movie.. and his biggest secret revealed in the end. This movie kind of reminded me of euro trip and road trip as the plot was somewhat same. The movie has a really short and simple story but It again shows that how a journey could give you lots of experience and make your movie even bigger.

67,bradlewis98,Totally unwatchable,1,21 July 2009,"I am not going to say this movie is terrible or brilliant. Clearly its not very great. This kind of stuff is always pretty incompetent (I have a MA in film--I can't not keep an eye on form), but usually pretty funny. Aggressively stupid coming of age type stuff works on me far more than it doesn't. You don't need to be Godard to make something like Super Troopers or Valley Girl or Road trip or Nick and Norah or whatever work. Nostalgia plus easy to please means cheap teenage comedies get to me far too often. But this? Sex Drive isn't a movie, it's an abortion. The basic joke structure is obnoxious+boob. So essentially its 2 hours of listening to someone you would punch in real life and punchline flashes of full frontal nudity. These movies depend on three things: characters, gags, and soundtrack. All awful here. Mostly bland characters, no real jokes to speak of, and massively unmemorable attempts to pin the movie to a time. Then Fall Out Boy shows up. Unwatchable movie plus one of the most unlistenable bands I can think of. Awesome. But hey, bright spot: Seth Green. Dude shows up, acts all Seth Green-y, and brings the only funny of the movie. At the end of the day this movie exists, in one form or another, over and over again. A version of Sex Drive is released like 5 times a year. Just watch the other 4, this thing is a bloody disaster. Humor is 100% subjective (proof? Carlos Mencia gets work) and I can dig that. I'm not taste cop, groove on what you want. But seriously, you can do better.",Sex Drive

69,stef_nijssen,"Ezekiel Is Hilarious, I Love His Sarcasm.",6,23 October 2008,"Since this film was a comedy let's look at it in that light first. I saw this movie about a week ago and it had about two hilarious moments which I am having a hard time remembering. The rest of the film most of the audience sat there in silence, with sporadic giggles throughout. My friends whom I watched the pre-screening with said they were amused in general but didn't find the film very funny. This is probably because this film strongly uses clichés and old ideas that have just been reshuffled with relatively little originality.The originality is this: The two main characters (the lead and his goofy friend) are in some sort of role reversal where their bodies and personalities are flipped and it's very hard to believe either can be themselves the way they are. The whole film I felt this way and and it was quite distracting, this may to some degree be attributed to the actors and Director failing to create believability and instead creating teen-comedy caricatures, but to the actors credit the three leads showed promise and could do better in a different movie.The comedy itself has a lot of preteen raunchiness that appears so often and so strongly that if you were to see a naked old man showing his gonads like in the movie ""Borat"" you wouldn't be very shocked or surprised. Normally this would be funny, like in the scene in ""American Pie"" with the the pie; but since this film holds very little meaning below the obvious surface gags, the comedy punch doesn't land strongly if at all that often.This film was also full of young beautiful actresses meant to portray the regular public as they cameo over and over again through most scenes. I don't recall one average looking young woman in the whole movie. This was slightly annoying because perhaps I was looking for something like ""Dazed and Confused"" and felt like was I was watching something a little better than ""American Pie 3"". What I mean is that this film is like ""Superbad"" where it's laden with raunchy teen comedy and some teen sexual angst. But unlike ""Superbad"" it doesn't have the deep underlying truths that elevate the script above boorish crude gags. If it weren't for those two hilarious scenes I failed to describe and perhaps the saving grace of the lead actors this film would be garbage. But it's not, and kudos to the Donut costume! If you are between the ages of 13-19 you'll probably like this film a bunch. Everybody else prepare to be mostly silently amused.6/10",Sex Drive
70,campkllyrsf-1,"This decade's ""Road Trip""",7,12 October 2008,"So there was a screening of Sex Drive at the theatre, so I thought ""what the hell?""From the preview, I thought it could have gone one of three ways: 1. A horrible attempt at an R-rated comedy in the same fashion of a pretty good comedy a decade ago. (Like College tried for American Pie, and failed) 2. A mediocre R-rated comedy with bits here and there. 3. A movie that knows what it's going for and hits its mark. I would have to say, this movie is very close to #3. The movie isn't a great movie, but it has no delusions on what it is. With the plot of a guy driving cross state just to get some ass, there's not a lot of directions you can go with it. The makers know this, so they make the best of it. No real need to stress much on the story. It's simple, basic, predictable. Bad? I wouldn't say that. The story is really more of a momentum pusher than anything. It's really only there to prevent this from being a series of jokes and gags just jumbled together. There's no real big twist, a few lessons to be taken form it, but they all have been done before. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen at the end within the first 15 minutes. But the story isn't really the important thing here, so no real points taken off for that.All the actors are good. Clichéd, yes, but they are likable. The goofy, virgin lead guy who's trying to get some tail is played wonderfully by Josh Zuckerman. Pulls it off flawlessly with all the awkwardness and uncertainty that the character would have. Amanda Crew is also really good at the ""BFF"" of Josh's character. The two have pretty good chemistry, even with all their awkwardly close moments. It isn't perfect, but being in some of those awkward situations, they were (while pushed a bit) familiar.A surprise is James Marsden. You may remember him as Cyclops from X-Men, and he pulls off a great punk-ass older brother with a sense of humor of his own. He is the typical ass hole older brother in these kind of movies, but he pulls it over very well. Seth Green just seems like he's cruising through the movie. I think he's got a lot of talent and I knew even if the movie was going to be bad, he would provide a good set of laughs. And as a sarcastic Amish engineer genius, he's just fits in this movie seamlessly. But I have to give a lot of credit to Clark Duke. His first real movie. He was a party extra in Superbad, if I'm not mistaken, the one who called McLovin' a bad ass. Like Seth Green, he just seems to glide through. He also has great chemistry with Josh Zuckerman. You can tell the two of them just had a really good time together on this. He is the suave ladies man who's guiding his pathetic best friend on his verge of losing his virginity, while getting some action himself. He doesn't have the look of the typical character, but he pulls it off excellently. I put a lot of emphasis on the characters and actors. They were the backbone of the movie. Not the story, but the characters. There's also a hand full of supporting characters that do a good job at their parts, and an unwelcome (well, for me it was unwelcome) appearance by Fall Out Boy. There are few things worse than a comedy that's not funny. There have been a serious excess of those as well. Dane Cook just had a movie a few weeks ago, and that was a haggard piece of crap. I actually have to say though, I laughed quite a bit in this movie. With the plot, there are going to be quite a few of the sex jokes, involving spooge, penises and homosexuality. Most of them though actually delivered. I can't actually say there were too many flat moments with the jokes. Yes, there were some, but the jokes that worked out-weighed those that didn't. The climax got really over-the-top, but it did continue on with the laughs, and was satisfying. The closure did take a bit longer than necessary, but didn't drag. The movie was actually well paced and I was never bored. This is no Superbad. It's not anywhere in that league. I walked out of this movie saying ""This is 2000's Road Trip."" No, Road Trip wasn't a masterpiece or one of those comedy powerhouses, but it was really good for what it was going for. An over-the-top, R-rated comedy. See it with a group of friends in the theatre. Definitely see it with a crowd, it will probably make it that much more enjoyable. 3.75/5Also, if you saw the trailer and had no interest, then you probably would want to skip it.

I had standard vibes you'd get from a teen comedy and then it's taken up another notch. The unrated version is also something to watch because there's more jokes within jokes and even more boobs. I would suggest you to watch this flick if you're hanging out with some friends drink some beers and want to laugh and not really think about the content. It's funny to see the movie world they live in and how hard and amazing it is when you get things like beer. It's a nice escape to what many would term as ""the salad days"" of teenage boobs, underage drinking, drugs, and trying to get laid.

It's not a bad movie by any means, but by the end I was simply thinking to myself, that its all been done before and crafted a lot better in the past.The 'moral dilemma' of the film takes up and unreasonable amount of time throughout the movie and this means that other characters take a backseat.

76,lynn-ash,Tripping Out - *spoilers*,10,2 May 2011,"""Sex Drive"" is a coming-of-age-self-discovery film which is also a comedy. Ian, the main character, a young man of 18, feels the urge to lose his virginity, but not at home - this hasn't worked. He's never hooked up with a girl, despite his unrequited love for Felicia.Felicia's true feelings are masked: does she feel love for Lance, or does she secretly love Ian? The third major character, Lance, while seemingly content with himself and attractive to women, (why? I have no idea - he does nothing for me...) also has to come of age. He needs to find steady commitment, and not just jump from girl to girl. These three need to travel in order to fulfill themselves. The fourth major character is Rex. Too old to be living at home and going on motocrosses with his baby brother, he takes out his unspoken frustrations on his younger brother, Ian, challenging his sexuality by teasing him and calling him names. There are several catalysts in this story. For Ian, his is the girl he's been writing to on the internet, a certain ""Miss Tasty"". When he reaches his destination, he discovers that she's not genuine but menacing. He also gives up some of his predictability when he throws his shoes onto the ""shoe tree."" Felicia cannot reveal her true feelings until she is trapped in Ian's situation and has to be rescued by him. She will later help him ""visit Grandma.""Lance meets Mary, a girl different from the bimbos he's been associating with (excluding Felicia: she's no bimbo and she's off limits). Mary is Lance's catalyst. Another catalyst is Ezekiel, the Amish auto mechanic posing as a farmer, strictly local and unsophisticated, untraveled and inexperienced dairyman. He provides relief for Ian's mechanical troubles and is a calming influence. Rex discovers that his brother is more daring than he suspected. He discovers his car missing, and goes after Ian and The Judge with a vengeance, after having a destructive temper tantrum. Another catalyst is the redneck boyfriend of Brandy (a girl of indeterminate virtue who works at a truck stop and accepts random acts of kindness and sex).Many of the characters come together at a Big Boy parking lot in Knoxville, Tennessee. Ian becomes a hero,the redneck shows his friendly side, and Lance gets a deserved punch in the jaw, and Rex also gets his comeuppance by Miss Tasty's boyfriend and insight into Ian's bravery and chivalry. Rex doesn't show all of his true colors and secret until Thanksgiving, after which time Ian and Felicia ""visit Grandma"". Despite his ""true confession,"" Rex has not forgotten his teasing nature, and seems to have developed a talent for lighting and throwing firecrackers at an inopportune time. Well acted by all the cast, and a genuinely funny script. Despite all the comparisons to other movies of the genre, it stands on its own and does not take itself at all seriously. It would be a mistake for anyone to do that. The two most comedic actors are Seth Green and James Marsden. Marsden is barely recognizable in bleached hair and a mustache and goatee. Anyone who tries to typecast him would be foolish; he will try anything and has no fear of making himself look and act ridiculous, doing it brilliantly. Green almost plays himself, but does it well. The rest of the cast are believable and likable. I cannot ask any more than that from an actor in a comedy: help me believe in you and like you, and use your comedic timing and ability. Then we'll all laugh and enjoy it. This happened in ""Sex Drive,"" which probably scandalized many folks. If I were a young man, I could imagine identifying with all these characters.",Sex Drive

This could have been a very well done, very funny movie but it falls down so often it becomes hard to watch. Where has our society failed that anyone could think a record setting full screen 2 minute shot of an old mans scrotum is funny. This movie thinks golden showers and brown showers are humorous.

The main character, Ian, is an absolute rip off of Jim from American Pie, but without the heart or empathy that Jim garnered.2. He's older brother and best friend are both part Stifflers. The older brother plays the jerk who makes gay references the entire time, while he's best friend plays the objectifying and womanizing lothario. Unfortunately, you actually liked Stiffler though. Of course you did. We all know who Sean William Scott is now. If nobody had heard of X-men then James Marsden would have just killed he's career even more so.3. The best friend, the womanizer, is played by a fat dorky guy named Clark Duke. Makes sense. Women are falling over themselves to sleep with the fat dorky guy. But wait, he's referred to as cool in the movie! Why? Nobody knows. He never does anything except say 'chill out' or some crap that makes him irresistible to women. Upon watching the movie I wondered why I recognized this guy and then I remembered the superbad DVD commentary. They mention Clark Duke cause he kept jumping into every scene in the house party ruining continuity. I also remember when I watched it thinking 'who is that fat dorky looking emo in nearly every shot'. Congratulations Clark Duke. You can tell your grandkids you were in a funny movie. Yeah, the one where you never say any lines and try to ruin it! 4. This movie is completely summarized in one quote by Clark Duke near the end of the film when he turns to the camera and says 'These things never happen in real life'.This sums up this movie entirely. Everything in this movie NEVER happens in real life. It's absurd, ludicrous and downright stupid.Let me just give you one, and one example alone, of the stupidity of this movie.The movie is about a virgin who drives across the country to finally have sex with a hot blonde girl who will screw him...BUT...10 minutes into the movie he crawls away from a hot blonde girl who is practically trying to rape him on a bed cause he's friend asks where he is......???? WTF If you had a choice between anaesthesia-free amputation of your balls and watching a movie that insults your intelligence like Sex Drive does, I definitely recommend becoming the eunich soprano for your local church choir.",Sex Drive

82,benebene,Sweet little movie about love?,5,28 February 2009,"As one would not expect ""Sex Drive"" is more about love than it is about sex. Ian, a young high-school graduate from the suburbs of Chicago is not happy with his life because he has finished high school and still did not get laid yet. This is about to get changed when he meets ""Miss Tasty"" on the Internet whom he tells all sorts of lies just to impress. Seemingly, ""Miss Tasty"", who lives a 9 hour drive away from Ian becomes so impressed with Ian that she wants to meet him and help him loose his virginity. So Ian borrows his brothers car and grabs his two best friends who will join him on his journey to become a man. Unfortunately, Ian is in love with one of his friends.The movie develops into a nice little road-movie that reminds in some ways to ""Road Trip"". ""Sex Drive"" also reminds a little bit of American Pie, if you consider the humor and one of the characters in this movie. Rex, Ian's older homophobic and extremely male brother, resembles Stifler in quite a few ways: he looks similar, his laughter is highly similar, his high-pitched voice when he becomes excited is similar, and even the names he calls people are similar (i.e. ""shit-stick"", ""fag-bag"").This movie reminds me too much of other movies that I have seen before which is why I only gave it 5 stars. Additionally, the fecal matter humor ""Sex Drive"" touches upon over and over is lame and overdone (there is too much pooping, farting and pissing that probably a 12 year old can really laugh hard about). ""Sex Drive"" is also trying to be funny by showing lots of nakedness which is as such is not funny at all. I mean come on, if I really wanted to see naked people, I would not turn to ""Sex Drive"". Although, what I really thought was at least a little funny was that I recognized Angelina Valentine among naked girls who were standing in front of a truck stop.At the end the movie really gets a cheesy turn when it all of a sudden becomes wanna-be educational and tells the moral to the story, which goes like this: ""If you hold out for the one you love, you are one the good guys. And if you chase after girls trying to get them in bed, well, then you're the bad guy.""So in conclusion, I guess you shouldn't obey your ""Sex Drive"".",Sex Drive
83,stijn-vanpoelvoorde,another stupid but hilarious road trip :-),7,25 January 2012,"the plot is simple , not really worth mentioning , but it's a comedy and a good one . It is meant to make people laugh , and that's what it did. I had a good time with this movie . The actors do their work as they should , the imaging is also fine , as earlier said, the plot is rather stupid and transparent , but that's not an issue in these kind of movies. It does hesitate a bit between being a good laughing movie (the Amish spring break was hilarious)and a grose pee-poo-fart movie (certain bedroom scenes), and that aspect keeps it charming enough. The orange GTO 'Judge' is almost a character on its own , and for me, it was by far the most attractive one :-)",Sex Drive
84,thiagooliveira,Nothing special except for the donut costume,6,12 October 2008,"Since this film was a comedy let's look at it in that light first. I saw this movie about a week ago and it had about two hilarious moments which I am having a hard time remembering. The rest of the film most of the audience sat there in silence, with sporadic giggles throughout. My friends whom I watched the pre-screening with said they were amused in general but didn't find the film very funny. This is probably because this film strongly uses clichés and old ideas that have just been reshuffled with relatively little originality. The originality is this: The two main characters (the lead and his goofy friend) are in some sort of role reversal where their bodies and personalities are flipped and it's very hard to believe either can be themselves the way they are. The whole film I felt this way and and it was quite distracting, this may to some degree be attributed to the actors and Director failing to create believability and instead creating teen-comedy caricatures, but to the actors credit the three leads showed promise and could do better in a different movie.The comedy itself has a lot of preteen raunchiness that appears so often and so strongly that if you were to see a naked old man showing his gonads like in the movie ""Borat"" you wouldn't be very shocked or surprised. Normally this would be funny, like in the scene in ""American Pie"" with the the pie; but since this film holds very little meaning below the obvious surface gags, the comedy punch doesn't land strongly if at all that often.This film was also full of young beautiful actresses meant to portray the regular public as they cameo over and over again through most scenes. I don't recall one average looking young woman in the whole movie. This was slightly annoying because perhaps I was looking for something like ""Dazed and Confused"" and felt like was I was watching something a little better than ""American Pie 3"". What I mean is that this film is like ""Superbad"" where it's laden with raunchy teen comedy and some teen sexual angst. But unlike ""Superbad"" it doesn't have the deep underlying truths that elevate the script above boorish crude gags. If it weren't for those two hilarious scenes I failed to describe and perhaps the saving grace of the lead actors this film would be garbage. But it's not, and kudos to the Donut costume! If you are between the ages of 13-19 you'll probably like this film a bunch. Everybody else prepare to be mostly silently amused.6/10",Sex Drive

I don't use the theater to see naked people .It only bothers me when it's a gimmick, or so called over-the-top joke. The uncut 'Sex Drive' is basically a movie overlapping a soft-porn film (with (mostly) female and some male nudity) and quite frankly, gets old after awhile.

This movie isn't for all audiences, but if you enjoy humor about sex then you should enjoy this movie. The cast is really great and I laughed so many times.

Josh Zuckerman is likable in the John Cusack role, as is Amanda Crew standing in for Daphne Zuniga, but Clark Duke was less convincing as best friend and lothario, Lance, than was Anthony Edwards in the 1985 film, and I prefer Nicollette Sheridan as the ""sure thing"" going through her ""experimental phase"" to Katrina Bowden's more sinister ""Tasty."" I gave the older film 9 stars for better (and funnier) writing, Cusack's comedic touches (many of them improvised), Rob Reiner's talented direction, and an array of far more interesting and memorable secondary characters. I enjoyed Sex Drive more as an homage to the '85 ""classic"" than as a stand-alone film. See them both and compare, but if you only see one, go with The Sure Thing.",Sex Drive

If you go see Sex Drive for anything more that raunchy high school sex/road movie you will be gravely disappointing, I don't see a lot of attention from the academy for this one, but that all being said it is good for what it is.My only real beef with this movie is the ending. I'm not going to give anything away, but the denouement is not as strong as I would have liked it to be. But anyone knows any good road trip is not about the destination, it's about the journey.All and all the core cast is good, the supporting cast is better (Green, Marsden).

For while in my opinion there hasn't been any top teen movies until super bad came along and displayed an American pie style revamp and done it really really well.Sex Drive does this with road trip but even better. It has your gross out humour, funny stifler style brother, constant references to sex and some great one liners to quote.All in all I loved this movie...there are plenty of those who have talked to another person they want to meet online but never have...this movie takes the extra step and acts on that ""what if i did go meet them"" taking us on a messed up but brilliant adventure along the way!",Sex Drive
93,jtimmerman327,"Well worn material, but not without its charm",6,20 October 2008,"All in all, SexDrive wasn't a bad film. It obviously isn't Oscar-worthy, nor does it even stand out amongst its peers (while far stronger than College, it is on the same plain or perhaps a bit lower than Nick and Norah's). I entered this film with high hopes for it had a very strong trailer as witnessed before Tropic Thunder. Unfortunately, this film did not meet all expectations. The strongest performance was had by James Marsden, who continues his meteoric rise through the annals of Hollywood. The former X-Men, Enchanted and 27 Dresses man showed versatility as the bad-ass big brother of the main protagonist Ian.Ian himself was an unbelievably stereotyped character who was not at all realistic. I happen to be a sensitive, and in fact was involved in a relationship very similar to the friendship portrayed between the two main characters, however I can let you know that no one is that lame, and at no point did Ian seem real to me. The character development was extremely spotty. The audience never really was able to connect with any of the characters, and the story line was only engaging about half the time. The actual funny jokes were there though, and i guess that is the entire purpose of this film, therefore I guess it is more success than failure. I wish that they didn't focus so much on teenage stereotype and worked more into Amanda Crew's character because she is a beautiful young actress who could've used some more context.",Sex Drive

Sure there is gross Out humor, some nudity, extreme language a a tightly followed unexpected plot line and twists. Oh wait, last time I checked those are all great characteristics of a team comedy. The storyline divulged deep into each character and even played with emotions enough for you to love each character or hate to love each character. The over the top humor isn't the same old stuff, but well placed, well delivered (especially Seth green and Clark duke), and carefully thought out in the script.

I just couldn't stop laughing many times during the show and thats exactly what I expect for a comedy of that kind. Full of funny scenes it just kicks all the ""must be funny"" films asses. No doubt about it.Along with the cute staff it makes a great chance to have some entertainment during some evening. I just loved Seth Green character but everyone did their job very well. Today it is hard to see a good comedy when all the junk is being directed in a low cost of crappy sentences, ideas and scenarios. In few words its just worth seeing, you won't regret that for sure.

The comic situations are great in some moments and even unpredictable. I reckon it's a good film to watch with your girlfriend/boyfriend because it's funny.

102,weiss-maxi,Worth watching!,10,7 February 2009,"The name ""Sex Drive"" may awake false expectations for some viewers prior to watching. The movies goes beyond the typical ""american-pie-like-comedy-style"" and shows a sensitive development of relationships which were not expected at the beginning. These developments are combined with several road-trip experiences and different (of course, also sexual) experiences during the trip. But the film contains more than that, it has a nice plot, a stringent story and very talented young actors. It is definitely not just a teenage-flick, it is much more. Because despite some laughs, funny moments ( ""amish"") and unexpected action - we experience beautiful acting of Amanda Crew who didn't appear to me that intense in other movies before (like Final Destination for example). She does not only look beautiful but acts in a very authentic way, it seems to me like she enjoyed the set, the whole idea of the movie, and the acting in it especially (though the film had its rather crude moments at the beginning and in the step-mother appearances).I admit that this was one of the best teenage-road-movies I've seen in the last decade. Not only because it shows the lifestyle everybody would have loved to live in its teenage years, it also features both laughs and unexpected developments in the end, thoughts about the meaning of love and how important it is to trust feelings. A closer look at the character of Ian would have been great because during the whole movie he seemed a bit inapproachable, and we don't get an impression about his development of feelings towards Felicia, only the other way round.Summary: Funny movie with a very nice development in the end, and a fascinating and breath-taking Amanda Crew - worth watching!",Sex Drive
103,gavengi,Superbad - American Pie - Harold & Kumar = Sex Drive,3,8 February 2009,"Are you kidding me? This movie is either American Pie ten years too late, Harold and Kumar without anything funny, or Superbad minus the great script and acting. Wait, no... to my dismay, it's all three. It's hard for me to even write a review, but seeing as it's my first, I'll try.Main question: Why bother seeing this movie? I mean really, why? I'm not that picky. I'll enjoy most movies that at least entertain me. But I honestly struggled to sit through the whopping 120 minutes of this ""comedy"" crapfest.I realize it's being compared to every other movie in this genre, but rightly so. I saw American Pie waaaay back when I was entering high school, and this is basically the same thing. At least back then it was mostly original. But poop jokes? Still? Stifler? Still? Granted, he's the only thing that remains funny, reincarnated in the main character's brother, but even he holds on by a thread. Harold and Kumar brought a weird silliness to the genre, adding comedy from more esoteric stoner movies, and it was welcome and funny. And, well, fitting, since the movie's plot revolved around certain substances. Here, we have those same sort of hallucinationesque sequences, but with the lack of any sort of connection to... well... anything. And maybe the worst of all, where Superbad brought an original script and honest realism where you could really relate to the characters, and laugh at dialogue that didn't even seem like it was trying to be funny, the characters in this movie are just annoying. Stereotyped. REALLY ANNOYING.Ten years ago the idea of a goofy high-school guy trying desperately to get laid before his virginity put in its own pink slip may have been funny, but really? In 2009? I mean in what universe is this movie being filmed? This guy is decent looking. Charming enough. Not THAT awkward. Are there still honestly guys posing as football players online to try to get laid? No. Wait... Hmm... Did I timeslip? The entire concept of the movie is meeting a girl online. Even the repeating ""chat"" scenes. They try to disguise the horrible lack of originality by using sound effects more current than the tired AIM bleeps and with AMAZING OVERLAY CG GRAPHICS but seriously... you guys buy this? This movie is like a spattering together of all the scenes that didn't make it into any of the three films. It comprises of a now cliché story coupled with now cliché characters in now no-longer funny, cliché situations. Only a few funny scenes with Stifler and Seth Green, and the two weird stoner-meet-surfer-meet-2009 guys keep this movie from falling to a 2 or even a 1.

Had heard of it, and expected it to be the stereotypical teen exploitation film, filled with cardboard cutout characters representing an adult idea of what a young adult might want.Instead, it's a smart film with characters that represent actual humans, and with certain subtleties that you would never expect.You won't mistake it for Fellini, and there's plenty of the usual red-meat clichés of the genre, but it's closer to the mark than most, and clearly someone--writer, director?--had more in mind than just a cheap money making knockoff, although undoubtedly there were some participants who must have had that in mind too.The casting is smart. The Amish subplot is unexpected and works a few unexpected things. And the pick-up artist character (Lance?) is interestingly well drawn, written and acted with some unexpected depth. The lack of gratitude angle played out in the Seth Green subplot is one that I don't think has been done before in a film like this, and is actually a bit daring for a genre that mostly deals with tropes and flattery.",Sex Drive

Second, I really don't even have that much free time to waste on such a frivolous pursuit, but I hated this movie so much I really couldn't help myself. I'm at a loss to think of one redeeming quality anywhere in this film. From the blatant and unimaginative Stifler rip-off to the stupid, unattractive, dweeby male characters who think that if they're assholes, they'll get the chicks, this piece of work is a real piece of garbage, or vice versa. I get it. It's just a movie! Sure, but the problem is this type of movie is made specifically for and marketed directly to the dumbasses who think these characters' actions are funny and cool, and consequently emulate them. And what's with all the gay and dick references? After about two minutes of this crap fest it couldn't have been more obvious that the writer, director, producers, etc., are totally gay, and there's not one thing funny about it. Furthermore, what could have been at least one redeeming quality – the abundant use of a 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge, one of the coolest cars ever built – only served to incense me that much more because in short order I sat in genuine horror as I watched this awesome car being driven through corn fields and jumped, a la ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", over ditches and the like. Jesus, what a heart-breaking and shameful waste. There's not much worse than a writer, director, or producers who will trash a car like this just because they can. I won't even get into all the stupid and non-humorous plot points related to the Amish: how terribly un-funny. Blech! Save your time and money.

The directors warned you and you decided to watch it anyways.Overall the movie was excellent, it was funny and it really was the perfect movie for 11-1am where I just wanted to turn off my brain and laugh. I had seen it playing before on the movie channels and I had seen it listed on-demand for the movie channels I rent but the premise had always turned me off. It says, ""A high school senior drives cross-country with his best friends to hook up with a babe he met online."" Now, a few years back I watched a forgettable movie whose name I cannot recall where a dude had to save his girlfriend from like the Toronto film festival or some bullshit and the movie was god awful but I remember the premise being completely bland and uninspiring like what is listed for this movie.This movie however was amazing. There were no shortage of laughs and I think the only reason that this movie wasn't in the theaters was because of it's witty title. If it had been in the theaters and marketed I believe this film could have done at least better than American Pie (which is a terrible movie).After viewing this movie on-demand I feel obligated to go buy the bluray since I actually found it enjoyable enough to do so.",Sex Drive
112,burrmanchu-97160,Will make your face hurt.,10,12 April 2015,"Man, if you enjoy raunchy, hilarious stuff... Watch this movie. I had zero expectations and it was easily one of the funniest single things I've ever seen in my life. Mostly B Rate actors, but they absolutely nail their parts. The two kids in the Tokyo-drift-mobile are amazing. One of them is ""Scotty P"" from We're the Millers (when he was even younger)and should get way more work than he does. Seth Green as the Amish guy is untouchable. The ""Ode to Stiffler"" brother character is better than I could ever imagine.. Just watch it. Trust me. Best under the radar comedy in history. It's a usual Road Trip style, go-find-the-girl-and-get-laid story line, but the comedy writing is incredible and absolutely over the top. I swear I have probably never laughed so hard in my life. Whoever wrote this script is an absolute genius. It still blows my mind how many of my friends have not seen this, and every one I've told to watch it that actually has, now has it in their collection.",Sex Drive
113,adambro3,My favourite movie of all time,10,13 October 2019,"Im watching this movies when im drunk, when im high, and when im sober. Ive been watching this movie since i was 10 and now im 20. I can't get this vibe from any other movie. Its a masterpiece. 200% recommended.",Sex Drive
114,goalyguy333,Don't' Listen To Critics- Sex Drive Is Top 5 Comedies I've Ever Seen,10,23 February 2009,"There are several people who say that critics don't know anything... I find it funny in Hollywood how the best movies get rated terribly, and have a 28% rating on rottentomatoes 'tomatometer'...I saw the preview for Sex Drive on myspace. The preview started off as a typical drive-across-the-country crazy-things-happen teen sex party movie. About halfway into the trailer I found myself laughing... and thinking ""wow... something about this movie feels different. I think it's going to be really good. I don't want to wait til October, I want to watch it right now"".THREE WEEKS later three of my friends and I decided to see a last minute movie- I looked up Sex Drive only to find that it was only playing in one theater in our entire city (Denver) with only one showtime! 10:30 was the only showtime, if this was any indication of how the movie was I figured that it was going to be terrible- but I remembered how much I enjoyed the preview and coerced my friends to go see it. When we arrived the theater had only two other people in it, both middle-aged males sitting separately by themselves. Again- not a good sign...The movie started out, and was instantly funny. We laughed, so did the others. I thought, ""ok, any movie can make people laugh... it's not that hard a thing to do... let's see where this goes"". The movie continued on, and I found myself loving the plot. Loving the script. Loving the (no-name) actors. Loving the directing. Loving the editing. Loving everything about it. But that's just me... everyone has different opinions. My three friends (who- might I mind you, have very different senses of humor) all felt the exact same way. We were crying at certain parts because we were laughing so hard. The other (two) people in the theater were laughing hysterically as well. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better- the movie turns to a love story, and everything throughout the whole movie comes together.It finally ended, and I, and my three friends, sat there, in awe, about what we just saw. We left the theater and could not have been any happier about our movie choice.I returned home to instantly look up reviews online about what others thought of this movie- and it blew my mind. The most terrible, awful things were said, and the movie's gross domestic total? $8,402,485. A BOMB.I don't understand what it is people are looking for in a comedy. I will agree with others and say- yes, this has been done before. Yes, this movie is exactly what I thought it would be and what I wrote above (a typical drive-across-the-country crazy-things-happen teen sex party movie). Yes, this movie is predictable and familiar- but back to the question- what is it people are looking for in a comedy? This movie had every element of the $100,000,000+/movie American Pie series. Sex Drive should of made AT LEAST half that much.I saw College recently- NOW THIS is a movie that deserved it's abysmal earnings of 4.5 million dollars. College's jokes were cheap, and seemingly desperate, as if almost begging for a laugh. And once again- yes, College made me (slightly) laugh- as I said before any comedy can- but what it did not do was leave me with a feeling of sheer joy and happiness that I took the time out of my night (and life) to watch it. Sex Drive left me with this feeling.I believed Sex Drive to be perfect. In every aspect. I will address that, again, everyone's taste is different; everyone's brains interpret things differently and because of this not everyone will find Sex Drive to be perfect, in fact some may not find it funny it all- but I believe THE MAJORITY of people (9 out of 10) will realize, upon DVD release and word-of-mouth, that Sex Drive was the sleeper hit of 2008.See this movie. It deserves much more money than it made and is well, well worth your time.",Sex Drive
