0,nogodnomasters,Whiskey for my photographer,9,6 July 2021,This is a biopic of W. Eugene Simth's (Johnny Depp) last assignment as a photojournalist. He travels to Japan for Life magazine to take photo documents of the effects of Minamata Disease also known as Mercury poisoning.The film wasn't as much fun as Erin Brockovich. It had fewer light moments. Smith took black and white photos which makes things even more depressing. I foresee numerous nominations for Depp and the film.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,Minamata
1,Thanos_Alfie,Simply amazing...,7,23 October 2021,"""Minamata"" is a Drama movie in which we follow the photographer William Eugene Smith traveling to some coastal villages in Japan to capture with his camera the effect of mercury poisoning on people.I was simply amazed by this movie because it had an interesting plot that was based on real events and since I did not know about them I was shocked. The direction which was made by Andrew Levitas was very good and he presented very well the whole story behind mercury poisoning and he also did a good job on the way he used some old footage of that time. The interpretation of Johnny Depp who played as William Eugene Smith was simply outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Minami's who played as Aileen, Hiroyuki Sanada's who played as Mitsuo Yamazaki and Jun Kunimura's who played as Junichi Nojima. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Minamata"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because you will learn something about a huge environmental problem that affected many people and many families.",Minamata
2,imseeg,Warmhearted directed portrait of a community ravaged by chemical pollution.,8,22 October 2021,"Slowburning, warmhearted, shocking portrait of the destruction of children's health by chemical pollution in Japan.The story: Johnny Depp plays his usual clusmy, comical self, this time around he plays an American alcoholic master photographer. Out of the blue comes a Japanese woman at his door who asks him for his help to expose the pollution crimes through his photography.Impressive movie, which starts out rather lighthearted and sometimes even kinda comical, only near the very end the drama hits full on, when we as an audience get to see the many disfigured, handicapped children, ruined for life by the chemical pollution of the river from which they ate the fish...Produced by Johnny Depp himself. Based on true events...Please have the patience to watch the final credits, because at the end many similar chemical pollution catastrophes are being shown from around the world, including Europe and the USA.",Minamata
3,kwenchow,"A bit touching at certain point, but overall full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Should have done better!",1,7 October 2021,"This film start with a mother singing to her daughter, and the introduction of the main character ""Eugene"" scene! As turnout, this film is about a photojournalist ""Eugene"" need to expose the story of the Chisso Corporation causing the so called Minamata disease! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the smoking scene, overuse of the protesting scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the taking photo scene, overuse of the video recording scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the rinsing photo scene, overuse of the singing scene, and overuse of the song playing at the background scene! Make the film unwatchable! At the end, the Minamata Community won the lawsuit with Chisso Corporation! An article indicate Eugene died on October 15, 1978 at the very end! Still have a series of photo about the industrial pollution around the world alongside with the end credit! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Minamata
4,yusufpiskin,Welcome Back Mr. Depp,8,31 August 2021,"""Minamata"" is a disease that I was curious about while studying at the Faculty of Medicine.An amazing person, a unique photographer, W. Eugene Smith.The movie has a pretty good biography and stays away from fake drama. Because the story itself is already very painful.Andrew Levitas has done a great job of directing.Benoit Delhomme has created a magnificent composition with Sony camera and lenses.Ryuichi Sakamoto exclaimed that he was a master with every note of the music.And I was very happy to see J. Depp, whom I missed for a long time.Hiroyuki Sanada, you are an amazing detail.",Minamata
5,Alexander_Blanchett,Johnny Depp is great in this very important film,7,22 February 2020,"A solid and important film, especially these days with very recent topics. Its a story that deserved to be told at the cinema as it is groundbreaking, shocking and absolutely relevant. It also brings back Johnny Depp to his actually acting standards. Depp is wonderful, and not only because he successfully de-glammed for the role, but also because he found his acting weapons back. He truly gives a great performance in a film that sometimes suffers from its lengths. Because although the story is absolutely important to tell, director Andrew Levitas didn't really do where to go with it. He knew he wanted to tell it, he knew what he wanted to tell, but he didn't know how to put this in a 2 hours movie as there are some major lengths , especially in the midsection of the film And you sometimes had the impression this wold have worked better as a short film. To see Depp back to business it is worth to see and also to encounter newcomer Minami in the female lead is really something. She did great and shared a great chemistry with Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy also has his moments but can do better, his role was a bit underdeveloped. The song is amazing and there are many moments that are worth to mention, however as a whole it felt sometimes a bit too slow and without a definite direction.",Minamata
6,BrnzReviews,The King Has Returned 'Capturing' Sad Events.,9,28 July 2021,"King Johnny Depp has returned, this story alone is one that needed touching on to raise awareness as I'll be honest i was not aware of these issues until i saw this movie, it astonishes me how brutual it really was for Japan, these events are no joke, so tragic. The story being true made it all the more compelling in this movie, Depp steps deep into the character and does he do a good job, I'll be honest i have not seen such a great movie like this in a long time.I really enjoyed my time watching this movie, i felt so engaged and entertained all at the same time, it is a very intriguing title that does not feel boring at any moment and what a watch it was, i would definitely recommend this to all my friends, family and even you guys, watch this movie!Big props to the producer/director and entire crew for capturing this beautiful movie of such horrific events! A must watch!",Minamata
7,eskimosound,Depp is Brilliant...,10,2 October 2021,Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor. Once again he has transported me into another world. It's a terrible true story and very pertinent this day and age.,Minamata
8,anthonyjlangford,Depp a Star,9,11 June 2021,"Johnny Depp has what many actors don't. Even the current so called top tier ones. Charisma. Star power. Whatever that x factor is, he has it. And has done for 35 years. The fact that he has been cancelled by the Hollywood feminist/woke brigade is a disgrace. He has not been found guilty of anything. He initiated a defamation case that was not successful. The only person admitting to DV in a recording was that horrid entity he was with. Her career goes on and she can barely act. This man is a star. It's simply sexist hypocrisy. Put him back on the screen where he belongs.Is the film good? Yes. Well shot and directed. Interesting story. Is it great? No, not great but for every moment he's in it, it's elevated. He's perfectly cast for this charismatic figure because that's Johnny. He has the goods. And always has.",Minamata
9,Mivas_Greece,An excellent representation of one of the greatest pollution and human poisoning scandals. A great Johnny Depp. A movie everyone must see!,8,12 September 2021,"Historical / dramatic film. Filmed almost entirely in Japan, partly in Japanese, Minamata tells the story of the great mercury pollution scandal in Japan in the 1970s that resulted in the poisoning of thousands of people, including their children. Mercury has a direct neurodegenerative effect and can poison even the fetus before birth. A veteran photographer, in the decline of his career and now an alcoholic and broke, is finally persuaded to take photos and give this story to the rest of the world. However, the longer he lives with these people, the more he opposes the local industry that pollutes the environment. A true story with thousands of victims even today, one of the many sad stories of poisoning people and the environment, which becomes a movie like the relatively recent Dark Waters (2019) and Deepwater Horizon (2016). Excellent selection of Johnny Depp as producer and actor, one of his best films and one of the bright examples of showing such true events to be known to the broad audience. Recommended to everyone to learn the truth about these dark chapters of history.",Minamata
10,xiaohei-80112,3 point for the picture that shock the world,3,26 May 2021,JD didn't portray the legacy W. Eugene Smith well. Jd was just acting himself. So many shocking and intense event but director use a dull and boring story telling.luckily I searched the infor about this disease to keep myself awake the entire show. Youtube documentaries better than this movie.,Minamata
11,jmvscotland,"Finally, a good performance by Johnny Depp",8,20 August 2021,"Johnny Depp is one of my least favourite actors. Mostly, he's just horribly bad. Think here, all of the Pirates movies, Dark Shadows, The Tourist and Cry Baby.But, occasionally, just occasionally, he turns in a good performance, such as here in Minamata and in the past, in Finding Neverland, Sweeney Todd and Public Enemies.I was really surprised and delighted at his performance in Minamata. So, he can act after all.A tragic story, very well told and acted here with tight direction and a great script.8 out of 10 from me. This is a movie that's compelling and which I plan to watch regularly.JMV.",Minamata
12,dcarroll74,Good but....,8,18 August 2021,"A good movie about yet another abuse of citizens by big corporations however, it was badly let down by it's audio track.Parts of very important scenes could not be heard either, because of external noise (hospotal sierns), lowered voices, or misplacement of pickup mics. It detracted from what would otherwise be, an excellent movie.Most of the reviews I've seen have been in support of Johnny Depp because of recent events. Maybe it would have been better to focus on the movie itself, and not on Depp, who incidently, does give a good account of himself, not seen since Benny and Joon.",Minamata
13,tyesonbebee,After you watch this you'll see why corporations didn't want you to watch it.,10,13 August 2021,"The movie was a masterpiece, and one of if not the best performances by Johnny Depp. This is a must watch! Thank you!",Minamata
14,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A heartfelt real-life drama with a great performance by Johnny Depp,7,10 May 2021,"Minamata is a heartfelt contemplative real-life social drama which although plays beat-by-beat to the little man versus the corporation story formula, is elevated by the charming performances of Johnny Depp and its supporting cast.Eugene Smith, the photojournalist for Life Magazine, travels to Minamata, Japan to cover the local cases of severe mercury poisoning caused by the Chisso Corporation dumping industrial wastewater into the ocean.This is Johnny Depp's best performance in a long while. When it comes to Depp's roles, we tend to think of his larger-than-life wacky characters. There is a different electricity when he portrays real-life figures, like in Donnie Brasco, Finding Neverland, or The Libertine, that is often overlooked due to a lack of his signature character quirks. The task just seems simpler as Depp just focuses on being truthful and responsible to the real-life person.His portrayal of Eugene Smith seems like a distant cousin of Hunter S. Thompson, a cursed truth-speaker who constantly needs to self-medicate through drugs and joyous self-destruction. Despite the frizzy hair and a salt-and-pepper chin curtain beard, this is the least costumed he's been in a while and it is winning.It's surprisingly funny too as Depp injects gallows humor into his scenes as Eugene Smith is someone who has hit rock bottom and is reveling in how much he doesn't care anymore.We don't know what the real Eugene Smith acted like, but I'd bet good money that the ingredients for this characterization were a combination of secondary source accounts of Eugene Smith, Hunter S. Thompson, and Johnny Depp himself. What Depp was emoting felt real and raw like he was expressing something he wanted to say at this moment through his part.Hiroyuki Sanada shines in a supportive part as a lead protester against the Chisso Corporation. Sanada just has one of those charismatic faces that makes the audience root for whatever his character is crusading for onscreen, whether that's hating Tom Cruise, sword fighting with Hawkeye, or shooting a rope-dart at Sub-Zero.Director Andrew Levitas takes his time for the audience to sensitively familiarize with the various victims of Minamata and their families through the eyes of Eugene Smith. The cinematography uses the gorgeous Japanese backdrop for the audience to contemplate the severity of the situation.Slowly, you end up caring for the Minamata victims and their families. Minamata disease is quite a nightmare. I was biting my nails every time someone ate raw fish or sipped tea. I was even wondering what the real-life Eugene Smith, who stayed in Minamata for three-and-a-half years off of an original three-month assignment, was eating and drinking. The film's social message played twice as powerful as it eerily mirrored the nuclear disaster in Fukushima now.The middle of Minamata does sag just before the final act, almost like an instructor forgetting to set the timer in a free trial meditation class. I was suddenly woken up from a daze and the end wrapped up a tad too quickly.Steven Soderberg's Erin Brockovich, a movie similar in plot and theme, is comparatively better structured in terms of plot, but I enjoyed the meditative daze Minamata brought me in.There's a growing movie-going trend where the audience will only go to the theater to see big-budgeted blockbusters with special effects and slow-paced arthouse cinema is something that can be streamed later at home. That is not always the case. Cinema has a lot more to offer than that. After a year-long hiatus of not going to the cinema, watching Minamata retaught me that.",Minamata
15,margineanvladdaniel,"Not great, not terrible",7,10 June 2021,"They all played great, especially the sick ones. They did all they could. The story couldn't let them perform better. Beautiful colours, landscapes, pictures and photographs of course, and let's not forget the sound score. Well done! Glad to see Johnny again! Still waiting for the academy to award him. Not for a single performance, but for his entire career, he is a rare gem, we should cherish him forever!",Minamata
16,blackoutH,There's no shortage of stories about evil,8,21 August 2021,"We've heard and seen too many of these stories, greed and power has been a silent pandemic for centuries and it shows no sign of stopping.For some reason this movie doesn't seem to have the visibility it should, based on true events it portrays the story, captured by a photo journalist named Eugene Smith (Depp), of the Minamata disease originated by mercury poising causing horrific and irreversible symptoms to those affected by it.This happened on the city of Minamata in Japan, and yes you probably guessed it by now, a chemical plant was the responsible, contaminating the waters where people drank and ate killing and damaging thousands.We have once more a story about the loss of humanity, even though the administration was perfectly aware of the damages they were causing, everything kept being denied, people were bullied, bribed and completely ignored, to the point where it becomes clear all the money and greed should be also categorized as poison, the way it makes the best of men blind to such horrific events, is beyond my understanding.The movie from a directing standpoint doesn't have much to it, it's the story it tells that leaves an impact and of course, Johnny Depp's performance hits the spot, I haven't seen him showcasing is acting skills for some time, it was nice to see him back at his strongest!",Minamata
17,Hazu29,Beautiful Movie,8,23 July 2021,"A Beautiful Movie that no one promotes, I wonder why. It's even sad that people, mainstream media and twitter blue checks don't talk about this movie. Great Performance by Depp and by most of the cast, even by the ""real people"". Touching story. And of course the photography of this film is outstanding, but that's predictable.",Minamata
18,jos-dsouza,"Dull, boring and irritating",1,12 June 2021,"The Depp character is a drunk wasted one who suddenly reforms and is a hero. Maybe it's based on a true story...so are the other environment based movies. The movie slowly moves at a dull boring pace, and most of the time the drinking just gets irritating.Instead of this movie, see one based on global warming or the polar bear or mount everest.",Minamata
19,craigdales,Emotional true story drama.,8,6 June 2021,This was a great film with great performances especially from johnny Depp. I still believe johnny Depp is one of the best actors out there. It was sad news to hear that he's been dropped from Disney and Warner bros. Don't you think he got punished enough in his private life. Now his work it's ashame were gonna lose one of the top actors there is these few decades. But he will be back as long as his good friends stick by him like TIM BURTON. Anyway this film is well recommended I can't believe this actually happened but it is Japan they don't care about there people never have never will there a disgrace.,Minamata
20,kelvynchin,"Great movie, powerful and moving",9,8 June 2021,"Andrew Levitas's telling of feted photojournalist W Eugene Smith's fight to bring a face to the victims of an industrial poisoning in Japan in the 70's is one of the great movies of the year, with a powerhouse performance by Johnny Depp - who digs deep into a mire of self loathing and alcohol to find courage to go against a large multinational (the Chisson corp of Japan). Pic reaches a moving and poignant conclusion as the screen segues into the stark stills of Smith's photos. At turns heartbreaking and triumphant, this movie is a must watch.",Minamata
21,mickman91-1,Important story. Nice presentation of it which is neither overly sentiment nor too dry,6,8 November 2021,"Touching story that needs to be told, however the subject matter means this film is never going to reach a large audience. There aren't many dramatic events it's just a true story told simply but quite well. It also isn't totally dry nor overly dialogue heavy. There are some touching moments but really the poignancy comes from knowing that it is based on true events and the reading you do on Wikipedia about it while you're watching the film. It also attempts to be a kind of biopic of w eugene smith but doesn't really commit to that as it fears detracting from the core story, and I think this is appropriate. Difficult to know who to recommend this to, but if you are a person who finds it difficult to turn the other cheek when you hear about the plight of others and you feel obliged once you are made aware of something to know more about what happened then you will find this a well put together film to experience while you're finding out more about minimata.",Minamata
22,shawthingproductions,Could have been more,8,7 February 2021,"Depp acted head and shoulders above his cast and further shows his capabilities as an actor, after seemingly bringing Jack Sparrow to too many roles before. The film itself was a tough watch due to the upsetting content. The titles at the end are eye opening.",Minamata
23,theoisod,bore fest,1,24 August 2021,"This will prolly get downvoted to hell since there seems to be a hell lot of depp fangirls around here but what the heck
the subject has been treated way better in a more profound, sensible way in some other movies
everything in this movie is dull, boring, colorless. All the famous japanese actors were all so uninteresting in this movie, even though they can all act so well in a fully japanese language film.Depp on the other hand has no excuse. Not a shade of genuine emotion was found throughout the whole movie. His act of being a drunk looked reluctant and fake , prolly from the fact he had to to sober up real quick irl these past few years thanks to his legal problems.Save 2 hrs of your beautiful life.",Minamata
24,sushant0406,Johnny Depp gives a great performance in this beautifully haunting movie,8,12 June 2021,"Minamata is a must-watch for all cinema lovers to appreciate the cinematography, direction and the choice of background scores used, about the Minamata disease that caused havoc in the early 1970s.Johnny Depp, perhaps one of the greatest and most versatile actors of all time, turns in a powerful and sombre performance where he is able to emote mostly from his eyes. Once again, he goes right into the skin of the character in this case, the late Eugene Smith and is definitely worthy a performance to ATLEAST an Academy Award nomination. Bill Nighy is good in an extended cameo. Minami is very good in her role as well.To summarise, this movie is a must watch for Johnny Depp's excellent performance, his best since Black Mass, and the topic of mercury poising and the environmental damage by conglomerates, which I personally believe needs to receive more attention. This movie personofies art & cinema's true purpose.",Minamata
25,seanfitz-51998,Johnny Depp shows why he's a legendary actor.,10,26 June 2020,Johnny Depp puts in an expected interesting performance but mature. It's as if he's found a different gear in his talent. This movie is powerful and strangely necessary as a result of current times. Well made and there is so much unknown talent in this movie on camera and off and one of the reasons I praised Johnny for a mature performance was because he made those around him go up a gear. Sometimes you can sense competition between actors in award contending movies but Johnny allowed others to shine as well as shining himself to a very high standard perhaps his best performance in years.,Minamata
26,dpaunica,Oscar material: shame on MGM for burying the movie,10,27 September 2021,"Great Johnny Depp / Bill Nighy performances, together with all the Japanese cast.Director Andrew Levitas has sent a letter of complaint to MGM and other parties to protest the decision to bury the film because of the alledged issues of its star, Johnny Depp... and insulting one more time the many victims of Minamata.In a stark reminder of The Chisso Corp actions in Minamata and many other large corporations' unethical tactics, MGM stated that it would live up to its ""legal obligation"" and nothing more...",Minamata
27,semogamer,Johnny Depp is a LEGEND of Hollywood,10,12 August 2021,"Tomoko Uemura in Her Bath is a photograph taken by American photojournalist W. Eugene Smith in 1971. Many commentators regard Tomoko as Smith's greatest work. The black-and-white photo depicts a mother cradling her severely deformed, naked daughter in a traditional Japanese bathroom. The mother, Ryoko Uemura, agreed to deliberately pose the startlingly intimate photograph with Smith to illustrate the terrible effects of Minamata disease (a type of mercury poisoning) on the body and mind of her daughter Tomoko. Upon publication the photo became world-famous, significantly raising the international profile of Minamata disease and the struggle of the victims for recognition and compensation. At the wishes of Tomoko Uemura's family, the photograph was withdrawn from further publication in 1997, 20 years after Tomoko's death.",Minamata

37,nlaing1,Try to ignore the crusaders pushing the score up,1,26 August 2021,"First off, if you read through all the glowing 10/10 reviews, you will come across long pointless rants about Depp being wrongly cancelled for ""allegedly"" beating his partner. I don't know where this sudden obsession with taking your political frustrations out on the ratings system of movies has come from, but all it has succeeded in doing is making me wary of believing it.I'm gonna try and balance the scoring a bit because this is by no means an excellent movie. An important movie, a story that needed to be told, and it was well done in a lot of ways...... but again nothing outstanding at all.Johnny Depp is miscast, and honestly was the worst part of the film.I definitely recommend watching it, but be warned that it is a very sad and angering subject.

Eugene Smith ,( considered as one of the most important photo journalists ever) into Japan to report the story of the Minamata poisoning.Depp is in his elements portraying the disinterested alcoholic photographer effortlessly.It's a haunting tale of one of the worst industrial accidents, beautifully told. Director Andrew Levitans use of colours and lighting is both inspiring and moving.Throughout the movie we get to see snapshots of the beautiful black and white images that Eugene presented to the world, in particular his most recognised photo of Tomoko and mother in Bath.I really don't get some people who call this movie slow .

40,cupofteatime,Minamata A story that needs to be told,10,15 August 2021,"A profoundly moving retelling of the tragedy of Minamata, Japan.. This film is an outstanding tribute to the tenacity of the Minamata community in their fight for justice and recognition for the untold suffering they endured and died from following the mercury, they unknowingly ingested, from the fish they ate that had been effected by the contaminated water pumped into the sea near their coastal community by Chisso Corp.Johnny Depp as W Eugene Smith the honoured photojournalist at Life magazine they contact to highlight their cause to the global community, is superb in this role as the aging, substance abused, debt ridden photographer. He has a presence but his measured performance never overshadows the story of the people of the fishing community and their protest actions to make the factory owners accept their responsibility: his story runs parallel with theirs, thanks to the director Andrew Levitas vision for the film.All the actors participating are well cast and convey their parts convincingly. The cinematography is superb, as is the soundtrack.This film is a powerful yet sensitive tribute to the Victims of mercury poisoning.Watch the end credits, they highlight the fact that industrial poisoning, in its various forms, still continues to this day.Mercury poisoning, is now a recognised neurological disease ..... Minamata Disease..",Minamata

I am not going to write about charm and charisma, I will only note that all actors fall into two categories. The play of the first ceases to be perceived as a game and begins to be seen as life. The character comes to life. The play of the latter can be good or bad, but it is always clear that it is just a play. Depp belongs to the first category.",Minamata

50,kimgaumond,"Heartbreaking, Breathtaking, necessary.",10,15 August 2021,"This movie was amazing. The camera shots are beautiful, the soundtrack is magnificent and the actors are incredible. Johnny Depp melts into the character so much that he is almost unrecognizable. This sad story needed to be told and this movie tells it brilliantly. Oscar worthy movie and performance by Depp.",Minamata

56,fromannabelsbrain,A 'Sneak Preview' film review / Support US release,10,17 August 2021,"As the movie starts, the first thing I feel is how drawn I am into the world of W. Eugune Smith. The cluttered work space of an artistic mind ticking over. In his element, chosen pictures are carefully developed and he plays with light and touch, and darkroom with it's red light on, the walls busy with images, the floor littered with the graveyard of discarded pictures that he walks on. He is a hands-on perfectionist, an artist realising his craft like a sculptor finding the figure in the stone. There is an authenticity to his surroundings, music and what he's wearing, the way he moves and I have completely forgotten who the actor is.And that's what Johnny Depp does, he portrays believable characters that transport me to another world so I can watch a film with fresh eyes, taking in the new character, his interaction with surroundings and other people in the cast.Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme follows Eugene in a handheld style that I find draws me in more. Production designer Tom Foden and Art Director Dragan Kaplarevic have made an accurate and thorough depiction of the 70's. There are many more talented people working hard behind the scenes to bring this story to the screen even before we can praise the Cast. They have crafted a highly respectful look into the lives of the Minamata people and their long suffering. While the film has a beautiful cinematic quality (made for the big screen), it has been cleverly coupled with camera movement in keeping with the era. To me, this offers a closeness, a documentary feel, as we follow Eugene and start to see how he sees the world from his point of view.****************************************
The film has been well received internationally with ""Minamata"" having its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 21, 2020. In October 2020, MGM, through its relaunched American International Pictures banner, acquired US distribution rights to the film. It was scheduled for February 5, 2021 but these were postponed TBA. On July 26, 2021, Director Andrew Levitas sent MGM a letter alleging that it had decided to ""bury the film"" in response to the decline in the public image of Depp, and urging MGM to give the film a wider distribution and promotion. An MGM spokesperson told Deadline, ""Minamata continues to be among future AIP releases and at this time, the film's U. S. release date is TBA.""_WikipediaSuch an important film as this should not be silenced and ""The People"" are encouraged to speak up in support of the US release by contacting Sam Wollman at the MGM Studios directly.",Minamata

73,lehlioman-1,Pretty dull,5,22 May 2021,It is an important story to tell but it could have been told in a more engaging manner. Johnny's character is grouchy and disinterested most of the time. The two leads have little chemistry and no one could have guessed that the characters are actually married to each other. A wasted opportunity on the whole.,Minamata

75,catloverjac,Johnny Depp gives another memorable performance in a must see movie,10,15 January 2021,"Johnny Depp is truly wonderful in this role. His portrayal of W. Eugene Smith is multi dimensional. His performance brings us to a place not many have known, the victims of Minamata. While taking place in the 70's.. it is still on track for what is happening today.. How we are destroying ourselves. How these people are still suffering even now. With his name power, Mr. Depp brings an uncomfortable subject to the public, one they would normally not see. Again and again Mr. Depp proves why he has been proclaimed one of the greatest actors of our generation. This movie is incredible, with a story we all should know. With a supporting cast of international actors all at the top of their game.",Minamata

108,emadrz-88189,johnny depp,10,9 June 2021,Johnny Depp puts in an expected interesting performance but mature. It's as if he's found a different gear in his talent. This movie is powerful and strangely necessary as a result of current times. Well made and there is so much unknown talent in this movie on camera and off and one of the reasons I praised Johnny for a mature performance was because he made those around him go up a gear. Sometimes you can sense competition between actors in award contending movies but Johnny allowed others to shine as well as shining himself to a very high standard perhaps his best performance in years.,Minamata

I'm gobsmatched by the acting of the actors there. Yeah, the director showed us the daily life of the japanese people on the Minamata, and it causes trully goosebams. They completely exhausted and need world's attention. They need to be noticed on the global level. I'm on the same page with those who thinking about non-material issues in our lives, and those who continue fighting for the equal rights. If you watch it, you will not regret about it.
