0,Leofwine_draca,Watch it for Hardy,6,20 November 2011,"The real-life story of Britain's toughest prisoner, and not a film I would choose to watch – except when it comes to the casting of the lead actor. Tom Hardy, who I've noticed cropping up more and more in recent years, gives a tour-de-force performance as a psychotic inmate and man to whom violence is a way of life. His eerie voice, hulking frame and dead eyes all combine perfectly to make him one of cinema's most memorable villains in recent years, and with most of the scenes consisting of him speaking monologues in solitary cells, the film belongs to him.Which is good, because the story isn't up to much. It's a loose dramatisation of the life of Michael Peterson, a man who robbed a post office and ended up becoming Charles Bronson, one of the most famous convicts of all time. To be honest, the events aren't all that interesting, and in other hands the continuous brawls with prison officers could become repetitive. Thank Heaven then for the presence of Nicolas Winding Refn (VALHALLA RISING) as director. This is a guy who understands cinema and the beauty of cinema, and he makes the film intensely watchable as a result. BRONSON looks a thing of beauty, even if that beauty is stark, brutal and minimalistic.",Bronson
1,SnoopyStyle,great Tom Hardy,7,6 October 2015,"Michael Gordon Peterson (Tom Hardy) is a notorious British prisoner after being juvenile delinquent and then in 1974, sentenced to 7 years for post office robbery. It's a volatile incarceration and spends much of it in solitary. In 1988, he was finally released after time added and begin a career as a bare knuckle boxing with the name Charles Bronson. He continues to get into trouble with the law and returns to prison.By the style of the movie, it is an attempt by the character Bronson to explain his life to the audience. It's an interesting idea. It's a total character study and a great opportunity for Tom Hardy. As for the watchability, it has its slow parts and it struggles to find the flow. Violence can come out of nowhere. Overall, it's a great performance in an artistically challenging movie.",Bronson
2,Prismark10,The bulldog breed,7,5 December 2014,"Charles Bronson the notorious prisoner who took the name from the more famous actor has achieved almost celebrity status with decades spent behind bars. In essence two acts of robbery has lead to lengthy jail sentence because of his behaviour in prison.Tom Hardy who probably came to people's attention when he played an experimental clone of Captain Picard in Star Trek: Nemesis bulked up to play Brosnan and with director Nicolas Winding Refn, we have a stylised and avantgarde film which does not glorify Bronson but presents him someone who is institutionalised, a man who has reached a stage where he cannot contemplate life in the outside and hence his violent behaviour in prison.Bronson narrates the film like a music hall star, with Refn at the helm this is not a low budget Brit flick 'Scum' wannabee with Ray Winstone in a starring role. Instead its a violent, disturbing but thoughtful and even sensitive film. A fantasy portrayal of a disturbed man.",Bronson
3,jboothmillard,Bronson,6,20 November 2011,"I think I saw this film briefly mentioned on Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross, and it looked a really interesting British film, and then I found out more about what it involved, so I was wanting to see it very much. Based on the true story, set in 1974, Michael Peterson (Star Trek: Nemesis's Tom Hardy) is the hot-headed bare-hand boxer who wanted to be famous for something, perhaps an actor or stage performer, but he instead turned to a life of crime. He was committed to jail after stealing money from his work, and kissing a young woman working there, who he goes on to marry and have a child with. Petersen goes to jail again after robbing a post office, and he realises he gets a buzz and thrives on life in prison, seeing it like a hotel room, and tormenting the guards he finds his fame and stardom, with the admiration of other inmates. He switches to a numerous amount of prisons that all try to handle his violent behaviour and aggressive antics, until he eventually goes to be constantly sedated in a psychiatric hospital. Meeting a man who seems to be sympathetic but turns out to be a paedophile wanting to rape a nine year old girl, Petersen gets really furious and, after pending days calm, eventually tries to strangle the man, so he is sent to the high security psychiatric hospital, Broadmoor. There is news that these facilities are low on money to keep prisoners like Petersen inside, and with no alternative his is claimed and sentenced sane, to be released into the general population. While out he decides with the suggestion from his friend Paul Daniels (Peep Show's Matt King) to give himself the new name Charles 'Charlie' Bronson, after the famous star of the movie Death Wish, and reignites his career in bare knuckle fighting, until he steals a ring to propose to woman and gets arrested again. Back in prison he once again starts fights with the guards, extending his sentence, and he becomes more sophisticated with his violent outbursts, including being naked and holding one prisoner in his cell, and tying one up to turn him into a piece of his art. The film ends with text saying Petersen, or rather Bronson, has not been given a release date, and explaining that he has achieved his goal of becoming a star, as the most famous prisoner in Britain (and probably one of the most dangerous prisoners). Also starring Hugh Ross as Uncle Jack, Juliet Oldfield as Alison, James Lance as Phil, Amanda Burton as Charlie's Mum, Kelly Adams as Irene and Joe Tucker as John White. In the title role, Hardy, with the bald head and big black moustache, is absolutely magnificent being the man who has spent two-thirds of his life behind bars and in solitary confinement, the stylised fantasies from the character make for good viewing, and despite disturbing violence and extreme behaviour he does almost become human, it is a great biographical prison drama. Good!",Bronson
4,Quinoa1984,"a curiously enraged tosser of a movie, equally entertaining and, oddly, dull",8,16 February 2010,"Nicholas Winding Refn's film doesn't for a second let us feel anything for Bronson, except that he truly does deserve the title of ""Britain's Most Violent Prisoner"". The tone of the film is that of a life abstracted from itself, a man who views himself from a stage, and from a confessional black space, and just as he was, and it's an experimental feat that will remind some of A Clockwork Orange (cause, you know, violent bloke plus classical music) and others of Lola Montes (for the kaleidoscopic view of a life lived as a showbiz personality, or would-be one). Much of the film is meant as pure entertainment, not a psychological breakdown of this guy. Maybe there isn't much more to tell, and that Bronson, or Mickey Peterson, was just a brutal f***-ed up thug who should stay behind bars. But then I started to think: really, what's the point then? There's also a kind of disconnect with the experimental form, very loosely structured though in a linear time-line in Bronson's life in and sometimes not in prison, and Bronson as a character. Refn's talent extends out like a cage rattler, but it should have gone even further. After a while it gets a little tiring, actually, to return to that image of a clown-faced Bronson on stage giving a packed audience a show and a half. It becomes predictable, despite how radical Refn does, or thinks he does, filming the Bronson from his 'dramatized' scenes to his inner-landscape of wanting fame and notoriety. I knew it would come back around to it, and it becomes more of a gimmick, a plot device, stringing along the narrative as opposed to the narrative working hard for itself. Or, if this doesn't make sense, frankly, the film's structure and change in moods made me feel uneasy, and not always in the good intentional queasy way of underground independent cinema.But don't get me wrong, Bronson does have a lot to recommend for it. Some scenes are just flat-out funny, like when Bronson does a rather poor job stealing a ring from a jeweler (or, he gets away, but explains ""wait ten minutes to call"" in such a calm, deadpan vice), or stick out as being really compelling and perfectly strange like when Bronson is put in a mental asylum as a means to tame the beast (how he gets out of it, by the way, is a wicked kind of genius). It's also thrilling to see an actor like Tom Hardy take on the role with such mania and skill. This is not a person one can like much, and only one or two moments is sympathy allowed or possible, and otherwise we see him just as the monster he was. For any actor this is a challenge, but when done right, such as here, it's enlightening. It's not quite as great as the performance (or just character) everyone's comparing it to- Alex in Clockwork Orange- but on its own terms it works as a contained force of rage and madness. He's an anti-hero that would make Jake La Motta cringe.Oh, there's also plenty of scenes showcasing some wicked cinematography (wicked in a complimentary sense I mean), and a fine, strange mix of classical tunes and 80's synth-pop music. But by the end, something just didn't sit totally right with me with Bronson. It's audacious and cleverly filmed, but it doesn't take off from the promise of its opening minutes, drifting along on the a story that is actually shorter than expected, and after a while the sameness of the structure is what kind of gets it down. This should either be a straightforward narrative or something so gonzo it would make Takashi Miike run for the hills. Instead it's in a semi-comfortable middle. 6.5/10",Bronson
5,Coventry,I'll be what I am ... a solitary man,8,16 January 2011,"Ambition is one of the most important things in life to have  Whether it's in your personal or professional life, ambition and achieving goals is what keeps you going. ""Bronson"", co-written and directed by the multi-talented Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, is basically a story about one man's ambition as well, albeit the strangest and most disturbing I ever heard. ""Bronson"" tells the story of Michael Peterson; a man who may proudly call himself Britain's most violent prisoner. Peterson got imprisoned in 1974, following a relatively banal armed robbery incident, but ever since then he spent a total 34 years behind bars, of which 30 years in solitary confinement no less. Michael Peterson just has an extremely explosive personality and regularly hijacks fellow inmates or staff members in his cell to evoke a physical confrontation with as many armed guards as possible. During these hijacking situations, Peterson doesn't make commands or requests favors, he simply waits until the time is right and then simply prepares for a good old-fashioned bare knuckle fight in the nude! Throughout his ""career"" in and out of prison, he temporarily became a professional fighter and changed his name to Charlie Bronson, because he's tough and relentless. ""Bronson"" is a peculiar but admirably successful drama/semi- biography. Just how difficult is it to draw a portrait about a criminal who, in fact, never murdered or raped anyone in his entire life and yet easily can be considered as one of the most disturbing human beings on the planet? Nicolas Winding Refn delivered a powerful and deeply impressive motion picture, mostly thanks to an original narrative structure and a respectable approach of the subject matter. Michael ""Charlie Bronson"" Peterson supposedly narrates the movie himself, partially from inside his prison cell and partially on a theater stage dressed up like a clown. The latter POV masterfully illustrates Peterson's hunger for recognition and fame whereas the prison setting reflects his true introvert and dangerously disturbed personality. Multiple sequences are also downright petrifying and offensive, like the dance scene to Pet Shop Boys' ""It's a Sin"" inside the mental asylum. Of course, the movie undoubtedly also owes a lot of its tremendous impact to the staggering performance of Tom Hardy. He clearly put a lot of devotion and preparation into the role, but it surely paid off. Terrific, original and highly recommended film.",Bronson
6,Theo Robertson,"The Man , The Myth , The Celebrity, But Mainly The Myth All In A Mess Of A Movie",5,15 November 2011,"There's something very disturbing about the British psyche , especially when it comes to crime . Consider vigilante movies made in America where someone goes around killing criminals simply because they're criminals and who are murdered in an egalitarian moral crusade . Not like in Britain where vigilantes seen in OUTLAW , DEAD MAN'S SHOES etc have to have nonces ( sex offenders )as their victims . In many ways the British mentality makes a very thick dividing line between "" good criminals "" and "" bad criminals "" . In other words it's okay to be a criminal as long as you don't hurt women , kids and old people and you don't grass up your mates . I'm as guilty as anyone for having this mentality and I'm intrigued by Michael Peterson aka Charles Bronson so made a point of watching this bio-pic Perhaps I should have read a book instead since Bronson's life story is something that's not of a prime concern to the director Nicholas Winding Refn . Instead Refn concentrates on getting a performance out of Tom Hardy . This isn't necessarily a criticism because nearly everyone on this page has praised Hardy but the performance is one of a literal theatrical manner . The acting could have best been fitted on a stage and this is what Refn does for major parts of the film with Hardy giving a soliloquy . In order to make the film seem more cinematic Refn then pulls out every directorial technique known to man with animation , ramping and loud intrusive music . Intetesting the number of people stating that it owes a lot to Kubrick , Stone and Tarentino . It's all these things which means the film has no idiosyncratic feel of its own . One would have perhaps seen a more expressionistic film detailing the lonely hell of Bronson's solitary confinement , imagine what Darren Aronofsky might have done with the screenplay . Instead we have a film where the lead actor is shouting "" Oh look method acting "" while the director is showing off to no avail",Bronson
7,LeonLouisRicci,Fancy Hyper-Fiction,7,10 January 2014,"""Britain's Most Violent Prisoner""...""Britain's Most Expensive Prisoner""...These Blurbs are Everywhere in Connection to this Movie and the Real Life Inmate Michael Peterson aka Charlie Bronson.You won't get much of a Feeling for either Hyperbole from this Artsy Movie. It is a Surreal attempt to tell the True Story in a way that is neither that Violent or Disturbing. It comes along Portraying this Bloke as a Buffoon that is Big on ""making a scene"".The Film is quite Sharp with its Stylish Set-Pieces and is an Exercise more than an Expose. There is a Strong Performance and it is a Method Piece that doesn't Range too Far and to be a bit Critical it only has one or two Notes. But they are Certainly in Tune with the Movie's Sensibility.The Scenes that are meant to be the Most Disturbing are Hiccups in this Otherwise Operatic and Flamboyant, Over the Top Movie. The Director is most at Home with the ""Art"" Aesthetic and the Violent or Fight Scenes are not that Effective and seem Mild in Comparison to other Cinematic Takes on such Behavior. The Fighting is Far from Brutal as these Things go and maybe that is by Design.Because this is a Detached Display of a Disturbed Individual that is mostly Surface and never really Cuts to the Bone. It is Hyper-Fiction and is at Times quite Engaging. But it Hardly ever seems like Anything close to Reality. As a work of Fancy Fiction it is a Presentation more than a Pronunciation of the Penal System or Abnormal Psychology.It all Works as a Heightened Cultural Piece but has Little to do with True Crime and as such it is a Different and Extraordinary Film.",Bronson
8,dbborroughs,Tom Hardy turns in a performance that may very well become a screen icon in the story of the most famous British prisoner,9,20 June 2009,"A version (there are lots of changes) of the life and times of Michael Peterson, who changed his name to Charles Bronson during his stint as a bare knuckles boxer. Bronson is known as both England's most famous prisoner and its most expensive because of the damage he has inflicted on people and property.I completely understand why attempts were made to ban this film. The Bronson of this film is supreme antihero, a take no prisoner sort of guy (in a manner of speaking) who liked to break heads. Its done in a manner that is quite humorous and in such away that even though he is doing terrible things you actually like the guy. The families of the men he's injured and took prisoner are upset that this monster is made into any sort of likable guy.The film as it stands is a surreal look at the life of Bronson. He is telling us, the film audience, as well as an audience in a theater his tale. It goes from his early life to the point where his artistic talent is realized (Bronson is an artist and a author of some repute). Things are often highly stylized with amped up support from a music soundtrack that uses everything from Pet Shop Boys to Wagner. This is Bronson's story and he's telling it and one can not help but be drawn in. Its masterful story telling.The reason the film works at the high level (its one of the best films I've seen this year) is Tom Hardy who plays Bronson with a nod and wink and a sense of person. This is no performance this is Bronson incarnate. Its one of those performances where you watch and know that if there is any justice all of the awards will be his. Its the equivalent of Heath Ledger and Joker, Anthony Hopkins and Lechter, Yul Brenner and the King and I. Its an iconic role. Its a potentially superstar making role and I can't say a bad word about it. Trust me Hardy is great, its simply amazing to watch him for 95 minutes take the screen and hold it in a choking death grip.I highly recommend this film. But be warned this is a film about a bad guy so there is tons of foul language, full frontal male nudity and more than its share of violence. It also has a wicked wicked sense of humor which takes a little bit of the edge off it.See this film.",Bronson
9,siderite,"Great performance from Hardy, but a minimalistic film about a stupid confused violent man",7,20 January 2019,"Tom Hardy's character is described by violence. He doesn't know what he wants and he seems to only crave violence. Speak to him in a nice and/or intellectual way and he feels threatened and lashes out. The only bit of romance he has is with a girl who uses him as a piece of muscular meat. I don't even think that's taken from Peterson's life. I know a person that is exactly like him, only not even violent, and I think he's mentally challenged. The only reason to praise and watch this movie is Refn's take on it and Hardy's performance, because the subject is nothing at all.",Bronson
10,KineticSeoul,The show must go on!,6,2 February 2011,"The script isn't anything great, but the direction is still entertaining and so is Tom Hardy performance. Michael Peterson aka Charles Bronson(Tom Hardy) is known as the England's most violent prisoner and that is basically what this plot is about. And it's suppose to be based on a true story, about this violent and not really evil criminal. Bronson had a normal childhood but he wanted to become famous and the thing that he was the best at was fighting. And most of the movie is about the aggressiveness of Bronson and how he doesn't take crap from anyone. This man isn't anyone to look up to, but he still is a interesting and entertaining character to watch. Especially because of the fantastic performance by Tom Hardy. His character isn't necessarily evil, just a bit psychotic and loves to fight anyone. Which is a shame cause he could have made a name for himself in the UFC or something. On the negative side the I felt some of the back story was missing and sort of random at times and didn't think there wasn't that much insight on Bronson. Like some reviewers are saying, it really isn't a challenging film for the actors or the audiences. But it was still interesting to some degree and entertaining for the most part.6.8/10",Bronson
11,FeastMode,my notes,5,1 July 2019,"This movie started out very interesting and entertaining. then it got weirder and weirder, worse and worse as it went on. overall it was pretty bad. Tom Hardy's acting job is so impressive. he seriously can do anything. (1 viewing)",Bronson
12,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Unfocused, kind of pretentious quasi-indie examination",4,8 December 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Director Nicolas Winding Refn has a controversial subject matter on his hands here, in the shape of Charles Bronson (Tom Hardy) Britain's most infamous prisoner who from an armed robbery on a post office when times were hard in the early 70s has been in jail for over thirty years, with quite a significant amount of it in solitary. He is officially Britain's most violent prisoner, and as everyone found out at the film's premiere, he's not proud of it but not ashamed of it either.'Celebrity culture' is everywhere nowadays, from TV shows like the now defunct Big Brother, to magazines such as Heat and OK! But while appearing naked or going on a reality show provides the springboard for most people, here is a profile of a man who all his life has been just as eager for fame as Jordan but who's gone about getting noticed in a far more subcultural way, a wild, uncontrollable rebel with no boundaries and a psychotic love of spontaneous, savage violence. He provides an interesting variation on getting noticed with no talent, that's for sure. If nothing else, the film manages to be a curious and relevant statement on the way the fame game works today, what with everything the way it is and people loving fame the way they do.In the lead role, Hardy does a pretty decent job of portraying Bronson, with his un-nerving stares and sudden, harsh laughs, capturing the essence of a man who can't accept authority and refuses to conform to society's version of 'acceptable.' It's brave subject material to bring to the screen, the trouble is director Refn has saturated it all with an art house feel that takes the narrative flow off track, with Charlie branching off into weird trips into his own little world where he regales an empty theatre with his life story, throwing his intensity and humour at them with all he's got but losing the film's real audience at the first hurdle. After a while, it's all got too deep and off track for it's own good, i.e. playing classical music over Bronson beating up a bunch of guards, and it's left with a pretentious feel that actually deviates from telling his life story in an interesting way.It's decent enough independent film-making that might find a cult audience with some but will just feel like a missed opportunity to a lot of others. **",Bronson
13,bowmanblue,Nice film about not a nice man,7,24 February 2015,"I've watched Bronson twice now. The first time I thought it was okay. Then second time I liked it a lot more. It's one of those films that grows on you.It's about Britain's most violent inmate of Her Majesty's prisons, Charles Bronson. It shows a (rough) depiction of his life, how he got where he is (in jail) and not much else.Some may say there's not much story to it - Bronson gets into fights. He gets locked up again. Repeat for nearly ninety minutes.However, if nothing else, the film allows Tom Hardy to flex his acting muscles (along with those he built up physically for the part). He gives a pretty chilling performance of a true psychopath. Add into this a little bit of art house-type film-making and a contrasting soundtrack featuring the Pet Shop Boys and New Order and you have a nasty little surreal film.It has some pretty memorable scenes in it. I'm glad I gave it a second viewing. I'll probably watch it again, but it's not a film you could probably watch often. In a couple of years again, I may well appreciate watching a madman dancing badly to some eighties electro pop.",Bronson
14,lesleyharris30,"An Overly Artsy Affair is Saved by Hardy,",7,15 January 2017,"Bronson is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a terrific cast. The highlight of the whole film has to be Tom Hardy, he was really walking on a tightrope with this role, as it all really relies on his performance. Being the only actual character in the whole film, he truly embodies the spirit and soul of Charles Bronson, it is clear he studied the man inside out, gaining a great understanding of how his mind works. I did find it to be far too art-house for my taste, I was hoping for a genuine biography film on Bronson's life, but there is actually very little here about him. People who do not know who this man is will learn nothing from watching this, the whole thing is basically set in his cell as we go inside his mind while he spends the remainder of his years in prison. I was hoping for a movie that would give us a much deeper understanding of Bronson as a man, but it really just messes around for an hour and a half. I was not going in to this expecting to see him dressed as a clown performing a show or rubbing himself in butter. It had a similar tone to A Clockwork Orange, feeling like the director was trying way too hard to be like Stanley Kubrick. A movie that tries a little too hard to be ""out there"" can be saved by a stellar performance, which we got in Hardy, who makes this watchable. Flawed but entertaining, Bronson is not what I expected, but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a good crime film, just do not go out of your way to see it. Follows a man in solitary confinement as he copes with isolation. Best Performance: Tom Hardy",Bronson
15,sol-,Notorious,7,11 March 2017,"Not a biopic of Charles Bronson the actor, but rather Charlie Bronson, once dubbed the UK's most violent prisoner, this drama from Nicolas Winding Refn is not your typical biographical movie. The film is structured around shots of the protagonist on an auditorium stage where he makes those listening to him laugh and cheer at varied anecdotes from his life. He also performs a memorable cabaret act on stage and seems genuinely happy for all his experiences in prison... until it gradually becomes obvious that his audience is merely imagined and a direct result of his megalomania and hyper-elevated sense of self-importance. A chilling point comes early on as Bronson reveals that he saw prison as ""an opportunity"" to make a name for himself and find fame in notoriety; all the prison wardens who he encounters are baffled by his frequently unprovoked violence, but it makes sense for someone bent on achieving fame however possible. We are given precious little background information on Bronson and his upbringing though, like what factors drove him to desire fame, but the snapshot of his life that we do get is absolutely unshakable. Tom Hardy is superb as the charismatic title character subject to near unpredictable mood swings and - as per Refn norm - the film looks and sounds exquisite with vivid colours and a great music score. The very pronounced parallels to 'A Clockwork Orange' work well too, though 'Bronson' is far less concerned with society's reactions to the main character's violence than Kubrick's seminal future-set drama.",Bronson
16,eddie_baggins,"Unlike anything you've ever seen, a Hardy masterclass",8,17 August 2016,"I'm quite positive that Bronson, a cult favourite and star making vehicle for now superstar Tom Hardy, is a film impossible to properly categorise, as one of a kind director Nicolas Winding Refn delivers a biopic of ""Britain's most famous criminal"" in a manner that has never been seen before and unlikely to be seen again and for that, we can be entirely thankful.Bronson is a bizarre, brutal and often brazenly hilarious oddball event that allowed the at the time largely unknown talents of Hardy to shine in a performance that allowed the hulking performer to dominate the large majority of the films scenes with an embodiment of the mentally unhinged criminal Michael Peterson (later known by the moniker Charles Bronson) that goes from face painted entertainer, bare knuckled fighter to nude painter in the space of mere minutes of runtime and it's absolutely one of the modern era's most energetic singular performances.Hardy along with Refn explore Bronson's unhinged psyche and give the audience a first-hand experience into the mind of a man whose great desire was to be famous and be worth something and found the way to achieve these things by becoming a consistent member of various prisons and mental hospitals around the U.K and loved every minute of it.Bronson's the type of film that could've been a dour and seriously toned examination of the man but in the hands of these two talents Bronson is against all the odds an entertaining dark comedy that calls to mind the Australian crime classic Chopper but without question Bronson's greatest asset outside of Hardy's can't look away turn and Refn's inventive direction is the fact it really truly is its own beast, marching to its very unfamiliar beat of the drum.Not for everyone and not exactly easy to determine the truth from falsities, Bronson is a unique treasure of a film thats quintessential viewing for the many fans Hardy now has and the admirers of Refn's up and down works and its likely a lot of viewers of this bizarre tale will be hoping that the pairing up of these two wild minds isn't a one off event.4 hospital dance nights out of 5",Bronson

18,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A complex and disturbing film for a complex and disturbing figure,8,7 April 2017,"Built around a once-in-a-lifetime bravura performance by Tom Hardy, ""Bronson"" boldly attempts to relate the story of a man who can't be understood: Michael Peterson a.k.a. Charlie Bronson – the United Kingdom's most notorious prisoner.""Bronson"" excels on the synchronicity of Hardy and director Nicolas Winding Refn (who also co-writes with Brock Norman Brock). These are two bold, distinctive artists who do not apologize for the abrasiveness of their particular creative leanings. Although a Bronson biopic would look good to most movie-goers on paper, their approach extends well beyond the box. It won't click with viewers who like more traditional storytelling, but their narrative and aesthetic choices are most fitting for a man who prides himself on not being able to be defined by others.The Peterson/Bronson character narrates this story as if giving a theatre monologue. In fact, there are a number of expository scenes that take place in a proscenium theater in which a dapper Bronson ""performs"" for an audience of rich and fancy types. This choice embraces the inherent theatricality of Bronson's behavior and while making the critical point that Bronson had and has a large degree of self-awareness. For a man who has spent most of his life in solitary confinement, it also makes sense that he might imagine his life through this lens of having an audience.The script follows chronological order by and large, but not in any explicit way or by using any clear cues. This echoes the unusual way that time passes – one must imagine – for Bronson. Time was never something he cared about, since he showed little desire to get released, and its passage has only been marked by his violent outbursts and transfers from one prison to the next.The notorious figure and enigma that is Bronson (now apparently named Charles Salvador after his love for Salvador Dali) is the film's focal point. Refn attempts to unlock whatever pieces of Bronson's psyche that he can, but from the angle that he too, like us, knows practically nothing about what makes this man tick. That places the real challenge on the monstrously large shoulders of Hardy. One understands exactly why this film launched Hardy's career, and that if the part had come his way during his rise to fame rather than being its cause, he would've easily been nominated for an Oscar if not the winner.Hardy captures the unpredictable yet in many ways predictable nature of Bronson, the way he is driven and calculated yet subservient to his desire for violence. We know exactly what he's capable of after a few scenes of throwing fists at prison guards, yet it doesn't make understanding why it happens any easier. Hardy magnifies that effect by shouting at times when we don't expect it – like really powerful shouting – and giving the character and his performance tremendous physicality.In a story full of violence and brutality, Refn makes a daring choice to ironically use classical pieces and Golden Age Hollywood- sounding music over many of the most graphic scenes. Yet he also uses electronic music too. Nothing is reminiscent of the time period depicted on screen. This could have easily been a dark, gritty and horrifying film accentuated by dark and gritty music, but the role of violence in Bronson's life is more complicated than ""violence is awful."" Music is a tool that Refn uses to alter our thinking around this person. Without it, we'd just be disturbed and bothered by this animalistic man we don't understand. Refn is giving us the tools to consider this man and his story with different perspectives.""Bronson"" never settles within us or gives us any satisfaction of epiphany. Instead, we are to take great joy in wrestling with this man (not literally, thank goodness) and wrestling with this film. That's a little antithetical to what most movies about an enigmatic figure attempt to do, but given the unbelievable nature of Charlie Bronson, it's fitting that Refn intentionally avoids that style of storytelling and opts for something enigmatic in and of itself.~Steven CThanks for reading!

19,jzappa,Human Behavior Outside Our Capacity To Understand,9,30 April 2010,"In a film experienced flushed with deep red and shot entirely in chronological order, Michael Peterson informs us he was born into a typical bourgeois family. He does not scapegoat his childhood or anything else for what he became, and neither does this film. It sees him as a museum model. No more would we place censure on his childhood than we would judge a preying lion for its actions. At an early age, after seeing Death Wish, young Michael donned the mantle of Charles Bronson. And as Bronson, he has become the U.K.'s best-known prisoner and beyond question its most brutal. With a shaved head and a humorously baroque mustache, he likes to get nude and lubricate himself before going into brawl.His preferred leisure activity is taking a hostage and then plunging into grisly combat with the guards who dash in, beating him into relative passivity with sticks. He has sparked this situation countless times, maybe since he takes so much pleasure in it. Initially sentenced to seven years (""You'll be out in three,"" his mother calls to him in the courtroom), he has now served 34 years, 30 of them in solitary confinement.Why? We don't know. This intensely stylized, beautifully vivid film doesn't know. If Bronson knows, he's not saying. The movie takes on an awe-inspiring Kubrickian grandeur, declining to identify intentions, uninterested in purpose, not even distinguishing causal sequences. It is an hour and a half of frenzy performed by Tom Hardy. This is a flexible actor. As you'd guess, he's made a lot of British gangster movies, however he's also played central roles in Oliver Twist and Wuthering Heights. To his credit, I've seen many of his credited films, but I can't place him in any of those works before Bronson.Hardy brings an unadulterated animalism to the role, surging nude about his cell, bounding from tables, plunging himself into crowds of guards, inconsiderate of impairment or agony. It must hurt him, since it makes us cringe to watch. Yes, for all the film's testosterone appeal, its endlessly beautiful stylistic imagery, its creative and catchy soundtrack, its credibility as that sort of cheeky crime film, it takes one hell of a lot of daring chances with its audience. Director Nicolas Winding Refn did the same with Pusher, but not to this effect.They say one determination of madness is when you do the same thing over and over again without anticipating the same outcome. In that case, Bronson must not be mad. Doing the same thing over and over again, he does not anticipate different outcomes. He goes out of his way to prevent them. During one spell of relative peace, he's allowed to go to the prison art room and work with an instructor. He likes this, I guess. He isn't so terrible at it. When it seems he may be making headway, what does he do? After a fight, he gushes with victory. Does he foresee a round of applause? Most of us, no matter how harmful or beneficial, expect some kind of return for our actions. It may not be some people's concept of benefit, but it's ours. Is Bronson then an extraordinary fetishist, who only wants pain? I'm aware there are masochists like that, though there must be a boundary. What sort of vigorous insanity does one need to want to be clubbed to a pulp for over three decades? I guess, ultimately, Refn and his co-writer Brock Norman Brock were perceptive to avoid any semblance of a rationale. There is some human behavior outside our capacity to understand.",Bronson
20,jtindahouse,Loved it - from a non art house fan,7,14 August 2011,"As huge fan of the current Batman series, and with Tom Hardy being cast as Bane in the upcoming third installment The Dark Knight Rises, Bronson was compulsory viewing for me. I can honestly say if this were not the case this would never have gotten a second look from me at the video store. So I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself rather enjoying this intriguing little art house film.The two keys to this film are Hardy's performance and the direction style by Nicolas Winding Refn. It's hard for me to judge the direction because I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of art house style films. I often find them bizarre and rather distracting from the story line. Or to distract us from the fact that there isn't a story line. This is almost the case here, because the fact is one of the few flaws in the film is a lack of development in the story. Pretty early on we have been given the gist - that Bronson/Peterson is perhaps not all there and likes to fight. The rest of the movie can almost feel a bit like filler as we are given example after example of this. But it's entertaining so we forgive. And i think that that's the key is that because it's entertaining we can forgive any flaws it may have.Which brings us to Hardy. Absolutely astounding performance. If the academy awards were based solely on the best performances of the year, and not a whole bunch of politics, I have no doubt Hardy would have at least received a nomination. He certainly deserved it. The body transformation he did in preparation for the role is the first key to showing he was dead serious about the role. And secondly the complete transformation of him into character, to the point we are even forced to ask 'is that really Hardy?' (à la Heath Ledger in the Dark Knight). Having finally seen Bronson I am now 100% satisfied that the genius Chris Nolan has made another inspired casting decision.As previously stated I didn't go into this film expecting to enjoy it, but I did, so all the more credit to it. I see on the cover of my DVD that it hasn't gone without plenty of critical acclaim which pleases me. It deserves it. The fact that the man the movie focuses on is known rather solely to the English, as I understand it, may be the reason the IMDb rating isn't that high, but the fact it's still 6.8 despite this should show that's it's definitely worth a watch.",Bronson
21,billcr12,Hardy deserved Oscar,8,13 November 2011,"The title refers to the Death Wish actor of the same name which is used by Michael Peterson, Britain's most notorious prisoner. Having spent 30 of his last 34 years in solitary confinement; with good reason, he is absolutely irredeemable.Tom Hardy gives one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen. You will believe he really is the psychopathic real-life man in jail.The style is reminiscent of Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, even using music in similar manner. This is not easy viewing, as the violence and brutality is unrelenting, graphic and frequent. Mr Hardy is also totally nude more than once. The actor is intimidating, menacing, and at times darkly funny.There is no happy ending and this is not a light hearted feature for uplifting the human spirit but it is still well worth your time.",Bronson
22,meeza,Not Hardy to sell!,9,15 August 2010,"As I was watching the first 30 minutes of the bio flick ""Bronson"", I thought it had a death wish or something. It does take a while to let this movie hit you. ""Bronson"" is based on the true story of who is called England's most notorious prisoner, that would be Michael Peterson better known by his alias Charlie Bronson. He has been incarcerated for 36 years, and 31 in solitary confinement. He never killed anyone, just was convicted of armed robbery a few times; but it was his feisty ways in the prisons and psych wards he did time in that got him all that time. Instead of trying to breakout, Bronson wanted to stay in prison but not exactly as a Solitary Man. He relished on physically brutalizing prison guards and other cellmates, not to mention taking a few as hostages. Bronson also had an artistic side that is also highlighted in Writer-Director's Nicolas Winding Refn movie. Refn's screenplay with Brock Norman Brock did escape the rules of viewer engagement from time to time with its extreme bizarreness, but somehow it boldly & bloody worked. Kudos goes to Refn for orchestrating those power-punching scenes where Charlie B. is refn so many up. Also, I must commend his direction of the comedic scenes of observing Charlie readapting to social civilization upon being released after his first ""prison tour of duty"". But ""Bronson"" would not be a brawny feature without the tour-de-performance of Tom Hardy. This Hardy Boy sure did not lack a punch with his dead-ringer Bronson transformation. It will be hard to knock out Hardy as a surefire grand actor for years to come. It is hard to fathom that this is the same actor who played The Cleaner in ""Inception"", two exemplary performances but diverse in so many ways. ""Bronson"" is worth putting in the time for no better reason just to witness Tom Hardy's extraordinaire hard work. So pass Go and matchup with ""Bronson"". ***** Excellent",Bronson
23,estebangonzalez10,A unique biopic,7,7 April 2014,"""You don't want to be trapped inside with me sunshine.""My first Nicolas Winding Refn film was Drive, which I absolutely fell in love with and it quickly became one of my favorite films of all time. I had no prior knowledge of his past work and went into his next film, Only God Forgives, with huge expectations. Despite having a great style and beautiful cinematography, I was really disappointed with the story. Now I've decided to go back and watch some of his past films, starting with Bronson and I must say that I really enjoyed it. Bronson centers on an extremely violent character, and that is one thing I've found in common with these three movies. Refn likes exploring this sort of violent behavior and unsettles the audience with these disturbing scenes. It was something that caught me off guard when I first saw Drive because the first half of the film seemed like it was going to explore the romantic relationship between the two leads, but once the elevator scene takes place it completely changes gears. In Only God Forgives the violence is heavily stylized and there is practically little narrative. Bronson may be a little more similar to Only God Forgives in that you don't get your typical narrative structure in the film, but Refn succeeds in making this a film about a violent character and not just a stylized violent film. The violence we get in Bronson all comes from this one character who the film centers on. It is in his nature to be violent and there is no explanation as to why he behaves this way, we just see him as who he really is. The screenplay co-written by Refn and Norman Brock centers on the true story of one of Britain's most notorious and violent criminals, Michael Paterson (Tom Hardy), who is better known with his alter ego name, Charles Bronson, which he adopted after having seen Death Wish starring that actor. Paterson introduces himself once he's in prison claiming he had a normal childhood. Ever since he can remember he's wanted to be famous so the easiest way to become famous was adopting the life of a criminal. In 1974 at the age of 19 he attempted to rob a post office and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Due to his violent behavior those 7 years turned into 34, and 30 of those he spent in solitary confinement due to his violent behavior. It's during this time that Bronson creates alternate realities celebrating his criminal persona and glorifying his violent behavior in his mind as he enjoys beating the prison guards and sometimes even taking them hostages in his cell.This is Tom Hardy's movie and his physical performance is so impressive that it's simply irresistible. He has all this rage and anger in him and he looks like he can explode in any second on screen. Hardy is one of my favorite actors so when I say that this is his best performance, I'm giving it very high praise. This isn't a violent film, it's a surreal character study of a violent man. In no way is Refn trying to glorify this criminal, he is simply portraying this man as evil without trying to explain how he became this way. He simply is violent and there is no need to try to reason with it. The scenes where Refn takes us into his mind and we see him performing in front of an audience are really impressive, especially that two-faced scene. Refn executes this film perfectly with his usual eccentric scores combining electronic with classical music which fit perfectly the character of Bronson. In the midst of all the dark and violent scenes, Refn also introduces some subtle comedy in the mix. Bronson is a biopic unlike any other and it's hard to resist due to Hardy's furious and mouth foaming performance.",Bronson

26,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Bronson (2008),7,30 December 2011,"The film is both entertaining and disturbing. The most disturbing aspect is that it seems to have no answers, which is also a bit of a hindrance. It tells the story of Charles Bronson, the most expensive and notorious prisoner in Britain's history. He is sentenced to just 7 years for a Post Office robbery, only to end up spending over 30 years in prison for his violent nature. There seems to be no method behind the madness, other than his delusions of grandeur. He sees the world and humans in general as being beneath him. Prison is his home, as he can be larger than life. In such a small world he can easily construct a legend around himself by simply fighting. In many ways it's a tragedy, as we see Bronson has a talent for art, but his anger soon takes over and he throws away any chance of a normal life. Refn takes on quite an artistic style which sets this apart from similar films. Seeing Bronson act out both sides of a conversation with a nurse was both humorous and unsettling. Refn also neither glorifies Bronson's behaviour nor does he condemn it. He appreciates that his audience is smart enough to judge behaviour for ourselves. Hardy gives an incredible performance. He is a ticking time bomb of intensity and cruelty. He shoots from pleasure to pain in the blink of an eye, portraying Bronson as an actual monster, that could easily lure you in with charm before breaking your neck. A fine character portrayal, but those looking for a plot or message may be disappointed.",Bronson
27,framptonhollis,haunting biopic,8,10 February 2017,"""Bronson"" tells the violent and shocking story of Michael Peterson (who nicknamed himself Charles Bronson, after the famous action movie star), who has been hailed as Britain's most infamous and notorious prisoner. This film depiction of his life showcases violence at its most barbaric, completely deglamorizing it to a point of horrific brutality that is at times extremely difficult to watch. One critic hailed this film to the the ""Clockwork Orange"" for the 21st century, which I can certainly agree with. Tonally and stylistically, this film certainly does borrow quite a bit from the Kubrick classic, blending elements of surrealism and humor with terrifying violence and haunting narration from the film's vicious anti hero.While this is a brutal film, it is at times a surprisingly beautiful film. Nicolas Winding Refn is a master of visuals, and the musical score of this film is absolutely superb. Not to mention, Tom Hardy's performance as Bronson is spine chilling, funny, and brilliant!This is a compelling and sickening little movie that will both fascinate and horrify.",Bronson
28,Sergeant_Tibbs,Strange but thoroughly endearing.,7,10 July 2013,"Before their big breakthroughs with the very popular Inception and Drive, actor Tom Hardy and director Nicolas Winding Refn made Bronson, a biopic about the ""most expensive prisoner"" Michael Petersen aka Charles Bronson. Compared to Drive, it's actually quite hilarious while there was little sense of humour there. The amount of violence is just as prevalent and graphic, but the approach to the film is an ironically over-serious way and very self-aware of it's own silliness. Tom Hardy's performance is a forceful and loud one and has a delectable charm. It's a bizarre film. Unfortunately it lacks a lot of structure and is mainly built over a few (albiet chronological) funny/intense situations. While they are effective, it's essentially the same joke - Bronson rejecting authority because he can. It demonstrates the humane limits of punishment before they have to be inhumane.It has been frequently compared to A Clockwork Orange for that theme and it shares a similar use of soundtrack using classical music over violence. It's clear that Refn has a great eye for a soundtrack after it being the most popular aspect of Drive, and there are some electronic tracks used here too that sound similar, specifically New Order's ""Your Silent Face."" The cinematography is mostly excellent here, using grainy minimalistic colour-coded framing that's very reminiscent of European cinema. While it has a great sense of humour, it juxtaposes with its point in a way that only feels like it works some of the time. As a sidenote, it's weird to see Peep Show's Super Hans in a film, especially as his character was the polar opposite.7/10",Bronson
29,tomsview,A Bronson by any other name,8,3 July 2015,"""Bronson"" is an experience. I say experience rather than film, because that is what it is, an experience.I had never heard of this particular Charles Bronson before seeing the film, but it inspired me to do a bit of Googling and I discovered that enough of the guy's life had been left out to make at least two sequels. I also couldn't help noticing that the film didn't show Bronson's propensity for 'glasswork' in many of his rampages.""Bronson"" is violent, but the violence is choreographed, and tempered by humour of the darkest hue. Like many reviewers, ""A Clockwork Orange"" comes to mind; the format is similar, especially as Tom Hardy's Bronson narrates his misadventures in an intimate and cheeky manner much as Malcolm McDowell's Alex does in Kubrick's film, and of course there is the ever-present ultra violence. There are probably influences from a few other sources as well with maybe even a nod to Monty Python, but with that aside, ""Bronson"" can certainly claim to be unique.Humour can cover a multitude of sins, although it probably wouldn't seem all that funny if the real Bronson took a dislike to your face while you were trying to mind your own business in the corner of the exercise yard or you were a warder who happened upon him in his cell on an 'off day'. It's just as well that the film doesn't dwell on the injuries sustained, except the ones Bronson himself suffers.However the film is full of dry humour with some classic lines. The one I particularly liked was when the warder introduces himself after Bronson's aggressiveness lands him in the psychiatric unit devoted to the criminally insane, ""This ain't prison, we're lion tamers here"", he says. That's just before Bronson receives medication that almost turns him into a zombie – a sequence as darkly humorous as when Leo DiCaprio as Jordan Belfort reaches the cerebral palsy phase after taking the bad drugs in ""Wolf of Wall Street"".The humour and cleverness of the script plus an inspired central performance save ""Bronson"" from being just another witless paean to violence – such as a number of the movies starring the original Charles Bronson. It's a film that grabs you by the throat from the beginning, and doesn't release its grip until the final frame.",Bronson
30,intelearts,The Victorian Melodrama Is Alive... But Not That Well,5,20 September 2009,"This reminded us most of Victorian melodrama - unlikely you'd think for a biography of Britain's most violent criminal - but it really is adult pantomime.With use of theatrics and eccentrics it is entertainment but it never reaches that point beyond absurdity that really moves it into being a film of weight rather than substance.Sure, it is surreal and violent, but the comedy isn't comedic enough, and the performance is too much one shade.Others will love this and see the performance as brilliant - for us it lacked all subtlety, and that perhaps is the point, but we were numb after 50 minutes and more so after 90.It is unusual and creative, and has that going for it, but a great film that deserves awards - we don't think so - it is just the Shock of the New factor, bathos at its best (And that's never a good thing) coupled with a performance that is good at its one dimension.I expect to get booed out by the crowd on this one - but we were unmoved and relatively bored by the whole endeavour.",Bronson

I really had no idea what any of them were about, or what they thought about anything.I like the music that was used throughout the film, although I don't know if the music choices were meant to convey anything.I found the insane asylum scenes to be over the top to the point of satire. As some other reviewer's have stated, it seemed like some One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest cosplay.I found the script, the direction and the film's pacing to be a bit strange and aimless.I feel like I just watched an existential commentary on something, but I have no idea what it is.I would say that this film is worth a watch, but you can expect to be confused by the time the film randomly ends and the credits roll.",Bronson
33,ajs-10,"Kind of strange, but kind of compelling at the same time...",7,25 July 2010,"Most people have heard of the actor Charles Bronson, but few have heard of the notorious violent prisoner of the same name. The film is based on the true story of the man who has made his name in the English prison system as the most violent prisoner in Britain. Now, I have heard of Charles Bronson, the prisoner, and so was intrigued to see this film about him.His real name is Michael Peterson; he was born in Luton, just north of London. He didn't have a deprived childhood, he was well loved by his parents but there was obviously something different about this boy. From fighting with other boys he progressed to assaulting his teachers. He eventually grew old enough to be put in prison for holding up a Post Office; his sentence, seven years. Once inside he soon established himself as an extremely dangerous man. As such he was moved around from prison to prison until he eventually ends up in a mental asylum. Here they can keep him drugged but he still finds a way to fight back. Eventually he is declared sane and released. He goes about making a career as a bare knuckle prize fighter, which is where he got his fighting name, Charles Bronson. This, however, is short lived and it's not long before he's back inside again. But this time there are signs he is starting to reform or is there? Up to the release of the film he had spent 34 years in prison, 30 years of which had been in solitary confinement. I'll leave you hanging there; don't want to give too much away.A film that was obviously made on a small budget, but one that is quite entertaining in a strange and bizarre way. The story is told from Bronson's point of view and as such has a bit of an art house feel about it in places. There's a pretty good soundtrack with a few songs the audience might recognise. A real power-house performance from Tom Hardy as Charles Bronson/Michael Peterson. I must also give an honourable mention to Matt King who played Paul.As I've already said, the film has an art house feel to it, lots of very short pieces put together in places, but then longer scenes that give more narrative. It's a very interesting film to watch, always interesting, partly because the character of Bronson is so unpredictable. Thanks to the great performance of Tom Hardy and thanks to a great script. At times it is very violent and the language is very strong in places. Over all, it's kind of bizarre, but I must say, recommended.My score: 7.4/10",Bronson
34,manitobaman81,Good,7,22 August 2014,"Here you will find a bit of realism existing in a delusional world. It is a powerful film, but I doubt I will ever want to watch it again. A young man who was sentenced to seven years in prison for robbing a post office ends up spending three decades in solitary confinement. During this time, his own personality is supplanted by his alter-ego, Charles Bronson. This movie is dark, intense and most of all depressing. We know from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. I found the film a little too dark and a little too slow as it moves to what seems like an inevitable bitter end. I award it a rating of 7 out of 10.",Bronson
35,AhmedSpielberg99,This is definitely a one-of-a-kind character study!,6,21 March 2019,"Although our psychopathic protagonist narrates some of his own stories to the audience, he doesn't give any sort of an explanation to his deranged behavior and acts of violence., thus Refn assures us that the aim of his movie is not to provide us with the titular lunatic criminal's clear motives or even causes; but rather to tell us that humans can act in a most barbarous way with no reason, or at least with a reason we can't grasp at all.Nicolas Winding Refn explored Bronson's baffling psyche through art, many sorts of art one of them is Tom Hardy's monumental acting abilities and tremendous range. I've always been a fan of this massively talented and charismatic British actor, and this is undisputedly one of his finest performances in his career, so far.Sadly, I was never constantly invested in the movie. Honestly, the movie almost lost me completely after the first 25-30 minutes. Nevertheless, I found some moments to be highly entertaining and quite engaging; but that was only sporadically. I think Refn could have explored, or rather made us explore, Bronson in more aspects and with more creativity, which Refn, apparently, has no shortage of. Instead, 95% of Refn's artistry is at the very beginning and very the end. The remaining 5% could have been gone unnoticed if it wasn't for Hardy's mind-blowing performance.(6.5/10)",Bronson

Great leading acting, pretty awful movie in truth, with a highly stylised presentation that doesn't work at all (and that borrows from 'A Clockwork Orange' in the process); all that Bronson really has going for it is a brave and powerful performance from Tom Hardy. In the second half of the film you are going to get awful sick of seeing his nudge, nudge, wink, wink. Put it away, Tom.Don't think I'd go and see a film at the cinema which features a mental patient pooing into his own hand (before eating it), constant violence, and no real point except to portray the real-life Mr Charles as some sort of anti-hero; something so off the mark I was just shaking my head most of the time. Lots of characters not introduced properly, no real story and a moment of black humour or two. That's about it.If you want to see a powerful prison drama with a good story go watch McVicar instead, an oldie but way better than this.",Bronson
37,JohnRayPeterson,Another outstanding performance by Tom Hardy,7,28 January 2012,"The movie is based on a real life person, no not Charles Bronson, but one who thought of himself as Charles Bronson. Don't look for storytelling greatness or original idea in a usual sense, but rather look at this project as a unique display of style. It's all about caricaturing an exceptional individual, the infamous Michael Peterson; he was the most notorious prisoner Britain has ever known. I watched this movie, not quite believing what I was seeing and wondering how weirder it could get. I did not know what to make of it, yet I could not turn it off. I understood early on that this was the life story of an incredible criminal, but incredible not in a flattering way.The director found an approach that could stand out, really stand out, and also found in Tom Hardy the best actor to play this part. I did not recognize Hardy until I looked up the credits. It's the same Tom Hardy that I raved about in a review of the movie 'Warrior' and who I liked in 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', 'Inception', 'RocknRolla', 'Sucker Punch' (not the 2011 one, the 2008), and 'Layer Cake'. The movie will not likely appeal to you if you're not open to 'artsy' movie making, but if you want to see a great performance by Hardy, you can't go wrong. You'll never see a tough-guy character like this; he's the 'baddest s.o.b.' I've ever seen. It was an experience.",Bronson
38,joachimokeefe,A good movie about a very bad human being,7,21 March 2014,"A loose, stylish biopic of Michael Peterson aka Charles Bronson, now (2014) 62, who is styled by himself and whoever needs to write about him as 'Britain's most violent prisoner'. Bronson's trouble is that battering people is all he's any good at. Failed robber, failed murderer, and failed human being, to be frank, but there's nothing either the UK's prison or mental health system can do for him. That doesn't make him any sort of campaigner, by the way, though he can lift a snooker table with one arm (not shown in movie). Nor is he Britain's worst cartoonist.If you are going to make a film about someone who's spent 30 out of 34 years in solitary simply because he can't control his sadistic impulses, 'Bronson' is certainly a smart, slick, entertaining piece of work with some stylistic nods to Clockwork Orange, etc. And Tom Hardy - who is not circumcised, you may or may not wish to know - knocks it out of the park. Without his performance this would probably not be worth seeing.'Bronson' is a pop-culture validation of the man's pathological narcissism, not an attempt to analyse him, which makes it somewhat shallow; but as shallow entertainment it certainly delivers. It's a shame 'The Krays', the story of a more interesting pair of thugs, wasn't this well put together.",Bronson

40,christophe92300,Seems pointless,5,6 May 2013,"Bronson, it's first and foremost an exceptional performance by Tom Hardy who single-handedly carried the movie. It's also Winding Refn and his irreproachable ultra refined aesthetics.But a movie is also a script, a story, and obviously this is where the problem lies. Indeed, the Danish throws at your face a raw, contemplative chronicle of the violence driving this character, which you don't get the point. Ultimately, was there enough material for a movie ? It is strongly doubtful.The most absurd is the risible comparison some are able to make between Bronson and A Clockwork Orange: Kubrick's movie was absolutely visionary, offered a point of view and brought up a true reflection, all the opposite of Bronson which boils down to a pile-up of violent scenes you rapidly tire of.",Bronson
41,beresfordjd,Hardy is awesome but I hate this movie,7,3 April 2011,"I hate this film - it says nothing. It tells you little about the protagonist and is an exercise in pretentiousness. There appears to be nothing to know about Bronson's motivation for his bizarre choices. We are no more clear about whether he is actually insane or not. We suppose he must be because surely anyone who behaves the way he did and does must be insane. I come to Tom Hardy having seen him in Inception, having read about how good he is in this film. He was good in Inception but he is exceptional in this - I do not believe that anyone else could have portrayed Bronson in quite the way Hardy does. It seems odd that he did not receive an Oscar for this as it is truly a tour de force, whether the movie works overall or not. I think a more conventional approach to the story telling may have garnered him the proper acclaim he should have had. It is an uncomfortable watch for the viewer because one wants to know who Bronson is and all one comes away with is a frustrating portrait of a total enigma.",Bronson

It's only a 7/10 because I would have liked to have seen longer fighting scenes and maybe more on his life before prison. I also think the director tried to be too clever at times.But overall It's a very good watch and if you know about Bronson then it's a must watch.",Bronson

Based on the unbelievable true story and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, the at times bizarre film tells the story of Michael Peterson, played by Hardy, who robs a post office in 1974, to only get 26 pounds out of the deal, and is sentenced to four years in prison. A four year stay has turned into a thirty-four year prison term, thirty of which has been spent in solitary confinement.The man, which the British press calls 'the most violent prisoner in Britain,"" is one of the most complex, and highly disturbing characters to be depicted on screen this year. He always wanted to famous, Hardy states with such charisma at the opening of the film, but he can't sing, he can't dance, so he creates an alter ego during his time as a boxer prior to his prison sentence. Though the film is loosely based on the real man and his story, it doesn't matter, Refn treats the film with such artistic integrity and takes chances that most directors hope to accomplish in their careers. The narrative, though over-whelming at times, is unyielding in the manner in which it's told. For the most part however, Tom Hardy's gritty and aggressive performance will go down as one of the best kept secrets of 2009.In watching the picture, the co-stars are nearly invisible as Hardy takes control of the screen and your attention. He enables the viewer to devote their time and energy with fear of severe consequences in not doing so. Hardy is an incredible talent and not sure if you'll see a more devoted actor to a character on film this year.Refn's choice of music that fills the scenes with torment, discomfort, and sheer violence is a brilliance shown in his armor. Bronson is pure entertainment, and though it doesn't provide any moral or social significance in the acts of our lives, it's an admiral effort by British cinema.***/****",Bronson

It's disturbing, and recalls Rupert Pupkin in 'The King Of Comedy' and Jonathan Pryce channeling Grock the clown in Trevor Griffiths' play 'Comedians'. Also, Freddie Starr in the infamous 2001 Channel 4 documentary 'Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster', in which Starr berated an empty auditorium and laid a wreath on-stage to symbolise 'British comedy's passing'.Starr came across as desperately unhappy, but also largely self-deluding. Bronson is equally deluded and naive. A prison governor tells him, ""You're ridiculous"". He is. But really, he's just a little boy incarcerated inside endlessly replicating walls of muscle, a self-made prison of gristle and bone.Hardy gets that, and his performance is astonishing; proper Stanislavski. Whether gazing into the distance with a thousand-yard stare, as if awaiting the muse of mayhem to tell him who to hit next, or gleefully cavorting in the theater of Bronson's imagination, the man's magnetic. 'Peep Show's' Matt King also lends sterling support as Bronson's comically seedy, upper-class boxing promoter Paul; a Withnail in the underworld sporting black leather gloves.In a movie filled with startling, near-hallucinatory moments - drugged, drooling asylum inmates dancing woozily to The Pet Shop Boys; Bronson caged in a tiny, medieval-like restricting device, like something from a Francis Bacon - there is a truly remarkable scene toward the end that attempts to throw speculative light on the man's motivations, what really makes him tick.

47,moviemanMA,Journey into aggression,8,8 October 2009,"Bronson is the dramatized story of Charlie Bronson. Not the actor from Death Wish, The Great Escape, and The Dirty Dozen. This is the story of England's most violent prisoner. Born Michael Peterson, he quickly realized that he wanted to make a name for himself. It is unclear why he chose the path he did. He had a normal upbringing, a nice home, good parents, yet he just liked to fight. And he was good at it.After robbing a post office for what can be only described as ""chump change,"" he was given a seven year sentence. Since that sentencing in 1974, Bronson has seen a little over a few months as a free man. He is still in prison to this day.What Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn gives us is a stylized version of one of the most bizarre and intoxicating stories I've seen in a long time. Bronson, played wonderfully by Tom Hardy, loves what he does. At least that what he wants us to believe. I was never really convinced that Bronson truly enjoyed what he did. Then again, I can't see the pleasure in pummeling prison guards, bare knuckle fighting, fighting dogs, and bringing others close to death. That said, it was something else to watch.Hardy gives a rock solid performance. He fits the part both physically and mentally. He has the right edge to let us know how intelligent and hostile Charlie Bronson can be. It's hard to imagine playing someone as energized and mentally perturbed as Bronson, who gets his jollies from beating up innocent prison guards and inmates, but Hardy does just that in style. He never falters and gives 100 percent in every scene.I can see a lot of similarities to A Clockwork Orange. It has similar accents, violent images, an insight into the criminal mind. Things very much associated with Kubrick's masterpiece. Still, Bronson offers something different. It's more theatrical, blending both the real world with a more dramatic and exaggerated story, showing Bronson as a prisoner, a performer, and storyteller.Bronson is filled with stunning, startling images and a gives us a very original story, the likes of with we have seldom seen or will see. Charlie Bronson is a unique case of a man that nobody will ever truly understand. Whether you like the glorification of criminals or not, it's hard to deny that this film and the people involved doesn't offer great entertainment. I expect more from Hardy and Refn.",Bronson
48,Cinemaniac1984,"It's not for everyone, but you cannot deny that this is a tour de force for Tom Hardy.",8,4 December 2015,"Bronson is certainly a movie that is not for everyone, particularly young children and those that are easily unsettled. It's not an easy movie to watch but without a doubt I was left mesmerised by Tom Hardy's performance. Tom Hardy alone had me hooked throughout the movie, and it's no surprise that Bronson garnered Tom Hardy worldwide acclaim and made him a household name with roles in such movies as Inception (2010), Warrior (2011), The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015).Based on a true story, Bronson tells the tale of a young hot headed criminal Michael Peterson (Tom Hardy) who robbed a post office and was later arrested and sentenced to 7 years prison. During his time in prison, Michael Peterson became widely notorious as a volatile, hulking and unmanageable prisoner involved in numerous fights, assaults, and hostage incidents with guards and inmates whilst in prison and would later spend most of his adult life in solitary confinement. As well as earning himself a well known reputation as UK's most dangerous prisoner, Michael Peterson sheds his previous identity and later adopts the name Charlie Bronson named after the famous actor. Charlie Bronson also gains a notorious reputation while participating in numerous bouts of bare knuckle boxing in which his opponents are mercilessly punished. Bronson is later released from prison but promptly finds himself back behind bars and he realises that he is more comfortable in prison and gets used to the fact that he will spend the rest of his life behind bars.The film is twisted, violent and darkly humorous. You can't help be horrified by some scenes yet find there is a touch of humour throughout the movie. Without question this is a tour de force for Tom Hardy who also transformed himself into a hulking Charlie Bronson by gaining 42 pounds (19kg) of muscle which Tom Hardy has since maintained for most of his later career. It's a shame Tom Hardy was not recognised for any awards but the critical acclaim that he received for Bronson was well deserved.Bronson is certainly not a movie not for everyone, but definitely a must see for all Tom Hardy fans or if you like your movies darkly humorous on the violent side.8/10.",Bronson

The fact alone that Bronson actually enjoyed the movie and said that nobody other than Tom Hardy could play him any better, he even went as far to shave off his mostache and send it to Hardy whom wore it in the actual movie, that alone is remarkable. If the man the movie is based on thought it was good then thats gotta be a good of a reason as any and what an entertaining watch it was, i really liked how they executed this story, i couldn't agree anymore that Hardy was ultimately the perfect candidate for this, i think its great how he can change so much about himself for a role something that is really inspiring.This is a title that i highly recommend, it was definitely worth every second, you won't be dissappointed in the slightest. Lets be honest has Tom Hardy ever been in a bad movie? I rest my case, enjoy the film!",Bronson
51,peefyn,Violence as a character trait rather than audience bait,8,20 September 2016,"Bronson is a very interesting movie. It presents you with a character that seems to have a violence inherit in him, and a total disregard for authority, and does so in a way that make you understand him, despite the huge gap there is between his world and your own. You can see how the system he is a part of does not have a way of dealing with him. And you can also see how his motivations are not evil, no matter how much harm he has caused.I have little knowledge about the actual person this movie is based on, and my opinion on the character in the movie is not meant to be taken as a comment on him. I have no idea if the real life ""Bronson"" deserved the sympathy granted in him in this movie, but it does make for a very interesting picture.In addition to crafting this character, Refn also comments upon us an audience, as the character is multiple times addressing us directly (even with us represented on screen), and it adds a layer of exposing not only how Bronson appears, but how he chooses to represent himself.This reflected use of both violence and character makes the movie more than worth watching. When you on top of that get some great performances and a good soundtrack, you end up with a very good movie.",Bronson

Whilst aesthetically the movie is stunning, the story is something to be desired. It's not a bad story, in fact it is quite entertaining, but nothing is really told or shown. It's by no way repetitive, but you feel as if the momentum is stuck in second gear, trying to shock you through its gratuitous violence, but leaving a deep character study in the lurch. Bronson sets out to do what Michael Peterson (Chatles Bronson), does best; that is get nice and dirty. It's a stunningly beautiful film that never lacks depth in the shot, but fails to give you any care about any of the characters.

56,nesfilmreviews,Tom Hardy's volcanic performance makes this bio utterly compelling.,8,4 July 2013,"One thing is for certain: Bronson invites you to admire its protagonist as a pure, muscular embodiment of anarchy. And perhaps you will, but you will also be glad that he is still behind bars. The film opens with a man on stage proclaiming, ""My name is Charlie Bronson, and all my life I've wanted to be famous."" The auditorium appears to be empty, but later, a still unseen audience provides the approval he so desperately covets. Born Michael Peterson (Tom Hardy), in a British suburb in 1952, he first went to prison at the age of 22 for burglarizing a post office. He stole £26.18 and received seven years for the crime, but that sentence was quickly extended as Peterson's infractions inside began to pile up: insubordination, violence, blackmail, and multiple hostage situations. Michael is gradually swallowed up by the prison system, seemingly an environment that suits him best. It is during this time that Michael Petersen, the boy, fades, and 'Charles Bronson,' his superstar alter ego, takes over. Bronson occupies any territory in which he exists by sheer, brute, force. Bronson's first and only instinct is to fight, to capture, and to win. He never makes it to phase two of planning. He has now spent more than three decades in jail, with the majority of those years in solitary confinement, and has become a tabloid sensation as the ""most violent prisoner in Britain."" The film is impressively structured and edited, shot in dark tones--illustrating his theme that Bronson is ""an artist looking for a canvas,"" whose search is frequently violent, crazy, and erratic. The director is Nicolas Winding Refn, most famous for the movie ""Drive"" (2011), and his ""Pusher"" trilogy of films about Copenhagen's violent, multi-ethnic underworld. Refn himself is something of a rebel, who brings a sharp, surreal, foreign eye to the film. The film solely rests upon the astonishing performance from an almost unrecognizable Tom Hardy. Bronson never asks for our sympathy for his situation, but somehow, at times, he is able to do just that. Hardy brings a raw physicality to the role, leaping naked about his cell, jumping from tables, and hurling himself into half a dozen guards. Unfortunately, the film never gets under the skin of Bronson and his motivations. It omits other facets of his life including the Muslim woman he married in jail, his conversion to Islam, and the subsequent renouncement of the awards he won for his art and poetry.Enduring the egotistical ramblings of a psychopath may not sound like a particularly entertaining prospect, but ""Bronson"" delivers on all fronts. Gripping, visceral, ugly, and beautiful, ""Bronson"" is simply unforgettable.",Bronson
57,gregking4,A confronting pile driver of a film!,7,27 August 2009,"This film about Charles Bronson, the self-proclaimed ""most dangerous prisoner in Britain,"" is not your conventional biopic. Bronson has been in prison for the past 34 years, the majority of that time spent in solitary confinement. Born Michael Petersen he changed his name in prison as an homage to the tough guy movie actor and star of films like Death Wish. But he constantly feels the need to challenge the authority of the prison guards and repeatedly butts heads with them in gruelling showdowns. At first Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn (the Pusher trilogy, etc) declined the offer to direct the film, not wanting to make another film about a violent man, but he relented because he needed to finance his next film project. As anyone who has seen his powerful crime thrillers would know, Refn doesn't pull any punches, and Bronson is quite draining at times. However his direction is tight and stylish. Refn frames the film around the imaginary device of Bronson addressing an appreciative theatre audience, bragging about his accomplishments. The driving force behind Bronson though is the film's star Tom Hardy, who does an extraordinary job with a physically demanding role. Although an ugly, intimidating and repellent character, Hardy's performance is so mesmerising that you can't look away. A confronting pile driver of a film!",Bronson
58,Tcarts76,The Ghost of Kubrick is alive and well,10,25 November 2012,"""Bronson,"" is based on the true story of a notorious UK prisoner, Michael Peterson (Tom Hardy),who after originally being sentenced to 7 years for robbing a post office, ended up spending almost 30 years in solitary confinement. He eventually took on his alter ego, Charlie Bronson, after being told his own name just didn't sound tough enough.The Good: I love this movie. If I didn't know Stanley Kubrick was dead, I would have not wasted a second thinking anyone else crafted this movie. Nicolas Winding Refn, certainly channeled his ghost in creating this film. Kubrick is a great man to imitate, but I really don't think anyone has come this close in imitation. Throwing away the flamboyant mod feel but keeping the sort of aloof violent sense of humor of ""A Clockwork Orange,"" these 2 movies could easily be combined for a great evening of entertainment without missing a beat.Tom Hardy is absolutely stunning in this role, which I feel would be very hard for anyone to pull off. It is a role that requires overacting but overacting in a very stylized way. I am becoming a big Tom Hardy fan.The Bad: The bad is probably just that this is a British film directed by a Dane, and therefore not as many people would get to see it. This is a brilliant masterpiece. Usually I might say that a movie that looks and feels so much like a copy of another Director's work is lazy, superficial, and a short cut, but this is a rare case where the sun, moon, and stars just seemed perfectly aligned.I give it 10 out of 10.

59,son_of_cheese_messiah,Impressive but tries too hard,7,24 December 2011,"This film has much to recommend it and its reputation will probably go up in time as more people see it. It looks fantastic and the performance by Tom Hardy is compelling. There is no attempt to sentimentalise this character or depict him as a victim. The dialogue is taut and authentic and contains many lines which may, in time, become as familiar as those in say Get Carter. My favourite is ""you just p***ed on a gypsy in the middle of nowhere. Its hardly the hot ticket."" My slight problem is that the film sometimes tries too hard to impress. This is most noticeable during the long (literally) operatic scenes. These scenes become especially prevalent towards the end, when Wagnerian music accompanies Bronson's drawings (with an ill-fitting cartoon sequence) and the warden slow-mo strolling down the corridor. I did not see what the music added here. In the violent climax, the music actually detracted from the physicality of the scene.",Bronson

It's harder to play a clown than to play this kind of drooling idiot. Well, you can't fool me. That's not ""acting"", it's just ""acting out"".Bonus (negative) points: the movie is extremely boring.

61,colinrgeorge,"""Bronson""",6,6 April 2010,"Can you really produce a biopic about the theatrical brutality of Britain's most dangerous prisoner and not incite comparisons to Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange?"" The trailer for Nicholas Winding Refn's ""Bronson"" spouts the likeness triumphantly with a quote attributed to Damien McSorley for the publication, ""Zoo."" Surely Kubrick is a flattering filmmaker to have your humble work compared to, though like American director Wes Anderson, who borrows all the style of the man but none of the content, ""Bronson"" is a film with an air of grandiosity and very little in the way of actual story. Kubrick's film, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, has a Dickensian plot that doubles back on characters and scenarios established in the first act, leaving nothing unchanged by the end of the third. It's a comparison under which ""Bronson"" unfavorably suffers: well directed, impeccably performed, but completely devoid of structure.I don't mean to undersell the above compliments, however. Tom Hardy as lowly criminal Michael Peterson and his imprisoned superstar alter ego Charles Bronson, displays a remarkable, feral intensity in the role, spitting meaty, cockney chunks of dialogue with a truly disquieting voracity. And Hardy makes a perfect match for Refn: both share a larger- than-life approach to their craft. The director's visual audacity is never more sublimely paired with Hardy's performance than during Bronson's intermittent narrations; snippets of a surreal one-man stage show for some great, unseen audience. The cutaways recall the feel of Alex's presentation following the successful administration of the ludovico technique in ""Clockwork Orange."" Swooping crane and sweeping dolly shots, along with some fantastic locations, also evoke Kubrick's directorial sentiments, as does the more obvious accompaniment of classical score to key sequences.Unfortunately, the failure of ""Bronson"" is not only that there's very little dramatically to be done with a man who spends the better part of his life in solitary confinement, but that beyond a vague notoriety, Peterson's ultimate goal is never particularly clear. The ending of the film is startling in its abruptness given that the scene seems interchangeable with any number of the fights Bronson picks over the course of the film. It doesn't feel a particularly epic brawl, and by that point, the tedium of Bronson's outbursts, battles, and increasingly severe punishments had worn me (though it could maybe be called a statement on the nature of desensitizing cinema--in that respect a reverse ""Clockwork Orange"") into a sleepy passivity.The film is nevertheless a step the right direction for the usually-schlocky and hyper- masculine Refn, but ""Bronson"" still wants for the substantiality that makes great films great films. It isn't likely to inspire any further meditation on its subject beyond perhaps provoking a curiosity about the man himself in those intrigued but unsatisfied with the screenplay's frugal allocation of hard data and social context. But despite the film's inability to make clear its greater thematic intent, I don't think ""Bronson"" is a perversely violent film or that it exists solely as a fetishistic idol to counterculture, as some will likely label it, and have labeled Kubrick's masterpiece. Its beautiful cinematography (courtesy Larry Smith, interestingly enough, the lighting cameraman for Kubick's own ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and stellar lead may make it a worthwhile rental next year, but as it stands, ""Bronson"" is a precautionary tale. It's a film that has everything going for it except the the thing that matters most: its story. And you don't need to be Stanley Kubrick to figure that out.",Bronson
62,Der_Schnibbler,Not really worth it,2,10 July 2009,"The best way to describe this movie would be pseudo-artsy crapola of ""Natural Born Killers"" meets the social critique (albeit nowhere near as successful) of ""A Clockwork Orange"" meets the nonsensical, limp irrelevancy of ""The Big Lebowski."" The movie is shot in that dumb style some directors seem to think is ""artsy,"" with random shots, stilted dialog, stupid ""jokes,"" all interspersed with the main character speaking to an imaginary audience and acting like a very unfunny clown. I suppose the director thought this was going to be ""deep."" If you are expecting a halfway coherent movie where you see the ""story of the life"" of this guy, forget it.To make matters more annoying, even during the few parts of the film where we approach something vaguely resembling a logical narrative, the actor is still walking around talking like an idiot pothead, with stupidly exaggerated pronunciation of EVERYTHING he says, almost like he's retarded.It's a nice effort, I wouldn't call it worthless, but it's only for people who appreciate weird films. Everyone else will find it dull and dready.",Bronson
63,jonerogers,Brutal throughout,10,29 December 2018,"So here we have in my eyes the best performance of Tom Hardy's career to date. I have always loved him as an actor and the many films and TV adaptations he shines and gives 100% to everything.This film is based on a true story about a man born Michael Peterson who went on to change his name twice but known mainly for being Charles Bronson. He was arrested in 1974 for robbing a post office and getting just £26. He was tried, convicted and sent to prison for 7 years which would have ended up just 4 on good behaviour. This one crime some 44 years ago ended with a catalogue of crimes within the various prisons and he is still in prison now.This one man band of out of control aggression is rarely tamed and he is in a cycle of continuous failure.Tom Hardy plays this role in frightening style and from start to finish had me glued to the screen. He tells the story upon a stage and we follow him through the journey of what most would see as pure hell.The film itself is powerful enough to bring all your emotions to the surface, I felt so sad for the real life prisoner, so cruel is fate to inflict this upon him. I kinda felt so angry that our justice system is failing this man so much. Tom Hardy is the main actor and to be honest anyone else in the film remain insignificant and unnoticeable in their roles.Not for the faint hearted but not to be missed as this true story is brutally told with a Stellar performance from Mr. Hardy",Bronson
64,EasternZZ,Tom Hardy shines!,10,19 October 2018,"Tom Hardy is great in this movie. His acting is amazing. He can be evil and menacing in one second, then funny and dramatic in the next.

66,SeriousJest,A Masterful Performance Led by Hardy,6,10 December 2013,"A creative, artistic, and interesting way to tell Bronson's story. The soundtrack and camera work very-appropriately compliment the tone and pace of the film.I am not that interested in the movie's subject matter, as Bronson appears to be a truly ridiculous manchild who perhaps could have found a better place in this world (and maybe even more happiness) as an MMA fighter or military man, were it not for a willfully uncontrolled mean streak (not a lack of discipline, though, as he seems to be able to focus and dedicate his energies to what he actually sets his sights upon). So, in that sense, the film leaves me annoyed at its protagonistbut never bored. This flick is like the first half of A Clockwork Orange, but without the rape.Also, I am even more convinced that Hardy is one of the best actors of our time. His performance is nothing short of masterful. According to IMDb, Refn was not allowed to meet Bronson in person since Refn is not from Britain, but was allowed to have two phone calls with him. Hardy, however, met with Bronson several times, and the two became good friends (although another IMDb post says they only met on two occasions). Bronson was impressed with how Hardy managed to get just as muscular as he was and how well he could mimic his own personality and voice. Bronson has stated that he believes Hardy was the only person who could play him.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",Bronson

He is arrested for stealing and due to his rambunctious nature, he tends to spend a lot of time alone. Upon his release, he takes up bare fisted boxing at the suggestion of a man he met in jail. He needs a fighting name, so he chose Charles Bronson because it is a name people associate with vengeance. The main actor is amazing!!! He has many monologues and pulls you in with his insanity. The real Bronson is still incarcerated and has written a few books. He is in great physical shape, so he wrote one about how he keeps in shape in prison. He seems a bit split personality and he switched between them with ease. When the movie ended, I wanted more, so I went on line to learn more. This is truly an entertaining movie and I'm glad I was made aware of it.",Bronson
69,Maladjusted_1,An unhelpful biopic which suffers from a lack of substance.,5,26 April 2016,"A film can be good in spite of a bad performance, but a good performance rarely provides enough compensation in an otherwise weak film. 'Bronson' claims to follow the title character through his years of crime and incarceration in Britain, but it is more accurately described by Roger Ebert: ""92 minutes of rage, acted by Tom Hardy."" As you may expect from this brief but accurate description, the film features its fair share of fights. Interestingly, these are usually captured in close resemblance to 'A Clockwork Orange'. This may have been intentional, as both films can be interpreted as satires of the justice system, told from the perspective of a particularly troublesome offender. Unfortunately, the similarities end there. Although the protagonist of Nicolas Refn's 'Bronson' is a man both real and living, he is profoundly uninteresting. The novelty of Tom Hardy screaming expletives soon wears off, and there is very little substance lying beneath the character's violent exterior. A higher standard of writing could have made Charles Bronson an interesting subject for a biopic, but the inability of Refn's film to confront the man seriously means that the viewer learns almost nothing about Charles Bronson in watching the film. 'Bronson' could have explored the ethics and psychological impact of solitary confinement, the public fascination with figures like Charles Bronson, and what the aims are (and should be) of long-term imprisonment. It doesn't. I can only recommend this film to die- hard fans of Tom Hardy, although I don't believe that this is (as many believe) his best performance. He's better in 'Locke', I think.",Bronson
70,velvoofell,A Sense Of The Long Good Rocky Chopper Shrek,10,19 February 2009,"'Bronson' is a ninety minute dramatised account of the life of one of Britain's most notorious prisoners, Michael ""Charlie Bronson"" Petersen. Originally jailed for armed robbery in the seventies, Bronson's refusal to button down to porridge - and ambition to become a ""name"" in prison, saw him take hostages, stage protests and fight many prison guards at a time. His resultant extended sentence of a staggering thirty four years of prison have seen him spend twenty six years in solitary confinement, a spell in an insane asylum and a total of one hundred and twenty four days of parole/freedom. With each small burst of freedom on the outside, Bronson realised he was ill suited to a world fast outpacing him - he is a king and a legend in prison, however and one of the strong messages of the film is that he would rather suffer the slings and arrows of jail than operate in a world he could not fathom.Bronson, in an awards-magnetising, all consuming performance from 'Star Trek: Nemesis's Tom Hardy, narrates his own life story from a Proscenium stage. Bronson's innate comedic and artistic talents are exploited in these linking scenes. He wears Leigh-Bowery style clown make-up as he addresses the audience - in fact Leigh Bowery's influence seems a touchstone for the atavistic ""war paint"" Bronson adopts during various staged battles with his jailers, as well as his own surrealist cartoons.A pastiche of an act popularised by slightly nihilistic British comedian ""Freddy Starr"" is used inspirationally in Bronson's description of his dealings with an asylum's governors.All in all, this is a rich, highly stylish and convincing account of an empty life and aching soul. Vertigo Pictures appear not to have had a distributor for the film at the screening this writer attended and it would be a shame if a major international distributor trimmed the violence, homo-erotic subtexts and surrealism as it would neuter the piece.In a film that is 'A Sense of Freedom', with the period tone and raw power, but profound Britishness, of 'The Long, Good Friday' - plus a dash of 'The Rocky Horror Show' and 'Shrek' - an anti-hero as impressive as Eric Bana's 'Chopper' (2000) is born.Although, unlike his Antipodean doppelganger, Bronson don't hit women. A refreshingly different British crime movie. You won't have enough...",Bronson
71,padiyark,Awesome Independent flick about one of Britain's most notorious prisoners,9,26 August 2013,"Being a non-Brit, I had seen this on Netflix as a recommendation, and as Tom Hardy was in it and directed by Nicholas Refn, I had to check it out.I was definitely not disappointed. First, this is Tom Hardy's vehicle, and he chews up every scene to the max, while relishing the subtleties of the role. He plays Bronson as a violent simpleton; a relatively nice bloke, but always raring for a fight for petty reasons; along the way, his portrayal of Bronson is one where the character is expresses himself as a (literal) fighter, despite trying other outlets. Some of the scenes are hilarious and thoroughly off the wall.I highly recommend the film for anyone who wants a film that is totally off the wall, while maintaining a sense of humor. While it would be easy to compare to ""Fight Club"", this tends to stick with a more realistic scenario, while still managing to entertain.",Bronson

This movie lacks the acting, cleverness, depth, and themes that made A Clockwork Orange one of the greatest motion pictures ever made IMO.This movie does have a pretty decent performance from the lead character but suffers from poor writing and a lot of unneeded scenes that add nothing to the film.I really feel like I know nothing more about what made Bronson ""tick"" after seeing the movie despite his monologues.The movie does make strong commentaries about prison systems and justice but it does nothing to make it a memorable experience.I gave the movie a 4 out of 10.

80,maatmouse-1,Tom Hardy in violent biopic of British offender,6,8 October 2009,"I have heard much about this film and am surprised, initially, that it was made. It certainly wouldn't have been made a few years ago.Tom Hardy stars as this pumped up and extremely violent real-life British criminal whose story seems to baffle the psychologists trying to work WHY this man was violent. Let's face it, he doesn't come from the classic favourite background of the social worker: the broken home. His parents are portrayed as pleasant, hard-working folk. There is no sign of parental abuse or mistreatment and there are no siblings to rage against. In short, the entity which eventually became Charles Bronson: notorious prisoner was brought up in as pleasant an image of family life as was possible in the 1950s and 1960s. The film portrays him as violent and abusive towards his teacher, at one point, throwing a desk at him. What the film (and possibly non-English audiences) won't show you is that a lot of British schools were like this, yet with the teachers more willing to inflict physical punishment than perhaps this film reveals. Then on, it is a fairly typical wander into this man's life. He is shown falling in love and then marrying. Later on, he is shown having robbed a post office and ending up in prison. Prison is a very brutalising experience for him, but he survives nevertheless, spending long periods in solitary confinement after episodes of fighting against prison guards. All this is shown against a backdrop of Wagner opera intermingled with the Pet Shop Boys! Bronson acts as the well-dressed narrator of his turbulent life for a crowd of the well-to-do in an grimy theatre which might well have come out of The Shining or a Clockwork Orange. Amidst all of this are attempts by the Establishment to pigeon-hole Bronson. He seems to do alright in jail, partly because there is a routine and the opportunity to vent pent-up anger. At one point he is farmed out to Rampton mental facility where he is imprisoned and injected with powerful drugs to curb violent, antisocial tendencies. All this is directed with more than a potent nod to Kubrick, although Refn's vision is a lot less colourful and more washed out than Kubrick's. You can actually almost 'feel' the grimy floors underfoot as the camera pans over dilapidated buildings and old furniture. This vision doesn't vary between prison or Bronson's home life.This film is as 'real' as its possible to get about British prison life. For critics who've argued that Bronson the film glamorises Bronson the man, well, they're talking rubbish. It doesn't. It portrays him as an offender, a deeply crude, foul-mouthed and quite frightening man. Even when naked, which frequently happens in this film, Bronson the character is frightening. It is a tribute to Tom Hardy's acting that he can portray such a character without being squeamish about what this man is. It is also a tribute to the director that he doesn't flinch from the violent, unpleasant and often loathsome aspects at work here. As of writing, Bronson is still inside prison. He will undoubtedly die there. Perhaps seeing this film will prevent one more angry young man from considering the same path.",Bronson
81,someokiedude,"And would you like a cup of tea too, mate?",10,17 June 2020,"Bronson is a film that I lobby alongside films as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas or more appropriately, A Clockwork Orange. It, much like those other two, is a film that is so insane, so depraved, so tasteless, that it's hard not to appreciate it. Refn's most obvious cinematic debt is Kubrick's 1971 opus, but the film is purely Refn's. His style and touch are all over this film even as it goes into the chaotic and the anarchic, much like the man whom the film is about.Michael Gordon Peterson, or as he would come to be known as Charles Bronson, is not a man you want to trifle with. One moment he could be as friendly and affable as any other common man, but at the flip of a second he could viciously beat you into a pulp. Even he admits as the film goes on that he's not a man that you'd like to meet in a lonely alleyway at night. Bronson is easily one of the most unique biopics that has ever graced the screen along with something like Amadeus. Much like Amadeus, it blends fact and fiction until it becomes something entirely new.Refn's visuals feel...dissociative, almost as if you've entered the twisted mind of Charles Bronson and he doesn't plan to let you out. The music, much like A Clockwork Orange, combines the beautiful with the mechanical, but Refn's taste in music also shows in this film as well, combining classical with strange 80s music that makes you nostalgic and also feel uncomfortable. Refn's fascination with the grotesque is also apparent with this film. The way that Refn holds on the uncomfortable moments is what truly make the tension of the film work so well.Tom Hardy is exquisite in the role of Bronson, and the role that I hold to be Hardy's finest to date. His performance is what drives the film forward, and I would almost call it a one man show, without it being one like his later film Locke. Hardy manages to combine the almost cartoonish black comedy of the character, while also being intimidating at the same time. Hardy's control and his intimidation keeps him from becoming a joke, and his surreal sense of humor is what keeps him from being a monster.To end it off, I might as well end it off with a quote from the man himself, as it's nice when a film can review itself.""Brilliant! I liked it personally...I loved it! It was exciting! It was on the edge! It was madness at its very best.""",Bronson
82,rolandddd,All about Hardy's performance,7,1 July 2013,"Danish filmmaker Nicolas Widning Refn's films usually centers around violence of some sort, and this movie is no different. The film is a loose biography of ""the most violent prisoner in Britain"", Michael Peterson aka Charles Bronson.This is without a doubt Tom Hardy's true star-making performance. He delivers a completely convincing and charismatic performance as the enigmatic Charles Bronson. He manages to portray his immense physical presence, his violent nature but also his more charismatic traits and his weird sense of humor. He doesn't shy away from Bronson's more bizarre behavior either.The film is beautifully shot and portrays life outside the prison walls in 70s and 80s Britain in the same drab colors as life within prison walls. This is a huge contrast to the fairy tale-like and colorful scenes of Bronson on stage in theater makeup in short scenes inter-cut with scenes from Bronson's life. There is also a wonderfully bizarre scene of prisoners having some sort of disco to Pet Shop Boys' ""It's a Sin"".Overall, the movie explores the many sides of a man with a natural predisposition for violence, and how society deals with such an individual. The best thing about it is undeniably Hardy's superb performance as the title character. On the other hand, there's really not too much else to watch, there are hardly any supporting characters and no subplots, so it's a 7 for me.",Bronson

He is incredibly engaging and incredibly disturbing. He can be engaging, but more often than not, he is incredibly angry and very prone to violence. Correction, he is pure violence, it is the thing he most desires. Of course. his actions only lead to his continuous stay in prison, but that is fine with him, he loves it there. Very surreal, very strange, very hypnotic. Lots of great music, powerful performances, ultra-violent, great film!",Bronson
84,thesubstream,The most violent prisoner in Britain just wants to perform,8,4 November 2009,"Michael Peterson, renamed Charles Bronson by his bare-knuckle boxing manager, is ""Britain's most violent prisoner"". He bungled a robbery of a post-office in 1974 at the age of 22, took twenty-odd pounds, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. He managed to stretch that term to life in confinement (having spent over 30 years in solitary) through a series of offences including assault, criminal damage, kidnapping, blackmail and climbing up on the roof of Broadmoor prison and lighting it on fire.Nicolas Winding Refn's biopic stars Tom Hardy as the titular Bronson, a shaven-headed mustachioed dynamo, tense and stalking in circles inside cells. The film cuts between jarring, startling theatrical monologues in which Bronson directly relays his history, his desire to be famous and infamous and scenes from the man's grim, terrifying and hilarious journey through seemingly every prison cell and mental hospital in England. It's a showcase for a spectacular performance, Tom Hardy's, and he is allowed to express the full range of Bronson's very real idiosyncrasy – he is by turns menacing and engaging, capable of hair-trigger violence but never without seeming cause and never on terms favouring him. He doesn't fight a guard caught alone in a cell, he strips naked and greases himself and fights the four that enter to save their comrade. And loses. Again and again. Hardy absolutely seizes the role and invents from a unique subject an utterly unique, completely believable character and masters him in voice, poise and gesture, a breathtaking, technical performance.Had he been in a film made by a director more concerned with commercial appeal, it'd be the ""buzz"" performance of the year, but had that been true it would also be true that the performance itself couldn't have been as strong. Refn constructs a film whose every frame supports its central character's refusal to ascribe meaning or choice or reason to any of his actions. It's mannered and considered and as reminiscent of Kubrick's composition and sets as Bronson's call for music in exchange for a painted hostage is of Alex's love of ultraviolence and Beethoven in that director's A Clockwork Orange.In making such a film, though, one in which a character whose strength and smirking power obliterates the chance or hope or possibility of there being a solution or a cause or an avoidable mistake having been made and noted, Refn has made a film that's curiously cold. We marvel at Hardy's Bronson but the relationship he builds with us and with the audience for whom he performs his vaudeville routines is one of love and admiration but completely bereft of empathy or concern. As Bronson tosses himself at the feet of angry guard after angry guard caring not at all about what happens to him or them, our awe neuters our ability to feel concern and to worry at all about what will happen to the man. Like the film, the man is impressive, colossal and utterly unmoving.",Bronson

The whole movie has a Kubrick feel to it in its visual appeal. The shots are long, deliberate, and intensely visual. The colors are often alternating between overly intense and overly dull, which creates a great contrast between the outside world/mental hospital (dull) and the inside one (gritty and brightened). This is a subtle difference, but helps to emphasize the oddity of Bronson, a man who prefers to stay in prison.The movie is pretty straightforward, showing you a good chunk of Bronson's life. There aren't a whole bunch of twists and turns, but there are some amazing scenes of violence, and some incredible images, particularly a few very incredible tracking shots. There are also some extremely strange and hilarious moments. In general, there is something both funny and brutal about Bronson, but in the end he's the only one 'laughing'.

Based on individual performances, I enjoyed him more in this that anything else, including Bane or the Revenant. He plays Charlie Bronson in this dramatization of his life story. Tom Hardy plays this role to its fullest. He is an intimidating, powerfully, unpredictable character that seems to just be out for a good fight. He doesn't really care about consequences or what could happen to him at all, as he just seems run by a controlled impulse of sorts. The theme is set up by introducing Bronson and showing us what he did wrong to get into prison in the first place. From there, he wreaks havoc in the prison until his release. He then finds his niche in the world as an underground fighter until he goes back to prison. The movie is narrated by Bronson himself as a one man play. It really shows insanity in the character as he describes what he went through and why he ended up where he did. By the end, you actually feel bad for Bronson. He is a crazed criminal who assaults anyone he can and causes problems for everyone he gets involved with. But he seems tortured. He is stuck in prison long past he ever should be even though he never committed a murder or anything close to justifying his sentence. He is mentally and physically tormented.

While watching it I kept thinking I was watching ""A Clockwork Orange Part II."" The lead actor was amazing in what was an incredibly challenging role. The character of Charles Bronson is a pretty complex individual. He is incredibly volatile and extremely violent, yet somehow, you empathize with him. Why is Bronson so self-destructive? Nobody knows, not even him. Of course the film does not pretend to know why. Nobody will ever know, not even Bronson himself. Whatever is the wrong play, Bronson will make it. If you want to be blown away by a unique and surreal experience, watch this!",Bronson
93,tokanac,A crazy action flick with barely any explanation!,3,8 September 2018,"An interesting movie, but I don't think that Michael Peterson/Charles Bronson deserves the fame; after all, he beat up guard after guard without remorse and he's wanted to be famous, which is exactly what this film has made him. He's milking his fame for all its worth, releasing fitness books, offering his fans the opportunity to meet him in person within the prison walls...However, back to the movie itself. While it was interesting to watch, it really didn't make much sense, as it didn't really explain things. It's like the writer just wanted to jump in and then realised that he needed to give some backstory, so he did without really committing to it; it was just a waste of time from the writer's viewpoint! There were a lot of jump cuts and important dialogue was missing - his girlfriend visits him in jail, but they exchange no dialogue? What's the point in having that scene in there? It's like it was just filler! When did Michael Peterson/Charles Bronson become interested in art? There were vital parts of the story left out. Also, why did he like to incite violence upon the guards? Was it purely because he was insane?I think the writers just wanted to create an action movie and didn't pay much attention to the story or how to make it flow. I understand that you can't fit everything in or explain everything in the timeframe that it had, but it's as if they couldn't be bothered, or didn't know how. If that's the case, how do they expect the audience to be bothered watching it?Tom Hardy did a good job with what he had to work with, and it is a shame that the writers and director let him down. The comedy scenes weren't too bad and were probably the most entertaining parts of the entire story!Some reviewers are complaining of there being too much violence, language and nudity (to the extreme). I agree with the first two points, as there was a lot of violence and language (blame that on the writers, and, probably Bronson himself). The nudity, however, wasn't excessive; there was only full-frontal nudity in seven scenes out of many! I don't believe it should be MA 15+, though; it should be rated R18+, considering the amount of violence, language and nudity. Was this a good movie? Eh, it was okay! Would I see it again? No, I would not!",Bronson

95,andymcneill75,Tom Hardy was Amazing! Look out for this dude!!,8,22 August 2009,"Like i said above Tom Hardy was brilliant in this and played Bronson like a hard, ruthless maniac that he really is. I liked how he had good bits of comedic value, brought a stagey feel to the role and although very over the top it was a short and sweet film. Not brilliant but well made and very different to the classic and very violent Pusher films that Nicolas Winding Refn made - can't wait for his viking epic set in Scotland, Valhalla Rising! Matt King was great in his cameo as the very camp Paul and had a couple of funny lines too. Although the film is good Hardy is a real star in the making and has a wide range of roles that he has played and he will move on to some great things. From the camp thug in Rocknrolla to this to playing a 80s ned in TV's The Take to playing Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights this guy sounds like he will do anything and he's in Inception so that's testimony that his talent has been noticed!Hardy for a best supporting actor nom at least?",Bronson

One whom seems to have no ambition on real life that he would rather be in prison and make a name for himself. He's an insecure man and uses brutal force and meanness to survive. It was a bizaar movie. Had hard time with watching the insane inmate defecating into his hand and rubbing it on his face or the scene with Bronson having the jailer rub his seman all over himself. It was gross and disgusting. I had a hard time watching this movie with the language and content.

The fact that this movie has a very weak storyline, weak premise, trying too hard and very weak impression should tells us that the producer, director and whoever else involved in making Brunson is out of their mind.In no way this is a breakthrough. This must rank way way down in its own genre, which I'm sure will be called ""crappy movies lacking imagination"". Oh wait a minute, the music sucked too. I would think that's one of the area they could get right since, well, it's not so hard picking good music.All in all, they are trying to hard to make a certain kind of movie and it fails.

98,lwood28,"A ""Magnificent"" Performance from Tom Hardy",8,2 July 2014,"*Story: A 19 year old Michael Peterson attempted to rob a post office with a sawed-off shotgun and is sentenced to 7 years in prison. Peterson was a troublemaker and got in a lot of fights with guards and spends 34 years in prison, 30 which he has spend in solitary confinement. During his sentence Peterson has an alter ego named ""Charles Bronson"".*Review: Bronson is probably one of the most overlooked movies ever made and an overlooked performance from Tom Hardy. Everyone keeps on comparing this movie to Clockwork Orange which I agree to because of the music they play and how crazy the main character acts and behaves. What Charles Bronson does during prison is very interesting because you learn what he does in his free time which is mostly beating the crap out of guards and covering himself in butter. One complain that I have with the movie is that there really is no story. It's just Bronson being Bronson and what he did in prison. Overall this movie is really good but if your going to watch this just watch it for Tom Hardy's performance. If your a fan of Tom Hardy or Nicolas Refn who directed Drive and Only God Forgives you'll probably like this movie.(singing) ""Please, release me, oh let me go!

99,graham_525,What was the point?,1,1 June 2010,"I'm not sure exactly what this film wants us to learn about Michael Peterson or Charles Bronson. All I learned about him was that he is an extremely violent self absorbed sociopath who lives in a tragic deluded fantasy world. Nothing else was offered, no hidden depths revealed. In the end he was just a violent sadistic idiot. The heavy handed stylisation of the film was overly self conscious and blatantly copied from Clockwork Orange amongst other films. There was a clumsy attempt to turn scenes of violence into artistic aesthetic moments by using Stanley Kubric's method of showing them in slow motion with classical music playing in the background. The shear amount of extremely violent scenes grow painfully tedious. The way the film dealt with the hostage taking of Phil Danielson was offensive and totally disrespectful to Danielson himself who's life was ruined by the experience. Danielson was shown as a foppish idiot who deserved everything he got from Bronson. In reality Danielson was held captive for over 40 hours and was made to walk around the prison like a dog and was told by Brosnson that he was going to die. Bronson apologised in court to Danielson and his family which Bronson's supporters see as proof of the fundamental decency of the man. I don't buy into the Bronson supporter's propaganda. Bronson is artistic they tell us. Yeah and so? I actually checked out his so called art online and it's talentless childish rubbish. Even if it wasn't I don't see why that means he should be released. Perhaps his supporters should try being held hostage by him for 40 hours. Bronson is warm hearted and funny they tell us. Yeah, Bronson and every other psychopath. Warmhearted until they take a dislike to you and use that as a justification for stamping on your head. I don't see why this man should have had a film made about him, especially one that didn't seem to have any point to it. Having seen the film I hope he stays where he is, locked up safe and sound.",Bronson

True Cinema at its Finest!,10,26 November 2019,"This movie is proof that you do not need a huge budget packed with large Hollywood names, CGI, and expensive sets to make an amazing film. All you need is an actor who can preform, a couple of locations, and a killer script filled with original thought.This movie is an absolute delight putting the talented Tom Hardy center stage, allowing his brilliant character development to shine. His performance really allows us as viewers to get into the head of an insane individual who finds pleasure in the UK penitentiary system fighting other convicts and the officers that guard him. With unique plot development you will find yourself both laughing at his absurdness while also longing for his naive nature.A truly original film, that reminds us cinephiles as to why we love films.This movie is a true gem that really deserves praise for its ability to further independent filmmaking and it is for that reason I give it an 9/10.",Bronson

If this film is any indication, his future is very bright. Some might find this film dark, but it's simply one of the best dramas or biopics I've ever seen. Hardy's performance is Oscar worthy. I have not seen ""Drive"" yet, but I am definitely intrigued after watching ""Bronson."" Winding Refn obviously has a unique eye for storytelling. I plan to check out his other films now, too, including ""Valhalla Rising."" As for Hardy, he joins a talented, new crop of British actors who are blazing up the screen.

103,sharkies69,Intense and brutal drama - makes Scum seem like a Disney movie. Jake the Muss would be proud.,7,9 June 2009,"Saw this the other day at the Sydney Film Festival.I didn't know much about Bronson before the film, other than what I read on Wikipedia and after walking out of the cinema, I can't say I know any more about the man other than his inability to conform and his reliance on violence and abuse to deal with most situations.Unlike Korean movie Breathless which also screened at the festival and focused on violence but at least gave you an idea as to why the main character was so disturbed and messed up. Bronson doesn't give you any answers other than he was simply born that way, despite loving parents. His inability to deal with society starting as early as his school years.What I did enjoy was Hardy's performance. Sure to be compared to Bana's Chopper (which I think was far better - but I am an Aussie and therefore biased) and also A Clockwork Orange. Hardy is impressive as the hulking and impulsive brute. He occasionally shows us Bronson's vulnerable side but mostly it's about the rage that drives him from one prison to another.The prison system and Brit government are seemingly helpless to come up with solutions at dealing with Bronson's violence. The man himself also seems way beyond rehabilitation. That would be a big understatement.I thought it was a shame that Bronson didn't get into boxing or some other type of physical sport like Rugby league when he was younger as it might have given him an outlet for his anger.Anyways, it's ultimately pretty grim viewing but certainly packs a punch (no pun intended). I would have like to see Winding Refn offer us a little more insight into the man.",Bronson

105,peter-j-downey,Too pretentious to be good.,6,18 February 2015,"How does someone who wants to be infamous view themselves? Nicolas Winding Refn explores this idea through Michael Gordon Peterson (Tom Hardy), or more commonly known Charles Bronson, or as he is known in the media Britain's most violent prison inmate.Refn creates this world through an elaborate, dramatic and camp style, and creates a film that forces us to look at the chaos of Bronson's life. The audience is treated to great assortment of interesting visual tones and settings, and the back on forth between the stage monologues and the real life incidents pierces Bronson's consciousness. The soundtrack of the film also adds a sense of location and narrative film, and perfectly complements the visual tone of the film.Hardy seems to have a lot of fun in this film as Refn seems to have let him off a leash. Bronson narrates the film in a vaudeville style and this is interspersed with extremely violent and physical scenes; so Hardy overacts and is bombastic. Then in other scenes where we have Bronson brooding or planning, Hardy is allowed to just fill the screen with his presence. Refn also took some liberties with the secondary characters and directs to harmonize with Hardy's acting. Matt King as Bronson's fellow inmate and bare knuckle boxing; Paul Daniels, is flamboyant and physically effectual, and Refn does to same for Bronson's family, lover and associates.This film, however, isn't without its flaws, some of which are pretty unforgivable. Refn shows a poor understanding of pacing, and this film feels like every second of its 92 minutes; scenes drag and repeat. For example, the circular nature of the scenes in the mental prison, where we have some action followed by a stagnant shot of a cationic or defeated Bronson drags the movie out. There is also far too much slow-motion shots; firstly this distracts from the gritty setting of the prison, and does not suit crime film of this type. Secondly, it makes the hits less painful and more cartoonish, Bronson isn't super-human, and we are reminded of this when we find him beaten up and drugged, so this contradictory effect makes the slow motion feel pretentious.Bronson as a character is also impossible to relate to. We must consider that his life is incredibly boring, he spends most of days trying to force himself back into a 6x8ft cell. He's a psychopath who has no real life connections, and the majority of relationships end the same way, into a hostage situation. The dialogue is a bit melodramatic as well, in my mind they forced drama into scenes just to divert the attention of the viewer as it doesn't take much to piece together what Bronson is about to do next.Looking at this film as a whole it's hard to make a decision whether this movie is pretentious or effective. Refn straddles this fence in any other film I have seen of his, and this one falls all too often in this film.",Bronson
106,arus_royus,A Tragedy,7,9 November 2011,"Bronson is a movie about the desperation of human nature, the inability to break out of a cycle which spirals downward endlessly. A heart breaking movie about a man who is trapped and lost inside himself, the most striking example are the end and the beginning, the movie starts out with Bronson in solitary confinement pacing around like a caged tiger, while the end depicts him almost completely immobile in a tiny cage where he can't even lie down; his state of being, I'd say. I doubt they actually ""kept"" him like this, but it very well conveys the state of his soul.A true tragic movie which is not really accessible to the general public. Still worth a view, to study the destructive side of human kind.",Bronson
107,anteksw,An Abstract Journey,9,29 March 2015,"Yesterday I finally had the chance to watch 'Bronson' - a film I've been wanting to see for quite a while now, not only due to the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Winding Refn's other work such as 'Drive' and 'Only God Forgives', but also because I was curious about Tom Hardy's performance being described as ""his best ever"" by many people, as well as of course the film's evident abstract style. Yeah, this time around, there were no sceptical thoughts surrounding my mind... just a lot of curiosity and excitement to view another strangely compelling film.'Bronson', clearly influenced by Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', explores the journey of what I would essentially call a ""psychopath"". This journey essentially entails switching lock-up facilities, creating/developing relations and of course nicely crafted ""fight"" sequences. This journey, for the most part, is evidently explored through Michael Peterson's simple state of mind - life is seemingly simple and easygoing, and according to our main character's objectives and actions... vocal and physical violence is a vital part of life. Yes, this is a somewhat simple plot, however... the plot is not what makes this film great, it's the overriding quirky yet disturbing tone 'Bronson' carries - the overall style is what makes this film great.The editing, cinematography and soundtrack are all undeniably masterful - I was additionally very pleased about the Pet Shop Boys being featured. The soundtrack is very elaborate in terms of variety, yet it complements each scene's tone and overall execution almost flawlessly. Apart from the film's unique construction on the technical side, Tom Hardy's performance is what gives it that extra kick - I haven't seen enough of Hardy's filmography to form a proper judgement on whether this is his best work or not, however, it is undoubtedly a brave and powerful performance that will stick with you for days. 'Bronson' is a swiftly paced, cleverly constructed, and an enjoyably abstract journey told through the mind of a ""psychopath"".",Bronson

109,iepw12,Not for the faint hearted.Tom Hardy beyond words,8,12 September 2015,"The only reason I have given this 8 out of ten is because I found much of it hard to watch.Tom Hardy has become one of my favourite actors of late with stunning performances every time he graces the screen but much of what this film deals with , institutionalised violence and mental instability which I do not find entertaining whilst acknowledging its existence and understanding that it should not remain hidden personally I don't feel the need for the graphicacey we experience here as with a number of other almost surreal classics from Kubric, Roeg,Antonioni et al. I guess, putting society's desperate need for the cult of celebrity aside I think this film becomes an extraordinary exercise in characterisation on the part of TH to rival anything I have seen in cinema over the last sixty years.I had the feeling at times that what I was watching was how far an actor could transform themselves into projecting the existence of another person to move you to almost like that character no matter how awful that character might be.I am minded of Charlton Hestons last performance as the Natzi criminal Mengaler with which he almost had the audience believing that his(Mengeler's) ethos was correct and the whole of the rest of society was out of step.So what you experience with this film is a performance beyond words creating an empathy and sympathy for the character which is probably misplaced in the cold light of day but it leaves you questioning the ineptitude and lack of ability on the part of us (society) as Bronsons keepers to resolve or at least help resolve his issues rather than exacerbate them which is how it appears from what we see.So in summation, Tom Hardy 10/10 subject matter , not sure, I don't know whether I needed to see it or not but I do not feel the need to watch it again but maybe one viewing is necessary just to admire the performance which as I said, is beyond words!!",Bronson

I think he played Bronson's character in a self absorbed way. He made me laugh, dropped my jaw with his sheer violent nature, and I never felt sorry for him once. I had no idea what was going to happen next. I enjoyed the stage show atmosphere being mixed into the various prison and insane asylum locations. It held my attention through out the film and showed a different prison experience. He had depth and reacted as someone who spent 30 of 34 yrs in solitary confinement. The guards were brutal and met each of his challenges head on without retreat. I think it showed a very realistic side of ""Britans most violent criminal"". I think this is one of the best films I have ever seen and I will definitely watch it again!!!! Props to you Mr Hardy for showing that you are a master at the art of acting!!!!",Bronson
111,jtprius510,"An Incorrigible, Schizophrenic, Testosterone Fueled, Massacre",8,28 September 2011,"Besides being the most violent prisoner in Britain's system, tom hardy as Charles Bronson in Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson is by far the most eccentric fighter I have ever seen filmed.When a friend of mine described a scene from Bronson to me, he made Hardy sound like ten times the beast that he actually is in this film so when I bought it and popped it in to the player expecting Jackie Chan, I was pleasantly surprised by how much of the opposite I got.Unless he is tussling one on one with somebody probably defenseless almost every single one of his brawls end in the same results. He might plan a strategic response to the guards' entrance of waving batons' different, but the numbers they come in are always prepared for whatever he has ready. He never wins and it's this confidence in his character to every one of their entrances that makes Hardy as Charles Bronson hilarious.The actions of Charles Bronson do not change nearly as much as the settings he is placed in. And the places do not change progressively. By that I mean the places only change between the cells colored by either red or blue, unless he is in an underground fight or dance club ran by one of his eccentric connections. The color scheme of Bronson has to be the only thing I took seriously.Besides all of Refn's trademarks in film, this is a just a charismatic brute comedy about somebody trying to substantiate a meaning to his violent existence by telling his story.From behind the lens of Refn this is depicted as both funny yet sad. Funny first in the way most people that like beating the crap out of every person they see usually is yet sad in the same way as there are only so many places that road can lead. I hardly think Refn is condoning the character of Charles Bronson as much as he is examining it in this humorous character study.His real name is Michael Peters but Charlie Bronson is his fighting name. Tom hardy as Michael Peters wants to die as Charles Bronson. He's always wanted to be famous, and he becomes just that, no matter how ill that fame is.",Bronson

How the academy left this film in the dust without one single nomination is beyond me. One thing is for sure, the director Nicolas Winding Refn is a force to be reckoned with.

113,aklcraigc,Refn Does Kubrick.,7,13 December 2014,"To be unkind, one could say this movie is simply a second rate 'A Clockwork Orange', but I think that would be oversimplifying matters. The plot, as such, is the usual variations on 'a rake's progress', except the rake doesn't do much apart from beating various people to a pulp and/or taking them hostage. On the positive side, Tom Hardy is fantastic in the main role, his menacing presence carries the film. Many scenes are executed with energy and humour. On the negative side, the whole visual style of the film is lifted wholesale from 'A Clockwork Orange', complete with ironic use of classical music. One might think that this in itself is not a bad thing, but this is where 'Bronson' starts to suffer by comparison. Whereas 'A Clockwork Orange' explores questions regarding freewill, the role of the state and the nature of evil - to name a few - 'Bronson' simply moves from one episode to another with no real feeling of evolution. One could argue that this is simply the nature of the story, the main character does not evolve and there is nothing to ponder on, but this renders the whole affair somewhat one-dimensional. Overall, this is a movie worth watching, just don't expect to be left with anything to ponder on once it's over.",Bronson

Sadly for me though it was really only his performance that carried the movie along.I freely admit that I didn't know much about the man before I saw this movie, but most of the film seemed to be Bronson beating prison guards up in various different locations & not much more. I know he got re-married - where was this? OK he spent most of his life behind bars, but surely there was a bit more to the mans life than what we saw?I've read that Bronson was quite happy about this movie & that it has given him some immortality, however I'm not sure that it really is going to leave people with the impression of him that he thinks. I certainly didn't leave the cinema thinking of him as a ""billy the kid / Jessie James"" anti-hero, but instead pitied him as a lost, out of control man who knew nothing but violence - more of a tortured soul.",Bronson

His manic twitches and violent outbursts really fleshed out an extravagant and bourgeois ""fight till I can't stand"" inmate.Still, as a whole, I did not enjoy the movie all that much. At times it felt just like a collection of random scenes glued together only by Bronson's presence and not much else. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but some scenes simply outshine everything else. For example, the last act with the art tutor - that's definitely the cherry on top of the cake - has a completely different tone.

119,Kinetek,Art & Punishment,6,25 September 2009,"Being a huge fan of prison movies such as Chopper, Ghosts Of The Civil Dead and such like, I was quite looking forward to seeing Bronson - the story of self-titled sociopath and all-round hard-man Charlie Bronson - and I'm not quite sure how I felt about it to be perfectly honest.Now, I'm a strong believer in convention and everything in it's right place and all that stuff. Bronson, however, does attempt to break the mould - but unfortunately, I don't think it knew how to put it back together again. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed a good deal of art-house movies in the past - but then, they were dealing primarily with art for art's sake. This is the story of a convicted sociopath and attempted murderer.You can see my dilemma can't you.While the film skirts around fact, most of it seems content to further glorify the kind of behaviour that got Bronson into trouble in the first place without much thought for anything else. The lighting and sets are very Kubrickesque, the acting very Lynchian. At times it rather makes you feel like you've eaten the wrong type of mushroom gathered on that field trip.That said, it's entertaining enough but it does seem to try a little too hard to be something that it really was never meant to be - ironically, this is indicative of Charlie Bronson too. There are genuine moments of hilarity (the 'art' teacher scene is frankly unforgettable) and the 'split personality on stage' scene is majestically performed. All in all though, it seems a little fractured with the direction constantly going off on a tangent and staying there just a little too long.I'm giving this 6.1 out of 10 - but with the right people behind this project, it could have been so much more. Pity.",Bronson
120,Vovion,A true character study.,9,8 July 2009,"Going into 'Bronson' I think it will help your viewing experience to know what to expect beforehand, so the shock of what you're seeing doesn't cloud the reason for why your seeing it.So, based on that idea you should know there is a lot of graphic violence, constant swearing, nudity, obscenity and its all completely unapologetic. Some have confused this with glamorisation when instead 'Bronson' is as pure of a character study you will find and due to this the film, not only uses the character as a subject, but the film becomes the subject through replicating Bronson's world. When the camera 'glamorises' the violence Bronson is committing, it is mirroring the way he sees it, as fun, necessary and rewarding. We are reminded of this disturbed reality when at intervals the film will revert into Bronson's head, where he is on stage in front of an appreciative audience who understand and empathise with everything he says.This intricate, intelligent and highly effective way of film-making is one of the elements, which makes it one of the best films of the year so far. As a character study, there are few other films that I can recall which show such dedication in trying to understand the character. Most will take either a positive or negative approach and try to influence the viewer, but because the film decides to show him in both objective states (locked in a tiny cell and completely dehumanised) and subjective states (Bronson's reality) the audience can decide on their own picture of the man through both from the factual resource of what he's done, and his view on reality.The second element, which makes this film successful, is the consistently impressive Tom Hardy. He gives himself to this role completely and makes the character intense, funny, scary and totally believable, sometimes all at the same time. I highly doubt there will be a better performance this year and unfortunately I also doubt he won't receive the accolades he deserves for it.If you're interested in character studies or intimate films I strongly recommend 'Bronson'. It shows a version of reality distorted yet validated and contains a performance by Hardy that makes you believe in it.",Bronson
121,amelie_jones,Mesmerising film,9,6 March 2021,"The whole movie has a surreal tone with every scene, every movement studied and stylised. There's no realism, just choreography of actions and movements in great cinematography. Funny, involuntarily funny, scary, deranged, entertaining, in love, violent and unhinged and probably more sides to the character make for a gripping hour and a half. It's very much an arthouse movie that I enjoyed a lot thanks to Hardy's fantastic performance.The movie seems very aware of what it's creating for the viewer so that in the last scene it starkly reminds you that this is not in fact a pleasant enjoyable story and it doesn't allow you to leave the movie feeling entertained.Nicolas Winding Refn directed, so you know there's lots of artistic gory violence. Tom Hardy plays inmate Charles Bronson, the ""most violent prisoner in Britain"", telling his own story.Bronson sees himself as a misunderstood entertainer and is shown presenting his life as an inmate and, more artistically, as a one man show on stage, which are used to frame scenes from prison and his life. While he didn't kill anyone, his extremely violent behaviour ""on the inside"" meant that he's still serving a lifetime sentence of which so far 30 years have been in solitary.The acting here from Hardy is mesmerizing to the point where I think had this been a more accessible movie (not 18+/ R rating) powered by Hollywood, this was Oscar worthy. Here he fully transformed physically and in his mannerisms, which Bronson himself appreciated. Probably for the first time in his career he shows his ability to carry an entire movie. He met with Bronson several times and the man sent him his actual shaved moustache which was used for the character.",Bronson

Thanks to Tom Hardy's powerful performance and applied art stuff, this movie is about an epic portrait of criminal artist. Moreover, it's the counterpart of Drive (2011 by Nicolas Winding Refn) because it also tells the protagonist's masculinity. If the Driver's masculinity in Drive is positive, Bronson's masculinity would be negative but they both have something in common. They both might be cinema lovers (Ryan Gosling's character works as a stuntman while Tom Hardy's character was named after a legendary action star: Charles Bronson) Furthermore, the OST is really dope.",Bronson

This movie turned me into an instant Hardy fan. His narration throughout the movie was spot on. It was tongue in cheek from beginning to end. Like you were in a pub talking to him over a pint, or 10. The scenes were, yes, graphic, but that was necessary for the story telling. Peterson was not a nice guy. It's a very real look into the mind of a violent criminal with a humour one would not expect. Hardy put it all out for the audience to absorb. His dedication to the part was obvious. The writing was exceptional. True street criminal chat filled, yes, with foul language that both fit the narrative and added real colour to the film. I truly enjoyed this flick. It kept me riveted!",Bronson

126,MaxDM,Glorified Violence,1,25 April 2013,"This movie starts of with the title ""Based on a true story"". As a career law enforcement officer of the UK and a crime research enthusiast, I have to say this is very, very loosely based on real facts. If you watch the extra's with the director, he will even tell you that his information on the Bronson facts are based on rumors and newspaper clippings.Unfortunately, the movie glorifies the exorbitant violence that Bronson wanted to be known for. In reality, every law enforcement officer or prison guard will tell you that he was not much different when compared to any other prisoner.To enhance the visual impact of the movie, the level of graphic male nudity is extreme to the point where Tom Hardy may as well played the movie sans clothes. Numerous penile close-ups make you wondering if the movie would border on soft porn.Overall, this movie is portrayed as a British ""Hollywood"" version of events, due to its incorrect facts, its ""artsy"" persona, I would not recommend this movie. Only a gullible lay person would swallow such drama.The most unfortunate part is that a misinformed director has given one of Britain's men exactly what he wanted; glorification at the expense of his victims.",Bronson
127,southsidepopper,Great Acting,8,3 December 2009,"I never even heard of this movie until I was browsing through movies to download. I read the description of the movie and was hooked. The movie did just what I expected and also added in some elements I wasn't expecting. Of course I was expecting there to be quite a bit of violence in the movie, which it delivered. What I wasn't expecting was how funny the movie was. The actor playing Bronson did a GREAT job. He really played a crazed, violent, madman very well. I caught myself laughing out loud at certain parts of the movie, which I rarely do, especially with action movies. Overall a great movie that I would recommend to anyone. The only problem I had with the movie was the extensive amount of male full frontal nudity. It would have been a perfect 10, or at the least a 9, if the movie was without any male nudity.",Bronson
128,Samhuinn,A poignantly realistic portrayal of a sick and sad man,8,9 April 2014,"Before growing up to become Britain most violent prisoner and spending the majority of his adult life in solitary confinement, Charlie Bronson was born as Michael Peterson to respectable parents. Driven by his ambition of becoming famous he turns, in turn, from a temperamental young man into a petty criminal and a notorious bare-knuckle boxer.'Bronson' (Winding Refn, 2008) presents several assorted points from his youth and adult life, intercut with Charlie (portrayed by Tom Hardy) on stage before an audience and addressing the viewer directly from inside his prison cell. This unorthodox way of narration does take some getting used to, especially since the subject matter of the film and its advertising campaign hinted towards a film in a vein similar to Lock, stock and two smoking barrels (Ritchie, 1998). 'Bronson' does not take this route, opting instead for an intimate and highly stylized study of character.Much of the film's strength lies in the hands of Tom Hardy. Hardy's portrayal of Bronson as both charmingly unapologetic and sadly deranged is very poignant, which make scenes such as the several minutes long dance sequence in an insane asylum pack as big a punch as those in which he bare handedly fights off attacking pit-bulls in shabby sheds for a few quid. Commanding absolute dominance over every scene, Hardy is more than his impressive (and explicitly shown) physique. His ability to show the glimmers of fear and sadness through the cracks of his madness is brilliant, and helps greatly with offering understanding and sympathy for an otherwise two-dimensional and cartoonish character.This humility makes 'Bronson' an exceptionally brave film. Opting to focus upon Bronson's descent into madness over his career in bare-knuckle boxing, the film shies away from sensationalism and cheap thrills. That is not to say that they skimped on violence. The sudden and explosive outbursts of aggression are filmed with such intensity and realism that the viewer groans over every muffled punch and kick, especially in the dramatic light of Bronson's obvious yet untreated mental illness.Those hoping for exceptionally expressive violence need look elsewhere. Those, however, willing to give this under-appreciated gem a chance will be treated to a mammoth performance of the insanity of a man unable to get a grip on reality.(AREA 555 on Wordpress)",Bronson
129,lmighten,An excellent portrayal of Britain's most notorious prisoner.,8,15 November 2009,"This is a fantastic depiction of Charles Bronson, born Michael Peterson, Britain's most infamous and notorious prisoner. Director Nicholas Winding Refn invites us into Bronson's imagination, with parts of the film shot from the perspective of him being on stage in front of an adoring audience. The rest of the film is a dramatization of Bronson's life and times in prison. Bronson was initially incarcerated for seven years for the robbery of a post office where he stole £26.18. However he has spent 34 years in prison and psychiatric wards so far, and is still there, spending 30 of them in solitary confinement. He has been involved in fighting, brawls and hostage taking which led to his increased sentence, and he seems to enjoy it. No lives have been lost. This is an excellent performance from Tom Hardy –funny, thoroughly engaging and intense. He physically transformed himself for this role and obviously studied Bronson vigorously to accurately portray his mannerisms. A thoroughly compelling film. A must see!",Bronson

I've been following Charles Bronson for a long while now and was over the moon when i heard about this release... i have to give this a ten out of ten just by Tom Hardys performance alone and will be waiting for more appearances in the future............",Bronson
131,benthelazar,Impossible to dissect,8,2 July 2014,"Well, I just watched Bronson. I am kind of at a loss for words. I don't really know what to think. So I'll do some kind of stream of consciousness thing.What I do know about Bronson is it features an incredible starring performance by Tom Hardy in the title role. He walks the tightrope that every actor does when playing a madman. At times, he goes to close over the top. Close is the key word. He does a brilliant job of giving a restrained psychopath, which makes it terrifying but not entirely surprising when he beats the living daylights out everyone that he meets. There is not a moment where he seems too insane. He comes close, but never crosses, and the result is a brilliant performance. The other thing that I know about Bronson is that is nothing like any film I have, or probably will ever see. It is visually unique, it tells a story in a non linear fashion that seems in no way clichéd, it flips back and forth between our characters mind and the real word, sometimes with shocking suddenness. Its soundtrack is dynamic and well placed. Bronson is a movie that is more experienced than watched. It engages senses of sound and sight, but there is a smell of this movie. A texture. Less literal, but still there. It is wonderfully imaginative, blends genres and styles, and feels like a dream.And now I'm at a loss. I know Bronson is about something. I could spend the rest of the review trying to decide what it is about. Celebrity? Madness? Violence? Art? I don't know. I think no matter how many times I watch this movie I won't know. I don't even know if I liked this movie. Sometimes it was a little too weird for no reason, and it is maddeningly impossible to dissect. But I will try. I think that you should as well. It is a movie that I made an impression on me, and that is all I know. If you are considering renting it, do so. It is not a waste of time, money, or effort. I hope. I think that when I finally figure it out, this is a movie that will shape my thoughts on it's subject. Whatever that is.",Bronson
132,digdilem,"Magnetic performancy by Hardy, but that's it.",2,18 April 2020,"There's only a handful of actors that can convincingly portray the cold stillness of a truly violent man. Gary Oldman is one, Tom Hardy another.But... The story is weak. There's no significant attempt to understand why he does this or what drives the man, or what he hopes to achieve. Sure - there are glimpses, but nothing comes through in any meaningful way. It's little more than brooding silences and too many fight scenes.Similarly, other characters come and go. His wife and kid - just disappear from the story. His next love gets married to another man whilst he thinks they're exclusive. That's just taken on the chin and he moves on, seemingly without a backwards thought. There are some recognisable other actors, and some passable acting - but all suffer from weak direction and a strong sense of ""making it up as we go along"" comes through.But what really takes away from this is the breakout scenes of theatre and even random cartoon birds at one point and Pythonesque graphics. Absolutely dreadful.In summary. Good central acting spoiled by a frankly boring story and very poor direction. I wish I'd used the fast forward button instead of watching the whole thing.",Bronson
133,zapiekanki,Great use of music; mixed opinions,6,24 May 2010,"Bronson is not a film I would have watched (or a film I would have been interested in) was it not for the director: Nicolas Winding Refn.This Danish réalisateur has done some previous work that I enjoyed, like the three Pusher films and, to a lesser degree, Bleeder. In fact, I think the producers couldn't have chosen a better man to direct this project, for Winding Refn has that ability to create films whose atmosphere is dark, somber and bitter. I may also add that Refn creates tense and, at times, 'enraging' atmospheres (like he did in Bleeder).'Pusher 3' had already proved Winding Refn's ability to recreate hell on earth -and Bronson is not the exception.I think part of the success of Bronson is its use of music. Refn has amalgamated a number of acts from such disparate styles as punk, classical and opera. In fact, I can affirm that Bronson would have been a totally different movie had other music been used, or had no music at all been used.Could it be that a resource like music has been over-exploited in this film? (One can listen to 'Digital versicolor' kicking-in here and there in the movie). (And I don't remember Pusher been so dependant on music). What I concede to the director is his ability to also exploit intervals of silence (like when Bronson/Peterson is in the theatre in front of his audience or when he is sitting in the Luton brothel sipping a drink).The film has a very powerful opening scene (a fighting scene) and the great use of music, as well as the contrasting colors like red and black, make this a scene very hard to forget. In fact, I think many people, years down the road, if anything, will mostly remember this scene while evoking Bronson.But most of the momentum of the opening scene is lost in the following minutes. First we see a series of flashbacks revealing Bronson/Peterson's childhood, scenes that made me wonder whether I was in front of another 'Amélie Poulain' (in reference to the French film of the same name). At some point I even wondered whether the main character was just silly (or had mental problems). At the time of watching this movie I ignored the existence of a real Bronson/Peterson (of Welsh descent according to Wikipedia) who to this day is still locked up in a British prison. This extra information that I gathered (AFTER watching the movie) helped explain, in part, the weird acting of Tom Hardy.I gave this film a rating of 6. Although I still think Mr. Winding Refn was the right director for the job, I think he could have done much better, given his previous credentials. The hell he creates in Bronson is fairly obvious (a prison) while in Pusher 3, to cite another reviewer who has written elsewhere on IMDb, Refn created ""an almost unbearable atmosphere, making the capital of Denmark look like hell on earth"".",Bronson

135,lukedela,All the world's a stage,8,17 July 2009,"Bold, brutal, disturbing and funny in equal measure. This is a fascinating biopic of a man that was and still is a complete enigma. Central to the film's success is the performance of Tom Hardy in the lead role. Both fearless and chaotic in equal measure, he brings forth the menace and unpredictable nature of the character of Bronson inflicting it on the audience. Equally, the cinematography is high on perfect, drawing the viewer into the cell with Bronson. However, meaning and structure is imposed were it is unwanted. The film tries to draw meaning and conclusions about Bronson were there are none. Its ending is disjointed as a result. Its difficult to criticise a film for being a film thoughNevertheless it is endlessly entertaining, stylish and never, ever dull.",Bronson
136,DoctorKingSchultz,A Reassessment,8,17 January 2012,"When I first viewed Bronson, it was the day after Drive opened in theaters. I was utterly blown away by its style and technical perfection, and the actors' performances so I decided to investigate director Nicolas Winding Refn's earlier films. Perhaps Drive was the wrong film to start with. Bronson, radically different from Drive, sports a much more avant garde style; I'd go as far as to say it's very similar to Kubrick. I was caught off guard. I enjoyed the style and Hardy's brilliance, but I wasn't quite in love with it. I gave it a 6/10, and moved on. Now here I am, having recently fallen in love with Refn's Valhalla Rising, giving Bronson a second chance. And I'm glad I did.Bronson is about a man, Michael Peterson, (Tom Hardy) who is bored with life. Maybe not even bored--from the start he's a nonconformist. He goes about his early years committing petty crimes until he one day robs a post office, gets arrested, and it's history from there. I'll avoid summary, as you may read that elsewhere if you wish. So Peterson seeks an outlet for his pent up boredom. His rage. Naturally, assaulting anyone near him is a viable passtime! Adopting the ""stage name"" Charles Bronson, Peterson becomes a celebrity of sorts. Tom Hardy is absolutely menacing as Bronson. At times you're convinced he's absolutely insane (and he is pretty crazy) while others he's simply flamboyant and over-the-top. But the times where he unleashes his anger and insanity are truly heart-stopping. Presenting his inner thoughts to us (literally the audience of the film) Bronson is a one man show giving his heartfelt take on his own feelings and inner thoughts.And I think that's what I missed about the film the first time around. I sought a storyline I could cling to; a beginning, middle, and end. Structure. Bronson, both the film and the man, is the opposite of structure. He's raw anger incarnate. The film is about his rage and his expression of anger and how he (sometimes) suppresses it. There is no structure when a mad bull charges. That is the equivalent of this film. Hardy's mustached, grinning madman is our guide through his own uncontrollable anger.So yes, Hardy is absolutely perfect in the title role. According to the real Bronson, no one else could've played him! But the other half of Bronson's brilliance comes from behind the camera. Refn has a true talent for framing shots, and often gives the film a surreal and colorful palette. Not only are the images mesmerizing, but they are accompanied by music that is both appropriate and the complete opposite of the images we see. Classical music playing as Bronson charges prison guards, or thumping electronic beats as he enters the underground fight scene (I particularly love the song that recurs throughout the film, and plays over the credits). The music adds a sort of order to the disorder, and creates a soothing scene that would be shaky-cam intensity with another director. That is Refn's brilliance: calmly displaying violence.So I hope my change of heart spurs you to revisit Bronson if you were unsatisfied initially. It's an odd film, but I found that it became more enjoyable once I allowed Bronson's chaos to overcome my concept of ""what a film should be"".",Bronson
137,denisababeanu,Brilliant!,9,27 October 2018,Probably the Bronson 's story is not very exciting but Hardy's brilliant acting makes all the money.,Bronson
138,truehammer,Explosive Art,8,28 July 2010,"Bronson is a film based on real events about Charlie Bronson who changed his name to the star of Death Wish during his brief bare-knuckled boxing stint, the notorious British criminal who has spent all but four of his 36 years in prison so far in solitary confinement. Bronson was born Michael Peterson and grew up in Luton with lower-middle class parents who rather bizarrely didn't abuse him in any way. If ever a man seemed a natural born monster it's Peterson, there is no rhyme nor reason to his behaviour, he claims his ambition is to 'be a someone' but sadly he has no talent bar a rock hard body and a fearlessness in violent conflict.After an armed robbery on a post office which gained him the incredible sum of £26.18 in 1974, Bronson aged 22 was given a seven year sentence. Since then Bronson's resume for violence has grown and grown, along with his sentence. It includes wounding with intent, wounding, criminal damage, grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment, blackmail and threatening to kill although tellingly he has never actually killed anyone, despite trying to strangle a paedophile to death in Broadmoor.Bronson's brief stretch on the outside probably reveals more about him than any of his time inside. It becomes clear that he simply doesn't know how to function in the real world, he becomes confused and frightened when faced by the difficulties of adult life, the simplicity of prison appeals to him and soon he is back inside after another ridiculous robbery. Inside he is a living legend and a truly feared man, he doesn't have to do anything except drawing and fighting, two things he excels at. Bronson also seems to have masochistic tendencies, he enjoys being punished, often when things are looking up for him he becomes his most restless and unpredictable. His attacks come quickly and with no warning, his favourite prison pastime is to kidnap a screw or prisoner, terrify them with his bizarre behaviour and make nonsensical demands to the governor before stripping naked, greasing himself up and seeing how many guards he can take out before he is beaten himself and thrown back in solitary.Whether or not Bronson is insane is debatable, he certainly isn't like other humans but does that make him crazy, who really knows? How any man can live that kind of existence is baffling. Tom Hardy is sensational as Bronson, his best performance so far and has a bright future ahead of him, he really captures Bronson's frightening personality, charm and sense of humour as Bronson although terrifying is a very funny man, perhaps his only redeeming feature. It is an explosive performance in every sense of the word and with a lesser actor the film might not have been half as good, occasionally Hardy delivers a monologue on stage to a hidden audience (ourselves as he sees us) deluding himself that we are cheering his psychotic rages as if he is a genuine hero.I definitely rate this movie highly but be warned this may be a little to artsy for your tastes, if you're expecting a beat-em-up action movie you may walk away disappointed, this delves into the world of something a little different than the norm and can be quite disturbing, particularly during the mental hospital scenes and the ending. The film reminds me of two others in particular: A Clockwork Orange and Chopper. The director clearly takes inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's classic and the style is not dissimilar, both are highly disturbing and difficult to watch and have vicious protagonists you cannot take your eyes from. The similarity to Chopper is that Bronson and Chopper Read seem to suffer from a similar infliction of character and are both real people. These movies are also highly recommended.Finally I have heard people say this this movie glamorises violence, absolute nonsense, if I ever saw a movie that made me want to stay far away from prison it is Bronson. He is a man to be pitied and feared, not admired and the movie shows just that.8/10",Bronson
139,varun_tamizh,Hardy all the way,7,21 July 2012,"Bronson is said to be one of Tom Hardy's best performances in his career and it is said to be a thrill ride. Read my review to know more.PLOT:Michael Gordon Peterson is a notorious criminal who wants to become famous. He is renamed as Charles Bronson by his fight promoter. He is born to a very respectable middle class family and becomes United Kingdoms most feared criminals and spends his entire adult life in solitary confinement. The movie is based on Peterson's life.CHARACTERS:There is no other big character in this movie other than Tom Hardy. Hardy plays this role with impeccable timing. His mannerisms induce laughter while his looks send chills down your spine. He is cool and some times innocent to look. He seems to be eccentric but he is so strategic in what he does. A very hard character to understand, Hardy just nails it. For the first 40 minutes or so you are left thinking "" uh is he mad or is he acting"". When he is injected with a sedative that when all his acting prowess is seen. Hardy is the glue that holds the movie together.THE MOVIE:The movie is not a masterpiece nonetheless a bad movie. It has its fair share of bad moments and good moments. For example Hardy gets naked many a times in the movie which is not comfortable to look. But when he is clad in suit he is mesmerizing. The director Nicholas Winding works his way establishing Bronson's character in a very fulfilling way but he fails to establish any other characters. The movie is not well paced, it feels fast at times and it drags at times. But, Hardy provides a solid performance that immerses you into the movie.VERDICT:The movie is a good entertainer only because of Tom Hardy's performance. It has his moments when Hardy wrecks havoc in the prison but falls short at places. But it is still a stylish refreshing movie with a reverberating performance from Tom Hardy.I go with 7 stars out of 10. Wort a Watch.",Bronson

141,klastaitas,It Felt Like 3 Hours,5,30 August 2021,"This film is so convoluted and horribly paced that I have no idea what it even attempted to do. Within the first half hour it feels like the movie should finish and it should because the next hour is just repetition with no character development whatsoever.Bronson (the main character) hardly develops throughout the movie. The most development he has is at the start, when he has a family and then turns to violence, then after that it's just violent outburst after violent outburst. The character is nearly developed when he is interested in art, but it results in nothing besides a violent outburst and an anti-climatic ending. I realise the character is based on real life and therefore can't always be exciting, but it could've been done in a much more satisfying way.After all this non-development, the film ends with a violent outburst (surprise, surprise) but for some reason it's meant be impactful and interesting and prove something but after so many meaningless fights the last one only results in boredom. Ultimately, the film fails at character development, plot and pacing.There is one good thing about it. And it's Tom Hardy's acting. It can't be ignored. It's astounding. If a film was ever to be carried by an actor, it would be Tom Hardy carrying Bronson. I think it's the only reason this film got any attention. The scenes on the stage, although it feels like meaningless padding, have some of the best acting I've ever seen. He's a convincing psycho. And he's the only reason this film is rated higher than four.Unfortunately, his performance doesn't make up for a pointlessly meandering, supposedly ""deep"", arthouse film. If you want a film that explores similar plot lines and themes watch John Mackenzie's ""A Sense of Freedom"" which, although still not great, accomplishes everything this film tried to.",Bronson

He truly has outdone himself with this performance, not one second do you doubt the deranged psychopath you are seeing.From start to finish, this film had me on edge. This guy is a truly remarkable and unpredictable character - I made a game out of guessing who Bronson wasn't going to bust up next. The film has many scenes that are not for the faint of heart, but what do you expect? Despite it's gritty style, it feels very artistic; The narration in particular is very unique and fits Hardy's interpretation of Bronson perfectly.It is filled with entertaining fights and conversations. The level of Bronson's lunacy is somewhat funny if you are willing to take it with a pinch of salt. The films weak point is lack of characters with any depth or likability. Besides Bronson, they don't really bother characterising anyone - most of the cast come off like a cardboard cut out.All in all, it's a solid drama/thriller about Charles Bronson, which is likely to entertain those who are not offended by violence or crime etc. If violence or blood makes you uncomfortable - it's probably okay to give this one a miss. 8/10.",Bronson

There was not one moment through the movie that I felt distracted or bored, to the contrary of that I did not want to blink so that I wouldn't miss one split of a second of Tom Hardy as Charlie Bronson. The movie did not try to give reasons or justifications of why Charlie Bronson was so self destructive, enjoyed violence and pain and preferred solitary confinement over freedom.There is no logic that you can wrap your head around watching Charlie Bronson portrayed by Tom Hardy, going to prison for armed robbery on a post office, receiving 7 years in prison and ends up being locked away for 34 years, 30 of which are in solitary confinement. You certainly will not find a rational explanation why he would suddenly take a hostage just so that he would start a confrontation with the guards, then strips naked and wait for them to come so that he would beat them up and eventually ends up overpowered, bleeding and in agony.The theatrical comic way which the director adopts in filming this movie helps to lighten the violence and brutality of Bronson yet it also helps bring to life his true nature and a depiction of what was going through his mind. I must say, I found myself laughing with confusion as Bronson prepares to torture these poor guards yet once again. Tom Hardy definitely put his heart and soul into this character, going all the way to stripping naked (full frontal), ramming himself naked into a dozen prison guards, sparing no small details to depict the real raw existence of Charlie Bronson. In the end you don't really know how to feel about Bronson, as he never committed murder though he had ample opportunities to do so which would imply that he might not be as evil as one would expect, at the same time his unexplained and un-triggered incline to violence wins your empathy as well as fear of him.",Bronson
145,darnbradley,Magnificent beast,9,10 November 2021,"Tom Hardy's best performance that I know of. Superbly written and directed. Kudos to all involved. Multiple viewings required. Funny, sad, violent, artistic, surreal.Quintessentially British.",Bronson
146,alexx1,One of the Best British Films I've seen!,10,17 March 2009,"Having known a minimal amount of the actual Charlie Bronson and his life in and out of prison didn't put me off seeing this film. Im not gonna bore you by telling you the complete story before I write anything like everyone else seems to think is 'the thing to do' so I'll get down to it.When watching Bronson at the Duke of Yorks cinema with the director coming down for a QnA my expectations were neutral. The film for me blew me away, it was gritty, violent, extreme and over the top which are all good things expressed in a story such as this. The visual elements of the film were both entertaining and approachable for analysing. The acting of Tom Hardy was astounding both through his performance and physical transformation he undertook.To see Bronson you will see an extreme story told within the psychological perspective of Bronson, the grit and drama of such a notorious inmate of his time the film is cinematically entertaining and a film well worth watching, as all he wants to do 'is be famous'.I would highly recommend the film to all but to be careful as the violence and other explicit nature isn't for the faint hearted or boring person.",Bronson
147,armythegn,Love letters should be kept between lovers...,5,18 March 2010,"First the positives: Tom Hardy puts in a very strong performance as the eponymous anti- hero, the cinematography is lush, one gets the very real sense that the prison officers are locked into the same futile game as Bronson himself, and the art teacher gives a real feeling of being a patronising d**k (hey, I'm 'down' with the cons, aren't I cool?). These positives are worth a 5/10.But then the negatives. About the violence, I'm really not worried - we see worse in any amount of action-film-by-numbers produced by Hollywood every year. It doesn't shock. It doesn't outrage (this is not a criticism, by the way). However, what I feel is really missing is an indication of what turns a boy from respectable family into ""Britain's Most Violent Offender (TM)"". True, the narration indicates that once in prison Bronson feels in his natural element - but what put him there in the first place? Why did he decide to commit a violent crime? Basically, for me an important back-story was missing.Secondly, I found the constant glorification of the violent side of Bronson's nature worrying. Again, not because of the violence itself, or what it says about Bronson's character, but actually about what it says about the film-makers'. They seem to be singing the ""o-o-o, I wanna be like you-o-o"" refrain. OK, so go and do it then if you're so clever, rather than seek second-hand gratification from the fear that this man has inflicted on many people. The film-makers seem to have produced a love-letter to their anti-hero. Almost as if what they really want is some kind of sordid affair with the man. Again, fine. But I don't really feel the need to have the film-makers' little fantasy presented to me.Lastly, I was hoping for an insight into the art of the man. In fact, for me, this is his potentially redeeming feature, something to make him human rather than a monster. But sadly his art is almost completely absent. True, there is a major focus on Bronson's life being his art, but I couldn't help feeling that perhaps there was more to be told about his creative process and its results. But then again, works of art aren't really art anymore, are they? In many circles the only art is performance art. For me, this made the character less rounded.To summarise, I almost liked this film. It is undoubtedly challenging, but what let it down was the film-makers' refusal to actually challenge their leading character. He faces no criticism for his brutal, bullying actions, and actually gains approval for them in a way that I feel certain would not be the case were the film-makers subjected to it themselves. And that is moral cowardice.",Bronson
148,Jnoirnoir1032,Danish delight,8,4 November 2011,"Nicolas Winding Refn proves yet again that he is one of the most interesting directors working today. In lesser hands this could have been all brawn, no brains or heart. His direction and the script allow Hardy to chew scenery, but never be anything less than absolutely captivating. The cheeky asides, that play out in Bronsons head to a live audience are well judged and add light relief to the dark subject matter. It's truly a great piece of work, and whilst not quite reaching the dizzying heights of Pusher 1 and 2, it certainly shows that Winding Refn is ready for the big time. Hardy, has since shown that he is a versatile and extremely talented actor, whose face can hint at so much energy behind the eyes. Simply brilliant.",Bronson
149,z-benkoudad,8/10,8,16 April 2017,"I've just watched this movie after the recommendation of some friends. I think Bronson is Tom Hardy's best performance ever !! I liked everything in the movie : the soundtrack, the point of views, the monologues, and even the silence in each scene. The director did a great job showing us in a theatrical way, the life and adventure of one the hardest to understand people in this world. I highly recommend it.",Bronson
150,Fire_Walk_With_Me_85,"Excellent acting, average film",5,26 January 2011,"Firstly let me say that my expectations were pretty high for this film. The story of Michael Peterson really interests me and I had heard Tom Hardy's acting was outstanding. Tom is, without a doubt, excellent. He looks the part, captures the intensity and the manic nature of Bronson really, really well.My issue with this film is that I feel Bronson was portrayed more as a bit of a violent nuisance and not a hell-raising, intense animal. A lot of the violent scenes seemed to be Bronson hitting a couple of guards and getting dragged off for a beating. I didn't get a feel for the amount of havoc he created. Also,I never really felt like the time-line of the film was made particularly clear so it seemed to be a series of event in very quick succession. No mention of the books Bronson has written, or of his intense work out routines in confined spaces.I did enjoy the film, it was entertaining and gave me a laugh. I would suggest watching it if you have an interest in the man himself or like a violent movie. However, don't expect the 'A Clockwork Orange of the 21st century'",Bronson
151,kmgibbs,It's a lock in you will remember,9,29 March 2009,"I have to say I am a big fan of Bob Hoskins type Brit crime flicks of the 70s and 80s; this film fits right into this mould. It has the same feel as Long Good Friday and McVicar, both excellent pieces of work; however it has the soul of a much darker piece, like Henry portrait of a serial killer. The film tackles the life of Britain longest severing prisoner, Charlie Bronson. However, Charlie has been in solitary confinement for most of this time, which poses the problem of how do you film this; where's the story? The tackling of this key issue is at the heart of this films strength. Rather than visit his cell, we visit his mind, which is a much more interesting place. This is really a study of character and the proxies for Charlie's mind are gripping and disturbing all at once. We cut between the real world and the world inside his head. If the prison is like McVicar, inside his head he is definitely a few Mcvities short. For he is best described as a nutter in the real world, almost childlike in how he processes the world: eat, sleep, love, fright then create art!. I was gripped throughout; the scenes were tight and well constructed. The use of the abstract theatre sections really took this to a different level of film and the central performance by Tom Hardy was fantastic and worth a few award nods. You can really see the budget at work here. This should have been better financed, as it could have done with a few more quid. That said it's this lack of budget that give the film its strong sense of style, akin to a one man play. However this makes it feel like a 1980's film not a 2009 film. The only thing I would criticise about this film is that it isn't as advertised. The marketing of this film seems to be more targeted to those who like films like Rise of the foot soldier or Essex Boys, when it should be more at the Clockwork Orange, Wicker Man (the original) crowd. I sat in the cinema with some young lads who were mostly confused by a complex journey into Bronson's minds, as they wanted to enjoy the violence handed down at the end of his fists. This is a great British film",Bronson
152,tomjtleslie,Better than expected,8,9 July 2018,"I was not expecting much from this film, but I didn't know that much about it. All I knew was what I'd seen on the cover and read on the back, and I wasn't too hopeful. But I was bored and had some time to kill and it was worth it. I just wanted a little background noise, but this was seriously intriguing. I couldn't look away.The actor in the lead role does a phenomenal job. I will have to check out more of his work. He should win an award or something! And I read this was a true story, so it makes it all the more intriguing! I will have to look it up.",Bronson
153,al-harris,"BRONSON - extremely violent, but a great movie!!!",10,5 January 2013,"BRONSON (named for the main character) is a fascinating study of a man's descent into madness. Tom Hardy, who plays Michael Peterson aka Charley Bronson, does an absolutely amazing job of acting as this brutal, masochistic lunatic who spent 34 years in the British prison system, 30 of them in solitary confinement. Whenever his life starts to move even a little bit toward normalcy within prison, Charley Bronson reacts almost involuntarily by exploding into bloody ultra-violence. The more guards they send to subdue him the better he likes it! Reminiscent of Fight Club and A Clockwork Orange, you'll enjoy this character study as long as you're not bothered by the violence.",Bronson
154,cinemapaperroast,Tom Hardy won me over with a brilliant performance!!!!,7,3 August 2020,"Bronson is worth putting in the time for no better reason just to witness Tom Hardy's extraordinary work.

155,regeneration-renewal,The almost-legend that is Charles Bronson gets an intriguingly empty dramatisation,7,30 January 2010,"""I'm gonna make a name for myself."" A quote more apt for Tom Hardy than Charles Bronson in this classic case of reputation and artistic interpretation outweighing the subject. Cleverly, Tom Hardy intensively injects a more in-depth characterisation of Bronson than the British wild-man really is. Though Bronson is certainly a character worth portraying, is his story a story worth telling? Refn parades his talent in this 'Oz' reminiscent, narrated prison drama and a notch on his belt for what may one day hail to be a future-cult classic. Meanwhile, lead man Tom Hardy continues to prove himself as a versatile character actor who's physical transformation for this role is nothing short of spectacular. An artistic dramatisation of a less than dramatic life, portrayed powerfully yet pointlessly. You come out of the film thinking 'Charlie Bronson is a mad b*stard...' but nothing more.The story follows the life of Charles Bronson, or Michael Peterson as is his real identity, and his bizarre rise to a sort of infamous anti-hero for small criminals everywhere. Starting his violence from a young age, 'Bronson' depicts how a man, caught for a menial offence', built his own reputation and made a unique rise to a pseudo stardom. Charles Bronson purposely made his life exciting by his extreme manners and continues to exaggerate his myth through over-rated media attention. The question begs, however, as to whether the man truly has a persona as interesting as brought to screen by Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy's performance is attention grabbing, gripping, and mentally taxing as you watch him explode. But your unable to love him or hate him – only ask, ""What's the point?"" An intriguing characterisation and beautifully creative depiction, but a tale that comes from somewhere and ends up nowhere. Possibly Refn should have waited a few years to see what old Charlie Bronson would do next with his eccentric prestige.It's debatable as to whether a film must have a moral direction, social influence or a definite plot-line, you do however need to leave with a sense of closure or a sense of expectation and Bronson leaves you with neither. Perfectly biopic but unexpectedly empty.Overall, an engaging movie for certain, with a performance of a lifetime and a shining example of modern British Film, no matter how irrelevant it may be.",Bronson
156,rawsoneagnew,One of the most interesting films ever made,10,27 March 2010,"I fully believe that this was one of the most interesting and jaw-dropping films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Being a United States citizen, worst off, being in Iowa, it was hard for me to find this film anywhere. I had watched the trailer for this film several times, and subsequently fell in love. After doing a little research on both the film and Charlie Bronson himself, I knew that I had to see this. And after watching it, I was not disappointed at all. The film is shot in a very interesting and unique way, with Bronson himself telling much of his story to a crowd of people. This biopic, of sorts, is a breath of fresh air from the usual mundane biopics that simply tell of somebody's life from start to finish. Tom Hardy does a terrific job of portraying the tormented Charlie Bronson, and I am anxious to see more of his work. The film is a real eye-opener, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to catch a different kind of film.",Bronson
157,jan1649,Bronson More Travis than Alex,7,30 November 2012,"The comparisons between ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Bronson"" are superficial at best. This compelling, character-driven piece shares far more with early Scorsese than Kubrick's horrifying dissection of dehumanization through violence.I thought more of ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"" as I watched it. Two reasons, mainly. 1)Tom Hardy: intense, charismatic, mugging and mad reminded me of a young De Niro as Travis Bickle with the animal ferocity of Jake La Motta (the theatrical framing of the story, use of music and editing, and difficult pathos of ""Raging Bull"" is echoed as well). 2)Bronson is not portrayed as a psychopath as Alex from ""Clockwork Orange"" clearly is. Bronson may be a sociopath or a narcissist, but he does have boundaries and a code of his own special sort that the film makes quite clear. Alex had no boundaries, no code, which was rather the point.Bronson, like Alex, Travis and La Motta, do share their inner- monologues, but there are sharp distinctions. Alex proves a shockingly reliable narrator who exposits his actions and experiences with intelligence and clarity, while Bronson's warped reasoning and lack of clarity reveal a profoundly unselfaware man with poor intellect like the confused Bickle and animalistic La Motta. And we see the world as he sees it, again as in many Scorsese films, and therefore we develop empathy for the character. On the other hand, Kubrick keeps us horrified and helpless spectators, separate from Alex and his senseless actions. We only find ourselves sympathizing for Alex when he is robbed of his only defining individual characteristic that renders him a powerless puppet unable to do either good or bad of his own volition. While Bronson was physically restrained, his will is never taken from him. He remains in control of his fate and individuality. The larger questions about the penal system, the society or upbringing that produced such a man, and all the implications of those questions are left largely untouched in ""Bronson.""While comparing ""Bronson"" to ""Clockwork Orange"" certainly is a good sales strategy, this visceral film is far from Kubrick both stylistically and thematically and in scale. But the unreliable narrator, subjective point of view, and character-driven plot are more closely related to what Scorsese picked up from Fellini and turned into a career. But, in the end, the film succeeds at being an interesting character study and worth a watch if only to marvel at Hardy's performance.",Bronson
158,peter_j_clark,"Definitely worth a watch, if only once!",7,31 July 2014,"So I bought this film on DVD mainly because it was on cheap, and also the script on the back sounded good. I would certainly recommend this as one to watch, even if it is a bit slow in places and certainly lacks the fighting action the back cover raved about! It gives a good look at the character behind the man, and Tom Hardy certainly lives up to the accolades regarding his performance. With this in mind, I would say borrow this film from a friend, similar to Clockwork Orange, you don't want to watch it again, certainly not for a good long time as it will just seem a little boring if you do! I did hear that Charles Bronson did actually watch this film and thoroughly enjoyed it which I think is sign enough!!",Bronson
159,mysticgypsyy,Not the best I've seen from Tom Hardy,4,10 February 2018,"I absolutely LOVE Tom Hardy, but this wasn't my fav role of his. To each their own I suppose, i do love his ability to commit to the roles he plays..i'm a die hard hardy fan & this wasn't bad, but also not so good. Kinda...meh?? Good job portraying Bronson though. Very interesting story.. Again, not my fav character hes played. I still love him as an actor. I really can't get enough of Tom lately. He's amazing in The Revenant, Dunkirk, The Drop, Mad Max & Taboo...to name a few. I love his attitude & looking forward to seeing many more of his movies & upcoming sequels to come.",Bronson
160,hospitalforsouls-61135,Bronson,8,21 September 2015,"Bronson is a film by a director I've slowly grown interested in. He reminds me of Lars Von Trier because of there fluid direction and usually engaging stories. Bronson especially exceeds with performances and passionate directing. The director's other work such as Drive and Only God Forgives are carefully crafted without much of a reliance on the story. Which I can ignore as long as other elements to crafting a film are done well. With acting, Tom Hardy gives a powerhouse performance and is easily the best part of the film. It's always enjoyable to see the characters he portrays in almost any movie. It's definitely some of Hardy's best work even with an exemplary track record. It's hard to keep your eyes off whether he's fighting nude in a claustrophobic jail cell or just being darkly comical. Which plays into more of the unique aspect of the storytelling.",Bronson
161,MarcoGallo97,A journey into the mind of a psychopath,10,27 July 2017,"Bronson is,in my opinion,one of the best Refn's movies. This one tell the story of Michael Gordon Peterson also known as Charles Bronson, the most violent British prisoner.I think this film can be considered one of the best biographical films ever made,the brilliant choice of the director to unite surreal scenes to the real facts turns out to be very good for the kind of story he wants to tell: the scenes set in a dreamlike and metaphysical theater in which the protagonist interacts with the spectator allowing us to fall into his madness. Unlike most of the films of this genre, who aspire to tell the story of a character presenting certain moments of his life, Bronson enters the spectator within the life and the view of the protagonist, in this case a violent psychopath, with scenes at Absurdity limit (just think of the already mentioned scenes of the stage of the theater or to the Tom Hardy voluntarily woody and rigid interpretation).I recommend this movie to all those who are looking for an ultimate enjoyment experience: everything from cast to soundtrack (digital versicolor is awesome), is perfect!",Bronson
162,nereamb-86991,Aesthetically perfect,9,7 November 2019,"The message of the film reminded me so much of the movie ""a clockwork orange"" but I felt like the aesthetics of the film were even better. Beautiful colors and film planes that are not very common to see nowadays. The role of Tom Hardy as Bronson is spectacular also, very well played",Bronson
163,etkkh,Sad really,9,9 July 2009,"Interesting movie, very charismatic, probably Bronson had too much personality for the law to handle.Am not exactly sure why Bronson is considered so DANGEROUS! Has he ever killed anyone? I don't think he has right ? The movie displays even more corruption amongst British police and system.I believe the movie was tamed down dramatically, I very much doubt Bronson could have escaped beating an officer without getting an absolute hammering.As for human rights, Bronson's where almost all breached.Fame is the least this guy deserves, a mentally troubled person, in the wrong environment which useless people to help will result in a trouble some person.I am glad Doctors are getting on to mental health and the issue is slowly being addressed.I know society requires a hate figure to excel in the right direction.But labelling people more dangerous and taking there one life away from them is not a forgivable crime.Hopefully Karma will strike down everyone who abused Bronson.1 life, 1 chance, to be taken away ? Unforgivable!",Bronson
164,lizwoodkibworth,WOW,10,17 June 2018,Tom Hardy shows his brilliance in this film. He he totally engulfed by the character and acts it out in believable craziness that IS Charles Bronson. Superb film that I think only Tom Hardy could have mastered so well. I keep watch it over and over as it's so psychologically fascinating. Seeing Tom Hardy totally naked is a bonus. Lol.,Bronson
165,lizwoodkibworth,Just fantastic.,10,25 June 2018,"This film is astounding brilliant and underappreciated but already has a sound reputation. I've watched it many times and each time I find more to think about. I'm not all about technicalities and don't claim to know how to best understand the directors, producers and many many others who are necessary for such a production. All I can claim is that I just know what I like as an innocent appreciator of what I see. Tom Hardy is amazing in his role as Bronson. As is purportedly said by Charles Bronson himself, nobody else could have played the part except Hardy. The way the film demonstrates Bronson's state of mind as well as his life story is extremely well portrayed. The music score is haunting, appropriate and wonderful. I love the way the film shifts from an almost innocent and seriously unique personality to a tragic comedian who is misunderstood. It highlights the terrible situations Bronson created by his antics, and also his vulnerability as a human being, his creativity, his individuality and his naivety. 
To everyone who contributed to this film, especially Tom Hardy for his amazing portrayal, thank you. I say this is the best film I've seen in a lot of years, 10/10 as far as I'm concerned.",Bronson
166,generaldilvry69,Self-indulgent Art,3,18 October 2019,"I had high hopes for this movie but its laborious strive to be artistic eclipses form, and is frankly unwatchable. Why should the audience care about the protagonist? Beyond the obvious, what is the point of telling this story? Does it really require 92 minutes to establish the obvious: prisoner ""x"":is sociopathic and violent?The fact of his circumstances (length of sentence) already presumes what the clip (yes, film or movie implies cohesion) sets out to show. In the end, if the point is that there is no point; that, madness just ""is,"" then the creators relegate themselves to their own nihilism.A better nihilistic would to forego this painful exercise all together and express their views by showcasing instead, a blank canvas as a ""painting"" portraying the post-modern off of faux deconstructuralism.",Bronson
167,poisongage,Bronson: An epic movie,10,20 June 2009,"Nicolas Winding Refn's best work since Pusher. No doubt.This is just as well done, but in it's own rights. The actor goes out of his way to adapt the mind and the physique of the character he is portraying. And the director goes out of his way to setup a scenery that makes Hardy's performance even more credible.I love this movie, particularly because of the intense feel of the story and the actor who portrays it. Tom Hardy delivers the performance of his career and so does Refn. A big kudos to them both.This is one of those movies, where those who get the point won't be hesitating to give it a 5/5 or a 10/10.",Bronson

169,ZeeBlakely,Hmmm is it too pretentious?,6,4 June 2011,"Okay so growing up Charles Bronson (not the actor) was a regular on in my dads copy of The Sun. When my dad brought it home we regularly looked through the days stories (I remember telling him that I liked to bash an apple before I ate it just because I read it in the 'letters' page and him telling me I read The Sun too much). So Bronson was part of growing up and we all used to say what a lunatic he clearly was! The film wasn't what I expected to be honest.Firstly I hated the sub indie music. Really annoying despite it being part of my so called formative years.Then the cut to camera dialogue which I found pretentious.What else? Well being a Londoner, liked the accent although clearly not from my SLAG (South London Aggro Girls) neck of the woods.The acting was good by lead character: top marks.However we do need to ask was Charles Bronson actually paid for this and if so how do you feel about that?",Bronson
170,SirDaz,A Wasted Opportunity,3,30 May 2009,"A film about the most violent man in the British Prison system really should have a lot more substance to it than this. For me this attempt is a meandering, self pandering effort.The over artsy theatre scenes (WHY?). The lack of a feeling of time (one minute it's 1974 and Bronson is doing an armed robbery, the next well you never have a clue, the narration says 24 out of 26 years in solitary then ending text says it was 30 out of 34) all just cause a sense of bemusement.This film has next to nothing to do with the man, little to do with violence and more to do with a director and cast attempts at making something so far from the subject that they should have picked something else.Bronson's story is a sad, harrowing and eye opening one. Having read biographies of the man which tell the story so much better I was left expecting far more from this movie.This film covers none of his motivations, it barely explains why he attacked the inmate in Rampton (the film gives you the hint that he was a 'nonce' by him mentioning a 9 year old, but if you weren't paying too much attention then you'd have no idea.) It wraps it all up into a neat ball of 'I wanted to be famous'. it tells in a very confusing and odd way the story of why he ended up back inside, according to this he stole a ring and that was that, in truth there was a lot more going on (sure stealing the ring was the crux of it, but this ignores all of what was going on.) All in all I'd say if you want to know more about this man then read one of the biographies, you'll learn a lot more and be far more 'entertained', this film is an overblown 'lovey' type experience.",Bronson
171,stewart-esq,Watchable but ultimately pointless.,5,4 October 2009,"This film is visually entertaining but ultimately does not achieve anything. It does not humanise Bronson, nor does it attempt to, and there is very little else in the way of psychoanalysing his life.There are also some scenes that don't seem to serve any point, particularly the scenes of him performing on a stage. This may be to highlight the idea that Bronson craves attention, but as with many parts of this film the intention is unclear.Bronson clearly wants fame, he got more of it with this film, he comes out of it looking like a hero. This film does not portray him as a man with any failings whatsoever, this is unrealistic, but more importantly it's untrue.Not a bad film really, and definitely worth watching if you're looking for a tribute film to a violent maniac.",Bronson
172,BauersApprentice,Pretty Darn Boring,5,6 March 2010,"This film is really for those people who actually want to understand the plight of Charles Bronson, if you are expecting a captivating, brilliant movie that will entertain you then I suggest looking elsewhere.I found it quite hard to stay interested in this movie throughout as while it is a story about Britain's most violent prisoner the movie seems littered with fight scenes every 5 minutes through the entire movie, and fairly unconvincing fight scenes at that. I suppose the flaw in this review comes from someone who was expecting something entertaining from this movie, whereas in reality we should all know by now that the majority of biographical films are pretty boring for the most part.Its easy to see why those who lambasted this movie as 'glorifying violence' did so, as this is pretty much the most common theme in the movie, seeing Charles Bronson get into a fight with prison guards or whoever is generally in his vicinity. However if the intention was to portray Bronson as the complete psychopath who gains satisfaction from beating people to a pulp and homoerotic activities then it very much succeeded.Personally, not the type of movie I take pleasure in watching, but on the whole, acting particularly (fight scenes apart) well made.",Bronson
173,commentary,Bronson.....one to watch more than once.,7,5 July 2010,"I watched this film with very little knowledge of who the man 'Charles Bronson' was - well, at least what had happened in his life, and how he had gathered the attention and the title of 'Britain's Most Violent Prisoner'.So I watched the film, and found that the first time around I could not place a firm verdict. This is one of those films that simply has to be watched more than once in order to be appreciated and understood.For me, the best way to understand the film is to watch the film with the understanding that it is told by Charles Bronson - so the way the film is presented is through his view of the world. After all, the film is presented by 'Charles Bronson' in a theatrical style, and is, at times, hard to watch, purely because his motives for his actions are sometimes not made clear. But one thing to justify this lack of clarity is that he is supposed to be a psychopath - his actions are justified by his craving to be famous in spite the consequences. By the end of the film, you do not really sympathise with the character, you are merely seeing into his world and his art, which is essentially killing or fighting, or acting out against authority in one form or another. This is why I have given it 7 stars - because you aren't really on Bronson's side at any point.However, Bronson is portrayed fantastically by the lead man, Tom Hardy, who plays the character so convincingly that it is hard to tell he is acting at all at times.Overall this film is well worth watching, and I can see the connection to the film 'A Clockwork Orange' made in people's minds, but if you watch the film for what it is, you are sure to enjoy it, as long as you embrace the storytelling of a madman for 90 minutes.",Bronson
174,Calliopurania,Absolutely brilliant!,9,6 August 2019,"This movie perfectly depicts the true depth of Tom Harry's talent and his willingness to dive deep into the characters he portrays. He completely loses himself in Bronson bringing to us, the viewers, an image of what Bronson might truly be like. This was an artistically insane, beautifully crazed movie I'll never forget.",Bronson

176,william-27772,The weirdness is what I love about this,9,25 April 2019,"This film is probably my favourite of all time. The performance by hardy is the most compelling and captivating acting you can get. He portrays the character of a slightly mental and spontaneous Bronson so well. Whether true to the real story or not this film is hilarious to me and full of greatly delivered lines that make my giggle just saying them. This film is also able to have a meaningful message about the loneliness and mistreatment that the real Bronson must have gone through.
Can't recommend enough",Bronson
177,nawaf-albader,Great acting OK movie,7,8 January 2019,It would've been a 4 or a 5 if it wasn't for Tom Hardy's acting some of his greatest work,Bronson
178,ivanliamingreatass,Wow 10 out of 10 amazing performance by Tom Hardy,10,28 July 2017,It is amazing very funny and entertaining and dark lot of great moments does kind of reminds me of a clockwork orange. Great performance and excellent story. The butter scene is hilarious and Tom Hardy is great. The bio pic of the worst prisoner in Britain based on true story. It is about a guy who robs a post office gets 7 years but because of bad behaviour and violence spends his whole life in jail.,Bronson
179,snimpy,Outstanding!,10,12 May 2010,"The director meant for this film to be a homage to A Clockwork Orange by Stanley Cubric. Cubric is one of my favorite directors of all time. It is a homamge and much more. It's a horrifying and unfortunately realistic view of the prison system of today. Apart from that, it's beautifully cut and directed. Tom Hardy is astounding and surprisingly realistic in the the leading role as ""Charlie Bronson"". The 80's music and realistic 80's scenery of the era weaves into the story, highlighting it perfectly. It is truly a work of art, by everyone involved in the making of this film. I'm at loss of words to describe the film experience of Bronson as a film student. It's a movie that's so rare in it's exceptional artistic quality that it will be part of the curriculum of film students for the next 40 years. If it's not -something has gone seriously wrong! The film -the acting, and the final composition of it is fantastic. Don't miss out. I'll be including this in my teaching of Film Studies for a long time!",Bronson
180,JakeFr,Bronson Review,7,23 July 2020,"Tom Hardy did a great job and the film was great fun, but it became quite repetitive over the 92 minute run time. Bronson's actions became quite predictable and didn't change as a character, but as this is loosely based on a real man's life, it makes since that we didn't see change. Film starts off as a 10, but ends off as a low 7.",Bronson
181,digitalinkwell,Genius on all levels,10,30 June 2015,"I expected a gritty prison drama, and what I got instead was a brilliantly directed movie that can only be described as a dark cabaret. Tom Hardy will never nail a role like he did here. He is intense yet playful, perfectly portraying a man that is neither good nor evil...just troubled.The violence, of which there is plenty, is handled very creatively. Sometimes with humor, other times set to incredibly powerful music that shows his inner turmoil.This movie is perfect.",Bronson
182,peppermintpatty5,Bronson,10,18 February 2020,Tom Hardy did an excellent job playing this role. Why he wasn't recognized is beyond me. He would have done a gone job playing the Joker. He is so versatile in his roles. He will win an Oscar or two in his life time.,Bronson
183,OwlCreekOccurrence,Director and Leading Man combine in an excellent expression of style.,8,13 March 2009,"Tom Hardy and Nicholas Winding Refn are the stars of the show here, taking the story of 'Britain's most violent prisoner' and twisting it into an explosion of style.Tom Hardy plays Michael Peterson who was initially incarcerated for 7 years after robbing a Post Office but this sentence turned into a 34 year stretch after numerous cases of violence in prison. Of these 34 years 30 were spent in solitary confinement. In his short period outside he assumed the fighting name of Charles Bronson after the Death Wish star. It is his alter ego which dominates the film.Hardy is magnificent, prowling around people almost growling, a hulking, brooding, unpredictable beast who almost doesn't care what happens to him, preferring gaol where his is someone to the outside where he is no-one.Many reviewers have been troubled by the lack of insight into the character of Bronson, however this is unsurprising as the story itself is narrated by Bronson himself, cutting back to a fantasy audience where he parades in varying levels of makeup, the star of his own show.Refn handles this material with aplomb, filling it with tracks and pans, the occasional slice of slow motion, an interesting and varied colour palate and impeccable taste in music. Kubrick and A Clockwork Orange have been mentioned in almost every review, but there are clear influences of Bertolucci, perhaps mostly The Conformist in its detached style and use of colour.By the time the film ends we are unsure who to feel sorry for, lost in a world of hard lines and constant violence. A very interesting film that marks out Hardy and Refn as exciting talents in modern cinema.",Bronson
184,slickato,God Awful,1,7 February 2013,"I like Tom Hardy as an actor and that is the reason I streamed this movie on Netflix. That was a big mistake! This should of never been released. If you want to see his junk through out the movie while walking around a cell the size of a 1/2 bath butt naked then this is for you. It cuts to scenes as him dressed as a mime in front of an audience telling his story, then back to the movie of his butt naked self walking around a cell. He is constantly fighting prison guards, he won't conform to anything. His life is totally miserable, why he wants to stay alive or why the prisons just don't put him out of his misery is beyond me. It was hard to watch, I could of easily turned it off.",Bronson
185,mat-ga,Bronson - A misguided fool - Bronson - British film making at it s best.,10,16 July 2009,"I was in no rush to see yet another glamorisation of another over the hill criminal, But I was shockingly surprised and confused at what I had just experienced as the credits rolled. The film definitely deserved another look.I have now seen Bronson a number of times and think it is master class piece of film making. Tom Hardys' portrayal as Bronson is excellent and captivating. I hardly recognised him from his role as Handsome Bob in Rock'n'Rolla. I found myself hanging of every word.While yes it is not acceptable to glamorise ""Britains' most expensive prisoner"", there was no glamour, what I saw was a portrayal of a below intelligence, misguided and confused individual.This is not a prison movie, this is not a gangster movie, this is a movie into the inner psyche of a mad man.I constantly keep hearing comparisons to Clockwork Orange and yes there are similarities as classical music plays a large part of the soundtrack. The craziness of the Clockwork Orange is also present in Bronson. But the character portrayed immediately reminded me of Chopper. The use of the Walker Brothers tune ""The Electrician"" at the start of the film was devastating and definitely warns you of what you are about to witness.This is not glamour and this is not Hollywood, this is dark, disturbed and very unsettling. A must see, Excellent.",Bronson
186,andyuk-4,Don't believe the hype,3,6 June 2009,"Where do I start? The film itself is quite entertaining, but when you add the ""based on a true story"" it becomes a twisted mockery.This was a great chance wasted, did the director really think people would swallow this sanitised Bronson? Take the hostage scene at HMP Hull.Read the reports, the court findings, even Bronson's own website. There was no paint, no apple,but there was a very frightened teacher who for 44 hrs thought he could die, threatened with a knife and led round like a dog on an improvised lead.As for the so called Asylum scenes I haven't laughed out loud so much in years. It takes the worst of One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, adds every schoolboy idea of a mental unit and again tries to pass this off as ""partially"" true.Well all I can say of this film is that if the aim was to massage Bronson's ego then job well done, but to do it at the expense of the victims of his violence is criminal in itself.",Bronson
187,mikey_waddy,"Bronson, the man with a movie",3,1 July 2009,"I noticed this movie being accredited as 'A Clockwork Orange for the 21st Century'. This may leave you with a high expectation that leaves you thinking, 'Post-Modern linguistics, stylistic persona's, and a scarily surreal maddening plot'. Unfortunately this isn't the case with Bronson.I don't think I'm spoiling it for anyone to gather an idea of the true story dilemma of one man; a prisoner insisting to break the rules in any area he can (Thereby creating his alter ego, Charlie). However, personality alone cannot stretch into a wondrous piece of cinema. Most characters development beyond Mr. Bronson is fatigued with a sense of deja vu. The 'oh I figured this under the radar movie would excel against the Hollywood rubbish that we see today'. Far from it. Expect the expected, all dancing, all singing, slightly patronising imagery that is Bronson.Let's suggest for a moment that this piece was aimed at being a purely 'sudo-intellectual-entertainment' concept. Well, it pales as there is a very minimal story to uphold, it's difficult to grasp the solitary moments, as so quick as he is found in this confinement we are reminded of his future/past experiences. You're left with a grit like cinematic filming that has been seen in much better formats like 'Snatch'.However, their are some good moments within the movie that could've be condensed into a much better 30 minute short film piece, if they weren't so concerned with trying to achieve the big bucks.",Bronson
188,omb_brighton,A wasted opportunity,2,10 July 2009,"I've been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time. The UK press love Charles Bronson so i thought a film about his life, his story would be excellent. Instead of basing it all on fact and making a decent film out of it, the director and production team decided to take the ""arty"" route which in my opinion just doesn't work at all. The bizarre scenes where he's standing on a stage wearing clown makeup and speaking to a crowd actually annoyed me. This arty feel works for films like Clockwork Orange but not a film about a real life prisoner. They had the opportunity to make a cracking film but blew it. The real life Charlies Bronson is obviously a very eccentric man who loves the press attention but the film just takes it one step too far. I'm hoping that any future production about Charles Bronson will concentrate more on facts and less on the arty farty nonsense.",Bronson
189,chris_hancy,Bronson may indeed deserve some sympathy but this movie surely does not,1,23 February 2010,"A movie made that really challenges preexisting ideas in film making? Or one that superficially pretends to do so?This movie is constantly compared with A clock work Orange. At the end of A clock work orange we are left with a strange desire for empathy for this social psychopath named Alex and loathing towards the ""big brother"" system which has taken away the liberties of free emotion from him - a dangerous concept. In Bronson the aim is exactly the same but without the same brilliance development of character and insight into the characters own and surrounding sociology or psychological insight - we learn nothing about the motives or creation of the Bronson psyche. so We can not empathize with him.The creation of Bronson appears as a shallow copy of pre- existing formulas -mentally ill are shown in all cliqued glory - each scene is Kubric , without Kubric being the one directing. Comparisons to the Australian ""Criminal cultural idol"" Mark Brandon ""chopper"" Read are numerously made. There is no comparison- We see Chopper as a real violent psychopath - but we also see the almost redeeming cleverness and psychology in him - we see the creation and effect of his charisma the power of it - but we also get a chance to see its fallacy and his own weakness in character, in the times that fail him , we are shown his blatant lust for fame and that his physical presence and ""gift of gab"" as a mask of his own insecurities and there we may emphasize with him as he appears as a small scared little boy. We see also to some degree the inner social workings inside the Australian prison System between the inmates themselves and the wardens - we see the hierarchy in effect. we also see this insight when Chopper is ""outside"". In Bronson We do not .The fact that one movie is Realistic and one is not then does not become an issue. Bronson is superficial movie making in all senses of the word. Bronson is churned out following every institutional clique after another here you do not see a movie directed by a brilliant individual or the acting of any brilliant individual or the creativity , but you see the regurgitation of textbook theories on film making - a movie created by a university without real depth or soul or understanding or individuality, Bronson is asked what does he want? Bronson answers ""What have you got"" ""What are you rebelling against Johnny? ""what have you got?"" -Rebel without a causeWhat do you want? ""What ever you have"" - BronsonThis film is a travesty to real creative film making and just must not be applauded for being so. It is a Tarantino movie without Tarantino's original vision which excuses his cut and paste style.a Tarantino movie has more subtlety in showing its influences and individual vision than this tripe. Tarantino movie takes ideas and contexts and puts them in new combinations or awareness, for example; the western gunslingers, or samurai/kung fu warrior are shown in new situations; now they are blended and in the playground of women in kill bill. Or presence of philosophically or socially comedic criminals in Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, even Inglorious Bastards in being such an obvious display of thoughtless entertainment is in a way credible in its awareness of being so. But here no similar new combinations or relevations occurin here. Bronson is a psychopath who goes into a criminal system and comes out and we the viewer ar asked to side with the criminal -nothing new there - its based on a true story so there is not really much creative freedom available to be experimented with plot wise. So the creators of this film should be under the obligation as self respecting ""creative people"" to experiment though other mediums than plot vehicles. but as we see this done in the film of the same subjects ""Chopper"" REALLY we do not gain any new insight or experience anything result of creative expression from watching this film. we don't even gain the simple indulgence of thoughtless entertainment that we can gain from a Hollywood block buster because this film pretends to be something else; it pretends to be groundbreaking and artistic. Perhaps it is the actual intention of this movie - to show the viewer how the guise of artistic credibility can be used to cover a superficial and pointless work to an artistically ignorant viewer. If this is the case then this movie is in fact Genius, but for some reason i suspect this is not the case, and is an example of the perpetration.Any display of the initiative required to make a movie in the first place is always applaudable. but we seem to be applauding this fact alone which blinds us to look at the actual validity of this movie in its heart and soul. It really is a pity that what was made was such a display of institutional brainwashing comparable to that which occurs in Hollywood, but without the honesty of being what it is.I cannot help but feel the scarce monetary funding available from government grants and awarding bodies to support young filmmakers could have been used much more wisely to support for more deserving and creative young players in the independent film industry. Young talents whom really risk new boundaries and challenge our preexisting views in society. Those directors and film makers whom question us the viewer through their work maintaining our loyalty and acceptance of the new ideas through mastery and skillful use of the film medium. Not those whom take an easy and pointless route embarking on constant immature and superficial quests for glory, recognition and cool-status from those still wishing to achieve the same thing themselves.",Bronson
190,istvan-828-816795,This movie is barely watchable,1,26 September 2011,"There are good movies about prison and prisoners eg. The Shawshank Redemption, Natural Born Killers, Felon and so on. Everybody has a favorite one, I guess. This movie is just plain wrong from the beginning till the end. Pure violence without the least value added, illogical characters, zero story, just a bunch of shots after each other, like a newbie is trying to make a movie without a concept. Do not waste time on watching this crap, it is not worth the time and the money. I would classify it as one of the biggest failures of prison movies. :( I don't understand how could it get such a high score on IMDb. :)",Bronson
191,webandofbrothers,My most favorite repeaters,9,16 October 2010,"This has got to be one of my most favorite films of the past couple of years if not more. The amount of insanity this film presents is exquisite!. One of the things I love about this film is the importance of color within the scenery. For example, when Charlie is in prison we see this extreme vibrancy of color, but when he is moved to the funny farm, the color is drained away. With Charlie narrating this film, we can see this as his emotions toward the facilities. He is at peace and to some extent, in control while in prison, but when he is in the loony bin or out in the real world, everything is lit up and dulled in hue showing them as grayer times for our little brawler. Don't get me wrong, the color in these scenes are still beautiful, they just switch, for example, from deep blue to baby blue.Another piece of this puzzle I love is Tom Hardy's portrayal of good ole Charlie. To me, Charlie seems like a symbol of anarchy. He does whatever he wants at that moment but over all, he has no idea what he wants. This is presented best in the last bit of the film after he's taken Andy Love hostage. When the warden asks what his demands are, Charlie can give him nothing, and when fully confronted with the question, he shuts everything off and retaliates. This little piece of him helps give Hardy's character some sense of humanity. If it weren't for this, Charlie would probably come off as too unimaginable a character. It's good to know that, despite his beast like behavior, he still feels.For me, this is one of those films that I can watch over and over again and never get tired of it. There was one time when I watched ""The Road."" It was one of those films where you felt dead inside after seeing it, much like the book it is based on (This is not a dis to McCarthy. I'm sure your a master of the pen). So I watched Bronson right afterward, and I was filled with a new love of life. It was like Nicolus Winding Refn came into my room, sat atop my bed, brushed the hair away from my face and said, ""everything is gonna be alright baby bird."" I may not know anything about the real Charlie Bronson, but in this film, Charlie is an artist and a madman which comes together in holy matrimony.",Bronson
192,Postmaan,Clockwork orange?.....kinda...,6,31 March 2011,"Well,this film was...interesting. I have to say, i didn't think Tom Hardy was that great of an actor, before this film. But, i found out, that he is quite acceptable. Not THE best, but he fit the part. The part of a lunatic. He put his all into this role, as anyone could see. But even with his acting, the movie was....alright.Nothing I've never seen before. I mean, the clockwork orange has a very similar story.I'm not gonna say its an exact copy, because it isn't. The clockwork orange was a better film, in my opinion. But, thats besides the point.Im going to talk about the ending. No spoilers here. Nothing to be fearful of! I just want to say, that this film's ending, was kind of crap. I mean, it makes you feel that this whole movie, was never going somewhere. It feels...irrelevant...that's the word, irrelevant.So, i give it a 6 out of 10...almost a 7. But, the ending killed it for me.(6=Average)",Bronson
193,glosski,Hardy Owns This Role,10,23 April 2011,"Tom Hardy owned this role; he was absolutely astounding in his ability to sink his teeth into this leaving no room for anything but the character to shine out. This isn't a ""once upon a time..."" type of movie. There are no excuses offered, simply explanation of one mans way of life. To imagine 30 years in solitary and then see the madness in Tom Hardys eyes takes you into the world of Charlie Bronson. The images and methods used by the movie maker provide interesting twists in a twisted tale and leave you wondering while not obsessing about some of the personal aspects of this characters life. All in all, time well spent by the audience and a definite stepping stone for Hardy.",Bronson
194,pedromoscardini,Gorgeus,8,19 June 2014,"Excellent, great history, but the main point of the film is the camera, the games they play with the scenes and Bronson himself as a teller of his story in the movie. Great movie, the actor, don't know the name, is an A plus in demonstrate angriness, sarcasm an madness in essence. The film could, instead, be more realistic in some aspects, as Bronson suffers serious injuries he could be with some scars or be added it to him in the course of the movie. -Finally, to Brazilian readers, is a great movie that you will love, the reality of British jails are nowhere near the reality of ours, but it is a great movie thus, the madness and the pursuit of fame adjunct with the smarts of Bronson are great. Besides said before, the actor, despite all negatives specs can generate a certain feeling of empathy.",Bronson

Reminiscent of De Niro in Raging Bull or maybe Gary Oldcman in Sid and Nancy he goes as far as any actor i have ever seen in portraying a real life sociopath. He quite literally is Bronson. The problem is that the film literally goes nowhere. Refn's direction uses little narrative and way to much art for arts sake imagery. With very little insight into Bronson's life or motives he is presented as a seriously violent man who just happens to like fighting. The film does'not glorify violence as such, (the outbursts seem to punctuate fairly pointless attempts at art) it just presents Bronson as a violent man. I found it very frustrating that i knew just as much before as after about him and that kind of misses the point of a biopic. Still Tom Hardy rocks.",Bronson
196,bridgesjoew,Brilliant depiction of a violent man's life story. Tom Hardy excels.,8,13 January 2016,"Apart from presenting Tom Hardy in one of the most brilliant, beautifully expressive acting gigs of his career, this movie displays a violent, true-events-based story through much powerful storytelling. By having the main character tell his own life story out to a full theater audience and, in doing so, become the narrator for the audience on the other side of the screen, the script manages to break down the violent tale into chunks, giving us room for air, meanwhile a rather exciting and invigorating version of Bronson entertains us with pure theatricality. The combination itself is such a strong concept, it enriches the film to a higher level. Nicholas Winding Refn is one genius director and screenwriter–and Tom Hardy is a complete delight!",Bronson
197,swatson9-531-937178,Brilliant? No. No it is not.,2,3 August 2014,"I cannot believe the praise heaped on this movie that tries to be too many things at once and fails at them all. It fails as: a) a serious biopic, b) a black comedy, c) an homage to Kubrick/A Clockwork Orange. Hardy is a fine actor (or this would be a 1 star review), but the tone is all wrong and far too many scenes were uncomfortably hard to watch. The attempts to elicit humor were cringe-worthy. After it was over, I realized I would have much rather seen a serious documentary of Bronson. However, if you really want to see an insane person play with his feces and/or you really love Tom Hardy and want to see his junk flopping around then this may be the movie for you.",Bronson

I will not argue that this is a qualitty production, because it is, it has good music, a very talented actor and all it needs, but the story is just...it's just non-sense. That's what this movie is: non-sense. It doesn't deliver any kind of message, any kind of emotions (maybe boredom), it doesn't actually have any storyline. Charles Bronson's live is no more interesting or entertaining then that guy in the mental illness institution who was defecating in his own hand and then goes ahead and eats it.

I think Tom Hardy's a Great actor but this is a horrible movie, And I think that if it had been publicized better it would've ruined his career. If your fan of movies like fight club then you won't like this movie... If you like a clockwork Orange you will love this movie... I tried desperately hard to like this movie but there were so many times where there were several minutes of no dialogue and only one camera angle it almost put me to sleep. I think if they had tried to make the story more true to life it would've been a lot better.

200,lowxnxcold,Underrated...,9,15 April 2014,"I watch a lot movies, a lot of independent film, and all of the good blockbusters i can find. This movie is insanely underrated. If you go Tom Hardy's page on this site it says his breakthrough performance in ""inception"" (one of the most overrated and overly convoluted movies of all time) is what catapulted him to fame and recognition. BS, inception was an action movie, this is brilliant. But it's not just Tom's performance that makes this film as good as it is. The story structure is immaculate and seamless, and the director managed to maintain a very dark and sinister tone throughout the entirety of the film. To be fair though the film industry is a popularity contest and the people who really deserve recognition rarely get it. David Lynch, though recognized, has never won an Oscar and his movies get an average rating of 7 from users on this site and others, which again, for me, is mind boggling. So don't be surprised if you find yourself enjoying this movie as much as I did, and having you're friends ask you why.",Bronson

Well Im glad my facial hair and chrome dome look put me on the journey to discover Bronson. Tom Hardy gives a daring performance. A non-stop, bizarre, punch-drunk hallucination will have you laughing and crying. His intensity, energy and superb control over his craft will earn Hardy accolades in Hollywood in years to come.

202,KubrickFan_1,Tom Hardy at his very best...,8,27 January 2016,"This movie is easily one of the most impressive I have seen in years! Tom Hardy's performance (whom I already knew as an excellent actor) is stellar and so mesmerizing that he would have you believe he is Michael Peterson AKA Charles Bronson.Even knowing Mr. Hardy's versatility, it is still incredible to see how he manages to constantly transform himself to the point of being unrecognizable. The fact that the man he is portraying was himself in awe of the metamorphosis undertaken speaks volumes to his talent and dedication.On a side note, I was just as pleasantly surprised by Nicolas Winding Refn's direction here (alas, perhaps not quite to the same extent), as I had seen his more recent movies (Drive, Only God Forgives) and it feels good to know that he already was a promising talent at this point in time.If you are a fan of the ""A Clockwork Orange"", I highly recommend this movie, it's the only other film remotely similar in creating a lasting impression on your mind - forever. I have been waiting for something like this for ages, now it's here and boy is it good! The only reason I did not give it more stars is perhaps the lack of a bigger picture here, but that's fine, as the movie is not particularly aiming at forwarding a message here, only to attempt and chronicle the life of Britain's most violent prisoner and it does so perfectly.",Bronson
203,benwoodard-23808,"Tom Hardy, the role of a lifetime, the direction of a day.",5,17 January 2018,"For my first review on IMDb I thought it would be for a film I truly loved, instead it is for this film. This is a film for which I can only describe as a let down. After watching Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Taxi Driver'-esque neon infused drama 'Drive', I decided to watch this film, one which I had been told a lot about. Yes, Tom Hardy is brilliant in this. He is the glue that holds this poorly structured, weakly written film together. Four of my stars are for the main man here. Tom Hardy is outstanding in this role, he perfectly portrays the maniacal and incredibly unhinged Charles Bronson, a man who has infamously been incarcerated for life in prison, despite not officially murdering a single soul, as the film may make you think. His insane outbursts bring a certain perverse glee to the viewer, yet it is a glee that is severely stricken off when he calms down, and becomes a dull narrator for the parts of his life that no one cares about. The other star is for the music. Like in most Winding Refn films the music is amazing. A haunting ambient music strikes the audience,and inter cut with Hardy's surreal pantomine-type interactions with an (imaginary?) audience, the film will chill to the bone. However it is perhaps too loose on story, and too weakly structured for a casual viewing, and more one for those with a deeper interest in Britain's 'most expensive inmate'. 5/10",Bronson

A story about a big guy, whose hands are smarter than his brain is nothing new, but the way the story was told is something really exceptional, not to mention that Tom Hardy's acting and violence go together as omelet and ketchup. You may not be getting the sensation or the quality that you might get from Kubrick's portfolio since the movie's not a cinematographical masterpiece, but on the other hand, the story will literally eat you inside out, with a great protagonist whose criminal behavior is as violent as it can get.",Bronson
