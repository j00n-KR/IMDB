0,TheLittleSongbird,Superb!,10,8 May 2009,"I could not fault this movie whatsoever, and I am shocked at the low rating. The animation is jaw-dropping, especially in The Plagues scene, which is still for me visually and musically one of the most haunting and evocative scenes in an animated film, and the part with the Red Sea splitting. The songs and music(by Hans Zimmer) are phenomenal. ""When You Believe"" is a standout, as is the title song. People complained about the story. There is nothing wrong with the story at all, other that it is complicated, but it is a biblical story after all. The voice talents are superlative, here we have Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Steve Martin and Martin Short voicing fairly complex and beautifully-drawn characters flawlessly. I tend to worry about A Listers in animated films, but this, people, is a truly talented voice cast, who are truly excellent when they are given a good script, which was exactly what they got. All in all, a superb animated film, which isn't to be missed. 10/10 Bethany Cox.",The Prince of Egypt
1,SnoopyStyle,good animation and a serious treatment of the material,7,13 June 2015,"DreamWorks does The Ten Commandments. It's an adaptation of the Book of Exodus. The Queen finds a baby in a basket floating in the Nile and adopts him naming him Moses. Moses grows up along side Ramses as brothers and best of friends. However Moses' past would lead them on their separate paths. It builds to the climatic parting of the Red Sea and quickly ends with Moses coming down Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments.It's a good looking animated movie. The CG scenes give the animation an epic scale. It treats the material seriously. It is still animation but it keeps the needed adult themes. As for music, the songs are Broadway-like but none of them are memorable. Overall, this is a deserving rendition of the biblical tale.",The Prince of Egypt
2,Hitchcoc,Very Well Crafted Animation,8,7 September 2017,"This is quite a good telling of the Moses myth from the Bible. Moses is a multidimensional character who is given a task so incredibly great that he can't help but stumble a few times along the way. The first part is interesting in that it sets up a battle of two strong men. When Moses comes to realize his responsibility to the Hebrew people, he is saddled with complaining, misbehaving, and all the things that take place where humans are involved. There are several striking scenes here which the animators have done fabulously. At times the dialogue is a bit stilted due to attempts to create a kind of biblical English.",The Prince of Egypt
3,lee_eisenberg,And then what happened?,5,25 July 2019,"OK, everyone knows the story of Passover. ""The Prince of Egypt"" obviously wasn't going to be anything profound. It deserves credit for depicting the characters as swarthy, as the people in ancient Egypt most likely would've been (by contrast, most movies based on Bible stories cast white people). Of course, the common joke is that after the Hebrews - is it too early to call them Jews? - escaped from Egypt, nothing bad ever happened to them again (OK, sarcasm off). The idea is that they wandered the desert for forty years because men don't like to ask for directions.Basically, the movie is what it is. Essentially harmless, if generally corny.And the cast. We have here Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover (who had also appeared in DreamWorks's other animated feature that year, ""Antz""), Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin and Martin Short. In other words, it stars Jim Morrison, Lord Voldemort, Catwoman, Miss Congeniality, Ian Malcolm, Roger Murtaugh, Capt. Picard, Queen Elizabeth, and two of the Three Amigos. Ofra Haza was an Israeli pop singer who died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 2000.",The Prince of Egypt
4,jboothmillard,The Prince of Egypt,6,14 September 2009,"I had seen a trailer for this animated feature from DreamWorks productions, I knew the basic story, and one or two of the stars providing their voices, I just had to watch it. Basically years ago Pharoah Seti (Patrick Stewart) commands all male Hebrew babies by drowned, and a desperate mother places her's in a basket, going down to the river, to be found by the Queen (Dame Helen Mirren). Years later, Moses (Val Kilmer) has grown up as brother and heir to the thrown Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), but they are to be split when Moses discovers his true heritage. After fleeing the city, Moses finds himself living with the Hebrews, and then he is spoken to by God, who gives him the task as the messenger to bring freedom to the Hebrews. So Moses tries to make Ramese see sense and free his people, and as long as he keeps refusing, Egypt will be plagued by a number of curses, including the sea turned to blood, frogs and locusts all over the place, etc. Eventually, after the death of his son, Rameses allows the people to have their freedom, only to be charging towards them with his army, and they only get away when Moses drives his staff into the Red Sea and parting the water, a cool scene. Also starring Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Jeff Goldblum as Aaron, Danny Glover as Jethro, Steve Martin as Hotep and Martin Short as Huy. The cartoon may have a similarity to Disney, but it is still very good, combined with a little computer animation, an intriguing biblical story. It won the Oscar for Best Song for ""When You Believe"" - sung by Pfieffer, and released with singers Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey (it was also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Music for Stephen Schwartz and Hans Zimmer. Good!",The Prince of Egypt
5,ccthemovieman-1,"Good Artwork, Good Story",8,6 July 2006,"The story of Moses is done here and, although not totally Biblically accurate, this is about as close as it gets in Hollywood. The inaccuracies are minor.The artwork was fabulous when it came out in 1999. It's still very good, but animation has improved so fast in so short a time period that this is nothing special, art-wise, these day. However, it sure was when it was released just seven years ago. It's just beautiful in parts. Some of the prettiest colors I've seen on film have been in animated movies the last decade, and this is a prime example. The parting of the Red Sea in here is awesomely-done by the artists. That scene also sported the best sound in the 99-minute film.The songs in here were nothing special but they didn't detract from the story because they were all short. Regarding the story, I only wish they had gone into detail on the plagues instead of just lumping them all together. They could have had some jaw-dropping scenes with the locusts, etc.All-in-all a fine film and a rarity: a Biblical film that doesn't offend anyone.",The Prince of Egypt
6,ma-cortes,"Classy and evocative tale that hits all the marks and deals with Moses , the Hebrew lawgiver .",7,24 December 2012,"Spectacular cartoon adaptation about known story , it focuses Moses , the Hebrew leader , leading the Jews out of Egypt and realized in musical style . This is the wonderful story about an extraordinary man receiving a holy calling , and follows his life from birth , abandonment , slavery and trials in leading the Jews ; this is the greatest event in cartoon motion picture history . Biblical story developed in on an animated great scale though no such as the classic Cecil B. De Mille's version . An Egyptian prince named Moses (Val Kilmer provides a voice for both Moses and God, Charlton Heston also played both parts in classic adaptation) who is adopted and brought up in the court learns of his identity as a Hebrew and later his destiny to become the chosen deliverer of his people . This vivid storytelling although fairly standard follows appropriately the Moses'life , the son of a Jew slave, from birth and abandonment on a basket over river Nile , as when the Pharaoh Seti (voice by Patrick Stewart) ordered the killing of all newborn babies , being pick up by Egyptian princesses and he's raised in the royal court , becoming into Prince of Egypt . One time grown-up Moses embarks a supernatural mission , as the Egyptian Prince , learns of his true heritage as a Hebrew and his divine mission as the deliverer of his people , getting the freedom for Hebrews . When his Hebrew origin is revealed , Moses is cast out of Egypt , and makes his way across the desert . Then , Moses retires out of Egypt where meets Jethro (voice of Danny Glover) , marring him with his daughter Sefora . The stoic Moses along with his brothers Aaron (Jeff Goldblum) and Miriam (voice of Sandra Bullock) confront Pharaoh Rameses (voice of Ralph Fiennes who was considered for the title role of The Saint, which went to Val Kilmer) . Moses asks Pharaoh to liberate them but he refuses, causing the Egyptian plagues : invasion of locusts , fogs , epidemic , water become in blood and death of the first-born . As Moses instructs the slaves to put lamb's blood above their doors for protection and in the night , the angel of death comes , and passes over the protected doors . In the homes of the Egyptians where there is no protective sign , the angel kills off the first born children of Egypt, including Rameses' son . Moses goes to his brother after this , and is given permission to take the Jews . Moses takes charge of God's people and wrests them from Pharaoh's punishing grip . Moses like liberator of the Jewish leads his people throughout desert battling enemies and with holy intervention (when Moses and God are conversing, Val Kilmer is actually talking to himself) . Finally , Moses climbs the Mount of Sinai bringing the holy tablets , meanwhile Jewish people worshipping the golden calf .This is a monumental animated version of the Biblic book of ¨Exodus ¨ with drawings carried out in utter conviction and impressive special effects , including the computer generator parting of the Red Sea ; in spite of making by means of usual C.G. ,the effects still look great . The production team conferred with roughly 600 religious experts to make the film as accurate as possible . Sadly , the movie was banned in Malaysia and Indonesia , but later released in Video CD format . Lavishly produced by Dreamworks , the Production Company created by Jeffrey Katzenberg , David Geffen and Steven Spielberg . Producer Jeffrey Katzenberg constantly pitched the idea to the Walt Disney Company while he was working there , but Michael Eisner didn't like the idea . Obviously changes were made to the story to make it work as an animated feature , in fact , there is a short list of differences between the movie and the Biblical account of the Exodus . This movie was the most expensive animated feature ever made at the time, being beaten out by Final fantasy . However , the film being necessary to see it in big screen , watching in TV it makes lost most really spectacular scenarios on the small screen . The picture is suitable for family viewing and religious people. Other adaptations told in compactly form about this biblical story are the followings : classic mute (1923) by Cecil B. DeMille with Theodore Roberts , Charles Rochefort ; the second handling and the greatest , made in a gargantuan scale by Cecil B. DeMille (1956) played by Charlton Heston , Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter , Debra Paget , John Derek , Edward G. Robinson and Vincent Price . Furthermore , TV rendition (1975) by Gianfranco De Bossio with Burt Lancaster , Irene Papas and Anthony Quayle , a new take on titled ¨In the beginning¨ (2000) by Kevin Connor with Billy Campbell as Moses , Christopher Lee as Seti and Art Malik as Rameses . And television rendition (2006) by Robert Dornhelm with Dougray Scott , Susan Lynch , Naveen Andrews , Paul Rhys , Omar Sharif , Linus Roache among others .",The Prince of Egypt
7,JohnHowardReid,"Not exactly Biblical, but a great story anyway!",8,17 February 2013,"A movie that cost a staggering amount of money (upwards of $70 million) and was lucky to just break even after paying distribution expenses. For some unknown reason, the script makes a large number of deliberate boners that will probably infuriate the Bible set. The first, of course, is that here we have a very well-spoken Moses, not a man that needs his brother to do his talking for him. This raises the second boner. As Aaron is not needed to do all the talking, his role is reduced even further. Aaron doesn't front up to Pharaoh. In fact, in this picture, Aaron doesn't come face to face with Pharaoh at all. And what's all this stuff about Moses being friends with Rameses? They were never boyhood chums. Moses was adopted by one of his daughters, not by Rameses himself or his dad. The way Moses is pictured is also rather odd. He doesn't look particularly Jewish, but I guess we'll have to pass that one. As it's traditional to picture Jesus as a Gentile, why not Moses as well? However, the picturization of Jethro as an overblown Santa Claus figure is really way over the top. And the uncredited voice of God is atrocious. God doesn't speak that way. Read the Bible. Moses is fearful at first, but then he settles himself down sufficiently to ask God a cunning question, namely what was His name. Moses was taught at school that if you knew a person's name, you could gain control over them. But – as the 20th century's finest Bible scholar, Father Alexander Jones, points out in The Jerusalem Bible – God is a wake-up to Moses's ploy and fobs him off with a jocular ""I am who I am!"" Now for the movie itself. True, if it's taken out of its biblical context, it is exciting, tuneful, breathless, staggering and even inventive. Definitely a must-see! In fact, you really need to see it through at least twice on the superb Dreamworks DVD (which also has lots of fascinating extras),",The Prince of Egypt

First, as Amon Goeth, in ""Schindler's List,"" and now as Ramses, the pharaoh who wouldn't let the children of Israel depart from Egypt.Gone from this production is Nefertiti as well as the Hebrew overseer Dathan. How could the story be told without these two central figures?The songs are just lovely. In this version, pharaoh is not immediately angry with his brother Moses. Also, the expulsion of Moses from Egypt is self-imposed.Nevertheless, the basic elements of the story remain and are beautifully depicted.",The Prince of Egypt
9,sunwarrior13,The Prince Of Egypt Is An Epic Animated Musical,10,24 September 2012,"The Prince of Egypt is an epic animated musical produced and released by DreamWorks Animation. It is an adaptation of the Book of Exodus and follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt. It was directed by Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells and Steve Hickner. It featured songs written by Stephen Schwartz and a score composed by Hans Zimmer. The film has taken the biblical story of Exodus, put it into cartoon form, and released it on the big screen as an epic animated feature.It tells the story of Moses releasing the Jews from Egyptian slavery under the hand of the evil pharaoh Rameses. The story revolves around these two close brothers, Moses and Rameses. While Rameses is groomed to take over the land, his beloved brother Moses is a carefree prankster, until he learns the true secret of his past. His secret, of course, is that he is really a Jew and as a child was floated down the river to escape mass genocide. The pharaoh Seti raised Moses as his son. Upon learning the truth of his past from a burning bush, Moses returns to Egypt with God on his side and demands that the pharaoh (now his brother Rameses) must ""Let my people go."" The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable as well as more humanly knowable.The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent.Finally,it is an inspiring translation of biblical grandeur, turning the story of one of history's greatest heroes into an entertaining, visually dazzling animation.",The Prince of Egypt
10,zardoz-13,An Admirable Animated Opus,9,16 December 2014,"As DreamWorks' first animated musical, ""The Prince of Egypt"" qualifies as an astonishing account of the Exodus epic from The Bible that rivals the 1923 and 1956 versions of Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments."" This four-years-in-the-production, PG-rated, 99-minute spectacle covers the life of Moses from his birth, treacherous voyage in a floating basket down the Nile River to his emergence from the mountain clutching the 10 commandments and it commands attention. You won't see animals or architecture deliver dialogue and the filmmakers play everything in a straight-forward fashion. Unlike most adolescent opuses, this film boasts far more substance than you'd expect from an animated movie. Co-directors Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells approach their subject matter with reverence as reflected in the Angel of Death sequence. The lethal spirits pass up doorways and lintels splashed with blood, but eliminates families that didn't put blood at the entrances to their homes. Young and old alike should enjoy this gorgeous-looking film. The authoritative voice over cast of Val Kilmer as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses, Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Patrick Stewart as Seti, Helen Miriam as The Queen, and Jeff Goldblum as Aaron is as evocative as it is charismatic. The animation is tour-de-force, and the Red Sea sequence stand out. You won't forget ""The Prince of Egypt.""",The Prince of Egypt
11,Boba_Fett1138,"Beautiful and powerful. ""The Prince of Egypt"" has taken animated movies to a new level.",9,7 October 2005,"""The Prince of Egypt"" is a surprisingly near perfect movie. The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast.Animated movies has been taken to a new level with this movie. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie.The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail.Another wonderful about his movie is the music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige.With this movie DreamWorks showed for the first time that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience.It's a great movie for all ages but mainly adults.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Prince of Egypt
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I always thought what the Bible needed was singing and slapstick,7,1 May 2012,"Moses(Kilmer) is sent via wicker basket down the river(in a pointlessly ""tense"" scene... come on, everyone in the freaking world knows this story, obviously he won't be eaten by those animals), so he won't catch a bad case of death that's going around. He grows up in the care of the Pharao Picard, and developing a sibling rivalry with the heir to the throne(called ""the weak link"" by his father, thus cementing his stubborn insistence on keeping the slaves), Rameses(Fiennes), who he's always getting into trouble with his actions, and out of it with his words. Their relationship is one solid aspect of this, and one of the only points in making this at all(they realize that a version of this was made in 1956, right? That one's gonna be difficult to top, and, other than aforementioned, this doesn't come close... maybe something eventually will, though I doubt it. Did they think that people wouldn't watch something that old? In spite of the book being 2000 years old...?). The animation is good, with a little well-done 3D. Acting is great all-round, and this is quite well-cast. The dialog is done in a style similar to the original text(...yippee...), and delivered with gusto. Some background and setup is delivered through musical numbers(two of which are horrendous, the rest of them are decent), because that's *definitely* much less obvious of a tool than exposition dumps(in case you couldn't tell, I was being sarcastic). This is paced fine enough, at about 90 minutes and with the amount it covers. I would have preferred if they didn't make the Egyptian deities out to seem like nothing other than ""magic tricks"". As if their faith, or any other, is any better. There is disturbing content in this. I recommend it to fans of 2D. 7/10",The Prince of Egypt
13,neil-476,Solid,8,22 March 2010,"This animated retelling of Moses' story is a piece of good, solid storytelling. But it isn't a great film, or even a memorable film in the way that De Mille's live action predecessor was. I suspect that this is at least partially due to animation being perceived as a more lightweight story-telling medium than live action, and the fact that there are a number of songs scattered through the film may also have a bearing.The storytelling is actually very good, and the animation varies from extremely good upwards (with the parting of the Red Sea being breathtaking).I'm looking backwards, remembering watching this several years ago, and the voice characterisation can be assessed by virtue of the fact that I don't actually recall any of the voices. Looking at the cast list I see that there are some big names there, and I suggest that this means they all did their jobs very well - when the identity of the actor overpowers the character, then I suspect that the casting isn't working that well.",The Prince of Egypt
14,anaconda-40658,An Epic Biblical Animated Masterpiece.,10,20 March 2016,"The Prince of Egypt (1998): Dir: Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, Simon Wells / Voices: Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Sandra Bullock: One of the greatest animations ever made. From the point of view of Moses Egypt is the rise of the poor through the power of God while Rameses reveals how power can be overthrown. It is the story of Moses who is found in a basket in a river and raised in a kingdom. When he learns of his birthright and the slaughter of his people he flees. He finds shelter in a village and eventually encounters God through a burning bush. With God's power he approaches Rameses regarding the release of his people. Rameses refuses and the destruction of his city follows including the exciting climax where the Red Sea parts. Enchanting animated masterpiece directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells and between the three of them they bring out the best in animations. Val Kilmer leads the voice talents as Moses while Ralph Fiennes voices the corrupt Rameses. Michelle Pfeiffer voices Moses's wife who escapes slavery. Jeff Goldblum voices a fellow slave who sheds insight into the treatment of these people. Sandra Bullock voices Moses's sister.

15,HotToastyRag,"Boring, and for some reason, all white?",2,13 September 2019,"Did you love The Ten Commandments but wished it had songs? Then The Prince of Egypt is probably your favorite cartoon. I did like the animation, as it blended classic Egyptian drawings with the modern style, and I'll sit through anything to hear Brian Stokes Mitchell sing, but overall, the cartoon left me wanting. It had enormous potential, just like the 1956 real-people version, but I had the same complaints. Somehow, with a guaranteed box office story draw, the movie managed to be a tad boring. In 1956, with an all-white cast, you could almost forgive Hollywood because of the time period, but in 1998, there was no excuse for using exclusively white actor. Yes, they threw Danny Glover in for a few minutes and dubbed everyone in with more authentic sounding singers, but it seemed ridiculous. Val Kilmer playing Moses? Ralph Fiennes as Rameses, a villain foretold by his English accent? Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Helen Mirren, Patrick Stewart, Steve Martin, Jeff Goldblum, and Martin Short?If you don't have a problem with the casting, you might like this cartoon. The animation is fun, even though the songs are bland and unmemorable. Maybe I'm being too hard on this particular cartoon, since other cartoons have fallen into the same trap of teaching children that American accents are the ""good guys"" and people with funny voices are either villains or comic reliefs. Look at one of my favorites, Anastasia; Meg Ryan and John Cusack don't even try to sound Russian!",The Prince of Egypt
16,StevePulaski,Another beautiful achievement from an animation studio that wants to do so much more,8,11 April 2013,"The Prince of Egypt marks Dreamworks' second film from their animation company and the second in a row to be a big winner for its ambition, scope, and maturity. Coming off of Antz, one of the few animated films out there, I believe, would benefit adults more than children with its very pro-individualist morals. Dreamworks did a fine job of trading in silly puns for strong morals, delivered in a familiar, yet favorable way.Now comes The Prince of Egypt, a successful follow-up predicating on a similar formula with great power and craft. It tells the timeless story of Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), beginning with his birth, when he was sent across a river during impending slave genocide to be the leading voice of the Jews. Right off the bat, this is a story that has been told time and time again, over the span of decades by the voices of competent directors and renowned auteur. Thankfully, Dreamworks spares us the drab redundancy of giving us a visually ordinary, preachy tale with minimal compelling elements. Much like with Antz, the company and crew know who's buying the ticket and who its target audience is, so the balance of entertainment and seriousness is greatly taken into effect.The one definite point of discrepancy from the film that will leave you delighted or divided is the inclusion of songs. Personally, music in animated films has become something of a standard and usually fails to distract from surrounding characters and the story at hand. However, the choice to allow musicality in a story about Moses is definitely made to take in account the young ones who will see it. Appealing to a demographic with an element of familiarity is an understandable feature, but out of place it is, seeing as this is Dreamworks' attempt to seemingly attract audience members with its increasing maturity and depth.Moreover, the artistic style presented here is simply gorgeous; crisper, more fluent, and more atmospheric than much of its competition at the time. The side of Egypt seen here is unlike any animation I've seen from the nineties. In 1998, when this film was released, audiences had already been acquainted with two beautiful Pixar films that brought forth a more attractive, glossier side to animation. This style would begin to take Dreamworks by the hand in 2004 after Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas returned modest numbers, with head Jeffrey Katzenberg stating how the attraction of traditional animation with a traditional story is rapidly dying. The Prince of Egypt possesses a style with a dark color palette and straighter outlines, with characters and scenery aspects that movie in a light that grounds them to reality. It's shockingly potent and beautiful in its representation.The Prince of Egypt has a style and an unconventionality I'd relate to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, one of Disney's biggest gambles that failed to do much but earn a cult following. Both occupy a straighter, more-sophisticated persona for animation, while creating wonderful environments and well-drawn characters with quirks and personalities we can connect with and appreciate. These are fine examples of subversive animated pictures from studios that continue to surprise with almost every film they released.Voiced by: Val Kilmer and Ralph Finnes.

17,MovieAddict2016,It is About Time an Animated Film This Great Came Around...,10,6 December 2002,"""The Prince of Egypt"" features an all-star cast, including Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin and Martin Short. One of the most interesting aspects of this film is how Dreamworks Pictures got such a talented crew to star in an animated film, much less an animated film with morals and a Christian message. Following the Biblical story of Moses, ""The Prince of Egypt"" does take a few creative liberties, but compared to so much other Hollywood garbage based on Bible stories, this film is very true to its roots. Another thing that amazed me about this spectacle was the animation. Over the years, Disney has gone from great animation like ""Snow White"" to films like ""The Emperor's New Groove"" -- good story, but the animation is just too ""cartoony/ish,"" if you know what I mean. However, ""The Prince of Egypt"" does not follow Disney's regress. It marks a revolutionary breakthrough for animation, and will hopefully boot Disney up a notch, as I've heard it has already with Disney's newest animated feature, ""Lilo and Stitch."" If you are in the mood for a true, amazing, family-oriented animated motion picture, see ""The Prince of Egypt,"" which also boasts excellent songs and characters, worthy of overtaking Disney stature.4.5/5 stars --John Ulmer",The Prince of Egypt
18,disdressed12,not that great,5,19 February 2008,"i was not too impressed with this movie.i found it boring and slow paced,for the most part.then just when it picks up momentum,a song starts up and slow everything down.there were just too many songs for my taste and i found some of the songs nonsensical.the animation is as good as many animated features,although there is one CG sequence which is very impressive.the movie depicts the Exodus of the Israelis from Egypt.there are some liberties taken,but there is a disclaimer at the very beginning that states this,so at least they are honest about that.i found the movie emotionally manipulative at times,so that was a bit annoying.anyway,for me,The Prince of Egypt is a 5/10",The Prince of Egypt
19,g-bodyl,A Good Animation Film!,8,14 September 2010,"I really liked this movie with this being one of the first Dreamworks animated features. This film has everything for the family. It has drama, excellent music, and even some action. This movie also has a very good voice cast.This film is based off the book of Exodus of the Bible. Despite a few subtle changes, this movie stays true to the book. It tells the life of Moses and why he was important.As I mentioned before, this film has an awesome voice cast such as Val Kilmer, Steve Martin, and Ralph Fiennes.One thing this movie was not is religious propaganda. This film has religious material, but it's not propaganda. It just tells the story of a book in the Bible.Overall, this is not the best animated movie but still a good one. I would say this is a good family film. I rate this movie 8/10.",The Prince of Egypt
20,Irishchatter,A good film of Moses!,8,25 October 2015,"I think this film was very good, even though I thought Joseph:King of Dreams was more happier and a better underrated film! Anyways it was interesting to find out that Moses was a Prince of Egypt and he was gone from it by accidentally killing a man who abused an old Hebrew slave. I think in my opinion,he should've stayed as a Prince because he wouldn't get the opportunities as a Hebrew man would. Although that means, he wouldn't be able to marry his wife and rekindle with his sister. I wonder what had happened to the brother or was that man the brother or her husband?

It's a sensitive topic, but this in my opinion, this movie is probably the best retelling of the Bible, Book of Exodus on film, to date. I found this movie to be accurate and faithful to the original story. Yes, they change, a few things, but all the changes work for the better. A good example is making the characters younger. I think it's a brilliant example of how you can take artistic license with the scripture and still remain true to the spirit of the source material. Yes, it still have some inaccurates, but at least, it's not mindless theology propaganda drool. I think this movie is even better than director Cecil B. Demille's 1923 & 1956's versions of the Ten Commandments. Don't get me wrong, both 1923 & 1956 versions are classic films, but Prince of Egypt commands attention. It try to do something new, with the source material with its animation musical style. It made people think about their beliefs, by showing the negative effects of the child murders, slavery, and gruesome acts, commit by God and other human beings, more. This was a bit risky. After all, this movie got banned in two countries, on the grounds that the film depicts Islamic prophets. In Prince of Egypt, we get a more human portray of God through Moses. We see, both the warm, and caring side, but also the deep anger and wrath. For a PG movie, it has a lot of cruel violence and some gore, that some parents should know about. Produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures, as their first animation full length movie, and directed by Brenda Chapman, Simon Wells and Steve Hickner; the movie tells the story of Moses (Voiced by Val Kilmer), a Hebrew prince of Egypt, that found the courage and faith to go face to face with his half-brother & pharaoh, Ramses (Voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and lead his people out of slavery. Prince of Egypt works, because it was one of the first films that focused hard on the relationship of the two leaders. You feel the pain, both of them are going through, and how much they wish they could return to what they had. This makes the drama much more interesting. Both voice actors do a great job, showing this. Val Kilmer plays Moses as an every-man, the person who fell into his leadership rather than seeking it out. Kilmer really has this sympathetic like tone. He speaks, very soften, and clear, as if a real-life monk. Ralph Fiennes voiced Moses's half-brother, Ramses was amazing. He portray Ramses as a product of his environment, a tortured soul who still loves his brother, but is under the psychological grip of his overbearing father and his duties as Pharaoh. He really has that, powerful commanding voice that you can't help, feeling intimidated when hearing. Both actors really work well, against each other. I just wish, the supporting cast was as strong as the main leads. Despite, a lot of big name actors, playing supporting characters; the film feels lackluster, in that department. Good actors like Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer and others, feel lost in the scuffle. They don't have many scenes to shine. Other actors like Martin Short & Steve Martin feels not-needed and bit annoying with their premise. The comedy seem forced, and nearly unfunny. It never really feels natural. I always though, the movie could had work better, if they cut, those scenes out. No matter what, the movie still moves in a good pace. For a 99 minutes film, you really do see the characters, change from beginning to end. The animation is very well-done. You got some of the best animators, working on this film. When former animation chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney to start DreamWorks, he took a good amount of people from the Walt Disney Feature Animation Department. When director/producer Steven Spielberg, came onboard, he also brought good animators, from his defunct division of Amblin Entertainment, the Amblimation, known for films like 1991's An American Tail: Fievel Go West & 1995's Balto. Both divisions, work very well, together. You really get the ancient epic scope, by how beautiful, the film looks. I also love, how the movie used computer animation to add, detail. A good example is the burning bush and the water sequences. The songs themselves surprisingly really help to tell the story, too. The opening song by Stephen Schwartz and composer Hans Zimmer, 'Deliver Us' was very powerful. It was so epic! Not only did it help, move the story along, but they also show what the characters are going through. You get to see this, in song sequences like 'Look through heaven's eyes', ""All I Ever Wanted"" & 'The Plagues'. You see, both the joy and suffering that everyone has to deal with. The worst song in the movie has to be 'Playing with the Big Boys'. I really can't stand that song, one bit. It wasn't really needed. My favorite song has to be the power ballad, 'When You Believe'. This is one beautiful song. It goes from a soft spoken beginning to outright happiness. The middle part with the children singing is just uplifting. That song won Best Original Song at the 1999 Academy Awards. Overall: This movie was a decent remake for the most part. Unlike other modern day religionist films. This movie didn't feel like a joke. It's not too preachy or clumsy. It's a pretty good watch.",The Prince of Egypt
23,The-Sarkologist,An Animated Version of the Book of Exodus (at least the first part),7,25 October 2013,"As I watched the previews to this movie it became clear to me that is was about Moses and the Exodus, and because of this I became more interested in seeing it. I guess my motivation was to find out how close this movie stuck to the biblical account. Indeed it does seem to stick reasonably closely, though a few things were added to make it a little more interesting, but the added things were derived from the Bible rather than created. The major addition is that Moses was Pharoah Ramses' brother, which is quite possible considering that Moses was picked up by the queen of Egypt.The movie is based on the Book of Exodus, the second book of the bible. The story is that the Jews have been living in Egypt and have been growing in number, according to the promise God made to Abraham. Fearing that the Jews would revolt, Pharoah ordered all baby boys executed, but Moses was put in a basket and sent down the Nile where he was picked up by the queen. Moses was brought up as a prince but realised that he was a Jew. One day, he killed an overseer that was beating a Jewish slave and fled into the desert where he found a burning bush. In this bush, God spoke to him and commanded him to return to Egypt and free his people. This Moses did, though he was quite hesitant. Pharoah refuses and God strikes Egypt with plagues. Finally, after the death of the first born, Pharoah tells the Jews to go and they flee, but after that Pharoah changes his mind and orders them stopped. By this time the Jews had reached the Red Sea which God parts for them. They cross and flee while the Egyptians following behind are drowned.It is a pretty complicated story but so are many of the stories in the Bible. The complication serves a purpose because this story is a reflection of what Jesus did on the cross. In a way it is an analogy that God created in history. We are slaves to our sins and no matter what we do we cannot escape. God sends a deliverer, who is Jesus, to free us from slavery. God freed the Jews in Egypt from slavery by sending Moses in to lead them out to the promised land. Jesus is sent to Earth to become a human so that he might die on the cross, thus paying the penalty for the sins we have committed. The Jews followed Moses out of slavery in Egypt just as we turn to Jesus to escape the endless cycle of sin and death that dominates our lives. Those who ignore God sin and the penalty of sin is death. A very interesting thing that we see in the movie is that some Egyptians escaped with the Jews, showing us that salvation is for everybody.In this movie we see both sides of God. Many claim that God is a vengeful God in the Old Testament, and that he is. The burning bush scene though shows us both sides of God. When Moses doubts his ability, God roars, throwing him to the ground, but then we see the fatherly side of God as he lifts Moses up onto his feet. We see the wrath of God as the mist flows through Egypt taking the life of all the first born, but we also see the mercy of God as he passes by the doors of all those who have blood on the posts. God is also shown as the protector as he raises a wall of fire before the Egyptians, allowing the Jews to flee.I guess we cannot fully understand why God did not let the Jews escape immediately, but rather sent all of the plagues; yet I guess it follows the idea that God is not only showing his mercy to the Jews but his wrath to the Egyptians. What the Jews were witnessing during the time of the plagues is that God was not only pouring his wrath out onto the people of Egypt, but he was protecting those whom he had chosen. When we look forward to the book of Revelation, we see a repeat of plagues, though they are not exactly the same. What the plagues show us is that God will pour out his wrath upon humanity, but these plagues represent the period that we have a chance to repent of our sins. We can either take the warnings of God and turn to follow him, or we can continue to ignore God's grace and face judgment and death at the end of time.",The Prince of Egypt

26,Rectangular_businessman,A monumental effort,9,6 April 2012,"This was one of the films from DreamWorks Animation, which replaced the previous animation studio created by Steven Spielberg, along with ""Antz"". However, in my opinion, ""The Prince of Egypt"" was way much better than Antz, having an incredible visual style and a memorable story, which has all the feeling of the classic religious epic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, with lots of memorable scenes and great songs. The combination of CGI and traditional animation is simply magnificent, being quite impressive even by the standards of modern animation, with lots of technological advancement. Also, the character's designs were stylish and original: Most of the animated films that were released in the nineties tried to imitate the Disney's aesthetic in order to emulate the success that this company was having in the same decade with modern classics as ""The Lion King"", but unlike any of those productions, this film tried to do something completely different. Even the musical numbers were quite different of the ones that appeared in Disney's movies. In many ways, this was the most risky production from DreamWorks.But all that beauty would have been meaningless if that same level of effort wasn't put in the story and the characters as well. And that's why this movie it's more effective than most of the other animated films released by DreamWorks: The characters have lots of deep and development, feeling as real human characters instead of flat caricatures. Their conflicts and emotions are believable, and the epic setting of the story serves to make all those elements into something unforgettable.Too bad that DreamWorks doesn't make this kind of movies anymore. I don't have anything against animated CGI comedies (Actually, I loved some of them, like ""Kung Fu Panda"") but it would be nice to see that studio producing something risky and epic as this movie.",The Prince of Egypt

Once Moses gets older he later finds out that his a jewish slave and runs away to try and make sense of his life and to save his people. Will Moses save his people and ask for God help.Overall this film still lies ahead of it's time. The animation is gorgeous, the music is excellent I would go so far to say that it's up there with Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame as it's so criminally underrated and deserves to be a classic. It's definetly one of my favourite non Disney films of all time.If you haven't seen it do watch it or try and track it down on DVD.A-",The Prince of Egypt
29,CubsandCulture,It has a couple of good songs and beautiful animation but...,7,15 March 2021,"I re-watched this after about 20 years of seeing it in the theatre. It does not hold up as well as I would have liked. There's too much ground covered in the narrative given the film's shorter runtime. The story is rushed because of this. Several sequences are mere montages. Worst the film doesn't have a strong sense of where in the Exodus story it is going to end and the final couple of story bears land flat. The Heston version of this story from the 50's is the better story.With that said, the animation is very beautiful and the directors even took a couple of stylistic risks with some sequences, i.e. Moses' dream about his origin. The film is wonderful to look at. Likewise, the score is very good. The Plagues and Playing With the Big Boys are a couple of striking songs and sequences. Dreamworks animation struggled for several years upon being founded and this is the weakest of their efforts in that time frame.",The Prince of Egypt
30,rbverhoef,A great story told in beautiful animation,8,24 January 2004,"Whether you believe the bible, the story of Moses, or not, it is a great story to tell. The movie tells his story from the day the pharaoh of Egypt orders to kill all Hebrew baby boys, the day Moses' sister Miriam (voice of Sandra Bullock) puts him in a basket and leaves the basket in the river. That day Moses is found by the Egyptian princess and the pharaoh raises him as his own son. Moses' brother is Rameses, who will be the pharaoh of Egypt one day.As an adult Moses (voice of Val Kilmer) finds out he belongs to the Hebrew people and after God (again voice of Kilmer) has spoken to him he goes to Rameses (voice of Ralph Fiennes), who is Pharaoh by then, to ask for the release of his people. Rameses rejects this and the ten plagues are a fact.The great story is told with the most beautiful animation. Especially the splitting of the Red Sea is very impressive. All this, the great songs and the voice talents of Kilmer, Fiennes, Bullock but also Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren and Steve Martin and Martin Short for the comedy moments make this a very impressive animated movie.",The Prince of Egypt
31,Spleen,Wonderful - shame about the religion,8,15 July 1999,"This is great fun - breathtaking in many places.  It does have some of the problems of a first effort.  (Remember Disney's old glory days: ""Snow White"" also had its problems, and in retrospect was awkward and under-done when compared to ""Bambi"" and ""Pinocchio"".)  I'll start with the problems.There's a certain want of polish.  Dreamworks does not yet have Disney's impressive stable of character animators - Moses and the Queen are excellent, others are lacking - and extra work and money can't make up the deficit.  Computer graphics have been misused yet again.  (This time they've been mis-applied to water.  The scene where Moses's cradle sloshes about on a digital Nile is just a mismatch; and the parting of the Red Sea, despite all the artificial awe that gets whipped up, looks cheesy when placed next to its counterpart in ""Fantasia"", made 58 years earlier.)This is no problem, really.  All I'm really saying is that Dreamworks is behind in the arms race at the moment.  Most of the artwork is superb. Many of the effects - during the plagues, especially, although because of undue compression we only get to really see three of the plagues - are truly something to be proud of.  Visually we can't complain.Here are the moments that really stuck in my throat:Firstly, the concluding song.  (It was hideous: but that's not the point.) Over and over the tuneless warble goes: ""There will be miracles - if you believe.""  A more witless summing up of the story would be hard to imagine. It's New Age, not Old Testament.  If the story has told us anything, it's that there will be miracles whether or not we believe.  The God of the Old Testament is a kind of iron juggernaut.  He showers Egypt with plagues in order to free his people, whatever their psychological states may be. (Sometimes, if they cease to believe, he sends a miracle in order to bring them round.)  The songwriters have evidently confused ""The Prince of Egypt"" with ""Dumbo"".Secondly, and related ...  I draw your attention to the scene where Moses turns his staff into a snake, the Egyptian priests turn their staves into snakes, and Moses's snake eats the other two snakes.  How many gods have been responsible for miracles here?  At least two.  Yet the Egyptian priests are portrayed as charlatans, who get by entirely with stage magic.  -There are, in fact, two ways of telling the story.  According to one the priests ARE charlatans and there is just one source of genuine miracles; according to the other (more textually accurate, and better) interpretation, the Egyptian priests command real magic, and the Egyptian gods are real gods - just not as powerful as Yahweh.  Either story told unambiguously would have made for a better movie.  But it also would have annoyed too many American Christians (and possibly Jews).  That, indeed, is the general problem. Every so often the film-makers tread into territory that might offend a modern religious group, and they freeze rigid.  If only they were as cavalier about offending modern religions as they were about offending Egyptian pagans.That's how things could have been better, but they're good enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen for every minute.  When the gods keep their noses out of mortal affairs, ""Prince of Egypt"" soars.",The Prince of Egypt

They are best friends and they have a great life in their palace,with strong bonds.

Moises cannot believe that he is not royal and stays angry with Miriam, but stays in doubt after some while, and reading the walls of the pyramid, he discovers the true: that he has Jew blood and was adopted. Angry and thinking that everything he always imagined to be true were illusions, he run away and starts a new life as shepherd and even marrying Tzipporah.

35,mike48128,A Miracle of Music and Animation,9,6 April 2013,"This is not a ""children's cartoon"". The animated ""Prince of Egypt"" borrows some of the settings from Cecil B. DeMille's classic but manages to tell the story in a streamlined way in a mere 100 minutes. The musical score is a ""miracle"" with several excellent songs, including the Oscar-winner ""When You Believe"". It's a different yet respectful retelling of the Ten Commandments with half the characters and some very original ideas. In this version, Ramses and Moses truly love each other and it is a terrible twist-of-fate that Moses must destroy him to free his people. Ramses wife is not shown, but obviously exists, as the pharaoh has a son who must die because he is the first-born. It's all here: the burning bush, the serpent's trick, water turning to blood, the other plagues and the Red Sea finale. No golden calf idol, however. In this version, Moses' wife stands beside him, as does Miriam and Arron. All resemble the actors from the DeMille version. What is minimized are the backgrounds of the large edifices and monuments. It all works, however, even the contrived ""chariot race"" that seems borrowed from ""Ben-Hur"". Minor faults prevent me from giving this a ""10"" : Ralph Fiennes' British accent is annoying, and ""slips"" in a few of the key dramatic scenes. God's ""voice"" seems too young and not majestic enough. The fire-carving of the tablets is not depicted, although Moses comes down from the mountain with them.

You may be saying ""big deal, it's a kid's movie, stop shovin' God in our faces all the time"".  Well, I'd agree with you if this wasn't based on THE OLD TESTAMENT!!!!!A lot of the big scenes are treated like after-thoughts (Moses' exile into the desert, the Burning Bush scene, etc.), there's little to no character development (especially in Rameses and Moses, which is a shock) and scant mention of God and His hand in things.

40,gbheron,Wrong Subject Matter,5,4 January 2001,"""The Prince of Egypt"" is certainly top-of-the-line animation. Drawing, display, characterizations, music, voices; they're all very good and up to Disney quality. What kills ""Prince of Egypt"" is the story DreamWorks chooses to tell; that of the Book of Exodus of the Old Testament.  For many this is Holy Scripture, and not an apt subject for light-hearted animation. What is off-putting to me is the grimness of much of the Moses story. This is not a malleable piece of fiction like Tarzan, Aladdin, or Hercules. These are easily molded to provide the goofy sidekick, singing friends or ghastly villains. Exodus cannot be so changed, and much of the story is very savage; the mass murder of infants, plagues, legions of slaves, and whole armies swallowed up by the sea. There's no getting around this. But still DreamWorks tries for the perky animation with accompanying music, and then tries to tell the story straight up, infanticide and all. Didn't work for me, sorry. I suggest sticking with Disney.",The Prince of Egypt

From Moses placed among the reeds to the parting of the Red Sea, we have that Old Testament chestnut Exodus with fresh songs for the kiddies.The Good: You know what, a big budget animated version of this story really isn't a bad idea. While this will not compete with Pixar's best this is some pretty solid animation and voice work. The story also should take credit for not soft-peddling the rougher edges of an Old Testament God which would have been easy to do in a film clearly marketed to kids.The Bad: The first thirty minutes or so suffers from two main problems. Our hero is a horrible person who engages in awful cruelty and slapstick and the songs are pretty bad. The good news is both Moses and the songs get much better in the middle of the film.Trying to explain to the kiddies what happens next after that upbeat ending... Well, Ramses ended up okay and actually became one of the greatest Pharaohs of Egypt... Learned his lesson and all that... Oh, Moses and his people? Well, they ran into a snag... paperwork issues... some incident with a golden calf... it's complicated.The Ugly: Those poor parents who didn't realize this was an Old Testament film. Old Testament God does not play and eldritch horrors are coming to get you. The film's marketing definitely downplays the Bible aspect of this and that is a shame. There are some very good messages about the worth of a man for example. There is also the lesson that both God and Pharaoh share something in common... they both like slaughtering all the children.Oh, and the Angel of Death shows up among the rivers of blood, plagues, and fire from the sky.

45,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,The most heartwarming animated biblical masterpiece since the landmark of Disney,10,27 December 2011,"After the Amblimation got shut down in 1997 due to the lukewarm reception of Balto, a new animation company was made and was joined by the great Steven Spielberg along with Jeffrey Katzenberg (who quited his job for the Disney company after the release of The Lion King) known as Dreamworks Animation. After making their very first CGI animated film, ""Antz"", they released their very first traditional animated feature, ""The Prince of Egypt"" before making recent franchises such as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon.Almost based on the Ten Commandments, it takes place in Egypt, eons of years ago where Pharaoh Seti commands all male Hebrew babies to be drowned. A desperate mother places her son in a basket and lets the Hebrew god guide it along its way on the river. The basket is found by the Queen, and Moses is brought up as a brother to the heir of the throne, Ramses. Years later, the brothers, who grew up happily and wealthy, are split by Moses' recognition of his true heritage and the suppressing system his brother is about to inherit, willing to carry it on. Fleeing from the city in despair, Moses finds himself being called by God. He is given the task of being the messenger in order to free the Hebrews and to lead them into a country where milk and honey flow.While Disney films only focused on fairy tales, myths and legends, this is the first non-Disney animated feature to take place in Egypt while telling a religious story about Moses, but not only that. It's Dreamworks Animation's astounding achievement since this is their first debut in the animation genre.The story is heartwarming that mixes drama, love, and faith so perfectly. It's almost based on the Ten Commandments, but compared to the 1956 epic, it doesn't have to be. While Disney's films have darker tones, this movie has the same along with mature tones as well. The animation, like all of Disney's films, is an example of pure beauty with astounding visuals including the look of Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the river of blood, a whale in the Red Sea, and the Burning Bush (even the character animation is pretty good).The voice acting is excellent. It has a killer cast including Val Kilmer, Michelle Pfieffer, Ralph Fiennes, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Steve Martin, and Martin Short. Their performances are great and portrayed the characters beautifully. The music from Hans Zimmer is beautiful and the songs written by Stephen Schwartz are compelling (which means very convincing) in a Disney-esque style. ""When You Believe"", ""Deliver Us"", ""Look Through Heaven's Eyes"", ""Playing With The Big Boys Now"", and the rest were great. Even the songs in both the ending credits and music videos were pretty damn good.The Prince of Egypt became the start of Dreamworks Animation's attempt to make three more traditional animated films (1998-2003) before making successful computer animated flicks (1998-present) and will always be recommended to the animation industry as a masterpiece since the landmark of Disney. A perfect thumbs up from me.Rating: 10/10",The Prince of Egypt
46,Mightyzebra,A film that posses its flaws.,3,2 October 2007,"Unfortunately, ""The Prince Of Egypt"" is overshadowed with a very dark and violent feeling, which will with no doubt depress many viewers of the film. You may also like this film, despite the killing of innocent Egyptians and Hebrews and the horrible excitement of the film. You less likely to like this film if you are one of the following people:1. An Egyptian person. 2. Someone who does not believe in the Bible. 3. A person who does not believe in God. 4. A person who prefers calmer films.If you are one of the following people you are much more likely to enjoy this film:1. Someone who IS NOT an Egyptian. 2. Someone who does not particularly care for the Egyptian race. 3. Someone who believes in the Bible or God. 4. A person who wants to watch a more violent, darker cartoon film.This film is animated, based on much of the story of Moses. The animation is beautiful, but that is pretty much the only light thing about this film.",The Prince of Egypt
47,bigverybadtom,"""The Ten Commandments"" Animated-But Not For The Kiddiewinks",10,13 June 2015,"As was mentioned in Wikipedia, this movie is an animated remake of ""The Ten Commandments"". The movie has songs and special effects, but it is not in any way cutesy-it tells the story of Moses in full harshness. We see the brutality of Egyptian society and of the gods, and the attitudes of the people of the era.It is the story, as told in the Biblical Exodus, of how a baby was put in a basket in the river to escape harm, and was found by the royal rulers of Egypt. Moses would adopt the attitudes of his adopted family-until he is forced to learn of his relationship to the enslaved tribes of the Hebrews.The movie is more morally ambiguous than most. There are no true heroes and villains, and Ramses, though technically the bad guy, is simply the natural product of his society, with the attitudes he was raised up on. Meant for the older children, rather than the tots who will find the subject matter harsh and frightening.",The Prince of Egypt
48,elicopperman,There Can be Miracles When you Believe,10,21 April 2018,"20 years ago to this day, Dreamworks Animation released their second feature film, The Prince of Egypt, based off the book of exodus. Although it received critical acclaim and did pretty well financially, it isn't really looked upon as much as other Dreamworks films like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda or How to Train Your Dragon. That being said, I personally think that this is one of their most outstanding achievements in both film and animation, and a highly respectable adaptation from the Bible. What's interesting about this adaptation is that at its core, it's a story about brothers: Moses and Ramses. The two different sides they choose end up tarnishing their relationship, making it very hard to feel sorry for either side. Moses transitions from a pompous son of Pharaoh to a man determined on freeing the enslaved Hebrews tremendously and the film really displays just how conflicted he becomes over his duty and trying to fulfill his task without harming anyone. Even though Ramses is despicable for his crimes as Pharaoh, it's made clear that his prejudice was passed down from generation to generation. As such, the film becomes all the more heartbreaking once the inevitable plagues come afloat, ruining both Egypt and siblings forever.Speaking of the plagues, it's remarkable how the film never shies away or sugarcoats the biblical story, showing off many mature themes and horrific imagery throughout the feature. In addition, the feature appropriately takes itself rather seriously, avoiding a lot of juvenile antics and cliches found in animated family films. While it may frighten some, it's always important to remember the horrible tragedies that had to take place in order to free the Israelis. For the first ever hand-drawn animated film made at the studio, the crew really went all out in creating a grand epic scale that truly showcases the impressive monuments in Egypt, from their rise to their demise. Along with realistic albeit stylized character designs and solid character animation, the visuals practically scream ancient Egypt, down to a scene depicting the killing of the first born Hebrew children being done in wall art. The parting of the Red Sea is a legendary moment in animation, really pushing the envelope of what computer animation and effects could pull off back in the day.As this film is a musical, it more than ever delivers with stunning and gut wrenching songs done by the wonderful Stephen Schwartz. ""Deliver Us"" sets the tone of the movie by showcasing the proper hardships that the Hebrews faced, ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" enlightens Moses in his reformed culture with the right amount of cheers and wonderment, and ""The Plagues"" song really showcases just how horrific the plagues really were while also rightfully showing the pain and devastation shown through Moses and Ramses. Finally, the Oscar winning ""When You Believe"" presents true exhilaration as the Hebrews taste the freedom that they desired for years. Not to mention, Hans Zimmer brings his usual poetically epic and spiritual score to elevate the emotional and grandiose aspects the film exhibits.Given how rare it is to see animated retellings from the Bible, this film truly is remarkable in how respectful, passionate and mature it is in doing so. With an epic scope, a heartbreaking story of sibling rivalry, and a fantastic score, The Prince of Egypt still shines as one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of the 1990s, if not of all time. Without a doubt, even if you're not religious, check this film out to gain a great taste of this well developed adaptation of biblical text to see what Dreamworks could have become if they stuck to this. It's kind of a shame Dreamworks hasn't done anything like this since its release, but considering that it's playing at Annecy soon to commemorate its 20th anniversary, here's to a bright legacy for the film in the following years.",The Prince of Egypt
49,dilipbts,The prince of Egypt,8,21 June 2020,"For sheer spectacle, it's tough to beat the Bible. With ""The Prince of Egypt,"" DreamWorks makes good on its promise to deliver a state-of-the-art animated film that will compete favorably with the best Disney has to offer. As with ""Antz,"" released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales. (I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an ""inspirational"" album, and a ""country"" album--were really necessary.) The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching ""The Prince of Egypt"" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry. The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons. The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder. One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette. (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts. By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.",The Prince of Egypt
50,action-6,Great film with top animation and nice music,8,2 June 2000,"The Prince Of Egypt is a film about Moses, who grew up as an Egyptian prince, not knowing that he was a Hebrew. Moses is ordered by God to free his people from slavery in Egypt, which becomes quite problematic since Moses grew up as brother of the son of the Egyptian king, who later became king. The Prince Of Egypt is a movie with cutting-edge-animation and graphics and with a great soundtrack and nice songs.  The story is simple and very easy to follow, so it`s great for younger viewers.  Definetely worth seeing at least once. 8,5/10",The Prince of Egypt

But what's lacking here is that sense of ""heart"" that shines through in almost all Disney works.  This may be a 'babysitter' for the VERY young, but for anyone else this is a KLUNKER. It's gonna die at the box-office...wanna bet?",The Prince of Egypt
52,La Gremlin,Compelling and moving,8,4 December 2001,I won't get too complicated here.  This movie was a true labor of love and it looks the part.  It is absolutely gorgeous and spiritually heartwarming. The music is excellent and I especially loved the stylized artwork.  It is a must-see for animation fans.,The Prince of Egypt
53,flicklover,Rousing telling of the Exodus story!,9,3 April 2004,"Just about every year I watch ""the Ten Commandments"", it is a great epic, but one thing that I have always thought is that it lacked heart, it was more about the spectacle of the story than the actual meaning of it. Then came ""Prince of Egypt"", an beautifully made, incredibly underrated animated masterpiece. Animated films never get the respect they deserve because most of the moviegoing and critics pass them off as pure entertainment for children, true they are targeted for a young audience, but in the case of this film, the story of Moses has enough for any adult to enjoy. The movie focuses on the relationship between Moses and Ramses, and the other part of the story most of us are familiar with is told in a fresh way, the animation is as good as anything that has ever come out of Disney. The movie does have comic relief, but it never resorts to the ""cute and funny"" sidekick formula that is so common in animated films. It is entertaining, and it is meant to be an adventure, but the subject is presented in a serious way, the filmmakers have a great love and respect for the story. The voices are done by very known actors, but Val Kilmer as Moses and Ralph Feinnes as Ramses stand out in their roles. The movie can be called spiritual, but I wouldn't call it a religious movie. It is a great retelling of one of the great stories of the Old Testament, done with great heart and respect.Grade: A",The Prince of Egypt
54,deepfrieddodo,Impressive Retelling,8,22 December 2020,"A very engaging method of telling the story of Exodus. The story obviously has and will continue to last for centuries, and whilst the animation may not have that kind of legacy, it still stands up well today and doesn't really lack any cinematic elements that may be on offer now, two decades later.The story is told well, with a star-studded cast which doesn't remove you from the story. In fact, I only recognised Goldblum whilst watching, the rest in the credits were a surprise. For the most part it keeps true to the biblical story, but that doesn't mean this is only suitable for the religious, it's open and an engrossing story for all.",The Prince of Egypt
55,dy158,Nice cinematography.,9,29 June 2006,"I will always forever associated with the Whitney Houston-Mariah Carey's 'When You Believe' with my secondary school days because this song was picked to be the closing song from the school's choir for our school's anniversary concert four years ago. Whenever I listened to the song, it will always brings me back those days. I know it's part of the soundtrack.Anyhow, I remembered I saw this back then in secondary school during one of those post-exam activities. And it was being showed a few times here on the television as well. I think it's the year before or something the last time it was on here.The whole cinematography was quite nice, the story is kind of moving.Overall, not that bad.",The Prince of Egypt
56,squirrel_burst,"Not just a Sunday School Special, it's a joy to watch",10,8 January 2015,"""The Prince of Egypt"" isn't just for Sunday school, it's a well made animated epic with lush, detailed backgrounds, a story that's tight, an excellent soundtrack and performances that are just as good. We've seen the story of Exodus done multiple times now, but this animated version manages to bring something new to the field. Like any great film, every detail has been carefully considered, from the colour palettes which are adapted depending on the mood of the scene to the details on the Egyptian buildings which make this world feel genuine. What I really love about this adaptation is that it never skimps out on the spectacle of the story, with numerous crowd shots were thousands of characters are moving and enormous statues and buildings to really make it clear how overwhelming powerful the Egyptian empire is. It also manages to do several things that wouldn't have worked in a live action film. My go-to example is the dream sequence that is animated to look like moving Egyptian art. You've never seen anything like it and I think it really brings something special to the story. You would think that this movie is a Disney knockoff when you hear that there are several songs throughout, but this is a story that will appeal both to children and adults. There aren't any silly talking animals or magical talking statues that give advice to Moses or Rameses. The songs are used to develop the characters and further the story, in a way that is similar to a montage, but significantly more entertaining in my book because it gives you something to listen to besides catch phrases uttered between brief action shots. The voice acting is also very good and there are some subtle but interesting choices that will speak differently to you depending on your views of this biblical story (such as the casting of Val Kilmer as both Moses and God). There is humour present, but the focus is on the drama, the feelings of being torn between two different lives or two opposite and important choices. I feel like because of the spectacle of it, the well made animation, the acting, the soundtrack and the tried-and-true story of a Prince who must choose between his adopted family and his biological one, one to come to blows with his brother, that you can enjoy ""The Prince of Egypt"" even if the passage isn't a part of your faith.

57,Darkjak007,respectfully&tasteful retelling of the book of Exodus,8,4 April 2021,"The prince of Egypt tells the story of Moshe Rabbnu known throughout as Moses the holy prophet, who led The Hebrew slaves of Egypt to freedom from under the reign of the pharaoh. The book of Exodus is one of the most famous pieces of religious literature, given the subject matter it's some what difficult to adapt this story to appeal to everyone but not come off as sacrilegious. The prince of Egypt delivers with its powerful message, beautiful visuals and remarkable soundtrack(with the exception of playing with the big boys). The film's often regarded as the animated version of Cecil B. DeMille The Ten Commandments. However that's not a fair claim while prince of Egypt does follow the story of Moses it does take liberties in certain areas in the beginning. Moses (Val Kilmer)is portray more as the everyday man. Similar to a college student he reckless and mischievous along with his brother Ramses(Ralph Fiennes).he doesn't just come off as the perfect man. It gives you more to relate to him instead of him being more as Charlton Heston's who is just right off the back more of a saint and it gives you an idea of how Moses grows as the time passes through the story. Ramses you get scenes of him and Moses bonding as Brothers. You see the scolding from his father Seti about him being the weak link in the dynasty, and not wanting to prove this true. It gives more depth to the struggle between him and Moses as opposed to him just being a tyrant who you know nothing about. The visuals are stunning the wide scope shots of the Nile from the palace throne room, the movement of the fire on the bush. The film offers a perfect mix of colors from bright warm colors to dark cool colors. Despite the films more comedic moments it still takes the subject matter seriously. The suffering of the slaves and the outcome of the plagues are filled with moments of grief and sadness. One thing the movie could've done is add a few more scenes in between certain segments. Understandably the studio has to push the story forward because the ten Commandments which was three hours and 40 minutes this movie is only an hour and 40 minutes. This movie could've been two hours on the dot to have those scenes Feel less condense.",The Prince of Egypt
58,cinephile-27690,The Best Animated Movie I Have Ever Seen-A Masterpiece Of The Genre Everyone SHOULD See!,10,26 July 2019,"I liked this movie as a kid, though- despite owning it- I rarely watched it. Now I adore it! As I have gotten older, I have seen it numerous times, and I own it on a double feature DVD with it's prequel-Joseph:King of Dreams, which I have reviewed on IMDB as well.The movie simply tells the Biblical story of Moses, and how he freed his people from slavery. There are liberties taken to make the story its own epic, such as Moses and the Pharaoh being his brother for further conflict. Even the opening suggests looking up the actual story in the Book of Exodus.The movie also has an impressive cast-many of whom are NOT religious. The cast includes Val Kilmer as Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Ramses the brother, Patrick Stewart stars as the original Pharaoh and Helen Mirren is his wife.The Pharaoh has 2 magician assistants, who call on false gods to perform magic. The tall one is Martin Short and the short one is Steve Martin. (There is a missed opportunity there, but whatever.)Miriam and Aaron, Moses's biological siblings, are played by Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum, respectively. Moses's wife Tzipporah is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, and her father Jethro is played by Danny Glover. (Brian Mitchell Stokes sings his song-Through Heaven's Eyes- from which Moses learns that God has a purpose for him, even when he can't see it.)There are other great songs in this movie(it is also a musical)-ones like Deliver Us, Playing With The Big Boys, The Plagues, and When You Believe-which not only has a Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey rendition in the credits but also won the Oscar for Best Song!I don't know anyone personally who has seen it and hates it. My youth pastor loves it, and I showed it to some church friends who also loved it. My cousin loves it too-it's in his top 10 favorite movies, and deservedly so! Also, if you look at You Tube comments about the movie, you can see that even non-religious people find this movie astounding!There are also many critics who like it, such as Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel, James
Berardinelli, Doug Walker(""Nostalgia Critic"") and Ani Mat-who is on You Tube.No other Dreamworks movie can compare to this masterpiece! Shrek, Madagascar, How To Train Your Dragon? They have NOTHING on The Prince of Egypt! Even if I were to rank all Dreamworks's animated movies, spot 1 and 2 would have a huge gap in quality!This is also sadly overlooked. The Dreamworks movies I mentioned above get more attention than The Prince of Egypt does. That's just sad. TPOE needs more love, people!No words could satisfy my high admiration for The Prince of Egypt! 3 out of 3 people found my old review helpful, and here's to hoping this makes more people see this astonishing work of art!

59,patriciogl10,A well-known story with an animated turn.,8,25 October 2018,"One certainly can be discouraged to see this film just because it tells the familiar story of Moises, but in an animated setting. But don't be fooled, this is a wonderful film, that contains well written dialogue, great animation, excellent voice work, decent songs and also a fabulous detailed coloring that I really appreciated.
It basically tells the story we all know, and despite some minor inaccuracies, the story delivers and it reaches its climax in the most fervent way, with the animation really exceeding my own expectations, which I thought it was absolutely phenomenal.One thing I didn't like is that in certain parts it sort of felt rushed, specially the part concerning the plagues. That went by really fast, to which I thought they could have slowed down the pace a little bit to make it flow more smoothly, but I understand that due to time constraints they had to fit the whole story under one hour and forty minutes.A special mention to Ralph Fiennes who in my opinion puts on a great voice performance as Ramses, and so did the rest of the cast including Val Kilmer as Moises and Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah to a lesser extent.
I feel this movie is kind of forgotten in time, and it shouldn't be that way. Sure, it tells a biblical story not many people are fond of, but once you get pass that, it is actually an entertaining film, with shades of epicness drawn all over it.",The Prince of Egypt

Extracted from Exodus, the second book of the Jewish Torah and the Christian Old Testament - the story of how Moses led the enslaved Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness to Mount Sinai (after crossing the Red Sea).The Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of the last 20 years, because it achieves what many of the classic Disney films did; it translates love, passion, story and song so beautifully through the characters and the settings. This is very much a great classic; in strange way it is reminiscent of the old Cecil B.

62,TheCorniestLemur,Mosin' around,7,14 November 2021,"Well, I could do without the musical number with a backdrop of slaves being whipped and abused, but...I am not a religious person, or at least if I do believe in anything supernatural, traditional Christianity is just about the last thing on that list. I mean come on, there's more plot holes in your religion than the entire Harry Potter series, and now that I think about it, a lot of those are because the characters are far too overpowered too.I guess I can kind of forgive the plot holes when the existence of an all-powerful entity on the protagonist's side is always going to raise some questions, namely why does he ever struggle at all, and also perhaps even more obviously, why would you kill hundreds of innocent children when your wispy butt could just waft into the pharaoh's room and kill him directly...but I'll take that up with the organisation trying to indoctrinate me, not the film trying to entertain me.And entertain me it did. I'm not sure about the prevailing opinion that it's a masterpiece and easily Dreamworks' best film, but I enjoyed it. It's most definitely one of their best looking and best directed films, if nothing else. The animation is pretty stunning and there will be a few shots from this hanging around in my mind for a while.The voice acting is decent, although I was shocked at how many big names made up the cast, because I didn't recognise any of them, and the overall story and characters are good and well paced.The only big issue I have is the musical numbers. I don't really like any of them, and often they completely disrupt or ruin the mood of a scene, like with the aforementioned song right at the beginning while an army of slaves is being whipped and forced to build giant statues. Let's just say it isn't really a good match of tones.And at the end of it, I was up one good film, and still quite low on the amount of times I've thought about believing in the Christian god, so I guess I can't complain either way.",The Prince of Egypt
63,TheVictoriousV,"Modern ""Christian cinema"" can learn so much from this masterwork",9,20 June 2021,"It's the honesty of older religious films that makes me prefer them to the output of Pure Flix, on top of the fact that movies like The Prince of Egypt were made out of passion and exemplify untrammeled, big-thinking artistry, whereas the God's Not Dead franchise simply aims to make its creators feel better about their losses in the ""existence of God"" debate. Despite ostensibly being a kid's film, The Prince of Egypt (like the far more brutal Noah and Passion of the Christ) does not shy away from the brutality and death of The Bible; the godly wrath that many Christians will shrug at and go ""Well, those people should've just prayed to the right deity"". To think, then, that the film would also work as an animated musical, and establish DreamWorks as the reigning Disney competitor.Let me be clear: I'm not trying to claim this movie for myself as an anti-religious retelling of the Book of Exodus. Yes, it's inordinately blunt about the plagues and makes God appear nearly as ruthless as the Egyptian slavers, but in spite of its harsh questions about uncritical faith, the film has several inspiring songs on the spiritual/heavenly mindset. ""Heaven's Eyes"" is a superb number that, in short, speaks about the limits of living on Earth - in the present and with oneself, using only one's senses - instead of understanding one's role in the flow of time. Reality as we know it cannot rightly exist without you, the person reading this. (This, in a way, rings true even if you should believe in no creation myths or even the very idea of grand purpose.)But the movie's refusal to go fully black-and-white on us, keeping the villainous Rameses remarkably human and punishing his slavery with possibly equivalent evils, results in complexity - far more so than going ""God works in mysterious ways"", or ""I dunno, it's complicated"", and still insisting on the narrative of the Abrahamic God being all good. As I see it, this is as smart and sagacious as any film can ever be while still being religious. ""When You Believe"", the most famous song from the movie, makes the case for faith even as it knows the truth.But let's rewind a bit, for those of you who aren't as familiar with The Prince of Egypt and mainly know the DreamWorks company for Trolls, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, Boss Baby, How to Train Your Dragon, and the one with the ogres. There's actually quite a history here.DreamWorks was founded in the 90s by one Jeffrey Katzenberg, who had previously worked at The Walt Disney Company and gone through several tiffs with its CEO at the time, Michael Eisner. Two of DreamWorks' earliest films, Antz and Shrek, were direct middle fingers at Eisner (the former was unapologetically competing with Disney-Pixar's A Bug's Life and the latter poked fun at both Disney and Eisner himself, depicting him as a total Farquaad who claims ownership over various fairy tales), but 1998's The Prince of Egypt denotes Katzenberg's true liberation. This was the movie he had always wanted to make but Disney kept shaking their heads no.And to think, when the film finally saw the light of day, it turned out to be just as good, if not better than the Disney Renaissance releases of the time. Mulan, Hercules, and Tarzan were certainly more popular and, in some ways, looked more spectacular, but lacked the ideas and themes that made The Prince of Egypt FEEL large as well as LOOK large.Essentially a remake of Cecil B. DeMille's 1956 epic The Ten Commandments (itself a remake of the silent version from 1923), the movie follows Moses (Val Kilmer) as he grows up in the palace of Pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart) and Queen Tuya (Helen Mirren) and gets into trouble with his adoptive brother and best friend Rameses (Ralph Fiennes). He is unaware of his past amongst the Hebrews, and what the man he calls ""father"" has done to them.One night, following an escaped Midianite woman named Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer), Moses comes across two slaves, Miriam and Aaron (Sandra Bullock and a very entertaining Jeff Goldblum), who claim to be his true siblings. Soon, in one masterful sequence after the other (including a hieroglyphic retelling of Pharaoh's acts and a skillfully edited goodbye between Moses and Rameses), Moses learns the horrid truth and leaves his royal ""family"" behind.He is welcomed to the land of Midian by Jethro (Danny Glover), who sings the aforementioned ""Heaven's Eyes"" tune (now voiced by Brian Stokes Mitchell) after Moses starts doubting his worth. Soon he encounters the Burning Bush from the original story, which speaks in the voice of the one true God - quite the revelation when you're used to believing in several. On paper, God is also voiced by Kilmer, but as an additional nice touch, the voices of every person Moses has ever met can also be heard when He speaks and declares Moses the deliverer of the Jews. The imagery, symbolism, and use of color in this scene remind us why we have animation: telling a tale like this through a method with freer range than live-action photography was a faultless choice (don't get me started on the ""Plagues"" sequence).Also on the cast are Martin Short and Steve Martin as the high priests, a duo of unusually important comic relief characters, who represent the old ways and whose parlor tricks keep Rameses devoted to the Egyptian gods, fueling his stubbornness and leading to his eventual breaking point. Even more important is the voice of Ofra Haza, who voices Moses' real mother and has recorded the opening number, ""Deliver Us"", in 17 languages including the original English.All the characters I've mentioned are memorable to one extent or the other, but Moses and Rameses are the most significant. Their relationship is what makes the film. Even after the movie's climax, where they both surely view each other's ways as vile and inexcusable, we still discern some level of brotherly love between them. Rameses is a fantastic character (this is possibly the most we can humanize a ruthless king without seeming apologetic) and the animation and voice work do the writing justice. No matter how we ultimately feel about Moses or Rameses, the sheer heartbreak of their story is undeniable.And really, that's what's so wonderful about the film. Even if I disagreed with its seeming religiosity (as mentioned, I'm okay with religiosity when it's this free from the psychopathic denial I often observe amongst the ""God did nothing wrong"" crowd), I could never deny how purposeful its presentation is - framing, staging, transitions, stylistic shifts, color choices, expressions, wordlessness, et cetera - in communicating the themes as well as the relationships, emotions, and conflicts of the central characters, nor how splendidly conducted and intelligently written these songs are, be they inspiring, despairing, or bittersweetly hopeful. Even your average nationalist, who won't agree with the notion that there's been a tinge of unjust cruelty toward Jews throughout history (some of them might only disagree with the ""unjust"" part, in keeping with today's theme of religion as a justification for evil), will still have trouble seeing The Prince of Egypt as anything other than a beautiful, heartbreaking, and just phenomenal piece of art. I know it's no Shark Tale but still.",The Prince of Egypt
64,Indy-52,the best animation ever...,10,6 September 1999,"this movie, from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Pictures, is a great achievement in animated movies. It tells a story of biblical proportions (literally!) about slave Mozes' life as The Prince of Egypt, and does it in a great way. The animation is truly stunning, especially the scenes when Mozes splits up the Red Sea, and when he turns the Nile into blood (which was really kind of scary). I can't really recommend the whole family (including 7-year old kids) to go see this, but if you're over 12 years old and you know something about the story of Mozes, you'll definitely appreciate this film. I give it a 9.",The Prince of Egypt

Yes, the film has gorgeous Animation and the music by Hans Zimmer fits well with the themes of the story, but it all just felt basic to me.I appreciate the film trying to add Musical numbers into it to make it stand out from other Exodus adaptations. There's a bit of humour here and there, and the film feels perfectly paced with no scenes wasted. In the end, it simply boils down to not really being my cup of tea more than anything else I suppose. Definitely not bad though.6/10.",The Prince of Egypt

I suppose some puritans will disagree, but I thought the way each of the characters were fleshed out and made to argue his/her case was an example of great dramatization.  The best examples are the performances by Patrick Stewart, Ralph Fiennes, Danny Glover and of course Val Kilmer.The best segment is the way they use the hieroglyphs to present Joseph's back story.  That is a truly brilliant (dare I say inspired?) idea to tell the story.  And the chariot race and walk through the Red Sea are breathtaking.I think no matter what your own personal theological or spiritual stance is, you should be able to enjoy this masterful presentation of a classic story.

Over a hundred religious leaders were consulted for the sake of authenticity. While still a family film, it pulls little to no punches in depicting things such as Moses' accidental killing of an Egyptian, the destruction of Pharaoh's forces during the Parting of the Red Sea, and especially The Plagues. However, given that it was known to be an animated adaptation of the Book of Exodus, NO ONE expected it to be pretty colors and talking animals, and parents knew full well what to expect when bringing their children to see it. This was - and still is - one of the strongest selling points of this film. It's an animated take on the events in Egypt as told in the Bible, including the slaying of the firstborn sons.

It certainly stands out for its exceptional art, especially in the depictions of pharaonic Egypt (even if it mixes the Great Pyramids with Luxor), as well as the music. Although it is fairly close to the bible in terms of the characters and events, the emotional arc of the movie plays out against a decidedly non-biblical theme: the close friendship that forms between Rameses, the pharaoh's son by birth, and Moses, his adopted brother. The movie also goes to great efforts to explain (justify?) the murder of innocent Egyptian children as a response to the murder of innocent Israelite children by Ramses's father, and by depicting only one dead child: the son of Ramses himself, who has adamantly refused all of Moses's efforts to talk sense into him. While the Passover itself is largely understated, the depiction of the crossing of the Red Sea and the drowning of Pharaoh's army are exceptionally vivid, and was one of the reasons, I think, that the movie frightened my son so much; he also described it as sad.",The Prince of Egypt

It never rushes but still encapsulates all major and most relevant events in the life of Moses.The casting is absolutely brilliant.

As a result, they miss some very important and insidious problems. First, the film sends the message that it is OK to hate another race so long as you are not a member of that race. If you find out that you are actually a member of that race, then you need to join them and hate your former race as strongly as you once hated your own. But whichever race you belong to, hating different races is the order of the day! Yippee! How does this terrible message get over looked by people who like this film? Watch it again! This is exactly what is presented in the film and represents the precise motivations of its characters, especially Moses! Worst of all are all the modernistic adulterations of the original BIblical story. It represents the RHV, the ""Revised Hollywood Version"" of the Bible. I have never understood why stories that are so apparently worthy to be made into films are nevertheless not worthy to stand on their own as films! If the market draw of a film is its source material, then why not represent the source material faithfully? There's no harm in filling in the gaps of a Biblical narrative with original and entertaining stuff, but why change the explicit details of the original story themselves? As a result, the public thinks it knows something about the Bible when all it has been given is some half-baked, Hollywood revision done for the sake of marketing demographics.",The Prince of Egypt
72,zacpetch,One of the finest casts in movie history and a faithful adaptation from The Bible. What more could you want?,9,1 December 2014,"Disney had always been the driving force of animation, but in the late '90s it began to lose its way. Step forward Dreamworks with an amazing adaptation of one of The Bible's best-known episodes.Well animated and a voice cast (Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Steve Martin, Helen Mirren, Danny Glover & Patrick Stewart) that even the biggest Hollywood blockbusters would struggle to get, this is a classic in every way.The story, in case you've lived your life in a cave, tells of how a prince, Moses, learns he is not of royal birth but is in fact a Hebrew slave who was chosen by God to free his people from Egyptian slave-drivers by enacting a series of ten plagues until the Pharaoh agreed to let them go. It's the first 15 chapters of the Biblical book of Exodus that acts as the source material, but some creative liberties have been taken since this is a film.To adapt a story that is central to the faiths of every single Christian and Jew that has ever lived and make it accessible but not dumbed down is brave, but it works and gives us a good film with an incredible cast and soundtrack alike that will be rightly remembered as a classic.Whether you believe the story (as I do) or not, what we have with this film is an excellently realised take on the story of a man with a special purpose. Moses was far from perfect when God found him - He was a murderer on the run - but, though he was initially unwilling to do what was asked of him, he managed to be brave and save millions of people who would establish a nation that still has descendants to this day. Inspiring stuff.",The Prince of Egypt
73,neenahhh,DreamWorks should make more films like this!,10,18 April 2011,"I've seen this ""The Prince of Egypt"" a lot of times when I was a child. I first saw this movie when I was in school and I loved it. I then bought the VCD and I think that VCD was one that I ended up using regularly. After many years, I decided to watch it again. And I'll say this: The magic hasn't been lost. I still love this film. It's amazing. Seriously.I'd like to believe that this movie can be enjoyed be anyone and everyone. I do believe in God, but I am not overly religious. However I still enjoyed this movie immensely. I think that even non-Christians or atheists will still enjoy this movie. This movie may scare children. I know I got creeped out by one or two parts when I was younger. But other than that, it's fine.I love the soundtrack of this movie. All the songs (except for one) fit in with the movie itself and helps make it perfect. The songs aren't at all distracting and they don't just happen out of the blue. There's build-up and the songs just really go with the flow of the movie. The songs actually MAKE the movie what it is.After watching this movie again after many years, I think that I was able to understand it more and I also got to really appreciate the brilliance of it. The characters, for instance, were really written well. Especially Rameses. (SPOILER:) When I was younger, I hated Rameses. I thought that he was evil and deserved everything that happened to him. But now, I found that I was actually sympathizing with him. I mean, think about it. He was under a lot of pressure that was put onto him by his father. He just wanted to make his father proud by making Egypt great. Then suddenly, his brother, one that he grew up and shared many memories with, turns against him It must have been hard. I don't blame him for his actions. (/SPOILER) He was a well-rounded coin. There were two sides of him. I think more movies need to make their villains like Rameses here.This film was brilliant. I can't think of a simpler way to put it. It's really moving and is just amazing. DreamWorks should make more movies like this. This could rival many of Disney's films and actually level with Pixar's. Watch ""The Prince of Egypt"" now if you haven't yet.Viewed on: April 18, 2011",The Prince of Egypt
74,au_law2001,A story to be told to all ages,10,15 January 2005,"Based on Exodus of the Bible, this animated thriller brings you the story of Moses, and the freedom of the Hebrews from slavery. Excellent animation, and wonderful moments, especially the one where they go to the banquet and when Moses meets God in the form of the burning bush. I must say, they really depicted this from the Bible very accurately without causing any controversy at all, and without messing anything up, it's perfect for the religious ones, even to those Non-Christians or Non-Jewish people, and even to those not belonging to any religion at all, it's wonderful story and not to mention the songs in it. They were beautiful and memorable, I like also the song at the beginning when the Egyptians were gathering the Hebrew children, I also like the ones when the ten plagues occurred, and the one when they were finally leaving Egypt. That was wonderful. And not to say the least, the scene with Red Sea, when they were crossing it, the special effects were great.

76,Angels_Review,A rather interesting religious video,8,5 April 2014,"It's interesting when people try to create biblical stories into films, even more so when they are made for children. The bible wasn't really meant for children in the sense of most of the stories have to be altered to fit our societies ideas of what our children should know. Things like death and blood never make it into the shows and sort of make it feel unrealistic then. When I hear there is a cartoon coming out that is supposed to be biblical, I really take it with a grain of salt. I was partly right in doing so though it was still rather enjoyable to watch anyway.I love how they humanized the story of Moses and didn't just try to play if off the book of Exodus. In the book (if I remember right) we only see how Egyptians took Moses and yet we always see that the Hebrews look to him lovingly. This feels a bit unrealistic. How would you feel if one of your people treated you like a slave, left after killing someone, then came back and said that he was chosen by god to save them. You would probably be skeptical about what he was talking about. That's how they first play it off in the show and It works rather well. Another thing is that they show a deep connection with Moses and Rameses that feels perfectly like how two brothers would act.Although there are some wonderful things they have done in the story, they have somehow missed a couple things from the story that I feel make it lose in a way. I care a lot about being true to the source if you actually want to create a story so it bothers me the inaccurate parts from both the bible and history. First off is the problems with the bible, According to what I have read and what I remember, it was not the Pharaoh's wife that found Moses but the Pharaoh's daughter. Also, unlike the show, it is said that Moses was given back to his mother to nurse him for the Daughter even though she was never able to say he was hers. Moses knew all the time that he was a Hebrew, not an Egyptian though the film has a nice dream piece to have him figure out who he really was. When he does see the burning bush, unlike the film where he seems intrigued or sticks his hand in, he is supposed to be afraid until god speaks to him and tells him that he is to do things for him. When he does return to Egypt, he was not greeted with open arms by the Egyptians because he really did kill someone. He was exiled instead of left on his own.Now when we get into history part, there is at least one thing I picked up on. During the dream vision he has, they show a sun with hands. This was the Egyptian God Aten, and was supposed to be during the time of Pharaoh Akhenaten a few hundred years after the time of Moses. Aten was the only time that Egyptians believed in one God. It would not be during this time and so he would not be dreaming of it or have it drawn on the walls.The Artwork is beautifully done. The textures stand out wonderfully and the backgrounds look like nicely detailed watercolors where the CG that is put in once in a while works perfectly, adding to the show instead of taking away from it. The characters look mostly like Egyptian drawings brought to life and even some of the poses can be seen from the artwork in Egyptian walls. Unfortunately, sometimes, the characters start to lack a bit when they move around. They are wonderful when they just stand or look like they mean business, but when they do fast passed action scenes, the characters feel a bit stretched out. One or two of the characters feel like they have to small of heads and the details just seems to be copied from Disney.The music is perfect and wonderfully done, bringing the show to life though when they start singing, once in a while, sounds odd. I really don't like how Patrick Stewart does the Pharaoh's voice. Something makes me feel a little unwell when a rather British sounding man tries to play the Egyptian old man. Aaron's voice, Moses older brother, just feels rather comical as well as the strange priests Hotep and Huy. I could never take any of them seriously.",The Prince of Egypt
77,DonaldDooD,"Exodus Is Not Only Adapted, But Improved",9,31 July 2014,"The problem with even the best religious films is that, if you don't adhere to the faith, there is little to be extracted. Some stories have universal value. The Prodigal Son comes to mind. But I can't get behind faith, love of God, chastity, and conservatism.Prince of Egypt dodges those stereotypes. Its still a religious movie, but it doesn't insult those who don't believe. There's more focus on the fight for freedom, and the conflict between former brothers. The interpretations of the biblical characters give them more emotion, making them more relateable and dramatic. Moses is more sensitive, even regretful that God must bring plagues upon Egypt. Ramses is more human, ambitious, traditional, with a love for his people - and apathy for the Jews. Even this slight ambiguity is enough to make me care far more than in church.Few films use animation better than this one. Its smooth, colorful, and detailed, with amazing backgrounds. There's also a level of creativity that seems to be lost in today's Dreamworks films. The scenes of the burning bush and Passover are particularly beautiful and haunting. The soundtrack is also great. Its a favorite among many animation buffs. I still listen to ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" and ""The Plagues"".I've gotten a dozen VHS tapes of Christian cartoons growing up. They don't hold a candle to The Prince of Egypt. Trust me, you don't have to be part of an Abrahamic faith to love this. Its Dreamworks's best work, and one of the best animation has to offer.",The Prince of Egypt
78,smashattack,"A nice, accurate portrayal.",8,5 September 2002,"The Prince of Egypt is a DreamWorks film like no other.  It is based solely on the book of Exodus and, unlike most movies, tries to remain true to the book on which it is based.However, there are some minor flaws.  For instance, Aaron became Moses' spokesperson and the pharoah died in the end.  But these were changed to add some flare to the movie, and it actually helps.It is a nicely tuned visual epic.  The animation is pretty darn good, with fluid movements and believable characters.  The characters, by the way, support the film by being voiced by an all-star cast.  This provides a sort of problem since throughout most of the movie I pictured the actors' faces rather than their drawn-out counterparts.The music by Hans Zimmer is, once again, amazing.  Again and again he proves that he is an excellent artist of music.  Thrilling tunes, playful themes, and sorrowful melodies rack the soundtrack.  The songs, however, can get quite annoying, and I wanted to skip forward through some of them.The plot and storyline, taken from the Bible, are no doubt excellent.  I doubt anyone could really dislike this movie.Although not a grand epic, it is still a tale worth seeing.",The Prince of Egypt
79,DoctorSkyTower,A REALLY GOOD ANIMATED FLICK!,8,20 December 1999,"I am not partial to animated movies, much less Disney-style animated flicks (with the singing anthropomorphic animals, objects etc) so this was a rather pleasant change from the standard fare. Although there was singing, and it was boring, it was bearable! The design, especially of Moses' and Co's faces, which seemed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphics, was very effective. This was well done, probably better than Disney, and it depicted Moses life in an interesting way. Such as his time living as a prince of Egypt then in the desert as a Hebrew. And considering this is an animated feature!There were events in this film that raised it above your average Disney flick. Examples include Moses' dream when he was a young man and he learns about the persecution of the Hebrews. When he encounters god in the form of the burning bush. And of course, the parting of the Red Sea. This last piece of animation is the best I have ever seen!!  CONCLUSION: This movie is not just for the kids!!",The Prince of Egypt
80,christophershobris,One of DreamWorks strongest,10,21 September 2017,"This film is such an emotional experience, I literally cry throughout the film, not just one or two places, but throughout. If anyone says DreamWorks isn't talented or anything like that, they need to check their pulse, because this film made Disney realize what a monster DreamWorks could eventually come, but a good monster, at least for us audiences. OK, what is it that makes this film so wonderful. The idea of tackling such a sensitive topic as the story of Moses really was a risky move for DreamWorks, a film that could make or break them. Kudos, because it was so risky. They didn't shoehorn anything and gave us a fully realized, and well put together masterpiece of a film. Now here in 2017 and beyond people are starting to realize the brilliance and the majesty of the film. What works so well is the effort put into this, the music by Hans Zimmer is his best since The Lion King, and the songs are better than the songs Disney was making at the time in 1998. So much so that one was rewarded an Oscar. As of right now it is the only DreamWorks song ""When You Believe"" to win an Oscar. The animation is topnotch, about as good as The Lion King, and the story is heartwarming, and heartbreaking at times. The film isn't afraid to go to some dark places. The performances of the actors was genuine especially from Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes. Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum make an appearance which is always nice. The only problem I have is the attempt at comedy. If you can't make good comedy work in a drama film like this, don't do it at all. But of course it had to appeal to kids somewhat. That's one thing about animated films is they always have to appeal to kids one way or another, even in films that don't need the lowbrow humor for your toddler. If they took the comedy out, it would have been more impactful than it already is. This isn't the only film that does it though, a generally great film but is bombarded by needless and forced comedy. Animated films should help kids grow, not stay kids. So let some blood on screen, let murder happen on screen, life isn't always fun and sweet. But, that's the only grip, other than that, its great.

81,paulo20,Spectacular effects; ponderous pacing,6,27 December 1999,"This film definitely displayed some visual innovation.  Some of the effects were rather awe-inspiring.  However, the movie didn't really deliver on other accounts.The character animation left something to be desired for one.  Elongated faces, shortened foreheads, stork thin legs - heck, Seti looked like a stork).  Expressions seemed to exist largely of characters looking shocked and amazed and little else.The choice of story is a bit odd and some of it doesn't make much sense to me. The Hebrew God didn't seem any less of a wrathful God to me than in the Old Testament and he seemed largely to be jerking Moses and the Hebrews around.  I guess the story was a bit too un-secular for my tastes.I couldn't dig the musical numbers at all.  The tunes were forgettable and the lyrics were ridiculous.  Ugh.  Even the worst of the Disney songs don't approach the sheer awfulness of PoE's musical numbers.The most annoying aspect of this movie was its pacing.  Settings and situations were over-established, people looked at each other for long stretches and moments of grave import went on too long.  One instance is just before Moses parts the Red Sea.  I guess the thinking is since this is a big moment, it demands that Moses must pause dramatically and look around doubtfully.  I can think of no other reason for his doing this.  Still, the actual parting of the Sea was extremely well done.Overall, to give this a Siskel/Ebert type rating, I give it a thumbs up for effects animation and thumbs down for character animation, music and pacing.",The Prince of Egypt

That is why I removed it. I will try to do better now.DISCLAIMER: Of course, I know 'The Prince of Egypt' is not an actual Disney movie.SECOND DISCLAIMER: And, of course, I am not a religious person. I don't have a religion, actually.Well, my opinion about this movie hasn't changed one bit over the years. I hated it six years ago and I hate it now. Now I will try to explain why.At the beginning it actually looks like a great movie - the animation is wonderful and the voices are great, and the theme it's centered around is something every person in the world should be familiar with.However... Here is the problem: this theme is much more serious than the treatment this movie gives it. After all, it is a story that changed the world forever. The creators of 'The Prince of Egypt' turned it into a Disney kind of a family movie. They put some childish songs here, they did the animation in a Disney manner, they simplified the story and they even put some insanely stupid non-funny comic reliefs. As I've already said, I am not a religious freak. I don't believe in God the way most Christians do. And yet even I think the story deserved a more serious approach. This story is just not suitable for a kids' film, sorry. A very big part of it is about the horrible death of thousands of kids. That is why many reviewers wrote their kids started crying at the very beginning of this movie. Many kids actually feel horrified by this movie, and there is a reason for that - a story like this one has to be told in a movie rated at least PG-13. It is not good for younger audience, and it is definitely not good for a kids' movie. Making a kids' movie out of it is just wrong - it wouldn't work, and it is plain disrespectful to the Holy Bible and the religion.Sorry.",The Prince of Egypt

Seeing children and animals die on the screen is not my idea of family entertainment.

85,seige-hound,One of the best animated films out there. Very underrated.,10,16 May 2013,"(This review is originally from my blog at http://samuentagareview.blogspot.com/. Check it out if you want.)I have a long history of love for this particular film, and it continues to this day. As a Christian, the story of Moses was one of those stories that is oft told in Sunday School and the likes, and deservedly so. It is one of the biggest examples of epic in the entire Bible.The Prince of Egypt is an animated Dramatic Musical that was first released in 1998, starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes and others, and is probably the most epic family movie I've seen. It kick- started my interest in Ancient Egyptian culture and history in my youth, and is to this date the best Bible Epic i've ever seen...and it's animated.The interesting thing about POE that sets it apart from other animated movies is that it doesn't bother with the dreaded 'Disney Comic Relief Characters' that are in every other animated movie, especially after The Lion King, including non-Disney movies. The issue with these characters is that they don't add much to the story, and are really just there as distractions for the kids, as to keep them entertained through the more adult story (see Hunchback of Notre Dame). Prince of Egypt doesn't do that at all, and the closest it gets to that trope are the two High Priests, Hotep and Hoy, played by Steve Martin and Martin Short, but they come across more as creepy than funny, despite their more cartoonish design, compared to the rest of the movie.But that's not to say the movie isn't funny. It has plenty of funny moments, such as the beginning with the brotherly quarrels between Rameses and Moses. These comedic moments are limited though, and the movie feels more like a musical along the lines of Les Mis, to give a recent example, than any Disney movie clone.The music is the strongest part of the movie, and the reason I think that the film will do well on a Broadway stage. The film has one of the best openings ever, in my opinion, with the seven minute 'Deliver Us' instantly saying to the audience 'This ain't a kid's movie' with the implied deaths of thousands of children. Other songs, such as 'All I ever Wanted', 'Playing with the Big Boys', and 'The Plagues', and of course, 'When You Believe,' a song that was covered by Celene Dion and Whitney Houston for the soundtrack and became a worldwide hit. The lyrics mix perfectly with the Hans Zimmer score, creating one of the most memorable soundtracks ever written.And the story is also amazing. Most everyone in a predominantly Christian or Jewish culture, whether they follow the religion(s) or not, are familiar with the Moses story, but the way the film presents it, as a tale of two brothers who are forced to be enemies by a higher power, is a very unique interpretation of the story. The fact that it's called 'The Prince of Egypt' speaks volumes about the tone of the story. At first glance, nobody would guess 'Moses' from the title, unless they knew about the film beforehand. The reason I believe it is titled that is because Moses, being raised in an Egyptian palace his entire life, would have a massive connection to the land and people, despite his heritage. Moses would've been conflicted with himself and the love for the country he was raised in, and the culture he belongs to, and the movie presents that conflict almost perfectly.Visually speaking, the film is GORGEOUS. Every single frame is made perfectly. The throne room of the Pharoh, with the statue of Seti right next to Seti's real profile is great framing. The entire movie feels huge, every picture is scaled perfectly, and the final fifteen minutes, with the parting of the Red Sea, is one of the most epic moments in animated cinema. Watching the movie just for the visuals in itself is an enjoyable experience, even to this day, and this film is fourteen years old now.So yeah, this is probably my favorite animated movie, at least right now. What my favorite Disney movie is, I get to later.",The Prince of Egypt

It only disappoints in the story, but this is not the fault of the producers and creative team who bring us the film.. Rather, it's a problem with the biblical story and its killjoy ending.  All of that heart and drama and humanity.. the beginning and middle of this film build up to something that the audience can't wait to see.. something ultimately meaningful and thought provoking..something spiritual that will affect our lives and philosophies permanently.... and what does it come down to? 
Killing all the bad guys in a mass slaughter. Well, they don't agree with the Christian belief system, (They're backward Egyptians who have all those funky gods, right?) And they're stubborn and in the way and bothering everyone, so God just murders them all.....Really, I expect God to come up with a better solution than that.  It truly does feel like something that would happen 2000 years ago, in its insensitivity and decidedly biblical prejudice...    We hardly get any depth into Rameses' character or his inner conflict.. being presented with the choice of giving up on thousands of years of Egyptian tradition and heritage based on the testimony of a bearded derelict who has just wandered out of the desert.  We get none of the positive aspects of Egypt, a country as rich in unique culture as any other, because it's presented here as the source of evil.  We can't have the bad guys presented in the appropriate human context, because the audience is supposed to hate them.      Please keep in mind that this isn't Dreamworks' fault.  They kept to the Old Testament as well as could be expected. Their only folly was selecting this particular downer of a story to make into a feature film.  It IS eye candy, spectacular in its effects and appearance, and should be admired for this.  The star spangled cast is somewhat wasted, as most of the dialogue is everyday business and there are few opportunities for talent to shine.  The musical numbers, though heartfelt, feel out of place amid the severity and carnage of the somber storyline.  Still, the film is an interesting study in animation and human behavior...... But it isn't one for the kiddies, particularly the scene where God discriminantly murders a slew of innocent Egyptian children. ...This film definitely highlights the evil side of the Almighty.  It's nothing for anybody, particularly Christians, to be proud of.  In fact, any Christian with a sense of humanity should be ashamed of this dark chapter in religious history. It's cruelty and vengeance all around, and hardly anybody gets away looking good.   Yes, slavery is evil.  But murder is evil, too, folks. ... Oh wait, but God is exempt from the rules.  That's right.. Our sins count but his don't...",The Prince of Egypt
87,BibChr,This telling of the Exodus history raises animation to a new level,10,26 December 1998,"""Prince of Egypt"" is so satisfying on so many levels.  Artistically, it is epochal in quality.  As a feature, it is more like an animated movie than it is a cartoon.  As a telling of the story of Moses and the Exodus, it is remarkably faithful in spirit (while bobbling or fabricating a few details; see the book).  So many factors work together to make this a  MUST-SEE movie, particularly for anyone who has groused about the quality of movie coming out of Hollywood in recent years.",The Prince of Egypt
88,tay-sedai,I'm not into God but I can still enjoy this movie,7,1 June 2013,"Back in 2004 I saw this movie for the first time, and then I re-watched it in 2007 (and possibly again since then, I don't know). Here is what I had to say after my first re-watch:""Now, I knew this was based on something from the Bible, but I just have to say it didn't make me admire God any more than I did already. Not that I believe in God. But seriously, how can you admire a being that would happily kill off half a city's first-born children just to show them who's boss? Still, if I ignored the whole God aspect, I could enjoy the movie. And at least Moses cared about the dead kids.""I would also like to add now, in retrospect, that I love the soundtrack to this movie. Hans Zimmer is an excellent composer and I pretty much always love his work. And the other songs on this soundtrack are enjoyable as well.",The Prince of Egypt
89,dissident320,A visually spectacular movie with an unremarkable story,6,26 August 2017,"Apparently the Netflix version of this is based off of scans of the 35mm film rather than an actual digital master. Despite that, this movie still holds up visually. I think it looks spectacular and you can appreciate how much effort was put into making it.The voice cast is fine, although I somewhat question the decision to have Val Kilmer as Moses. There's something a little goofy about his brother being voiced by Ralph Fiennes that I couldn't get behind. I think him being British and much more noble sounding and then Val Kilmer just sounding like himself. I will say this movie is guilty of not really getting performances out of excellent actors. The majority of them just sound like themselves and aren't really doing much beyond saying their lines. And the songs need to be mentioned as well. Most of them are fun and have a very Disney-vibe. I believe Ralph Fiennes sings his parts but for some reason Val Kilmer is dubbed by someone with a bland but I guess more traditional singing voice. Because obviously he can sing as he has shown in previous movies such as 'Top Secret' and 'The Doors'.As far as the story goes, I guess it mostly follows the biblical one. I haven't read the bible and I'm not familiar with much of this besides the burning bush and parting the sea. It plays out okay but doesn't really surprise or lean into the brother rivalry in a sophisticated way.This movie is completely worth seeing just for the visuals alone. An absolute shame that it has not been given a proper Blu-ray release. But the Netflix version is decent and doesn't rob you of too much of what it probably looked like in the theatre.",The Prince of Egypt
90,amiranda-39274,Behold the Power of God: A Deep Analysis,10,5 April 2020,"This has to be one of the earliest movies I ever saw as a kid and I think it defined my life from that point on. The story of Moses and the exodus, is already an epic story, and to see this movie reenact it, and meet every expectation I ever had, was glorious. This movie was the most expensive animated movie made during its time, with a large crew and cast of A listers all doing their part to breath life into this animated movie. This movie possesses several important themes such as Faith, Hope, Responsibility, and Identity, which just elevate the film beyond mere animation, it brings it to life.The Characters: Moses is a complex character, starting from him being the prince of Egypt, he is just a immature spoiled man that is kind but ignores the suffering of the laves, but that changes when he finds out he is the son of slaves, he leaves Egypt to find purpose and discovers the greatest calling of, becoming Gods messenger, the transformation of this character is very organic and endearing. I truly love that instead of making Moses and Rameses rivals or enemies since childhood, they made them loving brothers. This adds so much weight and depth to the rest of the movie that never fails to get me emotional.
The dialogue is truly compelling to the point each character, no matter how little their role is in this Epic, are memorable and play an important part in Moses journey. What elevates these characters, is the fantastic artistry of true human emotion, through subtle movements and expressions, you feel their pain, you feel their faith and you feel their triumph.The Cast: I still slap my head every time I realize who the voice actors are, there are so many iconic actors in this movie, and im left shocked with how perfectly cast they were. This has to be one of the greatest casts ever for an animated movie. Despite all of the characters being played by iconic A listers, im surprisingly never irked, every voice fits perfectly and I don't even think of the actor voicing them ( well accept for jeff Goldblum). Go check out IMBDS cast list of this movie!
The Animation:
This is one of those movies where the art used is so spectacular that you need to pause the scene to analyze every inch of detail the animators put into brining this animated movie to life. Some of the special effects look completely otherworldly, such as burning bush, the plagues, the angel of death, the pillar of fire , and the red sea. These sequences look so photorealistic that you feel immersed. there is so much creativity, like Moses has this stunning dream sequence with hieroglyphs that never fails to impress me. Everything is on a grand scale in this movie, some of the landscapes are purposefully shown to be grandiose to dwarf the characters and show the intimidation of Gods creation. There were no shortcuts taken, the animators did everything in their power to bring this story and the miracles of God to life, the parting of the red sea scene took 2 years to make! its just 5 minutes long! These people deserve all the praise they can get! Every frame has extraordinary detail and scope and gives this story the grandeur it deserves.The Music: The songs never fail to get to me emotional and to start praying to God. Hans zimmer is truly an artist, some of the soundtrack just feels like it was made by God himself. The music enhances all the visuals, there are some moments that just feel completely otherworldly. Now unlike other animated movies, the songs used here actually add to the story, and show the passage of time and the thoughts of the characters, to the point I must examine each song quickly. ( if your still reading, thank you)1. Deliver Us: The song start by showing heart wrenching plight of the slaves it then transitions to Moses mother yocheved ( voiced by Ofra Hanza, one of the greatest vocalists of all time!), she saves Moses from the infant genocide, by placing him in a basket in the river, his sister Miriam then follows him down the river to make sure he stays safe and the song ends with Moses being adopted by the queen, and Miriam saying a prayer for Moses to come back and deliver them as well.
2. All I ever wanted: Moses has just discovered he's a Hebrew and struggles with his own identity, ending with him having a stunning dream sequence.
3. Through heavens eyes, discusses the worth of a man and how everything in this world has extreme value. Its serves as a montage from Moses as a juvenile to the man who will be worthy of being Gods messenger. It never fails to inspire me and put a smile on my face.
4. Your playing with the Big boys now; A truly enjoyable villain song, where Steve martin and martin short try to replicate and out do Gods miracles. But all it does is prove their false gods and trickery is nothing compared to Gods power.
5. The Plagues: displays how terrifying God can be, and that he deserves our respect. As we watch the horrors inflicted upon the Egyptians, you can feel very bad for the Egyptians, but you know its because God needs to force them to release the slaves. It also serves as the beginning of Moses and Rameses confrontation, which is just emotionally powerful, as you see the pain Moses is in to be causing so much destruction to his brother and past home.6. When you believe: This song represents the ambition and beauty of the entire movie, it represents the power of the human spirit, to always have faith and perseverance no matter the odds. While the movie version is fantastic, the Mariah carey and Whitney Houston version is beyond this world.The Spirituality:
Whether you believe in God or not, this movie finds a way to touch your spirit, and might begin to change your mind. The music and songs are just heart wrenching and are so profound. The exodus, shows the slaves walking towards the ocean as a family, its truly a beautiful moment. The burning bush scene is so awe inspiring and ethereal, you as the viewer might believe you are in the presence of God. There are so many pivotal moments in the movie that make you feel you are indeed witnessing the acts of God. His power should be terrifying, beautiful and awe inspiring all at the same time, and the creators succeeded at that.To this day, I will say that this is the best interpretation of the exodus story, despite my love for Charlton heston's ten commandments. This movie just makes me understand this timeless story in such a way, that I feel i was there when Moses lived. Everyone who was involved in the creation of this movie, achieved perfection and breached the boundaries of animation, and most importantly honored God. The making of this movie is also truly fantastic and i recommend watching that video after you watch the movie. I consider this one of the greatest animated movies ever made, its on my top 10 list, and I'm starting to believe that this might be the greatest animated movie ever made, which hurts me even more knowing that this movie is considered underrated. This movie exposed me to the cruelty of slavery but also the power of faith, hope and the human spirit. The movie has true depth, it has so many layers of meaning and artistry,its what every animated film should strive to be, its not about making toys or meeting a quota of money its about making a film that can touch the soul and inspire people to do great things. The movie is a cinematic masterpiece, but on a personal level it will touch your soul, and will make you believe in miracles and God.",The Prince of Egypt
91,SebMoz,The peak of animation,10,26 December 2020,"Before DreamWorks became the commercialized company it is today, they tried making some 2D animated movies, as a ""take that"" to Disney and an attempt to build a studio capable of rivaling said Disney. Today, DreamWorks admittedly doesn't have nearly the same respect that Disney or Pixar does, but when they try their hardest, when they put all their effort into creating a movie which will stand the test of time no matter how changed the industry becomes, there is not a single other studio capable of rivaling their brilliance. And nowhere has this ever been showcased more clearly, than in The Prince of Egypt. This is probably the only animated movie I've ever seen, where I genuinly cannot find anything I don't like. This is a retelling of the biblical story of Moses, yet it works for anyone, even a natural sceptical person like me. DreamWorks managed to make a movie that can appeal to everyone, from deeply religious people to atheists. There's not a single line of dialogue in this movie that doesn't work, not a single shot that doesn't look good. The animation is so expressive and gorgeous, and the mix of borderline revolutionary 3D effects and 2D character models makes for some of the most breathtaking sequences I've ever seen. The incredible score and fenomenal songs make all that even better as well.The characters in this movie are some of the best written in animation history. Moses is such a great main character. He's sympathetic, well-defined and carries some very intersting burdens. I love seeing him change into a better person over the course of the movie. Rameses is equally fantastic a character, to the point where he might actually be the most well developed and compelling villain in any animated movie, yes even better than the best Disney villains. His struggles with being told he's not good enough by his father makes him very relatable, and even though he becomes a ruthless leader, one can't help but feel sorry for him. He didn't choose to be a farao, it was the burdens placed upon his shoulders from he was a boy that ended up defining him. The relationsship between Moses and Rameses is portrayed so realistically and feels so genuine. Their brotherly love is so engaging, and the growing rift between them is heartbreaking and compelling. The voice actor's performances are virtually flawless, especially Ralph Fiennes and Val Kilmer. The side characters are great as well, and the supporting cast does everything in their power to make each exchange of dialogue memorable and immersive. The pacing is perfect, the movie always manages to walk the fine line between fast and slow perfectly, and every new scene builds upon the existing story and advances the plot while being entertaining in their own right. And even though this movie has a much more serious subject matter than other animated movies, the comic relief feels natural and isn't shoved in your face like in other movies.I could go on and on about this movie, but I think I've made my point pretty clear. There has never been a movie quite like this, especially not an animated one. It's one of those movies that just gets better and better everytime I watch it. It's practially a perfect movie, one of the very few I would give that title. Everything works to an amazing degree, and I have no doubt that it belongs in my top 5 movies of all time. It's just remarkable.",The Prince of Egypt

93,impendingdd,Top Tier Animation/Musical by Dreamworks,10,21 March 2020,"What a picture this is. They don't make them like they used to and that's a fact. This 2D animated film is not only one of the best drama epic's I've ever seen, it's also the best musical, and even the best animated. You don't have to know the Bible or be a Christian to enjoy or understand this film. The voice casting is perfect, the story is riveting and moving, uplifting, and displayed gorgeously with thorough animation and an awesome original score and soundtrack that's just as moving and powerful. I'd place this next to Passion of the Christ as a force of Christian based story telling. It works for children as much as it does for adults. The best story of Moses I've ever came across, if you're ever feeling down about your place in life or about yourself I recommend watching this movie to enliven your spirits. Salvation lies within the heart of this film to a person of any background. The grand moral of the story is: everyone matters, everyone has a purpose.",The Prince of Egypt
94,films-22537,This is some very dark material to try and turn into a fun animated family musical.,8,3 March 2020,"I liked the fact that the story instead of emphasizing the religious aspects, grounded itself with the relationship of the two brothers. Missing though was a few more scenes to show how the world they lived in operated so we know the status quo on a grander scale more than Rameses wants to please his dad and Moses found out he's Hebrew and decides slavery is bad. Also, another point of view character to show us the suffering and hardship of being a slave and maybe the death of that character also being a turning point. Moses should have spent more time with people that are miserable and have terrible lives to really show that he has to take-action, instead of a talking burning bush being the only thing that pushes him to confront his brother. I'm not saying we don't know all of these things, but in the context of telling an emotionally compelling story it would have had me more invested. With that sad there's only some long and dark a kids movie can be so I know why they didn't do it. Still it's well told story that is visually pleasing. A very good and underrated film, but again if it would have gone all the way and made this an epic 2-2:30 hour film and fleshed things out more, it could have been a classic people revisited every year. I watched it recently for the first time, but this is something I will definitely revisit in time and I think I will like it more with multiple viewings.",The Prince of Egypt
95,m-ozfirat,Folklore treated as fact,1,19 January 2014,"First of all I am not being insensitive to people's beliefs but this film is based on a story marketed as fact. It is based on a political conflict that is not important to us today and only exists in a biased traditional account. The Egyptians are shown as evil, despotic and barbaric. Egypt was the most advanced, enlightened and sentimental civilisations at the time. It was a place were slaves had equal rights and were more servants then labourers as many Egyptians then would be unemployed due to seasonal routine of their works for the state. Slaves also became part of the family and there was no prejudice on race. Exodus in was written centuries after the events it describes and in reality from a political objective of Egypt's Canaanite enemies. In History it is most likely based upon the Hyksos occupation of the Nile Delta and probably on Akhenaton. My opinion is that this film encourages people to hate other people because of their race and difference in culture because a deity has made them "" a chosen race"" and kills innocent people in the process despite their degree of high culture. What hypocrisy and arrogance and yet as one reviewer pointed relevantly when Jews and Christians come to criticising a different religion that's palatable but when the same is done back they get all haughty and denialist.",The Prince of Egypt
96,StartingAllOver14,My review of Prince of Egypt,7,1 October 2007,"It's good that Dreamworks wanted to take a risk and make a animated feature based from the Bible. The result is ""Prince of Egypt"" (a little weird title, by the way), which is a watchable, epic, but also a unstable film.I'm gonna mention the bad things first; Hans Zimmer is a great composer, but the score in this movie is very dissipated.The tone of this film is too dark, too dismal and dissipated and the transitions from the light to the serious moments are too sudden.Although the character animation is great, the animators are overacting with the characters facial expressions (comparing to other animated movies where they're good at facial expressions, for example ""Pocahontas"").The songs are good (with exception of ""Deliver Us"" and ""When You Believe) and Stephen Scwartz lyrics are recognizable, but I'm still considering that this movie could be better without songs, since it is a epic Bible/David Lean like film.OK, enough complaining about this picture. I enjoyed ""Prince of Egypt"". It has some great, epic moments, both light and dark. SPOILER: Even it takes some few liberties, it remains true to the Exodus story and it shows Moses from a more personal side. (SPOILERS OVER). The character I liked most was Tzipporah. The voice talents does a good job. The background animation is absolutely stunning. Despite some weaknesses, ""Prince of Egypt"" is worth watching",The Prince of Egypt
97,T-10,more than I bargained for,10,20 December 1998,"The Prince of Egypt, as presented by Dream Works SKG, would make Cecil B. DeMille and Andrew Lloyd Webber proud.  First let me say that the soundtrack was reminiscent of a Broadway show.  The music was well written and presented and relevant to the movie.  The presentation of the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea were spectacular.  The animation both close-up and distant were excellent.  The close-up showed the wide range of emotions albeit in an ""animated"" way passion, fear, pain, anger,  love, and joy while the distant shots of the mass of people looked real. The water in the scenes was perfect especially the parting of the Red Sea.  The voices especially Mr. Kilmer (Moses) and Mr. Fiennes (Ramses) were well done.  The relationship between the two characters is the real find in this film.  The movie makes this  conflict between brothers as well as friends central---love that cannot be.  In some ways the movie makes Ramses a character for which you can sympathize.  A story where people are caught by the role they must play.  This applies to Moses as well.  Oh, I forgot the animation in the building scenes with the intricacies of the scaffolding--impressive.  This was a great movie with a great story to which the author of Exodus, Moses, could relate. I know some artistic license was taken--I think in the killing of Egyptian by Moses--but all in all it seems to be a fairly accurate telling of the story.  I would like to thank all those involved and it was one of the longest credits I've seen.  This movie may well become a classic.  Four stars!",The Prince of Egypt
98,pmcollectorboy,"Flawed, but awesome all the same",8,23 September 2000,"Okay. I'll admit that this movie won't appeal to everybody. It's not exactly a great movie to show to young kids, and it is slightly about religion. The attempts at humor in this movie were rather hokey, and some of the songs were kinda bad. It's also too musical. The computer images were overdone, and there was a tad too much Hollywood in it. But once you push all that and the voice acting aside, this is an awesome movie. Some of the scenes are breathtaking and awe inspiring. Other scenes will move you. Still other scenes will invoke sheer terror. Despite what many people say, watch this movie for yourself if you haven't already. Odds are good you will like this. It may not be perfect, but it is still awesome.",The Prince of Egypt
99,keesha45,Well-done remake of epic masterpiece,8,3 April 2008,"While not of the caliber of C.B.'s THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, this animated version does a fine job in recreating the story of the Passover and of the life of the second-greatest Biblical hero of all time (if you don't remember who's number one, you must have slept through way too many Sunday sermons.) At the time it was made, this was the most expensive full-length animated feature ever made. Part of the reason was the assemblage of an incredible array of vocal talent. Val Kilmer, who had previously brought rich characterization to the roles of Batman and Doc Holliday, headed a magnificent cast not duplicated in an animated feature since Disney's THE JUNGLE BOOK thirty years earlier. While this reviewer didn't think the visual elements were as good as the aural parts, the film was still very entertaining and very faithful to the narrative of the true story, some parts of which the original writer, Moses himself, would not recognize. Most of the audience at the Lidgerwood Presbyterian Church where this picture was shown may not have felt that PRINCE rates as an animated masterpiece to equal films like FANTASIA and SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS which they had seen when they were the same target age or thereabouts as for this film. Still, I would recommend this as an excellent way for children (and adults) to learn about a part of history that is still remembered as an integral part of a rite of the Jewish faith ever since, and that led to the founding of a great nation and its rich cultural heritage.

100,michaelf,Artistic license -- and then some!,7,28 December 1998,"Warning!  Any similarities between ""Prince of Egypt"" and the Torah is unintentional and purely coincidental.  But at least the makers of this film had the good sense to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie. With DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"" there was not only no disclaimer, but he actually tried to pass it off as an accurate depiction of the biblical account!But just looking at ""Prince of Egypt"" as just a movie, I rate it better than average.",The Prince of Egypt
101,gus120970,An epic tale from B.P (Before Pixar),8,30 April 2006,"Well, not quite. Pixar was very commercially established, if not quite a household name when Dreamworks invested in Prince of Egypt, but it was the Disney model they were seeking to emulate, and basically outdo in this retelling of the story of Exodus. Looking back on it, it is something of a shame that it represented one of the last of a breed of somewhat serious family animation films combining the look and feel of cel animation with the best that computer animation technology had to offer and that point. Since that point, and in the face of diminishing returns for traditional stories retold in animation, the Pixar/Shrek model has been dominant and looks set to be. However, Prince of Egypt will remain a classic, whatever trends and fashions prevail. Its pastel colours and pencilled line make it feel like a breathing, moving version of those kids bible stories books you may have been given in your youth. Throughout there is artistic and stylistic inventiveness, from the hieroglyphic dream sequence to the Magician's production number. The narrative, if there was any danger of it being dry and dusty is remarkably robust and the adoptive brother and demanding father angles play to modern sensibility, along with a moral racial subtext that is quite definitely late C20 America. It is the set pieces that propel the movie into a special place. Behold the power of CGI! Enabled to part the Red Sea in a moment of climactic spectacle Cecil B De Mille could only have dreamed of. But there are more subtle, equally powerful sequences like the depiction of the burning bush and the plague on the first born that are about as affecting as a cartoon can hope to get. See this movie even if the subject matter has no apparent interest for a masterclass on feature-length animation.",The Prince of Egypt
102,toutouguy,Love,10,8 January 2020,"I loved this film. Moses and the exodus from Egypt is an interesting story in the bible and I believe the animation portrays the real events fairly well in summary. Of course some historical events may be off and, no, they did not speak English, but you can begin to understand the events that unfolded in real life.The animation got a lot of cultural things surprisingly right so you can tell they put a lot of work into the film..Quality story, memorable music and very emotional/spiritual.

103,John K.-2,"If you like musicals, you should definitely watch this",9,7 March 2005,"I watched Prince of Egypt at the cinema. ""OK"", I thought, ""it's a well-made cartoon. Better than the average Christian movie, but not worth recommending to anyone"".And then I bought the soundtrack CD, and it's one of my top five favourite musicals of all time, a powerful story told in music that ranges from heart-wrenching to inspiring, right up there with Les Miserables and the rest. Now whenever I watch the film, I imagine I'm watching a musical being performed, and from that point of view, the cartoons work just fine ... for what else are actors in musicals but two-dimensional foils for the music? (Well, maybe the fat lady who sings isn't exactly 2-D :-) ).A couple of points to note: it's not an evangelical Christian movie, it just retells the Old Testament story that stars Moses, Pharoah, and God, with a few embellishments such as a chariot race. In fact, the DVD points out that the filmmakers consulted with Christians, Jews and Muslims to make sure the script fitted all traditions.

104,LDB_Movies,Incredible animation and beautiful music catapult this film to the Best of 1998 list.,8,24 December 1998,"This is perhaps the best animated musical film I have ever seen.  Dream Works has done what no one would have suspected-- beat Disney at their own game.  Sure there are a few ""formula"" moments-- like the humorous villains singing a tune.  But then there are many more ""break the formula"" moments-- no cute singing animals, and the use of Hebrew prayers in several scenes, to name a few.  The animation is incredible, especially during the chariot race sequence and the parting of the Red Sea.  The voice-overs are flawless.  The story is simplified but the film does not play down to the audience-- the horrors of slavery are shown and emphasized. The music is beautiful, especially the opening number, ""Deliver Us"".  I predict 2 Oscars for the music alone.  One of the best films of 1998.  See it.",The Prince of Egypt
105,swellframe17,Exodus as an animated film.,6,6 July 2014,"2 1/2 out of 4 stars.Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells' ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a re-telling of the Exodus tale from the Bible. It's an unusual American animated film. Although it was produced by DreamWorks, it feels like a Disney film. It looks like a Disney film and has songs written by Stephen Scwartz and Hans Zimmer. The film is an interesting juxtaposition of the Disney musical film combined with Bible. Sometimes it works, and other times it doesn't. First, the animation is quite beautiful. It is stunning at times and has a grand scope thanks to it being hand drawn. There is some awkward 3-dimensional animation at times, but it didn't hinder the film too much. For the most part, it is a visual treat.I'm not a big fan of the Exodus story. It's a my God is better than yours tale. The story is not as accepting and can be cruel at times. However, ""The Prince of Egypt"" has a little more humanity and complex characters. Thanks to the cast, these characters feel real. I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes's voice work the most. Ramseses can easily be turned into a one dimensional villain (look at Cecil B. DeMile's ""The Ten Commandments""). Fiennes, though, gives Ramseses more complexity and more humanity. The only awkward voice casting to me was Val Kilmer being cast as both Moses and God. I think there is trouble mixing this story with song and dance musical numbers. It was weird seeing animated characters sing about whose God is better and people being killed while other characters are singing. It seemed inappropriate at times. Its hard to transition from someone being killed to singing about miracles and this version didn't hold up to me. My favorite part where I thought the music, story, and imagery worked is the first 10 minutes of the film. The song is called ""Deliver Us"" and it sets up Moses' story. It's a wonderful, but dark, montage that I thought was the strongest musical part of the film. The Exodus tale is a hard story to tell. If you were to choose between ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""The Prince of Egypt,"" I would say watch ""The Prince of Egypt."" It is more concise and has complex characters. It's a very well-drawn film that will keep you visually interested. The film is dark for kids at times. A lot of people die, but it doesn't focus on the violence. ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a good way to introduce kids to the story of Exodus, but the film has its flaws that may not hold up for adults.",The Prince of Egypt
106,DrewAlexanderR1,No Need for a Retelling,8,17 August 2015,"This Universal Picture tells the story of Moses from the Book of Exodus. There have been many adaptations of this story to the big screen, most recently Exodus of Gods and Men, but this animated picture will forever rank number one. The story is amazingly well written with flowing scenes and excellent dialogue. The voice actors on cast were superb: Val Kilmer and Moses, Ralph Fiennes as Rameses and Patrick Stewart as Seti were the standouts. Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah, Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Jeff Goldblum as Aaron, and Danny Glover as Jethro were amazing compliments to the cast. While other renditions of the story of Moses and the Exodus play heavily on the violence in the story and the plagues as a centerpiece, The Prince of Egypt focuses on the relationship between Moses and Rameses and how Moses handles the mission as bringer of God's wrath to the place he once called home. The Prince of Egypt does not shy away from slavery and crimes against the slaves that occurred. Quite admirably it depicts it in a very artistic way. The scenery is top notch and the music numbers are quite good. Many may think of this movie as one to let the kids see but for those adults who watch it they will be happy they did. After seeing film there's there's no need for a retelling.",The Prince of Egypt

109,Rovin,A waste of great animation,6,12 April 2000,"After watching this film I had to ask: what was the point? The Bible does not have enough fantastic elements in it to sustain an animated feature, unlike say,  the Illiad or the Odyssey. Furthermore, the characters in the bible are very broadly drawn--and certainly not that involving if you treat it as a storybook as opposed to a  religious text. I was impressed by the animation--but that was about it...The Bible does not have many supernatural elements in it--and so the film seems like straight live action--with scenes of people standing around talking.. Boring. Furthermore, it looks like Dreamworks was attempting to please everybody with a story that has some fundamental problems with its ethics--at least to a modern audience. The god of the Old Testament was a very harsh war god without the touches of humour or sympathy you find in the Zeus of the Greeks. The filmmakers attempted to soften the brutal punishments of the Hebrew God by having Moses be compassionate to the Egyptians--but this doesnt help much.. You leave the theater not rejoicing that the Hebrews are freed, but wondering about the terrible punishments that are inflicted upon the men, women, children and animals of Egypt to reach that end.",The Prince of Egypt

111,joelmulder96,This should be here,7,3 May 2021,"First, I should note that I am a Christian. As I am also an avid movie fanatic, I have to admit that Christian flicks tend to be very very bad in a number of ways. I have grown to admire the ways in which non-Christian films insert religious themes or questions in a subtle manner, as there are very few films that overtly promote maintaining a Christian message and end up failing on multiple fronts. Prince of Egypt does not do that. What's more, the film even managed to gain popularity well beyond the Christian communities. The film won an Oscar for Original Song and scored an Oscar nomination for Best Score. Personally, I didn't care for the music, but I have to admit that I was surprised by its quality and accurate tone. It has the power to invite non-Christians into an epic biblical story and for non-Christians to deconstruct the VeggieTales-like image that many may hold of this dark story. So it has something to offer for both parties, and I am really glad that its here.",The Prince of Egypt
112,colm-hearne365,A very underrated animated classic,9,10 July 2016,"The Prince of Egypt has always been one of my childhood favourites because I remember even seeing it in the cinema, and even back then I thought it was a great movie. But I can't imagine why it's so underrated. I mean sure, it might've been a hit when it first came out, but pretty much everything about it is just epic: the story (even though it's taken from the Bible), the animation, the characters, the music, the visuals, songs and even the voice-acting. I mean a lot of big actors like Val Kilmer, Sandra Bullock, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Patrick Stewart all starred in this movie.I think one of my favourite things about this movie is how the characters develop, particularly with Moses and Ramses. Like Moses starts out as a goofy, reckless, young prince who likes to play pranks. But when he finds out that he's Hebrew, he becomes more of a sympathetic and insecure character. But when he is to return to Egypt to free the slaves, he becomes a very determined leader. As for Ramses, he starts out as young prince who wants to live up to his father's expectations. But since he loves Moses as his brother, he can also be sympathetic as well. But when Moses asks Ramses to let his people go, he becomes very much like a villain; hostile and ruthless. Also the conflict and relationship between Moses and Ramses adds to a lot of the drama into the film because it's like something from a Shakespeare play. They're both brothers and care about each other, but they reluctantly have to against each other.One of my favourite scenes in this film is the burning bush scene because it's one of the scenes that shows how beautiful and impressive the visuals are. I mean it doesn't really look like fire, but it looks like something not of this world and the voice-acting by Val Kilmer(who also plays Moses) is very well done because he makes the voice of God sound very powerful but also loving and caring and soothing at the same time. But one of the things that bothers me is that the plot seems a little rushed, but that often happens in animated musicals. But the songs help tell the story and tell what the characters are going through. Also, The Prince of Egypt is a lot more dramatic and darker compared to other animated features, like there's not much comedy later on in the film but not like that bothers me.All in all, The Prince of Egypt is a powerful, beautiful and impressive epic that should be more appreciated.",The Prince of Egypt
113,MovieRat-2,Simply the Best Exodus...yet,8,30 September 1999,"I find it hard to believe that people are bashing this movie for one poor reason or another.  Don't trust these reviews.  It seems as though these people are doing this simply because this is a biblical story.  Two words to these people, ""Grow Up.""
I first learned of this film when the trailer came out.  During the trailer I was wondering what was this film going to be about...then at the very end they showed the parting of the Red Sea (the most awe inspiring scene I have ever seen) and I knew right away I was in for a treat.I gave this film an 8 out 10 not because of the voices or because I didn't agree with the history or because I didn't like the songs...I gave it a ten because I was displeased how they changed the Exodus story.  For instance: Aaron was depicted as Moses's antagonist (along with Pharoh) instead of being the ""right hand man"" that he was in the Bible.  I was also displeased with the ""burning bush"" scene...I was hoping for it to be longer and I don't recall ""God"" ever saying the most important line, ""I am what I am.""  Also they left out the sign were Moses makes his hand leprous (but I guess it was sort of appropriate to leave that out consdidering it would have been gross).  I felt that the Ten Plagues would have been better if they were all shown in chronological order instead of being all lumped together in a single song (but to do that the movie would have been too long, oh well.) Those were my main gripes and why I gave the film an 8.The story is still true to the ""spirit"" of the Exodus, but it is not the Exodus.What I especially enjoyed was seeing a new twist to the story.  Up until now, Rameses and Moses have been shown as enemies since they were children...but what if they were no enemies but the closest of brothers. This provided a unique chance to comtiplate exactly what did happen during Moses's early years. The Bible doesn't tell us of his childhood so we are left to speculate.I thoroughly enjoyed the music, especially the opening before we meet Moses's mother.  The music flowed with the story nicely and I find nothing wrong with them...maybe they are too long but what do you expect from a musical?Animation was superb...enough said.I will reconmend this for anybody.  If you have seen the Ten Commandments, don't expect to see a remake of it here.  This is a totally, and I think better, telling of the Exodus story.  Parents watch this with your kids, they will ask questions during and after the film so be prepared to answer them.",The Prince of Egypt

My only complaint is that I wish the makers had had a bit stronger conviction for their film. At the end, after all the credits have run, three verses of scripture, from the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Koran are displayed. Sadly, most people have left by that time. These should have been placed at the beginning or, at the very least at the beginning of the end credits.

The story, the voice acting, the animation, it was all faultless, and though the songs took a bit of getting used to (they didn't seem to have that sweet, flowing quality I was used to seeing in most cartoon musicals) the soundtrack fits the film incredibly well, with the obvious standout song of 'there can be miracles' made famous by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. One fault I did have however was the script, which at times felt slightly awkward, but the voice actors did the best with what they had, and that small fault is completely swept away by all the great aspects this film has to offer. One of my favourite parts personally was the portrayal of the relationship between Moses and the Pharaoh, the anguish and stubbornness of both coming across well, and most importantly, the viewer can understand where both characters come from, sad that such a close friendship could be reduced to what it was. I thought the film was magical, and really look forward to watching it again.",The Prince of Egypt

The sister began to sing a song that Moses remembered from his mom singing to him when he was a baby. That set off Moses to fight for the Jews against the Egyptians who had been enslaving the Jews. He cannot stand the sight of seeing the helpless Jews painfully work. He realized being part of your real family that is poor is better than being rich in a family that is not your own.

120,leandros,Dreamworks deserves a standing ovation,9,2 June 1999,"I definitely did get more than I bargained for with Prince of Egypt. Very elaborately thought, this movie is a must, I say, for every kid who has ever heard of Moses and the Red Sea, and for everyone who wants to see a state-of-the-art animation film. Two scenes especially, cause gooseflesh: the slaughter of the firstborn and the opening of the Red Sea. With the Ten Commandments as the only movie before to depict these, it was eccentric to see an animation cause such emotions. One more thing worth mentioning; how can one make such a beautiful dream sequence? How can one reflect inner conflict so successfully?Some say that Steven Spielberg payed tribute to his Jewish heritage with this animation. Well, they may not be wrong. But perhaps he was entrapped at the paradox between the Bible's depiction of Moses, the prophet, and his feelings probably as a child towards Moses, the Prince of Egypt, a human being with feelings and emotions. He is not to blame. Who would have thought before that the Pharaoh with whom Moses fought was the very guy who was Moses' step brother?All in all, this film inevitably makes the viewer go home, grab the Bible and go over Exodus again. A standing ovation for Dreamworks, and pathetic remarks for Disney, for falling way behind their biggest rival.Lastly, for those who have doubts about Hebrews working as slaves in Egypt, well, both the Bible and Quran say so, ""if you believe"".Oh, and Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are terrible performers with their song while Ofra Haza just beats them by herself.

But this film is nowhere close to a disaster. It's not only good, it's miraculous. It keeps the songs to a minimum and when there are songs, they're incredibly moving. The music is Hans Zimmer at his best. What really upsets me is that no one talks about it anymore. It's a 2D animated film that uses 3D animation, backgrounds, and visual effects as an aid as opposed to a substitute. It's one of those forgotten films that deserves a comeback of some sort.",The Prince of Egypt

I saw cuts from Ben-Hur, The 10 Commandments, and a number of other films. The characters were handled unevenly, with some being well handled and others--let's face it--badly drawn. This failing isn't just DreamWorks', Disney also has been doing remakes of live action films in animation, and the results have been similar. I'd rate PRINCE OF EGYPT about the same as I rated POCAHONTAS or HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME. They are stories that are not suitable for animated musicals, and it's too bad that the new studio makes the same mistakes as the old one.",The Prince of Egypt

127,marcofranchino,Animation masterpiece,9,29 May 2020,"Egyptian Prince Moses conducts a reckless life careless of the troubles is causing to other people (for example accidentally destroying a temple during a chariot race together with his older brother Ramses, heir to the throne). He accidentally learns of his identity as a Hebrew and his life has an abrupt stop. At this time Hebrew are enslaved in Ancient Egypt. Moses changes, at first refusing his adopting family and high position for a secluded simple life but later learns his destiny to become the chosen deliverer of his people. This will lead to an inevitable confrontation with Ramses, the new Pharaoh leaving them apart for ever.This movie is outstanding on many points of view. Animation is distinctive and impeccable. Many scenes are pure works of art. The scene where, in a nightmarish dream, Moses discovers his father Paraoh Seti ordered the killing of the newborn Hebrew boys is both beautiful and terryfing. The scenes showing the plagues are majestic. This must be coupled with amazing and moving songs like ""When you believe"".
Dynamics among characters are really believable. Character growth for Moses is outstanding with a complete arch encompassing the whole movie. His relationship with his brother Ramses is compelling andrepresents the emotional gravity of the film. At first linked more than real brothers, they are later thorn apart by respective destinies especially with Ramses unwilling to disappoint the deceased father and be a weak link in the dinasty's chain showing mercy to Hebrow people, a dynamic well established at the beginning of the movie. This showing Moses willing to change for the better and evolve while Ramses unwilling to leave the shadow of his parent.The only valid criticism could be revolving the religious themes of the movie. I agree that there are some twisted elements (e.g. the plagues including the killing of newborn Egyptian babies hinting at a vengeful God). Anyway these elements are faithful to the source material and this story can be enjoyed as pure mythology, a fabulous piece of story-telling for ancient traditions masterfully put together. The movie is not trying to preach or convert so that religious criticism is unvalid in my opinion.This is a masterpiece on all points of view and an highly recommended movie!",The Prince of Egypt

This acknowledgement of the loss that the Egyptians experienced is a really important part of the story, but it was fairly irrelevant in the context of the movie.

130,manalone923,"Excellent, I loved it",10,15 October 2003,"The first thing I'd like to say is that although I won't point fingers, I'm actually quite surprised to see some very harsh undue criticism leveled at this movie. While I'm not saying they should have liked it, I'm surprised to hear how much they apparently DISliked it. The Prince of Egypt is the story of Moses, savior of the Hebrews. If you don't know anything about him, you might wanna try the Bible, as his story begins on, like, page 7 or 8. In all fairness, I'm not a very religious man, but I still found this to be a very enjoyable (I hesitate to use this word...)cartoon. You don't have to be a catholic or jew or very religious to even enjoy it, as it isn't the kind of preachy cartoon you'd expect to see exclusively in bible stores (not that there is anything wrong with that, just not my thing). POE tells a very human story about a man born into a noble family who must decide what to do when he is apparently visited by God and given the great responsibility of rebelling against his adoptive family.While some have complained that this movie is a blemish to the actual biblical story, I believe those people are overreacting. The film is 100 minutes long, and not designed to document every aspect of Moses' very long life. It retells the widely known (and often retold) story of his most widely known accomplishments, and it does so with common cartoon precedents. This does include songs, but no cute talking animal mascots here. Instead, POE does what it suggests it will: In its time frame, it gives us the aspects of Moses' life that most people are familiar with, and it isn't trying to be a lengthy documentary the likes of the Ten Commandments (though I love that film as well). No, POE is just an animated treatment of the tale, and a good one at that. The production values are high, the animation is definitely on par with any other animated (not COMPUTERIZED) film, and in my opinion the songs were actually enjoyable.The film introduces us to Moses and Rameses in a lighthearted way, and it first seems as if this'll be a common kiddy movie. But once Moses is exiled and encounters God, the tone shifts dramatically and we see nothing lighthearted again. The Nile turns to blood and the plagues are shown, including the death of the firstborn. For a cartoon, it takes its subject matter quite seriously (hence the PG rating).How can I change the minds of those who tear this movie apart for its supposed mishandling of the sensitive and beloved subject matter? I don't want to. I'm glad they have their opinions. Still, I do wish they wouldn't take the film so personally or be so judgmental. Compared to any film, let alone cartoon on the subject, POE is one of the most mature and honest in its look at spirituality. And simply being compared to other current cartoons, POE holds its own just fine. In my opinion, the acting, animation, lighting and shadows, and music were excellent.  I honestly left the theater very moved, and I respect the film for being what it is, an animated and good-natured look at how Moses freed the slaves. If at the very least this film brings the story to a new generation of people, Its done its job just fine.",The Prince of Egypt
131,mounirrmaged,My favorite musical of all time,10,15 December 2017,"The 90s were a very interesting and great time for animated films. With hit after hit, becoming classics, even the ones that didn't do well gained more appreciation over time. After all, it was the same year in which the highest 2D animated grossing movie came out, the lion king, and also the birth of CGI animated film with toy story. And, in my opinion, the best American animated film of the era (I say American, because the best was easily princess Mononoke) was the prince of Egypt. This film truly is one of the most beautifully animated movies of all time, combining classical hand drawn art with 3D computer graphics, giving a new life and style to the story. The architectural design and scope is absolutely breathtaking. Speaking of the story, its about, who else? Moses himself. Its a different re-imagining than the epic one by acclaimed director Cecil B Demile, as this film is more family friendly and more Disney-esque. And, believe it or not, this actually is the better movie. It never dumbs down itself to kids, or is too childish to adults, it just has the perfect balance. There is the typical humor that is funny, but there is also an underlying tragedy between all of this, and its done wonderfully and maturely. The best thing about this film is that there is no real villain. Its just a tragic misunderstanding of the characters lost in their paths. Ramses wants to honor his father by being the best pharaoh he can be, while Moses wants to do his job as the prophet of God and save his people. Its a great battle of epic proportions. The characters are done superb in the film. Moses is very much relatable, kind and empathetic. You really feel the weight and responsibility given to him. Ramses is also given good amount of depth. They are both brothers who love each other, but their path lead to a tragic rivalry that neither want to partake in it, adding even more drama that truly gets you invested in it. And its all supported by great voice acting who are all pitch perfect for the role. The side characters are done pretty good as well. And the songs, by god are they amazing. The singing in this film gives me goosebumps every time I hear one of them. Deliver us, when you believe, through the eyes of heaven and of course, the plague. They are all used to further the story, sometimes even visually. I dare to say they are much better than vast majority of the Disney songs. Prince of Egypt truly helped transcending the animation with its story, its artistic style, its writing etc. I adore this movie and can't get enough of it. Truly a work of art",The Prince of Egypt
132,presence,A Visual Masterpiece,9,22 December 1998,"The Prince of Egypt was quite an experience for me.  If you're looking for your typical Disney style animated movies, you'll be extremely disappointed. This movie has a much serious tone, and deals with situations such as death, torture, and plagues.  Unlike Disney movies, there are no talking animals or candlesticks etc...  The humor in this movie resides in each characters jokes and silly actions.  The movie doesn't really have too many catchy melodies like Disney movies, but it makes up for it in the visual department.  The special effects in this movie are unlike anything you've ever seen in an animated flik.  Scenes such as the parting of the Red Sea and the Rain of Fire kept me in awe.  There are many scenes in here that will take your breath away.  The scene that amazed me the most was when you could see the whales swimming in the ocean while the sea was parted. Amazing.  This movie is a must see, and is one of the year's best. 9/10",The Prince of Egypt
133,WeslyM,Spectacular re-telling of the Exodus,9,4 May 1999,"For sheer spectacle, it's tough to beat the Bible.  With ""The Prince of Egypt,"" DreamWorks makes good on its promise to deliver a state-of-the-art animated film that will compete favorably with the best Disney has to offer. As with ""Antz,"" released earlier this year, DreamWorks has successfully resisted the temptation to populate this film with characters that can be turned into further revenue through toy sales.  (I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an ""inspirational"" album, and a ""country"" album--were really necessary.)  The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching ""The Prince of Egypt"" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry.  The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons.  The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder.  One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette.  (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts.  By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.",The Prince of Egypt

The cast is mostly white actors (For those where the race of the voice actor is as important as the character they represent) however that should not turn you away.

136,kylebengel,A good film...,7,2 February 2005,"The Prince of Egypt is a good attempt to bring the story of the Exodus to the screen in a fresh new way. The animation is quite good and many of the songs are enjoyable, if not quite up the level we have come to expect from the Big Dogs over at Disney. But then, this is not a Disney film, so there you go. Despite some rather pedestrian dialog and a few minor plot alterations, this film succeeds well enough to get a favorable review and multiple-viewings. If you are looking for a fun film that has some real heart and some great sequences, this is your movie, despite some reviews here-in that claim the film has done great injustices to the story. In particular, the review contributed by Emma (Angelfalls916) has missed the point of this movie. As with all films, the first desired effect is to entertain. And as entertainment, this movie is great. Sure there are nit-pickers out there who will look for the flaws, but all movies have mistakes. Just ignore them and enjoy the show. But if you are going to pick out the mistakes, then at least get them right. Emma states that she didn't like the scene depicting Ramses being thrown out of the sea. OK, but it is not as though anyone can say what really happened back there, right? Many Christians believe that Ramses died in the Red Sea, yet most historians and biblical scholars believe that the Ramses of the Exodus story is, in fact, Ramses the Second, who's mummy has been touring the world for the past few years, so he couldn't have died in the Red Sea. And for that matter, it wasn't the Red Sea, either. The Hebrews crossed the Reed Sea. And what about the mistaken translation of God's name (Ehyah-Asher-Ehyeh) as ""I am that I am"" when a more correct translation is ""I will be what I will be"". No one is complaining about those mistake. And before you go and blame Disney for making the mistake that have so upset you, Emma, I would like to remind you that this is NOT a Disney picture. As a person of Jewish heritage, I am more than pleased with the result of the film-maker's efforts, despite the film's flaws. I sincerely hope that you can look at this picture and see the entertaining and well-made product and not just a few mistakes.",The Prince of Egypt
137,Apostle,The greatest animated movie EVER!,10,26 August 2000,"It seems that every year and a half or so, Disney brings to the big screen an animated feature film that although is very good, leaves adult audiences trembling in fear that they would have to take their kids to it again and again and again while not being entertained themselves. Not me personally, as I have come to look forward to Disney's latest releases with baited breath. Usually satisfied, (i.e. ""Tarzan"", ""Alladin"", and ""The Lion King"") but sometimes disappointed. (i.e. ""Pocahontis""). But DreamWorks may have finally begun a long journey to maybe knock Disney off as ""King of the Animated Hill"". The Prince of Egypt is just shy historical accuracy and animated perfection. I say this because, well, never mind. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. But as far as the overall product, it was a pure masterpiece. I was particularly impressed by the fact that it was done by an all star cast, yet only one was very recognizable. (Patrick Stewart as Moses' father. But then again, Stewart is steadily rising up to the Sean Connery level of 'most distinguishable voices in a crowd' category.) But overall, the story is about 95% biblically accurate. And if you're like me, you need to give a LITTLE creative license to any historical movie, although the TV version of ""Noah's Ark"" was just this side of blasphemous.Prince Of Egypt- ********** (10 stars out of ten)",The Prince of Egypt

Dreamworks has made a movie, a cartoon admittedly, but this movie couldn't be made if it weren't a cartoon. This way the movie has no borders or boundries.. and the story is exploited to the fullest.The story reminded me a bit of the Lion King, the cartoon by Disney two years earlier .. also it was about a (sort of) king-to-be which goes away to another place, only to return to the hometown sometime later with a lot of vengeance towards a lot of people. This story is straight from the bible, and what book holds more amazing and involving stories as this ancient book. And this movie is all that. Even believing people, who swear by the bible found the movie excellent.'The Prince of Egypt' is a romantic drama, which draws you in and won't let you go... I described this movie as the best movie i saw in '97, maybe it's a little overrated, but that's how i felt walking out of the movie theatre.

If your not a believer it's okay you can still allow yourself to be moved by this film's majesty. This film and The Passion are the two films I rewatch to fill my spirit once a year because it's the only two Hollywood has made appropriately.

140,briggnalle,An invigorating story even if you are not a Christian,9,31 May 2018,"The Prince of Egypt was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and my opinion, one of the top three Dreamworks movies. It tells the story of Moses in it's own beautiful artstyle and storyline depicted of his time before he was called to deliver the Hebrew People from the Egyptians. The music and songs were always intense and I still enjoyed it even when I grew up. The beauty and intense emotion delivered by these 2-D characters brings about a magic that any and all ages can enjoy. As said in the description above, you don't have to be a Christian or religious at all to enjoy this movie. The Prince of Egypt has some of the most powerful artwork and depictions of family and friends including what it means to be an ordinary man who with the help of God can do extraordinary things.
The Prince of Egypt is not a perfect film and like any film telling a biblical story or anything religious at all, it never will be. But it is still an enjoyable experience that I plan to share with my children for years to come and show them just what Dreamworks was capable of back then.",The Prince of Egypt

142,1001,Dreamworks does not equal spiritual works,7,31 December 1998,"The Prince of Egypt is brilliantly animated, but it will be very difficult for Dreamworks to sell a cartoon for adults in an already overcrowded animated movie market. It is a rare animated movie that appeals both to kids and adults, but The Prince of Egypt, by sticking relatively faithfully to the biblical story on which it is based, doesn't even try. It's a movie for adults. No singing camels, no cute furry creatures, no Robin Williams. And Pharaoh thought the plagues were rough.I like and recommend this movie; four scenes in particular stick out in my mind. The opening 8-minute song sequence, a brilliant hieroglyphic montage detailing the Egyptian genocide of Israelite children, the 10 plague sequence, and of course the parting of the Red Sea are all superb. But the movie suffers from the conundrum all biblically based movies do. The Bible is first and foremost a spiritual document; moralizing is its whole point. Film is essentially a visual/ sensual medium. Nary the twain shall meet, Ingmar Bergman movies excepted. So to make The Prince of Egypt entertaining, its makers have emphasized the Moses/Pharoah conflict, turning it into a brotherly and familial battle. No matter its attention to details, this is essentially to miss the point.The movie also drags in the middle because it spends a lot of time with Moses in Midian, where he spent 40 yrs. after killing the Egyptian. The movie spends more time there than the Bible does, so it's unnecessary. Personally, I think the movie should have emphasized the repression and then freedom of the Israelite nation as a whole more, the central conflict revolving around culture and not family. One critic rightly said that this movie, in posterity,  is likely to be admired more than loved.",The Prince of Egypt
143,ma-01629,"7.1? Are you kidding, this is one of the greatest animated movies ever",10,20 January 2021,"A cinematic masterpiece! Prince of Egypt is absoluetly incredible in every way. The animation is absolutely gorgeous and the animators used the advantages of animation perfectly with a movie that shows, not tell, the story through its visuals. The songs are shockingly amazing, not a single bad one, especially the opening, 'The Plagues' and 'When You Believe' and I'm not even a big fan of musicals.The movie can also be quite funny at times and the movie does a great job putting the comedy at the right time so it doesn't disturb any dramatic and emotional moment and this movie is so emotional. Combined with the epic score, amazing voice acting and story, this story just makes me tear up ans the characters are thought out so well with clear motivations and seeing Ramsees and Moses transform from brothers to enemies is heartbreaking and it even hurts the character themselves. It's remarkable!This movie is however kind of fast paced and if you're going as blind like I was into the movie, it doesn't give you enough exposition so it can be confusing at times but in a way, it's a good thing as the movie doesn't waste a single frame. Overall, a masterpiece in every way. A must-see for everybody, no matter your religion. Trust me, it doesn't try to force any beliefs at all. It's just telling a magnificent story. Seriously, it's so good!",The Prince of Egypt

Being a kid at the time I didn't understand the movie. I knew the story of Moses for sure but at that point in my life I didn't really get the magic of animation. Fast-forward today and I see it as movie that needs more attention. The story the characters, and a good blend of computer and traditional animation, it's not easy to keep that consistent. The only downside I can think of is the kookier moments and it is kinda distracting. But other then that it is a really good underrated movie.I hope in the future that they could make more animated films based on Bible stories.",The Prince of Egypt
145,mcshermansmithy,"Epic and Moving, The Prince of Egypt is my favorite animated film.",10,5 May 2014,"The Prince of Egypt was a film that I loved watching over and over as a kid and now that I'm grown up, I'm still blown away by it.I like how this film tells the story of Moses from a different point of view than other stories. It focuses more on the drama and relationship of Moses and Ramses, who don't want to be enemies but Moses wants Ramses to let the Jewish people go, leaving Ramses to choose between family and legacy. The animation is just great, everything feels huge and epic. The songs are fantastic, each one feels right at home with the tone of the film. You have the songwriter of Wicked to thank for that.Surprisingly, people who watch Prince of Egypt think it's made by Disney when in reality it made by Dreamworks. I'm actually glad it wasn't made by Disney, and don't get me wrong, I do love Disney films, but there's always that part of the film that was just made for little kids and laughs that is totally different from the tone of the film. Luckily, the Prince of Egypt is serious and epic, but kids and adults can still watch it. I love this movie so much, I actually think this movie would beat Frozen for Best Animated Movie at the Oscars, but that's my opinion.I definitely recommend Prince of Egypt as a masterpiece. I promise, you won't be disappointed.",The Prince of Egypt
146,movieman-46,Groundbreaking,10,20 December 1998,"I had the pleasure of seeing The Prince of Egypt last weekend, and I was astonished.  I must say that this is the greatest animated movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies period.  I say this not only because of its artistic value, but also because of the impact it makes.  The Prince of Egypt is not a child's silly cartoon; it is the exact opposite.  The Prince of Egypt is a tale of hope, faith, and dread.  The film gets very depressing at times.  Dreamworks has made a movie that will surprise everybody and crush all animation cliches.  Now let's talk about the movie itself.The Prince of Egypt will hook you from the first minute.  The title will appear on the screen in complete silence except for the sound of the wind blowing.  Then the clouds slowly move away to reveal the horror beneath. Slaves.  Thousands of slaves, working on an Egyptian monument.  It then shows troops running through the town and stealing babies from their mothers.  The pharaoh Seti has ordered that all Hebrew first borns be executed.  A mother manages to slip by the troops unnoticed and places her youngest son in a basket.  She sets the basket on the river and it takes the baby to the palace of the pharaoh.  The pharaoh's wife finds the baby and names him Moses. This movie shows the life of Moses.  That is all I'll reveal.The Prince of Egypt is very thematic.  It is intense at times and I don't recommend it to children under 7.  I can't explain this movie without telling you about it, so I'll say this.  Go see the Prince of Egypt, or you will be missing out on one of the best movies of the year.",The Prince of Egypt

148,wiholke2020,"Dream works' best. Yes, I just said that.",8,15 February 2015,"This animated film is PG, but I think anyone around the world should watch this movie.(Spoiler Alert). First of all, let's get one thing straight. This movie is awesome and accurate. If you are a Christian or a Jew, watch this movie or Joseph: King of Dreams. That movie is good too. Don't watch Noah or Exodus: Gods and Kings if you want to see a Biblical accurate story. This movie and Joseph are pretty close to being 100% biblically accurate! There are a few minor things, but I'll tell about those later. Not only is this an animated film, but it's also a musical. And a pretty darn good one, too! I love to listen to the soundtrack, and I listen to it like everyday! Some of the best songs are Deliver Us, Through Heaven's Eyes, Playing With the Big Boys, The Plagues, and Believe. Which is pretty much all the songs but who cares?Now let's talk about the minor changes that aren't what the Bible says. There's only two, but they are important. So, what do you think? When Moses came back, was Pharaoh his Dad or his Brother? The Bible doesn't say, but I'm pretty sure Moses would've said in the Bible that Pharaoh was his brother ( which he is in the movie). But I like this version too! Have you had a big fight with your brother before? None as big as this, ladies and gentlemen. Another minor change is Moses didn't complain as much as much as he did in the Bible when he had to go back to Egypt, and he didn't have to find Aaron at this place so he can speak for him. Nope. Moses speaks for himself. But that's OK, I like this version, too. So there were minor changes to the story, but they're good changes unlike the movie Noah.There's pretty much only one thing I don't necessarily like. I, honestly, think they could've done their animation better. It wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst. Dream Works has a way of doing that with their animation in movies. Movies with not so great animation takes you awhile to get used to. Like you're first like,"" Oh this is a bad animation movie,"" then after awhile it becomes natural. Not with this movie. This movie knew it had bad animation, so they made a thrilling beginning to say, "" This is what we can do with this animation!"" And that's exactly what they did.The casting was great, I loved the cast. I love the music. This is my favorite Dream Works movie. They did a great job with it. Like I said earlier, anyone should watch this movie, even if you're not a Christian! Watch this movie if you haven't and if you did, watch it again because it's just that awesome.8 stars!",The Prince of Egypt

They are slaves no more"". I teared up. What a wonderful story and what a powerful music! Another thing I appreciate about this movie is that the lines between heroes and villains are not so clear. Ramses isn't entirely cruel nor is Moses (or his god) entirely heroic. Especially when it comes to the slaying of all those children. A truly terrific movie. I wish someone could do one as equally good about Esther.",The Prince of Egypt
150,Daniel-10,"Very good, but could be the best",8,18 January 1999,"Sometimes you discover that a movie is not that good but better than you expected, sometimes you go to the movies expecting an unforgettable time and leave the theater with a ""it-was-very-good-but-could-be-better"" feeling. Prince of Egypt fits the last case.It's all there: the visual impact, the fantastic scenes (the one in the Red Sea is no less than wonderful), the emotions attached to a very known story, etc. But this could be the best of all the movies in animation history and it isn't.First of all, this Moses is like a shadow, he should be the soul of the story but feels like he's just passing through it; even his sister Mirian is more expressive than him. The personality of someone who has been chosen by God to free His people and, for that very reason, must throw his past away, could be much better explored.There are too musical scenes too. I know they're different from another scores, as long as they're sometimes close to an opera act, but this shouldn't be an excuse to fill almost the entire plot with them. The one in the very beginning and the last, with the made-to-be hit ""when you believe"", are very fine; but the one with the priests is completely strange to the movie's mood. And, worse, the part that shows the plagues is a waste of good cinematography possibilities: it's all filled with songs and music. It seems like they didn't know how to do the scene and then decided to make a musical out of it. I really don't understand why animated stories must always be entwined with that horrible Broadway style.But don't misunderstand me, you should watch this movie, and in the big screen. Although the plot is filmed mostly with a visual point of view, there are memorable scenes that can make you feel fully delighted and they're worth the price of the ticket.

152,Mister_Anderson,A captivating adaptation of Exodus,9,14 July 2004,"First off, let's make one thing clear.  You don't have to be religious to enjoy ""The Prince of Egypt.""  You don't even need to be familiar with Exodus.  The writers wisely give the story a human element, focusing on the concepts of family, community, purpose, and pride.The animation in this film is fantastic; the emotion of the characters is extremely detailed in their faces and in their bodies.  The camera angles are brilliant and add dramatic effect.Several difficult scenes from the Bible stand out here for their awe and their delicacy, including the ""burning bush"" and the passover sequence.  The other plagues are shown through montage, as they are not the main point of this adaptation.There are only two main characters: Moses and Ramises.  As they grow up, we watch their brotherly bond grow.  Clearly, they are closer to each other than to their father, the Pharaoh.  But when Moses finds out he was ""adopted"" and is really a Hebrew, he starts to question all that surrounds him.  Ultimately, of course, this winds up in Moses demanding Ramises (the new Pharaoh) to let his people (the Hebrew slaves) go.  The result is the conflict of brotherhood and duty/purpose.  Thus, giving Ramises a human element.  He hardens his own heart, rather than God doing it for him.The actors voice the film extremely well.  Overall, the music is decent, but I found the only two standout songs were ""Deliver Us"" (the opening number) and ""When You Believe.""  All the stuff is the middle is passable but unmemorable.  Particularly disappointing is a song about the Egyptian gods, which could have been an eerie spectacle.  Instead, it (and the talents of Martin Short and Steve Martin) are wasted.Finally, I'll just point out that there's a terrific dream sequence including hieroglyphics that is completely original, entrancing, and powerful.  Overall, this movie works well because it takes itself seriously, and it truly ends up delivering the goods.",The Prince of Egypt

The animation was excellent, especially at the water parting, burning bush, and plague scenes.  I almost fell out of my seat the first time that I saw the water being parted.  I have seen it three times now. Everyone else I saw it with thought it was excellent also.  I was moved by a lot of the emotional scenes between the two ""brothers.""

The fantasy of the bible loves to preach hate that pretends to be love. In fact God is all about hate in reality and is in reality evil. To kill children in the name of God? How disgusting and utterly inhumane is that?I read up on the Egyptians some and what the bible teaches vs what actually happened is very contradictory. For one Egypt wasn't built on the backs of Hebrew's it was built through manual labor and slaves yes but very few of the actual slaves were Hebrew. Also the waves going up like it described for moses and his people by god is another lie. In reality it was a natural event and its highly doubtful that Moses people survived it unscathed. Another factor that enraged me is the contemptuous way that the Jewish and Christian people treat faiths other than their own yet they get self righteous when people criticize them right back.

The re-telling of the story of exodus as an animated musical sounds ridiculous but it works so well here. The way in which the story is told is so brilliant that it becomes as visually stunning as it is moving.The animation in this movie is simply breathtaking. It's a perfect blend of CGI and hand drawn animation. It uses these techniques highly to its advantage and creates scenes of incredible scope as well as fluent action and faster paced sequences. This time the story is focused on the relationship between Moses and Ramses being brothers. The journey they both go through from true brothers to mortal enemies is heart breaking. It's also down to the fantastic voice acting from Ralph Fiennes and Val Kilmer that these characters come to life. The supporting cast are also show steelers from Michelle Pfiefer, Patrick Stewart and Jeff Golblum. However without a doubt the best part of this movie is the musical score and songs. Hans Zimmer lends his always astonishing score with a middle eastern backing. The songs featured are fantastic for conveying the emotion and action and condense the story without losing important factors.

166,aadamhgafar-68237,"Prince of Egypt - review, 6/10",6,13 March 2018,"First off, if you didn't already know, the movie is based on the story of Moses from the book of Exodus. This might seem like heavy stuff for an animated movie, but I think it's handled well; the writing ensures darker implications of the story aren't skimped out on to make it more child-friendly but the movie still managed to rein enough in to make it so even young children can access the message in the story. I think there needed to be a little more fleshing out of Moses and his childhood and some downtime with the protagonists to slow down the (in my opinion) very quick pace of the movie and let the movie breathe a bit, but on the whole the story hits all the key points and takes itself seriously (particularly in its dramatic flair), which might be for the best since it proclaims itself as a respectful and accurate recount of the story of Moses.Now in terms of visuals and animation, this movie looks really good even by today's standards. For me it was the greatest achievement of the movie; the movie looked like a mix between beautiful hand-drawn and painterly style with a little bit of CGI thrown in and I have great respect for those who worked on it. If you have a problem with the movie, it will definitely not be the animation because it is really, really outstanding and the attention to detail put into the animation really helps sell the characters and story.Another aspect that the movie shined in was the soundtrack - it was phenomenal. This movie has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a long time, with the fantastic art and animation, the music goes a long way in helping you connect with the characters in the relatively short time they have on-screen.The movie is definitely worth watching, the dramatic story, masterful animation and moving soundtrack all ensure that but the one shortfall that the movie suffers is that far too many things are brushed over; years are skipped over, significant events happen in quick succession before you have time to digest their consequences and there isn't enough quieter moments to disperse the high emotion, energetic scenes. Still... I recommend it, it's a good watch.",The Prince of Egypt

169,libby-75255,Truly a movie for eveyone,10,28 October 2019,"This movie is based on a bible story so obviously it appeals to Christian audiences and is essentially a Christian movie. But this goes far beyond simply telling a bible story. This movie is mind blowing and beautiful in so many ways. It's truly a movie that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and faiths.The characters are wonderful and written deeply. None of them are two dimensional even the antagonist is humanized and his motivations can be understood, no matter how wrong they can be.The songs are amazing and I get them stuck in my head to this day. The song ""Through Heavens Eyes"" is so sweet and uplifting, ""Playing With The Big Boys"" is such a fun villain song, and the famous ""let my people go"" AKA ""The Plagues"" is so bold and moving.The animation is smooth and the colors/atmosphere is great. The animators worked so hard on this and it shows. No shortcuts were taken and as a result we get a visually stunning movie.The darker themes are handled well too. To the point where many small children won't understand HOW dark it can be, the older kids will get it without the movie being overly grotesque, and the adults can fully understand the gravity of the movies conflict.Even the Christian messages and lessons are portrayed in a way where it's easy to reinterpret them if you aren't religious. Messages of ""always have faith"", ""treat others with kindness"" , ""don't forget your roots"" and ""never give up"" are shown throughout the movie in ways that both Christian and non Christian audiences can enjoy.Overall this is an incredible movie with great writing, songs, and animation. If you need a good emotional movie put this on, no matter who's watching with you.",The Prince of Egypt
170,phoenix_100,Prince of Egypt (1998),9,9 January 2011,"The Prince of Egypt is a wonderful movie, with brilliant animation by Dreamworks and a truly memorable set of songs. Its a pity that this brilliant movie only achieves a 6.9 on IMDb whereas other films that are in my opinion, undeserving, got more then a 7 rating. I'm aware that this movie isn't an exact retelling (which may have caused lots of '1' votes) - however all films are slightly changed from their texts.The story is set in Egypt. Moses, a Hebrew, is taken in by the Queen of Egypt - the baby boy grows up into Prince Moses - along side his brother Ramses. Moses however discovers his identity and breaks away from Ramses. After settling down, he is suddenly sent a message from good - to free the Hebrews. Moses does this after a string of misfortunes occur on Egypt. He and the Hebrews escape after the sea parts allowing them to cross it, whereas it crashes upon the Egyptians.Overall, this film is very well done. Dreamworks did a find job animating it, and creating some memorable songs ('Playing with the Big Boys Now', 'I Once Called You Brother'). The movie is fairly paced, and its entertaining and fun to watch. 9/10",The Prince of Egypt
171,tomas38,"A great story, moving scenes, credible characters and fantastic music and storyboard!!",9,10 September 2009,"""The Prince of Egypt"" is a great movie that my daughter also enjoys. The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast. My daughter also has the soundtrack to this. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie. The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. Voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail. The music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz are wonderful. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige. With this movie DreamWorks shows that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience. Great for all ages but mainly adults. Happy watching.",The Prince of Egypt
172,Gracelovesmovies,a moving movie which entertains as well as educates on the bible.,10,8 May 2008,"I have only decided to comment today after rewatching it today and reading the comments on rottentomatoes. Obviously, i am unable to say anything there. And the rating here isn't as high as it should be either...Many comments stated that the movie ""took itself too seriously"" and was probably ""too boring for children"". I watched this movie 10 years ago when i was 7. And it was not boring to me even then.First off, the soundtrack moved me nearly to tears, though i was a child who did not easily. The lyrics and the melodies touched me so much. Perhaps there was not much humour, but the hopeful melodies roused me from my seat. The scriptwriters were careful not to write the speeches of the people as too melodramatic and so inserted important facts such as the plagues in the lyrics of songs and through swift scenes without dialogue.The amazing animation should also be commended. The scenery is beautiful and realistic.Overall, my favourite part is the soundtrack of the movie. The compositions strike a nerve and inspire faith.",The Prince of Egypt
173,Booger-5,POE is DOA,1,20 December 1998,"There is no joy in this picture.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I wish Dreamworks hadn't attempted to do this film by following so strictly the Disney musical formula--only without wit or subtext. They didn't spend enough time letting the audience get to know the main characters before being expected to empathize with them or identify with the struggles they face. This has nothing to do with the AVERAGE running time (of an animated feature)--but the producers unwillingness to commit to creating individual personalites in the leads. So the audience is left to watch a pageant akin to really bad French Grand Opera.  The designs remind me that, like ""Antz,"" Dreamworks eschews appeal by trying too hard NOT to be like Disney. People might not mind or compare if the stories were compelling or at LEAST entertaining (I did NOT say FUNNY, I said entertaining) As far as the color, I wish someone would turn the lights on so we could see the characters.  The skin, clothes, and props are colored so dark and with so little contrast that it strains the eyes.  While I admire the fact that it attempted to do something different--it just didn't work, which proves the idea that a goal is something you strive for, but rarely achieve.  And for all Dreamworks Honking about this being an ""Adult"" picture, it falls into the same trap they suffered with ""Antz"" in trying too hard to alienate anyone that might call them on their bluff:  IT'S A CARTOON.  That's NOT a bad thing!  Disney has had the same problem, and has yet to strike the right balance (Gargoyles in ""Hunchback"")--but the chances Disney's taken in the last few years have been much more satisfying than this production.",The Prince of Egypt
174,Truth,The disclaimer at the beginning does NOT claim the film is accurate!,7,3 January 1999,"The disclaimer at the beginning of the film does not claim the film follows the Exodus story exactly.  I don't get it.  It's a film; it's entertainment. Prince of Egypt was not made to change or replace the story of Moses found in God's Word.  So then why is everyone so upset about it?!  It's a great animated film.  The integration of computer graphics with traditional animation made it look great.  The celebrity voices and beautiful songs made it sound great.  And the way the narrative was developed made it feel great. If you're going to watch it for the purpose of comparing its accuracy to Exodus, then don't watch it.  Otherwise, I recommend it for all to see.",The Prince of Egypt
175,Doc Scot,Impressive version of the story of one of my heroes.,9,29 December 1998,"Although I did cringe at some of the liberties taken with the biblical account, I was impressed with the way the story was told using Dreamworks fanatastic animation.  I was also impressed with the inclusion of the disclaimer at the beginning of the film about the liberties taken and the suggestion to read the actual story in the book of Exodus (reading Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy would also be profitable).  This film and the companion merchandise will cause children and adults to investigate the fascinating story of the Jewish people and their establishment as the first ""Nation under God"". I applaud the filmmakers willpower to resist the temptation to include talking animals (they could make a film on the Book of Judges which includes a talking donkey and not be out of line with a talking animal) which would have severely abused the original history and cheapened the message of the Moses account.  I do criticize the closing song about believing in that it wasn't clear enough that the faith involved was faith in ""I am"" (YHWH) not just some sort of magical self-centered believing which the song seemed to convey. Nevertheless, I hope Dreamworks is successful with this film and look forward to more biblical theme movies from them in the future.",The Prince of Egypt

177,cbarley,Arguably one of the best Biblical films ever,10,8 February 2005,"First, or at least most recognizably, there was The Ten Commandments. The one problem with that film? Although Biblically accurate, it seems to follow too closely to the myth of the Exodus. This leads people to forget that these aren't just historical figures; these were real people with emotions and internal strife. In that, it fails as a story. But where The Ten Commandments fails, The Prince of Egypt succeeds. Prince of Egypt, while on the surface seems little more than another Disney rip-off to those who haven't seen it, is actually much more mature than its look gives. The first, and most important, difference between this film and Heston's film: the role of God and religion. In Ten Commandments, Moses is a harder man, more religiously devout; thus, the film emphasizes the struggle of Moses, the religious figure. Prince of Egypt, however, gives God little more than a bit role. Although still important to the story, He-Who-Is-I-Am is more detached from the rest of the plot than in previous renditions. The reason? Prince of Egypt takes a different turn than the classical view of ""Moses as The Great Prophet,"" and looks more at ""Moses as The Man.""Throughout his whole ordeal, Moses is unsure of himself, even at times loathing of himself for the pain he's caused to both the Hebrews and to the Egyptians. He's, at first, a goof-off, never taking anything, or anyone save for his father, seriously. Later, he's plagued with self-doubt and remorse for what he's done to his Jewish brethren. Even his quest has very little religious undertones - one can see that mostly he does as Jehovah commands in order to reconcile for his past. And through it all, he is tormented that he has to fight his beloved brother, and best friend, in order to set their world right. This story, while perhaps not as religiously powerful as its Heston predecessor, is without a doubt, its spiritual superior. It reminds us that these were real people, with real emotions, dreams, and vices; in doing so, it leaves us with perhaps more respect and understanding of them than any sermon or preachy, Biblically-correct film ever could. A definite must-see for everyone of all ages, especially together.",The Prince of Egypt
178,dastenhero,A 7.1 is far too low for this great of a film.,10,11 April 2021,"""Prince of Egypt"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite animated films of all time, both artistically and emotionally. It is a compelling, mature, respectful, yet invigorating drama for all ages and is one of the few films that I can safely say has made me openly cry for than six times in one sitting. I was recently blessed with the opportunity to see it at my local theater and although I am biased due to the fact that I first viewed this film when I was around seven years old, it not only holds up but is even better when viewed in the theater. If you have the option, of course opt for the theater experience. However, if you're like most people, simply track this film down on Hulu and watch it - it is well worth the hour and a half it takes to experience it.The music ranges from raw and passionate to fun, catchy, and delightful to listen to. It's a film that utilizes both its soundtrack and its musical numbers to serve the story rather than to make it appealing towards kids, and it works perfectly. In fact, part of the reason this film works is that it doesn't only target children as its demographic - it serves as a solid retelling of a beloved yet brutal Bible story that, like the beginning of the movie states, is believed by millions of people across the globe. If the songs are what turn you off on whether to see this movie or not, don't let it - they are some of the best parts of the film and none are cheesy or ""comedic"" like in most Disney film.I'd also like to point out that this is one of the few animated movies to play out in an almost entirely serious manner - while there are a few gags here and there, they are never reoccurring, nor are they distracting from the overall majesty of the film. This is a very grand yet oftentimes disturbing film - while not inappropriate for children, it tells the story of how a man freed an entire race of slaves through the power of God alone. One would think a mainstream animation company would screw this sort of story up by making it funny, but they don't, and that's fantastic - it really makes the scenes feel ""real"" to the viewers and it gives the source material the sense of respect it deserves.All in all, this is a fantastic movie and I'd venture to say that pretty much everyone could benefit from watching it. It has some pretty good lessons to be learned and it's surprisingly educational when it comes to the Bible and the details that people often miss.",The Prince of Egypt
179,Snicker,Move over Charlton Heston - here come the 'toons!,10,22 December 1998,"More than just the story of Moses, ""Prince of Egypt"" is the tale of a voyage of self-discovery, as a man learns that all he is and all he has ever known was based on lies.  Loosely following the Biblical story, the movie follows Moses from the baby pulled from the river, to growing up alongside Rameses, to discovering who, and what, he truly is.  We see Moses challenged again and again in his quest to fulfill a destiny he is only just learning about, and the pain he suffers as he sees what destruction his new God brings down upon his former family.Look beyond the Bible, and see the story behind the story: that man is willing to sacrifice all for the simple right of freedom.",The Prince of Egypt

The relationship between Ramses and Moses is just like a relationship we have with all our brothers. The animation in this movie is amazing. This film is not exactly as good as some other adaptations of the story of Moses, but it proves as one of the best animated films in all of history. The Prince of Egypt has a brilliant score by the composer of The Lion King, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Man of Steel, and Inception: Hans Zimmer.

The telling of the story of Moses is powerfully done and the art is outstanding. It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking. The story has not been 'dumbed down' or watered down. It is accessible to children without alienating other generations and it humanises the characters wonderfully. The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.It's amazing, beautiful wonderful the art, music and sheer intelligence of the story will blow you away.",The Prince of Egypt

186,gchucky,an awesome movie. period.,10,6 May 2000,"this has got to be one of the finest movies in the late '90s. as a Jew, i really enjoyed this movie. and here's why:the plot. this is a great example of poetic license. the movie is very accurate to that which actually happened during the exodus from egypt. at the beginning of the movie, we see the close bond between the two brothers, only to be contradicted by the end of the movie when the two brothers face off. an excellent plot, especially since it is from the bible.the music. i love a good orchestrated cd, and this movie is a shining example of this. just about every song in the movie is wonderful. ""deliver us,"" the seven-minute piece that plays in the beginning of the movie, is a phenomenal piece to open the movie with. its theme leads us through the entire movie until the ending theme, which is a spectacular piece.the animation. using the latest high-tech animation techniques, we see many camera shifts and special effects. one of the greatest special effects is the splitting of the red sea towards the end of the movies. additionally, there is a very cool scene that we see that involves animated hieroglyphics. excellent uses.the actors. this movie has just about the greatest cast. the main voice - moses - is played by the very talented val kilmer, who has an excellent song titled ""the plagues"" with ralph fiennes, who plays ramses. sandra bullock and michelle pfeiffer also give us their voice-overs, among many other people.in my opinion, this is an excellent movie. don't overlook this movie the next time you go to blockbuster or somewhere to rent a movie. it's well worth it.",The Prince of Egypt

188,kevinp8192,Film History's Most Underrated Animated Film,10,18 February 2003,"One of the most moving animated films ever produced.  More a story about the tragic fall of the loving relationship of two brothers than a retelling of the biblical story.  I've read complaints about the story's inaccuracies compared to what's in the Bible, and all I can say is ""so what?""  From the beginning we're told that artistic licenses were taken with the story.  I first saw it two years ago, and after the first viewing, it sent me scrambling for a Bible to read the actual story in Exodus, which I had never read.  Whether you're religious or not, this telling of the story has many powerful messages.I don't mean to make it sound dour or boring.  In addition to the dramatic elements, the film is lively, funny, and technically astonishing. The color palette is extraordinary, there is good use (but not overuse) of CGI, and it has a haunting musical score.  Voice acting is first rate, and it also should be noted that as far as the songs are concerned, there is NO FILLER--all the songs are noteworthy.For those interested, this is also a reference quality DVD as far as video is concerned.  The clarity of the anamorphic widescreen presentation rivals that of Pixar's DVD's, including Monster's Inc. and A Bug's Life, two of my favorites for judging video quality. The audio includes an excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital track which, although not a Dolby Digital EX or DTS ES track like many newer DVDs, is lush throughout and bone rattling when it's supposed to be.  It definitely will show off any HT system.",The Prince of Egypt

This movie has took a lot of time and effort to get all the details right, with just a little added to fill the gaps. There is so many extraordinary events told in this 80 years i'm sure it was hard to choose which ones to focus on.  I personally would have spent more time on the plagues.  I would have like it more if it had brought out Egypt's Gods and shown just who the plagues were directed toward.It did show me a new angle in which I hadn't given much thought.   The fact that Moses had to turn away from the family that raised him and their religion to follow the true God.   Thank you for that other perspective.I liked the movie.

195,Bod-4,The greatest Story Ever Told ???,9,6 January 1999,"The story of exodus from the Biblical angle. This is the future of animated films, this is a real story told through action and the pictures add to that story telling. It is a reflection of how good the film is that it is easy to forget that the film is animated at all and just be caught up in it.Three things leap out from the film to me, firstly the burning bush scene, breathtakingly done, one could palpably feel the effect this scene had on the audience. This was a mere taster on what was to come with the parting of the water. Nothing I have seen of the screen has had such an impact on me.The third point I wish to make is more controversial, and that is about the perspective and portrayal of Egyptian society in the film. Contrasting this film with the Christian Jacq series of books about Rameses is an enlightening experience in terms of image and portrayal. I am no historian of this period but thoughts raised include: Were the Hebrews enslaved or paid well and thought of highly in Egyptian society? Were plagues miraculous or natural phenomona? Finally the indiscriminate killing of first born ( and innocent ) children from a God of love and forgiveness is very hard to reconcile.I feel a more balanced portrayal would have made a film more lasting, but as to that history itself will be the judge.",The Prince of Egypt

The producers kept in mind to balance the emotional content of the movie with fun and humor. The level of moving graphic presentation speaks for itself. The insight is astoundingly considerable in the way graphic realism and cartoon animation is blended.

It seemed that Pharaoh was more sad that Moses left and turned to God rather to him than that his people died. Their relationship was the catalyst to the entire movie and it was their relationship that draws you in and makes you believe in this breathtaking epic.

Where was the awe, the emotion, the wonder, the divine inspiration?The mixture of CGI and traditional animation was as fluid as oil and water. It reminded me of an old Mad Magazine satire that showed Donald Duck cowering naked in a realistically rendered henhouse. The contrast was almost embarrassing. The story either went too slowly or too quickly. I never really made an emotional investment in any of the characters.The story jumped from one ""Money Scene"" to the next ""Money Scene"" with awkward transitions. The distortion of the legend making Moses the Pharaoh's adopted son instead of grandson was not believable. Why would a mother, especially the pharaoh's wife, with a very young son of her own so readily adopt another, and a stranger at that? It was just a plot device to trump up a sibling rivalry, and not a particularly interesting one at that. Moses came off as being too tortured and not heroic or enough. In a movie like this, belief (in the divine) is supposed to make you strong. And God, who is supposedly the point of all Bible stories, was reduced to a cameo role. The character animation was annoyingly angular, with eyes ridiculously far apart and on top of the forehead. And the clanging mixture of flat American (Pfeiffer, Bullock), regal British and traditional Jewish accents was particularly jarring. The songs were pretty much forgettable.  Well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.Katzenberg could say all he wants about how this is a film for adults and he is breaking new ground in animation and making the world safe from Disney mush. But if the movie fails to find an audience, it's not because he aimed too high, but because he missed his mark.",The Prince of Egypt

This animated story of Moses (though minutes into the movie, you almost forget it's animation!) is told in such a unique and refreshing way which adds new life to the Biblical story yet sticks with it well enough to convey the same sense of power and inspiration.  The animation is impeccable and the music (after a few listens/viewings) will stick with you for days on end.  The Burning Bush and parting of the Red Sea scenes alone are worth the price of the movie ticket.

Another thing I think wasn't absolutely true to the Bible, is that the wraith of God only lasted one song. Which leads me into another question: ""Why does it always have to be sing-a-songs in animated movies?"" I think that the movie would've been better if not for the songs.

203,grmann,A miracle movie about miracles!,8,22 October 2000,"The Prince of Egypt swept into the hearts of moviegoers worldwide. It is a timeless story about two brothers who will be separated forever by their different paths. Moses will find out he has to free his people and he will do anything to do it. Rameses will end up losing everything because of his selfish pride. No matter what these two brothers will go through, they will always be brothers at heart.

204,c_rys,Disney would have done it better,7,22 April 2011,"Exodus here gets the Disneyesque treatment, in a star-studded & doubtless expensive effort from Spielberg's DreamWorks studio. The picture works well enough to show a Sunday school or religious studies class learning about Exodus, but considered entirely on its own merits as a film, it doesn't quite work.Structurally, what works for a religious chronicle isn't the same as what works for a film, leaving some sequences stretched out until they become dull, & some (the Ten Plagues most obviously) feeling bizarrely rushed. The writers also seem to assume the viewers know the story already; not knowing it (as my little sister didn't), it is a tad difficult to follow.The songs are dull & unmemorable; the film's musical sequences are its dullest moments, conversely to Disney films, in which they are typically the highlights.It still receives an OK-to-good score of 6/10, though, primarily because the animation is stunning, particularly during the parting of the Red Sea: a whale swims right past the ""wall"" of the sea. I never really thought about what happened to the sea-life in the story, & it's one of many excellent little details of the film. Also, the characters are well-developed, both visually & in terms of their characterisation. Pharoah, in particular, is much more fleshed-out, conflicted, & believable than his almost characterless Biblical counterpart.Finally, a criticism of the source material: my 6-year-old sister was baffled & disturbed when I explained, towards the film's climax, that God was killing the first-born of everyone in Egypt. It may be that this story, featuring as it does slavery, mass infanticide, a river of blood, the drowning of a huge army, & even an implied rape early on, is simply too dark to adequately adapt to a children's animated musical, as was the case with Don Bluth's Disneyesque Anastasia (revolution, regicide, the apparently-unmentionable communism) or Disney's own The Hunchback of Notre Dame (rape as villain motivation).",The Prince of Egypt
205,uppyjc,Another reasonable film from Disney,5,22 December 2004,"Another reasonable film from Disney. I'll be honest - I was extremely bored at the beginning of the school Christmas holidays. I was busy on my computer and my TV was on in the background. So I watched it. I was expecting it to be a bit boring and maybe a little OTT but I was pleasantly surprised by the film. The bible story was followed quite carefully (from what I remember from primary school days!) with a convincing set of characters and some powerful songs and the typical charm you would expect. If you are looking for a film to teach kids about the Moses story, its a good film to see. If you are out for entertainment, I'd look elsewhere. It was a reasonable watch but I wouldn't be looking for it again out of choice.",The Prince of Egypt
206,volpone13,This is What Animation is Supposed to Be!,10,30 November 2004,"I recently saw part of ""The Prince of Egypt"" on television, and it reminded me just what an outstanding film this truly is. Here is a movie that accomplishes everything a great movie is supposed to do, and does it incredibly well without the advantage of having a brand new story. Let's face it... EVERYONE knows the story of Exodus. So how did Dreamworks take one of the most well-known stories of Western civilization (a religious story, at that) and turn it into a hundred minute animated feature?Beautifully.The vocal talents of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michele Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Patrick Stewart, Martin Short, Steve Martin, and Helen Mirrin are some of the finest vocal casting ever done. The performances are incredible. The writing makes the story accessible to everyone. There's plenty of humor to keep things light. There's grandeur on a scale that few movies have ever matched. Yet, in spite of all, the story remains about people. You care about these people before the movie's done, even Rameses the pharaoh.The animation is equal to anything ever done, even though the movie was released six years ago. The special effects used are truly breathtaking in the way they're presented. You would never confuse this movie with any other version that's ever been done.But of all the things that make this movie great, it's the music that turns it into something magical. The musical score is beautifully integrated with the story, expressive and evocative without ever drawing your attention away from the tale unfolding. And the songs are some of the best in any movie. The incredibly beautiful ""When You Believe"", sung by Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky (Sandra Bullock's vocal double) won the Oscar for Best Song. But if you can, get the DVD and listen to the same song presented in multi-language format under Special Features. It's the same song as before, but with each phrase presented in a different language from the international releases of the movie. Words can't describe it. Don't worry about understanding the lyrics... just listen. It's worth the price of the DVD alone. Correction: the two phrases sung by the Japanese vocalists ALONE are worth the price of the DVD. The rest is gravy.",The Prince of Egypt

209,madisonlboehm,"an amazing movie with a message of faith, hope and inspiration for all ages and all believers",10,28 May 2018,"A common complaint I see is how many differences there are between this movie and the story in the bible. While I do not refute this, I don't think these differences should be held against the film. I was 6 when The Prince of Egypt came out and I remember watching it with my family. This movie has become a pillar in my faith. A source of faith when I am lacking and a dose of hope when I feel none. Game of Thrones is a tv series based on a book. As graphic as it is, it is nothing compared to the violence in the books. If Game of Thrones were made into a tv series, many things would have to be left out or altered. Still, it is an amazing, highly ranked series. My point on being tangent here, is that if you discredit this film because it is different from the bible, you are missing out on a great film. The movie is adapted for children but still conveys an unfathomable message of faith and hope even when there seems to be none. If you are looking for a more realistic version of the story, watch The Ten Commandments. But I will leave you with this; this movie came out when I was six. I am now twenty five and as a (potentially biased) Christian, I have watched this movie countless times and I never tire of its message and feeling of hope, faith and inspiration.",The Prince of Egypt
210,CLPyle,A Beautiful and Moving Depiction of Moses,9,15 April 2000,"Adapting the story of Moses seemed a risky venture for Dreamworks to use as its foray into the lucrative family animation market dominated by the Mouseketeers.  Dealing with a religious icon, especially in a film intended for children, is bound to offend lots of people.  (By contrast, 20th Century Fox made a much safer bet by doing ""Anastasia."")The resulting work, however, is beautiful.  It treats its subject with the due respect and resists the urge to sugarcoat the politically incorrect elements of the biblical story.  ""The Prince of Egypt"" does make changes in the story for dramatic purposes, as is stated in a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie.  (The disclaimer gently advises interested viewers to seek the biblical Moses in the Bible.)The movie focuses on Moses transformation from a Prince of Egypt to the leader of an enslaved people.  Moses' mother sets the infant Moses adrift in a basket to save him from the slaughter of Hebrew children ordered by the Egyptian pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart).  Ironically the foundling is adopted by the pharaoh's wife (Helen Mirren) and raised as a prince.  Moses is close to his older brother Rameses (Ralph Fiennes), the heir to the throne.  They are a rumbunctious pair constantly in mischief; when we meet them they are engaged in a chariot race that floods a temple with sand. 
Prince Moses (Val Kilmer) is spoiled but basically a decent guy. When he is given a slave woman (Michelle Pfeiffer), Moses allows her to escape.  He also follows her and runs into his real siblings (Sandra Bullock and Jeff Goldblum), who reveal the truth about his heritage and the horrible crimes of his adoptive father.  The revelation propels Moses into a moral crisis that will lead him to murder and a flight into the desert.  There he receives a message from God and returns to Egypt to free the slaves.""The Prince of Egypt"" has many elements of the Disney model. It's a coming of age story about a misfit having an identity crisis. It teaches the power of positive thinking (specifically, that your life may seem meaningless to you but it has great significance from a divine perspective).  It is a musical and includes comic relief.  Those last elements seemed forced to me. I've never been a fan of musicals (animated or otherwise) and could have done without characters bursting into song.  And, while some comic elements (like the chariot race) are important for character development, others (like the high priests voiced by Steve Martin and Martin Short) seem inappropriate.Regardless of those flaws, though, ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a magnificent spectacle.  Egypt's palace is gigantic sprawl of monuments.  The miracles of God, particularly the parting of the Red Sea, are beautifully done.A word of caution:  some of the actions of God may raise troubling questions for children, especially His slaughter of the first-born sons of Egypt.  But I think ""The Prince of Egypt"" deserves applause for having the guts to raise those questions.",The Prince of Egypt
211,Brian-75,American Animation Comes of Age.,9,20 December 1998,"The first thing I would like to point out is that the Title of this Film is ""The Prince of Egypt"", NOT the ""Ten Commandments."" or ""Exodus.""I say this because I hear a lot of criticism claiming  that Dreamworks skips over Moses' descent from Mt. Sinai, the Golden Calf, and his 40 years in the desert etc....  I don't think Dreamworks wanted to tell that part of the story with this movie.  I consider the heart of the movie to be about the love between  Moses and Ramses.  I have also read criticism that the film centers more on their relationship than it does on that of Moses and Aaron, his real brother.  If you ask me, there is more to tell about two brothers who spend their whole life together and end up bitter, albeit unfortunate, enemies.  Aaron, while bound by blood, is unemotionally attached when they meet.  I found it impossible to hate Ramses, and applaud Dreamworks for making him a person, not a stereotype.That said... I loved this movie.  I will be VERY disappointed if it does not do well at the box office.  Dreamworks is taking a big risk with this movie, which will hopefully set the precedent for every animation to follow. Disney beware!  Or take notes.One of the previous comments states that Dreamworks takes no risks in ""Prince""...  I can't believe someone thinks that...  With all the crap that Disney has thrown at us lately, who can not be impressed with what Katzenberg has done?  I can cite many examples, but one will do.  Disney would have NEVER attempted the scene where Ramses son dies, and the audience sees his lifeless arm fall through the open door... let alone the next scene where Ramses drops the  cloth over the boy.  The sight of a very young corpse (and it is painfully obvious that there IS a corpse under the cloth) is very effective.  Ok, I'll mention another, but only because this second one is so very obvious.  What about the Risk of making an animated film about one of the most important stories in the Bible, knowing all the while that you could offend scores of people's religious faith?I would also like to say that the animation impressed me more than either of the ""insect features"" that came out shortly before this movie.  True, they are completely different styles,  (and very wondeful) but nothing in either of the previous blew me away quite like the parting of the red sea... or many other wonderful examples throughout ""Prince"".I need not review the Story, but I would like to say that the person above who calls the plot lame.. or something like that... just is not thinking. That's a lot like saying the plot of Les Miserables was lame.  Sure, the movie COULD have been lame, but the plot has already proven itself to be a classic.  As it is, I don't think the movie was bad.  In fact, I've never been this excited about animation before in my life... This coming from an animation major in college.  I don't think I can say enough in praise of Dreamworks efforts, so I'll let it go at that.",The Prince of Egypt
212,silmawen,Not bad,7,3 November 1999,"Some animated features seem to turn good actors into over-actors.  I suppose it has to do with them assuming since we can't see -their- faces, they need to put extra emotion into their voices.  Prince of Egypt is not one of these animated features.There was one tiny thing that kept throwing me out of the movie.  I kept thinking, 'Why are Rameses and Seti British?'.  I love both Patrick Stewart and Ralph Fiennes, but it seemed odd.  Mostly it was Seti that I was thrown out by.  Ralph Fiennes' accent wasn't as strong as Stewarts.Some of the music was really annoying and I was worried during the first 10 minutes that it might be nothing but music.  I thought the animation was well done.  I was most impressed by a scene near the end where Rameses was shouting 'Moses'.",The Prince of Egypt

The beginning is a little slow, and some of the singing feels out of place, but I only see the need to bump down one star.

She hopes and prays that the baby will be safe and fortunately, the basket it found by the pharaoh¡¯s daughter, the princess. She takes the baby in, naming him Moses. Moses grows up in the palace, with his younger brother. He is always getting into trouble and seems as if he doesn't quite fit in well among the other Egyptians.

He finds out that he is actually an Israelite and he leaves after being convicted as a murderer. He moves far away, marries Zipporah, and has children. Moses works as a herdsman but is called on by God. He eventually obeys, going to Egypt ordering his ¡°brother¡± who is now pharaoh, ¡°Let my people go.¡± The 10 plagues follow, and it was amusing to see the pharaoh¡¯s magicians attempting to perform the same miracles that Moses does.

If you want a perfectly accurate Biblical story, don't look at this.  I think this movie put more of an emphasis on certain aspects that can be involved in religion (mostly how holding on to your beliefs is rewarding), but less of actual theology. Which worked perfectly for me.The animation is wonderful.  At times I forget that we aren't watching real people.  The music is lovely...""When You Believe"" nearly brought me to tears.  The movie never made fun of itself, and the result is that every scene seemed to have power and a purpose.  I loved the characters themselves, but their relationships were especially interesting (mostly the kind of love/hate thing going on with Moses and Rameses).  I'm sure the wonderful voice casting is mostly responsible for this.This is the most emotion-provoking animated film I've ever seen.  I can't describe the sense of peace, joy, and awe it gave me.  And if you really are in it for the religious aspect, hey, it's a great way to make the kids was to find the story in the Bible.

And even Simon Wells returns from Amblimation to direct this extravagance well-prepared from DreamWorks, brilliant as the history of the Bible, served with historical precision! No sugar included! DreamWorks is still a super-animation massive god studio. I think they look much better traditionally animated.

Its visuals simply can't be described, for its images will stay in your mind forever.  They will not be seared, like the brutal images of Saving Private Ryan, but instead, simply stay with you.  When you remember them, you will smile, for they are the true meaning of epic.If you don't like the film's story, or even if you don't like the film in general, you will still stare in awe at its visual images.

223,leighton,Reduces an epic story to epic visuals. Disappointing.,6,8 January 1999,"The Prince of Egypt uses the story of Moses as written in Exodus to serve as an epic backdrop. Sadly, it is used as the backdrop for a very mundane tale about a young man who doesn't quite fit in with his 'family' and rediscovers his roots. Leaving aside the impressive visual spectacle this is a film that has little more to say than the sitcom 'Different Strokes', and much less to say than Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing', about social circumstances and justice. And it virtually ignores religion - presumably for the sake of Middle East sales...It must be said, though, that the vocal cast do a creditable job with a particularly polite, unconvincing and unsurprising script.It is arguable that animation works best to represent events that cannot be reproduced naturally. Disney's doe-eyed characters work well because they are obviously unreal and can portray a range of distorted expressions to communicate mood. This film's more realistic human-like portrayals unfortunately limit the expressive range of the characters, so for some of the more intimate scenes (such as Moses' first adult encounter with Miriam) the viewer is left staring at an unmoving cartoon human head with little or no nuance of emotion. Such stories are best told with live actors, especially when the music is little help.The film is, to be sure, mighty impressive when it works. Barring one or two shortcuts the art direction is excellent. Key scenes such as the hieroglyphic dream sequence, the parting of the Red Sea and the death of the firstborn are handled as well as anyone could hope to expect, and the crew deserve merit for these great achievements. Strangely though, they have chosen to take glaring computer animation shortcuts in odd places and the clash of computer precision with cell animation fuzziness is sometimes painful (as it is in recent Disney products).Unfortunately, the well-placed symbolism and visual opulence have to provide nearly all the entertainment because, with the exception of the Court Priest's song-and-dance routine, the music is tedious and the lyrics banal.The Prince of Egypt is, I think, worth watching for its merits - which are entirely visual.

The animation is astonishing and the characterisations are great. I will not add further mention of how inappropriate 'You're Playing with the Big Boys' song is. Dreamworks must now set a different path from that of Disney. To avoid the inevitable comparisons, Dreamworks should continue with the idea to produce animated motion pictures equally for the adult because there IS an audience for such a genre. Additionally, I don't know why no one has picked up on this before, but songs in cartoons suck. With the exception of the River Lullaby and When You Believe (Pfeiffer/Dworsky), there is no need for the others. This is the same for all of Disney's animations. On each of Disney's films, who can really remember any of the songs besides the main piece? The lesser the amount of ridiculous songs the better the animation. All kids really want to see is the animation and action - not the silly songs. Disney discredits kids too much - kids are much smarter these days. The Prince of Egypt is wonderfully told and the actual line drawing is marvellous. It is great to know that Fiennes and Pfeiffer sang their parts. If movie studios are going to get celebrities to be the voices of characters and are still willing to persist with silly songs - the least they could do is make the actual actors sing the songs - or alternatively let the singers SPEAK the parts.",The Prince of Egypt

The naturalistic art style of the Egyptian ""Amarna"" period (the reign of Akhenaten) seems to have been a major influence.Val Kilmer as Moses is sort of meh, and of course the Evil Egyptians all have to have very theatrical British accents to contrast with the Good Israelites, who speak with a TV ""Middle American"" American accent.I'm sure the biblical experts will quibble with a lot of the liberties taken with the story.

If you see this historical movie, you'd might feel how hard and horrible it was back then. If Moses didn't help, we would be working in slavery by now. So, watch this historic, sad, adventurous movie. It will fill your heart if you understand what is happening then like 2,000 years ago. OK good bye.",The Prince of Egypt

This is one of the worst movies of any kind I have ever seen, and certainly the worst animated movie ever made. To compare it to any Disney work is a cruel joke. There are no interesting or captivating scenes, dull drawings and coloring, zero magic or sparkle, little humor and that poorly done. Even the death mist is unimaginative.

Emphasizes the message rather than the prophet.,10,21 December 1998,"My kids and I, (ages 5, 3 and 35) truly enjoyed this mixture of computer animation, cartoon and biblical history. My daughter (5) thought it had beautiful scenery and was able to follow the story line easily. My son (3) loved the music and the effects, especially the ""smoke/fire-like"" representation of God.We took the time to retell the story to our children over the course of the previous two weeks prior to seeing the movie. The hardest thing to explain was to explain what elevated a ""plague"" to being a terribly awesome event.We thoroughly enjoyed it! You truly feel the love that Ramses and Moses had for each other as brothers that breaks down into following what your belief system.Cheers to Dreamworks SKG for having the courage to deliver such a profound telling of a biblical saga in balanced manner.",The Prince of Egypt
238,Klaatu-8,A great family film!,9,20 December 1998,"A great story of the book of Exodus in the Bible. Val Kilmer as usual does a great job of the voice of Moses. The songs are typical Disney fare.

Charlton Heston would have been great as the voice of GOD!",The Prince of Egypt

240,Disappearer74,Spolit by singing,6,14 December 1998,"Dreamworks takes on Disney at its own game but fails to make the definitive statement in animation. They follow the formula too closely complete with an overabundance of inappropriate songs. Just when you feel yourself being drawn in, the spell is broken by one of the characters bursting into song. This is the story of Moses - how are we supposed to take it seriously? Where is it written that all animated features must be movies? The subject didn't warrant it, it's hardly a kids film, so why?A huge disappointment.",The Prince of Egypt
241,noone-6,It was a nice try,6,28 December 1998,"Dreamworks had a lot of money and expectations sunk into this film that could have been the years best, but I am afraid that it fell way short.  The superb cast of the film drew me to see it originally and after all the rave reviews I started getting excited.  The movie failed to deliver for me. POE could have been fantastic had it not been for the songs that interrupted the flow of the plot.  They seemed out of place, almost forced. In fact, the audience that I saw the picture with began sighing when the music started playing.  POE had all the elements to make it a great film. Dreamworks should have forgotten about their competition (Disney) and should have just produced a good film. Overall: a family film, take the kids to see it to get out of the house; but don't worry about missing it.",The Prince of Egypt
242,Faunus,You'll laugh...you'll cry...you'll wish Disney had done it!!!,7,20 December 1998,"All year long, we've heard how fantastic the animation and music in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT (the second animated film from the fledgling DreamWorks company in one year) would be.  How unlike anything else we had ever seen it would be.  How...well, you get the picture.It started out wonderfully.  (I believe the name of the song is ""Deliver Us"")  Ofra Haza, who provided the interesting Egyptian background to ""Pump Up the Volume"" by one-hit-wonder Marrs over a decade ago) was moving as Yocheved, mother of the infant Moses.  And the animation was immense, sprawling, fabulous!!!But just past the chariot race (the film's second big animation scene) it started losing a lot of what the opening sequence had promised us.  Facial features on the adult Rameses looked more like cheap television animation than state of the art computerized animation.  The music was...well, boring. And I'm sorry but Tzipporrah looked a little too much like Disney's Pocahontas for my comfort--in fact, her entire outfit looked more Native American than it did Midian.This is not to say there were not moments that took my breath.  The parting (and crossing) of The Red Sea was amazing.  And the animation and song during which the hand of God smote the Egyptian empire (er...the plagues, that is) was nothing short of flawless.See this movie, yes.  But remember, Disney's done animation longer and better, and unless Dreamworks comes a long way soon, Disney will continue to dominate.  And also, make sure you read the real story of Exodus and don't take Hollywood's word for it.",The Prince of Egypt
243,Gerard-8,Excellent animation and computer graphics,8,21 December 1998,"This first animated feature by Dreamworks is a drama of biblical proportions. The animation and computer graphics, cinematography, score and songs, and all-star cast combine to form an excellent film.Watch for the sequence where Moses is having a nightmare, in which all the characters are in hieroglyphic form, running around on the stone walls. This masterfully-executed scene itself should put ""Prince of Egypt"" in the history books--not to mention the angel-of-death and crossing-the-red-sea sequences.Kudos to all who worked on this beautiful, stirring, Oscar worthy film. The big mouse has indeed met his match.",The Prince of Egypt
244,Ahmad-4,"Great potential, but not quite there",4,23 December 1998,"After seeing a trailer for this film, and part of the making for the film, I had high expectations. I was even prepared to finally admit that a non-Disney studio could produce a work that could compare itself to a Disney great.Frankly, I was disappointed. I found the movie slow in parts, and the songs were mainly boring. I found the voice talents worked extremely poorly, and it took me a while to become accustomed to the wide range of accents which the characters assumed, and which did not quite fit together. Perhaps other studios need to take a look at how Disney casts voice talents - ie. cast actors for the TALENTS in the role, rather than the mere fact that they are Hollywood stars.The worst element of the film to me was the inclusion of the two magicians of the King. They were completely out of place, and during their musical number, their repetition of the phase ""You're playing with the big boys now"" annoyed me almost to the extent that I wanted to walk out of the film.Aside from all the bad, some of the effects (esp. parting of the sea) are visually spectacular. But aside from these effects, this film offers little else.",The Prince of Egypt
245,Malcolm-10,Wonderfully put together,8,8 January 1999,"I enjoyed this movie immensely, except for the songs.  The story of Moses is timeless and would flow a lot better if not for cheesy tunes breaking up the action.  The songs were not well done and seemed forced, as if DreamWorks felt they had to follow the animation model that Disney has perfected.  This movie could have stood on its own two feet as a regular movie that happen to be animated.  The animation in this movie made it possible to depict scenes that just would not have been as powerful in the traditional live-action genre.  Take out the songs, and DreamWorks would have had a classic. Coupled with Saving Private Ryan though, this puts Spielberg and pals on the map.",The Prince of Egypt
246,Engine-2,Wannabe adult Disney fails badly...,4,8 January 1999,"A massively over-hyped piece of faux-adult entertainment. The scripting ranges from awkward, to laughably inept. The songs, in addition to being totally out of place, are completely forgettable. The acting is wretched for the main part, with a stand-out performance by Patrick Stewart. The animation is generally quite good, but lacks the vivacity of a Disney production, which the film is obviously trying to compete with. The computer animated parts are very effective, but are integrated very poorly with the cel animation, especially in the Red Sea sequence. Backgrounds are extremely patchy. But, for the most part, the movie is guilty of the worst cinematic crime of all; of being very, very boring. The entire film contains two compelling scenes: The taking of the first born, and the crossing of the Red Sea. These two scenes possess the grandeur necessary of such a powerful story, but elsewhere, the movie is very wanting. Very disappointing.",The Prince of Egypt
247,Pepijn-2,Unbelievable religious dogmatism without an ounce of relativation,1,9 January 1999,"I would have quite enjoyed this movie, as it's very well executed, with the fantastic storyline that animated movies of this kind should have, if the creators of the movie hadn't put that ridiculously pretentious text at the beginning of it, telling me that I had to believe that all of this actually happened!It's scary to me that not only do these people apparently believe that God murdered tens of thousands of innocent people so that the hebrews could go free (to name just one of the incredibly cruel and vengeful acts that seem so incredibly human), but they also don't appear to see any problem with that!A scene with hebrews singing triumphantly in the streets follows directly a scene in which an innocent child is struck dead, and the movie is full of moments like these.

It's a tale of humanity and identity; the fact it's one of the bases for world religion is secondary.  The telling of the Exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt, through animation, makes the story accessible to all ages.  Brilliant animation, a talented voice cast, and a well-written adaptation of the scriptures make it a genuinely profound movie.  I make a point to watch it if it's on, for the animation, the music, even the story...",The Prince of Egypt
250,thecodingbiologist,A Masterpiece in Animation,10,30 June 2019,"Regardless of religious standing, this movie deserves far more credit than people have given it. It has no right to be as good as it is. The characters are fleshed out and well-written, making even the Pharaoh Ramses a relatable character. The music, done by Hans Zimmer, makes you feel small in the presence of the grand Egyptian monuments and supernatural miracles. The animation is outstanding in almost every way, up there with the best animated works. Its themes and messages are geared towards a wide variety of age groups, balancing light-hearted and mature themes. I definitely recommend watching on a streaming service, or better yet, buying a physical copy so that you can experience this film at its best.",The Prince of Egypt

This is such a powerful story that so many Jews, Christians and Muslims are very lucky to believe in. The Prince of Egypt is very dramatic, emotional and very faithful to the Book of Exodus. The music sounds like a Webster/Rice piece, and when When You Believe came on, it was so beautiful it nearly made me cry.",The Prince of Egypt
253,operasam@hotmail.com,The secularists will try and fail to bury this movie,10,23 September 2019,"Since The Prince of Egypt was first released in 1998, it has received very little attention from the lists of great animated films. Despite the incredible songs by Stephen Schwartz, the fascinating and relatable characters, the timeless story, and the overall magnitude of the film despite its short running time, it almost seems as though there are many who want to see this movie forgotten. But why? Why should such an inspired piece of art be met with such hostility? The simple answer is hostility toward religion. Or to be more exact, cultural Marxism.No matter what any ""authoritative"" critic may try to claim, The Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of all time and will almost certainly rise from the ashes to be recognized as such forever. Anyone with an open mind can watch this movie and see within the first scene how powerful this film really is. Those who are hostile toward Christianity, Judaism, or religion in general, however, may complain that the film is off-putting to non-believers, which film-aficionados often are. To answer this, yes, it does appear to be a film made by believers. But does this really diminish everything that makes it so powerful as a piece of cinema, to the point that it should be forgotten? Few animated movie musicals have ever achieved such a powerful, lasting effect as The Prince of Egypt, and there is no good reason why this movie should not top every list of great animated films, as well as movie musicals. Even such beloved Disney classics as The Lion King, Beauty & the Beast, and Aladdin could arguably be eclipsed in some ways by this film.Perhaps the most powerful part of the movie is the music. Stephen Schwartz, the composer and lyricist of Wicked, Godspell, and Pippin, as well as the lyricist for Disney's Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, delivers some of his best work in The Prince of Egypt. Although all his music is thrilling, this seems to have been a very personal and important project to Mr. Schwartz. The film was just recently re-adapted into a stage musical, so the songs will now have a much better chance of achieving immortality. Schwartz's gift for using music to tell stories rivals that of such greats as Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and Sondheim, and he more than deserves to be counted among them. His work on this film only assures that. Furthermore, Hans Zimmer's score is just as great as his work in Lion King or anything else he's done.Those who hate religion and Christianity will continue to ridicule and try to diminish this film, but they will never be able to change the fact that true, genuine inspiration was behind its creation. The Exodus is one of the most spiritual and inspiring stories in all of human history, and Dreamworks has captured it here beautifully in the form of an animated movie musical. The hostility received by The Prince of Egypt may actually be an indication of how exceptional it truly is; a truly world-changing work of art is likely to have its detractors, and this is a film whose nay-sayers are definitely not destined to prevail. For those who do believe in God or who are simply open to the idea of a good movie with a Biblical story as its source material, The Prince of Egypt is sure to be a spiritual experience to carry within one's heart forever. It is a spectacular movie, and despite the resistance from the secular left that seeks to destroy everything about the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is too inspired a work of art to be lost to obscurity.",The Prince of Egypt

This is the worst Dreamworks movie ever made. That is the only reason to watch it. So that you can say you have seen the very worst. It has the darkest, most depressing characters and story, and the most adult themes of any Dreamworks movie, including murder, torture, and rape. What were they thinking? Did they forget that these movies are supposed to be for children? And it is painfully inaccurate, historically, including many debunked myths about Egyptian culture and the building of the pyramids.

255,Realiser,Kill the children,4,18 January 2017,"The original bible story was quite brutal in my opinion, and I would normally not show it to kids. Oh my goodness, this installment didn't disappoint. Brutal genocidal god, portrayed as kind and generous, kills thousands of innocent children and everyone cheers. It could have been a story about abolishing slavery, it wasn't, just like in the bible. Instead only Jew slaves are saved, no mention for relieving burden for anyone else. Great, let's celebrate the death of kids. My primary reservations with the story were that an all powerful God kills thousand of innocent children, and we are supposed to cheer. Even if you want to punish slave owners, do that (like Daenerys), don't kill their children. But the got goes beyond that, not only do slavers' kids die, but also everyone else's. Only a tiny fraction of Egyptian society owned slaves, most slaves were owned by ""government"" (read Pharaoh). >99% were regular people workers, farmers and so on. Also we shouldn't forget that most slaves were probably not Jewish, rather from other religions. Non-Jewish slaves suffer pretty bad, they'd think it couldn't get any worse. Then surprise: all your children are dead.",The Prince of Egypt
256,dwr890,Can't believe the rating on here is so low,10,21 July 2012,"Prince of Egypt is one of the greatest animated films of all time, regardless of what anyone says. A lot of people dogged Dreamworks during and 90's and still due because they're trying to ""compete"" with Disney. First of all they don't have to compete, because Dreamworks is definitely in the same league and this movie proves it. The music of the movie is amazing and it's what I love best about it. ""Deliver Us"" is such a dramatic and poised piece of music, just hearing it play as you watch the Hebrew slaves struggle, and then there is Yocheved (I think that's her name) when she sings ""River Oh River"". I love Ofra Haza as Yocheved, her voice is so beautiful and natural. Next song I love is what people seem to recognize the most is ""When You Believe"", it is a divine hymn of faith saying that even if all goes wrong, if you remain faithful, God will show mercy. The movie version which is sung by Miriam (Sally Dworsky) and Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) is pretty good, I especially like the break in the middle where the children sing ""Ashi Ra""; but to be honest I liked the cover sung by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston more. Maybe it's because of my African American roots that prefer the gospel version instead. With that being said, the movie is full of beautiful scores but these are my favorites. The art and animation in this movie is absolutely top notch. I think it's the only film to do what it's done during time it was created. What makes ""Prince of Egypt"" so unique is that it blended traditional drawing and painting with digital CGI. Keep in mind that this was during the 90's so digital animation was still in experimentation, and what's surprising is how good the animation looks. It doesn't look like a blocky, pixelated mess that you would find during this era,everything looks so smooth,vivid and rich.A few notable things to point out are The Burning Bush, The Red Sea,The Plagues,the Angel of Death and the parting of the Red Sea.These are the BEST scenes in the entire movie, all digital! Last but not least , the story! Last year I watched an episode of Nostalgia Critic's Old vs. New where he decided which of the two movies, The Ten Commandments and Th e Prince of Egypt,was better. He ultimately chose The Prince of Egypt, and the thing that gave P.O.E. it's edge is the amazing storyline. The decision of the writers to make Moses and Ramses brothers instead of sworn enemies was a great move. It gives way more drama and emotion to the story because Moses goes through a constant internal struggle, whether or not to go against the brother he loves, to stay truthful to his god and his people or to continue living the life of comfort with the only family he's known and deny what he truly is. All in all this is a superb animated film for people of all ages, truly something of a masterpiece and I feel that everybody should at least watch this once if not hundreds of times (it's that good).",The Prince of Egypt

Listening ""There can be miracles/When You Believe"" didn't feel quite right after seeing God killing city full of Egyptian families and children just cause their race.

I cannot even begin to count how many symbols, analogies, allegorical and anagogical references. The use of intertexts in the scene where the hieroglyphs reveal to Moses about how his mother managed to avoid the Pharaoh's army must have been the most artistically-crafted scene in animated film history.Not even to mention how accurate the story was with the Bible while keeping the story engaging. Many depictions of Bible stories tend to branch off of the original story to maintain the audience's attention, which can be very stressful for a person who has had the Bible a part of their entire childhood. This movie is a very good attempt at permeating the membrane of the highly secular millennial generation.

The animation -- stunning, spectacular, any other really good adjectives you can think of.  It is possibly the most visually beautiful movie in ages.  The voice actors are excellent, particularly Ralph Fiennes as Ramses.  The one flaw is the half-hearted attempt at mainstreaming that is ""You're Playing With the Big Boys Now,"" a rather embarrassing and stupid song that disturbs the overall feel of the movie, but only briefly.  Beyond that, the songs are always beautiful if not memorable; they function more as atmosphere-inducing background music than as show-stopping numbers.

There were workers whom the Egyptians paid. Should there be no workers? There are still millions. I would prefer to watch a more objective, less Jewish, less musical, more serious film.

The charactarization of Zipporah, based on Michelle Pfeiffer, was especailly vivid.  Patrick Stewart Helen Mirren, Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Sandra Bullock were all beautifully cast.The movie tells the story of the life and spiritual awakening of Moses and how he led the Israelites out of Egypt and into the Exodus.  There was a bit of glossing over of history as there would need to have been if we were to ever have left the theatre, but the story as presented was very, very inspiring, non-denominational and clear in the telling.The music was a big hit with the under 30 crowd too, many of whom stayed until the last note was sounded.  I recognized Boyz II Men, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Babyface and many others.  My only regret was that the plagues were a bit rushed and there was no whirlwind of clouds by day or fire by night as I had always pictured in my imagination.

There were lots of songs by well known R&B Artists (Mariah Carey, Boys II Men, Whitney Houston etc.) The visuals were really beautiful, detailed and flowing -  the story was very very inspiring - the film opens with a note that it is based on the story of Moses to be found in the book of Exodus in the Bible and that many people of many faiths of the world are inspired by the story of Moses' life and faith.  The movie does not show evey single detail of Moses' life but the heart of the story is there.  Val Kilmer's Moses the rebel and Ralph Feinnes' Rameses the young pharoah were perfectly cast; I thought the artwork on Zipporah, Moses' wife was beautifully realized as a portrait of Michelle Pfeiffer, as was Sandra Bullock as Miriam, Moses' sister -- kudos to Dreamworks SKG.

The movie seemed more interested in its own ability to sell than it was in the actual story.  What we were treated to was animated cliff notes, and not very thorough ones at that.  It was a summary of only a portion of the story of Moses.  Major details were left out like God telling Moses how to use his staff.  What about Aaron?  Aaron was Moses' sidekick.  Moses never faced the Pharaoh alone, Aaron was his mouthpiece.  (Which was another issue the movie failed to confront).  What about the constant grumbling and complaining of the Jewish people that began even before they were led out of Egypt?The ending of the movie was so sudden that I turned and asked my wife, ""is this it?""

I found out that this movie is based on the bible when i proceeded to explain the plot to my mom, she then began to tell me what happened next, i was like ""mom how did you know that?""  well she told me it was from the bible, i was surprised but i felt kind of good inside..  anyway instead of telling you about me, let's go to the movie.. It was very coherent, the music interlaced seamlessly with the movie, and the animation truly is the pinnacle, better than any other hand drawn movie. the look is very modern,  the characterization shows many sides of their personality, unlike titanic which had a few flat characters.  And the message is evident and clear,,,the movie is intriguing and interesting, you forget you know that it is a cartoon and if you read the bible, that you know what will happen (again like titanic)  this illustrates that this will have box office GOLD, now i have a flaw to discuss but it is invalid, because it describes that some voices are anachronistic but then again, ""do we want them talking egyptian and hebrew?""  well other than thatPLEASE GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW   RUN IF YOU HAVE TO , OSCARS ARE BUZZING",The Prince of Egypt
271,alexis-15,a must-see!!!,10,5 January 1999,this is a wonderful movie where one does not need to be familiar with Christian or Jewish beliefs to understand the story.  This is something children of all ages can enjoy.  The animation was a nice integration of both traditional and CGI..,The Prince of Egypt
272,Busara,An awesome animated epic,9,24 December 1998,"I have never been so enthusiastic about a movie, before actually having seen it. When the Prince of Egypt soundtrack was released, I bought it immediately and listened to it over and over again. It was so incredibly wonderful, it really made me want to see the movie as well.And it was such a wonderful experience... I have never experienced this amount of emotion and power before in an animated movie. I am a really big fan of animated movies, and I love Disney's animated features. DreamWorks' Prince of Egypt really is such a wondrous movie, it really improves on a lot of Disney movies, in my humble opinion. The story is so strong, and the Moses and Rameses characters are so well developed, the animation is awesome, and the music.. Well, that is really something I will never forget. Hans Zimmer and Stephen Schwartz have done their most wonderful work so far. The score and songs are truly unforgettable. And when you hear the music and experience the animation together, you have the movie that is called Prince of Egypt.Truly a wonderful movie! And my alltime-favorite movie so far. Well done DreamWorks! Many thanks for making it!",The Prince of Egypt
273,faris,read this,10,26 December 1998,"This film cannot be credited enough... everything in it is done to the limits of perfection. This movie is not just a flick, a 'darn good' or 'entertaining' film... it's an event. DreamWorks deserves all the praise and success for this thunderingly triumphant marvel. A must see for everyone!",The Prince of Egypt
274,gbcox,"Excellent Animation, but...",8,30 December 1998,"Story seemed to end rather quickly.  Perhaps I was just expecting to see an animated Edgar G. Robinson dance around a golden calf; instead the sea parts and the credits roll.  A must see, if for nothing else the unbelievable animation.  Superb effort on Dreamworks part, however the Lion King still reigns supreme as the best animated feature to date IMHO.",The Prince of Egypt
275,devsaw16,Disney gets competition!! BIG TIME!,10,1 January 1999,"I was in awe the entire time I was watching The Prince of Egypt. This movie is no doubt ""king"" over Disney.  The animation, voices, and music are wonderful!  I really hope Dreamworks continues with the Biblical animation, because it is truly remarkable.  If you are religious, you will get more out of it, but if you are not, you will still enjoy it.",The Prince of Egypt
276,marky-9,A great movie for everyone!,9,5 January 1999,"For those who haven't seen it, don't be too sure you know whom this movie is really about. Because, if you think it's just about Moses, you might just miss one of the most emotionally-convincing performances by a animated character - the one given by brother Ramses (a Prince too!) It's simply a beautiful movie with a lot to tell, and I thank Dreamworks for the wonderful job they have done.",The Prince of Egypt
277,MBrenner,Good if your last name is Flanders,3,23 January 1999,"If your last name is Flanders and you´re living next door to the Simpsons, then you´ll propably like this movie. Started out ok, but as soon as the religious themes came into play it Moses became really serious and it all got rather boring (if you know the plot already). Good visuals, but no Mulan.",The Prince of Egypt
278,Ross-23,"A great piece of animation, but with a highly important theme",7,11 February 1999,"I expected the Prince of Egypt to be another 'run of the mill' cartoon which makes you say 'Wow, great animation!' but one which you basically forget about the next day. I was wrong.As a Christian, I fully expected the film to take the story of Moses and jazz it up out of all proportion, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story remained one of pretty much Biblical accuracy. Obviously some artistic license has to be taken to make the film more appealing to children and the non-Christian.Almost to take a swipe at Disney, the Prince of Egypt oozes fluid animation and the water effects especially are the best I've seen in a cartoon. If any producers are going to pull Disney from its perch, Dreamworks will definitely be the ones to do it. Rarely have I seen animation of this quality before.But the classy look of this film only hides its true nature as a Biblical story. The film delivers the story of Exodus admirably, with just enough humour and artistic license to keep the children interested. On a deeper, more spiritual level the film excels though. The story of Moses is not an easy one to come to grips with in the Bible and to see it brought to life on the big screen was a joy to behold. The burning bush scene was one of the most powerful, moving pieces of cinema I have experienced and the red sea scene was almost as powerful in it's own right. Obviously from a Christian viewpoint, this film couldn't have been made any better. To somebody else however, the Prince of Egypt also has so much to offer: Great animation, a cracking story and a good dose of humour. I highly recommend this film to anybody and everybody.",The Prince of Egypt
279,Kaine-2,The Best Movie I EVER Saw!!!,10,11 October 1999,"I absolutely LOVED this movie from beginning to end.  I have NEVER been to a movie that ""grabbed"" me like this one did.  The scene with the burning bush....there is no words for it.  When I first saw it (and every time since), you could literally FEEL the presence of God in the theater. Plus, the music is totally AWESOME!!  I mean, you have Mariah Carey & Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, Take 6, BeBe & CeCe Winans, Steven Curtis Chapman, Alabama, Randy Travis and Linda Davis, Toby Keith, Charlie Daniels, Clint Black, Carman, plus an all-star song of which the actors and artists sing together.  I highly recommend this movie and music to everyone!",The Prince of Egypt
280,illian1of7,marvelous....,10,21 November 2000,"As sappy as this may sound, I cried. I greatly enjoyed this religious film, even though the story was imperfect; the true spirit and essence of the story dominates this spiritual film about the Exodus.  As well I feel that the voices behind the characters put great love into what they did, and anyone that listens can hear it. The artistry and sound track are of great compliment to this film, and I believe this will become a great classic.",The Prince of Egypt
281,ctenuicornis,I don't think I have a word to describe this movie.,10,28 October 2019,"First of all, I'm an atheist. Second, I watched this movie expecting the worst. When I saw ""Biblical"", ""Animated"" and ""Musical"" in the tags I thought ""Hey, this might be one of those movies that are so bad they are hilarious"". I've never been so wrong in my entire life, and I couldn't be more glad.
Not only is my favorite animated movie, it even is one of my favorite movies in general.
I will not reveal nothing about it. ""The Prince of Egypt"" is a must-see, doesn't matter if you are jewish, christian, atheist or whatever. It's not about the religion, it's about the message that leaves, it's about seeing those wonderful animations, it's about listening to that beautiful soundtrack.",The Prince of Egypt
282,emdoebel,The best animated film you will ever watch!,10,29 July 2021,"I absolutely loved this movie as a kid and now as an adult! I used to listen to the soundtrack every night and re-enact scenes with my sister. I just watched this movie for the first time as an adult, and I can't get over how great of a movie it still is! The music and animation are phenomenal! The scene cuts in combination with the music gave me chills. The cast is a bunch of superstars. I mean, how did they get all of these famous actors and musicians in one film with music by Hans Zimmer? A must see for all ages!",The Prince of Egypt
283,alefantini,Fantastic,10,29 April 2021,"To say that i watched it 100 times is an understatement..the film of my childhood..spectacular music, top films.",The Prince of Egypt
284,adenarclark,This Is An Amazing Classic,9,8 September 2021,This movie is a beautiful telling of the story of Moses and his relationship with God. This movie has always made me feel such amazing emotions ever since I was a kid. I believe this movie is one of the big reasons that I love the Lord and what he has given us.I rate this movie a 9/10.,The Prince of Egypt
285,Ben_Lakind,Just. Wow.,9,18 October 2021,"Remember when Dreamworks didn't make Shrek yet? I do. And no film better represents those days than The Prince of Egypt. (Not to befoul Shrek, I enjoy it and its sequel, but it left a negative impact on Dreamworks as a whole.) While some would say it copies the stylings of Disney movies, I would say that it goes far beyond the likes of a lot of Disney's hand-drawn films. Sure, it's no Beauty and the Beast, but it comes close and that's saying something. Not only that, but the movie isn't incredibly racist like Peter Pan, Aristocats, or Lady and the Tramp, so it has that going for it. Anyways, back to the movie. The Prince of Egypt from start to finish is a work of genius. And what better way to highlight it than in what is most obvious about it: the art. It is staggering to see how gorgeous the movie is. There aren't any shortcuts taken at all, like reusing shots or simplifying character designs from a distance. Every character, location, background, and action are drawn with a high degree of life and quality. Aside from the parts with magic and whatnot, you can really imagine that Egypt once looked like it did in the film and that the people really looked like they did. Despite its dark tone in the second and third acts, The Prince of Egypt remains remarkably colorful, unlike a similar film like Exodus: Gods and Kings, which was consistently quite drab. Color choices, like designating blue to Egyptians and orange to Hebrews, were creatively used in lots of dynamic shots. And the clever uses of positioning are great ways of making foreshadowing and metaphors. Either way, enough about the art, let's talk about music. In this regard, The Prince of Egypt outdoes Beauty and The Beast. In that film, music is used as a way (mostly) to lighten the mood and distract from the movie's dark themes. In The Prince of Egypt, the songs work WITH the emotions in effective ways. Although some of them were a little... odd, like Playing With the Big Boys, others like All I Ever Wanted, Deliver Us, Heaven's Eyes, The Plagues, and the Oscar-winning song When you Believe perfectly encapsulate the scenes they accompany. Not only that, (and this is important,) but these songs have a reason to be in the story. A lot of musicals have a problem for me when I see them, and that is that there is no reason for a song to be there when it is there. Hamilton, although being a sung-through show, definitely exhibits this issue in a lot of spots where they choose flash over substance. Even Disney movies like Frozen, The Little Mermaid, and High School Musical all share this problem. The same cannot be said here. Most times that characters sing there is express purpose put in it. When the Hebrews sing When You Believe, they add in a prayer called the Mi Chamocha, which corresponds to the events in the Torah. The prayer basically means ""How awesome are you, the one and only God, who has freed us from bondage. Who is like you in your love?"" It makes perfect sense. When Tzippora's father sings Heaven's Eyes, he does so at a festival of song and dance to teach Moses about its themes, and it fits well. I could go on about this for a while, but the last important point I want to make is about the vocal performances. The cast really shines in this movie. Although it does follow the trend of casting celebrity voices in the larger roles. This is seen especially by Jeff Goldblum's usual routine for Aaron, but some actors were cast because of how well they fit their parts. No better example can be seen from Ofra Haza's performance as Yochaved. She only appears in the first scene of the movie, Haza delivers an incredibly powerful presence in the film. Being that she is fluent in Hebrew, the songwriters were able to take advantage of that and gave her Hebrew to sing. Not to mention that she sang beautifully. Other actors actually do fit well with their parts, like Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes. These two create a believable dynamic between Moses and Rameses, which makes the scenes they share work all the better. Although the film does use alternate performers for songs, it does help keep the quality of the singing at a high standard. Long story short, good movie. Why don't more people watch it?",The Prince of Egypt
286,lil_angel026,This is based on the Bible's historical story about Moses located in the book of Exodus.,10,6 June 2009,"I do not understand why the rating currently is 6.8. I believe it is because some non religious people are hating on this just because it is based on God's historical stories.THIS IS A 10 or 9 for sure.The script, music, voice talents, backgrounds, and animation is amazing.There is also the right amount of humor. There is so much emotion and it is a moving and touching film.There is so much passion as well and good values and morals.Also, it relates to us in so many ways.",The Prince of Egypt
287,finn-72,Religious musical,1,21 June 2012,"Honestly I believe religions are generally the root of most conflicts, terror, wars and discrimination against women, races and gay people. This one-dimensional movie is a perfect bullseye for all Born Again Christians and Jews. For those of us who know as opposed to believe, this movie is a children's cartoon of the bible for use in church.Furthermore i hate the concept of musicals. This movie is perhaps even more of a musical parody than Monthy Pythons ""Every sperm is sacred"". The tunes are annoying, the lyrics are pathetic.You only live once. Don't waste your precious time on this movie. Watch the grass grow in stead.I hope DreamWorks who has given us great animated fantasy movies can keep their hands off missionary works like this in the future.",The Prince of Egypt
288,bridgette-hq28,Catchy music AND an awesome story,10,14 February 2010,"This movie was great!!! Beyond great actually. It was inspiring and after watching it, it made me want to become a better person. It was incredibly moving- I even cried!!one of the few animated movies that have had the ability to actually make me cry- if not one of them, the only one! the characters have so much depth. and if you ask me, it's the characters what make a great movie not the story. But this one definitely had a great story. this is a universal story for goodness sake. Best version of the story Moses yet!!! it's fun and you learn the moral of the story too. Best animation movie ever!! way better than Disney. Disney movies brainwash kids and make it seem as if life is a freaking fun house. In the end, all that is left is a kid with crushed dreams and a broken heart. but this movie is REAL- if you get what i mean! it gives you the real answer to everything and that is faith and God. if you have those 2 things in your life, your set man. oh and this movie really made me contemplate a bunch and reflect on myself. at the end of the movie, in one way or another you become more religious and spiritual. hope this helped!",The Prince of Egypt
289,Wiley,Worth seeing again and again; great music!,10,27 February 1999,"Put aside all of the talk about technique and animation achievements (although these are done excellently) and enjoy the story for its triumph and splendor of the delivery of God's people.  One comment about the animation needs to be said:  The emotions of the characters are depicted splendidly, especially by the use of great breathing detail (watch for deep sighs and heaving chests).The sound track is worth having on its own merit.  Excellent work by the composer.",The Prince of Egypt
290,wise_owl,Better than anything Diseny has produced,10,20 December 1998,I saw this movie and was amazed the story was not dumbed down like Disney movies.  The animation was great.  The lyrics were wonderful.  I can't wait to see it again.,The Prince of Egypt
291,Naor,Splendid Animation; Fearful Story Line,7,19 December 1998,"Speaking from an aspect concerning art and music, The Prince of Egypt is a magnificent and thrilling animation. However, in the film, God's infliction of suffering upon Egyptians to his mass elimination of them is just unbearably disturbing. Also, certain aspects in the film create some unjust biases that may have successfully achieved its dramatic effect, but they also reduce its credibility, which makes the film less enjoyable.",The Prince of Egypt
292,F$hyde,Credit where credit is due,8,28 December 1998,"This is very possibly the finest animation I've seen.  Before commenting on the film as a whole, I want to make that clear, because in the inevitable rush to pick this film apart (the plot, the voices, the religious significance, the literary accuracy, the moral issues, the music, the comparisons with Disney and de Mille, etc...) one might easily become distracted from the aesthetic and technical triumphs of The Prince of Egypt, and that would be unfortunate.  As someone who has an interest and appreciation of animation, I can say that this is the first film I've seen that successfully integrates computer-generated animation and traditional animation (and I've seen many attempts).  More importantly, as someone who has eyes, I can say that the result is a visual experience of intense style and beauty.  In fact, the initial depiction of Egypt is so breathtaking, that it seriously hinders the film's later efforts to vilify it.Comparisons with Disney are inevitable, especially because Prince of Egypt employs tired Disney formula in an attempt, I assume, to remain economically viable.  What a shame, since Disney hasn't made a decent film since Aladdin. I am referring, of course, to the unnecessary musical numbers and the two high priests, the film's comic relief, who are drawn grossly out of proportion to the other characters.  Even worse than their unoriginality, however, is the open mockery of ancient Egyption religion and culture, which these two characters embody.  I found their musical number especially appalling.  On the other hand, it's a story in which the protagonists succeed only through a greater capacity for cruelty and destruction and the slaughter of innocent children, so it's kind of hard to nail down any concrete moral standard here.In general, I thought the story was well told, with solid direction and a good script.  The only complaint I have about the voice acting is that Jeff Goldblum's unmistakable mannerisms seriously distract from his character.  I suspect that I wasn't really bothered by the others only because I hadn't seen a cast list before seeing the film.  I wish they would stop relying on celebrity voices for animated features.  No character can be effective if the viewer can't separate the voice from the actor supplying it.The bottom line is, despite any objections, complaints, or concerns I might have about this film, despite the moral, religious, or idealogical issues it brings up, and despite the $8 and two hours you'll spend, this film is worth seeing.  It's worth seeing because of the animation.  I hope it sets a new standard for feature-length animated films.  At the very least, I think it will show the movie-going public what the medium is capable of.",The Prince of Egypt
293,rbartee2,Weak Story Line,5,24 December 1998,"If you want to educate your kids about the story of Moses and the Exodus, rent The Ten Commandmants.  Prince of Egypt is entertaining, has outstanding animation with some spectacular new animation effects.  But it does not tell the story. There is no explanation of the taking of the First Born, no explanation of the plagues, etc.  As a teaching device, I found it sorely lacking in its story telling ability.",The Prince of Egypt
294,Ed-69,Why animated?,6,24 December 1998,"OK,The film looks great, great story etc. But why animated? It really lacks humor. Look at the animated version of Lord of the Rings. Serious animation doesn't work.",The Prince of Egypt

Overall I though it was a good movie, much in the spirit of Disney. The only thing that bothered me was that the animation was a mix of techniques, going from bad to dead right gorgeous (the hyroglyphs animation, the water in the basket scene, the open the red sea scene, etc...). I would not think of it as a season's movie, but the story is of all ages.",The Prince of Egypt
296,Antoine-7,"superb settings, very poor animation",5,14 January 1999,"Clearly a lot of effort has gone into all the spectacular scenes - and they are, indeed, spectacular.This makes it all the more difficult to understand why when characters simply walk, the animation becomes incredibly poor (leg movements do not match the speed of displacement).On top of that, and even if the Hebrews are the heroes of Exodus, historical evidence suggests that Ramses II was a very smart, thoughtful, ethical monarch - there was no need to display him as such a near-idiot.",The Prince of Egypt
297,Gershwin,Movie was a surprisingly accurate version of the Exodus,9,20 December 1998,"Because the character of Moses is a central religious figure of the Jewish and Christian faiths, I was surprised to see the modern media be as accurate as the great masters of old films were with The Ten Commandments. The music is delightful and central to the plot, not songs just for entertainment and promotional rights. The writers and directors were true to the Torah in many respects and deserve admiration for not changing the story to be one without Jehovah. Bravo!!!",The Prince of Egypt

300,Sete,The most brilliant animated movie i've ever seen,10,28 December 1998,"Since the first time i saw this movie's trailer, i knew that it might be one of the best movies ever made. And it is. The story, the animation, the soundtrack are so powerful that even made me cry a couple of times. It's the kind of piece of art that touches your heart, not by the drama, but by the beauty of it. Disney would never dream of making a movie like this, because they are always worried about entertaining children. Dreamworks went further and was able to make a fantastic animated movie for everyone, no matter how old everyone is.",The Prince of Egypt
301,MrSeven,We have been delivered,8,26 December 1998,"It is an accomplishment to see that a major movie studio has bested Disney in creating an animated motion picture that doesn't fall prey to the excessive ""cutesy"" tendencies that befall most animated pics. While the rest of the world, countries such as Japan for instance, has moved ahead in establishing animation as an actual art form, it is still regulated as something that enjoys only the likes of a Saturday morning audience or a weekend afternoon matinee. DreamWorks has succeeded in bringing animation to a new level of evolution in ""The Prince of Egypt."" While the studio has promoted the film was one intended towards mature, or adult, audiences, it is indeed for the entire family. But see it with intelligence and culture that you wouldn't have when seeing a movie such as ""Mulan"" or even ""Anastasia."" ""The Prince of Egypt"" never succumbs to the cliches of its animated predecessors. Others can learn from this example. I have already seen the teaser for Walt Disney's ""Tarzan"" and the web site for Warner Bros. ""The King and I."" I just hope that they live up to the fine standards POE has set for animation, because anything else after this DreamWorks epic completely bites the dust.The score of the movie has been underplayed greatly by most reviewers. However, I recommended purchasing the main soundtrack. While I haven't listened to the movie's other two albums, the main soundtrack is a thoroughly invigorating experience that not only captures the spirit of the movie, but brings to remembrance the visual details that made POE such a breathtaking experience. My favorite tracks: the powerful ""Deliver Us,"" which opened the movie; ""Through Heaven's Eyes"" (movie version); ""The Burning Bush""; ""The Plagues""; ""Death of the First Born""; and ""When You Believe"" (movie version). Note that many of my favorite tracks are comprised mostly of the movie score than actual vocals. Hans Zimmer has done a magnificent job of creating instrumentation that goes along with the movie, much like Jerry Goldsmith did with the ""Star Trek"" movies and even James Horner with ""Titanic."" Enjoy the movie, revel in the soundtrack. ""The Prince of Egypt"" will deliver you.",The Prince of Egypt
302,eahjd,This is really a magnificent movie.,10,17 December 1998,"This is really a magnificent movie.  It tells the story of Moses in an emotionally powerful manner without going overboard, and takes advantage of all animation has to offer without becoming patronizing like so many other animated films.  This is definitely not a film aimed at the 12-and-under crowd, but instead has a very mature sensibility.  I usually can find some points to criticize even in movies I thoroughly enjoy, but I really can't find anything negative to say about this one.  It's wonderful.",The Prince of Egypt

304,YLejeune,Quite excellent but strange,8,17 December 1998,I hadn't seen an animated movie like this before. I think it shows Katzenberg's wish to produce adult animated movie.

306,hamartia,"Its reach exceeds its grasp, but what's a Heaven for?",8,16 December 1998,"On 98/12/15, I saw ""Prince of Egypt"" under unique conditions: at the Academy's own superb theater, with a professional audience which included the producers. The reaction was decidedly mixed, in keeping with the film itself. There were peaks of artistic illustration, technical effects, and expressive acting perhaps never before seen either in an animated feature or in a religiously themed American studio film of any type. There were also mediocre songs; gratuitous moments of cartoony cuteness; distracting and all-too-recognizable star voices for ill-defined, anachronistic secondary characters. The result was, in a word, uneven, with strikingly good and dismayingly bad things occurring not only in adjacent scenes, but often simultaneously.If all this sounds like what Katenberg (and Spielberg) always do, or so I believe -- attempt A+ work with at best B+ talent, judgement, and consistency -- and if you agree with that assertion, then you'll find this film well worth seeing, but far from the timeless masterpiece that its provenance and subject will likely cause mass-market reviewers to proclaim.In Katzenberg's best films for Disney, and now with ""Prince of Egypt"" we are watching a revival of the impossible dream of ""Fantasia"" -- feature-length animation which is brave, artistic, serious, entertaining, popular, and profitable -- all at once. That's more than most ""live"" films ever attain, including the junk which occupies each year's list of top grosses and top awards. I hope that this film is a big hit worldwide, that SKG reinvests the profits in even braver animated projects, and that someday we remember ""Prince of Egypt"" as a significant milestone along the way to masterpieces done in styles, and with tools, we can't even name yet.",The Prince of Egypt
307,Ina,PRINCE OF EGYPT TOTALLY ROCKS!,10,19 December 1998,"Amazing animation, superb voice acting, and a fresh new look at the Moses story. I think this is how biblical icons should be portrayed.

The idea that they hurt and have situation and personality conflicts just like everyone else's makes them more real! ^_^. Seeing a fresh perspective on an age-old story definitely rekindled my interest in the scriptures.Being an animation buff as well, I am EXTREMELY happy to see that the animation story telling has been brought up one notch higher. I think the music, specially ""Deliver Us"" and ""The Plagues"" were sensational... though I was a bit disappointed that the movie turned out to be another musical.

I was sure I had my expectations so high, I was bound to be disappointed... Boy was I wrong.Not only is the story [for the most part] biblically accurate (according to DreamWorks, some changes had to be made to make the story a little more interesting for our modern culture), but the animation is outstanding! We get so used to the typical Disney animation that when we see something that's not Disney, it takes us a little while to get used to it. Once you do though, you will LOVE this film!This is by far the best animated motion picture *I* have ever seen. The special effects are right on par with sci-fi movies like Armageddon or Men In Black.I'm sure there will be some people that will find this movie dull or stupid, but this is a MUST SEE at least once for everyone... I've already seen it twice, and it opened 3 days ago! WELL worth a good 6 bucks, and if you like it, probably worth another 6. =)",The Prince of Egypt
310,DarkJedi-5,This was an awesome movie!!!,8,21 December 1998,"This was probably one of the greatest animated movies of all-time. Only ""The Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"" could compete with it, in my opinion.Good points: Unbelievable animation (hieroglyph dream, pillar of fire, and the parting of the Red Sea come to mind), great cast (which is pretty obvious), good story (not much credit to DreamWorks, since I'm talking about the plot).Bad point(s): Seemed a little too short. I left the theatre craving more. (kinda stupid, I know)Remaining points: The music is the only thing that I was a little indecisive about. It was good, but not as good as songs from ""The Lion King"" and others. Still, there's good chance for an Oscar for ""When You Believe"". (Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey sing it better than the people in the movie)Bottom line: This was an excellent movie that I would recommend to anyone. It seems to be directed at an older audience, but it still appeals to everyone. Great work by Jeffrey Katzenberg and DreamWorks.",The Prince of Egypt
311,POE-10,"Move over Disney, you're working with the big boys now.....",10,25 December 1998,"It was weird......the first time I saw POE I was dragged to the theaters by my older sister because she read the reviews of the movie and she had high expectations. I expected another poor animated movie (like Disney always puts out), but was amazed when I saw Moses' mother put him into the river. After the powerful opening song ""Deliver Us"" and beautiful characters and scenery, I was glued to the screen. The hold story was told so perfectly and so wonderfully that I am amazed that I was so stupid as to think that I wouldn't like it. When the life was taken from each first born child I was in complete and utter awe. It was so wonderfully eerie and mystical that it was exactly the way it should be. The parting of the Red Sea was magnificent! When I saw the big whale in the water I thought that it was just made up, but later my sister revealed to me that people actually saw the fish swimming around in the wall of water. Breathtaking is the only word for that movie! I know what my new favorite movie is and it's not ""A Bug's Life!"" It's definitely ""The Prince of Egypt"".",The Prince of Egypt

313,Tumor,Almost a great,8,21 December 1998,"Well well well...  Dreamworks seems to finally be putting out movies that are worthy of the people behind it.  Let's face it, Dreamworks came out with some pretty disappointing features.  However, with Saving Private Ryan, and now Prince of Egypt, Speilberg, Katzenberg, and Geffen seem to have gotten their act together.  However, I still feel that they could have done a better job with Prince of Egypt.  The Animation was awesome, and the talent behind the characters was good as well.  However, the story seemed a bit lacking, and although they approached it with the appropriate seriousness, it just didn't seem as powerful as Moses' story could be.The singing was dry, and sometimes just didn't seem like it fit.  Perhaps, like Disney, it might have been better to have found separate talking and singing voices.  Also, it seemed like the movie borrowed a lot from other movies.  There was a distinct ""Lion Kingness"" <Katzenberg and Zimmer?>, and certain scenes just felt borrowed.  However... the animation, again,  was just purely amazing, like nothing I've seen before. And Moses' dream, where the hieroglyphics come to life, was breathtaking.Dreamworks has made a good start with animation with Prince of Egypt, and the movie is really good, however, it seemed to lack a complete feel of its own, and a feeling of completeness.  I cannot say it parred with the Disney glory streak <Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Lion King>, but hey, I don't think anybody <including Disney> will EVER be able to do it again.",The Prince of Egypt
314,duloc,"Beauty and Emotion, Well Done.",10,6 January 1999,"The Prince of Egypt, explored so many new artistic avenues, it would be impossible to list them.But, what impressed me the most, was the extensive production design and character development of the film. Great  movement in the animation. The opening sequence of the basket on the river is a perfect example.The story doesn't drag anywhere!! Very well written, great dialog. There is humor, sensitivity, drama, a touch of magic and a great deal of majesty.The story has morals we can all share & follow, as well as heart wrenching emotions. Makes you think about your own family and faith. Made me reconsider some other world issues of present dayand how history repeats itself.Seeing how these two brothers related to one another and then seeing them being torn apart, lost to each other was extreme, but real. The scene of Ramses at the end when he cries out for Moses, was one of pure despair, the look on Moses face, when he heard his  voice is the evidence of how much they both lost.Moses may have freed his people, but he lost his childhood friend and brother. Consider Rameses. They were both tied to fate. Great Sacrifices.Between them there was an obvious element of respect, love and loyalty.Something that got lost in the Ten Commandments. With this I wanted to re - read the Bible, something I haven't done for a long time.What DreamWorks did was invite us to consider how far would we go, to protect something we hold sacred?The imagery, story and music (all the various versions) are exceptional. These talented Animators showed us how to push the envelope.It will be interesting to see how DreamWorks tops this Film.",The Prince of Egypt
315,kem-2,Awesome Animation,10,26 December 1998,I took my two children 8 and 6 to see The Prince of Egypt. I was totally captivated. The animation was beautiful and splendidly done. The Red Sea scene gave me chill bumps. I could almost imagine being there. It was awesome.The soundtrack was beautiful. The story flowed and kept my children mesmerized. It was the best movie I've seen in a long while.,The Prince of Egypt
316,Starrman,A Great Musical Experience!,9,28 December 1998,"I've read several of the comments about this movie and as usual see both sides.  I loved the movie and it was actually much better than I thought it would be.  The thing that impressed me the most was the music.  I love it's mournful sound and good themes.  However, the ""Playing With the Big Boys"" song was not included with the rest of the music though.  That song and scene did not work for me, but all of the music besides that was incredible! I also did not like the chariot scene though, finding it very unbelievable, overdone, and unnecessary. I am a great lover of score and music from movies, and this one is my present favorite.  I was proud that Dreamworks was not afraid to keep the religious nature of this story without stepping over the line and push any particular religion.  It was an uplifting movie and definitely not a children's movie.  As also said, this movie should not be compared to the great epic The Ten Commandments.  It is focused on Moses & Ramses' relationships as brothers and not on the children of Israels' journey to the promised land.  The special effects were wonderful as well and the movie really impressed me.  I feel like the best scene in the movie though is the opening with the song ""Deliver Us.""  It was a great opening and really got you into the movie.  If you haven't seen this movie, GO SEE IT!!",The Prince of Egypt
317,krist10,a marvelous animated feature film,10,2 January 1999,"I suppose some people try to find something to complain about when viewing a film, but as I sit here reviewing this splendid film, I cannot understand the comments made as to the power of the message of the picture. Having being done before, this retelling of the story of moses stays close to the biblical tale as told in the book of exodus. What we should be talking about is the magnifiient animation of the burning bush, the chariot race, the plagues, the dream, the opening of the red sea, and the splendid musical soundtrack, theme, and songs, which I am now humming.  OSCARS await this outstanding film.",The Prince of Egypt

In my opinion it is truly the best animated movie of 1998!The special effects stunning and the character design refreshing. All in all, Dreamworks has a winner.  Not bad for a crew that comprises mostly of very talented European Artists who were not all poached from Disney.",The Prince of Egypt
319,Sana-2,The movie is great!!!!,10,2 February 1999,"This movie is one of the greatest ever! I like it very, very much. It's a great start for Dreamworks. Unlike some other people, I think it was a good idea to make an animated movie about the Bible story and Moses. Animation is great, music also and it's good they made some characters funny. I think it would be a shame to miss a great movie like this one is. So go and see it!!!",The Prince of Egypt
320,reneeord,Takes animation to new heights - deserves best picture,9,4 January 1999,"The film tells the familiar story of Moses through stunning animation. Three sequences really stand out - Moses' dream, the plagues, and the parting of the Red Sea.  Little of the cliched Disney formula is included here.  The story is a serious and tragic drama, aimed at older children and adults.  Don't wait to see this on video - make sure you see it on the biggest screen you can find.",The Prince of Egypt
321,Eddie-67,A terrific movie for the whole family to enjoy.,10,5 January 1999,I was pleased with the producers efforts to make an entertaining picture and yet remain generally true to the biblical account.  The animation was outstanding.  I enjoyed the music.  I wish it could have lasted longer.The only negative were the trailers that were attached to the front end of the movie.  Two of them were offensive and inappropriate for a family movie audience.  I presume that was a local theater decision.,The Prince of Egypt
322,Mormon,"Fictious entertainment, not scripturally correct.",3,18 January 1999,"If you wish to be entertained with fiction, then, this movie does that. However, if you are looking for true facts and principles to be portrayed, notwithstanding the artistic license, then, this is not the film for you. Neither the pharaoh's wife nor Moses' brother play their scriptural roles, which are an integral part to the truthfulness of the story.  Thus, the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie is incorrect.  This movie IS NOT in keeping with the Judeo-Christian records of what actually happened.  To avoid disappointment, do not view this film on its biblical merits, but strictly on its artistic and creative merits.",The Prince of Egypt
323,OhioEric,"Good, but not great.",8,24 January 1999,"The storyline of this movie was close to the biblical story of Exodus. There were certain embellishments, as to be expected.The animation was not all that great. The effects of the parting of the Red Sea was good, but the general drawing of the people in the story left a lot to be desired.The music was, in my opinion, the weakest link in this movie. I honestly could not tell you a single line from any song. It was very forgettable -- and rather contrived. For no apparent reason, a song would break out.Nonetheless, this was a good movie. It is nice to be able to go to a movie and not be assaulted by vulgarity or sexuality thrown in just to appeal to the masses. I liked the fact that part of the believer's heritage is written about in the mainstream media.Overall, this movie got an 8 from me.",The Prince of Egypt
324,Ed-152,Suck-rific,1,13 March 1999,"In every possible respect, this movie was meritless.The animation was poor. I particularly enjoyed our protagonists grotesquely misshapen head.The music was awful, and I mean both the score itself and the performance. I've never quite cringed the way I did tonight when that nauseating theme recurred for the five thousandth time.I guess it makes sense that the singing was so sub-par, considering they managed to blow all their money on gratuitous, excessive, repeatedly egregious computer graphics. When Passover comes, the ""death blob"" looks more like a plasma weapon from a orbiting alien battle cruiser. The parting of the Red Sea was nice though, in a ""if we make it all spurting water, we don't actually have to draw any characters"" sort of way.The comic ""relief"" provided by Ra's high priests was completely out of place, and a transparent attempt to emulate Disney's habit of incorporating a pair of funny side kicks.Why is it that, in every movie dealing with Egypt in that time period, an explanation is inevitably provided for the Sphinx's missing nose? Really, dreamworks, how trite.I'd like to end by saying that the entire group I went with feels the same, and that we are now going to scrub ourselves with wire brushes to see if we can get the dirtiness off.Oh, but it was a good movie though, yah.",The Prince of Egypt
325,dpeter,The Best!!,10,25 March 1999,"This movie is the best I've seen! The story line is great. The minor changes that some people are irritated about, made it shorter and more understandable for kids. The animation is spectacular. I especially liked the plagues, bush and red sea. None of Disneys movies come close to the realistic graphics and movement of Prince of Egypt. For those of you who think the characters aren't drawn well, take a look at Disney's geometrical barbie doll like figures in Pocahontas. Humans are very hard to animate and get the movement right on. Dreamworks did the best I've seen. Other movies such as Beauty and the Beast, Anastasia and Aladdin used 3d in a forced way; just throwing in a shot here and there to make you go ""wow"". This movie used 3d so much that it seems like your really there. The parting of the Red Sea is something you won't forget. This movie gives God power that no live action movie could.",The Prince of Egypt

It's so beautiful, and it gives me so much to think and wonder about. I'm still thinking about it. I want to go and see it again. I may or may not do that. I realise that the reason I want to see it again is that it inspires a deep yearning in me for depth and beauty and purity and truth and love.

What would be so wrong with showing us the story, let us enjoy the view, without constantly making the characters abandon all natural behaviour and sing, relentlessly ?

331,t34617,Thank you,10,15 May 2006,"As a father of three, the content is becoming more difficult to intercept, screen, and filter what my kids watch or listen too. Even religious values in our family have to be safe-guarded considering how studios cater to scripts that focus on ratings, and not the written truth.With the release of The Prince of Egypt, the sensitivity to the story, staying in line with the biblical standard, was refreshing. Although every story written about this story has some embellishment, the focus in this movie highlighted the characters, plot points, emphasizing the human factors, and genuinely developing understanding.My first impression when the movie opened was the rich musical scores that propelled the story. Aside from the visual presentation, the songs leaped out at me, lifting my soul, reeling me into the story, and nearly giving me the sense that I was experiencing it first hand! Our family thoroughly enjoys this movie, even today, watching it often. I have the soundtrack and listen to it while trucking around the nation. I'm especially thankful for all the artist that contributed their talent to this movie. Aside from the opening titles, I'm impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's signing talent in the song, When You Believe. The lyrics alone are written to inspire. When Michelle Pfeiffer sings this song, the message comes alive, echoing truth, emphasizing on the strife, and reveling in the human condition.There is so much to say and yet the best has been noted. The score, movie, and voice-overs is by far, the best presentation on film, in a very long time. If you haven't seen this one, make the effort.",The Prince of Egypt
332,ohsosoftcotton,"Flawed, but Good",7,4 July 2006,"Prince of Egypt was a good movie. I enjoyed it thoroughly. The animation was good, and visually interesting. The basic plot was alike to that of the Exodus story. I also appreciated the feeling behind Moses' character. He struggled with God's request to save his people. He felt for his brother, for his people, and even for suffering Egypt.However, there were a few points where the movie fell short of my hopes.First, many plot details were changed. In the bible, Ramases is never named as Moses' brother. On the other hand, it added needed emotional conflict to the film. Therefore, making Pharaoh Moses' brother is almost justified. However, there is no reference to Moses' meeting his wife before he ran from Egypt in the bible. This part of the story I was unnecessary and dis-likable. Dialogue does not match the bible, but there is little in the actual story, so this is understandable.Second, some of the music was cheesy. Each song got across a main idea, but some lacked flow and beauty.Third, some of the dialogue are awkward.In conclusion, I will say that the movie is better for a younger audience, but if you do not judge the movie to eagerly, you too will enjoy it.",The Prince of Egypt

It's not a coincidence that they're all now considered underrated classics, and Prince of Persia trumps every one of these.A perfect cast, stunningly beautiful animation and some of the best music ever written for a movie all come together to tell the best version of this classic story ever told.Just watch it.",The Prince of Egypt
335,acroginnygirl,An excellent family movie,9,7 December 2006,"I absolutely loved this movie. When I first saw it, I was ten. I enjoyed it then, and I still enjoy it to this day. The movie teaches children a great history lesson along with moral values. The musical numbers in the movie help keep the audience's attention while incorporating bible verses and values. The quality of color, animation and sound in the movie is excellent. This is a movie that the entire family can sit down and truly enjoy together. Children of all ages can relate to the characters and the dilemmas these characters experience. Most of the facts presented in the movie are accurate. Thus this movie is an excellent representation of ancient Egypt and is a great movie for the entire family to watch. The Prince of Egypt is as great of a family movie as, for example, Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat. Both movies teach the same history and values. When, in the future, I wish to educate my children about the first testament, Passover, or Moses, I most definitely will show them this move. I feel that, by watching this movie, not only will they be entertained, but my children would have gained knowledge about Passover and the culture of ancient Egypt, and that we would have spent an amazing hour and a half together.",The Prince of Egypt
336,heathlee,accuracy according to the Bible,8,27 September 2006,"I really enjoyed the movie, so much that I bought it, but I would have enjoyed it even more if it had been more accurate, seeing as it's based on a story from the Bible.I noticed 3 things that in my opinion weren't accurate: 1. Moses was about 80 years old when he led the Israelites out of Egypt.2. There's no mention of Moses having a brother named Rameses, rather, it was a place (Exodus 12:37; Genesis 47:11) 3. In the movie, Rameses escapes being destroyed when the waters of the Red Sea return, but the Bible says that not so much as one of them was let remain (Exodus 14:26-28; Psalm 136:15) Other than that, great movie!",The Prince of Egypt

One of Disney's greatest masterpieces, it actually sent chills down my spine to watch the legend that is Moses discover who he is and what his destiny is. I started watching this movie as I watch most movies: while on the computer, eating lunch, distracted by a million different things. As soon as the first scene opened, I forgot to continue eating. My computer went idle. All of my attention, for once, was fixated on this beautiful masterpiece that is the Prince of Egypt. The soundtrack for this movie is heart-breaking, and the bittersweet ending sent tears down my cheeks. Every scene in this movie is riveting, crafted by passionate emotion and faith. I had not seen this movie since I was a young child, and did not expect to like it: after all, I'm not particularly compelled by movies solely based on religious matters. But this movie is not about a particular religion, as I thought it would be, but solely the act of Believing in something, and in Trust, and Beauty, and Love, and most of all, in Freedom.

My oldest (7) has a great interest in Egypt and history so I thought perhaps she would enjoy this. I gave the kids a background on the Moses story beforehand, but still they were absolutely horrified at the dream Moses has where they kill the mothers and take the babies away (they kept asking if the babies were killed and I said ""No, of course not""). We stopped the movie and they were in tears all throughout bedtime. Not worth it at all, no matter what your religious beliefs.

341,Wman1996,An under-appreciated classic.,10,26 July 2012,"It's amazing, really. Dreamworks has made so many animated films, and everyone seems to forget The Prince of Egypt.It's probably because the film is one of the most daring animated films out there. It's heavily religious, it has slavery, death, and no cute sidekicks.It doesn't need many clichés, and that's what makes it excellent.The animation is unrivaled. The parting of the Red Sea is one of the best moments in animation.The story is epic, though sometimes slow. Moses is fantastic. He goes from an arrogant prince to a wise, and respected leader of the Hebrews. The film also has hope as the central theme, whether you're religious or not.My favorite aspect is the music. Han Zimmer's score is beyond compare, and Stephen Schwartz's songs are all fantastic.If you have missed out on The Prince of Egypt, don't avoid it any longer, it's well worth your time.",The Prince of Egypt

I am a huge fan of Disney and Dreamworks but 99% of Hollywood versions of biblical or Egyptian history is poorly done. I am happy to say the end result is fantastic. Although I thought some of the actress choices were poor, the overall acting and singing is wonderful. The animation and artwork is beautifully done. If you go in with an open mind (and no religious biases), the story is lovely. It is appropriate for children five and older who would be able to understand some of the more dramatic points (the slaughter of innocent children). I thought the directors and screenplay writers really captured the story. There are moments I am brought to tears. There are powerful moments of spirituality (whether intended or not).

343,just-jackie-790-910905,Eye-Pleasing Propaganda,5,13 November 2010,"The Prince of Egypt is a well-animated Dreamworks film set in Ramses' I and Moses period of Ancient Egypt. Unfortunately, that is all this film has for itself. The film is interwoven with hypocrisy and poor musicals. Perhaps one of the most mind-numbing films of the late century, it is one film not worth a good word.Based upon the epic tale of Moses and how he freed 'his people' it appears to be a happy ending, ethical film. However as the film progresses you notice a few odd demeanours. Moses tries to free his own people yet, in the process, kills many innocents along the way. Moses' God brings wrath among the people for not freeing Moses. Raining fire and brimstone, animal plagues and what-not. Perhaps it hadn't occurred to the makers that they were being the slight bit hypocritical. Behind the harsh treatment of the slaves was the other side of the glass, where the innocent people of Ramses were ruthlessly hurt emphasized EVEN MORE by the quivering child and her mother as their people were laid to death. Moses also blames Ramses for this, however it was almost-definitely his fault for bringing it on the people... Since when did the person being provoked get the right to murder? Throughout the film you will hear ear-bleeding snippets of 'music'. The contraptions that they set out for the viewer to hear simply are terrible. They lack rhythm with repetitive lyrics and, as difficult as it sounds(pun intended), it will make you want to bash at the screen with a cobra-on-a-stick.It is clear that in the film they try to keep the good word in for Moses as killing innocent civilians and soldiers in an inverted tsunami is apparently proper etiquette. This is not aided by the fact that Moses and his people has to walk for forty days and forty nights without proper supplies or water. If treks in Ancient Egypt's desert tells us anything it is that you lose a lot of people that way, such as fifty-thousand soldiers lead by Cambyses.Despite all the terrible mind-numbingly tedious motions of this film there is a single good point which I shall sweep across. There is good animation, each shot seems well positioned well enough to see the terror in the face of civilians. Although on a high point, it doesn't bring this film from the trenches although it does lift it upon a fire-step of '5' (out of 10) only to be shot down by everything else.The Prince of Egypt is as difficult to review as to watch, every word brings horrid images of hypocrisy and gargantuan plot holes into perspective. Ultimately this film is altered by preference, and if you are a die-hard fan of the New Testament then by all means watch it. However, if you are not and feel that this film will better your knowledge of other cultures then stay half a sea from this 'movie'.",The Prince of Egypt
344,Adamsiki,The Prince of Egypt - a truly biblical story - destroying Disney's rep in the process,10,3 September 2010,"The film itself: The Prince of Egypt is a animation in which is created with the older style drawing in which we've seen in many cartoons. This is an advantage because nowadays animation films (Disney) use a more fancy and realistic style of animation which in turn leads you to believe the film is good when actually, the story could be pretty awful. Though there are some exceptions in my opinion (toy story, monsters inc. etc.). This old style seriously complements the sub- genre of the film and portrays the story itself very well.The Message and meaning: (possible spoilers) This story is an alternate to the religious story of Moses when he is tasked by God to free the Hebrew (Jewish) slaves of the Pharaohs of Egypt of that time. This story is truly biblical in the sense that it could evermore reinforce what (unfortunate) little faith i have which can admittedly be said to have been destroyed by the 21st century's lack of tradition, respect and overly selfish views on how the world should be run. So in short this film made me feel fantastic that i have any faith inside me. Even though I'm not bound to one religion and honestly only 16yrs old i feel its necissary for me to say that this film could not have been mustered from an imagination which isn't crafted by God himself (itself).The verdict: Awesome visual take - Lovely musical interjections - Beautiful acting - Honestly mind blowing religious message - AND - (if with faith) a nice little reminder of how God works for good and in mysterious ways.Thank you - Adam - 16yr old ""religiounless"" believer - lol",The Prince of Egypt
345,Care-Bear-Girl,Best Animated Film of all Time.,10,3 September 2003,"This has to be the best animated film of all time. All too often you will see a cartoon (apparently made for children) with all sorts of inappropriate innuendos...I loved this movie, partly because of the excellent animation, music, script, et cetera...but also because I felt it was a wonderful teaching tool for children. What a great way to get them interested in the Bible!I gave it a 10/10.",The Prince of Egypt
346,charlie-real-118-851242,Amazing,10,11 February 2019,"I'm not religious, but i still love every bit of this beautiful, moving film. The music, voices, story. I was obsessed with it as a child and even now, almost 30 years old it still stands as one of my favorite movies.",The Prince of Egypt
347,keagan764,"A tale of two brothers, of enslaved people and amazing visuals whats not to like",7,20 February 2013,Dreamworks animation really hit the ball on this animated feature. I saw this film when I was a young child and recently watched it again before writing this review and honestly it is a 9/10 in terms of animated movies.The characters are really good because of a mix of good voice acting and am amazing musical score to well portray the situation and the personal struggle of the protagonist Moses. This film has been compared to the 1956 classic The Ten Commandments and in a lot of ways it does itself a huge favor by giving a different perspective on the characters. This had some stunning visuals for the time still manages to impress even by today's standards granted that the film was not made that long ago but a lot of lesser visual animations are still made to this day. This is complimented by an amazing compilation done by many composers such as Hans Zimmer who added to amazing tracks that really shine in the movie.The movie is a little more adult for a children's not the sense of violence or adultery but more the themes such as slavery and religion which should be considered since it is a story about the Jewish diaspora. What really manages to captivate you is the relationship between Moses and his brother a really tragic take both characters that are almost non identical to there counterparts in the film the 10 commandments.The plot is predictable but it is based on a very widely known story so the fun in this movie is seeing how the animators and writers put a twist in the storytelling aspect.In conclusion this is a amazing animation very underrated although it is not quite for everyone but if enjoy a great and well told story with kick*** animation and awesome characters this is the movie for you a solid 7.9/10 for a movie and a 9/10 for an animated movie,The Prince of Egypt
348,ali_harkouss,Atheist but always astonished by this masterpiece,10,14 November 2018,"Let's forget for a while religions and conflicts between humans. Let's focus on the huge amount of creativity and greatness that made this masterpiece. Although DreamWorks have imitated Disney on different levels but the result surprised all those who watched it. The title itself implies that a great story took place in an old great civilization.
In my opinion, the story of this movie is not like what most of people think: conflict between good and bad. It's way beyond that. It's a story of two real brothers who love each other to the core but they were obliged to become enemies due to their differences in beliefs and religion. Don't you think that it's time for people to forget about their differences and become compassionate and empathetic? Love will unite us while religions make us enemies to each other.
The music was outstanding, as well as the songs. The soundtracks of this film make the spectator live in old Egypt which is a very genius innovation by the composer. Very few composers know how to connect their music with an epoch, land and a place.
The first scene when slaves were building the pyramids was one of the best starts in movies history.
Simply it's one of the best movies in history. It's a combination of greatness and beauty.",The Prince of Egypt
349,meiow16,Awesome movie!!!!,10,9 November 2004,"I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out. The Prince of Egypt was on t.v. the other night, and my children were able to watch it for the first time. My 6 year old was fascinated. He has a children's Bible that he pulled out and had read to him during the commercials to hear the story of Moses. This movie created a great moment for my family to have a serious discussion about Faith. The color and scenery of this movie is breath-taking. Absolutely beautiful.The characters are very detailed and well thought out, the voices suit the characters perfectly. Prince of Egypt really gets into the emotional aspect of Moses and Ramses. The one thing I did not agree on was the aging of Moses. He was 130 when he found the Promised Land, the movie does not age him at all. Other than that, the movie is one of my all time favorites and is a great way to start children on a journey of Faith.",The Prince of Egypt
350,harriotpotter,See above.,10,14 January 2005,"This has to be one of the best movies ever made. I've seen many movies of all different genres and this is definitely one of my favorites. The story is that of Moses from Exodus. It's really objective and there's no favoritism (except for the obvious the-Egyptians-are-the-bad-guys part). I guess you could call it a ""childrens movie"" but really it's not. I don't really think children would understand the ""deeper meaning"" as much. The music is nothing short of glorious. I'm a musician and Handel couldn't have come up with better choruses. The only song I'm not really fond of is ""You're playing with the big boys now"". Well, it's really good for the scene, but melody-wise, it's OK. Someone said the music was unnecessary, but I completely disagree. It adds so much to the movie and to the telling of the story. I absolutely adore The Prince of Egypt and if you're looking for an amazing animated movie, go with this one because you won't regret it.",The Prince of Egypt
351,ajitho,its a cool movie,10,19 January 2005,"The movie was very well done. Great graphics and the music and song were easy to follow and sing along with. I liked the movie, and more importantly my children liked the movie. The fact that a company other than Disney made an animated movie that did very well shows a lot of hard work. The story was easey to follow and my children learned a lot from the movie and asked more questions about Moses and the slaves and slavery. I am proud that a movie that talks about and depicts God in a positive way made it out to the public. Most movies now portray a lot of negative goals like selling drugs is cool, or being in a gang is cool. This movie would be enjoyed by every one from 3 years old to 93 years old. I hope the continue making more positive movies",The Prince of Egypt
352,bryonyalte,Moses is sent to deliver his people form Egypt.,10,4 February 2005,"I thought this movie was a fantastic rendition of the events that took place in the bible. Val Kilmer did a wonderful job as the voices of Moses and God. I was very impresses with Hotep and Hut. They really gave the story a darker side. The tenth plague was drawn so well, I fell in love with the movie immediately. My favorite part was when Moses saw the burning bush, and when he parted the Red Sea. It was all drawn so well, that you could automatically lose yourself in the movie, and not want it to end. I however did not like when Moses accidentally killed the guard on the structure. It was disappointing to know that Ramases thought he could make it all go away. (If you want the Lyrics to ""When You Believe,"" email bryonyalte@yahoo.com. I'll send them to you, Hebrew and all.)",The Prince of Egypt
353,Consume4JC,Prince of Egypt According to the Bible,5,25 April 2005,"When I first saw The Prince of Egypt, I was attached immediately. The power of the characters. The music was phenomenal! The only downfall in this movie is the storyline. It all starts out correctly and ends correctly, but almost everything in between is not accurate according to the Bible. If a person knows or read the story in Exodus, they will know. For a person like me, it drives us nuts. We know the story already, and while this movie is fantastic, it doesn't fit with the actual story.They say about 600 religious experts were conferred with to ""make the film as accurate as possible."" This is not true. Read the story of Moses and his path in the book of Exodus and watch the movie and there you will find many errors in the movie according to the Bible. Once Moses is separated from his mother to the point where the Hebrews cross the Red Sea, numerous events are incorrect. Watch carefully, after reading the story in the Bible, and see the scenes to which I'm referring. Another way to see the difference is by watching the Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston. Same story, but major difference in the events taking place.If a person doesn't really care about the storyline of the movie or what really happened they can disregard the false implications. The first time I saw the movie I didn't think anything of what really happened as told in the Bible.",The Prince of Egypt
354,yorkie297,Great Family Film,10,10 March 2018,This is a great family film and not just for Christians. It has great animation for the time it was made and amazing music!,The Prince of Egypt
355,emilyekoester,Incredible!,9,11 May 2014,"The Prince of Egypt is probably one of my favorite animated movies not made by Disney. (I'm sure that I'd prefer it to several Disney animations as well.) This film was very present in my childhood, and I always enjoyed watching it, but it wasn't until a few year ago when I saw it for the first time in a while (I'm 20 now) that it really hit me just how intense and awe-inspiriting the movie is! I found myself getting chills the whole way through, basically every time someone sang, and when any power of God was shown. That, I think, is what really got be and brought me to tears, was the awesome portrayal of God, who really isn't present in any animated film except for this one (and the later story of Joseph). The Hunchback of Notre Dame also spotlights Christianity, but focuses more of hypocrisy and prejudice in the church than it does on God Himself. And, obviously, it's the story of Moses. You really can't go wrong there, as long as you actually follow the Bible. The movie did a great job in staying relatively accurate. Sure, there was some creative license taken, but the main premise of Exodus stayed the same. This is an incredible film!",The Prince of Egypt
356,traceybabe15,I adore this movie,9,21 September 2005,"I adore the Prince of Egypt. Such a stellar cast of voices, and the names don't outweigh the movie. The music is fantastic. It has such a diverse audience, you cannot go wrong with this film. We are all familiar with the base story and we are provided a mild, interpretive, inoffensive version to intrigue and open the mind. If not, it can be enjoyed simply for the color, sound, and simple human emotions and actions that glide over right and wrong. I'm in college, and I listen to this movie while studying. I can't escape, humming in the shower, and learning calculus to the goose-bump inducing tones. The sounds of God capture all emotion and awe.",The Prince of Egypt
357,vislav-horvat,Average,3,30 December 2019,"Average but solid for a fantasy animated movie.
My biggest problem with the story is god's cruelty towards the innocent. He kills the children instead enabling Jews to escape without the bloodshed.
Also when Egyptians were killing jewish children he didn't do anything and then he wanted revenge and acted the same way. Not much more to add.",The Prince of Egypt
358,dwfee,Underrated movie with an amazing soundtrack,10,21 April 2020,"A beautifully constructed movie about the story of Moses and his freeing the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt. Yes, the movie has religious undertones, but it is conveyed in a way that is accessible to all regardless of belief. The main plot lies in the conflict Moses faces when he is tasked with freeing the Hebrews from slavery, but to do this must face off with his brother (the pharaoh) whom he loved growing up. I would argue that the soundtrack is one of the best of any animated movie. ""When You Believe"", ""Through Heaven's Eye's"", and ""Deliver Us"" are all amazing.",The Prince of Egypt
359,blue_sea_water,This movie is so moving,10,25 July 2005,"I was in tears and all emotional when I watched this movie. It's not a movie only for Christian people to watch, I think this movie's for anyone and I definitely recommend it. I used a whole box of my Kleenex and my eyes were so red by the end of the movie I freaked out myself. Honestly, people should make more movies like this, because nowadays, it's all movies like where you forget what the movie is really about. And then couple of months later, you don't even remember if you watched the movie or not. I don't think that really makes sense there. But anyway this movie is really good! I've got the soundtrack and it's really really good, watch the movie !!!",The Prince of Egypt
360,p-63910,"An Egyptian prince discovers his true identity as a Hebrew, and becomes the chosen deliverer to lead his people to their promised land.",8,7 December 2015,"The Prince of Egypt directed by Simon Wells, Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and produced by DreamWorks Pictures is an engaging animated film adaptation of the Book of Exodus from the First Testament of the Bible. It provides an accurate portrayal of the story of Moses leading his people to freedom from Egypt, mixed with original songs and compositions that help compliment the theme of the film. While the length of the film may be too long to hold a child's attention, it's still a thrilling, beautiful piece of work. It chooses to focus on Moses's family relationships, and how he is torn between the life he always knew as an Egyptian prince and his true roots as an Israelite. The film also adds in the familiar sibling rivalry theme between Moses and his Egyptian brother, Rameses II, allowing the audience to find a sense of reliability in it, and to form an connection to the characters. The music was stunning and beautiful to listen to, and the added Hebrew lyrics in certain songs create a sense of authenticity in the film. While there was a certain song during Moses's return to Egypt that I felt was not necessary, and almost forced into the film, DreamWorks still managed to put together an amazing musical film adaptation of the Exodus story. The directors also chose to have a named pharaoh, in contrast to the Bible where the pharaoh is unknown, and to have said pharaoh have a direct connection to Moses in order to create a more dramatic setting when Moses realizes the full extent of what the Egyptians have done to his people. The film also chose to have Moses in the dark when it comes to his true identity unlike the Bible, which also added to the drama in the revelation. The film keeps some quotes from the actual Exodus chapter, including ""I AM WHO I AM"" (Exodus 3:14) and ""Let my people go"" (Exodus 5:1), along with ""Who has made man's mouth? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I?"" (Exodus 4:11), but left out the second half of the Exodus, after Moses and his people flee Egypt, choosing to end the film directly after Moses receives the 10 Commandments. While much of the important historical context is within the second half, it did make sense for the directors to omit it as it is most likely not suitable for children and difficult to condense. The film took a careful approach when it came to creating a portrayal of God. Instead of giving him a powerful, booming voice like most people might imagine, his voice came out as a soft whisper that radiated power and authority. This is just one example of how DreamWorks attempted to give a careful, accurate story while trying not to offend anybody. It also made the Hebrew people much more hopeful and faithful than they were in the actual Bible in order to make it more suitable for children. The film also decided to have Moses speak for himself instead of his Hebrew brother Aaron in the Bible, giving more focus on Moses's transformation into the leader he was born to be. Overall The Prince of Egypt is an excellent, accurate, easy to understand film telling the story of Moses, incorporating messages such as having faith in the future and looking at your life 'through heaven's eyes,' as nobody can measure someone's worth. The way DreamWorks chose to create these messages, through engaging songs, is a clever way to help the child audience fully understand them. The Prince of Egypt in general is a careful, detailed film and a clever way to help children understand the general concept of the Exodus story.",The Prince of Egypt
361,seiliez,Pretty spiffy.,9,7 December 2006,"I've seen this movie plenty of times, and I've never gotten sick of it. I enjoy watching this movie, not because of it's religious background, but simply because it was done well, and has an amazing soundtrack. Besides religion, I see no reason why other people would not also enjoy this movie. I know lots of other people who have seen this movie and also enjoy watching it, including adults and children of all ages. I think reasons this movie would be appealing to people interested in religious films, especially children's, or musicals, or even just good movies in general. It's just as good a watch as a classic Disney movie, and probably better than a lot of the newer ones they're coming out with. I applaud Dreamworks for this.",The Prince of Egypt
362,tipan_jag,Pure art,9,9 March 2017,"I watched this movie about a million times when I was younger. Partly because I was a kid and partly because it was just spectacular to look at.The animation, the environments and just the general style is breathtaking. It is so well executed and spectacular that I seriously cannot praise it enough. As it goes hand in hand with the music it just becomes this fantastic melting pot of art. This isn't the average Disney hot-shot, this is more then that. Astounding music with a thick orchestra, on point voice-acting and I would actually say that it is very respectful of the ""source material"" so to speak.The only reason I am not giving it a 10 is that I am more for live- action. Not saying this would get a 10 just because of that but that I feel it could've been longer and more explaining. But that is pretty much my only complaint.",The Prince of Egypt
363,amtiley,Extraordinary,10,19 May 2017,"Most incredible movie with great graphics and story line, let alone those beautiful songs! Always have loved this story from the Bible and this broadened my adoring for it immensely. Love all the scenes from this movie and how they tug at your heart, such as Moses leaving then returning to his brother Ramses or meeting his biological siblings Miriam and Aaron once again. Everything was wonderful. Fantastic work Dreamworks.",The Prince of Egypt
