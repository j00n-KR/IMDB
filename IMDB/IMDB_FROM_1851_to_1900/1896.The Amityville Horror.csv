0,Leofwine_draca,A rare beast - a superior remake,7,17 March 2015,"Another year, another remake. At least THE AMITYVILLE HORROR remake has some sense behind it: the '70s version is very much a flawed film, one I found interesting and engaging, but not particularly well made or paced. This one sticks very much to Jay Anson's book as its source material, attempting to show a realistic sequence of events centred around a real-life haunted house. For the most part, I liked it a lot. It's an exercise in atmosphere building, relying on suspense over gore, eerie chills over shocks, and it's these elements of the movie that lift it far above the norm.Of course, being a Hollywood movie, there has to be more, so we get thrown-in chase scenes across rooftops, a villain who keeps coming back from the dead, a hint at a SAW-style gore sequence in which a woman's hair is caught in a boat's propeller, some unnecessary and flashy MTV-style editing and the presence of a creepy young ghost girl who doesn't really add much to the proceedings. There's also an extended flashback that attempts to explain the house's haunted reputation, it's something to do with Native Americans being tortured in the basement back in the 17th century, apparently.To be honest I found all of this stuff quite superfluous. The central plot of the film concerns George Lutz's character, showing how the house slowly changes his personality as he becomes 'possessed' by the evil therein. THIS is the stuff that's scary, not that flashy stuff. When I heard that Ryan Reynolds was cast in this movie, I despaired, because I hated him in BLADE: TRINITY and he's always seemed to be one of those big-headed, can't-take-anything-seriously type of actors. Well, this film is an exception, because he's GREAT in it. I found him sympathetic and scary at the same time, and I thought he did a great job of portraying how George's mind was gradually transformed. Good job on the contact lenses, too. Basically, every scene with Reynolds is a highlight in this movie. The rest of the cast don't have a great deal to work with, particularly Melissa George (30 DAYS OF NIGHT), who always seems to suffer in thankless roles in horror films. The kids shriek a lot, but Jesse James has the second strongest part as the slightly older boy who suspects that his stepfather might be hiding something.For the most part, I found this a definite improvement over the original. Some of the scenes are mishandled and disappointing as a result – the scene with the priest and the flies is nowhere near as disturbing as I found it in the original – but for the most part this is taut, psychological horror fare and a cut above Hollywood's usual remake standards.",The Amityville Horror
1,SnoopyStyle,Creepiest thing is the sexy babysitter,5,26 October 2013,"The Lutz family (Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett, Chloë Grace Moretz) finds a big house for a surprising price. The reason for the low price is a grisly murder suicide in its history. When the family moves in, strange things start happening.The biggest mistake is using the wrong POV. Ryan Reynolds shouldn't be the one to lead the movie. Melissa George should be the lead. She can be afraid of Reynolds. She can be conflicted about the new man as a father for her children. There are all kinds of avenues this could have taken.The creepiest thing that happened is the super sexy babysitter (Rachel Nichols) for the kids. Would any parents really just walk off without a second look when the babysitter is dressed like that? And it gets super awkward with the sex talk.",The Amityville Horror
2,claudio_carvalho,"Spooky, But Absolutely Unnecessary",6,27 April 2006,"I do not like remakes, but I love horror movies, so that was the reason for me to see this remake of the 1979 ""The Amityville Horror"" on DVD. The movie is spooky, because the original story is scary. ""The Amityville Horror"" was released in 1979, and has the great merit of being made before ""The Shining""(1980) and ""Poltergeist"" (1982), which seem to use parts of the storyline of this film. But this remake is absolutely unnecessary, since it is the same story, once it is claimed to be based on a true event, and in the same year, 1974. Therefore, there is nothing new or original in this remake, with the exception of the actors and actresses and some special effects. Ryan Reynolds visibly looked for inspiration watching Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shinning"", with the insane expression of Jack Nicholson and an ax in his hands chasing his family. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Horror em Amityville"" (""Horror in Amityville"")",The Amityville Horror
3,gavin6942,"Nothing New, But Hardly a Bad Picture",6,3 January 2007,"A year after the DeFeo family is slaughtered wholesale by a rifle-loving father, a new family -- the Lutzes -- move in. Soon, the family feels an eerie presence in the house and George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) -- the new dad -- begins to change.The movie overall is a respectable one. The mood is very nice, the New York Times rightfully called it ""a modest improvement over the original"", and I freely admit there were moments I was on edge thinking something nasty was going to come popping out, a feeling I very rarely have anymore after seeing so many ""scary movies"". So all in all they did something right. One scene in particular, where something is in the ceiling (I couldn't quite make it out) was creepy, and the dead girl in the window was unsettling. I also take a little pride knowing the film was shot in Wisconsin (in the towns of Salem and Silver Lake, near Kenosha).Someone commented that this was very much a Ryan Reynolds fetish film, having him taking up almost all the scenes. More specifically, it's a Ryan Reynolds chopping wood fetish film. He is in 85% of the shots and in many of those he is chopping wood. And why is his shirt constantly off? Yes, I see those pecs and abs, Ryan... I know you were in that ""Blade"" movie... but come on, you were also in ""Van Wilder""... you're not a threat.Melissa George (Kathy Lutz) on the other hand did not take her shirt off enough, and when she did the camera was positioned in such convenient ways. Was this film PG-13? I don't believe it was, so why tease the audience like that? By the way, George's performance was the weakest of the entire cast, even the children. Some people have commented on how she is a TV actress, and I agree this might have something to do with it. (For a better Melissa George film, see ""Triangle"".)Another reviewer complained that Kathy didn't remove her children fast enough when George began turning violent. I disagree. The family has been together a while, George has been nothing but loving and supportive (I mean, geez, he bought her a house). The whole film takes place in about a week, as far as I can tell. The man deserves a few days of blowing off steam.What's the deal with the babysitter (Rachel Nichols)? She shows up looking like a prostitute and then talks seductively to a little boy. This was very confusing for me. I don't mind... and actually, I really liked her character, but it was still odd.My friend warned me about the babysitter in the closet scene, which he said was the creepiest thing he saw since ""In the Mouth of Madness"". Well, I think ITMOM was John Carpenter's best film (even more than ""The Thing"", ""They Live"" and ""Prince of Darkness"") but it never scared me. The closet scene had me on edge -- but only because he had me convinced it was going to be awful. Really, the scene was nothing out of the ordinary. (You'll have to see for yourself what happens, maybe you'll be grossed out more than I was.) There were many ""Wicked Little Things"" connections, which is a slam on WLT. If you read my review for that film, you'll see I complained about how unoriginal it was. After seeing ""Amityville Horror"", I can add so many more instances. Both films star Chloe Moretz (the Dakota Fanning of horror). Both have her with an ""imaginary friend"" that is a dead girl. Both inform their mothers they won't be hurt. Both carry disfigured dolls previously owned by the dead friend. So, um, for the guys who made ""Wicked Little Things"" -- if you were gonna rip off ""Amityville Horror"", why didn't you at least bother to get a new actress? The producers do say on the commentary that ""she was amazing"" and I appreciate that Chloe was singled out.I didn't expect much from this one, hearing it was nothing special and many saying it was monotonous. Well, I liked it. I think it all went together very well, and they do a fine job of explaining the backstory, which is something many horror films fail miserably at. (I don't recall if the original explains it as well, but I'm willing to bet it doesn't). By remake standards, better than average. By movie standards, not bad. I stamp it with my seal of approval.",The Amityville Horror
4,jboothmillard,The Amityville Horror,3,1 November 2010,"The original film with James Brolin and Margot Kidder is rated two stars, but I noticed this remake was exactly the same rating, so I thought it would be interesting to see which one I'd prefer. If you don't know the plot already, basically the Lutz family, husband/father George (Just Friends' Ryan Reynolds) and wife/mother Kathy (30 Days of Night's Melissa George) and their kids Billy (Jesse James), Michael (Jimmy Bennett) and Chelsea (Chloë Grace Moretz) are moving house. They find what they believe to be the perfect family home in The Amityville Horror for a bit of a low price, and this is revealed to be because there was a mass murder in the house a few years ago. Not long after moving a few strange things start happening, starting with George developing temper tantrums and blowing his fuse quite easily. But also daughter Chelsea seems to have an invisible friend named Jodie Defeo (Isabel Conner), who is revealed to be a once real and living person from the past. Then the really bad stuff comes about when demons are showing up and the house is speaking to George telling him to kill his family, and making one or two of the kids being almost possessed. Kathy tries to get some help from Father Callaway (Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall) to perform an exorcism or something, realising where they are living, but he runs away in fear with a demonic attack. Eventually George really comes out with his extremely aggressive side brought out by the haunted house when he tries to kill Kathy and the kids, and they realise they have to get him away from the house in the speedboat (unlike the car). Also starring Rachel Nichols as Lisa, Brendan Donaldson as Ronald Defeo and Annabel Armour as Realtor. This version focuses more on the father going insane kind of like Jack Torrance and less on the house coming alive, so the original version is much creepier than this not very impressive supernatural horror remake. Adequate!",The Amityville Horror
5,ma-cortes,New version Amityville with lots of screams and weird deeds,6,12 June 2006,"A family(Ryan Reynolds,Melissa George and sons)moves to Long Island where is purchased a Victorian home ,their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror.Longtime ago,there occurred a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville. And now a possessed father is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat the kiddies.He is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar.Meanwhile a exorcist(Philip Baker Hall)tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit.The film contains restless terror and great loads of gore and blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse as pipes and wall ooze stuff,flies swarm,doors suddenly slam ;it is recreated with high grade special effects which are frightening and horrifying the spectator.It's actually halfway decent terror movie that will like to ghostly and eerie occur fonds. The original¨Exorcist¨film(Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possessions movies that continues unabated today ¨Changeling¨,¨Amytiville ¨(Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre ,following a great number of sequels directed by Damiano Damiani,Richard Fleischer,Sandor Stern(authentic film's screenwriter),Anthony Hitchcock... .Although this is a new version from previous film, it's one of the highest earning horror movie of the last years.The motion picture is well directed by Andrew Douglas",The Amityville Horror
6,BA_Harrison,Reasonable remake of the creepy classic!,7,12 May 2006,"This unnecessary, but effective remake manages to take a well known tale and retell it in an imaginative and surprisingly spooky manner.When the Lutz family move into the most infamous house in horror movie history, they soon realise that the property wasn't such a bargain after all; the scene of a mass shooting the previous year, the building is not exactly a des-res. It's not long before stepfather George (Ryan Reynolds) becomes possessed and mother Kathy (Melissa George) and her kids are running for their lives.Thankfully, director Andrew Douglas does not give us a carbon copy of the 1979 movie; he embellishes the original plot, adding creepy new elements, including a nifty background story about the origins of the house. The chills are well developed and the shocks, though rather mechanical in execution, are timed to perfection (although the final 'shock' is an out and out cheat and should have been cut from the film).Whilst not exactly essential viewing, The Amityville Horror is a lot better than I thought it would be and is well worth a watch.",The Amityville Horror
7,moonspinner55,"Big budget blunder...wayward, confusing, and awesomely extended",2,21 February 2010,"A construction worker, his new wife and three stepchildren move into a spooky New York estate, one with a disturbing past: the previous tenants were murdered while they slept by the ""possessed"" eldest son. A rather loose adaptation of Jay Anson's bestseller about the Lutz family's ""true-life"" experiences, first filmed in 1979, hopes to explain that what overtook the original murderer is now possessing patriarch George Lutz. Unfortunately, screenwriter Scott Kosar's explanation--in which he points the finger at a vicious killer of Indians named Jeremiah Ketchum--is sketchily-presented at best, confusing at worst (Mrs. Lutz reads about it at the library in the same moment her husband is discovering the atrocities in a wall behind the boathouse). Kosar wants multiple-layer horrors, while director Andrew Douglas is more than happy to pile on the shuddery images (often used as cheap-shock nightmares: ""Oh, it was only a dream!""). The film is so woefully overproduced with all the latest whiz-bang tricks the narrative flattens out, so that even the scariest portion of the story--the intrinsic fear of one's own parent--nearly becomes arbitrary, an afterthought. In the lead, Ryan Reynolds was probably cast for his handsome physique and six-pack, but this isn't appropriate for the character (George Lutz as an axe-wielding sex symbol). Reynolds does manage a tight performance, nevertheless, while the other actors are reduced to crying, worrying, trembling victims who continually run for cover. Most logical people run from a bomb. * from ****",The Amityville Horror
8,wes-connors,The House That Dripped Money,3,16 September 2010,"""From Michael Bay, the producer of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', comes the true story of Amityville. In November 1974, a family of six was brutally murdered. Now, a year later, an unsuspecting young couple, George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), and their children move into the house that was the site of the horrific event and is now haunted by a murderous presence. What follows is 28 days of unimaginable terror. With demonic visions of the dead and relentless screams of terror, this is the haunted house story that isn't just a movie - it's real,"" according to the film's official description.Writer Jay Anson along with ""The Amityville Horror"" house residents George and Kathleen Lutz essentially made up this story, which was a media sensation even before the first movie appeared in 1979.""Based on the true story,"" all of this was supposed to be about a ""real"" haunted house, with ghosts possibly vengeful due to desecration of sacred Indian burial grounds. Apparently, some religions share the same devil. Gullible people gobbled up the ghoulishness revealed in the original book and movie. It may also be a tribute to the storytellers' imagination that ""The Amityville Horror"" continues to be taken seriously. This re-make bears mysteriously little resemblance to the original story, however; the flies are sorely underused. Admirers of the male physique will appreciate a generous sampling of Mr. Reynolds' killer body.*** The Amityville Horror (4/7/05) Andrew Douglas ~ Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George, Jesse James, Jimmy Bennett",The Amityville Horror
9,BandSAboutMovies,Poor,4,14 February 2020,"The only thing I could recall about seeing this in the theater is that one of my friends is the toughest wrestler I've ever met and he continually lept to his feet at every single jump scare.Years of the Amityville films being direct to video didn't stop Michael Bay, MGM and Dimension Films with charging Andrew Douglas with directing this remake. He's since gone on to helm episodes of Netflix's Mindhunter.For what it's worth, the studios claimed that the remake was based on new information uncovered during the research of the original story, but George Lutz claimed that nobody ever spoke to him or his family about the project. His attorney contacted the studios to express the thought that they didn't have the right to proceed without his input. The case remained unresolved when Lutz died in May 2006. Man, the only thing scarier than the devil is our legal system.Instead of James Brolin and Margot Kidder, here we have a pre-Deadpool Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George. As for the kids, Jesse James plays Billy (no, not the outlaw nor the tattooed mechanic), Jimmy Bennett (the young Kirk from the modern Star Trek) is Michael and Chloë Grace Moretz is Chelsea. Phillip Baker Hall, who of course deserves better, plays a priest. And Rachel Nichols, who was Scarlett in G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra plays the babysitter.The new research is all about the fact that the house once belonged to a preacher named Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham, who killed plenty of Native Americans which caused the hauntings here at 112 Ocean Avenue. So yes, they set out to remake The Amityville Horror and made a turn into Poltergeist.I love the Hollywood BS factory that spun stories that a dead fisherman washed up near the set, that Kathy Lutz died while they were filming and the fact that cast and crew members began waking up at 3:15 AM - the same time that Ron Defeo Jr. murdered his family. It gets so ridiculous that in 2008, Melissa George told Celebrity Ghost Stories that the terror she showed in the movie was real and that she was really being haunted.",The Amityville Horror
10,Coventry,Inspired by a true nonsense-story.,2,11 March 2006,"There are different types of remakes nowadays, but they're practically all redundant. Classic horror films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Psycho"" didn't require a remake because they were already brilliant and not dated at all, whereas ""The Amityville Horror"" didn't deserve a remake because the original screenplay already was rubbish and totally uninteresting when it first came out. This is a very unnecessary and dreadful film that surely ranks among the bottom-worst movies of the year 2005. Once again, Jay Anson's novel (which is supposedly based on factual events) supplies the story of a young family that moves into a giant Long Island house that has the reputation of being haunted. The oldest son of the previous residents slaughtered his entire family because the voices of the house commanded him so and, within the first 28 days, new man of the house George Lutz will do the same to his family... They should have just called this movie ""Amityville"", as there certainly isn't any horror involved. Sure, there are a lot of creaky windows, slamming doors and weird unnatural noises but those are all simply false scares and lame red herrings. Andrew Douglas' directing is truly uninspired and he can't even bring an experienced actor like Philip Baker Hall to deliver a good performance. There are so many other things wrong with this film, I can't even begin to list them: a lack of sets and locations (those kids didn't leave the house once?), no humor (unless you consider a slutty babysitter upsetting children to be funny), totally no 70's feel to it and an endless list of story-elements that are stolen from unrelated films (""The Shining"", ""Ju-On The Grudge"", ""Dream Warriors"", ""The Exorcist""...). Melissa George is a vast improvement over Margot Kidder, but how can this stunning beauty possibly have a 12-year-old son already? She hardly looks 22 herself. And where does that entirely new historical background of the house comes from all of a sudden? If Douglas did have the ambition to alter the original plot, why not pay any attention to continuity or timing? Why the hell am I still wasting time on this terrible film-experience? Bah!",The Amityville Horror
11,michaelRokeefe,Quality family time gets harder and harder to find.,6,14 October 2005,"A lot of remakes deserve to be forgotten; but this version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR may just be scarier than the 1979 original starring James Brolin, Margo Kidder and Rod Steiger. I found myself flinching more this time. Real good photography and some pretty intense scenes. In November of 1974, the Defeo residence in Amityville, Long Island was the sight of a nightmarish crime scene. Ronald Defeo(Brendan Donaldson)confessed to the brutal slaughter of his parents and four siblings in their sleep, claiming that ""voices"" told him to carry out the grisly carnage. Now that time has gone by and the community has tried to put the past in the past...the Defeo house is for sale and George(Ryan Reynolds)and Kathy(Melissa George)Lutz and their three children move into what was thought to be their dream house. No sooner than the family can get settled in, unexplainable bizarre events begin occurring. George falls victim to haunting voices and nightmarish visions. The family seems caught up in a devilish whirlwind and fear for their lives. 28 days after moving in, the Lutzes abandon their residence in Hell and feel lucky to be alive. Andrew Douglas directs the Scott Kosar screenplay based on Jay Anson's novel. Also in the cast: Jimmy Bennett, Chloe Moretz, Philip Baker Hall and Annabel Armour.",The Amityville Horror
12,preppy-3,As bad as the first...but in different ways,1,17 April 2005,"In 1974 Ron DeFeo killed his whole family (mother, father, 2 brothers and a sister) because (he said) voices told him to. A year later the Lutz family moved in. 28 days later they fled saying the place was evil. We all know now it was a hoax.The 1979 version of this was horrible. Dull, stupid and didn't even bother to follow the book. The only good thing about it was Margot Kidder's performance. I had high hopes for this--Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz) is a good actor and they SAID they were going to follow the book. Well...they didn't and gave us ANOTHER lousy film version of this. What's wrong with this? Let me count the ways: 1) They have ghosts appearing all over the place--and CONSTANTLY in shock cuts with loud, blaring music. These are called ""jump scenes"". Unfortunately there are WAY too many of them in this movie. Instead of scaring you they quickly become annoying. 2) Hiring talented actor Ryan Reynolds...and give him NOTHING to work with. He's good but the poor guy is obviously struggling to bring something to the role. 3) The three kids are constantly being put in danger. Once or twice I can see but it happens almost nonstop. By the end I got the disturbing feeling that the filmmakers were enjoying it! 4) The ""red room"" in the basement is gone and the house is given a real stupid back story. 5) Actress Melissa George (as Kathy Lutz) is way too weepy and whiny. 6) An animal is axed to death (it's shown). 7) The kids are VERY annoying. 8) Despite all the blood, thunder and ghosts this movie is very dull. I just sat there patiently waiting for it to get over.It's boring, stupid and very annoying. Hard to believe that a film this loud is dull...but it is. The only good parts for me were seeing Reynolds (all handsome and pumped up) with his shirt off.Both this and the 1979 version are wastes of time. Avoid. Read the book instead.",The Amityville Horror
13,poolandrews,Much better than I had expected & an improvement on the original.,7,27 May 2008,"The Amityville Horror starts late one night on the 13th November 1973 in the small Long Island town of Amityville where a crazed man named Ronald DeFeo (Brendan Donaldson) brutally murders his entire family while they sleep... Jump forward one year later & happily married couple George (Ryan Reynolds) & Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) buy the Defeo's large house, it being very cheap after standing empty for a year because of it's notorious past. Together with their three young children George & Kathy move in & at first think they have found their dream home, however the dream quickly turns into a nightmare as they discover to their cost that their wonderful new home is haunted by an evil Reverend who liked a bit of torture & murder....Directed by Andrew Douglas this was a remake of the original The Amityville Horror (1979) which in itself isn't a particularly good film, in fact the general consensus is that it's a vastly overrated film so I wasn't going into this Hollywood remake with any great expectation but I have to admit I really rather liked The Amityville Horror '05. The script by Scott Kosar bases itself more upon the earlier film than the novel by Jay Anson, in fact it keeps some of the more famous moments from the original like the Father being attacked by fly's which weren't in the book & even adds some scenes of it's own which are neither in the original film or book like George killing the family dog, a dizzying but unlikely scene where the young daughter takes a walk on the roof & the new back-story about the evil Reverend who committed suicide after torturing & killing Indians. I think all these additions make for a much better, deeper & more incident packed film. The original '79 The Amityville Horror was a pretty drab & lifeless affair that ran for almost two hours while the remake is a really pacey fast moving supernatural haunted house horror thriller that runs for a much more manageable ninety minutes. I liked the character's here too, George's descent into madness, the kids dislike of George adds some nice tension & the desperate Kathy who tries to keep the family together are all well fleshed out, written & developed. Much better than I had expected on all fronts really & certainly an improvement on the vastly overrated & dull original.Director Douglas keeps things moving along at a good pace & he uses every cheap jump tactic in the book but most of his shocks work very well & in my opinion this is a much more atmospheric, scary & sinister film than the original. The film is well made with some nice cinematography & unusually I didn't notice too much CGI either, there are moments but it's not like every other scene has CGI because it doesn't no matter what anyone says. There's some blood & gore but nothing too graphic, there's some blood splatter, some crime scene photos, someone hanging on hooks, someone with the skin on their back sliced off, a slit throat & some bloody gunshot wounds. A lot of people seem dead against remakes but most of the Hollywood ones have been rather good like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), Dawn of the Dead (2004), The Grudge (2004), The Hills Have Eyes (2006) & Black Christmas (2006) amongst those I have time for.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 this was quite a well funded remake & it show's with very good production values & that Hollywood polish about it. Apparently The Amityville Horror was the last film released under the roaring Lion of MGM which was brought out by several other companies shortly after. Although set in Long Island the film was shot largely in Illinois. The acting was good, Ryan Reynolds in particular while Melissa George is easy on the eyes & although she looks too young to have three children she was actually thirty when she shot the film.The Amityville Horror exceeded all my expectation & I have to say I really liked it, I am sure there are loads of people out there who won't because it's a remake but they can bugger off. I liked it & it's as simple & straight forward as that.",The Amityville Horror
14,dbborroughs,Easily the Best Amityville Film,7,28 May 2005,"Its hard for me to review this film objectively. I'm old enough to have been alive to have a vague recollection of the original murders. I have lived not far from the real house my whole life and the tales have been a part of my life for good and bad for the last thirty years. As an accurate portrait of what supposedly happened in Amityville in the mid 1970's its so far off the mark as to be a joke. I kept a running commentary with myself about how pointless calling the film the Amityville anything was. (Then again aside from the murders everything that happened was probably made up) Still as a horror film I quite liked the movie. In all honesty I'm convinced that had the film not been connected to the Amityville story this would have been a better received film. Its a very creepy little movie that operates nicely in its own monster filled world. If you can divorce yourself from the ""real"" story I think you'll probably like this film in a B-movie sort of a way.",The Amityville Horror
15,utgard14,Uh-Oh Someone's Scaring the Pretty People Again,5,26 December 2013,"Halfway decent remake of the 1979 film. The 2000s saw a lot of horror films from the '70s and '80s remade. The majority of those were bottom-of-the-barrel garbage. That this manages to be watchable is a feat in and of itself. It's actually one of the better remakes they've done. Still, it suffers from that same drawback as so many horror films of recent years. That is music-video cinematography, over-polished gloss, and action movie pacing that doesn't belong in a horror film. This is especially obvious in remakes as you can compare and contrast with the original. Don't even get me started on why all these movies have to have people with model good looks as the leads. Anyway, the original and its terrible sequels weren't favorites of mine so I don't care as much about them remaking it. As it is, modern production warts and all, it's a watchable horror film with some effective moments.",The Amityville Horror
16,zardoz-13,Better Than The Original,8,18 June 2007,"The worst thing you can say about freshman director Andrew Douglas' remake of the 1979 haunted house chiller ""The Amityville Horror"" (*** out of ****) is that nobody gets killed, unless you count the six people gunned down in their sleep during the atmospheric opening sequence. Those first few eerie moments of this supernatural saga recreate the true-life murders that an insane Ronald Defeo, Jr., committed at the infamous Dutch Colonial house located at 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville on November 13, 1974. Hardcore horror fans who rate fright flicks based on their body count will dismiss ""The Amityville Horror"" as tame. They won't find this horror picture in the same league as either the gruesome ""Saw"" or the ingenious ""What Lies Beneath."" On the other hand, the complaint that audiences consistently make about haunted houses movies is: why don't the fools in the house have enough sense to clear out before they get a taste of their own blood? Interestingly, ""The Amityville Horror"" proves an exception to the rule. The Lutz family skedaddle before they die. Sorry, if I spoiled the ending. Not only did the family get away in the original, but also they manage to escape in the remake. In fact, since the family that vamoosed in real life hasn't died yet, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" scenarist Scott Kosar and Douglas can reasonably call ""The Amityville Horror"" a true story. Like the 1979 version, the new ""Amityville Horror"" draws on the reportedly 'true events' that author Jay Anson chronicled in his bestselling book ""The Amityville Horror."" However, everything that transpires between the times that the Lutz family set foot on the premises until they abandon both their person belongings and the house qualifies as either fabrication or exaggeration. Nevertheless, ""The Amityville Horror"" emerges as an above-average shocker that surpasses the original in both horror and humor in spite of its happy ending. These days Hollywood likes to make horror movies where evil triumphs over good. Society has grown so cynical that horror movies with upbeat endings are a relic of the past.Essentially, ""The Amityville Horror"" depicts the American dream gone to Hell. George (Ryan Reynolds of ""Blade: Trinity"") and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George of ""Dark City"") are newlyweds out house hunting when they discover the deal of their lives in Long Island. The adage that you should worry about what you want, because you might get it lies at the heart of ""The Amityville Horror."" Initially, George believes that they cannot afford such a large mansion, until they learn that the price has been scaled down significantly because of the Defeo murders. George warns Kathy that they will have to live like misers to survive, and Kathy shrieks with delight when he consents to sign the papers. Afterward, unlike the original where James Brolin and Margo Kidder knew about the murders from the get-go, our heroes find out after they inked the contract that a psychotic Italian twentysomething impulsivelyRonald Defeo, Jr.,--shot his mother, father, and four brothers and sisters. At his trial, the killer told the jury that he heard voices ordering him to carry out the execution-style murders. Naturally, George and Kathy withhold the truth from their impressionable children: Billy Lutz (Jesse James of ""The Butterfly Effect""), Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett of ""Hostage"") and Chelsea Lutz (Chloe Moretz of ""Heart of the Beholder""). No sooner has this big happy family moved into their dream house than things take a turn for the worst. Cathy's children still miss their real dad who died from cancer, and they have a hard time bonding with their new stepfather. Similarly, it takes George a while to adjust to fatherhood. The timeless evil spirits lurking in the creepy Dutch Colonial house divide and conqueror the family, turning them against each other. George finds it extremely difficult to stay warm, so he starts chopping wood, more wood than a legion of lumberjacks could hack up. At one point, he forces a rebellious Billy to hold the wood while he swings an axe with terrifying accuracy, splintering the wood into halves while barely missing Billy's hands. Little Chelsea conjures up an invisible playmate named Jodi (newcomer Isabella Connor) who turns out to be the ghost of one of the dead Defeo family. Jodi died in what now serves as Chelsea's closet where Jodi's brother blew a quarter-sized hole through her forehead with a high-powered rifle. Now, Jodi exerts an uncanny, hypnotic power over Chelsea and forces her to disobey her mother. Before they flee the house, the Lutz family is literally clawing at each other's throats. George makes some alarming discoveries about the basement where an 18th century madman performed ritualistic torture, rather like the Spanish Inquisition, on helpless Native Americans.Chiefly, the remake differs in many respects from the original. First, Douglas and Kosar have whittled the running time down to under 90 minutes, compared with the original's near two hour length. Second, they have eliminated some subplots. The subplot about the Catholic priest (Rod Steiger) who blesses the house, hears a voice demanding his departure, then later suffers a nervous breakdown has been drastically altered. Douglas and Kosar have pared this subplot down to only two scenes with one priest. The original also dragged in a detective who maintained surveillance on the Lutzes. This character has also been cut out. Third, the remake pushes more fact than fiction. When George Lutz tears up the basement and finds another room, it isn't a doorway to Hell brimming with sludge and flies. In the Jay Anson novel and the original movie, Jodi appeared as a pig. The performances are better than you'd imagine, especially Ryan Reynolds as a poor man's Jack Nicholson from ""The Shining."" The children cast as the Lutz kids are wonderfully convincing, particular Jesse James. This handsomely-produced remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" is no ""Shining,"" but it tops other recent horror pictures like ""Hide and Seek"" and ""The Grudge.""",The Amityville Horror
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,About what you'd expect... unless you think it will be like the book or the original,6,14 December 2010,"An Indian on TV(...don't ask) makes Ronnie DeFeo kill his six family members in a house in Amityville. At least, I'm pretty sure that's what happens... the editing stylizes the *crap* out of the first half hour(think MTV... Michael Bay ""helped"" out), and in general this is flashy(literally) and doesn't spend time(it tries to rush instead) building up atmosphere(it has a lot of sudden events). Anyway, a year passes and the Lutz' move in. They can't afford it and they are told people died there, so it's a wonder that they go for it. Bad things start happening(not that much like what the novel described, I understand... I prefer it this way), and it appears that George, the husband, is losing his mind... and becoming dangerous to the others(and in this, he doesn't suddenly change back for no reason!). Reynolds does a *great* job at that and is rather frightening, reminiscent of Nicholson in The Shining(not that this is on that level). He also gets to be funny, his best on-screen talent, and several of his most memorable jokes were ad-libbed. The acting is good for all concerned(the kids are fine). There is an excessive amount of exposition(and really early on), we are shown the ghosts, too many of the supernatural occurrences are explained(not as ""what really happened"", but we ""know"" why they happen... there is a fairly clear ""will"" behind them), this eliminates the partner and psychics and minimizes the priest's role. The dialog is meh and seldom natural, with tons of typical Hollywood, for the trailer. Still, the writing isn't all bad, there is an on-going conflict between eldest son Billy(James, Tommy the young psycho from The Butterfly Effect) and ""mom's new man"", the latter also being disciplined and refusing to run away from problems(hence staying in spite of what happens... which also isn't as obviously because of the place as in the '79 one), and the character development is OK for at least those two. This downplays the evil-eye windows and has a better ""get out"" voice. It isn't a straight remake, it merely uses the same overall plot. This is genuinely effective half the time, for the jump-scares and that the suspense and tension are always brief and ""easy""... it's for ADD audiences. Think of this as fast-food; it'll do the job, you'll bitch about the flavour yet keep eating, and you'll want something real to eat soon after. Certain things don't hold up or make sense, bits are over the top(others hit the mark beautifully). It does have a sense of consequence, and both Melissa and Rachel(it's like an Alias reunion!) are *hawt*(the latter can babysit me *anytime*!) and are dressed to highlight this well-known fact. This is a new director so I don't know what we can attribute to him and what we cannot. I'll give his future films a chance. There is plenty of disturbing content, blood, gore and a little strong language and overt sexuality(no nudity) in this. The DVD comes with an interesting commentary track by Ryan(hilarious as ever) and the producers, two documentaries(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site), 9 On Set Peeks(that you can make it play during the movie, they total at 21 minutes), 8 minutes of deleted scenes with the option of hearing their thoughts on them, a preview of Deuce Bigalow 2 and three photo galleries. I recommend this to any fan of haunting stories(it's only 78 min sans credits(!)). Just forget the title. 6/10",The Amityville Horror

The original tried to make the story believable and at least emulate a true story. The latest Amityville Horror added scenes, special effects, and events that made it less believable.SCENES NOT NEEDED: girl on the roof, George cutting wood while boy holding it, plethora of flies coming from the heater duct, family escaping on the roof, mom having to nearly kill George, and George killing the dog.SCENE NEEDED: the nun visiting the house and issuing her warning.I'm finally at the age in which I'm witnessing remakes of movies I actually saw the original of and now I see what so many of my elders have always been complaining about.",The Amityville Horror

There is nothing here which hasn't been seen a number of times.Where this falls down is in being tied to the Amityville name. The original movie did at least stay reasonably close to the book which, itself, purported to be a true account of odd but relatively mild phenomena, the worst of which was the mental effect of the house.This version goes into full manifestation mode early on and, in so doing splits away from the very story it trades on.The babysitter is laughably improbable, and worth the price of a ticket on her own.The kids are quite good.",The Amityville Horror

The Plot:Widow Kath Lutzs feels its time for her three kids and her boyfriend George to move house.Kath and George end up finding a house at a really great price(due to a family of six being murdered there!),but due to them being scraped for cash they end up taking the place,and over the next 28 days ,the family start having mental breakdowns.When the house shows that it has ""voices"" trying to get George to repeat the murder of a family,by killing his own. View on the film:I have to say that the performance by Ryan Reynolds and Rachel Nicols are the things that save the film.I was very surprise how Reynolds was able to strip-away the ""comedy"" side of his past roles,and do a very good dark and isolated performance,while Nicols only has a supporting role as a hippieish-rock girl baby sitter.She is able to give a a good and slightly edgy performance.Sadly the film is one of the most un-horror horror films i have seen!.The story is a very poor take on other horrors from the past (Ie:The Shining),and it gives you hardly and build-up to them getting the house,and the only jumps was when the music suddenly kicks in!.It also has one of the worst endings i have seen for any film.

Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George move into a huge house where a family was murdered. Premise is rushed so to move the family in and send them through a series of gruesome encounters where they question their sanity. It contains none of the life like reality of the original and director Andrew Douglas proves to be interested in nothing more than the technical elements. Visually the film is stunning with its horrific images but screenplay and acting are pitiful. Reynolds goes through a quick personality change as voices tell him to ""kill them!"" Too bad the voice didn't tell him to walk off set. George fares little better as his wife. Phillip Baker Hall plays a Priest who enters their home and is attacked by flies. Perhaps a little insect repellent will do the trick. The children present are there to hear things go bump in the night and scream for mercy. This is a kind reminder that Chloe Grace Moretz goes on to bigger and thankfully better things. It serves as a reminder that Hollywood is only interested in a quick buck and with this pointless junk they succeed in delivering a film that is about as enjoyable as having your stomach pumped. At least give us the opportunity to upchuck on the film. Score: 2 / 10",The Amityville Horror
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Huge improvement over the original,9,1 October 2015,"Moving into a new house in New York, a family comes to believe that his new-found behavior is the cause of a haunted curse plaguing the house and try to stop it from influencing the rest of the family.Overall this one was quite an improved remake over the original. What makes this one so good is this goes far more openly for the idea of something being wrong here in the house, which is fairly liberally spread throughout here. It makes great use of several great factors for this, giving the impression of something evil at work here with the force moving through the vents, the numerous times along the first half of him being oblivious to something around him, the flashes of the ghost girl around the room and the different antics of the family being tormented by the demonic forces at work still here which is what gives this one some really fun at building the idea of a supernatural presence in the house. As well, there's so much at play here regarding how he is targeted and tormented with the ghostly voices, flashing demon faces and the incessant worrying over nothing that festers his slow-building rage into possession that something is clearly not right with him that continues to build the ghostly presences here, and comes off as a far more improved version of the same antics in the original. Furthering that, the action here is much more pronounced with some really great ideas with this, starting with the assault on the babysitter which is chilling enough with the locked door and flickering lights but throwing in the actions of the girl and her messed up features makes for a creepiness factor in the scene that really works here, the children coming into play in the different rooms of the house and the later half chasing through the house as the now-possessed stalker goes after the rest of the family through the house with both shotguns and axes from the kitchen up through the attic, out onto the roof and down into the boathouse for a series of dark, chilling scenes that make this so much fun and end this one a high-note. There's enough here with these elements to hold off several rather minor flaws in here. The main element is that there's such a big sense of building the supernatural to the extent here that it doesn't seem logical for the family to stay there at all, especially some of the obscure behavior committed by the kids even before getting to the actions of the parents. That alone really sells this as something being wrong, for the blatant personality change coupled with the other kids' problems all make this part somewhat problematic. The only other factor here against this one is that it feel way too much like a remake of the original without giving it a different identity. These issues hold it down while the bigger positives make it enjoyable.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, children-in-jeopardy, drug use and violence-against-animals.",The Amityville Horror

What they don't know is that the house was the site of a horrific murder a year before. They decide to keep the house and attempt to keep the past in the past, but are now haunted by a murderous presence. This is until, George starts to behave weirdly and their daughter, Chelsea starts to see people. What follows is 28 days of sheer, unbridled terror for the family with demonic visions of the dead.......It's a Michael Bay production, so instead of going for subtle scares, we get the good old loud screeching noises and strange editing whenever we are treated to a shock. So you have no other choice but to jump.But, maybe it's because of all those horrid sequels to the first movie, I never fail to enjoy the movie whenever it comes my way.George and Reynolds maybe a little too young to be cast, but they are both believable with the material they are given which is basically George to be upset for the majority of the film and for Reynolds to grow a beard so he looks like James Brolin, take his shirt off, and wear bloodshot contacts when he's in the house.It's short harmless fun, it has the Bay sheen all over it, but at least it stays kind of true to the wholly untrue true story.Just turn the sound down a little.",The Amityville Horror
25,Aaron1375,Well there is no going back for the dog in this one.,8,8 October 2005,"I know this will outrage lovers of the original movie which I thought was an okay ghost story, but more happens in the first twenty minutes of this one than happens in the entire film of the original movie. Granted some of the things that happen are a total rip off of such recent films like ""The Grudge"" and ""The Ring"", but it still makes for an entertaining horror film. Unlike those two mentioned above, however, this film is a bit more graphic and is actually rated R which at least steers away from the trend of making the pg-13 horror film for the entire family. The film has a lot of the same elements as the first one, it keeps the same date and setting...a family where the father is a step moves into a house that should be out of their price range, but isn't. Why? Well there were murders there of course, another family was killed there and it kind of brings down the price considerably. Why are all real estate agents so darn gung ho about selling a house that they never tell the new owners about the odd stuff they see in just the few minutes they are there. Well everything goes great, that first afternoon while moving in, after that visions of those slain appear at the most inappropriate times and blood drips freely from various objects. Throw in a really annoying babysitter that gets a bit more than she deserves (being fired would be more appropriate) and you got yourself a very nice and a bit bloody haunted house movie. The only weak spot I thought there would be is Ryan Reynolds in the lead role, but he did rather good, but I still think Brolin was better as George Lutz, but they seemed to be going for a more of a Shining type possession rather than the more subtle one of the earlier movie. Worth a look see and a couple of scares.",The Amityville Horror
26,Wuchakk,Effective haunted house movie with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George,7,1 November 2012,"A young couple with three children buys an old, large house on Long Island in 1975. The house has a diabolic history, but they purchase it anyway because it's such a great deal. Will they make it out alive?I didn't have high hopes for ""The Amityville Horror"" (2005) because I'm not a fan of haunted house movies and thus had not yet seen the original version. But I decided to give it a try due to Melissa George. The movie maintains a serious tone throughout and did not disappoint; it successfully piqued my interest in the whole Amityville Horror legend, which you can read about on the internet.Some may accuse the film of ripping off aspects of ""The Shining"" (1980), but keep in mind that the original movie was released a year before ""The Shining"" while the books they were based on were both published in 1977. The difference is that ""The Amityville Horror"" was inspired by supposedly true events whereas Stephen King's novel was purely fictional.Of course this remake inspired me to see the classic version from 1979 with James Brolin and Margot Kidder. What I like about that one is that it takes its time to develop the characters in what is essentially a realistic drama topped off with creepy paranormal happenings. It addresses dark, ugly stuff but it actually has a warm heart (recall what George does in the final scene). This brisk 2005 remake is like the Reader's Digest version, unsurprisingly upping the ante with the (clichéd) horror elements; it thankfully offers interesting details on the backstory of the house. I think they're both worth checking out. If you prefer longer with more depth you'll favor the original version whereas if you want something faster and more modern you'll appreciate this one.Melissa George is a gorgeous woman and I enjoy watching her. Also on hand on the feminine front is Rachel Nichols, who played Tamara in the 2011 redo of ""Conan the Barbarian."" Rachel plays a hippie chick babysitter and she's perfect for the role. The babysitter is haughty and scoffs at the diabolic history of the house but let's just say she leaves as a true believer. This was a great sequence that perked my interest at a time it needed it (as I was starting to get bored by that point). In any event, I had to reassess my appraisal of Ms. Nichols after seeing her in this film as she won my appreciation. Meanwhile Chloë Grace Moretz plays the little girl; she was only 7 when the film was shot.Ryan Reynolds as the husband is fine, but he seems TOO in-shape for the role. However, I'm sure the ladies appreciate it.The film runs 1 hour, 29 minutes, and was shot at Silver Lake and Salem, Wisconsin, with other parts filmed in the Chicago area of Illinois.GRADE: B.",The Amityville Horror
27,gradyharp,More then just another re-telling of the quasi-factual Amityville Horror,8,18 January 2007,"Just the name of this film constitutes a long sigh - 'How many times are they going to make this hokey story into yet another film?' And yet the current team of director Andrew Douglas, screenwriter Scott Kosar (based on Jay Anson's novel) and a cast of fresh faces to the genre carry off this much told tale with vigor and a good dollop of tension.For starters the film opens with the re-enactment of the 'actual crime'. Apparently in 1974 Ronald DeFeo (here Brendan Donaldson) murdered his parents and siblings in a terrific old house in Amityville, NY. One year later the Lutz family discovers their dream house and buys it outright, opening their next 28 days to visions of ghosts, terror, demons, hallucinations and pathological changes among themselves until they finally flee the haunted house.From the start we know that contractor George Lutz - Ryan Reynolds - (the new husband of Kathy) - Melissa George - has problems establishing himself as the 'stepfather' to reluctant children Billy (Jesse James), Michael (Jimmy Bennett) and Chelsea (Chloë Grace Moretz). Once the family is ensconced in the house Chelsea begins to play with the ghost of Jodie DeFeo (Isabel Conner) and George's personality changes as a result of the house's curse. It all comes down to terror in the requisite thunder, lightning and rain of all horror films until the family hits crisis state and leaves the house behind.The ghost effects are well done and the cinematography by Peter Lyons Collister and the musical score by Steve Jablonsky create a dark, ominous atmosphere. But the real reason to watch this little thriller is the work of Ryan Reynolds as George, released from his usual silly potty mouth roles in teenie films to show that he indeed can act, and keep his own brand of edgy humor intact - and that is no slight feat. Fortunately he is given the opportunity to display his extraordinarily hunky physique throughout the film, reason enough to see the movie! Melissa George is likewise excellent as the tortured mother and is a perfect foil for Reynolds. Not a great film, but certainly one that exceeds expectations set by previous forays into this overused story. Grady Harp",The Amityville Horror

The first 3/4 of this movie is scary. I found the last 25% a bit over the top. A nastier version of the first with a more meaning feel to it . Evil lies, devides and leads to insanity is part of this story. The acting and directing is perfect and believable. A couple of scares in this film that made me jump and I never jump. at least in the last couple of years.

Now, right after they move there, the girlfriend starts having all sorts of demands, children being stressful and skeletons getting out of the closets. Now, while this may be considered a metaphor for a relationship gone awry, this is actually a horror movie, and a well done one. Although I will keep my personal opinion that there was actually a hidden message in the movie, since in the end, wimpy guy joins the ghosts and proceeds on killing his family.Now the ghosts look like a cross between Asian ghosts (you can clearly see them, they look dead, but when you try to validate your view they are just not there) and western ghosts (bloody and damaged). There is this Poltergeist meets Shining feeling during the movie. The actors play well, the soundtrack is appropriate, the ghosts are rather violent for ""I don't believe in"" ghosts, but they're OK. The whole movie feeling is scary, John Saul or Stephen King like, so OK, thumbs up for this one.Still, I felt that it borrowed too much from the two fore-mentioned movies. Actually, the events described in the movie are very close to real, there was a Lutz family that moved in after a brutal killing of a family, that claimed that the house was horribly haunted. Unfortunately it was a publicity and legal stunt to get the original killer free on a ""demonic defense"", whatever legality that would have had.",The Amityville Horror
30,JamesHitchcock,Not even based on an allegedly true story.,4,23 October 2009,"In the mid-seventies the small Long Island town of Amityville had an unwanted notoriety thrust upon it. On November 13, 1974 a young man named Ronald DeFeo shot dead six members of his family at their home, 112 Ocean Avenue. The next occupiers of the house, George and Kathy Lutz, claimed that they were forced out by a series of psychical disturbances during their brief occupation in the winter of 1975-76. The Lutzes' account was in 1977 turned into a novel by Jay Anson under the title ""The Amityville Horror"". This became a publishing sensation, leading to the 1979 screen adaptation and several sequels. The Amityville story was big news in the seventies and eighties, and the popularity of the films was doubtless due to the fact that, following the success of ""The Exorcist"", supernatural horror films were much in vogue at the time. The whole Amityville saga seemed to have run its course, but a new cinematic vogue for horror evidently persuaded someone that it was time for a remake.Like many films of this type this one advertises itself as being based upon a true story, but as I pointed out when I reviewed the recent ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", another haunted house movie, there is a big difference between a true story and something based on a true story, and an even bigger one between a true story and something based on an allegedly true story. Now I have never given much credence to the Lutzes' version of events, partly because of my natural scepticism about claims of the paranormal and partly because subsequent occupiers of the house have not experienced any psychic phenomena at all, but the 2005 ""Amityville Horror"" doesn't even keep to the story peddled by the Lutzes. It therefore cannot even claim to be based on an allegedly true story.The real 112 Ocean Avenue is a detached suburban house, but the house in this film is a substantial mansion, set in open countryside by a lake. (The film was actually shot in Wisconsin rather than Long Island). The only similarities to the original house are a general Dutch-Colonial style and the two famous quarter-round windows which feature prominently in most depictions of the house, largely because they look something like a pair of staring eyes. An important role is played by the ghost of five year old Jodie DeFeo, supposedly one of the slaughtered children, but in fact Ronald DeFeo never had a sister named Jodie; his two sisters were named Dawn and Allison, and both were teenagers at the time of their death.Probably the most significant departure from earlier versions of the story is that George attacks and attempts to kill Kathy and her children, after having been possessed by evil spirits and driven mad. DeFeo's massacre of his family is also attributed to demonic possession. The paranormal events are attributed to the fact that the basement of the house was supposedly used in the 1690s by a preacher named Father Katchem to imprison and torture local American Indians. This claim was never made about the real Amityville house- hardly surprising given that the house only dates from the 1920s. George Lutz hated this version so much that he attempted to sue the film-makers, a lawsuit that was only ended by his death in 2006.Another difference is that the actors playing George and Kathy, Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, were both still in their twenties, considerably younger than their real-life counterparts; Melissa is only thirteen years older than Jesse James, who plays her eldest son. Although she will be best known to British audiences as a sexy glamour-girl from the Australian soap opera ""Home and Away"", Hollywood casting directors obviously see Melissa as the maternal type. In her next film ""Derailed"", also from 2005, she was again cast as the impossibly young-looking mother of a teenager.As a film, ""The Amityville Horror"" is by no means the worst of its type; it is, for example, rather better than ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", and the special effects are not as over-the-top as in many horror films. It suffers, however, from its attempt to pass itself off as a true story, when it quite patently is nothing of the sort, and also suffers from another fault, a common one these days. Director Andrew Douglas fails to realise that in a ghost film what you don't see can often be more frightening than what you do. It is for precisely this reason that the understated horror films made before the digital effects revolution, such as the original ""The Haunting"" from the 1960s, are generally more effective than modern ones, where everything is spelt out in all its gory detail. Overstated horror films like ""Amityville"" have become over-familiar in recent years and hence have lost their power to shock. 4/10",The Amityville Horror

The real estate assures the Lutz's that it's all behind them now and the house is perfectly fine. They buy the house and move their family in. Almost immediately George Lutz senses something wrong about the house. Slowly the house begins to haunt and possess George the same way it had done to Ronald a year earlier. Kathy and her kids from her previous husband who passed away gradually begin to fear George and the entities that haunt their house.The film plays out like a typical horror story, about a Haunted House but it's still frighteningly entertaining and the cast is amazing. The films setting which takes place in the seventies somehow adds to the mood and feel and also the realism of it all. The back story of the Defeo family and their murder is perfectly intertwined to the new story of the Lutz's and the pace of the film is perfect. The absolute shining star of the film is the amazing Ryan Reynolds. In my opinion Jack Nicholson's ""The Shining"" character could only dream about being as good as Reynolds was. There are blatantly obvious comparisons to that film...a man slowly losing his mind and being possessed to the point of complete insanity and a deep desire to murder his entire family. George Lutz is such a kind, gentle, protective family man and yet we watch his spiral into insanity to where he becomes this cold killer that we fear. He is the best good guy, and an amazing bad guy. Reynolds is one of the best breakthrough actors I have seen in recent years. He is proving himself with each amazing film and this is a great example. Melissa George also plays the hippie, free spirited, motherly wife role quite well. Despite finding herself torn between the man she desperately loves and protecting her children from him she shows strength and courage. The kids are well played but not overly used which is a good thing. The film basically relies on Reynolds and Melissa George's characters. This is one of the best films of the year in a year which has been so far really great for films, there has been some really amazing work. Newcomer director Andrew Douglas should get kudos for doing an amazing job on this mainstream horror film that will entertain you definitely. Everyone should check this out!!! AMAZING!! 9/10 Only loses a perfect score because of it's slight lack of originality.",The Amityville Horror
35,MLDinTN,not much suspense,5,3 October 2006,"The main problem with this movie is since it's a remake, you basically already know what will happen and what problem lies in the house. The story is a little different than the original. This movie gives the basement of the house more of a history; it's more than just a gateway too hell. It also explains why the house is haunted. I thought the remake had less creepy moments; no rooms filled with flies, no red eyes in windows. And how did the little girl get on top of the steep roof. And why did the priest not really care about helping the family.And 2 hot actors were cast as the leads. But it takes more than that to make the movie entertaining. It is like they wanted to make this for the young teen audience, but then decided to through in curse words to make it R.FINAL VERDICT:OK, but if you have seen the original, it ruins this one some. It would have been better if you didn't already know the story.",The Amityville Horror
36,Cineanalyst,Get a Divorce,3,13 June 2021,"A battered woman seeks solace from a priest, and he tells her to move with her family, including her husband. I know the Church has a long history of opposing divorce, but c'mon, blaming a house on a guy trying to murder his family with an axe, not to mention the dog, is going overboard. As is remaking a haunted house flick by adding seizure-inducing stroboscopic montages, more of a madman wielding an axe, an Indian burial ground, or torture chamber, or whatever, and, because they just remade ""The Ring"" (1998 and 2002), too, a ghost girl. The inclusion of the TV is probably part of the general derivativeness, as well. And, why not while you're at it cast Ryan Reynolds to do the same wise-cracking persona he always does before going crazy. At least it's shorter and better paced than the 1979 film--excising much of the original's needless first act of moving into the house and the picture's subsequent Catholicism and police investigation--but it's dreadful all the same.",The Amityville Horror

This is why we shouldn't lie. We get bad movies like this! Anyway, I never liked any of the other movies in this series.This seemed like just a ripoff of ""The Shining"". I haven't seen the original film in awhile, but I don't think they had the plot of the dad (or stepdad in this case) going crazy and trying to kill the family. It's hard to make flies scary.

This version is one of my favorite horror films for a number of reasons. It is a very subtle possession tale, and far more realistic than most possession movies out there today. The mere fact that it is based on a true story makes it all that more intriguing, especially since I'm familiar with the actual events.Ryan Reynolds is so good in the role of real-life George Lutz. His progression from ordinary guy to possessed is effective and creepy. This near-perfect horror film doesn't rely on blood, guts and gore to keep the viewer engaged. Beware: this film contains unpredictable jump scares. I loved the set-up in the big, spooky old mansion, and the house's history.The entire cast is excellent. Chloë Grace Moretz is fantastic as the youngest daughter, Chelsea. Ah, yes, and then there's Ryan Reynolds. 'The Amityville Horror' is a must for Reynolds fans who want to marvel at that perfect physique.The film is fast-paced, and engaging from beginning to end, with very good editing.

42,tomgillespie2002,Run-of-the-mill remake of a not very good original,3,11 September 2011,"Platinum Dunes production company was formed by Michael Bay, Brad Fuller and Andrew Form in 2001, with the prime proposal of re-making, predominantly 1970's ""classic"" (albeit well-known) horror films. Their first was The Texas Chain-saw Massacre (2003). They messed around with Friday the 13th (2009), -as if it really needed to be done after nine sequels - and A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), after producing a ""modern"" take on 1979's The Amityville Horror. I state modern only in the time of production, as the film is set in the 1970's. After all it is ""based on a true story"" (I will come back to this later).The film begins, - as does it's predecessor - with a dramatically edited prologue of the ""actual"" event that occurred in the house in 1974, when Ronald Defeo systematically shot his parents and siblings whilst they slept in their beds. This did actually happen, and Defeo is still serving a life sentence for the horrific crime. The crime was blamed by Ronald on voices that told him to kill them. Several years later, Kathy (Melissa George) and George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) purchase the Amityville ""dream home"" cheaply. They move in with Kathy's three children (from a previous marriage). This is clearly a new arrangement, as - particularly the oldest - child is suspicious of the new father figure.Well, the film has no build-up of tension at all, as moments into occupying the house, they begin to see things. Now traditionally in the haunted house genre of horror films, ghosts are not really physically seen. However, in this movie, they are simply there! George goes ""crazy"" practically instantly, and the tensions within the family are automatically tumultuous. The ""ghosts"" of the Jody, one of the little girls killed, are seen by youngest child, Chelsea (Chloe Moretz - in pre-Hit Girl, use-of-the-word ""c**t"" mode), and communicates through her. The opening sequence is endemic of these Michael Bay produced films. Snappy, flash editing; the layering of images, and particularly dirty pen-scribblings on paper. Essentially a title sequence, post-Seven (1997). It does benefit from contemporary footage of news-reels shot at the time of the Defeo murders. These ""funky"" openings are also quite stylist, and for production value, lends an almost artistic flare to proceedings. However, it does not save a very run-of-the-mill film, that ticks all the boxes of a remake/ghost-horror movie.So, we come back to the ""based on a true story"". This is a story that I have been fascinated by from a very early age, when I saw the film, and read the Jay Anson book of the same name. The Lutz family did purchase the house, knowing that it was the scene of the Defeo crime. 28 days later they fled the property, leaving all of their belongings (never to return). They reported the strange and horrific occurrences. Well, they did to a writer, who promised a lucrative publishing deal (ghost stories were hot in the '70's). this obviously led to the money-making deal of Hollywood movie-making. So their story of haunting, Indian burial grounds, and possession, was a highly profitable for the family, who were not well-off at all. With the knowledge of the houses history, it would be easy to conjure up a ghost story in 28 days. ""F**k the possessions, eh?"" As an ""after thought"", there have been many families that have occupied the house, who have never reported any strange ""happenings."" The only reason that any of them have left, was simply due to ""sightseers"" who trample over the grounds, due to the popularity of the film.

The story in this film is relatively quite simple and the film had a short runtime where things happen quite quickly.The acting by Ryan Reynolds is solid as he portrays a role in which he has not played up until that point in his career (this film was released in 2005 where he was still relatively new as leading man). Chloe Moretz in one of her earliest roles was part of the highlight.Overall with no expectations and although the film was predictable in the end, there are a decent enough thrills, jump scares, good visuals, and suspense to enjoy.",The Amityville Horror
44,johnnyboyz,It Does Enough,6,17 April 2005,"I must admit, seeing Horror films at the cinema hasn't REALLY been a particularly large attraction to me over the past year or so. This may be due to the fact that there haven't been any particularly good one released that I can think of so going in with the knowledge that the last 'horror' film or film that made me jump at least, was 'What Lies Beneath' five years ago, I knew was going to see and feel something I hadn't yet experienced in a cinema yet, or at least not for a long time.I hadn't heard of the other films made before this based on the same events but WAS informed that it was a true story beforehand. This didn't detract from the pleasurable viewing I had throughout. Although the 'trapped' feeling isn't really evident in the film as it is spaced out quite widely, this isn't a bad thing despite 90 per cent of the film's actually in the house. It's spooky, scary and has enough of those 'jump' moments to keep a thrill seeker happy every once in a while. The acting isn't anything particularly special but does it have to be? Reynolds DOES, however, put in a good performance as the nervous, 'Am I going Mad?' character that you can really see build up within him as the film progresses at its clever pace.The erie music that is found within is definitely a talking point. It seems that 'too much of a good thing is bad for you' and that very much applies here. As it reaches its peak, you are basically peering at the screen KNOWING that someone or something is going to appear- guess what; they do! But it's the range of different things that appear during hallucination that backs it up. Dogs into demons, little girls with nooses around their necks and torture victims are just three of the things ready to greet you on screen as we 'see' what the characters see.I think that the Amityville Horror is worth the money, but only REALLY if you're into the thrills and jumps that go with a standard horror film. I, myself, as I've explained haven't made a habit of seeing films like this over the years and since I was out with some horror fans for the first time, I wasn't sure what to expect from this film; it turns out that I enjoyed it.Veterans however, especially 'Sixth Sense' fans may be slightly disappointed as it can't really get out of first gear. It was only afterwards when I realised it was thrills and jumps all the way through with no REAL plot. Enjoyable if you're up for it but REAL horror fans I think should avoid.",The Amityville Horror
45,filipemanuelneto,How not to make a remake,4,23 November 2016,"This movie is a remake of a 1979 horror classic, which most people no longer know. Despite this, almost all lovers of supernatural stories have heard of the crimes of Amityville and the death of the DeFeo family. The crime was true, as was the Lutz family's stay in that house for about a month. But the so-called ""true story"" on which this film is based ends here. The idea that the Lutz were also plagued by the supposed ghosts of this infamous house is apparently a complete invention, that the cinema has merely exploited and inflamed.Comparing this movie with its 1979 predecessor is inglorious. If the original has long been forgotten, the new film deserves to be forgotten. It's a bad movie, it never really fears the public, it fails by being absolutely predictable. It brings nothing new, interesting or appealing, limiting itself to making use of a famous story of presumed haunting to make some money. It has an uninteresting script and the special, visual and sound effects are not remarkable, using the most rehearsed recipes of horror movies. Actors' interpretation is boring, with the praiseworthy exception of Ryan Reynolds, who plays George Lutz. This actor wasn't brilliant, but managed to meet the minimums that were required of him.",The Amityville Horror

""The Amytiville Horror"" remake abuses of the CGI effects in most of it's scenes. I must admit that some of them take the audience by surprise and that's not necessary good as the movie is filled with false scares. It's a shame that with such a good premise, this remake looks like a PG-13 ghost movie. ""The Amytiville Horror"" is more than that. The last scene of the movie is truly laughable. It's a mix of wasted CGI with a rip-off of ""The Grudge"" or ""The Ring"". What does the new Horror producers have with CGI ghost girls?! The best thing about the remake in my opinion is Ryan Reynold's performance. The man delivers solid acting and truly convinces as a possessed psycho. Also, the cinematography is pretty good. The high amount of gore just doesn't work this time. Give this movie a chance if you haven't seen the original.

I even used to live near that dreaded city! Ryan Renyolds did resemble Brolin just a little bit only better looking. And even there are some fresh faces there, some of the scenes have a lot more detail of the facts of the incident than the 1979 version. Yes, it's creepy, and I've my shares of living in a haunted house.

Surprisingly, the character development was even decent.That having been said; however...Even after the original was proved to be nothing but a conspiracy between the writer and the Lutz family, they STILL had the nerve to bill this as a ""true story!!"" WTF?! I mean, not even a ""based on,"" but a TRUE STORY! There should be something illegal about that, if there isn't. There seems to be little doubt that one of the most famous American hauntings to ever be documented occurred in the quiet town of Amityville, New York, a peaceful enclave on Long Island's south shore. There stands no other case from the latter part of the 20th Century that so captured the imagination of the general public... and no other case that filled us with such fear. I was barely a teenager when the sensational book by Jay Anson, ""The Amityville Horror"", was released. I will never forget snatching up a copy from a local bookstore, only to read it and then re-read it again. Could such things really happen? Could ghosts destroy a family the way that evil spirits did George and Kathy Lutz? Could a ghost force someone to kill, as demonic entities caused Ronald DeFeo to murder his entire family? And most terrifying of all.... could the American public be so easily deceived into believing the events chronicled in the book were actually real? The answer to that question is a resounding ""yes"" as is proved by the fact that many people still believe in the veracity of ""The Amityville Horror"", one of the greatest paranormal hoaxes of all time! But how did it all begin? How could we all be fooled so easily? And what events led up to the release of the book? To answer those inquiries, we have to go back to November 1974 and understand the true events that occurred in the house on Ocean Avenue. The horrific carnage that prefaced the story of the ""Amityville Horror"" began one dark fall night in 1974. The DeFeos, Ronald Sr. and Louise, their two young sons, Mark and John, and two daughters, Dawn and Allison, were sleeping peacefully in their comfortable, three-story, Dutch Colonial home in Amityville. The silence of the house was shattered when Ronald DeFeo murdered his parents and his siblings with a high-powered rifle. One by one, he killed each of them as they slept, although strangely, the sound of the gunshots never awakened the other family members. DeFeo blamed the massacre on the malevolent force of an evil spirit that was present in the house. He stated that the creature began speaking to him and controlled him while he committed the murders. Not surprisingly, he pleaded insanity at his trial. The prosecutor countered the plea by stating that DeFeo was not crazy at all, but merely trying to cash in on his parent's substantial life insurance polices. Again though, we are left with an unanswered question.. how could DeFeo have thought that he would get away with the murders and in turn, collect on the insurance policies? Regardless, the jury ignored DeFeo's claims and found him guilty of six counts of first-degree murder. State Supreme Court Justice Thomas M. Stark sentenced him to 150 years in prison. This, along with the publication of ""The Amityville Horror Conspiracy"" by Stephen Kaplan, should have put an end to the case, but it did not. In fact, more than two decades later, people still often question the facts behind the case and the real events that may, or may not, have occurred in Amityville. Today, most researchers concede that the story was mostly, if not entirely, fabricated. To the general public though, the truth remains much more of a shadowy thing. While this movie gives you the ""updated"" version of the ""story,"" it's still just one big lie. Don't waste your time. It rates a 2.5/10 from... the Fiend :.",The Amityville Horror

The revised cinematic version of the 1979 flick, which was based on the Jay Anson novel which bears the same name, does have its demonic moments. For those of you who have been left in the ""dark"" for years of this famed haunted house tale, this is the true story of the Lutz's family revolting experience when they moved in to a Long Island three-story house in 1975. George and Kathy Putz I mean Lutz moved in the house even though they were informed that in that same abode the previous year the eldest son of the Defeo family of seven killed his entire family in a repulsive bloodbath. Things were definitely looking ""Defeo"" for the Lutzes when they experienced mischievous spite occurrences throughout their abridged stay. Let's just say ""28 Days Later"" after they moved in, they were gone!!!!! Director Andrew Douglas effectively amalgamates a 30-year old legendary haunted house story with contemporary cinematic technology for a new generation of horror films aficionados. Or in other words, he does a fine job in mixing ""Spirits In The Material World"". Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George execute middle-of-the-road performances as the Lutzes. The great Phillip Baker Hall was shamefully miscast as Father Callaway who gets straight ""bees"" in Religion when he tries to bless the doomed crib. Writer Scott Kosar did do a laudable job on the challenging task of adapting Jay Anson's astonishing book; even though Kosar threw way too many scribing interceptions with the George Lutz dialogue.

55,drownnnsoda,One Of Those Rare Instances Where A Remake Surpasses The Original.,7,22 April 2006,"After hearing about this remake of ""The Amityville Horror"", I was actually kind of excited to see what they'd done with it. I didn't like the original film so much, it was a little overrated in my opinion, and was hoping they'd improve it a little. And surprisingly, they did, and I enjoyed it more this time around. Let's admit it, the original ""Amityville"" was no fine piece of film-making. It was a decent film, but it had a lot of problems.This movie begins with George and Kathy Lutz (this time played by Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George), who are house searching in Long Island, New York. They find a beautiful Dutch colonial mansion, built back in the 1700's, and the price is a steal. But there is a catch - a family was murdered in the house a year earlier by their eldest son, who claimed he ""heard voices telling him to do it"". George and Kathy decide they will try to make it work, and end up buying the house. But once they move in, bizarre events begin almost immediately. The kids are seeing apparitions, and George is slowly going crazy, as the ghosts of the former family and those of an Indian tribe who were tortured on the land haunt the house.I liked the back story put in the film, the original ""Amityville"" left a lot unexplained (and what was explained was still very unclear) and this film goes in-depth with more history behind the house, while the original film hardly even hinted at it. This remake has some pretty scary moments (although there is a significant over-use of 'jump' scares) and decent acting from all involved. I really thought the babysitter closet scene was great as well, one of the most memorable scenes from this remake. There are many flashy, fast shots that are used to scare in the film, which seems to be a style used in modern horror movies. There were some really good performances though between the parents and the children. They even left one good scare right at the end before the credits roll, which was kind of clever in a way.Overall, this was a really good remake. It has it's flaws here and there, and it is fairly clichéd, but I'd say it's one that surpasses the original just by a small bit, in my perspective anyway. It at least made an attempt to clear some of the plot holes up that the original film left, and I liked it better for that reason. I think it's a tad better than the 1979 original, but that's just my opinion. 7/10.",The Amityville Horror

Later they realized that the house is cursed and one of the family members is possessed by an evil spirit in their new home.Directed by Andrew Douglas made an faster paced and shorter somewhat punchier remake of the popular 1979 horror movie. No doubt, this remake has its share of faults. But the new script is much clearer understanding more of this simple, effective tale. The new version has some genuine thrills, the performances are good (especially Reynolds in one of his few dramatic roles) but this movie in a odd sense, it is closer to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining in some moments.This one also has nice but brief memorable roles for Rachel Nichols as the sexy babysitter and Philip Baker Hall as the Priest. Which the screenwriter of this new version was wise enough to reduce the subplot of the priest from the original movie. Which to make it tighter and to feel closer to the family members in this new take. Despite the movie wasn't screened for the critics, i find this version to be slightly better than the original. The thing i loved from the original so much is the effective Oscar-nominated music score by Lola Schifrin (Which it was reject score for ""The Exorcist""!), Strong Performances by James Brolin & Margot Kidder and some truly strong creepy moments. But the original had it share of unintentional humour and Rod Steiger's performance as the Priest was way Over the Top at times. One of the flaws in this remake is towards the conclusion with an complete false moment that nearly ruined the effectiveness in this version.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by actor:Reynolds & the film's producers:Andrew Form and Brad Fuller. DVD also has two featurettes, deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reynolds, Form & Fuller and more. Some will truly enjoy this remake or disliked it. But die hard fans of the original will probably liked this reinvigorated version. One of the film's producers is top action Hollywood filmmaker:Michael Bay (Bad Boys 1 & 2, Armageddon, The Rock).

Also, the movie ""Burnt Offerings"", or ""Stir of Echoes"" (all suspiciously same plots, screenwriters must all be tapping the same database)!.Because Philip Baker Hall was in this film, I gave it a gratuitous 3 stars; his talent is wasted, as he is in one brief scene; priest/exorcism, etc.Rent any of the above mentioned movies first, they are more original, and they have actual actors in them.",The Amityville Horror
59,Jonny_Numb,"""For God's Sake, Get Out Of The Theater!""",4,24 April 2005,"I've let the 'experience' of ""The Amityville Horror"" remake sink in for about a week now, and the more I ponder it, the more rotten it seems. When I first heard that a remake of the notorious 1979 bore was in the works, I couldn't help but be a little intrigued (as this could have been the rare case of a remake exceeding its predecessor), and even went so far as to ignore the fact that executive-producer Michael Bay had dunked the good name of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the outhouse toilet 2 years prior. Even if it were in the hands of some talentless music-video hack with a penchant for gore, grue, and loud musical stingers (that really do nothing but show how dumb filmmakers think their audiences are), I couldn't help but think that even THAT would make for something more entertaining than the 1979 original.And to a degree, I was right. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. After making it through half of the movie with a straight, sincere face, I began to wonder if the guy down front who laughed at inopportune points was onto something and I was giving the film too much consideration.The new ""Amityville Horror"" is better than its parent, but it still remains a substandard genre entry with cardboard characters, ostentatious cinematography, gore for gore's sake, and an ugly sadistic streak that also popped up in the aforementioned TCM remake (does Mr. Bay torture cats when nobody's looking?). Okay, the Lutz family moves into a Long Island home where a disturbed (possibly possessed) young man murdered his family one year prior, and find that his heinous mojo is at work in the rooms...or is it the ghost of a lunatic preacher who massacred a bunch of Indians (in the oh-so-classic ""Cenobite Style"") a century before? The script doesn't seem to care either way, just so long as a lot of gratuitous shock effects are paraded about to dilute any lasting horror or atmosphere (most absurd being a sequence where father George--played by Ryan Reynolds--is splattered and splattered and splattered with gore, to make a psychological point in the most ham-handed way possible).The original ""Amityville Horror"" failed because it dragged on for 2 hours and very little of what happened was interesting. Comparatively, this remake runs just over 80 minutes (unusually economical for a studio film) but goes too far in the opposite direction, constantly pinning us to our seats with excess; we emerge from the film exhausted and weary, hollowed out by its enervating futility (these remakes are becoming nothing but exercises in marketing, not artistic license). If the original was the cure for insomnia, Andrew Douglas (a music-video director making his feature debut, don't'cha'know) views 'success' not as how much he can frighten his audience, but if he can send them stumbling to their cars with a massive migraine.Though I could go on about how the acting is unbalanced and the film apes ""The Shining"" at every turn and the ghosts look like rejected Samaras, I'd much rather criticize the token sadistic scene included in this Bay-produced outing, as the TCM remake also possessed a scene that served no function to the plot, and was not as scary as it was gratuitous (where R. Lee Ermey coerces a kid into reenacting a suicide). Here, we have the increasingly 'insane' Reynolds chopping firewood with an ax, as one of his wife's (Melissa George) disagreeable children holds the lumber vertically, each chop coming closer and closer to taking off a limb (pardon the pun). Of course, this scene could be intended as an example of this man's distorted psyche, but again it's unsubtle and unnecessary and less scary than it is gratuitously sadistic. While I'm on the subject of what passes for 'entertainment' in this grimy remake, the sexpot/pedophiliac babysitter was another tasteless, uncomfortable addition to an already-excessive film.Even with this long laundry list of criticisms, ""Amityville 2005"" is at least better than the 1979 version.

61,a_chinn,Terrible remake of an iconic (though also bad) horror classic,3,29 April 2018,"Bad remake that's even worse than bad original film. I really did want to like this remake. The original film is iconic, even if it's wildly overrated, is a laughably bad horror film. I'm a HUGE fan of the Platinum Dunes remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" which was an excellent remake of a legitimate horror classic, so when I saw they were tackling a remake of ""The Amityville Horror,"" I figured it would be easier to do a improved version of a bad film than to try and redo a classic. This would be chance to fix all the bad elements of the original and to make an actually frightening ""Based on a true story"" haunted house movie. Instead, this remake takes far too many cues from the original and doesn't do them well at all. The remake does boast better special effects, some Grudge-like ghosts, and some Hellraiser-like gore, but really to very little effect. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George play George and Kathy Lutz, the unfortunately new owners of the infamous Amityville murder house. Both give sincere performances, but the Reynolds' demonic possession that turns him into an evil dad comes off just as badly as it did when James Brolin did it in 1979. Of novelty value, Chloë Grace Moretz makes her film debut as one of the Lutz children, but I'm going to stick prior opinion that ""Amityville 3D,"" directed by Hollywood veteran Richard Fleisher, remains the best of the Amityville series, even with it's PG rating.",The Amityville Horror

63,onepotato2,pathetic on any terms,1,21 April 2010,"Amityville Horror is some kind of stupid movie. It sprinkles water on a garden of clichés hoping they will come up roses (or cashcows) and nothing emerges from the manure... but the manure does get shinier. And hey, guess what? The ghost needs closure... the house had a murder in it... the deceased toddler disappears over edits and after shock reflections in medicine chests ....The casting is insipid. The Lutzes were apparently 99th percentile Alpha male and alpha female. Miserable Ryan Reynolds (who only has two modes; nasty snark, and ""I'm hot"" both of which undermine the movie) is completely miscast. They landed him within a year of his bodacious torso development, and they want to show off their coup. So he's shirtless as much as possible. What do naked studs have to do with 'horror?' Nothing. Except for making this the most homoerotic scary movie ever. You couldn't dig up a fresh idea in this tired malarkey if you watched it with an undertaker.

Think of Green Lantern and Blade 3. We're back in 1979, I think, and in good old Amityville, N.Y., as the Lutz family buys a house with a tragic past. Unlike the original however, the Lutzes here move into a veritable fun house, full of scary faces and loud noises, with more than a bit of The Shining woven into the plot. Reynolds never convinces as a dad who goes off the deep end, and the few scares are cheap. Melissa George is a hottie, very reminiscent of the hot British actress from Straw Dogs, but this movie is beneath her. Check her out in 30 Days of Night instead. The low point of this tired effort has to be the killing of the dog. Totally gratuitous. Interestingly, the film made a ton of money.

65,nycritic,Hothouse Horror,5,5 May 2006,"Who'd ever think that horror movies were the new erotica? In this new version of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, the house gets a face-lift and looks gorgeous amidst those lush trees and that placid lake, but when Ryan Reynolds takes his shirt off and reveals a ""whole lotta man"", well... needless to say, I suddenly felt like a giddy schoolgirl squealing in my sofa, and more than once my fingers couldn't resist and press the slow scan.So the moral is this: for those who still believe in the horror genre, please do not make it ""sexy"". It's like insider trading, or telling the viewer what happened to poor Marion in the shower in a little known slasher film from 1960. It just completely sabotages the purpose, which is to care about these people, to go through their pain, to hate the evil meanies even more, and to rave and cheer when the good guys win and the bad guys lose.Now, let's see: since I'm supposed to be ""reviewing"" this movie, what did I find about it? A breezier plot that at times looked a lot like a compressed version of the book form of ""The Shining."" Not strong on scare tactics. The ever-present sudden whooshes that indicate something horrible is close-by, formulaic and worn out. That nuisance of a dead girl, giving this movie its requisite nod to creepy Asian flicks, all which have an evil little child trying to wreck havoc on unsuspecting characters, goes with today's style but is unoriginal. In short -- this is Amityville-lite for anyone who doesn't want to watch the original, itself a rather bland rip-off of the haunted house genre and purportedly based on facts.",The Amityville Horror
66,raulfaust,Bring the action,7,30 July 2013,"Well, I believe lots of people already said what I'm about to, but I'm writing this review anyways. In my opinion, this movie in particular has many similarity with 1980's ""The Shining"": the dad going crazy, house in the middle of nowhere, a past guy that suffered from the same problem and so on. Ryan Reynolds and director make it very strong and plausible, considering these two professionals bring the elements an horror movie needs. For instance, Reynold's character making that angry expression all the time and director building a suspenseful atmosphere. Sometimes the movie feels fake because his family could just run away when he was sleeping, but, on the other hand, we can imagine the woman wouldn't like to leave her family like that. The axe scene is sadly a stolen element from ""The Shining"", even thought the scenes aren't exactly the same. Also, I believe Ryan Reynolds didn't need to show his fitness body all the time-- it's boring and doesn't have anything related to the movie itself. Unlike some others said, I think this movie has the perfect length, which isn't too short or too long. It scares and makes you scream occasionally, be careful.

Ryan Reynolds played his role pretty well, and he was believable as his character gradually changes over the course of the move. Melissa George was just gorgeous, as usual. Fans of hers will enjoy a one scene, in particular.  I haven't seen the original Amityville Horror, so I can't compare the two.

68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"One of the better horror remakes of the past decade, ""The Amityville Horror"" is still a tedious, over-made mess...",4,9 July 2012,"What is it with horror classics being remade recently? I'm not a pretentious geek by any means, and I'll concede that while unneeded, I am at least open to most remakes (or ""reboots""), and give them a fair shot. But they never get any better. And there's a particularly troubling sort-of condition associated with these films.I call it ""Blender Syndrome."" That is, the editors of most recent horror remakes seem way to overzealous in doing their job editing films, and seem to edit them by throwing the film-stock into a blender and turning it up to ""liquify."" That's the only logical explanation for why so many horror films, particularly these remakes, are choppy, fast messes that reek of over-editing. No shot lasts more than a second, and it's so darned distracting! I can never tell what's going on!Andrew Douglas directs the 2005 remake of the well-regarded original 70's haunted-house flick ""The Amityville Horror."" Based on an allegedly (and highly debated and oftentimes dismissed) ""true story"", the film follows the Lutz family- a man, his wife and her children from a previous marriage, as they move into the iconic Amityville House in Long Island, where only a year before, a young man went on a rampage and killed his whole family, claiming that he was possessed by evil spirits from within the house.They lasted for less than a month, and emerged from within telling stories about all sorts of paranormal activities that messed with their minds and bodies throughout their brief time there.This remake is more-or-less an amped-up, no-holds-barred, Saturday- Morning-Cartoon version of the original 70's film. It follows the same basic plot line and hits many of the same scenes, so it's no use in really reviewing the film and describing the plot. It's a continuous series of strange, otherworldly events that become more and more hostile towards the family. It's almost more like a clip-show-from-hell with some very slight through-lines of plot than an actual movie.The acting is surprisingly decent, and is one of the only good parts of the films. Ryan Reynolds, whom I sort-of love and hate depending on the role (sometimes he's great, sometimes he's tedious), is fantastic as George Lutz. Melissa George brings a lot of emotion to her role as Kathy, and serves as a nice motherly figure. The child-actors who play the children are also surprisingly strong.The production design and cinematography is also great, and the film looks gorgeous from a behind-the-scenes kind of perspective. And while it's mostly just moody clashes and chords, the score is fairly jarring and scary.But what really kills the film for me is the big three- the writing, the direction and the editing.First off, the script is fairly weak. The characters are given almost no development throughout the film. And there's exceedingly little breathing-room between the scare-scenes, making the film feel cluttered and like the bi-product of really bad studio interference. The direction is also kind of problematic. The thing is- there's a lot that director Douglas does right when it comes to direction. Some of the scenes are shot very well, and often he has really good choice in angles, movement and composition. The problem arrives when he goes into ""music video"" mode with stylized shots. Jarring, shaky closeups, over- lit shots that look to manufactured, over-use of slow motion, etc. It just doesn't work with haunted-house films like this to use these music- video style shots. (Although I'd be willing to bet that's more producer Michael Bay's fault than his) Although with some work, I think Douglas could prove to be a good director someday.Finally, as I mentioned above, there's the editing. It's quick. Too quick. It makes no sense half the time. Films do not need to have 20 cuts for every minute of footage to keep out attention. Please stop this, Hollywood.There's also a really bad habit that carried over into some other horror remakes, including the abysmal 2010 ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" reboot, which came from the same producers as this- the jump scares that seem to happen in EVERY... SINGLE... SCENE. These are so lazily thrown into the script in an attempt to be scary that it becomes funny, because you can see them coming.Overall, ""The Amityville Horror"" remake is not all bad. Some scenes are good, the acting is great and the visual artistry is off the charts. But it's over-directed, over-edited and under-written, leaving it feeling more like a Saturday-Morning Cartoon than a film. I give it a slightly below-average 4 out of 10. It's worth checking out once for fans, but most people can skip it.",The Amityville Horror

Gladly the remake isn't all bad, in fact it's a pretty good run of the mill supernatural horror. In 1974 a family of six were brutally murdered in their home, one year later a young couple and their 2 children move in and the movie follows the next 28 days in their new home.The movie carries a decent sense of threat throughout, and Ryan Reynolds portrays his characters insanity/possession very well. The problem is the lack of reasoning the family seems to have, from the time they moved in, they should have left the house and cut their loses; based on true events or not the idiocy of staying in the house is just too unbelievable to empathise with.Not a total waste of time, and it does entertain, but don't want for too much.6/10",The Amityville Horror
71,Screen_Blitz,"The Amityville Horror has returned, but without the scares and thrills",4,11 August 2016,"Yet another remake of a classic horror film has uprooted from the Hollywood assembly line, and like most remakes of this genre (or genre for that matter); it falls short of the freshness that made the original a cinematic hit. Based on the 1979 original that was inspired by the infamous true events of the 1974 murder of DeFeo family, the film boasts a re-imagining of the fateful events that took place following the notorious murder, but find itself plagued in a tedious wasteland of abortive scares and cheap thrills that never quite land, at least until the final fifteen minutes. In the end, it more than likely brings you the conclusion that the 1979 horror classic would have been better left alone. Directed by Andrew Douglas, the film follows George (played by Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (played by Melissa George), a couple three children including the eldest Billy (played by Jesse James), the middle child Michael (played by Jimmy Bennett), and the youngest Chelsea (played by Chloe Grace Moretz). The New York family moves into an old house marked for sale, despite being warned the grisly murders of a family that took place the following year. While adjusting to the new home life, the family experiences some demonic forces that put their lives in danger, Chelsea begins communicating with Jodie, one of the murder victims, and George gradually descends into cruel, abusive demeanor. Before they know it, the family finds themselves plagued by the evil forces of the dead family.It is in my sad duty is say this movie fails to deliver what is expected, nor does it bring anything new to the table. While Ryan Reynolds manages to come up with an appropriately eerie performance, the fine actor feels a bit miscast as the husband and father who becomes robbed of his mental health. Considering the other roles of his career, you would expect the filmmakers would have went with a better casting choice. Though his performance doesn't quite flounder, it's not enough to save the movie from the underwhelming horror fare that defines it. During these 90 minutes, viewers are forced to spend the majority of the time through tiresome jump scares and images of ghostly figures we've seen more than enough times. And this occurs so many times through the film, it grows stale pretty quick. The ghost of Jodie the younger child begins communicating with is scary-looking, but does very little to add to the scare factor. The supposedly most scary element in the film centers on George Lutz's descent into hostility as he develops a more cruel and abusive attitude towards his wife and children, and for awhile his wife somehow manages to put up with his mean-spirited attitude. Literally, it's not until the final fifteen minutes when she finally responds his transformation. This all leads to a climatic axe chase that is quite tense and surprisingly scary, but feels awfully derivative to the final scene in Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. Other than this, the rest of the movie feels soullessly wasted.The Amityville Horror is just another addition to the collection of dull horror remakes Hollywood has provided, and makes for a shamefully forgettable experience. While it may succeed in the acting department, the overall scare factor remains shallow and little to be desired. For those who decide to watch this, don't expect anything impressive.",The Amityville Horror

73,BrandtSponseller,"Decent enough for Amityville and haunted house film fans, otherwise approach with caution",8,25 April 2005,"A remake of the film by the same name from 1979, which was based on Jay Anson's book about a supposedly ""true"" haunting, Amityville Horror begins in familiar territory by showing us Ronald DeFeo, Jr. (Brendan Donaldson) murdering his family. A year later, newlyweds George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), with three kids from her previous marriage in tow, buy the vacant house at a steal, although they hesitate a bit once they learn why it's so cheap. Strange occurrences begin not long after they settle in. George becomes increasingly impatient and hostile, daughter Chelsea (Chloe Moretz) begins seeing the dead DeFeo girl, and so on. The film recounts their very brief but tumultuous stay at the home the Lutz's believed would be their dream home, but which turned into a nightmare.After seeing the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), which had the same production team, principal scriptwriter and visual effects team, and which I loved--I gave it a 10--I was completely psyched for the Amityville Horror remake. After all, unlike my view of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), which I also gave a 10, I think the 1979 Amityville has more than its share of problems. I like the original in spite of that, but producer Michael Bay and crew had plenty of opportunity for improvement. Unfortunately, although some aspects of this remake are better in my view, it suffers from a host of new problems. Like the first, the assets are good enough to transcend the flaws so that it squeaks by with a very low ""B"", or an 8.In my view, there are two primary problems, with at least one a bit ineffable. The more effable problem is that relative newcomer director Andrew Douglas (his previous effort was 2003's relatively little-known documentary Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus) instructs cinematographer Peter Lyons Collister to shoot the film using way too much close framing. I repeatedly felt the urge to take a couple steps back so I could better discern the action, the settings, the staging of scenes, and so on.The second problem lies more in the realm of writing and editing--the film just doesn't seem to flow right. The transition from scene to scene often feels almost arbitrary. Even though Reynolds does a great job in his transformation as George Lutz (and the acting is superb all around), there was a sense of buildup in the original that this remake is missing. Further indicative of the transition problems, although seemingly minor, is the fact that the date, or the day of the Lutz' stay at the home, is sometimes given as a title and sometimes not. It seems like they just forgot to add the day titles for half of the scenes. Overall the final cut gives an impression of being hastily put together.And that's a shame, because there is a lot of potential here. The house itself is impressive, as it needs to be, and the overall style of the film is nicely atmospheric. I was also impressed with the production design by Jennifer Williams, which among other assets tends to have the period setting spot-on. For example, I was a huge Kiss, Alice Cooper, etc. fan during this era (and I'm still a fan). Williams has a number of Kiss and Cooper images in the film. She very carefully ensures that none are anachronistic. Even though scriptwriter Scott Kosar disappointingly expressed a lack of enthusiasm for Anson's book and the original film, he reintroduces a number of elements from the book that work well, but which were left out of the original film. He also introduces new scenarios that in some cases are among the best material of the film--such as a breathtaking sequence on the roof of the home, and the extension of the mythology behind the ""haunting"". He also greatly improves on sequences such as the babysitter. But on the other hand, he inexplicably changes core elements of the story, like the kind of being that Jody is.Anyone frustrated with the typical horror style of the later 1990s and early 2000s may find this remake troublesome. As one might expect with Michael Bay producing, Douglas is encouraged to use ""MTV-styled"" cinematography and editing. There are a number of extended techniques that have become somewhat clichéd in recent years. Douglas has characters do that fast headshaking movement ala Jacob's Ladder (1990). There are sections shot in a cinema vérité style. There are instances of quickly changing film stocks and processing methods, and so on. Even though I usually love all of that stuff, and I'm actually a fan of Bay's work, I have to agree that it's not exactly the most natural fit in this case. But for me, it's not something I would subtract points for either.Maybe the most surprising fact is that this version of Amityville Horror is so close, structurally, to the original. There is nothing here that is a big surprise, and anyone who has seen the 1979 film a number of times will know exactly what's coming next, or close enough to it. Whether this is positive or not depends on your opinion of the original film, and just how highly you cherish originality for its own sake. Big Amityville fans and big haunted house film fans will probably enjoy the film enough. Everyone else should approach with more caution.",The Amityville Horror

Anyway, they do come across as pretty dense.And so does this big empty shell of a movie - a far worse ""re-imagining"" than Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" ever was, in part because even Burton at his worst still has more talent in his hair than Michael Bay has in his entire body (granted, Bay only produced the movie - and has ""in association with"" credit for presenting it with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Dimension Films - but he's just as culpable as director Andrew Douglas and screenwriter Scott Kosar). With Leo, Dimension, Platinum Dunes, Radar Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox (who released it in the UK) there are five corporate logos before the movie starts, which is about four more than the total number of real chills to be had; the movie's plot also diverges from the book and the first movie (why is there a ghost of the last person to be killed hanging around the house? Why not the whole family? And what's with the place being on the grounds of a psycho from olden days being into torturing Indians?), with little gained from the changes.The movie's hysterical but dull, with gruesome images and frenzied editing at every turn but nothing to truly connect you to what's going on, and a bad score by Steve Jablonsky doesn't help at all; casting problems aside (the parents look more like their children's big brother and sister than parents), Ryan Reynolds does at least come off better than Melissa George (who, nice though her body is, is just as useless here as she was on ""Alias""), but ultimately it's hard not to wonder why they can't just make a movie about the events leading up to the original slaughter rather than what came from the (there's no way around this) exploitation of the gruesome events. It might be more interesting, and certainly less questionable. And we'd also get an actual buildup and a genuine ending - the movie just seems to stop rather than climax. This is not a good way for MGM to go out on before becoming part of Sony. Not at all.That said, the movie does at least go for a 1970s feel, and Rachel Nichols livens things up as the world's worst babysitter (her wardrobe is a tipoff) - her scenes also lead into the one genuinely creepy moment in the movie, when she gets trapped in the closet with the spectre of the little girl and winds up going mad.

78,MihaiSorinToma,A good horror movie,8,8 September 2017,"A family gets murdered in the Amityville manor after demonic forces possessed one of its children, forcing him to kill them all, in their sleep, 28 days after they had moved in. One year later, another family, buys the same house at an incredibly cheap price and moves in with its three children. Weird things start to occur to all of its members, from strange behaviors to seeing people. The demonic presence starts taking control, ripping the whole family apart. Even the local priest can't do anything as he gets attacked and thrown out of the house. It's almost 28 days after they've moved in. Can they avoid repeating the history and not get murdered, or is it already too late?It's a terrifying movie, disturbing actually. You have to be strong to watch this movie. It will bring fear into your heart through the way it presents how a demonic spirit can possess and destroy a family without breaking a sweat. It's almost like a documentary, a great horror movie especially for the genre fans, with a story inspired from reality that is well put together. Although I don't like horrors, this one caught my attention!",The Amityville Horror
79,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Not bad, but not great",7,2 November 2006,"The Lutz family makes a big decision and decides to buy a new house. Things aren't that simple within the family as George is Kathy's second husband and his step-kids have yet to fully accept him. However, that becomes a much smaller problem when supernatural things begin to occur and these phenomena - dreams, apparitions, etc... - become increasingly hostile. This increases family tensions as well as psychological tensions when George begins to think he has to kill his family... which is the fate the previous family living in the house suffered.The only real truly convincing piece of horror with this film is that is is based on a true story. With that in mind the film can creep you out well enough to make it an enjoyable horror flick to catch at night. The other thing is that the movie was made as an R-rated horror film and that spares the viewer yet another wave from the plethora of cheesy PG-13 rated horror films that have been coming out - most of which have been remakes themselves, but of foreign R-rated films. The Ring, The Grudge, Pulse and so on.Here the grim tone and some gory imagery really makes the atmosphere ripe for a decent horror flick. But overall this is nowhere near being a great horror film. A truly funny thing is Ryan Reynolds as the working class dad sporting the same chiseled physique that he had in his superhero role in Blade: Trinity. Also while the horror bits are pretty well done, there seems to be a monotony to them all. The reactions of the characters are slow and they seem to hardly take interest in what is plaguing them until the very end of the movie. And I mean the very end. Also and sort of catharsis is brushed off to quickly and that makes for a partially incomplete feeling at the end.However, in light of The Grudge 2 and Pulse this should please horror fans fair enough. 7/10Rated R for violence/horror images and profanity",The Amityville Horror
80,mario_c,It's a new version which is more suspenseful but less accurate.,6,21 January 2008,"The new version THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, directed by Michael Bay in 2005, is quite different from the original. In fact it's not a straight remake because it has some new elements in the plot. First of all it's more fictional and doesn't follow so close the supposed true story of the Lutz family, as the original did. The fictional elements start with the fake inclusion of the little girl Jodie in the DeFeo's family. As the original movie describes, this girl was just an illusion created by the youngest child of the Lutz family. She never existed, as this remake induces to Other fictional element is the isolation of the house. As far as I learned it's located in a neighbourhood and it's not isolated. This remake proposes an alternative plot to the events and creates a more lunatic and almost killer GEORGE LUTZ. In fact, in this film, GEORGE LUTZ passes through the same experience that RONALD DEFEO did, hearing voices to kill his family. What he almost does! JODIE also assumes a more relevant influence, provoking the little CHELSEA almost commit suicide! The plot has a different structure; some characters are eliminated but new developments are introduced. I think it's more suspenseful than the original and gets a better climax (for what contributes the fictional elements!). Though it has plenty of nowadays horror flicks' clichés: the whispering voices; the flashback scenes; the ghosts with decayed bodies; the flashing lights, etc. They are all there! I think it's more suspenseful and entertaining than the original, but it's more fictional, less accurate and even more clichéd. So, I will score it 6/10 too.",The Amityville Horror

82,deatman9,not very good,5,19 October 2012,I actually only saw this movie for the first time the other night and I was not impressed. The acting was done well and its an interesting story but it just was not scary or thrilling at all. They should have added more scary elements to it i feel.This movie is about a young family who move into a new house. Unknown to them a bunch of gruesome murders took place in the very house they bought several years before. As they try to settle in weird things start happening to the father.This movie was not all bad I mean Ryan Reynolds did a surprisingly good job in this one definitely playing outside his comfort zone.

83,Superunknovvn,How to completely mess up the third act,6,14 May 2005,"When it comes to horror, I have learned to degrade my aspirations. Regardless of what could be done in a genre that has no boundaries theoretically, I'm already satisfied if a movie manages to make me jump every now and then these days. In the first two thirds ""The Amityville Horror"" delivers just that, fast pacing and some pretty effective jumps by using some cheap shock effects. Since this is a remake it is forgivable that it doesn't come up with anything remotely new or original. There's the ever so familiar haunted house, Dad losing his mind, heads shaking à la Jacob's Ladder, weird shadows moving fast and making insect sounds and the more than overused spooky little girl (really, having such a kid in another horror movie is idiotic and didn't even make much sense in this particular movie). Still, all that makes for an uneasy atmosphere and there's one scene in the bathroom that's set up gloriously, toying cleverly with a classic childhood fear (going to the toilet in the middle of the night in a dark and spooky house).So far the movie would get a straight 7 from me. Then somebody decided to add a background story, an explanation that's so silly and underdeveloped, it virtually ruined the whole movie (Ketchem, my ass). Characters start to act all weird (Kathy Lutz is a bit too patient with her raging husband, the kids go back and forth from being close to madness to feeling very comfortable in the house, Kathy continues to ask Father whatshisname for advice after he has run away from the house crying like a girl), which makes the whole third act seem as if it had been rewritten more than once and then edited into a mess. That's more than a tiny flaw and it keeps the movie from being anything better than a 6.",The Amityville Horror

And the main character's relationship with his children (one of which is played by a very young Chloe Grace Moretz) and his development is moderately interesting if poorly handled.

86,OriginalMovieBuff21,Definitely not like The Shining but it was a decent horror flick,6,30 October 2005,"I compare The Amityville Horror a lot to The Shining because their basically the same thing. The family moves in the big house, things start happening, family freaks out, the husband's the only one calm, he wants to stay, the rest of the family all freak out and he goes insane, and then things start happening again. I know it's based on a true story, but it is way too similar to The Shining and I know not all of what Amityville the movie is true like it tries to be. But besides that, the movie was decent and got me pretty good scares and a few jumps. The acting was okay, at least better than most horror movies in that category. Overall, it was a pretty good horror flick before Halloween but is very forgettable. I recommend it, if you want a few scares before Halloween.Hedeen's Outlook: 6/10 ** C-",The Amityville Horror
87,Antagonisten,"This is not scary, just annoying",2,3 September 2005,"I have not seen the original ""Amityville""-movie from 1979, which i feel today is probably just as well. After all that movie is considered a classic, and this remake is about as far away from a classic as it's possible to get.I don't know what it is with Hollywood and horror movies. I have thought about it for quite some time now. I have seen a lot of horror movies lately and almost all of them have been awful. I had hardly had time to recover from the awful ""Skeleton Key"" before this heap of dung fell into my lap. Not only is this movie completely lacking when it comes to originality, it's also a horror movie like it would be if it was made by a child with ADD.The story about the house that is evil and compels people to murder when they move in could have worked in my opinion. Of course we have seen it before since it's a remake, but it's a solid concept. The problem here is that director Andrew Douglas has absolutely no idea how to make a horror movie. The movie actually begins quite tolerably, but it doesn't stay that way for long. As soon as the creepy stuff begins it's 100% full speed ahead from there. Ghosts sit in every corner, the house constantly whispers about murder and strange shapes and shadows lurk everywhere. Douglas should do himself a favor and look up the word ""subtlety"" in a dictionary.The thing is though that even if he would have relaxed a bit with the effects this would still have been crap. What Hollywood doesn't understand is what made the originals of movies like this one and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" popular. Was it the effects (NO!), the plot (NO!) or the acting (GOD NO!)? No, it was the fact that people were actually watching something they had never seen before! A movie where they couldn't predict the next scene every time! And that's what i want to see, that's what's scary! Not this formulaic ""Horror Movie 1A"" crap on speed. This is not scary, just annoying. And i rate it 2/10, still considering myself to be generous.",The Amityville Horror

The oldest son, Ronald DeFeo Jr. confesses to police that he heard voices from the house, and he was ordered to kill all 6 family members. A year later, the house is sold to George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) for a cheap price. They ask why so cheap, and they were told that the DeFeo family was murdered in the house. George tells his wife that houses don't kill, people do. So they move in with their three children and start a new life. Unfortunately, their dream house becomes a nightmare. George begins to hear voices and the process starts all over again. The longer they are in the house, the worse it gets, and everything comes to a climax on the 28th day.This was a movie remake that was pretty good. Even though I saw the original movie and knew what was coming, I did jump out of my seat a few times. For a horror movie, it will put a chill up your back.

Their travels lead them to a quaint little village in Amityville, New York. Amityville is a nice upper middle-class area that would normally be out of the Lutzes price range, but a ""certain"" house for some reason is an absolute steal and a nightmare.err dream come true. It seems that the previous family hit a bit of a snag when the oldest son murdered the whole family in their sleep. ""High Hopes"" indeed. Well stuff starts to happen and their lives and that of Kathy's kids from a previous marriage spin into some serious satanic-flavored problems. Ghosts, black slime, phantom voices and botched blessings for starters.Amityville 2005 is brought to us by the producers of the Texas Chainsaw Redux. I thought they hit a solid homer with Chainsaw so I gave them the benefit of the doubt on this one; unfortunately what they serve up is a mixed bag at best. The original Amityville is a solid but under-realized film that could have been reworked into a much better film. But Amityville 2005 does some unnecessary retooling of incidents and basically turns itself into a reimagining of both the book and the original film. The acting (which I thought was a bit uneven in the first one) isn't any better here. Reynolds seemed a bit weak when George starts his descent into madness, which is the central theme to the film. George plays her part well and the child actors pretty much steal all their scenes. The direction was a bit uneven. A lot of shaky camera-work to express mount on screen tension got to be annoying at times. There are several good sequences scattered through the film. Many of the sequences are of they boo and shocking music variety, while these cheap tactics can be expected, it pretty much ruins what fairly nonexistent tension there was. The music was not very good it didn't help the mood or atmosphere one bit, a glorified temp score that serves to make you jump. The gore was ramped up pretty well this time around but really did nothing for a haunted house movie. The plot differences are quite significant: including a variation on the DeFeo murders and the whole ending seemed rather unnecessary, true they did board up a plothole or two left over from Amityville 1979 (they tried to give a more solid explanation of Jody and what it was that was ""wrong"" with the house) but in the end they wander really far from all source material. Was the story real or an elaborate hoax? You be the judge, but one thing is certain, the tale is interesting and has taken on a life all its own.",The Amityville Horror

They soon start to realize that there are sinister forces at work in their new house and that they may soon be the next 'pervious' owners.The Amityville Horror 2005 is a well-directed and rather gripping little ghost flick. It keeps the premise of the original film, but wisely makes a new and exciting plot of its own, although it does keep some scenes that are reminiscent of those in the original film. The new version has plenty of action, suspense, nightmarish imagery, and far more gore than the original film. Amityville 2005 is a rare re-imagining whose adding of more modern horror conventions and special FX actually makes the newer version more entertaining! Only complaint: I'm not quite sure it's REALLY 1975 though.The stars may be younger than those of the original film, but they prove to be worthy in their performances. Heart-throb Ryan Reynolds does a likable character who turns to become a scary villain. Melissa George is genuine and beautiful as Reynold's concerned wife. Also good are the performances of the younger cast members. Jesse James is solid as George's eldest son, while Jimmy Bennett and Chloe Moretz make convincing roles.All around, this remake is an enjoyable and occasionally shocking horror film.

91,MichaelMargetis,The Crappyville Whorer,4,23 April 2005,"I was expecting 'Amityville Horror' (the remake the the creepy 70's flick starring James Brolin based on the supposed true events) to be god awful. I mean, horror films today are nothing compared to what they used to be. It's all about effect and camera angles now, and not about decent plot and true terror. Now days, it doesn't matter if a horror film makes sense or not, just that it has weird camera shots, bizarre happenings and a lot of cheap shots. They call them cheap shots because the filmmaker is too uncreative to come up with real elaborate and original ways to scare people. Although 'Amityville Horror' wasn't quite as bad as I predicted, it wasn't no spring chicken either.The film takes place somewhere in the mid to late 70s. It's about a family consisting of a mother, Kathy Lutz (Melissa George), three children Michael, Billy and Chelsea Lutz, and the mother's new husband George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) who tries to be a step-father to the three kids since their dad died (of something we don't find out). Kathy is trying to be the best mother she can to her kids, and George is trying to help, although the kids try to keep a distance away from them. Trying their hardest to be a big happy normal family, the Lutzs buy an enormous historical home built in the 1600s for a very reasonable price (it's reasonable because some teenager killed his parents, and his three siblings with a hunting rifle because voices in the house told him to do it.) Of course, The Lutz's have no problem moving into a house where five people were brutally murdered by a guy who claimed to be influenced by evil spirits. I mean, I wouldn't have a problem moving into a house like this, it would seem to me like a happy home. Yeah right! Who the hell writes these freakin' horror movies? The family moves in and over the course of twenty-eight days strange and freaky stuff starts to go down, and George becomes possessed by the spirit of an demented 19th century Reverend who tortured and murdered Native Americans. Pretty far-fetched, huh?The remake to this not-so-good-to-begin-with original, is very scary but pointless too. Pretty much every actor in the film is terrible. The three children are absolutely dreadful, especially the eldest. Melissa George does an alright job as the heroine of the film, but Ryan Reynolds is surprisingly good as the laid back cool guy turned deranged child-abusive ax murdering psychopath. Probably the best performance of the film is Detective Bookman himself, Philip Baker Hall ('Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', most notably 'Seinfeld') as the town preacher that helps Kathy Lutz battle the curse of the haunted house. He does a great job with the very few screen time he has (He only has about ten minutes total in the film). The film conjures up some good scares, but most are done by cheap shots. The ending is confusing, oh god, so confusing. Don't even get me started on how illogical, unnecessary, unrealistic, sappy and frustrating that ending is. Andrew Douglas does an okay job directing (I wouldn't expect to see his career fly far). The writing is really jumbled and pretentious because it tries to come off as well thought out, when it is really something I could dribble out with a felt pen on some computer paper in an afternoon. The cinematography is confusing and annoying, and whoever edits the film should be fired (in a car scene they show the Lutz family pass the same car twice while driving straight.) All in all 'The Amityville Horror' isn't worth the price of admission or rental fare. Wait till this is on one late night on HBO in the next two years. But if you decide to go check it out in the theaters, don't say I didn't warn you. Go see 'Sin City' or 'Downfall' instead. 'Amityville Horror' is just another disappointing horror flick that seems to be more common and expected then it should be.

95,ofumalow,And the Oscar goes to...Ryan Reynolds' personal trainer.,2,12 April 2005,"Because his upper-body definition--very frequently bared here despite the fact that his character keeps complaining how cold he is--rates as the only really amazing ""effect"" in possibly the worst horror remake of late. Never mind that nobody looked like that in the 1970s (still this story's ostensible setting); it's an inspiration. I'm going carb-free as of five minutes ago.That aside, nuevo ""Amityville"" is just another movie that plays like one long highlight reel--all sledgehammer ""shock"" climaxes that have no impact because they get no buildup. There's no atmosphere, no character development, and precious little attention to behavioral logic. Instead, there's just a series of shock cuts and absurd ""perils"" that, like an irksome little bro sneaking up on you to scream ""Boo!,"" are annoying at first. Then with repetition, they get...really annoying. I don't care if this version is or isn't ""faithful"" to the ""true"" original story. Come ON. I just wanted something scary. But this film is so dumbed-down for maximum goosing value that it shoots itself in the foot. It plays like a trash-compacted ""The Shining"" minus any directorial personality, gallows humor or genuine creepiness. Maybe someday the director will come out and say that the studio took the final cut away from him--that would make sense (or at least make him look better), because the barely-80-minutes of actual narrative screen time feel like they were edited within a millimeter of total incoherence. Fast pacing is one thing. This is the kind of pacing that suggests either a very low opinion of the audience's attention span, or an attempt to simply blast through footage that the producers considered almost unsalvagable. I never thought I'd be saying ""the original was better"" in this case--because really, that movie sucked, too. (Some movies become ""classics"" only because they never stop playing on TV.)

97,Gafke,Yet another unnecessary remake,3,16 April 2005,"Loosely based on the book by Jay Anson, this remake of the 1979 film (which starred Margot Kidder and James Brolin) is the allegedly true story of the Lutz family, who move into a beautiful, affordable house where, a year earlier, a disturbed young man had slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun. Dubious at first, George and Kathy move in along with Kathy's three children from a previous marriage. It doesn't take long for the horror of Amityville to make itself known to the Lutz's. Whispery voices drift through the ventilation system, George begins to have trouble sleeping and Chelsea, the young daughter, begins conversing with an imaginary friend named Jody. A slutty, pothead babysitter gleefully relates the story of the shotgun slayings to the children one night and winds up locked in a closet with Chelsea's ""imaginary"" friend Jody, who looks like the worlds youngest goth girl. George begins to fall apart, hanging out in the basement and growing more and more irritable and menacing. Kathy, concerned for her children and frightened by George's inexplicable personality change, digs up the unsavory history of the house and realizes that time may be running out for she and her family. She has to get them away from the house, but she may already be too late.This film bears little resemblance to the original film, and even less to the actual case. People familiar with the facts surrounding the Amityville haunting may be irritated, or even outright disgusted by the liberties this version takes. The atmosphere of the film is genuinely creepy and tense, and a scene in a bathroom in the middle of the night actually made me jump and scream a few choice expletives. The film does venture into the realm of cheap scare tactics a few times too many, and suffers from some ""what the hell are they thinking?"" moments and a cheesy, one-last-BOO! ending. It cheapens the film somewhat, which is a shame. The gore and the jump-scares weren't really necessary, and I think the film could have been better if they'd concentrated on the genuine sense of dread they'd built up, instead of casting it aside for shock. The cast does pretty well, all things considered. Ryan Reynolds turns in an outstanding performance as George Lutz, easily shifting back and forth from loving husband and caring stepfather to whacked out, abusive bastard within seconds. He makes George Lutz a fascinating, frightening, sympathetic and also quite amusing character. All in all, this is a good effort. It's not the best ghost story I've ever seen, but it's not the worst either. 6 out of 10.",The Amityville Horror

I bet the director's favorite movies are ""Saw"" and ""The Butterfly Effect"", because style-wise, it's the same. It's another one of those movies that screams out to me, ""I am a movie made by people with no original ideas who are choosing to do an unnecessary remake in order to get the immediate support and funding in order to make it, due to the expected guarantee that it will make a decent amount of money at the box office"". Not really my cup of tea. Stop wasting our time when you could just as easily be making NEW movies to enjoy!!!!It's like this guy watched ""The Shining"" and ""The Omen"" right before putting this movie together and stole half the ideas from there. Not too thrilling or innovative. The original Amityville is far superior. And I like Amityville 2 even more personally. The cinematography is done well enough that average movie goers will be impressed. As for me, I guess Ryan Reynolds body will just have to keep me entertained.",The Amityville Horror
99,christian123,It's an improvement over the original but the remake is still only mediocre at best,4,17 January 2006,"In 1975, George and Kathy Lutz moved into their dream home in Amityville, Long Island, not realizing that a year earlier, a man named Ronald Defeo had killed his parents and siblings, claiming that voices told him to do so. Strange things start happening inside the house, causing the Lutzes to abandon the home after less than a month. Thirty years later, the true story is ready to be told.again.The original Amityville Horror wasn't very good to begin with and this update isn't much better. The original was a long and dull film with very few scares. The remake is much shorter yet it's still not very interesting. There are a few scares but nothing really new or clever. I also hate it when films are advertised as true stories when they're really not. The story was proved a hoax quite some time ago yet they kept pushing the ""based on a true story"" to attract extra viewers. It doesn't take away from the quality of the picture but it does annoy me a lot.Taking the James Brolin role is Ryan Reynolds. After being one of the few good things in Blade Trinity, Reynolds surprises again giving a good, solid performance. His costar Melissa George keeps up with him and she also gives a very good performance as well. The actors playing the kids are alright but not really that effective. Playing the worst babysitter in the world is Rachel Nichols. She gives an okay performance but doesn't appear much in the film.A small nitpick I had with the film, nothing major, is that it doesn't look like the 70s at all in the movie. The film is supposed to take place in 1975 yet they hardly tried to make it seem like that time period. I know it's nothing really important but it bothered me a little. The rest of the movie looks nice though. house is defiantly not one I would want to approach. I think Andrew Douglas did an okay job with this remake. He kept the film shorter and he was able to build up a few suspenseful scenes. However, I still didn't really like the film. It was an okay horror film but it was still not a satisfying experience. However, it was better than the original. In the end, if you're looking for a few scares then this film may fit the bill though approach with caution. Rating 5/10",The Amityville Horror
100,bh_tafe3,A modern adaptation of an average movie.,6,6 December 2008,"As a male I'll get the important thing out of the way first. Mellissa George is beautiful. Now if you're not an Australian in their mid twenties- early thirties you may be wondering about what all the fuss is about, but Aussie guys grew up watching the gorgeous Mellissa George as Angel on the Australian Soap Opera ""Home and Away,"" and she was and remains a complete babe.Having said that it's rather unfortunate that she continually finds herself in movies like this, cast as a piece of meat, with very little going for them.Having said that Amityville Horror is a decent film. It spends a lot of time building tension before finally getting to the big finish, and the big finish is frightening and effective, but the build up is rather draggy, with a lot of unnecessary stuff thrown in to make the running time a bit more respectable. Also of course, the directors realised, as I've stated, that Mellissa George is a babe and so couldn't't resist getting her to film a sex scene with Ryan Reynolds.The original Amityville Horror is an over rated movie which scored big because they were able to convince people it was based on real events. 20+ years on we know the story was a hoax and so it's just not as scary as the original was when it first came out.Ryan Reynolds puts in a moody, effective performance as George Lutz. Mellissa fares reasonably well as Kathy Lutz, but isn't playing the most interesting character, and young Jesse James is passable as our child in peril. But the story has no go forward, the plot plodding along in neutral and occasionally stalling, until the third act when we go straight into top gear with little warning.Not a bad little movie, and a lot better the second time around.

101,squeezebox,"First two thirds is great, last third just gets worse and worse",5,25 April 2005,"There are few things I find more frustrating than a movie that starts out great and then begins to fall apart as it comes to its end. THE AMITYVILLE HORROR has some good atmosphere, some great scares and mostly good performances for the first hour or so.Then the priest comes over and is attacked by a swarm of cartoon flies and the movie grinds to a halt. It seems obvious to me that another writer took over at this point, to make the movie more ""safely"" freaky and frightening. So we get a lot of the usual ""boos"" and creepy imagery, but the movie loses the eerie, malevolent atmosphere as it turns into yet another CGI-laden freakshow.Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George are very good as the young couple who have gotten in over their heads and find their lives unravelling. Phillip Baker Hall, a gifted character actor, seems so intent on not repeating the relentless scenery-chewing of Rod Steiger that his performance rarely goes above monotone whispering.I will not go into the ridiculous and moronic ending. Let's just say the filmmakers attempt to take the original movie's ending and ""spice it up"" to appeal to today's audience. I found myself rolling my eyes and chuckling in exasperation more than a few times in the movie's last ten minutes.Overall, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR is okay.

The Amityville Horror--a remake of the 1979 movie about a possessed house that torments the family that moves into it--tosses normalcy out the window in the first five minutes, unleashing a nonstop barrage of unsettling camera angles, decaying wood and stained wallpaper, half-glimpsed shadows in motion, fast edits of grotesque ghosts, and dozens of other horror-movie devices. Whether you like the movie will depend on whether you like feeling slightly nauseated and cut off from any semblance of reality--for many people, that's why they go to horror movies. Others won't be able to suspend disbelief that anyone but an actor would spend the time necessary to develop Ryan Reynold's insanely buff physique, prominently displayed as he runs around wearing nothing but a pair of loose-fitting pajama bottoms. In addition to Reynolds (Van Wilder, Blade: Trinity), the movie also features Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia) and Melissa George (Down With Love).",The Amityville Horror

104,shanfloyd,Now this one actually has scary moments.,7,24 June 2006,"""The Amityville Horror"" is not a classic horror film, definitely. I haven't seen the 1979 film it is based on, so I can't compare between the two. But from all I have seen, this film has actually enough spine-chilling moments. The total atmosphere is scary, the story suspenseful, the actors well enough and the cinematography is a hit.The basic plot is simple enough. A family buys a house where a few years ago a lunatic had killed several children. Now the ghosts are back to spook the family away. What made this story a winner is its no-nonsense dialogues, added family tension between the members and most of all, circumstances where the spirits made their appearances. This is helped a lot by the excellent cinematography, stylish editing and the background music. The ghost make-ups were not at all laughable (like I find in most of the recent horror films) and used quite smartly with sudden close shots and lightning effects in lighting.In my personal opinion Ryan Reynolds has pulled off another nice job. His character could have been better written though, showing a little more conflict when he was being 'possessed'. The child actors were okay, and so was Melissa George. There are certainly a few loopholes in the story and some unexplainable actions by the characters. But let's face it, you're not there to see a Nobel prize story... you're here to be scared. And this film promises you that... to a certain extent.",The Amityville Horror

Also James Brolin was more sinister than the wise cracking Ryan Reynolds. Scenes were more sinister in particulary the flies scene with the priest Rod Steiger. But you saw very little. In this remake the movie is much more interesting as you seen much more, the ghost child Jodie, the insanity materializing within George Lutz etc. Its visually displayed where as in the original its assumed.

However, I thought this was a solid horror film with a few good jump scares and a few inspired original sequences. The haunted house could have been creepier for me and didn't feel very atmospheric. A pet peeve of mine present here is how relatively intelligent people in horror movies do what they're told by supernatural agencies just because they're told to do so. Regarding performances, the mother was quite warm and believable. Ryan Reynolds the lead did pretty good for one of his first dramatic roles but unfortunately his sculpted perfect shaved physique detracted from the performance. I don't expect a building contractor to look like a male model or olympic swimming athlete. The kids were OK except the youngest one who seemed a bit fake like in those TV commercials.

110,willywants,You know you're in trouble when the DVD menus are scarier than the film itself!,4,16 October 2005,"This 2005 remake of the 1979 horror film has the same set-up, with the Lutz family moving into the Amityville house. Everyone's happy at first, but soon strange happenings occur and Mr. Lutz begins loosing his sanity. All this can be attributed to some horrific events that happened in the house's basement several hundred years before. The film begins well with likable performances from the two leads, Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, and there's a much-needed good sense of humor. Also present is a surprisingly fulfilling amount of gore, thank God, and the attempt to flesh-out the house's back-story was a nice touch as well. Things go way down hill from here as eye rolling clichés and incredibly cheap ""boo"" scares take center stage. Gone are any scenes of genuine creepiness that were in the original (The ""babysitter"" scenes in this version were a joke!) and the ghostswhich were quite similar to those found in the 2001 remake of ""Thirteen Ghosts""were not in the least bit scary. Even the score, from five (!) credited composers, was a disappointment. Jody, the demon pig (how cool is that?) from the original, has been replaced with a ghostly little girl, ala ""The Ring"". A shame, really, as there are a few good moments and first-time feature film director Andrew Douglas shows an impressive eye for the camera.

111,Toronto85,The Amityville Horror,7,4 March 2011,"Remakes usually stink. That isn't the case for The Amityville Horror. I wasn't a huge fan of the original 1979 version, so this 2005 remake is one I found to be a major upgrade and good addition to the lengthy series. It's the same story as the original with the Lutzes moving into the house where a family was murdered. Many strange things begin to happen and slowly the husband George (Ryan Reynolds) becomes possessed. Many of the scares were good in this one. I like the addition of Jody's spirit to the story. Jody was the little DeFeo child who was shot by her brother. She is very creepy and the scene with the babysitter in the closet is very well done. I also thought the scene with the young daughter walking on the roof of the house was chilling in a way.Ryan Reynolds does well in the role, he has some very witty one liners during his slow possession. Day by day, his character becomes a mean and hateful person because of the house. There are many changes from this one compared to the original. There isn't an overwhelming religious feeling to the movie. There is a priest, but he's in one or two scenes unlike Rod Stieger's character in the 1979 version who plays a big part. I thought this one was a bit better, it didn't move at a slow pace and really kept things interesting in every scene.I am not a believer of the ""true story"". Obviously the people who made this film aren't either. The book is obviously different from the 1979 version, but even more so in this one. But that's okay with me considering I never bought the story in the first place. Definitely check this out. After many mindless sequels in the 90's (although some were rather good), the series seems to be closed with this recommended remake.7/10",The Amityville Horror
112,rparham,A decent horror film,7,23 April 2005,"Thanks to the successes of the Scream and The Ring, horror movies are a very hot commodity in Hollywood right now, with the results being a mixed bag. The Amityville Horror, a remake of the late 1970's horror film, finds itself at the upper end of the spectrum: not quite great, but not bad either. It is an effective horror film with strong suspense and scares.Based on the non-fiction book by Jay Anson (the veracity of which has been brought into question over the years) and the film of the same name, The Amityville Horror opens in the mid-1970's in a New England home inhabited by the Defeo family. The eldest son, Ronald (Bredan Donaldson), living in the house's basement, suddenly kills his family one evening, apparently under the influence of an unseen force in the house. One year later, George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) and his new wife Kathy (Melissa George), decide to purchase the house because of its incredibly low price. Shortly after moving in with Kathy's children from her previous marriage to a now-dead husband, things quickly appear to not be entirely well with the house. Kathy's daughter, Chelsea (Chloe Moretz), has begun talking to an ""invisible"" friend, who is visible to the audience as the ghost of the Defeo daughter Jodie (Isabel Conner), George finds the temperature unbearably cold and takes to living in the basement, and everyone hears strange noises from the adjoining boathouse. As time progresses, George becomes more and more removed from the family and begins exhibiting signs of insanity, hearing voices and seeing things in the house.One of The Amityville Horror's strengths is its low-key nature, focusing on building suspense and paying off with some good shocks. The film isn't interested in reveling in blood and gore like many other horror films, but it isn't afraid to show us a little more detail than it's contemporary PG-13 brethren. Much like films such as The Ring, it tries to direct our attention to something in the frame and then not deliver the expected scare, but instead hold back a little longer and payoff in a more unexpected way. Director Andrew Douglas and cinematographer Peter Collister also shoot the film in a grainy, dark, style, helping to not make anything look too slick and keep most of the house in shadow at times.The actors are strong, especially Reynolds. Following his standout work in Blade: Trinity, Reynolds shows a great deal of range with the role of George, displaying the ability to be likable and then not likable in a short amount of time. It is his performance of a man slipping into insanity that helps sell the later portions of the film. The other actors in the film are all capable and create realistic characters.While it may not have quite the impact of The Ring, The Amityville Horror is more than sufficient in doing what it is supposed to be doing: delivering a scary night at the movies. What more can you ask?",The Amityville Horror
113,Mr_Censored,Solid ghost story that doesn't overstay it's welcome.,6,26 February 2009,"Kathy: ""Is this discipline or torture?"" George: ""I thought it was meatloaf."" Based on one of the most fraudulent ""true stories"" in history, ""The Amityville Horror"" attempts to re-create and re-package a poorly aged film from 1979 of the same name, this time casting Ryan Reynolds (""Waiting,"" ""Van Wilder"") and Melissa George (""30 Days Of Nights"") in the role of the Lutz family, who  despite receiving an education from their real estate agent  move their family into the very same home that Ronald DeFeo Jr. murdered his family in one year prior. The house is hardly a dream come true, however, as George (Reynolds) goes from Mr. Nice Guy to stereotypical bad step-father in under a day while ghosts play with the children and terrorize a baby-sitter who was too old for the job anyway.Directed by Andrew Douglas and produced by Platinum Dunes (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (2003)), this re-telling is surprisingly close to that of the original, and doesn't stray much except in the fact that it's paced a little better. Whereas the original film took forever to get to it's point  which wasn't all that captivating to begin with  this film knows it's audience. Surely this remake was inspired by the success of films like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" and it shows. It hits the ground running, wrapping itself up all nice and tidy in well under 90 minutes. Despite the fact that he has yet to make his mark on the genre, and the fact that he is working with weak and contrived material, Douglas knows how to deliver a good looking show that doesn't skimp on atmosphere and disturbing visuals (save for some bad C.G.I.). The film looks gorgeous and the mood is appropriately set for Ryan Reynolds to chew up the scenery. Maybe it's due to the fact that he normally plays a nice guy/funny man in other films, but his turn as the uber-abusive George Lutz is what makes the film. He plays the nice guy so well and makes you like him so much, that when he turns  and he turns badly  it's all the more engrossing. He pulls the role off surprisingly well (let's hope he's got more serious roles ahead of him) and it doesn't hurt that he's surrounded by a good cast. Melissa George plays the sympathetic role of the wife, and she plays it very real and very human. Likewise, the three kids are unusual to horror films in the fact that they aren't annoying, so that's much appreciated. Heck, even Philip Baker Hall has a turn as a priest who tries (and fails) to clean house.The film isn't without it's flaws, however. What it gains in momentum and pacing, it sorely lacks in suspense. The film can hardly settle on one moment long enough to be truly effective. It's a fun, easy and breezy watch for the average horror fan, but it lacks a whole lot of substance. If you've seen the original  and enough haunted house flicks  you know the score and you know how it's going to pan out. The film is pretty much devoid of the element of surprise, right down to it's ho-hum ending. In spite of that fact, though, it's still a solid little horror film. Certainly, one of the more tasteful remakes to a movie that actually needed it. It's worth watching for it's cast and for the doomy vibes it gives off, and  at the very least  it's more than a few notches above those ridiculous made-for-TV sequels of the 80's and the 90's.",The Amityville Horror
114,RockPortReview,A Rare Quality Re Make. See it!,7,3 December 2012,"""Houses don't kill people, people kill people"". The original 1979 movie starred James Brolin and Margot Kidder as a family that moves into a big beautiful house only to find it has a storied and brutal past. The movie is based on a true story of the most famous haunted house in America. The house itself is a very iconic image in the history of horror movies, almost like the mansion in ""Psycho"" The movies both old and new are based on the book ""The Amityville Horror"" by Jay Anson.Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George take on the lead roles of George and Kathy Lutz, while their little girl Chelsea is played by up and coming superstar Chloe Grace Moretz (""Kick-Ass"", ""Let Me In""). Taking place in 1974, George is a building contractor who is looking for a new house for his new instant family. Kathy is a widower with 3 kids so George must really find Kathy special. All kidding aside they find a giant house at a bargain price and wonder what the catch is. Well here it is, they are told a year earlier a family was brutally murdered after living there for 28 days. Things start out great for the family as they usually do, but things don't stay that way for long. George becomes more angry, more aggressive and begins to lose touch with reality. Is it the house or is he just in a little over his head with what's going on in his life? This movie also loads on the typical horror clichés. It has a cold and creepy basement, freaky kids up to no good, old priests who have lost their faith and get attacked by flies, you know the usual.Chelsea has a new imaginary friend in Jodie, who might not be all that imaginary (or alive for that matter) Kathy also starts to see and hear things. After witnessing the changes overcoming George she consults the local priest played by the great Phillip Baker Hall. We get a little more back story on the house, but the priest role is pretty underused. While in the house George feels physically ill and his mental state starts to quickly erode, until he finally loses it. I know this isn't the greatest movie, but for a horror remake it does the job and doesn't crap all over the original. Ryan Reynolds is known more for his comedic roles, but he is also a good dramatic actor (see ""Buried"").There are countless sequels and other ""Amityville"" horror movies but the original and this remake are the ones to watch.",The Amityville Horror
115,Rathko,"Bad, Not Terrible, But Bad.",3,8 February 2008,"The original 'The Amityville Horror' was a pretty generic haunted house movie, lifted to something reasonably entertaining by excellent performances from James Brolin and Margot Kidder. The remake manages to retain all the tedium of the original with none of the fun. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George simply don't have the talent to make the increasingly ridiculous situations remotely believable. Inexperienced director, Andrew Douglas, avoids the slow building tension of 'The Shining', which this movie so clearly apes, in favor of one cheap scare tactic after another. All the good character development stuff, the scenes that actually established them as a normal and loving family, ended up on the cutting room floor, as evidenced by the deleted scenes section of the DVD. The result is that we care nothing for the characters or what happens to them.The movie also raises questions about the ethics of using real people's names in fictional work. If I were George Lutz I'd be a little irritated that I was being depicted as a crazy guy killing my dog and chasing my family around with an axe. The movie takes even further liberties with the 'truth' than the original - the house, which was pretty standard suburban home built in the 1920s in a middle-class neighborhood, is turned into an isolated Colonial mansion; the vaguely spooky goings on reported by the Lutz's are turned into zombies and little girls who look like they stepped right in from a Japanese horror movie; the DeFeos are given a daughter they never had and the home is built on an ancient Indian torture chamberor something.Like screenwriter Scott Kosar's previous effort, 'The Texas Chainsaw massacre' remake, 'The Amityville Horror' takes place in the mid-1970s but does nothing to convey an authentic sense of time and place. Never for a moment do you think you're watching a story set 30 years ago.

In fact I was really looking forward to this movie. The original had actors with life, and was genuinely scary. This remake is dull, lifless and even confusing in parts. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say even the ending was not only anti-climatic but also didn't resolve everything. The father in this film was not nearly as convincing as the actor in the original, same for the mother.

118,ab-2,Bad Movie. Nuff Said,2,15 August 2005,"Remakes seem to be the big thing in Hollywood now. Every month, there seems to be a remake of a movie coming to theaters. I try to judge movies on their own merits rather than comparing to them to their originals. If you remember my review of Seed of Chucky, I quoted Pauline Kael as saying ""Movies are so rarely great art that if we cannot appreciate great trash we have very little reason to be interested in them."" Unfortunately there is always times where the trash really stinks and you just want to get rid of it anyway you can. Enter the film, The Amityville Horror.George (Ryan Reynolds) & Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) and Kathy's 3 children are moving into an elegant Long Island home for a reasonable price. The reason why is that 5 savage murders were committed there the year before by Ronald DeFeo Jr., son of a wealthy car dealer who murdered his parents, brothers & sister by shooting them in November 1974. No sooner when the Lutz's move into the house, they begin seeing horrible things - the ghost of Jody DeFeo, horribly disfigured bodies, and hearing ghostly voices throughout the house. George seems to notice it the most, and it isn't long before he becomes a danger to those around him.First I want to get this out of the way: This is NOT based on a true story. Both Ronald DeFeo and George and Kathy Lutz concocted this story for their own personal reasons. However, it is true that I wish I hadn't seen this movie. This is such a flawed movie, that not even a blessing from the Pope could save it. Since Michael Bay is attached as producer, you know there will be such wonderful bits of dialogue like ""There is no bad houses. Just bad people."" Go figure. I was also appalled and insulted by this movie's exploitive nature. There were at least 4 to 5 separate scenes with actor Ryan Reynolds without a shirt, yet the camera makes sure to film him from the top of his head to right below his abdomen to show off his manly and muscled physique. What was the purpose of this? That's right: it had no purpose except to appeal to the brain-dead audience members in the hopes of distracting them from this god awful ""script."" Let's go right into the reason we see horror movies: to be scared. This movie does not even come close in trying to be scary. It wants to be a cross between The Shining and The Haunting, and expectedly, miserably fails at both. Alfred Hitchcock once said ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it."" This movie bangs in your face so loudly that you wonder ""What the heck was that?"" That's what made The Shining and The Haunting so frightening, while you knew something was going to happen, you didn't know how or when. Even Helen Keller could've predicted this movie's ""scares"" from a mile away. Those silly, fast jump cuts and ""scary ghost is behind the character"" really didn't help that much either.As for the actors, they try their best with what they are given in the script and by the director. Ryan Reynolds is tolerable and does his split-personality scenes very well. Melissa George is just there honestly for eye candy. The kids are barely interesting as characters. The only person who seemed interesting at all was the babysitter played by Rachel Nichols who seems to be genuinely having fun with her role. The makeup by KNB Efx. is up to their usual great standard with their penchant for over-the-top blood and gore.I am not happy writing this review. Unlike with The Aviator, which I felt motivated to make sure people didn't see, I feel sick writing a review for a movie that I absolutely did not like. While there needs to be a great balance between seeing art and trash, no one should find time to see garbage such as The Amityville Horror.",The Amityville Horror

The sole release on tax day and the last wide release by the old regime at MGM, ""The Amityville Horror"" is an excursion into excess.While this is a somewhat enjoyable remake of a not so good movie, it is also a somewhat unnecessary remake of said movie.The story is the same, only the so-called scares of the original are turned up for the 21st century.Jettisoned are any possible references to the many sequels and while the original house burned down (after being moved), the movie does bring back the faux house with the evil eye-like exterior.Just for that classic moment both this and the original are average and possibly worth a view, but thats it.",The Amityville Horror
120,iago-6,"Same space, newly renovated",2,28 February 2006,"I watched the original of this movie a few weeks before this new one came out, and it was even worse and cheesier than I anticipated. I was hoping the remake would be fairly decent, and you have a the necessary element therei.e. creepy houseand I hoped that they would throw out a lot of the ""adherence to the facts"" that made the original such a bore and retool it to make it actually scary. But no. What's most disappointing about this movie is how, even though they changed the events, it remains pretty much the exact same movie, just turned up a notch.I was not bored or unentertained during the 90 minutes I spent in the theater, but for me, there's nothing here that's scary. What horror (the genre) has devolved into as it becomes more popularessentially a bunch of empty ""Boo!"" scaresjust isn't scary to me. But for a film to have an effect it has to have TIME to build an effect (not to mention atmosphere or thematic resonance) and this is not possible in a country that increasingly has no attention span. Here some face or creepy something appears on screen with a crashing noise every five minutes, lest anyone get ""bored."" But aren't you BORED with those idiotic scares? I won't go on too long here, as there's no point. If you like these kind of scares, you get what you deserve.Incredibly, there's not even any interest to be had in comparing the two versions.The only point of interest to the film is the way they've redesigned the house. They added an entire floor to the bottom that is a glassed-in porch (I was thinking ""Jeez and I never have time to wash my THREE windows""), which doesn't accomplish much and is used to no purpose, but it does make the house taller and narrower. The exteriors and the interiors do not really match, as they've made the house so tall and narrow to emphasize its scariness. The interiors are also designed to be unusually tall and narrow. This isn't much, but at least it's a kind of clever cinematic sleight-of-hand, and truly is the only clever thing about the entire film. It is most noticeable when the dippy little girl goes out on the roof for no other reason than that we need a sequence of peril; you can see that the roof is pitched at a very steep angle that doesn't match the interior at all. Whatever, at least they tried something somewhat interesting.On the last day the family spent in the house, the wife is at the library before it opens in the morning, does some research, visits the priest, but by the time she goes home (seemingly around noon) it is the dark of night, because the climax has to happen at night. Huh. Ghostly forces, I guess.Mildly entertaining, like cinematic potato chips, not scary, not interesting, devoid of subtext. The only interest this movie can drum up is the way it signifies one more beat in the continual death knell of the Horror film.Hey, there are lot of other reviews of bad and cheesy movies on my website, Cinema de Merde, which you can find through the URL in my email address.",The Amityville Horror
121,HorrorFan1984,The Amityville Horror (2005),8,22 March 2020,"Usually, I despise horror remakes. They typically bring nothing new to the game and are generally weaker than their original. This does not apply to the 2005 version of 'The Amityville Horror'.Like the original story told, this film follows the Lutz's and what they endured in the house a year after an entire family was murdered by the eldest child of that family. We are introduced to Kathy and George Lutz who buy the Amityville house for them and their three kids. Once they all move in, we get the typical Amityville scares that we're used to. Creepy basement, flickering lights, and creepy voices.George slowly begins to become possessed by the evil surrounding him in the house, it's urging him to kill his family. We also see some creepy imagery of the dead child Jody who was murdered in the house a year prior. This is most shown during a VERY well done scene when the babysitter comes over and is locked in a dark closet, forced to share the small space with a very deceased Jody. All of this leads to an ending that forces Kathy Lutz to battle evil and save her family from ultimately dying at the hands of her husband George.I really like this remake. It is such an improvement to the original 1979 film. We get way more scares for one thing. The original film only peaked in the door when it comes to onscreen terror, where as this one bashes that door down. One of the massive improvements from the original compared to this one is the acting. Melissa George and Ryan Reynolds as Kathy & George are so good, especially Reynolds. He brings a comedic aspect to the serious character that lightens things up a bit with his line delivery. Margot Kidder and James Brolin from the original film were good, but George and Reynolds add a likability to their characters which was much needed. The child actors held their own as well which was nice.I really enjoyed this modern re-telling of the Amityville story. It added more scares, better acting, and greater entertainment value to the original 1979 version which has not aged well. I highly recommend this to any horror fan.8/10",The Amityville Horror
122,vip-danii,"Good Idea, Bad Execution.",5,10 April 2013,"It was an O.K.-ish ghost story, but far from perfect. The movie is watchable, and sometimes even slightly creepy, but nothing new or extraordinary. You've seen ALL of this in other movies, trust me.A few major problems: (1) The lead actress (I use the term ""actress"" very loosely here) was unacceptably bad. Her acting was cringeworthy. For many years, I have considered Sandra Bullock to be the absolute worst -- she's the most talentless of them all. Annoyingly unconvincing... and that constant overacting in every movie... just horrendous. Well, this one was on par with her. She must've attended Paris Hilton's acting school.I think this was the same broad that ruined ""30 Days of Night"". How do people THIS bad manage to get work? Seriously.(The stepfather was not very good, either; but the child actors were actually pretty good).(2) I thought the ""scares"" were way overdone and mostly unconvincing. It was just over-the-top, which actually made the movie unwatchable at times. Babysitter stuck in the closet? Millions of flies attacking the priest out of nowhere and a voice whispering ""get out""? Fridge magnets rearranging themselves while you turn your back? Blood dripping from walls, faucets, etc (how lame)... stuff like that is just annoying. It's not scary and it's definitely not original. And, of course, they had to include delusions and hallucinations -- as expected.(3) They ripped off quite a few movies in the process. For example, the scene where the priest is running away from the house -- that scene is actually from ""Casper The Friendly Ghost""! And that basement scene with the fireplace -- that's from one of the Freddy Kruger movies (""A Nightmare On Elm Street""). At least 5 times (probably more) throughout the movie, I went: ""Hang on, I've seen that before -- in a different movie."" And these rip-off were done is such a blatantly obvious manner, too. (4) A lot of the things in the movie just don't make any sense. Most of all, they were trying to tell us that the guy turns into a psycho when he's near the house. As soon as he is a few miles away, he INSTANTLY snaps back to normal. Have you heard something this nonsensical in your life? Neither have I. And what kind of ""family"" is this? There is zero bond between them. No chemistry between the characters and that woman does not look like she could possibly be a mother of 3. Plus, the children act like they hate her, even though the antagonist is supposed to be the step father. Very, very unconvincing. So... yeah. Like I said, it's watchable, but not what I would call a GOOD movie. Didn't enjoy it much.",The Amityville Horror

125,kergillian,The best horror film of the year - so far...!,8,12 April 2005,"Forget, for a moment, that you ever saw the original. Forget the 'based on true events' tag-line - inevitably there to sell extra tickets. After all, a horror film based on true events is Hotel Rwanda, far scarier than this - though for different reasons.Now that those little tidbits are out of your system, sit back and prepare for the best damn horror film of the year! The suspense is there, with the right blend of sharp cutting, solid pacing, slick cinematography and a musical accompaniment by someone who has obviously done his horror film homework (Clay Duncan's work on the Ring films' scores surely helped...). The editors did work on films like Face/Off, True Romance and MI:II, which certainly helped a novice director (Andrew Douglas), whose only other film was a Southern-Christian documentary entitled 'Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus'.The film is not perfect - there are a few moments of tedium - namely when the characters - particularly Ryan Reynold's ever-darkening George - get repetitive, especially with the dialogue. And the end drags a little as the family desperately try to escape the horror - no, I won't spoil it, but think to yourself when watching the film: why not just break the bloody window? And why run further UP the roof, instead of just jumping off the edge of the lower eave?Still, great editing and a fantastic atmospheric setting move this film easily through any minor difficulties, and as a longtime horror fan, I did find myself startled on occasion - though that may have been due to the two *shrieking* girls directly behind me (and here I thought the film was 13 and over...? They may have looked older, but they could have fooled me...their behaviour certainly didn't)All in all, I give this one high marks for excitement, pacing, and eeriness. It mixes the right amount of horror with dramatic flavour and tension. Not the best horror film ever, but a helluva lot of fun! 7.5/10.",The Amityville Horror
126,Vampenguin,"Awful, watch the original",3,3 May 2006,"Have you ever seen a movie and hated it, then a few months later you decide it can't be as bad as you thought, so you decide to check it out again? Naturally it's as bad as ever, and now you're twice as mad because you've now you've wasted 3 hours of your life instead of only an hour and a half? For me, this is just that kind of movie. I saw it in theatres and thought it was garbage, but I recently bought it cheap, thinking/hoping that it would be better than I remembered it. Of course, it wasn't.First off, it had a lot to live up to; the original Amityville is one of the greatest horror films of all time. Most remakes are at the very least a bit disappointing, but this really takes the cake. First off, we have Ryan Reynolds in the James Brolin role. Reyolds should stick to stupid teen comedies, because this film proves that he's unintentionally hilarious even when he's trying not to be. The face he makes during a scene near the end had me in hysterics. Also, he's about as far from sympathetic as you can get. You really felt sorry for what Brolin had to go through, but you couldn't care less about this guy. Melissa George wasn't great either, her lines had no feeling to them. It's sad to think that what was likely the best actor involved also starred in the abysmal ""Fear of the Dark"".Speaking of that kid, how out of place was the whole deal with the babysitter? That whole scene was nothing more than pointless eye candy, and she wasn't even all that good looking.It shares this next flaw with a lot of modern horror movies: it takes the audience for idiots. The original hardly explained anything, it left the audience to think. It also never showed us the ghosts. Of course, this has to be the polar opposite. A really out of place scene was added near the end to explain every little occurrence, and we were treated to crappy looking CGI ghosts every couple minutes.I wont even start on how moronic the ending is, just so I don't spoil it for the poor souls who still want to see this drivel.One last complaint: the priest. He was one of the best parts of the original, but in this he only appears for a brief scene near the end, which is a shame as he seemed like a decent actor.The one thing this film had going for it was atmosphere. As pointless as they are, the scenes in the basement near the end visually look pretty awesome. Despite this small visual treat, I say avoid it at all costs. You wont be missing much, rent the original instead. On another note, I doubt that anyone who actually enjoyed this would like the original, but thats a rant for another day.3/10",The Amityville Horror
127,jaxbubba,"Borrow from a Buddy, because it's not worth it yourself....",3,9 June 2005,"A remake to the 1979 horror film The Amityville Horror, and based on  the true events of a 28-day stay in a haunted house and the best seller  of the same name; in this day and age, a house just isn't scary enough.  So the writer's of this remake add a torture chamber in the basement,  and quick-cuts of gruesome tortured souls to add spice and horror to  this very overdone classic tale of suburbia gone awry. To date, nine  (9) Amityville tales of horror have been told on film since 1979, each  worst than the one prior, and I have to admit; that this remake does  not break with tradition.  In this go around, Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George star as George and  Kathy Lutz; a middle class couple who find the house of their dreams  amid the country side in the quiet town of Amityville, New York, a  peaceful enclave on Long Island's south shore. Unbeknownst to our happy  couple, that almost one year prior to the date of purchase, Ronald  DeFeo, Jr. had committed mass murder of his parents and family in the  very same house. Citing demon possession, DeFeo claimed the house was  haunted. After twenty-eight days of residing in the house, George and  Kathy Lutz fled their Amityville dream home for the very same reason.  The funny thing about this film is that 26 years after the fact; it  turns out that the whole kit-and-caboodle was a scam orchestrated by  George Lutz to merely get out from under a mortgage that he couldn't  afford. So why not tell that story? A story so grand that it took a  national by surprised, and spawn 9 theatrical sequels. Oh well, who am  I to suggest something so devious, and unquestionably dishonest? Just a  thought..  This film is hardly worth noting, it fails on both fronts; it's not  scary, nor is it a documentary to the events which occurred. Its  Hollywood fluff for the fast buck, so we're probably in store for a  tenth serial in the near future depending on box office receipts and  DVD rentals.",The Amityville Horror
128,diand_,Laid-back horror,3,24 July 2005,"The Amityville Horror is once again a horror movie with surprisingly little gore and tries to build its based-on-true-events story with attention to psychological forces, tension building and a house. Some people compare it to The Shining. There is even the obligatory overhead shot referring to this movie. But they are worlds apart. This is so lazy and unimaginative in its execution that it is hardly lifted above the average. The house offered many possibilities to explore as a character (with its ghosts) but all the shots in and around the house are without any imagination. As Chelsea enters the roof there are few shots suggesting depth. As the ghosts are shown, they have almost no dramatic impact on the viewer. The transformation of George the father is not very insightful portrayed for the viewer: He turns from father to maniac in an instant and that's not very plausible. A plot twist could have helped the movie regain some interest half-way (e.g. George non-existent but only imagined, George a reincarnation of the original killer). But we are served a simple explanation (why has there to be one at all and why that simple?).Horror movies go through a difficult period. There is an audience out there, but we need more creativity from the people who make them. The true horror here lies in the making of another dismal product supported by Michael Bay and friends.",The Amityville Horror

Of course less is more as the original showed us without the fancy trickery of the remake.There are some silly scenes that leave little to the imagination and are just not scary.

After seeing the previous Amityville Horrors I wasn't sure how this one would rate as the first one appeared to be true strictly based on the true story and therefore un-scary, and the others were stupidly unbelievable. This film tops them in shocking horror whilst trying to stick to a semi-realistic storyline. It also goes more into the reason why the house is as haunted as it seems. Without giving too much away this film has several very frightening bits which surpass many horrors of modern times. The lingering image of the little girl and the daemonic faces which haunt the family are a great touch. The ending is good but seems to leave you wondering what happens afterwards.

Other than an opportunity to cast a youthful, shirtless, Ryan Reynolds, there is no storyline or substance to the film. What we have seen before was done better in the original film and even THAT wasn't very good! What is new, is even MORE far-fetched than the original story, making this remake almost totally useless.The special effects are lame and serve little more than to shock combined with music effects that seem out of place. Nothing is really scary. This film serves more as a teen-flick so the MTV generation can ohhhh and ahhha Ryan Reynolds. Nothing else.POSSIBLE SPOILER: Be forewarned of a very graphic scene involving the demise of the family dog about 55 minutes into the film when George enters the boathouse.

I went to see the movie to have a tense thriller shoved down my neck but this just stuck to instant shocks and loud music to scare you.I am not convinced about the characters and to be honest I am already struggling to remember who they were.All in all it was an OK film and if you are seeing it for the first time then you will enjoy it.

However, I doubt this needed to be pegged as a remake since it is identical to every other modern movie about haunted houses out there. You could tell me this was another remake of The Grudge, but set in a place called Amityville, and it wouldn't really make that much difference. That's because there is no real plot in this movie. There is the recycled concept, an extremely brief back story, but no real plot other than a bunch of spooky things happening.This movie has a creepy little ghost girl. If you have never seen a horror movie in your life you might find this scary.The ending is terrible. We get a ridiculous ""vision"" that only occurs to fake out the audience into believing something has happened even though it only turns out to be a possible outcome. If you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about.Ryan Reynolds is not that good of an actor, but he does a decent job here. He goes over-the-top at some points, as if he was possessed by Jack Nicholson in The Shining, but believe me, he's no Jack Nicholson.The Amityville Horror is not really scary and definitely not original (even if it is a remake).

You can even find the ""Day 1"", etc. labels before the scenes.When the boy goes out from his room at late night to the toilet I found an almost identical scene to the one in The Sixth Sense... Well, I think you get the point.Only the suddenly appearing ghosts and the father ax scene with his stepson scared me. The rest is very soft and doesn't maintain stress the way it should (mainly because you get to think you are watching The Shining instead of The Amityville Horror, without Kubrick, of course).And it's very predictable, too, as they tell you what will happen again and again.

If you saw the original in 1979 staring James Brolin that's really all you would need to believe that this whole story about haunting's at the famous house in Amityville was a con job. It is true that an entire family (Defeo Family) was murdered as they slept by the crazed son who lived in the basement who would later say demons told him to do it. Oh yawn might as well say the dog told me to do it.This is pretty much as the 1979 version except the special effects are a lot better and it is not as scary. The house does not even look like the real place. I doubt very much that dead little girls were hiding in closets and demons roaming around hidden rooms under the house.

136,ghoulieguru,The Amityville Borer,2,23 November 2005,"By ""borer"" I mean that it will bore you to death before it horrifies you. It's a shame too, I actually liked the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre that was done by Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes company. I was hoping that this would be similar, but the only similarity is that they are both remakes of horror movies from the 70's.To be fair, it's not like the original Amityville Horror was anything great. It, like the remake, borrowed heavily from other successful ghost stories of the time to try and capitalize on some of their success. No one will ever be able to convince me that George Lutz carrying around an axe in the original was not a direct rip- off of Stephen King's crochet mallet wielding villain in The Shining. I know, the film version of The Shining came out a year after the original Amityville Horror, but Stephen King wrote the novel of the Shining several years before the Amityville Horror book was written (or should I say plagiarized?)In the same fashion, this remake borrows heavily from the ghost stories that seem to be successful right now. Namely, the J-horror aesthetic of the little girl ghost. It worked in the Ring, and it worked in the Grudge, so it will work in Amityville Horror, right? Well, to be blunt... no. It didn't work. In fact, it felt like the blatant rip-off that it was.But like I said, the original film borrowed from other ghost stories of the period, so does the remake. That's not the worst part of this movie, and that's not why I hate this movie so much.Where this movie goes wrong is that absolutely nothing happens until the last ten minutes of the film. The original had the same problem, but you'd hope that we would learn something in 25 years. No such luck. The main scares in the first hour of the movie are: Magnets rearrange themselves on the fridge, little girl goes into the boat house alone, little girl climbs up onto the roof, George Lutz complains of it being cold, George chops wood. I'm not kidding. There's no body count to this movie. Other than the DeFeo family, that gets killed in the first five minutes, there is not a single casualty.Which brings me to another thing that I hate about this movie. Does everyone know the true story of the Amityville Horror? It's not all that frightening unless you consider how depraved and ugly George and Kathy Lutz really were.George and Kathy bought a house they couldn't afford, a place where a mentally deranged kid named Ronnie DeFeo had shot his whole family. George and Kathy knew about the murders, they had a friend come over with pictures of the crime scene and they fabricated a whole haunted house story to help them GET OUT of their mortgage. Then they sold this ridiculous fiction as a book and a movie. They have made millions off of the DeFeo family tragedy. I find that a little disgusting. That's the TRUE STORY.But regardless of the truth, what's done is done. I hope that any surviving members of the DeFeo family sue everyone involved for defamation of character or something.Doing something stupid like giving millions of dollars to a con artist would be one thing, but then to make a really boring movie that's not even remotely entertaining is just a plain disgrace. It's a shame because I think Ryan Reynolds is hot as hell, and he's ripped to shreds in this movie, but it's not even good enough to skim through for the boy eye candy.",The Amityville Horror
137,jrs-8,And I thought remakes of bad movies was a good idea,2,18 April 2005,"I have always been a strong believer that Hollywood should stop remaking the good movies and remake the bad ones. Take a long, close look at what went wrong and attempt to make it right. After seeing the dismal remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" I think perhaps I need to rethink my stance.I am not a big fan of the original film. I always found it more silly then scary and never could figure out why a family would wait 28 days of going through everything they went through before fleeing. This version doesn't do anything to clear that up. For that matter this version does very little.The new version seems less like the original and somewhat more like a ripoff of ""The Shining."" We just watch and watch as the father (here it's Ryan Reynolds as George Lutz playing way over his head) goes crazier in each scene. There is no character development whatsoever. The family moves in and he starts changing. It all happens so fast we have no time to care about him or the other members of the family. At a brief 87 minute running time it appears the director cared more about shocks then his characters.Speaking of the directing, it's been a long time since I have seen such sloppy direction in a major movie. The director wants to make his audience jump every few minutes but cheats in how he achieves (or attempts to) this. Whenever he wants a scare he simply has a chord of music blare on the soundtrack unexpectedly. Or a loud noise jolts through the theater speakers. I have an idea. Why not create a situation and achieve the scares through that. I detest when an audience is manipulated by a filmmaker. And I have never felt more manipulated in a movie then this one.Now let's speak of the script. There are several changes from this version to the original. I have no problem with that as long as they make sense to the story or add to the fear level. How about a scene where the priest comes to bless the house and the wife has to chase him to his car? That's right. The priest is literally running for his life to get to his car. Do you think maybe the wife might get the idea something is very wrong and get her kids the heck out of there no matter what her husband says? Phillip Baker Hall as the priest looks like he just wants his paycheck so he can move on to a better project.As it stands this new ""Amityville Horror"" may be the worst in the bunch of ""Amityville"" movies from the 80's. It's hard to imagine anything worse then ""Amityville 2:The Possession"" but this just might be it. And the third film at least had some good 3-D effects. What worries me most is that this film will spawn remakes of the bad originals and, God forbid, make them even worse.As I said at the top maybe I need to rethink my position that only bad movies should be remade to try and improve upon them. After seeing ""The Amityville Horror"" perhaps remakes should be abolished altogether.",The Amityville Horror
138,Phantasm01,The only remake that I believe surpasses it's original counterpart,8,14 May 2006,"Okay, before I begin, I would simply like to know what it was about this film that was allegedly so bad. I missed this one in theaters and have since read every manner of unfair dissertation you can possibly imagine. Do people these days go to movies solely for the purpose of picking them apart? Apparently, aside from myself and most of my immediate friends and family, they do. What gives? A great many who post here and on the many different message boards I frequent seem so vehemently against the existence of remakes. That leads me to wonder why they bother dedicating their time to watching them in the first place. These people have already convinced themselves of the presumptous notion that the movie will automatically bomb, so why do they put themselves through such unnecessary torture? I guess that is a mystery destined to remain unsolved.I own the first two original ""Amityville"" films and, personally, I have to say I was very impressed with what I saw in this remake. Andrew Douglas comes across very competent in his directing skills, and Scott Kosar's screenplay got everything right. This was an updating that upped the intensity level several welcome notches, and the pacing was through the roof. I applaud these improvements because the original movie, while still a fairly decent film in its own right, has not aged very well. It was long overdue for a remake and, for my money, it was well worth the blind buy I made. Nobody will ever really know what happened in that house. Did Ronald De Feo hear voices that compelled him to slaughter his entire family? Were evil spirits or ghosts the real reason behind the Lutz family's departure? Who can say? This remake scored points with me because it gave me everything I wanted out of the original. I went into this looking for a fun, fast-paced thrill ride--which is exactly what all the promotional information promised it would be--and that is precisely what I got. I don't regret the time I invested while sitting through it and I still, for the life of me, do not understand why so many others continue to slam it into oblivion.I would recommend this to anybody who feels the same way about the originals as I do. It is not a classic, nor does it try to be. This is a horror movie, plain and simple, one that was done in very much the manner I would like other films to follow. Nice work, Mr. Douglas. Very nice, indeed.",The Amityville Horror
139,WCS02,"Lisa the BabySitter's the highlight. Good, horror fun. See it!",6,16 April 2005,"I liked it. Here's what to watch for: 1) Best actor: ""Lisa the BabySitter"". Even if the film this isn't your cup of tea, stick around to catch a glimpse of babysitting-2005 courtesy of Ms. Lisa! She's great. Ryan Reynolds (a Jason Lee lookalike) in truth gets the best actor award for his macabre transformation. He's good!2) Most unusual moment: When the family tries to elude danger one dark and stormy night like the Von Trapps on a hot, wet roof. The scene conjured up images of the Sound of Music for me, swapping out the nasty Nazis with a Lizzie Borden-like ax man.3) Economy: One priest gets the job of four (from the original) done. When the priest is played by master character actor ""Philip Michael Hall"" what would you expect.4) Scary: ... has it's moments. Nothing unique and original . . . but Director Andrew Douglas gets the job done for newcomers to the horror genre. Enjoy.All in all, it's a 6 out of 10. Better than the original.

140,filmbuff-36,Take it from me -- root for the ghosts,5,21 April 2005,"In terms of cinematic legacy, the original ""The Amityville Horror"" managed to foreshadow both ""The Shining"" and ""Poltergeist"" while swiping a few nods from ""The Exorcist."" But time has not been kind to the hit 1979 horror film, once considered spooky but now considered at best a camp classic.The remake opens in the late 1970s, with George Lutz (Ryan Reynolds) and his new wife Kathy (Melissa George) getting what appears to be the deal of a lifetime. A colonial era Long Island home that is within their price range has just come up for sale, and the two decide the place would be perfect to raise their children, all from Kathy's previous marriage.Little do they know that the house comes with loads of supernatural baggage. The previous owner had killed his entire family within 28 days of moving in, claiming there was a demonic presence in the home that drove him to do so. It's not long before strange things start to happen with the new family as well.Chelsea (Chloë Grace Moretz) starts seeing the ghost of the previous little girl who occupied the house, Billy (Jesse James) and Michael (Jimmy Bennett) see supernatural activity while also being blamed for the trouble it causes, and George begins to go mad, taking increasingly drastic steps to maintain order and discipline the children. It's not long before Kathy begins to suspect that all is not right in their quaint little home.""The Amityville Horror"" is such a mediocre film, you can't help but wonder what was once considered so shocking about the original story. In truth, with all the negative reviews the original movie received, it's obvious that that film (and its numerous sequels) is merely famous for being famous. The thing that most people seem to remember is the front of the house itself, which actually is scary looking. It's just a shame there's never been a horror movie filmed in the house to do its spooky appearance justice.The other thing to note is that the remake still claims to be based on a true story, which is partially true. The real life Lutz's account was eventually proved to be a hoax to cover up the fact that the family couldn't pay their mortgage, but not before the family made millions on everything from talk show appearances to the movie rights.The movie never really lets you into the horror that is occurring, and director Andrew Douglas does a very workman-like job directing the story, never really doing anything to interest us in the characters or situation. Special effects run amok, like walls that ooze blood and jack-in-the-box scares like decomposing ghosts jumping out at you, but it's all for naught. The movie can only scream ""boo!"" at you so many times before you start booing back.Acting-wise, the movie is decent but not terribly inspired. Just like Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining,"" Reynolds seems to lose his sanity just a tad too early for the rest of the story to be believable. As Kathy, George manages to be the emotional anchor holding the film together and does a good job, however her character puts up with far too much stress before she finally acts. The child actors all do okay, but they merely exist to be put in danger.So, what was the purpose of remaking a horror movie that hasn't aged very well over the last quarter of a century? The main reason I can think of is the house itself, which still manages to scare people. Other than that, there's a big market for remaking classic horror films right now, though hardly any of been able to justify their own existence, including last year's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" also produced and written by the same team behind this film. ""The Amityville Horror"" is likely to join that undistinguished canon, ultimately being a horror movie about a group of people too dumb to leave a house just because the script requires them to stay. It's movies like this that make you want to root for the ghosts.5 out of 10 stars. It's hard to feel sympathetic for characters in a movie who have to stay in a stupid situation just because the script says so.",The Amityville Horror
141,Mister-Creeper,Better Than The Original,8,19 August 2007,"I usually hang my head in disgust when I hear about yet another horror movie remake, but I still watch them anyways just to see how much justice they can serve the original film. But, with all the horror movie remakes being done these days, this is one of the few that I can actually say is better than the original(not by a lot, but better nonetheless).You basically have the same plot outline as the original. Lutz family moves into the house where the murders of 6 family members took place years before. Once the story is set and the movie gets going, it never looks back. It's one ghostly haunting after another and keeps you on the edge of your seat, not wanting to miss a single second.Like I said, this is one of the best horror movie remakes I've seen in a while. Although I wish Hollywood would produce more ""original"" horror movies, I still give the remakes a chance(which is more than a lot of people are willing to do). Most people are ready to trash them before the movie is even complete. On the rare occasion we do get a very good remake, such as this one, I'll be one of first to accept it and say, ""That was pretty good for a remake."" ...such as I am saying now with The Amityville Horror.

Other than that, they had a film that was shot, well somewhat well however, it's supposed to be 'Scary'. And there was not a thing scary about this film for me.It was a cheap remake of something else, that cost very little to produce, (see budget) and it shows. The thing about it that ticks me off is, I'm a scary movie kinda guy yet I'm soooo sick and tired of these cookie cutter, lets throw it out there and see what sticks films. They made they're money back on the first weekend and now making a profit and thats probably all they care about.I wanted to be entertained, maybe even, (as it should be), frightened or scared a bit. However, not a jump nor nearly a flinch for me. I feel like I was taken and that ticks me off.So, if you want previously chewed movie making, then have at it.

144,richard-wheeler,Avoid this!,1,1 April 2006,"The make over of the 1979 Horror Classic : ""The Amityville Horror"" was a disaster! All my friends at school told me it was ""brilliant"" when it was not. I am saying this because, I have been doing research on the Amityville Horror since I was 12 years old.The movie begin with so much suspense, and it was shocking to see what Ronald Butch De Feo, Jr did to his family on the 13th of November 1974. But what disappointed me was that the film did not show the total truth of the Amityville Murders. It seems, however, that Ronnie had a tiny baby sister named Jodie! No!! He had an 18 year old sister named Dawn who stayed on the third floor and a 13 year old sister on the second floor. And none of the family members woke up when the killings began at 3:15 a.m.! But the film still does reveal most of the truth in the beginning of the film. For example, all the bodies were found face down in their beds , and Ronnie did hear voices coming from inside the house telling him to murder his family.The house did have a sign outside saying : ""High Hopes"". And, of course, a very similar appearance of how Mr and Mrs. Lutz looked and George's change in behavior while living in the house and very good mentioning John Ketchum who practiced witch craft on the property before the house was built.As for the rest of the film, it was just rubbish! The house was not built in 1692, it was built in 1925! And when the baby sitter came, she actually only came to babysit Chelsea Lutz, which was meant to be Missy Lutz! In this version, the baby sitter came to babysit the kids, she was a pot addict and she was crazy to mention to the kids about what happened to the De Feos. The baby sitter was actually meant to be a normal school girl who was locked in Missy's closet and was eventually let out by Mr and Mrs.Lutz with bleeding hands and was not meant to be cast off to hospital like in this film! And finally, Jodie. Jodie was not a member of the De Feo family, she was Missy's imaginary friend which was a demonic pig! And she was causing all the paranormal disturbances.Do you want to find out what really happened? Watch the original Amityville Horror. And if that doesn't appeal to you, watch the following documentaries: Amityville Horror: The Hauntings and The Amityville Horror: Horror or Hoax.Avoid this crap!",The Amityville Horror
145,Bungle-9,I want a refund.,4,20 April 2005,"I haven't seen the original, and after this I'm not sure I want to. I thought all of this was a little bit silly and devoid of character. Some bits were a little beyond belief - for example the mother can't have been any more than 28 or something, but she was very fit etc. and yet she was supposed to have 3 kids without a single stretch mark on her. Curious....Essentially, I felt that this was the American version of the American version of The Grudge, only not as good. I'm sick and tired of having ""the beautiful people"" shoved down our throats in mainstream cinema - this was a prime example, in that the protagonists are the blonde beauty with the nice bust and lack of any sort of fat on her body, alongside the ridiculously buff dark-haired muscle-bound symbol of masculinity.

In this case, they're both about as mediocre and moronic, but this one is even worse. The one or two scenes in the original that scared me where completely ruined by predictable jump scares, which the film relies on a lot, as well as bad special effects. The remake significantly toned-down the priest character, and that's both a good thing and a bad thing.

Spoiler Info Inside**Having been steered away form this movie from the beginning , the movie found itself head to head with color bars and a third hour repeat of Sports center , and won.This was actually the only Amityville I had not seen. At the time it was buried under the ""lame remake"" opinion. Having reviewed it now I agree with remake , but find it not so lame.What was right in this movie. The writing. Scott Kosar's Re-Adaptation is very loyal to it's 1979 predecessor. Only a few well thought out twists are added and with the intent obviously of forming up the looser ends of the previous script.The acting. With a direct nod to Ryan Reynolds who I am certain spent considerable time and anguish reviewing James Brolin's 1979 take of George Lutz. Phillip Baker Hall is deserving of a nod for carefully reprising the nature of The priest Father Callaway , from the former Character Father Delaney by Rod Steiger. This being the film debut of Chloe Grace Moretz is another series parallel , as Amityville 3-d was the debut of Meg Ryan.What was wrong. The story is cold in reception , it is unable to generate either strong empathy for any character , and at the same time unable to completely engross you in fear. Ryan Reynolds fantastic mental break down even fueled by better visual material and story arc just can't make it over the top. As the operative character rabbiting the plot this makes for weak flow.When deciding on a movie truly being bad , less than three stars, as I firmly believe in the five star system. Movies like this one are easily reduced to a simple question. Did you waste your time? I was entertained by this film , and do not feel so.Three Stars(of 5)",The Amityville Horror

The 70's version was bad enough but this remake proves you can sink lower than rock bottom. The producers of this turkey could make some money by cutting most of the movie out and just selling the shirtless (or nearly nude) shots of Ryan Renolds in all his buffed out glory as soft-core gay porn.

The plethora of horror effects that fill almost every minute of screen time from then on seem to counter any suggestion it might be for real. Its more like a trip in the Ghost Train at Disneyland. Indeed the original film made on the book was more believable. No family in their right minds would stay in this latest film house of horrors for ten minutes let alone 28 days. Further more after wearing the special effects thin, the writers seem to have taken Stephen King's ""Shining"" to heart, and the story ploughs on from that angle. With red eyed Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz) looking like he's parodying Jack Nicholson in that Kubrick film (which was a classic of its type). It gets even sillier when we see coffins lined up with the family names on them. So this latest intrusion into the house at Amityville is the least effective so far, with very little suspense except maybe in the rescue sequence on the high roof. The set designers have come up with the same look for the house as the original film. But there is little other attempt to recreate the period, even the costumes are very much 2005, which again suspends belief that this is the retelling of a true event that happened in the 70's.",The Amityville Horror

I HAVE read the book and seen the original movie and have seen footage of the real George and Kathy Lutz discussing their supposed experiences in the home in Amityville and this movie was nothing like it with a few exceptions. If I were George Lutz I think I would be ready to sue the makers of this movie. I don't recall anywhere seeing, reading or hearing that George Lutz attempted to murder the family as is portrayed in this movie. Also the Dafoe murders were not accurately portrayed. There was no Jodie Dafoe. The 2 daughters were Dawn and Allison. Dawn was 17 and Allison 12. Allison was the younger and was killed lying facedown in her bed, not shot in a closet. She was also on the 2nd floor, not in the upstairs bedroom, Dawn the older sister was killed there while lying face down in bed. I read that the home may have been built over an Indian burial ground but the scenes in the basement with the preacher and the indians was absurd to say the least. This movie did not scare me at all, at times I was just left shaking my head most of the time.

There was not one moment where I would say to myself, ""Wow, that was cool"" or to a lesser extent ""AAH!"". Occasionally, I caught myself sleeping, and was looking at a friend of mine to see if she was still awake. Even the ending that you could tell was coming was just, so utterly predictable and boring. Anti-climactic would be another good word. A mass of groans and eyes rolling would be what you'd see if the lights went up at that ending.

Like, Poltergeist has a PG stuck on it.Also, with newer films there has been a drift to pg-13. They have become more and more light in gore over the years. With this being a newer horror film, a haunted house movie, and a remake(which also have been seeming rather light and bland lately) I thought I was going into your typical trying to make you jump movie.Boy was I wrong.I should have expected it though. With horror films becoming lighter there is bound to be some whiplash and an ultra gory movie is bound to be pumped out every now and then. This is one such movie.Don't let it's start full you.

The whole film tries to pull a shining, and it doesn't do a half bad job. The characters are pretty well developed so you can see the family fall apart over time really well. All the acting is pretty good, the plot isn't half bad, and it will keep the gore hounds happy.The only real flaws is the laking ending and the horror clichés that are placed threw out the film, to rather painful extremes.But, if you want to see a movie that isn't half bad, and that can really grouse you out, well then go check this out.PS.

A lot of horror films are either really loved or really hated but I think this one is right around in the pretty good mark. The story was changed a little from the original legend, but It stayed together still pretty well. I think some things were a little too much (talk about it later) but as far as the main story goes I think it was good. Filmmaking wise, I think they did well. Good directing for a modern horror remake, and the cinematography gave it a really cool and creepy feeling. Most of the acting was good too, and a surprisingly great performance by Ryan Reynolds, which I wouldn't expect out of him knowing his earlier work. The film is almost more creepy or eerie than scary but it gets the job done. More of an old school style of horror film. More similar to The Shinning than many other horror films made in recent times. The bad guy is a house, not a random killer, it makes the film scarier and more ominous than a lot of others. ****Spoilers****My main problem with the film was the stuff about the Indian burial ground in the basement. I understand they were trying to make everything make more sense and wrap it up better but I think it was too much. It actually made it less believable and more ridiculous. I think leaving out a better explanation makes it scarier and would have left you guessing and talking more.

I've probably wasted six months off my life with all the haunted horror house films I've seen but this is one of the best. First off, the acting is excellent and Ryan Reynolds really shines playing the head of the household, George Lutz. Not many actors can be likable and funny in one scene and twenty minutes later look crazed without being stupid. Reynolds really pulled it off for me. The suspense builds slowly and there aren't too many cheap tricks where the director tries to get the audience to 'jump.' Instead we have a lot of psychological horror that is so haunting that I can recall specific scenes vividly - something that doesn't happen very often. Plus, the movie isn't overrun by slow suspense either - with a running time of about ninety minutes you're getting entertained, not bored! I had very low hopes for this film and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the directing, cinematography, and even the gore make-up.

The rest of them (especially the children) was pretty stock. There were a few creepy scenes when the family first moves in. I especially enjoyed the scene when the young son has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.The Bad:Acting by the majority of the cast seemed pretty stale. I wasn't sold on any of the emotions outside of reynolds. Effects were fair by todays standards and even some of the ""ghosts"" seemed out of the 13 ghosts mold.

He gets blocked in the basement and bursts out, could have been a great, ""Here's Georgie"" scene. They should have done it at least it would have been funny.

A re-make of a film that critics hated in 1979, and was the #2 box-office hit of 1979 and still a classic. Even if you don't believe the story of George and Kathy Lutz, this is still a scary flick.And the fact remains, Ronald DeFaio did murder his 6 family members while they slept, because voices in the house told him to ""catch em, Kill 'em,"" in this freaky house in 1974..Did the house become haunted after this tragedy? Was it already haunted? I dunno..But this is a great horror flick. And Ryan Reynolds' sexy face and sexy muscles doesn't hurt matters!

The movie that all critics have been blasting gets to the number one place on the Box Office charts...it't too bad that America has fallen to such low as to support terrible money making monopoly. I have not seen this film, but I do not have to. The fact that this film even made it to the top ten is enough to make you wonder how people these days are helping the world. ...And they wonder why SAT and ACT scores are failing...this movie is the answer. The original film made in the late seventies which starred Margot Kidder was not the best piece of cinema work, but it had art to it and the people who made it put their best in a script that was somewhat lackluster. With this mish mash of a remake, there is nothing to celebrate. All the actors are pretty faces who can't act and a crew who would more likely work on the next music video for KoRn or Maralyn Manson. This was a really bad music video full of corny dialogue, and even worse plotting. Adding to an already complete story maybe good for money, but as for the audiences...

I am not dumb or stupid. This kind of crap is all fake. There are no demons, no ghosts, no poltergeists or any of that shit. I'm sick and tired of this crap being advertised as real. It was even proven that George Lutz and a friend of his made the whole thing up and that none of it was real.

This time is no exception.For months, I've been hearing and reading about how this remake wasn't a ""remake"" at all, but was going to follow the story of the book, rather than the first movie. Boy, was that a lie. Not only did many of the things in this version come from the first (including dialogue which was hardly changed), there were new story lines, new fiction that we'd never read or seen before. If this was supposed to accurately follow the book, I must have read a different book.There was nothing frightening about this film at all. The creepiness of the original ghost story is no longer there. This time, we have more of a monster/zombie-type flick that isn't the slightest bit jump-worthy.If you were a fan of the original or the book, don't see this. It'll upset you and make you wish for your time and money back. If you've never seen the original or haven't read the book, do yourself a favor and do one of those two things and forget about seeing this waste of time.Definitely one of the worst movies I have seen in a LONG time.

167,nowonmai42,Horror-ble.,2,28 May 2005,"The real estate boom of recent years has no doubt been aided, at least in part, by a general lack of bleeding light switches and bullet-riddled child-wraiths hiding in the closets of most properties on the market. Irrational exuberance, though, inevitably leads to the occasional discovery that one's just-purchased dream home is actually a unique fixer-upper opportunity, the kind that talks and helpfully rearranges refrigerator magnets into shibboleths like ""katch 'em and kill 'em."" If ever you find yourself among these unfortunate few, it will be crucial to follow the example of the Lutz family of ""The Amityville Horror"" and STAY IN THE HOUSE.""The Amityville Horror"" is the latest in the recent wave of horror remakes that have shrewdly allowed filmmakers to sidestep the gauntlet thrown down by the self-aware ""Scream"" series and its clones. With their characters themselves well-versed in horror conventions, such films would seem to have challenged the genre to raise its game, or at the very least to create a new body of cliché. The result instead has been to empty Hollywood's (and Japan's) vaults, hire the young hotties of the moment, up the gore, and edit the holy hell out of it all with enough jump cuts to induce epilepsy. ""The Amityville Horror"" is convinced that a moment cannot truly be startling without a backing of thunderous percussion, nor an atmosphere genuinely creepy without the occasional glimpse of a rotting corpse. It seems almost a tacit acknowledgment by director Andrew Douglas that the original really wasn't such a memorable scarefest after all.There's a serious laziness at the heart of ""The Amityville Horror"" and its ilk. A shopworn conceit can be made fresh without resorting to rehashing leftovers (see M. Night Shyamalan's ""Signs""), and it certainly doesn't need to be turned into a music video. When the Lutzes could be running out of the front door, they instead decide to climb onto the roof in a driving rain, one of many silly, unnecessary moments in a silly, unnecessary movie. But to laugh at yet another character deciding to investigate a dark, scary basement alone is to play right into the hands of ""The Amityville Horror."" We're back on familiar territory, and are meant to be appreciative. This movie is like a flat soda. You may drink it if you're thirsty enough, but it will never be refreshing.",The Amityville Horror

Thats one of the main problems i noted through-out, it doesn't seem like a big deal for someone just expecting a few chills but for the fans it goes over the top and in some cases the events are completely fictional.The actors are great but their not suited for their roles, and in films based on true story's i think that its really important for them to have some similarity. It doesn't seem like its set in the 70's at all, and another problem is the house itself. I read that they had to make the recreation slightly different from the real house, although when they say slightly they mean the entire concept.Although all these things might be done to impress us by making it scarier, its less scarier knowing all of these faults, especially when the original was so much better.",The Amityville Horror
169,IMSandman,Completely Different than the Original... Though the Original was Better!,6,18 April 2005,"For those of you that have not yet seen either movie, think hard about which one you want to see first. It had been well over 10 years since I had seen the original and I remembered very, very little of it.Thus, we went to see the 2005 version first. The movie is a great horror flick in the sense that it isn't your typical everyday horror movie. It is the script that makes the movie great. Van Wilder, I mean Ryan Reynolds, was great in the movie and is becoming a blooming actor.Immediately after watching the new version, we came home and watched the original version on DVD.This is the biggest difference: The original assumes the viewer is intelligent while the new version needs to go to great lengths to spell everything out for the viewer.Some examples (warning mini-spoilers involved): 1) The clock: In the original, you see that he keeps waking up at a certain time, while in the new version, they show you the alarm clock stuck at that time from the start.2) The murders: In the original, you don't actually see the murders in a graphic fashion, while the new one shows everything. Psycho is one of the best thrillers of all time, yet Hitchcock shows no violence... his genius is that he leaves it all up to the viewers' imaginations.3) The babysitter: In the original, she is a geek with braces complete with matching headgear. In the new version, she is a hooch who wants to hook up with a boy much younger than her. (Though I must admit she was a cool addition.) :) 4) Characters: In the original, there are a bunch of characters that make up the core of the movie. In the new version, the number of important characters are reduced to a minimum. Once again, this is a way to play ""down"" to the audience as if we can't handle processing a larger number of characters.5) Supernatural: The original is much more religious in nature. The original is much more like the Exorcist or the Omen. The new version is more focused on the shock value. The new version is more like a Freddie or a Jason movie in that regard when comparing the original and new versions.And those 5 items listed above are just the tip of the iceberg.After seeing the new version, we came home and watched the original. The verdict?: NO COMPARISON. While the new version is very good, it pales in comparison to the original. The original just has a much better storyline and will leave you more scared, despite doing so with less on screen violence. The original is more ""spooky"" while the new version is more ""shocking"" and far less spooky.In conclusion, if you saw the new version and liked it, make sure to go and rent the original... you'll be in a for a pleasant surprise! And since the story lines are completely different, it is like watching an entirely different movie.Enjoy!",The Amityville Horror
170,the-evil-cult,Scary Gory Film,8,28 June 2006,"A family find a cheap house that seems expensive. The discount is due to a murder in which a man kills his whole family because he heard voices telling him to do it. As the movie progresses the man becomes more psychotic, the kids and the wife are starting to worry about him, I hear there is an older version of this movie but I have not seen it so I cannot make any comparisons. This movie is the newer version and it is pretty scary in my opinion. I was watching it at night in my room with headphones while lifting weights. The film often left me more breathless than the weights did. The scares are mainly from sudden grotesque images popping up accompanied simultaneously by sudden organ noises. There were moments when characters are walking around and it's absolutely quiet and I have have a feeling something is going to come out and I just fell like I want to turn down the volume. In my opinion scares of these sorts are kind of cheap but they certainly are effective. We humans I think have evolved to be alert when something sudden happens and many modern horror movies seem to take advantage of this. But once the adrenaline starts pumping it's only a short-term thing. When you come home and out of nowhere someone screams out ""Surprise!"" because they've prepared a surprise birthday party for you then you are scared because of shock and this response is expected. But after you realize that everything is safe then it no longer troubles you. What I'm trying to get at is that I'd like to see a movie that not only gives you shocks that haunt you for the first five seconds after that shock. I'd like to see something that haunts you say one year or more. After you finish the movie you're safe in your home, everything's okay, and the scariness is over.All in all though the remake of the Amityville Horror is enjoyable. From what I hear it's a true story so that makes it kind of scary. Chloe Moretz as the cute little girl acts really well. This movie contains blood and violence so keep away if you are too sensitive.",The Amityville Horror
171,LoupGarouTFTs,"Horrible, nonsensical farce of a movie",1,27 October 2013,"This ""retelling"" of the Amityville Horror was a horror in and unto itself. It bears absolutely no resemblance to the original story, except for the names of a few of the characters (including the dog!) and that a family was killed before the events of the story. The producers could have set this travesty anywhere and maybe made a fair ghost story out of it, although the acting was pretty terrible, too. Instead they tried to draw viewers in with a familiar name and created something that would leave those same viewers disappointed.MINOR SPOILERS! In addition to the terrible acting and the deviation from the original story, the inability of the writers to provide motivation for any actions in the story is evident from beginning to end. What mother in today's world grabs a name of a babysitter from a grocery store bulletin board and doesn't check references? Why is the mother so blind to everything going on at all? How could she not see George splitting the wood with her son *holding* that same wood (and except for the throw-away line of it being cold in the house, why is George splitting wood at all)? Other than his office being in the basement, why is George turning into such a rotten person?

I didn't have much hopes, but still this managed to disappoint me.Everything is below mediocre in this movie. The pictures, the music, directing. The characters are really distant. The artificial coloring, which is made in the editing room, is really ugly and unnecessary. But that (the coloring) seems to be the standard practice in today's movies. The atmosphere and the quality of the film is exactly the same as in the teenage ""horror"" movies made in the recent years (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Urban Legends"", etc.). So if you like them, maybe you like this also.I don't know what's the story behind making of this film: WHY? I haven't seen the older Amityvilles, so I cannot compare this to them, but this feels like a really vain effort. I think the better choice for directing this movie/story would have been Scott Derrickson, who made ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and the absolutely brilliant ""Hellraiser 5-Inferno"".

IE. when the ghost of Jodi pulls the baby-sitter finger and puts it into the bullet hole in her head. George Lutz was played as a I don't give a crap person even before the house started to effect him, you were almost hoping he would just die so the movie would be more bearable. I will admit the only thing good about the movie was the acting of the kids, they gave this life and at least watchable. Other then that I can find nothing good about this movie. The acting was forced and almost boring even when you were supposed to be scared you weren't.

I finally watched and guess what - it isn't. Sorry Ryan Reynolds, your Canadian charm can't save this dumpster fire. If the director and producers had t put so much into this movie it may actually have been better. The reason that horror movies of this sort are better in the 60s, 70s and early 80s is because the production value is less.

I haven't seen one this nauseating since Planet of the Apes. What they tried to pass off a re-imagined film is just another boring, soul-less, clichéd, piece of tripe using the same tired FX, shock treatment, and ""hip, edgy, sexiness"" that's been overdone to death. This film had very little connection to the original which, while it had it's problems, was much better than this crap. My top 10: 1.) In the book and in the original Jody was a PIG. Why in god's name is there now a JodyDefeo?? The DeFeos were a real family murdered in that house. Adding in a fictitious daughter seems to be stepping over a boundary somewhere.2.) Except for the vehicles and the clothing, at no time did I believe this was taking place in 1975.3.) Can we please lose the creepy dead girl with the long black hair and pale complexion? It's been done already. Way too many times.4.) Not every horror film needs a gratuitous sex scene if it adds nothing to the story. It's just cheapens it.5.) The original film told the story from the perspective of George Lutz. This one tells it from the little girls perspective. It doesn't work because the story is not supposed to be about HER.6.) The film lacks any depth whatsoever. Everyone was way too busy trying to look sexy. The story, as bad as it was, was lost.7.) Seeing a little girl and dog get brutally murdered is overkill for any film. They were cheap shock tactics.8.) The scene with the priest getting knocked on his butt by the swarm of flys was perhaps the most idiotic of the film. The audience actually laughed at that.9.) MTV special effects just don't work anymore. They're unimaginative and ineffective. How manytimes are you going to show us that violently shaking evil face?

This movie was trueley excellent. Ryan Reynold is great as a man slowley losing his mind, he should keep doing serious roles. this is based on a true story of a house that literally drove a boy to kill his family, then one year later drove a man George Lutz to try and kill his family. this house is pure evil and should have been torn down. but you need to think about something. Does the house really manipulate and drive people to kill, or does it unleash the primitive violent fury hidden in all of us covered by morals and emotion. I believe that as long as your on the land the house picks the one who is most suceptiable to rage, such as a man who has married into a family when the kids are still grieving the loss of their father and by result have a hate for george. the house knew who was the most manipulative and who would be the one whose mind was open enough to listen to the house. this movie is what defines true horror, not slasher, no real psycho or villain, only a man who was manipulated into reverting int primal instinct all who the house made him believe absolutely hated him. you know it was the house that was unleashing this because once george was off the property he was back to narmal, The saild off across the lake and never returned, I don't blame them. this movie is a 10 all the way this is what fear trueley is.",The Amityville Horror

Not that this one is a complex work of art, but it does play for scares and progress toward the inevitable quite without offense.Also someone noted the confusion of the story by having the girl hanging at one point. I noticed that strangeness too but it was abidable and excusable as the house's way of taunting the residents. Also how the family could have escaped at any time really, then couldn't but somehow could... I mean it has to be that way because a killer house would be inescapable, which doesn't allow for the ending, and a killer house that get's its way straight away wouldn't allow for a middle...

Anyway we're in an an overladen image-based epistemological paradigm at present where much if not all of our information is passed on through images instead of text--as a result there's less IMAGINATION (employment of speculative intellect) and audiences rely much more on empirical (what they can see) information which means that a lot less information is left to the imagination and there's much less character-driven movement of the story as compared to thirty and forty year old films.So what we have is a very graphic, very gimmicky movie on the surface like the '70s exploitation posters proclaim about the films they advertised (this film will give you SHOCK AFTER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK . . .

Then a dialogue ensues during which the kid asks him if he has to call him daddy now. The thing is, the couple is married. So they had to have been dating before, right? Shouldn't this conversation have taken place before? I always felt that the guy just got there, what with the mom asking her kids to give George a chance, which is so weird because, again, they're married, even if recently.The movie develops very well, with a couple's very real concerns with money and beautiful footage of the move-in. And then it begins getting sloppy again. I never figured out who did what. Both adults seemed to always be at the house except to run errands. The husband is supposed to have a 'business' which he runs from the basement but I never got what it was.There's just too much silliness going through the movie for me to take it seriously. The man is clearly a threat to her kids when he is in the house and never once did Kathy ask him why he behaved like that when they were out, or try and approach the subject at all. Towards the end, she starts running around like crazy instead of getting help. Seriously, you just figured out there is major evil at play here and you go and face it on your own?There's suspense, there's definitely horror and there is so much potential for a good story here, particularly with the connection between Chelsea and Jodie, what is afflicting Jodie, the explanation for the evil, the degeneration of the the main character throughout the movie and even the house/grounds themselves. Reynolds was so good in his role but as the narrative didn't flow and everything felt staged it just didn't deliver. Another horror let down for me.For the record, I did not watch the original version. Maybe it's better.",The Amityville Horror
188,reelred13,Exactley what i expected,8,18 April 2005,"The film was predictable, i know its a remake but i mean predictable in the way that i knew how they were going to scare us and when they were going to scare us. But, i still enjoyed it. The acting is semi over the top, but this is a horror movie so i can't complain to much. The film starts off kind of cheesy and is saved by the humor of Ryan Reynolds. Of course his humor changes to a very creepy and good performance similar to Jack Nicholsan in The Shining. Mellisa George does a nice job of playing the distressed mother and wife, and has some pretty good scared facial expressions. The kids are OK but they seem like there reading off cue cards the whole movie. In the original film you didn't see the ghost and now the ghost are all over the place. The film have a semi stylized look as did Texas chainsaw massacre that kind of gives it a look that puts you in a semi dream like state. All in all the film was very typical, but is saved by Ryan and Mellisa's performances and a very clean and sleek look.",The Amityville Horror
189,ShanTeaTime,Another Horror Remake That's Not Worth Your Time,2,13 April 2020,"I think Ryan Reynolds is a great actor...when it comes to quirky comical characters. Who the hell casted him in this film? I just want to talk to them and understand what was going through their head other than bringing in audiences for him. Though I don't think he was the worst aspect of this film, he definitely wasn't positiv either.So this film is based off of a Warren's paranormal case, including murderous events of a family and an apparent possesion. It's actually a really fascinating but tragic story of history and somehow this movie ended up mind numbingly boring. It moves at a snail's pace, nothing happens except for cheap jump scares and worn out plot devices. No innovation to be seen. Because this was created before the Conjuring films, it's clear that there wasn't any director that could handle any of the Warren's subject material.Honestly, even if you're a die-hard horror fan I wouldn't suggest this to you. There's no substance to it and far better horror films do exist and they're out there! You just really have to search for them. Steer away from Americanized remakes or attempts, they usually suck and don't utilize what truly can frighten us within film. In this case the ""original"" film wasn't good either, so double fail.",The Amityville Horror
190,VinceRocca,Excellent Horror movie.,10,23 April 2005,"I saw this last week and loved it so much, I returned this week to see it again. Thing is, I'm not the type who re-watches movies. I usually see them once, but Amityville. It is such a well constructed horror that I wanted to enjoy it again.I really can't compare this to anything that has been done lately. It definitely has a unique feel to it. The way horror use to make you feel, back in the day. I wouldn't say it's old school, but it gave me the creeps the same way Friday the 13th, Poltergeist, and Children of the corn first did in theaters so many years ago.Ryan Reynolds was great in Van Wilder and is excellent in Amityville, although each performance is nothing alike. I won't say he's proved himself, because he had nothing to prove. He's a great actor.I had wanted to focus my career on comedies, but after watching Amityville, I'm rethinking horror.Go see this, it'll scare the sh*t out of you, and send chills up your spine.",The Amityville Horror

192,jonathan45,Don't put the girl on the roof!,4,29 January 2007,"Mediocre remake of the 1979 original. The young couple look too MTV pretty to be working stiff parents. The only way the dad could get a physique like that would be to lift weights all day and night, if he was a real building contractor he'd have big shoulders and forearms and probably a gut from eating fast food on the job, he looks more like a male model. In keeping with modern films there is little or no tension in the script, where showing a psychological breakdown of the father and its effects on the family was needed we get CGI and cheap 'cat jumping from the cupboard' scares. The babysitter in the skimpy outfit was egregious, would she really wear an outfit like that to look after young kids?, she might as well say to the parents 'after you leave my boyfriend is climbing in the back window and were going to have sex in your marital bed while your kids raid the fridge for alcohol' no parent would let her look after their children dressed like that. The acting was competent, Mellissa George is a talented actor and does her best with a weak script, the fathers breakdown came too quickly and the family put up with far too much supernatural activity before acting on it. The big shock for me though came on the DVD extras, the young girl is asked to perform a stunt i wouldn't put an experienced stunt person through, winched up to one hundred feet in the air and asked to walk along the top of the house barely held secure by a thin safety line it had me watching through my fingers. Since they used Cgi through out the film surely they could have used these effects to create a false impression of height and kept the kid on the ground, her mum seemed more interested in getting it done and dusted!, another poor fame kid on the path to skid row thanks to a pushy stage mum!.",The Amityville Horror
193,p_jones92,What a joke!,2,26 May 2008,"Honestly I don't know what the makers were thinking when they tried to take on remaking a horror classic. They clearly didn't think the original could've been that good, because nothing in this version is similar to it, not even the story.The original of course was supposedly based on a true story, which many have debated as to whether it actually was true or not, but at least the movie had an element of realism in it, in that you felt for the family, believed in their love for one another, and the scares were bumps in the night, strange noises, and glimpses of demonic shapes and beings. What you would imagine a haunting to be.The new version dumps all of that, and goes straight for the CGI gore/schlock fest. It's funny how the opening credits say ""based on a true story"" when none of the events are anywhere near what the real Lutz's claim they were in their book, this movie has completely made up a whole new set of events to fit in with the CGI/gore fest that today's audience supposedly craves, and it borders on the diabolical and at times hysterically funny.In this version, the ""imaginary friend"" is not a demon, but one of the children killed in house before the Lutz's moved in. And it's not even shocks and bumps and noises from the kid, the kid is there for all to see, trying to strangle and kill the others. The Lutz's own child tries to throw herself of the top of the house, which is completely made up and not remotely close to any event the real Lutz's claim. The famous scene of the flies in the house with the priest has been completely re-imagined, to have thousands of CGI flies filling the house, causing the priest to flee in desperation with the Lutz's chasing after him. George Lutz nearly kills his wife by chopping her up with the blades of his boat!? Again, completely made up an not remotely ""true"", and ridiculous to boot! It's like the makers have taken the story and thought it wasn't interesting enough and needed sexing up. An all time classic horror tale isn't interesting enough?????? Everything in this movie is sexed up. They have a scene with a baby sitter who's 20 and has boobs to make Marilyn Monroe blush come on to the 12 year old she's baby sitting, are you kidding me! It is sickening to watch, the director should be investigated for filming such a sick scene.In the original, there was a nice development of George Lutz descent into insanity well acted by Josh Brolin. In this, Ryan Reynolds just walks around topless most of the time showing off his abs, and his way of acting insane is to turn up the corner of his lip in a menacing way from time to time, and that's it. There's no progression to his insanity, one minute he's nice, the next, a complete loon! Melissa George walks around in a tight top a lot too, but in order to show any emotion she just says ""baby"" after every word or whispers a lot. And what the hell was that whole S&M inspired cellar sequence, with people in gimp masks being chained up by their flesh? In fact the only thing that's not sexed up in the movie is the chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George's characters. For people so deeply in love, they barely talk to each other or have any meaningful conversation, they are totally unbelievable as an on screen couple.This movie is terrible, it's all style and no substance. It's about how things look, not how they are. It's about fabricating a story from an original idea beyond all recognition and faking it, whilst not deeming the audience to have any intelligence whatsoever. It rides on the coat tails of the original movie, and tries to leech some credibility by doing so. This movie is a bad, bad joke.",The Amityville Horror
194,bhatian,Not too scary,5,21 July 2005,"I remember watching the 1979 version and thought that it was too scary for its time, but this remake has very few scenes in which you get scared. Most of the scary scenes were predictable and played very little with my fear. The actors were good especially Mellisa George who was able to carry the film forward and interesting. What I would really like to know is if this home still exists! If so, then I am sure it has become a attraction for many tourists and visitors alike.Art Direction in this film is excellent and well handled. Objects, space and settings were well organized based on the original script. Whereas the handling of cinematography seemed more closer to the making of music videos. The entire making of the film seems as though it was made by some new comers in the film industry, but yet the job was well done.In conclusion, if you have never seen the original 1979 version, then this film will keep you awake all night thinking of the living dead and evil around us rather than getting scared in our dark room while we sleep.SCORE: 5 out of 10.Take care, Mr. NEIL BHATIA",The Amityville Horror
195,Brent_P,Average horror flick relying too much on CGI and cheap tactics.,5,15 April 2005,"""Amityville Horror"" is a slightly scary movie that give you a jump or two, a few tense moments, some overacting and a predictable storyline. This films, along with many others, is filled with too many clichés and forgot what makes classic horror movies so frightening in the first place. Since this movie is set up on the serious, it's lack of fear can be critical. But with the theaters filled with mediocrity in the horror section, this one is somewhat satisfying.AH stars Ryan Renolds (""Van Wilder"") as George Lutz, a newly married contractor with 3 step children, who comes across house that has a bad history and easy price tag. Van Wilder decides to take the deal, disregarding the fact that a family was murdered in cold blood one year ago, moves in with trouble starting from Day 1.The film has a great opening revisiting the the events that occurred earlier with a ""Se7en""ish style, foreshadowing the events yet to come. The house seems to focus on Van Wilder with visions and premonitions as he struggles to interpret them and shows signs of possession with gradual homicidal thoughts. No one else with the exception of the youngest daughter is really subject to the house's hauntings while the rest of the Van Wilder family battles with his constant moods swings and the house's strange behavior. There are few new tactics used to make you jump coupled with a few predictable ones, but nothing was more disturbing than the fact that I was forced to see Van Wilder ripped naked torso throughout half the movie, to include chopping wood and running around in his pajama bottoms in the rain. To tell you the truth, I really had no idea SoloFlex machines were that popular in the 70's. Anyways his modesty in question was finally answered when the the half-naked, pot smoking babysitter they hired, with enough mascara on to chalk your pool cue, showed up at their door. Maybe that was all Van Wilder could afford, due to the fact he seemed to spend all his money on firewood and never worked throughout the whole movie.The real problem with this movie is that the director ""humanizes"" this film using the clichéd, ""creepy kid"" as a bridge to the supernatural and the living, as the youngest daughter befriends an imaginary friend. In the original movie this character was a pig, represented by glowing red eyes to convey a demonic presence. As always, anticipation of being scared is much scarier (ie, Hitchcock) than having a ghouly kid pop in and out of scenes and dashing by the camera at blurring speeds. Andrew Douglas was far often reliant on CGI and special effects to get the job done instead of focusing on the elements of fear itself like M. Knight Shyamalan.There are a few tense scenes and the ending was so-so, but I think it would have been a challenge to make riveting one. The movie does answer your questions about the plot to include the origin of the house's demonic state. The acting is above average, with a few over dramatic moments and a few scene that will insult your intelligence, but overall it's a decent scary flick compared to the recent ones. But this is definitely not a classic and I recommend something like ""The Shining"" instead.",The Amityville Horror
196,horrorflicklover,"Definitely has it's problems, but it's a solid film overall",7,31 October 2013,"One thing I need to make clear before I go any further is this: I don't believe that the Amityville Horror is a true story. I'm just as much of a paranormal guru as the next guy. But that doesn't mean that I will believe any story that comes down the pike. There's simply been too much legitimate criticism of the story for me to believe that it happened. This, coupled with subsequent owners claiming no paranormal activity in the house, lead me to believe that it was a very fascinating, but fictional story. And it's a damn good one.So with that, I think it's imperative to understand that what's wrong with this film is just what's wrong with previous Amityville media: That it purports to be based on a true story. Since I believe this to be a lie, I judge this solely as a work of fiction.So what exactly is so much different from the book, or even the first film? George Lutz turning in to John from ""The Shining"" was largely invented for this version. And Jodie (the invisible ghostly friend of the daughter) being revamped in to the ghost of a DeFeo family member, and trying to trick Chelsea (her name in this film) to kill herself on separate occasions. And the dog dying. So three things that change, one of them working with the source material considerably. Read the synopsis' for either of the former media, and tell me what else is so much different.Now, are these big differences? Well, some of them do drive the plot, and that turns it in to a different film in a lot of aspects. I can understand the criticism. It can be enough to leave a bad taste in the mouths of the purists, sure. For instance, read my review of Rob Zombie's Halloween. Otherwise, they included a lot of the elements of the previous Amityville stories in this film. The red eyes, green slime, flies, sullen attitudes, 3:15, Native American deaths, etc.Escaping that, how does the rest of this movie fare? Honestly, pretty well. The execution, writing, acting, visuals, I think they're all pretty solid. I think Ryan Renolds played his character particularly well, and it's the standout of the entire film. I don't feel like there was anything that left me shaking my head. Well perhaps, that there was more to the story that they could have utilized. But it's not as if there already wasn't a lot of meat to it.So it all comes down to a few plot changes, ranging from significant to insignificant, all depending on how you personally view it. That's all perfectly understandable. For me, it wasn't particularly bothersome. This is a pretty good movie. But you won't like it if you're looking for a more accurate re-telling of the original story. Just a few changes that can irritate you.",The Amityville Horror
197,Davyd420,Remade to perfection!,8,27 May 2005,"This movie is without a doubt one of the best thrillers I have been to see in a long time. It seems today that Hollywood is in a frenzy to remake as many of the old 1970's and 80's horror classics as they can. The last horror remake that I enjoyed was Dawn of the Dead, though this film wasn't scary, it did pack a punch that made it one hell of an entertaining film. The Amityville Horror original did absolutely nothing for me, but this modernized version with Ryan Reynolds made me leave a light on when I went to bed that night. I recall having to fall asleep to The Disney Channel, if that tells you anything. This movie was your typical snowball, it started out pleasant and then just kept coming at you getting bigger and bigger and bigger, while I kept sinking further and further and further down into my seat. I don't think I had one fingernail left after the movie was over. All I have to say is, ""That's how you make a scary movie!"" Don't take my word for it, go and see this film.

199,knight110tim,Enjoyable reworking of an iconic dud,7,26 January 2006,"A classic haunted house yarn with solid performances from the cast - young and old, Amityville Horror (2005) is not a subtle, psychological horror but a balls-out, in-yer-face monster picture with the vengeful ghosts and demons appearing on screen from the moment the Lutz family arrive at their new home.Although it claims to be based on a true story no real attempt is made to keep the mayhem within the bounds of reality and George's rapid descent into insanity isn't so much an homage to Nicholson in The Shining as a parody. Ryan Reynolds is superb as the troubled head of his step-family and while best known for his light-hearted roles shows here he can turn charm to menace at the flick of a switch.Amityville is the least well-respected of the clutch of iconic horrors from the 1970s and has spawned some truly awful sequels, but this remake does the story proud, reinventing it for a multiplex audience used to glamorous leads and stories told through OTT gore and special effects.There's nothing really original here and the 2005 film ticks all the boxes for haunted house clichés e.g. spooky faces at windows, erratic plumbing, moving furniture, clocks stopping etc but does it with a brazen panache and lack of pretencion that makes the film enjoyable for what it is.",The Amityville Horror

202,Moonhawk1975,"Very, very disappointing",3,17 April 2005,"It's a shame this movie is not better. I have really enjoyed Hollywood's recent trend of remaking older horror movies; today's technology has allowed for much better effects and camera work. I can't really say whether they are scarier or not, in that it is a rare film that is able to scare me. In this case, the effects get in the way. The original was a bit cheesy and not really very scary. But, it was good. This remake is rather mean, not really very scary. And it is not good.After a brief opening sequence in which we see the murders which occurred in the house the year before, we meet George and Kathy Lutz (Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George) and her three kids. They are just newly married (after her first husband's death) and on the lookout for a bigger house. They find it in the large, spooky house on Long Island. After moving in, George slowly begins to feel the evil influence in the house and gradually goes insane. Everyone else pretty much sits around waiting for him to yell at them. Loud noises, choppy camera-work and special effects pad out the first hour or so. We get three scenes which try to explain the haunted forces in the house, but they are brief and until the 28th day (the final 15 minutes of the movie), Kathy really doesn't seem to realize something is happening in the house. It's almost as if the filmmakers forgot they were actually making a movie in the middle of all the special effects.Perhaps I am judging to harshly against the memory of the original. But, I blame the filmmakers for this. Gone is the priest trying to convince his superiors that something sinister is happening; here he gets two scenes that are really quite pointless, except to set the pacing for the conclusion. Gone are the supporting players; no friends, no aunt. This creates a claustrophobic feel to the proceedings. Gone is the well, hidden under the basement stairs; here we get the hidden room (last seen in the sequel/prequel to the original) and some new explanations on what happened therenot very convincing here, but would make a good movie of their own. This was a big misstep, but not as bad as the depiction of Jody. The creepiest thing of the original has been changed to just another ghost for the remake.On a final note, this movie is very loud. Now and then we get horror movies that bore us and then throw a loud noise on the soundtrack to keep us awake. I guess I should be grateful here; I would have been mad at myself for paying $6.50 to take a nap and the movie was not compelling enough to hold my interest.",The Amityville Horror
203,davidsawyer-me,Seriously lacking,3,22 February 2012,"Even though it seemed to have a lot of elements of a good movie this fell flat on it's face. As remakes go or what ever this continuation was of the Amityville saga it was terrible. I watched this last Halloween with a friend because we got in the October mood. Well, this movie was one big disappointment. Also I am getting so sick of Hollywood leaning on CGI as a crutch for everything they do. No matter how detailed the CGI is it always seems rather cartoonish and continues to break the 4th wall. I know this saves money on budget and allows them to do stuff that they couldn't otherwise do with props or real special effects, but I just don't like CGI unless the entire movie is one of those CGI Animated movies which is meant to look like a glorified cartoon, or an episode of some sci fi movie in which the laser beam is CGI. Anyway, This movie is like chewing your favorite piece of gum but it's the sugar free kind. Sure it still tastes like strawberry and it still tastes sweet, it even chews like the real thing, but in your mind you since that something is amiss, you feel that something is wrong. You just know that it's fake. Just like a fake piece of gum this movie seemingly has most of the elements of a good movie but something is missing from the acting, the filming, the script, the house, the props, but you just can't place your finger on it. You just know that it's missing. Have you ever bought a cheap Family Dollar brand of Kool Aid. It may have a vibrant pink, red, or purple color. It may mix well. It may smell super sweet. But when you drink it, well... it tastes bland and ambiguous. You think to yourself ""hmmm if I wasn't told this was Cherry and if it wasn't Red I couldn't tell what flavor this was supposed to be"". It has a faint, vague and ambiguous flavor that without the dye and perfume you could not discern what flavor it mimics. The 2005 Amityville Horror is nothing more than a cheap dollar store knock off of the real thing.",The Amityville Horror
204,TheScottman,"Hate to be negative, but...",3,3 May 2006,"When this movie came out, I was kinda happy. I've watched the original and didn't think it was great. So I thought maybe with our technology now a days, this film could be better than the original.Wow! how I was wrong. The movie was just another example of how Hollywood changes stories to make them more suitable for them to make. This is a true story, how can you change it around? The beginning is suppose to be the scariest part, but in this movie it was just pointless.They should have spent a little more time on casting, just because, nobody fits their parts. I can't imagine being afraid of Ryan Reynolds and I think the kid that played Billy Lutz was much older than he should have been. I didn't think much of Melissa George as Kathy Lutz, but that could have been because the writing for her was pretty bad.This is not the movie's fault, but when I went to see it I had this girl behind me was talking about how she was sick and she needed to throw up. That took me out of the movie watching mood. Please people, if you are sick or feel like you're going to be sick stay home or leave the theater silently and go home. Don't announce it.To my understanding both movies are not what really happened, only certain parts.

205,elsbed-1,"A+ for props, settings D- for everything else",4,17 April 2005,"I had been looking forward to this movie for a while now. As a fan of the original ""Amityville"" I was hoping for something that at least followed the book. The previews I saw looked promising. But, of course I was disappointed...way disappointed. While this wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, there were a lot of turn-offs. To begin, it reminded me of a ""Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie"" which is not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I expect to see when I go to the theater. The acting was pretty dreadful. The actor who played George was particularly over the top. But what was most lacking for me, in terms of scariness, was the lack of emphasis on the house's attacking the Catholic Church via Father Delaney, the aunt who was a nun, etc. The family in this version seems to have no religion until Cathy finds a random priest towards the end who is attacked by some computer generated fly swarm when he goes to the house. Nothing was mentioned about the psychological distancing of the Lutz's from their family and friends, which might have added something. The subplot of the kid's real father who supposedly died was very annoying and didn't add much. In the end, lots is done for shock value only. For example, why did George have to kill Harry the dog in this one? It added very little except for some ghostly barks coming from the boathouse later. The secret slaughterhouse under the house at the end was so crazy it was laughable. The only redeeming aspect of this movie, IMO, was the attention to detail as far as 70's-era props...so many movies skimp here, which drives me crazy when watching something that is supposed to place in the past. I was appreciative of small stuff like the 70's coffee pot, a box of Super Sugar Crisp as well as the hairstyles and other small details. The house in this movie was just gorgeous. But a bit mansion-like for what it was supposed to be. In all, not a total waste of time, but someday it will probably be rerun on the Sci Fi channel, where it will feel right at home.",The Amityville Horror
206,kirkwuk,"Really surprised, better than the original",9,22 April 2005,"As an Amityville fan of ten years, I can honestly say I was very surprised by this movie. Hollywood have made some right stinkers when it comes to horror, and I was expecting this remake to be cheap, tacky, waste of time. Some Amityville fans do consider it to be - however how exactly do you expect a 2005 haunted house movie to do justice to one that was made 30 years ago, when this genre was still in its prime? There are always going to be those fans, whom have the huge chip on the shoulder, nit-picking, elitist attitude which is actually destroying THEIR chance to enjoy the film.The 2005 remake wastes little time in getting into the haunting theme. This isn't bad after all, since the original slowed the scenes down to snails pace with what we already knew - the house is haunted, evil is lurking - what is the purpose in showing Kathy Lutz looking shocked and terrified for five minutes in every scene? Whereas the original 1979 Amityville Horror built up the atmosphere, the remake uses some shocking imagery which leaves little to the imagination and had me jumping out of my seat in the cinema. I was surprised at this myself as I don't buy shock tactics - but what this film does is actually frightening, really playing with the viewers mind that what can't be seen in the shadows is something truly evil and malicious. The acting is actually flawless for the most part, and betters the 1979 film. Saying this, the acting wasn't that great back then.Let's face it, the 1979 film wasn't that great, and in fact the sequel has many advantages over it. In fact, the new Amityville Horror may be the best Amityville film I've ever seen. It does not waste time, which is one of the flaws of the Amityville series - where we have to witness the victims of the demons slowly coming to their senses. It uses it's 90 minutes wisely and nothing seems overly long, with the exception of the ending. It's a nasty, malicious haunted house film which can work in a ""jump out of your seat"" way and psychological sense. Without a doubt they picked the right story to do this, as the original Jay Anson book is without a doubt the most flawless haunted house tale of all. I feel the need to congratulate all those who worked on the remake. I really can't wait for if they make a sequel.",The Amityville Horror

There should be a class action suit against MGM & Andrew Douglas for false advertising. It takes the 'premise' of the first movie - a murder in a home leaves it haunted - and then changes everything. Jody the pig? Nah, here its Jody the murder victim. Instead of shadows and red eyes from a distance we have full fledged sightings of the little girl. It is so badly done its pathetic - a first year film student would not go so heavy handed.The rest of the film is just as bad - there is no imagination, no thrills, not an original thought in the hour & a half.

209,noxhitman,Nothing but a palely entertaining show,2,9 September 2005,"Seeing this film was most definitively a bad choice amongst all other films in theaters at the moment. If you're in for some good special effects and screams from teenagers in the seat behind, well then maybe this is your film. I was in for a good horror movie, which knowing from the hype it would be not, but nonetheless ""watchable"" in terms of plot and acting. For the most part the movie focused on the 'husband' which is in fact a comedy actor that really doesn't fit the part, and as expected the wife is indeed hot as we are used to nowadays. You would wish the clichés had stopped there, but no, they keep on coming for the rest of film up to the end of it which in my opinion was dumb and very very weak.I should mention that in this movie there are things like a dead little girl, dead people in the basement, ghosts appearing in the mirror, and the list goes on... In a nutshell this movie was kind of entertaining in a manner that it is actually well made in terms of special effects and is fast-paced, but the story is totally irrelevant and the acting is very very poor. I would recommend you skip this one and go watch something different for a change.",The Amityville Horror
210,terrors89,Decent Horror flick copying stuff from Japanese imports.,6,21 April 2005,"**A few spoilers, but not many*** Yet another remake of an older horror movie, this remake of the 1979 film of the same name is better than the original but it is not going be remembered for anything extraordinary. The best thing about the movie is the performance by Ryan Reynolds. He did an outstanding job. The movie was scary but not terrifying.This movie is very much loosely based on the events that happened to the real life George and Kathy Lutz in Amityville New York, in December 1975. The Lutz's had bought a home that had been the place where a whole family was murdered by the older son, who claimed while he was on trial that he heard voices that told him to murder his family. The Lutz's were told what happened before they purchased the house and went ahead and did it anyway. Twenty eight days after moving in, George Lutz left all of his possessions, including clothes, and took his family to relatives and abandoned the house.The movie begins by following the elements of the true story, including showing the murder of the Defeo family by Ronald. George, played by Ryan Reynolds (Blade III), and Kathy, played by Melissa George (Down with Love,) Lutz move into the house even though they are told by the realtor what happened a year earlier. Almost immediately, George begins seeing visions and Kathy's daughter Chelsea, gets a new friend named Jodie. It turns out that Jodie is the daughter of the Defeo's and the last child killed by Ronald. George meanwhile begins to be possessed by the house and his demeanor changes over the course of 28 days. Kathy goes into town and finds out that there was some kind of torture chamber for Indians in the basement of the house. However by then George has become possessed and is going to try and kill the family.Scare wise there is nothing new. It uses lots of shadows moving around and weird sounds and large thumps and so on that are your standard in haunting movies. It was unnerving to see the little girl as apart of the scare tactics. The very first night in the house she appears to George as being hung above the bed. Movies are starting to use little girls and children in general as tools to scare which is good because of every one's nature to want to protect them and to show them in scenes of death add to that fear. The bad thing is that if Hollywood is forced to use these children as scare tactics, they must be running out of ideas to scare people with.I am finding it interesting that Hollywood is also remaking horror movies from the 60's and 70's. With the previously released Dawn of the Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and the soon to be released House of Wax, it would appear that other than the Japanese invasion of horror stories, Hollywood is now remaking stuff that was already done. I guess they are running out of ideas, or there is no one in Hollywood with original thoughts. Which means in another 10 years we will have remakes of Friday the 13th and Halloween, I weep for the future of Hollywood horror.Ryan Reynolds was a bright spot in the movie. He did a great job with creating a character that must become evil from good. Playing a character that is real and alive must be difficult for an actor, but he makes him believable. Lutz's character is the star of the show as is the little girl(s). Both Chloe Moretz and Isabel Conner do great job as Chelsea Lutz and Jodie Defeo respectively. Every time Jodie showed up, I wasn't scared as much as I was angry that a child was hurt. Still it was a good effort by both and hopefully both of these girls can continue to get more jobs if for nothing else than to give Dakota Fanning a break so she can go to school.The script followed your basic house haunting movie. Screenwriter Scott Kosar appeared to me to venture very far away from the ""true"" story of the Lutz's. George Lutz offered to be a consultant for the show but was declined. Probably because Kosar's script looks like it stole some ideas from our Japanese friends across the Ocean. As does the director Andrew Douglas, who steals from Japanese movies, particularly The Ring and/or The Grudge. The little girl Jodie is all black and looks like she was drowned with a hole in her head, even though she was shot with a shot gun in her bedroom. Not very consistent.There was some cheese in the movie. The whole scene with the babysitter who was probably 19 or 20, first hitting on a 13 year old kid, and then getting trapped in the closet that was where Jodie was found dead was completely a cheap scare scene and not very good. The very last scene where Jodie is standing in the house all alone, crying because the Lutz family left, and then get grabbed by ghostly hands and pulled through the floor was not scary or unnerving, just stupid.But the movie is not that bad. There are some scenes that are pretty good. Go ahead and see the movie, there are a lot worse movies out there, but it is not the best. The movie should be good for a scare or two for your girlfriend, maybe even boyfriend.",The Amityville Horror
211,curtman2,"Abysmal, Derivative Mess of Horrifying Proportions",3,27 April 2005,"Apparently the standard for horror films these days is all shock and no suspense, mind-numbing contrivance over crucial plot development: ""The Amityville Horror"" is yet another abysmal failure that is more content to provide a cheap thrill here and there than it is to adhere to the conventions of suspense-crafting and any cinematic development whatsoever. Rather than immersing us into the psyches of the inhabitants of the estate, ""Amityville"" plunges us into a catastrophically disheveling, incoherent frenzy of camera distortions and grotesque facades, desperately plodding for one shocking sequence after another, entirely lacking the psychological/character development of nay, a classic for the genre, ""The Shining"". And what's even more insulting to a viewer with any expectations whatsoever for a decent horror picture is that here is a film that is ostensibly derived from a myriad of far superior horror pictures (that it is a remake of a mediocre horror is enough to be said), while supplanting the most awfully banal and contrived ""scares"" (bathtub horrors, closet snatching, etc.) for a potentially engaging story of a family demonized by a possessed house that, if handled even at modest cinematic value, could've made for a psychologically exciting horror. Instead, what we're left with in this ""Amityville Horror"" is cardboard, barren acting (Ryan Reynolds, unlike Jack Nicholson in a much similar, yet significantly more evolved horror, is astonishingly unconvincing as a man being driven to madness, and his character is hardly developed enough to appreciate this descension), while Melissa George is equally impassioned as his much-too placid wife who can't even carry a shriek for a scare. I can hardly decide which is more maddening: the agony of standing scene after scene crashing and burning into dire implausibility and predictability, or the inanity of the characters, perhaps casualties of a platitudinous screenplay, who haven't the acuity to discern right away that they have entered ground zero into a world of hell. Perhaps the only workings of this abysmal, derivative, and pathetically predictable mess are some clever editing work in scarce areas. Otherwise, what can be said about ""Amityville"" that hasn't been exhausted in countless other disappointing attempts at shock without suspense; a bang and a shriek around every corner, albeit not a scintilla of plot or character development. I don't typically weigh horror films as great as serious cinematic pieces, yet I do expect the film to provide me a reason to shriek at its scares; ""Amityville"" is unfortunately, a ""scarefest"" without coherence or reason. ""Get out while you still have a chance"", out of seeing ""Amityville"", that is... *1/2 out of ****",The Amityville Horror
212,lhommeinsipide,This film isn't just bad. It's a disaster and I am perplexed as to why people praised it.,2,15 March 2006,"Absolutely no effort is made to give the characters any sense of reality. At the beginning, we're presented with a series of nauseatingly cheery family scenes - as if they are meant to mean something to us. Evidently, the director is trying to build up a form of security which breaks down through the course of the film due to some supernatural being. But it doesn't work. None of it does. We aren't given enough time to care about the characters. Maybe more time would have helped - or maybe the characters were so fundamentally loathsome that we were willing them to die as soon as possible. Only twenty minutes in, we get our first ghost, the token creepy little girl, accompanied by loud noises which were clearly intended to make us jump out of our seats. Ooooh, I'm terrified. And from then on, it goes downhill. The fridge magnets, the babysitter... dear god, I want those two hours of my life back.",The Amityville Horror
213,Billybob-Shatner,"Certainly better than the original, not bad in and of itself",6,20 October 2005,"It's hard to write off a movie thats so technically impressive... From sound to production design, editing, the new Amityville Horror is quite compelling... And until its final act, the writing isn't half bad either. The director packs the film with atmosphere, and for what it is, a fairly cheesy horror movie, it works well. The last act degenerates into the standard fare from many other movies, and loses even more credibility, but even then, its not bad. The performances are reasonable, the pacing is tight, the visualization is inspired. The story, while not bad, can't help feeling like what it is, a stretched truth, and... a bit dopey. The visuals of torture from the 1600's look more at home in a nine inch nails music video, than something from the actual time period. If your in the mood for a cheesy, relatively well written, and well made horror movie, look no further. And to be honest, it's still more plausible than the Ring. :)3/5",The Amityville Horror
214,hellboundsyco,"only a few Miner spoilers here, nothing to serious",8,1 December 2005,"Well, if you have read any of my other reviews, you will certainly know that i am a huge fan of the amityville movies (except amityville curse, god that is a crap movie). i have managed over the last 5 years or so to see all the amityville movies (especialy amityville dollhouse, my favourite). But this remake of the original 1970s Amityville horror surpasses all its predecessors. I know that many people will disagree by saying ohhh its all special effects the acting crap and the story has been lost, but in my opinion the special effects are kept quite minimalist and the true tenseness is still there. there are lots of jumpy bits which really made me and my friend scream ( specially the werewolf creature in the barn oh my god scary stuff) but that aside the acting is fantastic the effects top the movie and the story if anything is a lot more scary then the original. if like me you love a good scream then watch this film you will not be disappointed.p.s. just had a thought what if they start to remake the other 7 amityville movies, oh no, i can see this heading down a black hole.",The Amityville Horror
215,horsecrazy6791,One of my favorite horror movies,10,6 November 2005,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to see this movie in theaters, but the very day it came out on DVD I went out and bought it. After I took it home and watched it, ""The Amityville Horror"" became one of my newest favorite horror films.In the original movie, there is a somewhat demonic pig, instead of Jodie, the ghost of the previous little girl who was brutally murdered in the house, along with the rest of her family. I think that was a pretty good idea to have Jodie in the movie instead of the pig, even though a scary little girl is quite common for horror films. It was a bit more realistic, and relates more to the true story of the Amityville murders.As for all the actors and actresses, I found that they all did a really good job. Melissa George played Kathy Lutz, a woman who basically wants what's best for her family, and wanted to buy the house in Amityville because she thought it would be a great place to raise her three kids. Ryan Reynalds (George Lutz) agreed after a lot of thought to buy the house that his wife wanted so badly. Throughout the movie, he seems to be affected by the demonic presences in the house, but refuses to believe that houses can be bad. When his kids try to convince him of that, he insists that houses don't kill people. People kill people.The three kids also play their characters parts really well. Jesse James (Billy Lutz) is Kathy and George's oldest child. He has a hard time dealing with his real father's death, and because of that, doesn't take too much of a liking to his step dad George. Billy usually gets blamed for everything that is caused by the evil presences in the house. Jimmy Bennent plays Micheal Lutz, the second oldest child. He also believes that the house is bad. One night when he went into the bathroom, he turns the tap on to find blood dripping out the faucet instead of water. Seconds later, the ghost of a murdered Indian appears beside him, although he doesn't see it. but the blood was enough to send him running back to his room. The youngest Lutz child, Chelsea, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, is the one who makes friends with Jodie, the girl who lived in the house before her, and was murdered in her closet.One of my favorite scenes was when Chelsea goes upstairs to get her teddy bear, and climbs up onto the roof of the house. When her parents come home, they notice their daughter's teddy bear fall to the ground. they look up and see Chelsea walking across the narrow top of the roof, waving and calling out to them. Frantically, George climbs up a ladder to try and get her, while Kathy runs upstairs and gets on the roof the same way her daughter did. She calls Chelsea to come to her, but Chelsa insists that she must go with Jodie, and jumps off the end of the roof. Luckily, Kathy catches her by her pink overalls. She holds on to her as long as she can, but when she finally lets go, George catches Chelsea from on the balcony. I thought this part in the movie was pretty cool because Chloe actually walked up on that high roof all by herself with nothing but two thin cables holding her up.This movie has no scenes that are useless and boring. It keeps your attention the whole way through, and your eyes glued to the TV screen. So if you haven't already seen this movie, it's definitely worth it. Go out and buy it, because it's probably not going to be one you'll want to see only once. 10/10.",The Amityville Horror

217,CharteredStreets,The Shamityville Horror,2,16 April 2005,"""The Amityville Horror"" is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, and signifying money. It's a remake of the 1979 'classic' which was based on Jay Anson's book. That movie came out about the same time that the 'true story' was exposed as a hoax, but the remake still proudly boasts that it is 'based on a true story.'I am not particularly bothered about the story's authenticity, however; I'll leave that to the conspiracy theorists and ghost-hunters. What I am bothered about is the movie's complete lack of originality, interest, fear, atmosphere, talent, believable dialogue and story development. It looks like it's been put together from spare parts of other horror movies. It is directed by Andrew Douglas, but it could have been made by a computer.Here are a few of the obligatory horror scenes the movie employs: 1. Axes being dragged along the ground. 2. TV and radio signals with subtle subliminal messages (e.g. 'kill them'). 3. Shots of something moving past the camera quickly, as a SCREECH! Fills the soundtrack; why are ghosts always so conscious of where the camera is? 4. The old reliable Indian Burial Ground. 5. The little girl who makes friends with the ghost that no one else can see.And so on and so forth. I can imagine a movie that uses these clichés and is still effective, but this movie has nothing but clichés; although they are based on real people, the characters in the movie are provided with such dull dialogue that we never care about them whatsoever, which is perhaps why I found the film so lacking in scares.But let me backtrack a bit. The film opens with the deaths of the family who used to live in a big creepy house with windows that look like glowing eyes. Ronald DeFeo hears voices in his head and kills his family. The movie decides, funnily enough, not to include the fact that the real DeFeo confessed that he made the 'voices' story up to help his case, and thus subtly justifies the fact that he cold-bloodedly killed six members of his family. This sequence is filled with so many flashes and loud sound effects that I felt as if I were having a migraine.One year later, the Lutz family moves in. They are shown in overhead helicopter shots as they drive along the winding roads, in what looks like a tribute to ""The Shining,"" the difference being that the shots lasted more than one second in the Kubrick's movie. As ominous music plays, the stepfather, George, looks up the stairs and seems somehow worried; maybe he can hear the music too. They learn of the murders, but are not too bothered. 'Houses don't kill people; people kill people,' says George. Oh, the ignorant fool. The house is probably the best character in the movie; about four times, we get the same shot of the camera tilting up to show us the house (sometimes with some completely redundant time-lapse photography), with its creepy eye-windows.'Day One,' appears across the screen, and it took a huge effort for me to resist adding 'in the Big Brother House.' The family settles in, and that night, George and Kathy take part in a sex scene. It can't be said that they have sex, because when real people have sex, they're not so bothered about the way the light is hitting them. Anyway, George suddenly sees the girl from the DeFeo family behind his wife, hanging from the ceiling with a noose around her neck (screech!). He looks again, and she's gone. Since she was shot, and not hanged, I'm not sure what she was doing with that noose, but never mind.Soon the family finds itself in the middle of a loud, tedious horror movie. The father starts becoming a little disturbed, and carries the axe around a little too much. His eyes become blood shot, for some reason. He has visions and dreams about torture and death. Windows open and shut themselves. Fridge magnets get rearranged. George and Kathy return home one day to find their daughter, who has made friends with a ghost, on the roof (screech!). 'I think something is wrong here,' Kathy concludes. The audience giggles; here is a movie where every character is dumber than anyone watching it.Philip Baker Hall appears as a priest to exorcise the house. His attempt does not speak highly of the Catholic faith; the exorcism goes wrong, and he does a runner, telling Kathy to get the hell out of there. Even Philip Baker Hall, a fine actor, cannot make the dialogue sound as if it means anything.Also immensely irritating is the movie's choppy editing style. This movie has been edited to death. The shots are all about two seconds long, at most. The camera can't sit still. Since ""The Shining"" is clearly one of its influences, the director and editor should have paid more attention to Kubrick's long, eerie shots. It's the type of editing that is described as 'slick,' but I think it's just a cover up for the lack of anything interesting on the screen. It's quantity over quality.The biggest sin the movie commits is in being boring, I think. Once I got into the movie, and realised I was stuck with the 'slick' editing and boring characters, I gave up caring. The movie has a scene of gory fun where a babysitter gets locked in a cupboard, but little else to recommend it. If you like horror movies with lots of gore and nothing else, you might like it, but you'll still probably find it tediously unoriginal. When you hear the dog barking, do you think he'll come to a sticky end? When the family is being chased upstairs, as a storm rages outside, do you think they'll end up on the roof? Screech!",The Amityville Horror

The problem with this remake is the incredible short time they're trying to tell the story in. You don't really get to know the characters as good as you get to do in the original. It feels rushed.

224,matpinckney,Complete and gripping...,9,6 May 2005,"When I first saw adverts for 'The Amityville Horror', I sighed and thought it would just be another modern Hollywood remake of a classic film. Even though I had never seen the original, I knew its status, and immediately thought a remake was just another way of cashing in on a famous name.However, I ended up seeing it (and was actually quite pleased it was rated '15' rather than an '18' as the original had been.), and I could not have been more wrong.I was immediately impressed by the fact the story took place in the original 1970's era, rather than trying to update everything for the modern day. This effect was carried out with perfect subtlety (never once did I see something obviously thrown in because it came from the right year), assisted hugely by Peter Lyons Collister's cinematography. It was gentle, and not obviously 'horror', but yet built up perfectly to underline everything in the film.Certain shots verged on the genius, such as an early shot where Kathy Lutz looks up at the house. The sky behind is beautiful, and it is quite hard to imagine anything awry could take place here. Yet, a moment later when they find out about the earlier murders, a look back at the house, with exactly the same sky suddenly seems imposing and uncertain, only aided by a simple leaf blowing through.All of the performances are incredible, with particular credit going to Ryan Reynolds in his portrayal of George Lutz. From an early comic character, to becoming slowly more and more disconnected, the transformation is brilliant. Melissa George as his wife Kathy plays off his performance perfectly, rising above any female stereotypes associated with these types of films. All three of their children (Jesse James, Jimmy Bennet, and Chloe Moretz) are wonderful in their respective roles, each bringing their own thing to the table.I was also impressed by how much of the film took place during the day, without any loss of atmosphere. Normally, a film like this will rely on the dark to create the fear, but not here. The performances and situations themselves really shone here.High praise to Andrew Douglas for his creation.9/10",The Amityville Horror

227,Charlotte_Kaye,Annoying and monotonous,2,30 December 2005,"I'm not the biggest fan of the Amityville franchise, but this was just as bad as all the direct-to-video sequels. All it really manages to do is create an air of the unpleasant. Not scary or suspenseful or entertaining, mind you. Just unpleasant. It's boring and the characters are complete voids with no personality. You honestly don't care if someone plants an axe in any of their heads, and quite frankly, you wish Ryan Reynolds would do just that to the wife/mother character (Melissa George), who does some of the lamest, most pea-brained things imaginable. The supposed protector of her children ensures her own children's lives are constantly in danger because she refuses to leave the house or her husband. Maybe she should have sent them off to stay with a relative or take them to day care when things started to get shaky? If those were my children and I was so up my husband's rear end that I couldn't leave him for a couple of days, then I think I'd stay at home and take my chances and not insist my kids stick around too so that daddy has a chance to start swinging an axe at them.Though the production values are halfway decent, the direction, script and uneven acting ruin it. You think the director was more interested in making a Ryan Reynolds fetish video going by how much time he spends getting Reynolds out of his shirt to show off his six pack abs. So whatever, the guy spends a lot of time at the gym... Now put him in some halfway decent movie and give him a character to work with next time. Then possibly I could appreciate him as something more than a vapid pretty boy with questionable talent. Melissa George, who I believe is a TV actress, is awful. The kids did a decent job. Talented character actor Philip Baker Hall is shamefully wasted.",The Amityville Horror

I wasn't expecting much from this one, but was pleasantly surprised! For the first time in a long time, I was scared by a movie! There were a few ""cheep"" thrills. But there was also a really good tension created that kept you on your toes through the whole thing. And the characters were likable, so you were actually rooting for them.As we were leaving the theatre, everything I heard from the other members of the audience was positive. A lot of people said it was the scariest movie they had ever seen.There were a few cinematic flaws-- a little discontinuity, some wardrobe problems, but generally, this was a very good movie.8/10 for me.",The Amityville Horror
229,brenleyman,Amityville was trying to shoot for the stars,8,26 October 2005,"I have seen the original, and some of the remakes, and the old version takes a better look at the actual events the Lutz family claims to have happened in the house. I always come to the same conclusion, I have to visit 112 Ocean Drive to know the truth(The ACTUAL address of the real amityville house.) This film is a good compliment to the old version. It starts with the fateful night that started a world known urban legend that is caught between the real and the surreal. We are introduced to Ronald ""Butch"" Defeo, sitting in his basement, hearing a voice telling him to ""Katch 'em & Kill 'em"". He gives in, grabs a rifle, loads up, and ""goes hunting"". He kills his parents, brothers, and his sisters, telling one that he loves her, before he pops one into her.We are then taken one year into the future, where George and Kathy Lutz have bought the house. After they move in, they begin to see things that are beyond belief(I was scared s**tless from the first bathroom scene where the boy sees the Indian who was tortured to death.) After a while, strange things begin happening, in which the Lutz's oldest son, Billy, is blamed. The daughter claims to see the ghost of Jodie Defeo(Note: The original version said Jodie was a pig, and not a little girl.) George Lutz slowly slips into insanity, where he can never keep the windows shut, or the house warm. He migrates to the basement, and starts building things(An extra room, and COFFINS!) Kathy sees that all is not at peace in the house, and asks a priest to bless the house so the past spirits can move on. After only 5 minutes in the house, he is chased out. After 28 days, Kathy discovers the secrets of the house.NOTE: This next part is a spoiler of some history, and may not be entirely accurate.The house was built in the 1600's, being an Indian mission, where indians could be converted to Christianity. It was started be Reverend Jeremiah Katchem, who proceeded to torture and kill the indians. He killed himself, hoping to keep his soul on the ground forever. Katchem's spirit was joined by those of tormented indians. We fast-forward to the previous owners, the Defeo family. Ronald Defeo killed his family after 28 days in the house(coincidence?) He claimed to have seen horrible things, and heard voices, telling him to butcher his family. The weird feelings eventually caused him to migrate to the basement, where the horrible things and voices pestered him to the point where he killed his family. The soul of Jodie Defeo joins the house. Kathy, with this new knowledge, rushes home to get her family out. She gets home to find her husband, ready to slaughter his family like Ronnie Defeo had done. They are chased through the house, which proceeds to lock them in, and they are forced to escape through the roof. Goerge is eventually subdued, as Kathy, and her children proceed to leave the house and everything in it.This movie, as I stated earlier, was a great compliment to the original film, and had a lot of ground to cover. It is, of all things, inaccurate to the book the original was based off of. George Lutz is portrayed well, and the use of original Defeo investigation interviews is fabulous. 8/10.",The Amityville Horror

It's simply a way for greedy studio executives to cash in on gullible moviegoers, who they just know are going to spend their hard earned cash on watching these high profile horror films.You're lucky if these so called 'remakes' retain five percent relevance to the original movies they're meant to, in essence, be. And to make matters far worse, some of them would actually be quite good movies on their own merit if they were stand alone films (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre springs to mind, I quite liked that).If someone wants to make, as in this instance, a haunted house movie (and in the case of 'Dawn of the Dead' a zombie movie, etc), then just make a damn haunted house/zombie/vampire or whatever movie and stop pretending they're ridiculous, stupid, pathetic, pointless f****** remakes of classic films!

Unfortunately the story has already been told in several other movies, like Poltergeist for instance. If I was a movie director and I had a script like this in my hand, I wouldn't produce the movie, unless I could introduce something new in the base storyline; something, which hasn't been told, yet.

232,thumbworn,"Not the Worst Movie I've Seen, but...",5,17 August 2020,"Very mild spoilers included...Instead of waiting until the end to post a conclusion, I'll start right off by saying that the director made a mess of this film. There are too many random and modern types of monsters (for no reason) and jump-scares that are more suitable in movies like the remake of 13 Ghosts.I'm a fan of Ryan Reynolds and while his acting is fine here, I find myself unable to believe the character transition as the evil is slowly consuming him; that may be my own issue based on the other roles he has taken and his mastery of sarcastic humor. In comparison, James Brolin is very believable in the original as he is overtaken by the evil.There are multiple ""special effect"" type camera shots, such as slow motion and stuttering effects, scattered throughout that don't work well and pull your attention away from the experience.Some additional backstory was added for what seemed solely to serve as an excuse to add a few more monster and ""scary"" characters, which detract from the flow of the story.This film is set in the mid-70s, but very few of the hairstyles really seem to be appropriate. Some of the clothing doesn't seem quite correct either. One character wears multiple KISS shirts that are not only not era-correct, but also appear to be bootlegs not resembling any official KISS shirts I recall ever seeing.With the extra monsters, backstory, jump-scares, era-innapropriate hairstyles and clothing, and cheap-looking camera effects, the movie does not flow well and I was constantly pulled out of the experience as I was continually noticing all those things.I wanted to like this film, and while it's not the worst film I've seen, I won't likely watch it again despite owning it. There are far better movies out there starring Ryan Reynolds, and the original Amityville succeeds where this unfortunately falls short.",The Amityville Horror
233,steerpike_2002,Another limp Hollywood horror,5,18 April 2005,"This film is simply another nail in the coffin for the hopes of horror fans such as myself that an American cast and crew will deliver a genuinely frightful offering for our senses. 'The Amityville Horror' belongs to a growing collection of recent horror films from the USA such as the Ring remakes, 'Darkness Falls', 'Gothika', 'White Noise' etc which are seemingly designed only to make test audiences jump in the seats every so often. Only this can explain the barrage of loud noises and flashing images we seem to experience whenever a scary scene emerges from the otherwise mediocre dialogue and cinematography.What happened to the skillful build-up of tension created by effective use of location seen in films like 'Don't Look Now'? Or the feelings of unease experienced during 'Rosemary's Baby'? Special effects is the villain from this reviewer's perspective. Time and time again, 'The Amityville Horror' presents us with shocking images of the evil in the house. However, with no tension, fear, or suspense in place, all these images can be appreciated for is the technical expertise which went into making them.I only hope that audiences will begin to punish the Hollywood horror factory for this stream of limp attempts.",The Amityville Horror
234,jmcleod_5,Yawn,2,13 May 2005,"It's hard to believe the makers of this film even read the original book by Jay Anson. I'm no believer in the supernatural but I enjoy a good ghost story and that's exactly what the book gave you. The original movie wasn't bad but it failed to get across what the book was saying.This remake has very little from the book even though they claim it adheres closely to Anson's tale. Where's the pig with red eyes? Where's the bit with the front door wrenched off? What about the ceramic lion or the marching band or the red room in the basement?Don't even talk to me about the ending. He kills the dog then proceeds to go mad by trying to kill everyone. Where's that in the book?When are horror film-makers going to realize that not showing something, only suggesting it, is far more scary than shoving the blood and guts in your face. Showing the little girl in the rocking chair was a big mistake. The things that made films like the Omen and the Exorcist great weren't the gore or in your face deaths. In the Exorcist it was things like the clock stopping or the scratching noises in the attic. That is truly chilling.I keep going to see horror movies but am continually disappointed.

236,theantigaz,Horror by Numbers,2,17 April 2005,"Another day, another Hollywood re-make. The original Amyityville Horror was not a ground breaking horror movie, nor was it an especially good horror movie. The reason it was anywhere near successful was because it was apparently based on 'true' events that had gripped the nation through news reports and the notorious novel of the same name a few years earlier.So, out of any original ideas, the big wigs in Hollywood decided to dust of an old cult classic and give it the 21st century make over that no one really wanted. The result is a hit and miss, horror by numbers tale of a haunted house. The set pieces are all there, brief back story, quick introduction to characters, camera showing off the exciting sets and then on with the show! The show in this case being the usual 'jumpy' and 'shocking' sequences all modern horror films are obliged to contain. Quick flashes or glimpses of something scary, strobe lights and sharp blasts of music. The problem with modern horror movies is, they all use the same gimmicks to pull the audiences strings, and ultimately they get a little too predictable. This film has nearly all the usual tactics, scary reflections in mirrors, demisting foggy mirrors to reveal scary image, seeing weird stuff in windows from a distance, being grabbed in the bath, looking at something scary-looking back to realise its something normal. All the tried and tested horror movie tricks.This remake has its moments, to be honest the lead male, Ryan Reynolds is quite good. He does a convincing job of being intense and messed up in the head. Melissa George, does the usual running round and protecting her children bit (even though she looks unfeasibly young and pretty to be a widowed mother of three). The child actors pretty 2 dimensional and unconvincing though.The sets and special effects are good and the pace of the film is well timed, but unfortunately this is where the good points list ends.The back story is brief and any sub-plots are hardly explored at all and stand out more a lazy plot mechanisms than attempts to give the story depth. The film really comes crashing down in the third act though. The scare tactics are quite rightly turned up a notch, but unfortunately a frankly lame and recycled back-story is awkwardly injected to try and explain the scary goings on. Why Hollywood has to do this I do not know? When will they learn horror movie audiences don't need these lame attempts of plot reasoning. If we are told a house is haunted, we will accept it, now bother us not with this futile plot any longer and bring on the scary stuff! In my opinion, if they really wanted to do a really good job of remaking this, they could have woven in a bit more ambiguity into the plot. Included some of the aftermath of the Lutz family fleeing, such as the media interest and the whole 'real' or 'hoax' argument that followed.Anyway, to conclude, not an entirely bad movie, but on the other hand not an entirely good one. This is the typical, no-brainer, horror-by-numbers, frieze-dried movie that we have come to expect from the big studios these days. 4 out of 10. Stay at home and watch the Shining.",The Amityville Horror

241,flashbeagle,a well done remake in suit of Dawn of the Dead,7,18 April 2005,"Van Wilder's at it again, this time, he's in 1975 and trying to kill his family.Last year, a re-make horror movie came out and actually stood its own ground. It retold the story, but still was able to stay somewhat original. I'm talking of course about last years, ""Dawn of the Dead."" This year's horror movie remake is from 1979's Amityville Horror. Ironically, the original came out the year after the original Dawn of the Dead, and now, the remakes are following in the same suit.On November 14, 1974, a chilling murder was committed in a house off the coast of Long Island. The 6 members of the Defeo family were murdered in their sleep, only one member of the family survived, Ronald Defeo. Ronald Defeo later confessed to killing his family, claiming that demon voices commanded him to do so. This is the true story that ""The Amityville Horror"" is based on.The movie then picks up a year after these murders with George and Kathy Lutz looking for a house to move their new family of 3 children into. They come across a house in Amityville off the coast of Long Island that's being sold for close to nothing. The house is meant to be their dream house, but this dream quickly turns into a nightmare, as strange things begin to happen to the family every morning at 3:15.Ryan Reynolds, most known for his role as Van Wilder, takes on the role of George Lutz, a man determined to give his new family the dream life the deserve. I've always been a fan of Ryan Reynolds, dating back to his 2 guys, a girl, and a pizza place days, and I'm happy to say that Reynolds turns in a pretty acceptable performance. He is completely believable as the George. One might fear that his Van Wilder persona, might distract the audience from enjoying the film, however, Reynolds is able to make the character his own original creation. And yes he does get away with some very funny lines; with incredibly delivery of his lines. Alias's Melissa George plays Kathy Lutz, and also does a fine job with the character. The children in the movie serve their function quite nicely. They are scared out of their minds, and yes they are also creepy as hell.One of the things that make Amityville succeed with its horror is the movie's truth value. The Defeo family was a real family, living in the real house. The Lutzes were a real family that moved into the Defeo house and only lasted 28 days there. The film packs in plenty of jumps that will make you laugh right afterwards at the fact that you got scared. The best thing about it is that it doesn't rely on CG at all. There is one instance in which they used CG for a flood of bees. Other than that, the horror of the film is based off good old-fashioned cinematography and mood of the film itself.I'll admit that at moments, the film left me wanting more. Especially at the end, it didn't quite do it for me. While it doesn't stand on its own as much as last years Dawn of the Dead did, The Amityville Horror is still able to hold its own and becomes the 2nd horror re-make in a row to succeed. Amityville gets 4 stars (out of 5).",The Amityville Horror
242,cherootvendors,Enjoyable and sometimes scary blood and thunder remake,5,16 April 2005,"For the first hour this promises to be a superb remake of the creepy original, with plenty of sudden scares, spooky noises, etc. I must admit, I really liked the original, although today it comes across as a fairly cheesy haunted house movie. The remake, however, armed with a bigger budget and more technical prowess, will have most viewers jumping in their seats. However, despite technically well-executed scares, the original still tops it in terms of atmosphere and, well, realism (I never thought I'd call The Amityville Horror realistic...). Here in the remake, a promising ghost story soon becomes an over-the-top Hollywood horror movie, and strains credibility to the eleventh degree. (At one point I wondered if I was watching a remake of The Shining.) At any rate, despite going way over the top, for the most part this is a scary, atmospheric ride that is certainly worth the bucks/pounds/euros, etc. Overall, I'd say a 6/10.

Hide & Seek, the Sixth Sense, Poltergeist, the Exorcist all came into my mind at different points. *Spoiler City* There were some scares, with some very spooky ghouls running around or appearing and the treatment of the girl ghost twice made me jump, once at the very end, the image was just terrifying of being pulled into the floor whether you're a ghost or not. It was bit gory and it didn't all work, the doubting Thomas moment where the babysitter's finger goes into a bullet hole, the dog copping it, the torture chamber scenes. What got me the most was the stupidity/tolerance of the wife, watching her husband crack, brandish an axe, move out of the marital bed - who puts up with that???

251,user-11512,in the age of classic horror Hollywood remakes this film delivers,9,17 November 2006,"In the age where creativity is a thing remanufacutred or remade from 40 years or less, this film breathes sheer terror into its final product. I was an enormous fan of the original The Amityille Horror for two major reasons. One, this a very scary film, a young couple trying to create a nice family life together in a new home only to be terrorized by spirits of the past within the house, spirits that possess and almost tear the family apart literally. Second and this reason fully supports the first reason is that this really happened!!! Although its not quite as Hollywood as the film projects. I personally have visited the site of this American tragedy in Amityville, Long Island, New York, during our visit we visited a private beach on the same lake the protagonists sailed away on in the end, we saw the house, although remodeled to eliminate ""the eyes of the home"", also the neighborhood was much closer and normal looking than the film made out to be, there was no seclusion out in the woods, it was in fact a very normal suburban looking neighborhood. We even asked around the town and they all knew exactly which house it was and where it was, very nice people. Back to the movie. The 2005 version of this film combined Ryan Reynolds intimidating and calculated acting role as the stepfather being affected most by the house's evil was perfect to distill fear into his own family and the audience. The creepy aura and constant feeling of something just not quite right brings the film even moreso together. Now I acknowledge this is just a modern remake, but this movie featured very disturbing images and its own twist on the tragedy in Amityville. I fully recommend this, however, I think not only homage and respect should be paid to the masterful original, but that it should be viewed first, afterall it is the original, and making a judgment on the remake would be very unfair unless you had all the information to make that decision. In common interest with the modern remake issue are the following films that provide horrifyingly well done remakes: The Hills Have Eyes (2006), The Omen (2006), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003),King Kong (2005). And remember The Amityville Horror really did happen.....",The Amityville Horror

I am not a teenager who likes movies spoon fed to me. I hate bad acting and unnatural dialog. I love the horror genre. I love movies that I can identify with. I love movies that linger with me long after I am finished watching them.That said, this movie scared the **** out of me. Aside from some cheesy illogical decisions made by the characters in the film, I just let my self be taken in by the pure terror of the film. If you say to yourself, ""I would have left along time ago!"" or ""I would have gone the other way!"" while watching the movie then you will not like it. Just enjoy it for what it is; a scary movie.Brian Reynolds has slowly won me over since his days on Two Guys a Girl, and a Pizza Place (the worst sitcom ever). His transformation is pretty well done. I like the bloodshot eyes especially. The sex scene got me involved at looking for exposed parts of her body (I am a guy after all) and then BAM they throw in the image that Brian Reynolds' character sees across the room. I almost spilled my drink and the couple next to us started to laugh at themselves and at me and my wife because we all jumped! The babysitter scenes in the movie seemed to be added in to extend the movie but I enjoyed it. Her trapped in the closet had me clenching the arm rests until my knuckles went white.Sure, there were ""ideas"" ripped off from other horror films but that's why they were ripped off...because they work. I know (or think I do) when I am about to get spooked and am yet amazed at how some directors can still time it just right to catch me off guard for just a half a second longer to get me.I saw the original a few years after it's original release and was not that impressed. Margot Kidder is always gonna be Superman's love interest and I can't get past that.Bottom line is to just go and enjoy it. Don't try too hard to break it down. I thought it was going to be hard to top The Grudge but this one did it! The only reason this movie did not get a 10 was because of the slight drag at the end of the film. Escape already! The only 10 out there is Donnie Darko (in my opinion).Oh...and for The unemployed critic's comments. There is a reason you are unemployed, get over yourself. People, don't listen to that over-bloated head job!",The Amityville Horror
253,andriy-tanatar,Awfully boring,2,25 January 2006,"The Amityville Horror is based on a novel based on real events; however, both the novel and events are pretty old and can be described as belonging to ""pre-Stephen King era"". I cannot quite realize what made the producers revitalize the idea; however, this necrophiliac act produced an awfully boring movie.Skipping the main phases, the plot is so short, so predictable and so unoriginal (by modern standards), the actors are so unmemorable and the suspense is lacking to the extent that this movie literally belongs to good 'ol VHS horrors shot on a budget of at most 100 grand. Literally, I doubt this movie would lose anything would it be shot under those conditions. It might even benefit from more imaginative special effects, since the one used are really reminiscent of what was used again and again since the times of ""The Ring"", minus originality and suspense. Do yourself a favour and support independent studios at once: buy some trash by ""Trauma"" instead. It will likely have better acting, better plot, better director and more suspense.",The Amityville Horror
254,KEELING1985,Horror at its best,8,27 April 2005,"Well, I haven't seen the original so I cant compare but for Overall Horror, its the best I've seen in a while.I was uncomfortable from 15 minutes in. The House was horrible and evil looking from the outside and it gave such a great feel. The shadows and sound effects were great and the Girl on the Roof scene was amazing...I was tense, hot, worried and scared. Not screaming but the dark, glass shattering atmosphere was superb. I didn't jump but for a movie to make me feel so uncomfortable, its something I wont forget for a while.The Characters - Not one of them put a foot wrong. Star of the Show was Reynolds, I didn't think he could do it but I hated his character by the end of this Flick! He was horrible and the Character change throughout the Movie was incredible! Melissa George was surprisingly good too...8 out of 10 for me, the first hour was fantastic and fast paced, last 30 minutes weren't as good and it slowed down but still, it was good. I am glad it wasn't ""Toned down horror"". This is proper Adult material! See it!",The Amityville Horror
255,t-mieczkowski,boring and dead,4,24 September 2005,"I didn't finish the film it was so boring and dull. All creative juice is completely sapped from this tired, tired retread. Everyone looks like they are just cashing their paychecks. There wasn't anything glaringly bad about the movie except for the fact it feels totally lifeless and uninspired. I was somewhat surprised this was churned out by Michael Bay's production house -- this one isn't even close to the TCM remake from a couple years ago, and that wasn't exactly pretty. I'm a fairly big horror fan and this was just crap -- a typical Hollywood business film. 4/10 for moderate Hollywood slasher production values only -- recommended if you are a stupid teenager.",The Amityville Horror
256,rcmoorejr,"An improvement. over the original, but why bother?",6,26 November 2005,"The first AH was more faithful to the actual setting. The house, on Long Island, is a modest two story house on a small lot with neighbors close by, a typical suburban neighborhood. In the remake we have a setting out of The Shining, a three story rambling estate. In the original, which was not terribly frightening, the priest called in to bless the house was allegedly a close friend of the Lutz's, and he makes his entrance during the house warming early on. In this remake, he's an old friend of the killer's family and a stranger to the Lutz family and only shows up near the end to give speed to their urge to flee. The 2005 remake borrows heavily from the genre, but in so doing makes a more frightening movie than the original. By letting the audience see more than the characters, it scares you more effectively than the original ever did. The production values appear to be better this time, and in total, this remake is scarier than the original. As for the plot... eh. They do a good job of remaining faithful to the original until the last part, where they try to pull in a tale of some colonial torturer - very lame. A colonial era house with a foundation of brick and cinder block? Fortunately the film maker only throws it in in the last ten minutes for those who crave something more compelling as modus operandi than the ghost of a serial killer. If you haven't seen the original, see this one instead. Then go see the house on Long Island and shake your head over how this sorry attempt to make money from a 'haunted house' got this far.",The Amityville Horror
257,allnitediner,Meh.,2,16 June 2020,"The Amityville Horror is such a great story but the actors they chose and the way they are styled is laughable. Personally, I like to see a horror where the characters are realistic and I'm not distracted by their insanely fit, half naked bodies which take me out of the story because no one but celebrities look like that. The babysitter is dresses like a hooker, for some reason...? She tries to seduce a little boy, for some reason...? Ryan Reynolds dashes around shirtless, shiny and ripped the wife looks like a supermodel. It can't be taken seriously and it's clear that they're trying to make up for a crappy movie by adding sex appeal. It's insulting to the audience and with the scary parts being weak on top of this, it's a giant fail.",The Amityville Horror
258,user-153,Has this movie survived The Simpsons? NO!,1,3 August 2006,"Another one of those dreadful modern USA 'horror' films. The acting is diabolical, Reynolds being the worst offender, taking any conceivable opportunity to take his shirt off and flash his torso. As for his 'transformation', dark contact lenses simply aren't enough.The plot was always hackneyed, but this movie is indistinguishable from so many others of its genre, reliant on loud noises, surprise images and special effects of, yup, you guessed it, blood coming from the walls. You may recall a Simpsons Halloween episode where they encounter a haunted house and are told to 'get out'. That was, honestly, a scarier moment than when Philip Baker Hall's priest is told to 'get out'. Honestly. No, really.Pity poor Philip Baker Hall, it's a long, long fall from Hard Eight.If you're thinking of watching it, don't. If you've started watching it, stop after Rachel Nichols makes her exit.

259,chowdhmi,Truly horrifying....,1,14 June 2006,"....how a film this bad can be allowed distribution.Poor casting (eg the 'mother' looks about 20 but has already apparently given birth to three kids) means that I cannot take anyone seriously in this film.The shocks and scares are so well-telegraphed that even a deaf, dumb and blind person would know they were coming.This film is a mishmash of bog-standard haunted-house clichés (creaks, doors opening and closing by themselves, ghostly voices) and relies heavily on stacatto editing and fast-cuts to bring a sense of urgency to the story. It feels rushed and raw and that storyline is barely coherent amongst the mess.Effects are OK, but then, nowadays most are, so no points gained there.The film claims to be based on a true story, but having read the original book by Jay Anson, I can confirm that only the names of the characters and a solitary event with a priest bear any resemblance to the book. The actual story behind the Lutzes disappearance from the property has been finally shown to be pure invention and fiction too so what we have is a shoddy film that is based on lies.Don't blame me if you waste your time watching this after I've sacrificed mine to bring you this review.",The Amityville Horror
260,nickmat-2,A terrible film,2,23 February 2008,"A thoroughly disappointing film the plot is extremely shallow and the characters themselves are cartoonish without any real depth. It is just a B rate movie with little substance.*********************SPOILERS FOLLOW*********************************** There was only some suspense and tension as to what would happen to the new family staying there, would the father get overcome by the power of evil residing in the house and kill his family as the previous one did? Would he succeed in doing so? Whatever the case at the end of the day it was a dull, uninspired film that was randomly thrown together perhaps OK for teenagers but not for older more mature people with better judgement.My verdict is don't bother with this film find something better to watch though Hollywood seems to be going through a crisis and good films are ever harder to come by from there.",The Amityville Horror
261,NiteAnjel,Disaffected and disappointed,4,12 May 2005,"I went into this movie with an open mind. I love the original and thought that maybe the new Hollywood can capture what might have been lost back in 1979. And how I was crushed when I found out I had been let down hard.The whole pace of the movie is very off-beat. Hard to follow in some places and others drags too much. This time around they seem to rely on the ""jump out and scare you"" routine. Every so often there's an image or some blood. OK, I did like the finger thing. That kind of freaked me out. But in this day and age of movies, it's been way overdone. Scale it back to bare essentials and you've got something. I think what made the original so creepy is what they DIDN'T show you. They left it in your head and that's what kept you up later that night at home...3 weeks later. But in this one, they leave nothing to the imagination going all out on the gore and violence.As for the participation by the actors...well...OK. I like Reynolds, but he cannot hold a candle to Brolin. Just something about James Brolin made that movie. Reynolds looked as if he was trying to channel his predecessor instead of making the role his own. It felt very forced. All in all, if you want to scare your girlfriend, by all means see it. But if you want true cinematic horror, see the original and be done with it.",The Amityville Horror
262,lgran81,Ryan Reynold's bod sure saved this flick,5,12 October 2005,"Don't have high expectations for the 2005 remake of The Amityville Horror directed by Andrew Douglas and you just might enjoy it. If you have already seen the 1979 classic, it may already be too late for you.The nightmare begins when the Lutz family decides to purchase a gorgeous new home with a price that is too good to be true. They are informed by the Realtor of tragedy that occurred in the home, but decide to go through with purchase anyway  big mistake.Soon after moving in, strange occurrences begin to take place. Chelsea Lutz (Chloe Moretz) befriends the ghost of Jodie Defeo (Isabel Conner) while her step dad George Lutz, played by the very sexy Ryan Reynolds, begins to go a little nutty. All the while the family slowly begins to unravel and fall apart as the spirits of the previous tenants haunt and possess the current occupants.Throughout the movie there are a few scary scenes and creepy moments, but for the most part the remake of the 1979 classic is just silly. The most ridiculous scene would have to be with the scantily-clad babysitter, Lisa (Rachel Nichols). Lisa who appears to be 17 or 18 years old asks Billy Lutz (Jesse James) who appears to be no older than 12-years-old ""if he's ever Frenched before you know like French kissed"" during a bedroom scene. I mean come on  was this part really even necessary? However, the one great aspect of the movie  listen up ladies  is the numerous scenes with Ryan Reynolds half naked. In fact, according to the Internet Movie Database Web site, females gave The Amityville Horror a higher rating then men  gee, I wonder why.Despite the ridiculousness of the movie, it is still worth watching  especially so close to Halloween.Overall The Amityville Horror receives two and one half out of four stars. I would have given it only two stars, but Ryan Reynolds really does have a great body.",The Amityville Horror
263,khangfuzhun,Wasn't bad at all,7,11 May 2005,"Okay, let's all admit it, unless you're a die-hardcore fan of horror movies, then you probably get what I mean when I say that there were so many crappy horror movies, ESPECIALLY remakes, that failed to deliver. With all these stupid computer-generated effects, it was so hard to come by a horror movie that actually came out right.Fortunately, THIS remake came out. I admit, I was the person who almost completely disregarded that this came out, because the word ""Amityville"" was slapped onto the trailer. I became the skeptic who almost criticized it for being yet another dirty remake. However, I promised I wouldn't be like that when it comes to movies especially, so I decided to follow a buddy's advice and go see it myself.Guess what? It wasn't bad. Not at all. There were no crappily done special effects. There were really no unnecessary scenes, especially the scare scenes. In fact, all the scare scenes were effectively done right! Yes, done right. I felt that I hadn't wasted my money at all, because the new scare scenes were truly worth it. Ryan did a good job. And here I was not taking him seriously but as Van Wilder and crappy Blade sidekick. No, in fact, he did a really good job. Don't feel like going' in to the scenes, but I can honestly say that I was quite startled throughout the entire movie. It's the rare kind of movie that leaves you with a nightmarish impression afterward; when you arrive home and the lights are out, that's when the amityville impression kicks in.If you're expecting not a mediocre or crappy B-like horror movie, this one's got it.

After 4 nice black-dressed men and women searched me and my bag for cameras I could enter. Hopes were high to see a spectacular preview....but it was yet another scary movie of which we've seen so many lately. The movie begins with a ""based on a true story"" which holds true for about 3 or 4 minutes of the film. The scare effects were nicely done and not for the faint at heart. Unfortunately the film has almost only scare effects and no subtle-horror or suspense which is, if done good, much more effective. As usually you will again see a girl with black hair as a ghost (as in the ring 1-3 and ju-on: the grudge) which seems to be the stylistic masterpiece of every horror movie at the moment. Acting was nicely performed although scripted lacked some reality checking....this may be some sort of peculiar historical (1974 if I recall correctly) event in the U.S. so it could be that people there have a stronger relationship to this movie. I however didn't and was rather bored.",The Amityville Horror
266,theboywhocouldfly,too bad,7,17 April 2005,"Alas, another remake gone so horribly wrong. If only they'd taken the time to go back to what made the original novel frightening instead of the bloody effects shots slammed into frames in order to try to elicit some scares. Subtlety is unfortunately not on display at all in this guided tour of some of the events from the book. If only they'd attempted eeriness instead of heavy handed horror. The first rooftop scene in the film is actually quite well done and perhaps the best scene in the film. other than that, a bathroom scene with the youngest son manages to deliver some suspense, but otherwise this movie is a ""don't bother"" in my book. The actress who plays the wife is excellent, making me believe she actual cared for her children and delivering the only worthwhile performance in the film. She deserves better. And Ryan Reynolds seems to have watched jack Michelson in ""The Shining"" way too much. I know this review is not particularly well written, but frankly, to spend much time on a film like this would be pointless. Final words: ""For God's Sake-STAY AWAY!!!""",The Amityville Horror
267,Error_PC_LOAD_LETTER,Bad remake of 'the shining' steals Amityville Horror's good name,4,26 March 2006,"I am giving this a 4 out of 10 only under the condition that it is seen for what it is, a movie in an of itself which in fact bares little resemblance to the true story from which it borrows the name. People who like the original story (the book, not the first movie) will be very disappointed.The main mistake, in my opinion, was the writers/producers trashed many good elements of the original horror story and substituted them with cheap scares and cliché' rip-offs from other well-known horror movies (The Shining, Darkness Falls, Dark Water, to name a few). The original story (book) was disturbing and creepy enough, and a true artist would be glad to capture this threatening atmosphere in a psychologically unsettling movie.It is necessary to discuss the book a little in order to explain why this movie falls short. In the original story, George and Kathy Lutz move into the infamous c.1925 Dutch Colonial house on Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island, and almost immediately experience tension and uneasiness that leads to domestic problems. Then there are some very unsettling supernatural occurrences, typical of the frightening hauntings and poltergeist activity we occasionally read about and lose sleep over. The demonic/ghostly/poltergeist activity increases, becomes more malevolent and nightmarish. The local priest is earnest but suffers extreme demonic thwarting of his own. The 5 year old girl has an imaginary friend, a talking pig named 'Jodie' who seems only mildly disturbing at first to the parents, but soon it becomes apparent that the child's imaginary friend is probably some kind of demonic entity, a dark, menacing presence with glowing red eyes. When the children become the main targets of the malevolent demonic activity, targeted to die,the family struggles to flee. The overall story has a growing, brooding nightmarish feeling while staying matter-of-fact in describing the bizarre occurrences.Now, let's talk about the movie. Here, instead of a believable 1925 Dutch Colonial house, we are given a Victorian seaside resort that looks like it was built in the 1890s and told it was the oldest house on Long Island, built in the 1600s as, out of all things, a Jesuit sanitarium where American Indians were confined and tortured to death. I'm already sickened by this un-authentic agglomeration. Instead of an imaginary talking (male) pig, the little girl's friend Jodie is a girl ghost who was murdered in the house previously (possibly a rip-off from 'Dark Water'). The imaginary playmate is not the threatening demon / pig /hooded boogeyman of the original story, but much more like little Danny's imaginary friend 'Tony' in the Shining -- Jody instead sorta becomes a good 'spirit guide' that helps the child escape axe-wielding dad.The house seems to show grizzly scenes from its overly-sordid past as a direct rip-off of the resort hotel does in ""the shining.' Even George Lutz, who in the original book strove desperately to save his family from an enemy he couldn't fight or even see, is instead transformed (in this movie)into an axe-wielding ""here's Johnny"" maniacal killer rip-off from The Shining. I don't know, but I'm not scared of a man threatening me with an axe (ever hear of a deranged person? that's all it is). Rather, I'm scared of menacing demonic entities I cannot even see or fight threatening my loved ones. The only 'monster' in this movie was George Lutz.This movie made the usual mistakes of other bad horror movies (Boogeyman, the Tooth Fairy (darkness falls), etc) of using sudden, loud thrashes of sound and light (over 400 times) in order to startle people since it has very little power to truly scare anyone.Also, the idea of Jesuit priests torturing American Indians in a hospital so that they become demonic entities simply is not credible. In truth, the Shincock Indians believed the area was swarming with demons, and that's good enough. No need to bring in the torture asylum. John Ketchum, portrayed in this movie as a 1600s Jesuit priest, was in fact a semi-famous colonial-era practitioner of demonic arts and was eventually charged with witchcraft -- far more scary than a (supposed) religious hypocrite.It is my hope that someday, someone will produce an Amityville Horror movie that sticks to the original unsettling story, rather than try to cram every horror cliché into one cheap-scare B-minus piece of crap.Don't waste your time/money on this movie. Read the book instead, and it will scare the hell out of you.",The Amityville Horror
268,spire65,"Better for some, not for others",9,28 April 2005,"I will admit upfront that I did enjoy this more than the original, which I did watch BEFORE seeing this. The story is fairly similar to the original yet still different enough for fans of the original to be entertained. The biggest difference I find between the two versions is how they try to scare you. The original takes a more dramatic, psychological approach. For some, this is far more enjoyable, and unfortunately, I believe a lot of critics only value this type of horror while overlooking other aspects of the genre. This new version still retains a bit of the psychological aspect but utilizes a lot more shock value than its predecessor. When it comes down to it, shock value is the sure bet. Many people get ""immune"" to the normal scare tactics, but for example, something loud and screechy jumping out at someone when it's least expected -- that can make even the most stalwart of horror fans jump. I feel this remake contains enough shock value in combination with an adequate amount of psychology, which was prevalent in the original, to warrant the score I gave it. However, like the title of my post indicates, some people will still want the subtleties, drama, and psychology of the original. Both versions of the story are equally good and the acting, in my opinion, is comparable. Pick your poison.",The Amityville Horror
269,StuffedMannequin,Great ideas-- not so well executed...,4,15 April 2005,"I just got back from seeing this film. I have been waiting for it to come out for a few months and I was very excited to see it. So excited I checked out the reviews at rottentomatoes, at first it started off at 100%, to 75%, to 62%, to 45%, then finally dropping down to 27%. This didn't kill my anticipation, and neither did the 5.9 rating on IMDb. As i sat in the theater, I grew a nervous feeling, at first i thought i was afraid to see the movie, but later realized I was nervous about weather or not i was going to like it or not. Turns out, I was disappointed. But not so bad it turned into hate against the movie. It was like one big water slide. Up up up up, in the beginning, then went down toward the middle coming down to a soft thud as it hit the ground. The film starts off with Ronald Defeo Jr., loading his gun, walking around, and killing each and every one of his family members--A great start. The film has development for its characters. The beginning is George Lutz still adjusting to his new family he got together with, after marrying his divorcée wife Kathy, whom has three children. After that, they go house hunting, find the Amityville House, and buy it. Great pacing in that part, after that, it all seems so rushed. This is not expected from Scott Kosar, at least from me. The film jumps through days, 1, 15, and 28, the film is simply too short, the scares are too close together, and all and all the story is just too cramped up together. There were parents there that thought it would be a good idea to bring their (literaly) 1 year old babies to this movie, throughout it they were crying and everyone in the audience were yelling at the parents to take them out. Also the film is filled with comical moments that really kind of ruined the dark mood, (I.E. The babysitter and Billy), and Ryan Renolds does a sub par job at times. Steve Jabloski (SP?) Once again delivers an awesome score, but he didn't seem appropriate for this kind of film, some scenes seemed silly with it in. Although there are some really disturbing images in the movie, there are simply not enough to satisfy. Its the kind of movie id buy on DVD to watch a few times when i was bored or check out the features. I liked the movie, but i was disappointed with the shocks, scares, disturbing images, and most of all the bad pacing.7/10",The Amityville Horror

I'm not going to sit here and throw around the directors name like I know him, and who cares about the actors' previous work. Take the movie for what it is, forget it's a remake, it's a damn scary movie. Most of the ""scary movie"" conventions I've grown used to, this movie uses against you. For example, you've seen the old predictable bathroom scene (this example isn't actually in the movie) ""Someone's in the tub, someone's in the tub"" but unlike the convention, when the shower curtain is drawn, HA! fooled ya, there's no one there. But it uses that slight bit of tension it's built and directs it to the demon that's hangin' out outside the door that you didn't know was there (Somewhat like the ""Raptor Speech"" in Jurassic Park). Conventional ghosts at least wait until you're done having sex before saying ""hi"". I've never screamed in a movie theater until this movie. All I have to say is babysitter in the closet scene.

This usually doesn't bother me when I'm watching a movie, but their annoying/planned screams after each cheap shot did.The movie uses a lot of quick flashes and sharp noises to try to get a jump out of its audience. However, not once did I cringe because each 'scare' was set-up w/ a short calm silence... Come on, we all know somethings gonna happen.But nothing ever really does happen. In fact, it's very similar to the Ring in a way (most overrated horror flick ever) except no one dies.A movie with so many cheap shots should've at least been corny... then at least it would've been funnier to watch.

You wont need it here. Thank you MTV for inspiring new filmmakers to screw up Horror. If your under the age of 25 or so, you might love this movie.

274,darkwave2000,A Desperately Needed Remake,8,14 November 2005,"FINALLY they remade an old genre movie that really needed it! The original ""true"" story has just about been debunked as a hoax, but its a great story. A house built on an old Indian burial ground is the scene of a horrific slaughter of a family by one of it's own. Years later another family buys the house at an incredible discount and the sh't hits the fan. The 1979 version had Margot(Lois Lane)Kidder and James(Mr. Barbara Streisand)Brolin looking like the lead singer of Boston. It's amazing how unscary the original was given the great germ of an idea. The ""Get Out!!!!"" voice was better, though. If you've seen the real George Lutz, you know there's no way he was as buff as Ryan Reynolds. And the real Kathy Lutz is no Melissa George.....Rrrrrrrow! So I'm sure they're happy being portrayed by such good looking people even though they're probably poised to sue someone over something(again). I swear Jodi was supposedly a pig in the original story because the little girl only saw it's glowing eyes and heard it's squealing. That, for me, was scarier then anything else in the story. Here, they make her into the ghost of a slain little girl. And the infamous ""Red Room"" has been transformed into a sprawling torture chamber instead of a 3x3 room painted with blood and a hippy chick screaming about it being the ""Gateway To Hell!!!!!!"" This is a good, scary movie with some nice tweaks to the old story. The influence of the house on Reynold's character was beautifully creepy as it turned him into the abusive stepfather from Hell. The wood chopping scene was hard to watch. I recommend this movie for a good scare. If you are looking for Citizen Kane, go watch Citizen Kane.",The Amityville Horror
275,noam-reisner,Lost potential in what is a waste of a good story,4,6 February 2006,"Oh no... It's one of those 'based on the true story' films AND a remake! So in this case, it's a ""true"" story based on someone else's script, which was based on a book, which was based on what two people -George and Kathy Lutz - claim is a true story (disporved as a hoax). Well, anyone familiar either with the book or with George Lutz' account of the supposed haunting at the Amityville house can tell that the film stretches even the fabricated ""truth"", to put it mildly. Not that there is anything wrong with dramatic or creative license, but in this case none was needed. Mr. Lutz' original account of what transpired during those spooky 28 days in the old house where DeFoe Jr. murdered his entire family is creepy enough without embellishments. The problem is that Mr.Andrew Douglas - the remake's hapless director - took the Amityville story and the original equally bad film as an excuse to aflcit us with yet another clichéd tribute movie to various horror classics. Instead of adapting and remaking the Amityville story in a subtle and original way which would have driven home the spooky reality of its ""real-life"" resonance, Mr. Douglas bores the audience with one 'movie' reference after another - from blatant homage scenes to ""The Shining"" and ""The Exorcist"" to more annoying and less obvious tributes to ""Poltergeist"", ""The Ring"" and others. The result is a messy, predictable, yet-another imitation horror movie that goes nowhere. To be fair, some sections of the film work OK here and there. Ryan Reynolds who stank to high heaven in the stinker ""Blade 3"" delivers a good performance for what it's worth, and some of the horror set pieces are well paced and effective in themselves. But the overall result is disappointing, and it is a shame that such good material was allowed yet again to go to waste in such a way.",The Amityville Horror
276,nfxstudios,Untruths about untrue events?,3,17 April 2005,"In Kindergarten we played a game where the teacher whispered a secret to the first student, who then whispered it to the next, and so forth down the line of 15 or so kids. The last student to hear the secret would then speak it out loud, and the lesson was how much difference there was between what the 15th student heard and what the teacher originally said.Say what you will about the Lutz family's story, and Jay Anson's novel based on their story. I'm not up for the age old argument over hoax or truth, but at the very least even skeptics would have to admit that the Lutz family's story as told by Anson at least was not so completely preposterous as to be discarded out of hand.The James Brolin/Margot Kidder version of the story deviated from Anson's version of the Lutz story, but at least remained faithful to the material enough to resemble what George and Kathy related as fact.Now comes this disaster, 4th hand at best, worse if you count revisions to the original script written for the project. It's been a long time since I've read Anson's book, but I recall a tense, creepy, dreadful story which, if one were inclined to believe in the supernatural or at least approached with an open mind, came across as entirely plausible. This movie is such a departure from the original story it's no wonder George Lutz dismissed it entirely in a recent interview.On some levels it works on it's own merit. Camera-work and acting are at times effective, and certain scenes evoke a sense of urgency if not fear or suspense, but the rest is completely preposterous for a work alleged to be based on a true story. Far too many weak horror clichés riddle the story... going up and up and up the house from the ground floor to the roof (yes, the roof)to escape a shotgun-wielding maniac being the biggest offense. Worse though is the total disregard for the ""true"" story the movie is based on. The changing of facts for no apparent plot reason, moving of the time line for reasons that aren't even convenient to the plot. As a journalistic endeavor, the writer would likely lose his job and be blacklisted. As a form of entertainment, he'll probably get another job once the box office totals are in.Like I've hinted at earlier on, I neither believe nor disbelieve the original Lutz story because the fact is, no one but George and the kids know the complete truth. Those who support it as a true story contradict each other, as do those convinced it was all a hoax. But to produce an account of an allegedly true event, only to remove all traces of plausibility in the name of grinding together a slurry of traditional post-Ring horror clichés, is not only a sell-out, but a complete disaster.",The Amityville Horror
277,dfmapalo4,Amityville Horror (Best Remake Yet!),10,18 June 2007,"You suck if you thought this movie sucked! Michael Bay is the best producer. The actors were awesome...The movie wouldn't have been the best with out you...You guys rock!!!Summary: In November, 1974 twenty-year-old Ronnie DeFeo shot his entire family in 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville. One year later, the Lutz family moves in, Kathy, George, Billy, Michael, Chelsea and their dog, Harry. What was their dream home became their nightmare. The family suffers twenty-eight days of terror re-living what happened to the DeFeos. They have terrible visions of the Anti-Christ, tortured Indians who died on their property and the ghost of Jodie DeFeo. Will the family survive or will they die just like the Defeos did? Rent this exciting movie on DVD based on the true story. The Topic of the Movie:This incredible movie was memorable, interesting and entertaining. The Amityville Horror was memorable because, the movie was based on the true story. Of course the producer and director changed the setting up a little bit to make the subject scarier which is why the movie was memorable. When Jodie hurts the babysitter, Lisa the part is memorable because the scene is unusual and unrealistic. Also the scene where George chases his family through the house and out the front door it is memorable and keeps you on the edge of your seat because you don't know when George is going to jump out at you. Another thing that was memorable was the time George woke up every night while he was in that house, 3:15am. Now waking up at 3:15am is ironic for me. The film was interesting and entertaining because of how many random scares that you're going to get when you watch it. Usually the scares come when you least expect it that makes the movie fun and enjoyable. The Creator's Opinions: This movie is a remake of the 1970's original. The producer, Michael Bay thought that the remake was more successful than the original. I agree. Since they remade the movie in 2005, the special effects are improved, the acting and make up is better and the way they put together all of the scary scenes that made the movie awesome! Some of the other crew members commented on Chloe Grace Moretz who was about seven when they shot the film did an incredible job. Especially when she had to shoot the scene when she was on the roof. The roof to the house on the set was narrow. If you tried to get down safely with out being strapped to something, you'd probably get seriously hurt of you'd die. Chloe was strapped on safely to something but still she was very scared to walk across the roof. But the shooting of the scene was successful and I agree that Chloe did a wonderful job. Melissa George commented that Isabel Conner did just as well as Chloe. For Isabel being six years old in her first movie playing the dead girl, Jodie DeFeo she was awesome! All of her lines and facial expressions were well thought out!Issues The Subject Raises: In Amityville, there are a lot of issues including paranormal. Kathy Lutz's dream was to live peacefully in this beautiful Dutch Colonial home and to have a happy family until death. The main issue is that the spirits and the house itself are trying to possess George and make the family re-live the DeFeo's terrifying life Aside from George, Chelsea makes friends with Jodie. Little does Chelsea know that Jodie is dead and is trying to convince Chelsea to kill herself so that they can play together forever and ever? The possibilities for the actual situation would be for Kathy and George to not even buy the house at all because they knew that there were murders in the house in the first place. But then again, there wouldn't be a story. Personal Issues: The piece did affect me. This movie was my second horror movie. So I didn't know what to expect. In the very beginning when Ronnie shot Jodie, it made me sad. Because the little girl was only five and she was trying to tell her brother that she loved him and she didn't want him to hurt her, but he did it anyway. Jodie was innocent but the devil possessed her and made her do terrible things. But still, my opinions about the topic haven't changed. Conclusion: The Amityville Horror remake is my favorite movie of all time. I never get tired of watching it over and over again. The movie got me more interested in scary movies. Now, I'm not afraid to watch anything. Besides, I liked everything the cast and crew members created; I love the storyline and the special effects of course! Thanks to the cast and crew, this movie wouldn't have been the best without you. You may find the topic scary, but after the first five minutes, you really get into watching the film. If you are a drama or horror seeker (even if you don't sound interested give this movie a chance!) The Amityville Horror is the perfect movie for you!!!",The Amityville Horror
278,poohbearski,One of the WORST films ever made,1,6 June 2009,"Not only one of the worst remakes but one of the worst FILMS ever - hands down. Why you ask?First off, the screenwriter said he would be more faithful to the novel than the first one. Guess he didn't say WHICH novel. Cuz it sure as hell wasn't The Amityville Horror by Jay Anson. The film was mindless, unscary dreck. Garbage. That's what it was.Let's look at the crap that was 'added':To change the ending and have them escape by boat? Changing Jody from a PIG to a little girl? to change the young babysitter to a lecherous perverted teen? to having George kill the family dog? to having George build coffins? to have the house haunted by some guy who made coffins?These are only some of the plot points that the screenwriter got from the book. But what book? Like I said, it wasn't Amityville.The film just plods along, does nothing, and has the characters act like jackasses. This film is soooooooooooooo bad. I was soooooooo angry after seeing it that I wanted my $$$ back. Anyone who liked this film - please go back and watch the original or better yet - read the novel. Far superior to this piece of s*%$.",The Amityville Horror
279,THEMILTONS1,very scary,9,23 April 2005,"While entering the theater for The Amityville Horror, I was expecting to see just another mildly scary thriller. But this movie delivers the great terror that only ""The House On Haunted Hill"" has done for me before. This movie makes The House On Haunted Hill look like Winnieh The Pooh. the scenes are terrifying to the extent that people in the theater were screaming and running away. Although I thought about doing so at some of the most terrifying moments, i sat and watched anyway. And I am glad I did, for the climax is so intense, that i could not turn my head from the screen. This movie starts off good and just gets better and better. leading up to the Climax were the scariest scenes i have ever seen in a movie. this overtakes the original, and doubles the amount of scares. It was worth every penny. I hope all Horror Movie fans will see this work of terrifying art. But this movie is not perfect, do not get me wrong. there are some scenes where blood is overly used, and others where it is hard to understand what is happening. But these are minor annoyances in this great movie.",The Amityville Horror
280,cadeland2002,If This Don't Scare Ya Nothing Will,9,20 April 2005,"*SPOILERS AHEAD* I just saw this film tonight and STUPIDLY went and saw it by myself. I've lost count of how many horrors I've seen, but in my opinion this film was INCREDIBLY SCARY! Twenty minutes in I'd jolted so many times I was close to leaving the cinema, intending on watching it when it came out on video so I could pause it every now and then when the jolts got too much. The fifth jolt I can't even recall as I think I've blocked it from memory! Luckily the film settled down after that (for 10 minutes or so!!) and I bravely experienced the whole thing. Having done that, I honestly now count this in my top 5 scariest movies of all time (alongside The Exorcist, Ringu, Dark Water and Wrong Turn). There are a things in this film which are not so perfect which I'll get out of the way first. The plot is far removed from the original book and film, Ryan Reynolds clothes seem to unnecessarily keep falling off (which isn't a bad thing considering how buff he is but at the same time is just a little too hard an attempt at eye candy). To be honest both he and Melissa George are far too pretty for their parts and on that basis seem quite mis-cast. Melissa's acting, though she tries hard, just doesn't seem to convince, and of course the those CGI flies and cowardly priest...yes they're as bad as everyone is saying.However, with that out of the way, let's get onto the good parts, the scene in the cupboard with the babysitter, SCARED the hell out of me, I was, from a realism point of view, glad to see the babysitter a gibbering wreck, being carried away on a stretcher after the wardrobe scene, as anything less would have not been believable, in real life that experience = mental hospital quick smart! The first 20 minutes was so jarring I stopped eating my popcorn for fear of sucking back some and choking, even the shot of the shadow racing past the kitchen made me jump a mile high as by then my nerves had been rattled so much from one relentless scare after another.The scene on the roof with the daughter wanting to go 'be with daddy' again, was gripping, the shot of Kathy sliding helplessly down the roof holding onto her daughter was filmed superbly. The climax where they are trying to escape the house was brilliantly gripping and had me on the edge of my seat (although it was a little annoying the family running UPSTAIRS in the middle of this - why do they make people do that in films?) - however this did lead to an awesome chase across a rain soaked roof which was extremely tense. I found the scene where the priest tells Kathy of when her daughter's teddy bear was last scene spine tingling and the scene at the church when Kathy says ""I'm living in their house"" (or something to that effect) awesome with the chill element too.I did see the Kathy character as being annoyingly weak in her dealings with her children and especially her husband as he moved into psycho-ville, I mean after almost having had your head sucked into a boat motor by hubby on purpose I think you'd be a LOT more angry than she seemed to be! (I have to say at the same time though I found that scene incredibly frightening and effectively done). I would have however liked to see her bonk hubby on the head with a heavy blunt object after that instead of just shouting a line and running out of the boathouse (she does get to do some head-bonkage to hubby near the end though which led to a few women in the audience applauding which was amusing). Before I forget I have to say the dead girl is freaky and finishes off the film with one last great scare (which I pre-emptied by tensing up and sliding down in my seat but STILL jumped!) All I can say is if you are expecting it to stick too closely to the book don't bother, but if you're willing to just sit back and take in a brainless scare flick then go for it, I am SO getting this out on video when it comes out so I can watch my fave scenes again, I truly thought this was a brilliantly scary movie, it wasn't until about an hour after I'd left the cinema that I got my jangled nerves back together to be honest!",The Amityville Horror

BUt when the ghosts enter th story , there was efficiently able to keep the viewer in its horror's grip.

Even the terrace scene when that little girl is walking on the thin terrace was thrilling enough ! But the brave mom (Melissa) makes it all rite every time ! Ryan Rynold has a bit failed to emerge out some real actor, His acting has disappointed a bit, but Melissa was great in every scene she did. The character which Ryan played was a man who was not strong enough to fight for the family.They never come back to this ville to take back their possessions ! the homicide which has taken place there has made it a place for ghosts, but I wonder , why did they continue to live in that place even after getting to know that some strange things were going on in that house. She finds out that fact at the very last moment, and then the hunt starts against time, I really liked her battle against those evil powers.This movie is just like any other average horror movie, but a good time pass ! acting and character of Melissa is really appreciable.",The Amityville Horror

I am a lover of the original 1979 Amityville and think this remake is an outstanding update. I normally am not fond in the least of remakes and frankly am tired of seeing remakes of old movies constantly instead of some really fresh ideas coming from Hollywood.

283,evanmartin411,Amityville remake disappoints Amityville fans,2,19 March 2006,"November 1972, Amityville police department arrived at 112 Ocean Ave. (in the film 412 Ocean Ave.) around 3:15 a.m to a scene of a grizzly mass murder.

One year later the house was sold to the Lutz family of Deer Park, Long Island for a astounding price of $80,000. 28 days later the Lutz fled in terror leave all, but the clothes on their backs and never returning.In this ridiculous remake of the best selling book and popular cult 1979 film, it fails to live up to neither of them. All though Reynolds and George give amazing performances, the script lacks originality and meaning. Over done and unrealistic, this film doesn't even come close to even be consider renting or buying, but only to be seen once and forgotten. Director, Andrew Douglous, I might add worked well with what he was given and has proved to land a spot in future jobs in Tensil Town.

284,calebdrums,"Not All That Scary, But I've Seen Worse",5,30 June 2020,"The Amityville Horror is one of those films that I look at with a great big sense of indifference. It doesn't make me happy, it doesn't make me angry. It just kind of...exists within its own little world of ghosts, ghouls, demons, and Ryan Reynolds. It's not particularly scary (except for the very last scene), but it does its duty in a good way. It's no ""The Conjuring,"" but it's not ""Troll 2,"" either. It's just...there.The story is simple, regarding a family moving to a house in Amityville, New York and becoming terrorized by a demonic presence that has infested the home. This leads to the discovery of an ancient Indian torture chamber in the basement, and the slow possession of Reynolds's character. In the final moments, he attempts to slaughter his family with an axe, but they manage to stop him. They then flee on a boat and, presumably, live happily ever after. This...might be the only horror movie I've ever seen with a semi-happy ending. Nobody died...except the dog. That was the sad part of the film, and by sad, I mean extremely sad. Why? Because he's a dog, and dogs are awesome.Anyway, the film really doesn't offer anything shocking aside from the appearance of one or two ghosts, and they don't exactly scare the pants off the viewer. This is especially true in the case of Jodie DeFeo's apparition. She just looks bored, and her ""scariness"" comes off as being harmless, for the most part. She does stick the babysitter's finger through the bullet hole in her head, but that's more disgusting than frightening.But then...comes the final scene in the movie. As the Lutz family speeds away across the canal, we cut back inside the house and see Jodie standing at the bottom of the stairs. She begins screaming, and the editing creates the illusion that her head is jerking at a hundred miles per hour. While this is going on, the house goes through some not-so-subtle changes, and essentially resets everything in preparation for its next victim. Once this is complete, the camera slowly rolls back from Jodie until a pair of disembodied hands pull her through the floor to an unknown fate below. That...was the scariest part of this entire movie. It creates a third dimension of thought within the mind. Is Jodie's spirit being controlled by some malevolent entity? Those disembodied hands scream, ""yes!""All in all, the movie was decent, if unspectacular. I probably won't watch it again, but if you like Ryan Reynolds, axes, semi-scary ghosts, and a house that looks like its watching you, then I'd recommend it. If not, don't bother.",The Amityville Horror

The Lutz family don't care, they buy it anyway.Then all kinds of strange supernatural happenings start to drive them crazy like the expected ghost and all that. The ""spirits"" start to take over and possess the family and they go nuts.Ryan Reynolds makes it watchable because he's good, especially if you like hot men. Chloe Moretz gives a good performance too. Rachel Nichols and Jesse james have a goofy scene together, but besides that this movie is very creepy, much more than most horror films coming out today.One scene were the girl is on the roof of the house and almost falls had me on the edge of my seat.

288,BrianSingleton,someone please bring back real horror movies!,2,16 April 2005,"For starters, I'm not one of these guys who spends all day writing IMDb reviews, at least not for movies like this, and I'm sure my opinion is just as worthless as the next guy's, but if you want the thoughts of a real horror movie fan, please continue.If anyone thinks that the Amityville remake is a great horror movie, you're either you're not a horror fan at all, or you're so young you think horror movies began with The Ring (or for the slightly older crowd, the Scream trilogy). For those who know anything about good horror, or good film for that matter, you'll know better than to praise this worthless piece of recycled trash.Andrew Douglas's new Amityville is typical Hollywood-remake formula garbage: bigger, louder, faster, flashier, clichéd, contrived & pointless with no substance and plenty of predictable spoon-fed scares delivered by loud musical cues and strobelight effects. All of this is obvious in the first 10 seconds and it just gets worse from there. Despite the fact that this film makes countless unnecessary changes to the original story including the addition of a token ""little dead girl in a dress"" appearing in every mirror and window, the movie still has nothing new to offer anyone, even if you pretend it's not a remake and accept the movie on it's own.Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds does give a good performance as George Lutz and the children in the film are surprisingly realistic looking, sympathetic, and well played, unlike the typical parade of irritating child actors (""The Godsend"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Hide and Seek""). But, even good performances are still overshadowed by the trendy flash-editing techniques that plague every modern horror film these days. The overblown rapid-fire cuts, ridiculous excess of shots, and neverending CGI FX create another cookie-cutter haunted house movie like predecessors House on Haunted Hill, The Haunting, The Grudge, Boogeyman etc.One of the worst scenes in the film features the Lutz's creepy new babysitter posing suggestively on the bed of their barley teenage son, Adam, and asking him ""Do you French?"", then gets herself locked in a closet by the ""new"" Jody (little dead girl in a dress). The rest of the fun in this film comes from spotting all the great nostalgia of the decade in the children's bedroom's (the decade being the 1970's, although the movie does it's best to hide this fact because no good horror movie ever takes place in the 70's, right?). Among the throwback items are the original Operation game, Light Brite, and Kiss posters. Take it from someone who knows real horror (George Romero, John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Lucio Fulci, Sam Raimi etc), The Amityville remake is just as bad as all the other horror remakes. However, on a positive note, if you want an example of one recent horror remake that's truly outstanding, watch Glenn Morgan and James Wong's remake of Willard staring Crispin Glover, it's a masterpiece!",The Amityville Horror
289,farfromperfection,Scary?,3,27 October 2005,"I find it amusing that people are basing the rating of this movie as to how well it scares instead of a proper critique; for example one that actually portrays a film properly.I've not seen the original first of all. I went into watching this movie knowing very little about the factual basis behind the ""true"" story of the Lutz family but never the less, still came out feeling like I'd wasted 80 minutes of my life.As I collected more evidence on the case in question, I felt deprived that instead of focusing on the ACTUAL crime that happened at the house, they decided to concentrate on a false claim made by the Lutz family in the aftermath of the DeFeo killings. It has been widely stated that the Lutzes only sold the story about the supposed spirits in the house haunting them because they were in debt. I think the movie makers should have paid a little more attention to this before they tried to make a film out of something bogus and calling it ""true"".A film that paid more attention to the DeFeo family in particular the rumours about the family themselves would have made a far more compelling and interesting movie. True, it might have not been as scary or gory but at least it would have had some depth or intelligence to it to reconstruct what happened that night in 1974. Oh, I forget one crucial thing. People want to see this garbage. People find stupid, perpetual horror/humour of this kind amusing. Hence the ""rave"" reviews. I agree with whomever said the people rating this movie so high are probably those that are underage and have just sneaked out to their first ""scary"" movie like I did with Scream in 1996. Amityville Horror does nothing different from all the mock horrors out there at the moment; The Grudge etc and although yes, in places, it has a few ""wet your pants"" moment I would hardly base a film on that alone.It was a shame, as I enjoyed the actors in particular Melissa George.

294,bootmyhead@yahoo.com,The Un-happy marriage,3,8 May 2005,"It really is an unhappy marriage of an old story with the worst of modern Hollywood slop.Purists should know the 2005 AH departs from both the book and the original film significantly. These changes introduce clichéd and over-used climactic elements to achieve a cheap thrill without creativity or originality. While the original film thrilled viewers with an authentic-feeling, voyeuristic observation of one haunted family, the new version simply shocks with blood and gore, sudden shunts of otherwise unexplained noise and light, and a ""New for '05!"" sub-plot stolen (without the slightest deviation) from Jeepers Creepers. Copious elements of Kubric's version of ""The Shining"" were added to complement an otherwise aimless and brain-dead retelling of the original Amityville story.Throughout the film, I wondered if this was not, primarily, a retelling of one of my favorite horror flicks, but instead a diatribe on the horrors of a bad marriage. Symbolic elements, probably left subconsciously by a miserable production staff, hint at a psychotic hatred for marriage and family. This -was- scary, but not worth analyzing here.I really expect that anyone who has seen and enjoyed the original AH will be deeply disappointed, while the curious teenager might get a good jump and a squeeze from their date. Enjoy it if you can.",The Amityville Horror
295,nineinchnails17,Oh my god!,4,15 April 2005,"The only reason this got 4/10 star is because a few jolting moments. That is all. The original ""Amityville Horror"" wasn't a great movie but it was a ""fair"" movie rather...having more than a few genuinely creepy moments kept it somewhat entertaining. However...why are we remaking horror classics? Next thing we know F13 is going to be remade with Jason's mother actually being a homicidal transsexual driving around the woods in some old Jeep praying on hired help trying to reach the respective camp. I tell ya. Or a remake of Nightmare on Elm Street having Robin Williams in a controversial portrayal of Freddy, who turns out is actually the father of Nancy and conceived Nancy in a cheap hotel room while Nancy's ""real"" parents had separated over mutual alcoholism. If these sound plausible than you'll love the remake of Amityville Horror.",The Amityville Horror
296,Craven-11,"I had ""High Hopes""",4,19 April 2005,"Why can't they make a good horror film in Hollywood? The fact that The Amytiville Horror is now a blockbusting hit for the second time would suggest that the above claim is wrong. But money and quality don't exactly tally up.Because this film has a history that surpasses 'fiction' into supposed 'reality' - possibly its 'True Story' status, along with tales such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Blair Witch Project, both hits, is the reason for this. Some people are perhaps gullible enougth to believe that if the tag says 'True Story' than it is somehow more believable and more 'realistic'. The style of all of these films try and impose a sense of the real, whether through the use of video footage or pictures or newspaper clippings. They are all based on the belief that the supernatural exists, and this is what draws in the audience, fascinated and intrigued by these wild 'true life tales'. Just imagine the derision if The Blair Witch Project had been marketed without the idea that it was based on the documented footage of these kids who had gone into the woods chasing up a curse and NEVER - CAME - BACK. What if it premiered as a movie based on fiction, without the hype - I imagine that most people either wouldn't have bothered or would have thought they'd been cheated out of their money by 'amateur' filmmakers. Its reliance on 'fact' is the anchor for the film's success, as is Amytiville's.The original at least had its own identity - a creepy little score and some neat imagery of the house, rather simple, (not the sheer height of the house in the remake), with the peering-eye windows and the red glow over the house. It took its pace slowly but when things happened they had an impact - the priest being told to 'get out' - noises at night when the clock turned 3.15 - it had some room to breath. The remake is another example of shameless style over substance, over the top in its reliance on CGI at most times, the frequent and all too detailed ghosts in torment just seeming to 'shock for shocks sake' but getting nowhere. The characters are pretty but dull, and the children of the family just irritating. Ryan Reynolds does his best and at times nearly pulls it off, all red eyes, but the fact that he becomes 'possessed' almost straight away means that all suspense is lost.None of it seems plausible as it plays out, none of it adds up as it goes along, the script and film in general holds no water. The teaser trailer for the film provided me with high hopes in its 'economy of style' (take note) - the blank screen, shotgun blasting, and then the house and the omen-like score gave it a simplicity that could have worked wonders. But it simply went straight for the jugular and never gave any thought to pace or contrast or reflection or mis-direction - anyone who had seen the first film would have known what was about to happen and why. The interesting parts of this film were few and far between and even then adhered to cliché done better before (why do possessed children always want to go somewhere high and dangerous? (New Nightmare),and everything good about the original was thrown out for sudden shocks and scares. Even the poster looks good, but still it failed to hold me in any way - possibly because it was always about appearances and not about making a movie that questioned the audience in anyway, didn't take a fresh approach, a new look at the myth. It was another moneymaker, but what a wasted opportunity to make something memorable. Just another vacuous remake in the sea of vacuous remakes, all shells of their former selves.",The Amityville Horror
297,jordanmono,A lesson: Less is more,2,16 April 2005,"I just returned home from seeing this remake of the original. I had been looking forward to seeing how they would do the remake and I must say I'm terribly disappointed. Not that I was expecting something better than the original, but they certainly didn't think being subtle about it was the way to go. Less is more! They seemed to have about a billion corpses coming out of nowhere in nearly every scene, a cheesy babysitter character, animal cruelty, etc. Why did they need to kill the dog? Was that really necessary for us to realize that George Lutz is going crazy? I walked away feeling as if they'd jammed it down our throats this idea of a haunted house. They completely made this ""Hollywood"" and bloated it up much more than the original ever did. Back then they used subtlety and kept you moving along at a spooky pace until the climax. I would just prefer not to see Jodi's gross face and rather imagine it for myself. I mean, she is an imaginary friend...why should I know what she looks like? The original used a creaking chair to help you envision Jodi. And I thought Jodi was the pig?? I can understand why the real George Lutz is angry with the filmmakers. In the original, Brolin's Lutz doesn't go crazy to the point of actually putting an ax in front of the step-son's face. This remake makes Lutz out to be a maniac which is not the case at all in real life.The only really great part about the movie was how much I laughed with a lot of Reynolds' Lutz. When he began going crazy his attitude towards the family was quite HILARIOUS. I was cracking up in my seat.Just a tip for everyone too...find out the real truth for yourself. It's much more interesting once you read up on how the murder actually happened (the kid's sister was in on it too and they were on drugs...he was forced by his attorney to plead insanity, etc.) It's a good read.",The Amityville Horror
298,mike-arredondo,Mediocre Movie,5,22 October 2005,"Before I tell you a bit about the film, let me just tell you that the original version is my all time favorite horror/ suspense movie. I realize that movie had its short comings but I really enjoyed the screenplay in the first one. The actors did a superb job and told the story in a riveting way that to this day still captures the essence of what ""I"" feel is a good suspenseful horror film, leaving just enough to the imagination.As for the 2005 version, generally speaking the film had a couple of moments that in hindsight ""might"" have added to the original film's ""experience"" however, I was largely disappointed. There are several ways to tell a story and unfortunately, this script was somewhat dry, leaving the characters distant. I never really felt connected to any of the characters, nor did I build up the kind of concern for any of them that I had hoped. Unlike some people on the set during the filming, (who according to one of the Special Features commentaries were actually overcome with emotion during one of the exchanges between George and Billy) I struggled to be emotionally involved or charged during any of the action sequences. There were too few close ups, too many re-enactments (with deliberately different camera angles from the first, but not different enough) and worst of all, not enough real acting. The scenes were all very short and none of the characters ever really came to life, lacking candor and warmth.In a strange paradox, the main character George Lutz might have been the closest semblance to a martyr in the film. The story predominately focuses on him as he is incrementally lured into this state of predictable psychosis. I almost pitied him as he unwittingly unraveled, however he lack the ""falling apart"" at the seams conviction that the actor in the previous film had.The the other issue I had with his character, was that George's rage seemed to climax without much of a burst or supernatural flair. The chase scenes were a far cry from the original's edge-of-your-seat suspense, choosing instead to try (& fail) to capture the angst from ""The Shining"". Perhaps the film makers could have spent a few more dollars on touching up the contact lenses, added a few more sound effects and close ups.Bottom line, in the first film I must have told myself over a dozen times ""Get out of the house!"" as opposed to this new film where it crossed my mind once or twice... and with about half of the urgency of the first.Knowing the story line beforehand may have tainted my view somewhat, I'm fully aware of that and I wonder... if someone will come away with a different view if they were to watch the original after seeing this one?Ultimately, I found myself cutting this film too much slack in my book as I tried to enjoy it and using up that kind of mental energy to convince myself that I should care for these characters has a way of detracting from the movie.This movie was not horribly bad, just not anywhere as good as it could have been.",The Amityville Horror
299,RobZombie01930,A decent film,7,16 April 2005,"Well I went in to watch this film expecting the upsets I have received from a-many horror films, including ""White Noise"" ""Darkness"" and ""Boogey Man"" and I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised.This movie does great at what it does. It doesn't use the ghost concept as good as it could, which I was a little sad about, but it picked up in plenty of jump-scares and creepy moments. This movie starts off good, and gets better.Well, I don't have much to say about this film, aside that from all points of view, it was just a fun little horror flick. I give this a nice 7/10 because although not the best movie I've ever seen, it's a fun movie to watch for some good jumps and goosebumps.Overall this movie does what it tries to do, and gets you to jump numerous times. The plot is pretty interesting, and although I've never seen the original, I've been told it gives more information on what happened.Dimension pulled one off. Wow!",The Amityville Horror
300,unloco161,Kinda Crappy,5,4 May 2005,The only reason this flick got a 5 out of 10 out of me is that horror movies just flat out suck these days. There was probably one scene that made me twitch ever so slightly in this entire film. That was the part where random-zombie-guy-you-only-see-once-in-the-movie popped up in the bathroom behind the kid. There is no real reason to see this movie besides the hot babysitter scene (no nudity) and it MIGHT scare your date a little closer. I grew up relatively near Amityville and have seen that house. It doesn't look anything like that and it sure as hell isn't built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground. I mean come on people! You can do better than that. One last thing...whats with the Capatain Hook/Candyman looking guy? Weak. Hey at least it doesn't have Paris Hilton in it.,The Amityville Horror
301,pony_boy_roger,this movie shows that good ideas in Hollywood have become scarce,2,26 April 2005,"Ever since we hit the 2000 year mark it seems to me that most horror movies have exactly the same feel. I've seen most horror movies in the theater that were released since the 2000s and I now cannot differentiate one from the other. The Amittyville Horror was the very latest ""scary"" movie I've seen on the big screen and it makes me want to never see a horror film again. This movie (along with plenty of other 2000 horror flicks) makes me think that if I ever go to see a scary movie in the theater again it'll be just another terrible remake using the same tactics they've been using for the last five years. One of these tactics that I find quite notable is the fast-forward-twitch. Where a character in a horror film is fast-forwarded and blurred to seem as though they are twitching or moving insanely or maniacally. THIS EFFECT HAS BEEN USED IN EVERY SINGLE HORROR FILM I'VE SEEN FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS! When I saw that this effect occurs in Amittyville I decided that I'd had enough. Apart from that, there's nothing really interesting about the film in the first place. It's predictable, typical, unoriginal, and forgettable. I actually went to the lobby of the theater for 15 minutes during the movie and when I came back and asked my friend what I'd missed, she said exactly what I thought was going to happen. My point - don't waste your time on this film, not even to rent it. If you see a poster of it or an advertisement of any kind, just keep walking and save yourself the disappointment.",The Amityville Horror
302,xxblubaby22xx,Disappointed,3,17 April 2005,"Although the acting and plot line of this remake of the original were good, it lacked any true facts to the original Amityville Horror House and its story. The only aspect that was correct was the name of the families: Defeo and Lutz, and what happened to the Defeos. Unfortunately, I'm sure the producers and director thought that tweaking the story to make it more gory and stupid was a great idea. Other than my disappointment of them not sticking to the true story, it had its moments of fright and I, myself, jumped out of my seat. Other than that, the plot line (for a different story, that is) was good and kept your attention. A little confusing at times, but you might as well see it for a good scare.",The Amityville Horror
303,Hindinwood,Entertaining Yet Ultimately Unremarkable,6,3 May 2005,"It's unfortunate that every horror movie made in Hollywood right now has to be soooooo derivative. It started out promisingly enough, with an impressionistic depiction of the murders that took place in the house. This established an effective atmospheric tension which was supported by the excellent cast, as the next family moves into the house. The actors playing the three kids were particularly great, and neatly avoided that cheesy kid-in-a-horror movie acting. I have to admit I was pretty creeped out for the first hour, mainly just because I'm easily scared, and the mood was so dreary and oppressive.Of course the director did his best to blow it by resorting to tired genre clichés like creepy dead kids (think ""The Grudge""), bathroom/bathtub scenes, and that effect where the character's head moves back and forth really fast (best used in Jacob's Ladder). The movie's ultimate downfall was simply over-doing it, and by ""it"" I mean everything. There's no restraint, no subtlety. What made a film like The Shining (which has obvious thematic parallels to this one) so scary is the slow pacing and attention to detail, which allows Kubrick to fully immerse you in the eeriness. I don't know why it is so hard for Hollywood directors in 2005 to do that. Even with all it's flaws, the movie would still wouldn't have been half bad, if not for the unnecessary insertion of the requisite historical background (complete with library micro-film session). It was so outlandish and unrelated to the DeFeo murders or the Lutz haunting that it completely blew the movie for me. It was just totally out of the blue, some priest torturing Indians in his basement, whaaaat? Not to mention that the whole sequence was unbelievably cheesy and looked like a Nine Inch Nails video. While the historical background aspect works in many horror films, it all depends on how you use it, and how far of a stretch the connection is to the events of the film. In The Shining, the backstory completely justified the current story-line, in that it was pretty much a strait repetition. Just as in Blair Witch, where the vagueness of the history worked to the film's advantage to create a general sense of an undefined dark force within the woods. Amityville really misses the boat here by not making the genuinely horrifying TRUE events of the DeFeo murders the root of George's homicidal possession. Instead, it presents us with a truly outlandish tale about a sadistic puritan 400 years prior, which is said to have brought on the DeFeo murders as well. It's unfortunate that Hollywood can take such potentially rich material and create an over-the-top far-fetched popcorn flick. But I guess that's the name of the game...",The Amityville Horror
304,nitebreed,it's scary HA! only joking,4,19 May 2005,"Another remake that does not serve up what original film could something new and nail biting and would make up jump. If you have not seen the original then you would find it scary but if you have then you will not like it. Excellent special effects with the ghost girl and also contains the original news reports from the actual murder which is a nice addition. I was not gripped by the film i found it slow in most parts, but the girls where on the edge of there seat and found the movie really scary (?). The movie has a scary little girl in it but i don't no what purpose she serves. But i can't get the end scene out of my head! great scene when baby sitter is locked in a room with her. Ryan Reyonlds plays a good part in the film with some quality acting on his part.

But this version is quite good. The acting by everyone was right on. Both Reynolds and George were great, particularly George. She is a fine actress with a bright future. The kid's were great as well. Their acting alone would have made this a good movie, but the special effects and sound were fantastic as well, neither being overdone like the original. The sound was very atmospheric, the subtlety of which lent challenge to the ear.

The beginning can seem to drag on a bit, but successfully builds up the tension to the frightening climax. I think this is the most terrifying film I have ever watched but I think without the music I would have found it less scary. The Amityville Horror is firstly set in the early 20th Century and sees the DeFeo family get brutally murdered by the father, it then comes into present times and a family buy the house not knowing what's been witnessed there, then at 3.15am every morning....

The suspense was great. Everything else, well, I was not impressed.After the movie was over, I kept thinking, ""there was NOTHING that even resembled the book OR original movie"". The only similarities were to the book and they were: The DeFeo's were murdered, The Lutz family purchased the house merely a year later, the Lutz family had 3 children, George DID have dreams of murdering his family, but never acted on them (or attempted to) as in this movie, he also always felt MUCH better when he was away from the house. Other than that, the movie was pure imagination. In fact, I saw about three different Amityville movies in this one - namely Amityville II - The Possession. I was also disappointed that they changed the name of the youngest DeFeo child to ""Jodie"", when in fact, her name was ALLISON.Big YAWN.",The Amityville Horror
309,walterheape,"Old Story, Tired Formulas",1,16 April 2005,"I was 8 in 1979 and I'll never forget the night I snuck upstairs and watched the original Amityville Horror on my parents' bedroom TV. For almost two years after that I couldn't look at a rocking chair. The room I had to pass through to get to mine contained a rocking chair. I'd usually run through that room on the way to bed. I also scoured all of the houses in our town for those attic windows. When I found one I was convinced it was pure evil.I haven't seen the original as an adult but I'm sure it appears dated. Still, it has to be better than this remake. Another reviewer mentioned that this one was like ""The Ring"" and ""The Shining"" thrown in a blender. That just about sums it up.I loved The Ring. I loved the sequel too. It was just what I like in a horror film - eerie, not gory. The Ring introduced us to the new horror icon of the 2000's - the wet-haired 12 year old girl with the pale, veiny face. It worked for me. It must have worked for the directors of Amityville because she appears in it too.The Shining is one of the best, if not THE best, horror films of all time. George Lutz was certainly giving us a lot of Jack in this film. (The only thing I took away was the image of that body burned into my temples. Dang!)I won't tell people to avoid this one, 6 of us went last night and it was fun enough for a Friday night activity, but I will warn you that if you're a fan of the original you'll be sorely disappointed.",The Amityville Horror
310,faggish,Another mediocre entry into the Horror genre.,4,5 October 2005,"If you come to accept that The Amityville Horror wont be anything truly scary or original, and just have a fun time, then you will probably find it okay. Otherwise, don't even bother, because it basically rips off what worked in other films, carelessly slaps them together, and ends up not having any originality or atmosphere, and delivering jolting, yet forgettable, scares that wont have any lasting effect on you in the long run. In fact, it lacked so much originality, it was as if I was watching The Shining, had it been done by some inept filmmaker, who wouldn't know a horror film, if it slapped him in the face.Ryan Reynolds, who is usually delivering his lines in a strange fashion in some wannabe comedy, tries to cross over to the serious, I'm-going-mad, side of himself. Well, sorry Ryan, but you never came off that believable to me. When he would show streaks of madness and evil, I would always end up chuckling under my breath. You could also tell that this movie was directed at the teen girl crowd, because for half of the movie, Reynolds is running around the house half naked, almost as if he is just standing in front of the camera, modeling off his underwear. Then, there is Melissa George, who I enjoy watching, but I am still waiting for her career to take off. She was unbelievably hot in Mulholland Dr., and I wish she could have sprouted off into other, better, films. She might be the saving grace of this horror tripe, because she is always showing her skill, and trying to the best she can with a bad script such as this. And why was Philip Baker Hall in this, I mean he is one of my favorite actors, but seeing him as a priest with phony looking flies all over his face, was just silly. His character also added to the truck loads of clichés. Everyone else, going from the young daughter who is informed with every aspect of the houses' history, to the completely dumb (and slutty) baby sitter, are all just paper thin, and seem to be clueless as to what they are doing there in the first place.One thing that directors need to get through their heads while directing a horror film is this, gore should not be relied upon to scare an audience. Take the Blair Witch Project for instance, none of the action, or ghosts I guess I should say, are ever shown, and just look at how scary that film turned out. This film, expects the audience to scream at mangled, ghoulish, figures, that almost act in cartoonish manners, that we have seen so many times before. So many times, in fact, that it seems that most of the movie going audience has become immune to it. Atmosphere is another thing that Amityville lacks, which is an essential to creep people out. Rain and thunder is not all it takes to create a good atmosphere, especially when it looks as stagy and obvious as it does in this.Or, maybe I am just being to harsh. I guess this could pass as some popcorn entertainment. It does have enough jolts, and a quick pace, to keep everyone occupied. However, I am sick of every horror movie coming out lately, just passing as popcorn entertainment. When are we finally going to get a truly scary horror film, where have all the skilled directors for these types of films gone to? If you want to watch a good, scary, film, I suggest you go rent The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project, The Shining, The Ring, The Exorcist, and the list just goes on and on. I could say to go rent the original Amityville, but even that one wasn't that scary.",The Amityville Horror
311,harmonium_303,Surprisingly very good and very creepy...a good remake,8,18 April 2005,"This remake of the 1979 horror classic ""The Amityville Horror"" stars Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George as George and Kathy Lutz, the parents of a family who moves into a house that is much more sinister than it appears to be. Thinking that this movie wouldn't be too great, I wanted to see it anyway since I was very impressed with New Line's other horror remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I have to say that this is the first movie in a while to really freak me out. Sure it has those clichéd jumps and cheap scares, but somehow they all managed to make me jump. One particular scene is a scene in which the little boy wakes up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. The house is obviously creeping him out, but he braves it. All of a sudden a demented, rotting ghost appears behind him, but he doesn't know...that scene made me squeeze my popcorn bucket so hard that I completely crushed it. Not only were the scares good, but the effects were too. The infamous flies that attack the priest were fake, but they really didn't look too fake (to me at least; other users have complained that they looked too fake). Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George both did a very good job with their roles. I'm used to Reynolds doing comedic work such as Van Wilder, Buying the Cow, etc. and his role really surprised me. Although they were both very good, I felt that they were too young; Margot Kidder and James Brolin were a bit older looking than these two but it still worked. Still, the scares were the best part of the film. I don't know what it was about them, they were just so...scary I guess. This is a movie that you will want to watch at night with all the lights off and volume cranked up, otherwise it may not have the same effect. Overall, this was a surprisingly good remake that sure had plenty of jumps and scares. WARNING: I heard about a man in New York having a heart attack after watching this, and the ticket holder at the theater said that they had people coming out crying after watching it, so if you are TOO easily scared than you will probably want to rent it and watch it in the daytime...or not even see it at all. 8/10.",The Amityville Horror
312,chachadynamite,They should just slap a new name on it.,10,2 May 2005,"This gets a ten for the acting, but that's where the 10 ends. As a story, on it's own, this could be a whole new movie and not even resemble the Amityville story as told in the original book, change the names, nix the quarter moon windows and voilà. The things that made this such a scary story in the first place appear nowhere in the film, turning Allison DeFeo into the Jodi character was a little tasteless on the part of the writers. I think the pig aspect was much more creepy if you ask me, even though years later it surfaced that Jodi was actually the neighbors dog. The original film is tame in this day and age, but in it's time it was a rather frightening story, just the cover art on the book was disturbing in the fact that it was just a house, nobody on the steps with a gun or an axe, just a creepy looking house that, if lit right, could be your own house. It made you feel like every time you heard an odd noise that your house could be haunted, too. With as much material, whether true or not, that Jay Anson, and the Lutzs gave us in the original book, most of which never appeared in the first adaptation, why would they need to fill the film with things not originally documented. The most notable scenes, for example the blood dripping down the walls and staircase as they were escaping, and the terrified babysitter with braces, are overlooked for a creepy skinny guy in the basement (by the way John Ketchum was shunned for adultery, not murdering Indians) and the comic relief sitter of the remake. Which brings to light, just how many Kiss t-shirts does a kid have to wear to push the seventies environment? When did the Lutz family become climbing experts? And what shampoo is Kathy using that her hair could withstand such a yanking by the boat and come up bouncing and behaving? To compare the original to this remake and say one is better or worse than the other is like comparing the original Moulin Rouge with the updated version from a few years back. They both take place in the same location, but that's where the similarities ended for me. I still prefer Amityville 11 The Possession, of all the films made surrounding the house and it's story this one still creeps me out.",The Amityville Horror

Granted the others were made decades ago but taken as a stand alone film it re-invents what had become a tired franchise. Did it really happen? Well they're still peddling that idea so for those that think it did then maybe this will shed more light on the events for you, for those that don't...just let them have their fun. Ryan Reynolds portrays George's slow fall from sanity in a convincing fashion and for someone who has made their entire career so far from playing vaguely annoying student type characters this movie marks, for me at least, his step into the world of adult acting and he makes a really good job of it. I honestly believe he is an actor that is on his way to becoming a house hold name. The child actors start out the same as so many others but by the end of the film they are not just ""those annoying kids,"" simply due to the fact that not a great deal is required of them and they do it well.

Reynolds not working at all all 28 days, even though the house is barely affordable for them. Kids don't go to school. No neighbors to speak of. The real estate agent being scared of the house. The priest who was not a priest and barely had faith. The ""love"" scene - they had to have a mostly naked girl. The babysitter - ROFL - she was great! The little girl disappearing 1 sec, walking the roof peak the next. The building contractor whose ladder falls even though being held by 2 boys. The hidden room - typical. Looking for an escape route through the roof - I always LOVE that one in horror movies - lots of laughs. Following a 5-year old for an escape route - ROFL. Oh yeah, driving through the raining night right after seeing the priest - truly hilarious. Light shining behind her, illuminating her virtues as George finds Reynolds in the boathouse - Priceless. Oh yeah, escaping from the roof to a boat to the lake that is supposedly full of bodies. ROFL.Scares: Best is the few (5?) mins at the beginning of the Defeos. If the movie had ended there, it would have been 5 stars. A few ""flashes"" of halloween faces can get you. Best one is probably during the ""sex"" scene. The Babysitter closet scene's pretty good also.GOOD ACTING: Liked the babysitter and the little girls. BAD ACTING: Everyone else. Most of George/Reynolds scenes felt like a script reading for a stage play. Those who believe this story is real will be on the edge of their seats.",The Amityville Horror
315,tiger_critic,Pretty Good,8,20 April 2005,"Wow... this movie doesn't forgive anything. I remember I went to see it the weekend that it opened and they asked me for my ID to check if I was in fact 21. Apparently, the movie was so violent, you have to be 21 to buy the ticket... thats how it worked in my theater anyway. But the movie is intense! Great acting, great special effects, and the director did a good job with this one. I commend it. It just wasn't scary enough. More gore than anything. Kinda like THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or SAW. So if you like movies like those, you will like this one. But if you are grossed out by too much gore, stay clear from this movie.You've been warned...",The Amityville Horror

However, I do still love to see him this way. In this movie Ryan has a few one liners. I was surprised at how serious he can act. I remember seeing him in Van Wilder and Blade. In both he was so witty. Like I said he is still funny in this he just brings it to the next level. I hope to see many more movies from him. Personally, I enjoy watching him in anything because he is so hot. Now I watch to see if there are any movies he is going to be in. I recommend this movie to all Ryan Reynolds fans and to anyone who enjoyed watching the original Amityville Horror.",The Amityville Horror

318,camrik505,Aussie girl does good - film does not!,3,18 September 2007,"In keeping with tradition, Michael Bay and his tribe of predators have blown the dust off another classic and stuffed it right up!! When you hear news that there's a remake of a classic film out in cinemas/on DVD, you expect quality and results. There's nothing to see here, trust me. It is as though Bay and his cohorts somehow hit periods of creative boredom and go searching for a classic story to rehash and, once done, they twist it thoroughly out of proportion and accuracy. And, once they've dug up the past, urinated on it, and re-buried it upside down, the original can never quite be viewed the same way again. Bay and co., have done nothing to honor the 1979 version. Loosely based on an original story which was loosely based on a book loosely based on a ""true story"", this flick follows the tribulations of the Lutz family who move into the (in)famous Amityville house a year after Ronald DeFeo Jr., murders his family in their sleep (if you believe the official police version). What follows is a twenty-eight day nightmare as the Lutzes are tortured by all things evil. In many ways the film is thrown together - as Bay and associates are known for doing - incorporating inconsistent information, dis-jointed plot, ridiculous scary moments, and over-dramatization. Points to look out for: This, like the original, insists the mother of the DeFeo family (Louise) was shot in the head. In the real life murders, Louise DeFeo was shot twice in the back. I have never been able to figure out why the original film, and now this one, was so insistent on changing that detail. Point two: The film acknowledges that the DeFeo family were murdered on November 13, 1974. At least they got this right. However, this fact gets lost during the plot, and is essentially contradicted by other information which surfaces as the film goes on. This version has Ronald DeFeo Jr., moving himself into the basement on October 28, 1974 - '28' possibly appointed in reference to the Lutzes' twenty-eight days in the house. Then the film claims he murders his family TWENTY-EIGHT DAYS later! Counting on twenty-eight days from October 28 DOES NOT give us November 13! I can't believe the film was shot, edited, completed, campaigned for, advertised, put in the can and RELEASED with this glaringly obvious flaw intact - and no one noticed!! Sweet Jesus! Point three: the baby sitter, conveniently re-vamped as a vixen in this version, tells the Lutz children that Ronald DeFeo shot his family in the head. As previously pointed out, in this version only the mother and the two daughters were shot in the head. This, of course deviating from the real-life murders in which only the two daughters were shot in the head; the father, mother and two sons were shot in their backs. Point four: In the original, the Lutz daughter befriends a spirit pig called Jodie. Here's the laugh: In this version Jodie the pig is no more; instead becoming on of the DeFeo daughters - thus bumping out Allison DeFeo from the story. This is probably one of the most hilarious reinterpretations these idiots could have come up with; and it is what confirms the team's total lack of respect for the original facts. The only slightly impressive shake-up on the original story is the use of the elusive John Ketcham character from the original book. He has been coupled with the legend of the Native American Indians to create a somewhat fascinating narrative to the heavily debated origins of evil dwelling within the house. This concept wasn't explored in quite the same way in the original. Performance-wise, Ryan Reynolds was a bad choice for this role. In attempting to bring a progressively angry and violent character to the story's journey he falls flat instead with what turns out to be a self-conscious portrayal of very feminine agitation. If anyone delivers a good performance, it's Melissa George! In the midst of the contrived drama and juvenile scares, she brings something human to the role of Kathy Lutz. And this may be what would make the film at least bearable to anyone who is already familiar with the Amityville story, but would otherwise be offended by this very clumsy take on it. All in all, this is a let down. The original has much more punch. Don't rush out and get this one anytime soon!",The Amityville Horror
319,rizwansamsul-45016,This movie is very scary because it has a true story,10,6 January 2021,I really like this movie ... because it is very scary and has a true story ... you should watch it the movie .. it my favourite movie :),The Amityville Horror
320,mikereilly_1999,Entertaining but can't be taken seriously,4,3 June 2006,"I give this 4 out of 10 because there were some genuinely frightening moments, and Melissa George was pleasant to look at. Beyond that, I couldn't find much remarkable here.The Amityville Horror is not a true story: it was a hoax. The infamous house on Long Island was never haunted. Ronald DeFeo was not told to kill his family by voices in the house; he has stated that the horror is not true (though to be fair, his story, like that of the Lutzes, has changed so many times that it's impossible to take anything he or they said seriously). Check out http://chatanuga.org/Amityville.html or www.theamityvillemurders.com for more details. Bottom line: there is no evidence that any haunting ever took place, and families have lived in this house undisturbed by ghosts for thirty years. Even if the story were true, the original tale told in Jay Anson's novel ""The Amityville Horror"" is so far removed from what is recounted in this movie that there is very little resemblance.This movie would have been more enjoyable had it not been a remake of the 1979 film ""The Amityville Horror"" but an actual version of Anson's novel. Although I don't believe in the novel's veracity, it would make an excellent story put on the screen. The book had many subtle horrific elements which worked together to present a terrifying ordeal; this movie resorted to cheap thrills and gross-out effects in place of any complex terrors.In the first place, Ryan Reynolds is not believable as a deranged killer, even one under supernatural influences. He spends so much time in the first part of the film trying to be likable that when the house drives him insane he isn't formidable. James Brolin in the original ""Amityville Horror"" was much more believably dangerous. This film has been compared to ""The Shining,"" which is accurate because in that film the original Jack Torrance, played by Jack Nicholson, truly seemed maniacal, whereas Jack in the remake as played by Steven Weber was not.Secondly, there are far too many unreasonable actions in this film - even factoring in ghostly presences. As a parent I can say that the scenes involving possible harm to the youngsters would immediately result in their being removed from the premises permanently by Kathy Lutz, no matter what kind of insane rationales for sticking around (""You wanted this house,"" ""Everything we own is here,"" etc.) were given. ""Chelsea"" almost falling off the roof, ""Billy"" being ordered by George to hold logs so he could chop them, ""Michael"" encountering a ghoul in the bathroom, etc. In real life these kids would be gone to Grandma's or a hotel, period. Do not underestimate a mother's devotion to her offspring. George moves down to the basement and is never questioned why. A priest comes to bless the house and after encountering a mass of flies and rude voices commanding him to get out, flees without telling Kathy to leave as well. And again she stays there after seeing the cleric driven out by whatever is in her house.Thirdly, this movie blew some chances to be scary. No red eyes peering in through the window; no hooded figures grabbing people or pointing ominously; no ceramic lions moving around by their own volition. In the ""Amityville Horror"" legend, it seems that explanations for the terrible events always go in one of two directions: angry Indian spirits or inhuman demonic elements. I've always found the first to be completely unimpressive (if angry dead Indians could wreak havoc on whites living on their former lands, this whole country would be a mass of haunted houses from Maine to California) and the second to be far more disturbing. Having taken the first option, this movie neutered itself from the beginning for me. I will grant some credit: the scene where the priest notices Chelsea's doll, and comments that it belonged to the dead DeFeo girl, and was buried with her, was truly frightening. But when he mentioned the dead girl as ""Jodie DeFeo"" that should have struck a spark with Kathy, who knew her daughter's ""invisible friend"" as Jodie. This was the time for a horrified expression to come over Kathy's face, realizing that the dead girl was her daughter's unseen playmate (although in the original story ""Jodie"" is simply some sort of disembodied demon, not a dead human being - this would have been much scarier than portraying Jodie as a formerly living victim). Ditto for the final scene, when the Lutzes flee the house and we see the dead Jodie, who screams and is pulled down into nothingness. It was obvious that the girl who played Jodie was told to give a good loud scream, and with a humorous twinkle in her eye did so with gusto - the scene wasn't scary at all, but forced and impotent.Fourthly, and this is minor, the film is set in the 1970's but there is no sense that the characters or sets were trying to represent that era. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, I was born in the 1970's, I knew the 1970's, and what was shown here was not even an approximate version of the 1970's.Last, there was no frightening soundtrack to this film. You just can't beat the ""LA la, LA la, LA la la la la..."" of the original 1979 movie for pure scare-the-pants-off-you terror. Even in my 30s, you wouldn't catch me wandering around my own house in the dark after listening to that tune. I recall some vaguely disturbing background noise, but nothing that stood out.In conclusion, I found this a passable way to spend a weekend night, but it left me craving more: more realism, more adherence to the details of the novel, and more believability. I hope that someday Anson's novel can be transferred to the screen without the need for a lot of gimmicky scares and bogus ""This is a true story"" labels.",The Amityville Horror
321,Eversopowerful85,Amityville remake,7,9 May 2005,"Based on actual events that occurred in Amityville, New York, The Amityville Horror follows a family moving into a house which was recently the site of a grizzly mass murder. Soon after they move in, strange supernatural things begin to happen that forced them to flee 28 days later.(Good Points) Good points about the film mostly revolve around the main actors who portray their characters extremely well. Ryan Reynolds (George Lutz), known being a comedian, plays his character to a professional extent, along with Melissa George (Kathy Lutz), Lisa (Rachael Nichols), and Jimmy Bennett (Billy Lutz). Timing was play perfect and also their fear.(Bad Points) The bad points mostly go to the rest of the film. Scares we're over done, the story went by to fast, and it didn't follow the book, which I heard they intended to do.

322,carlt1911,DejaPuke To much of the same thing,3,18 October 2005,Hollyweird is producing way to many remakes of movies that the originals were lousy movies to begin with. If you look at the 1979 Amityville Horror with James Brolin and Margot Kidder it appeared to be a semi low budget film and aside from a few scenes from Brolin the acting was mediocre at best. The acting in the 2005 Amityville release with Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George was about as Boring as the first release. The only reason they made this movie is the Great old American Dollar. I am not sure what the budget was on the 1979 release but it made 86 million in ticket sales and the 2005 release made 64 million in ticket sales alone with probably another 30 million in DVD rentals. I am unfortunately of that age group that has seen most of the original movies and for the most part the regurgitated remakes being milled out are really crappy movies. I was really looking forward to the new release of War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise and even though it had some really great scenes in it the 1953 release was comparatively an overall better movie. With a 130 million budget the 2005 release could have bent the plot around a bit and ended up with a much better movie.,The Amityville Horror

I work at a movie theater and I am a huge movie buff, and I gotta say, this is a great horror flick. One of my favorite things in the film was Ryan Reynolds. He's supposed to be Van Wilder! I think doing a movie like this was refreshing for him. Ryan Reynolds did a spectacular job at being really really evil. I was actually afraid of him. I applaud his performance in the film. Melissa George did a pretty good job as well, only knowing her from ""Alias"", she was good at being the little scared wife. I'm surprised and quite happy to say that there was so female ""frontal"" nudity...who really cares, but every horror flick pretty much has it. A lot of Ryan Reynolds with no shirt on. As a woman, I thought he looked spectacular, with his chiseled lean body. Wow, where'd it come from. Must of kept it when he trained for ""Blade 2"". Lucky Lucky Alanis Morrissette. I do applaud this film because I left the theater a lil' afraid I might say. I literally ran out, cause it scared the crap out of me.

325,mfuson77,OK movie - but that's not what happened!,4,17 April 2005,"I was looking forward to this remake. Last years Dawn of the Dead impressed me, even though it was considerably different than the original; so I thought we might have another winner. Boy  was I disappointed! The Amityville Horror remake falls so flat it makes the viewer beg for some kind of film interruption. A power failure or a small fire in the projector room would have done nicely.As horror films go, it was okay. Someone seeing the moving knowing nothing about the history might actually have a good time watching this film. As someone who knows the story inside and out I found myself cringing at the storyline.The Amityville Horror remake was so far from the actual reported events that it is shameful they even put the tag line ""based on true events"". Even simple facts surrounding the Dafoe murders were incorrect.Granted there is debate whether the haunting actually even took place in real life. But putting that aside  if you are making a film based on the events as told by the Lutz family would you not try to tell that story as closely as humanly possible. Having read the book and all related material surrounding the events in Amityville in 1975 I was very surprised that this movie chose to rearrange time-lines, omit happenings and create situations that were never, ever, claimed to have happened.I guess you can say I was extremely disappointed because the real story, as told by the Lutz's, is scary on its own. Hollywood did not need to tinker with a ""true"" story to make it scarier. I also found that the 90 minute running time for this film was too short. The 1979 film (running time 2 hours), though cheesy, was better as it more fully explored the haunting, despite its own factual errors. As a 90 minute film the Amityville Horror (2005) seemed too rushed and very choppy.The acting in the film was not bad. The children were quite convincing most of the time. And Ryan Reynolds did a nice job playing a lunatic; a nice change from his Van Wilder persona. Not to mention he is a nice piece of eye candy! All in all if you know anything of the Amityville Haunting or plan on doing any research on the subject try not to be disappointed when you realize how inaccurate and flawed the Amityville Horror (2005) really is.",The Amityville Horror

Ronald DeFeo confessed to methodically murdering his parents and four siblings, and claimed it was the ""voices"" that told him to do it.

My favorite scene is when the ghost of the little girl who was killed in the house before, appears in the ""current"" little girl's room. She appears to be soaked with water and has a noose tied around her neck, which I'm sure was meant to shock and creep people out. But it makes no sense! If you watch the beginning of the movie you see that she is shot while in her closet, how they got from that to her being hanged I'll never know.Then there was whispering of evil spirits that come from the basement. Every time you hear them the camera zooms in on the heating grate. So I have to assume that the evil spirits dwell within the furnace, turning it into some kind of dark and evil furnace of doom. A truly frightening notion! So if ever I want to see a cheesy movie about a haunted house which is loosely based on a true story I'll put in the original 1979 feature.

He can do great comedies (in fact, the night before we saw ""Waiting..."" which was also great) but his performance in ""The Amityville Horror"" was beyond words. He is just that amazing. It was very easy to believe what was going on what real. What can I say? The man's a complete genius and, I believe, one of the best actors in Hollywood. The cinematic elements were some of the best I've seen. They weren't really anything that special but they looked almost completely real, like the camera could have just been following this family around for the 28 days in which the movie takes place.

339,ssheridan,Quite Good. Maybe better than the original.,7,19 April 2005,"I have always been a little leery of movie remakes, especially when it comes to classic horror films, but since I did enjoy Michael Bay's remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (even with the story changes) I figured I'd give it a try. Glad I did! Off the top of my head, this is the only horror remake that I can think of that surpasses the original. This may be because I was never a big fan of the original, thinking it quite timid after such classics as the The Omen & The Exorcist (Ok, it's 32 years later and I'm still frightened by that movie), or because I have never found Margo Kidder much of an actress. Either way, I think the new remake will stand on it's own and I cannot wait to add it to my collection so I can revel in the frights for years to come.",The Amityville Horror
340,Highly_Suspicious,lazy film making fumbles the ball,6,19 April 2005,"Horror films rely on many things to achieve fear. Acting for one thing: you can't empathize with 2 dimensional characters. Camera work for another: fear is what you CAN'T see, and if the cinematographer decides to use clichéd visual devices such as lightning ad nausea and full face shots of stereotype demons/dead children etc. it loses the sense of dread and horror and replaces it with disgust and irritation. The score is almost THE most important ingredient: simple, eerie composition that is used to intelligently accompany the story rather than as a sound effect (i.e. 'shock' moments that involve almost the whole orchestra for one ugly beat). Speaking of story, we come to another aspect: too many films like this fail because they try to explain EVERYTHING. There should be minimal complicated back stories that detract from the here and now, and if they are necessary, perhaps when everything is moving to an inevitable finale and their involvement in the plot has little or no effect it isn't the best time to introduce them. WTF was the point of the 'evil priest'??! Okay, the movie. Melissa George is great. Everything Naomi Watts isn't. She's interesting, understated, mature. Ryan is a bit of a mystery to me. Not bad per se, but an uncomfortable choice none the less. His character arch is too exaggerated. His dark turn happens too fast, without enough interaction with the house. The house itself (i think of it as a character) doesn't have the same presence as the original. The sense of menace isn't as palpable. Overall the sense of dread is lost to short, sharp ghost-train thrills, and while it might appeal to an impatient teenage audience, a more discerning crowd is left wanting more. The back story, as mentioned above, is useless, and serves no purpose. Once again, WTF is the deal with the 'evil priest'??! Isn't it scarier not to know the whole story of the house? Maybe a hint of an Indian burial ground or a rumor of an old sanitarium, but an Indian sanitarium with a psycho priest??! Please! Overall, lazy film making that doesn't exploit its genuinely unnerving material, opting instead to inject tired Hollywood devices into a tired script. The remake of the TexasChainsaw... was better. Lets hope the remake of the Hitcher does something interesting...",The Amityville Horror

George Lutz himself has panned this movie. DO NOT waste your time or money. Luckily I got the ticket free with the Amityville box set. If you want to see the case as it really happened go to www.amityvillehorrortruth.com . Do not follow this poor excuse of a film. Someone apparently told Ryan Reynolds that his talents were beyond two guys a girl and a pizza place. Whew!!!!! How wrong they were.

I thought that, although I don't completely believe the story (plot holes and such in the actual people accounts), this was a great horror movie. Ryan Reynolds was a classic choice to play the possessed husband. He plays the part just as well as Jack Nicholson did in The Shining. This movie made me jump. There was actually a part when I covered my eyes, much to the humor of my boyfriend. If you're looking for a good creepy movie to see, this is the one!

Not so much the movie, but that I thought it was all true (with some obvious fabrications on the part of the writers). The creep factor with the little DeFeo girl was good, especially with the babysitter. And the children who played the Lutz kids did a good job. But not enough happened with the house and the back story with the DeFeo's. They also don't spend enough time showing how the rest of the family became possessed. They just focus on George and the little girl. But it was still creepy. But then I find out that the real Lutz family lied about everything that happened in that house just to get out of the mortgage, and the movie lost its appeal. If you are up for a thrill and have a weak stomach then go see this movie, but if you are going to see it because you think it actually happened, then don't waste your time or your money.",The Amityville Horror
344,jpaulin-1,a solid horror film with intense feeling,9,19 March 2006,"This film grasped my attention for every minute of it running. I found the feeling intense, as the film concentrates tightly on the life of this family that moves in to a new house that has a tragic past. Things start to happen, and even though there are not particularly surprising plot turns, I think the film deserves its place. I found other reviews about this film which were quite the opposite and I was surprised - but one difference is that I've not seen the older version of the film.The milieu, a certain solitude and the grandness of the house; nearby water and a boat shack, these are all quite classic for a horror film. It's thrilling to see how the house starts to haunt the family, the father cracking down bit by bit, reality melts with illusion and the once happy family becomes a gloomy and desperate lot. I would certainly recommend the film.",The Amityville Horror

346,adia07,You've GOT to be kidding me! ** Spoilers**,1,16 April 2005,"ANYONE who thinks this movie is even moderately worthwhile must not get out much. I'm all for having your own opinion and if someone enjoy's something, then that's cool with me.But let me tell ya. I didn't enjoy this crap fest one bit.AMITYVILLE HORROR (the remake) has suddenly become about....well...a house with some ghost in it (that looks like Van Helsing with bad skin.) Gone is the subtlety of ""what the hell is that house doing to these people."" Now it's more along the lines of ""whose that little girl with the Halloween makeup doing in every scene?"" I mean, even with makeup the little girl was adorable. She wasn't creepy. She was a kid who stood very still until the director yelled action, then said her dumb line, and went back to her mark.This little girl, JODIE, also appears in situations that have NOTHING to do with her history. She was killed by her brother in the closet. After the Lutz' move in, she is seen rocking in a chair, held by two gray arms on the roof of a closet with, what appears like, a Cathedral Ceiling, flailing her arms. (Um, guys, she's dead, so not much we can do about her being attacked by disembodied arms.) Then we see her watching the Lutz' doing it, by standing at the edge of the bed, with a rope around her neck and her tongue sticking out of her mouth. (It actually looked cute. The girl seemed to be playing.) Why, I ask, was there a rope around her neck? Jodie was shot in the head, not hanged. It makes no sense.As for Ryan Reynolds, well, kudos for using your hard earned money on a trainer that I am desperately trying to hire. He's not even half bad, but come one, the moment he steps into that house he suddenly becomes a moody bastard. ""Um, honey...something's wrong with you."" There is no build-up, just a sudden change that his wife should have seen instantly by the creepy-eye contacts he was wearing. But no, apparently she was far-sighted.In a bathroom scene, the little boy of the house, whom we get to see pee and shake his ""thingy"" to make sure it's all out, stands at the bathroom mirror as a pus drooling person/demon/thingy appears with it's obligatory scare music, next to him. (Sorry for the run-on sentence.) I asked myself, who the hell is that? Isn't this a possessed house movie? And herein lies the problem. This movie has hardly anything to do with the original Amityville story that scared the crap out of me as a kid. Where's JODIE the pig? The red eyes that glared into the window of the little girl's room? Where's the subtlety of the foul smells and the chronic fly problem? Where's an ending that doesn't have the family going UP ONTO THE ROOF of the house to get away from crazy daddy? Better yet, why does the family tie daddy up and drag him to the boathouse, load him onto the boat, and drive away from the house , rather than just getting into the car that was 10 feet away? The dialogue is a charmer. When the priest blesses the house and is slammed with a million CGI flies, he flees from the house with Kathy chasing after him. ""Why are you leaving us?!!"" He says nothing, just leaves them. Never calls to explain. Doesn't get them help. Nothing. Ah, the Catholic church.When she finally confronts the priest on his turf, the man who just abandoned them like a frightened school girl, says ""I don't like your house."" I imagine her next line to be, ""Was it the drapes?"" In the end, an entire history was built to explain the house. Something completely fabricated and really really stupid. The scariness of the true story is just that, that it was true. If you make a movie that is completely made up, we're really just watching another horror movie. One we'd see on television. Like TNT.This was such a waste and too bad, because it could have been a genuine creeper. But instead, the producers decided to give us a quick edited crap fest guaranteed to make a bundle opening weekend and then die out faster than a silverfish in my bathtub.",The Amityville Horror
347,JohnHere,Movie Opinion/True Story?,5,15 April 2005,"This move was just ""OK"". The plot happened too fast. As soon as George Lutz moved into the house he was possessed. There should have been more of a build up to the climax. And the CGI flies...the real flies from the 1970s movie would have been better to use again. I would say the movie is OK to see if you just want to pass time on a Saturday night, but don't expect anything extraordinary.SPOILER ---> I don't know if this really counts as a movie spoiler, but the Amityville Horror was a complete hoax thought up by the Lutz family and the defense lawyer of Ron Defeo (who murdered his entire family with a .35c rifle while they slept), who happened to work in the same office building as Pretince Hall publishing (the company who published the first book). Ron Defeo didn't murder his family because he heard voices in a possessed house...he has admitted time and time again that he wanted the $200k life insurance policy money to sustain his drug habit. Keep in mind that MGM is capitalizing on 4 children aged 9, 11, 13, 18 who were shot to death. This entire movie is a hoax.",The Amityville Horror
348,hereandnow1,scariest movie in a long time,9,17 April 2005,"the atmosphere and acting this remake were perfect. I have seen many a horror flick that have horrible atmosphere and even worse acting(the recent darkness and boogie-man to name a few) the performance of Mr Reynolds was great. he gave off that crazy,lost my mind look when he was supposed to and a weak man losing his nerve when it called to it. Andrew Douglas did an excellent job of maintaining a creepy and chilling atmosphere, especially with the amazing climax. the length of the film was something i was very happy with as well. it was about 95 minutes and really seem like it too. like another reviewer said it really felt like we were going through the 28days that they were living in the house, and I second that feeling. I have seen many horror movies in my life that haven't done as good a job of actually horrifying me like this movie. i recommend this movie to all horror fans and to any one looking to have nightmares for a very long time(even I have had a few since watching) rating:9/10",The Amityville Horror
349,ds17studd,The Grudge Doesn't Even Come Close!!!!!!!!!!,8,25 April 2005,"After seeing the Grudge, I pondered and said to myself, ""Not a bad movie, but a little far fetched."" With the Amityville Horror, starring Ryan Reynolds (a fellow Canadian), I was not only impressed by the film, however, I was also impressed with Reynolds' performance, being that he was used to starring in particularly teen humor movies. With this, we saw a different side; a new aspect that will open the doors for him in many other films. Anyways, I agreed with how the film was directed until the Priest visits the house and is scared away by a flock of demonic flies, accompanied by the voice (Get Out!) Why didn't the Priest summon some hierarchy from the church and perform a mass exorcism? - I don't believe the Lutz family was part of the ""true story"" therefore I think that part could have been done better. Also, I can understand the friendship Chelsey develops with the ghost girl Jodie, seeing that the Ghost longed for a friend to play with, until she tries to get Chelsey to jump off the roof to see her father, only that Jodie just wanted Chelsey to join her for eternity. Finally, I was surprisingly disturbed with the story of the deranged lunatic who tortured American Indians and then slit his own throat so his spirit would remain in the house forever. Scary, spontaneous, and original, this film deserved at least an 8/10 for a horror movie.... As for the guy that rated it a 2/10 and commented on it like he was the intellectual, I believe that the majority found it well done and original; if that horror movie was a 2/10, then the best horror movie ever made (The Exorcist) was only a 3/10. Come on, I think maybe this guy should be a director, and see how difficult it is to create something the majority of the population thinks is above par... Focker OUT!",The Amityville Horror

If you in for a ride... here it is. This has been the scariest film I have ever seen! I think it is the scariest film ever created in the last 20 years. I cannot wait until it hits the stores. I cant wait to have a nightmare on it either! All the perfect elements are in this perfect Horror.

351,lord_malasombra,A big WHY?,1,22 October 2005,"Before I start in on this movie let me first say that I never thought I'd be singing the praises of an ex Aussie soap star but Melissa George is both a beautiful and natural actress who acquits herself with exemplary style in what is otherwise a complete turkey from start to finish. It's fair to say that I wasn't too impressed with the original movie but this...well, WHY? Why was it made? Why did anyone go to see it? Why did I spend the time watching it when I could have been having my teeth extracted? This movie is duff on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. Although hardly a classic, at least the original had some suspense and some truly creepy moments. This, on the other hand, spoon-feeds the ""chills"", and I use the term loosely, at a rate of knots bordering on the desperate. The story rushes from one scene to the next so that you never get time to see the family as a united whole before the onset of ""terrifying"" events begin to strain their seams. In other words, you don't really see any appreciable change or deterioration in their family unit. The ghosts and goblins owe more to Ring and Jacob's Ladder than anything else and let's face it, we're kind of inured to those particular creepies now. I could sit here all night dissecting this movie but I think I've already spent enough time on it and, if you've read this, so have you! It's even worse and more pointless than the Psycho remake. All I can say in conclusion is to agree with another reviewer who advised not to spend any money on this movie but to wait for it to turn up on television. IF there's nothing else on!",The Amityville Horror
352,ffolkes-4,Visual effects don't make up for an awful remake,4,10 October 2005,"I enjoy thriller movies which are based around myth, legend, and history (even if only fictional), because it encourages the viewer to use their imagination. Sadly, this movie falls far short of my expectations. Like so many other people, I anticipated a more complete version of the original - and like so many other people, I was disappointed. I could go on and on about how much better this version could have been written, but I can't without spoiling it.All I'll say is this: Think of every thriller you've seen in the past 10 years, then put those memories into an Amityville Horror mold, and you've got this highly predictable remake which embodies everything ""wrong"" about modern movies.The only thing that compelled me to rate this 4/10 stars as opposed to 2, were impressive and relatively believable performances by Chloe Moretz and Jesse James. Also, the slight explanation on the vague history of the land was pretty chilling, but they failed to expound on it - a big mistake in my opinion. Don't get me wrong though, I thought the overall quality and feel was great - fairly good cinematography, good soundtrack, etc. - it's just that the plot was confusing and boring, and no character was given even the slightest chance to evolve.",The Amityville Horror

(sarcasm (every terrible horror movie ever made)5) Flies attacking a priest who tries to exercise the house (this is no lie...it is the same actor who played the priest in exorcist) same fly scene as well.6) every three minutes they throw in a ""jump"" scene to make up for the absence of terror in this movie (again every poorly constructed horror movie)the last complaint, well last id like to discuss, the film takes place in 1975, but i think the director forgot this half way through the movie and threw in 90's memorabilia.

354,perfect14u,"Worth Watching, Not the Best",7,16 April 2005,"For a remake, this was not bad...but it wasn't excellent either. I suppose a viewer who knew nothing of the story beforehand would be thoroughly entertained, but since I know a lot about the actual events, I had a few problems with it. The producers had said they wanted this film to not be a repeat of the original, yet focus more on the book. This really didn't happen, though. The movie had a lot of ""Hollywood"" elements, including the big finale, which was not in the book. And the thing of it is, there are some great incidents from the book they could have played on to be more effective, but they left them out (such as the white hooded figure they saw, the red room in the basement, etc.). And Jodie would've been scarier if they left it as a pig! On a plus side, there was good character development (which is rare in films today) and the actors gave a nice performance. The film definitely had its share of humorous lines and creepy scares...I just think they could have done a little more with it. It's definitely worth watching, though.And one thing that really puzzled me...when they show clips of home movies from when the moved in, there is a quick clip of the two sons playing in the water. They moved in the house around December...wouldn't the water be a little cold in Long Island??? At any rate, it's worth watching and could be a great date movie.",The Amityville Horror
355,scaraco-1,"FAR exceeded my expectations, scared the CRAP out of me!",9,16 April 2005,"***VERY MINOR POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN PARAGRAPH 4***I was only 9 years old when the original AH came out. My mom was foolish enough to take my sister (age 10 at the time) and me to see the movie at the drive-in theater. Needless to say, I had nightmares. I hadn't seen the original movie again until about 20 years later when it came out on DVD. Of course I had a much better appreciation for it.Anyhow, I didn't really know what to expect when going to see this re-make. Generally speaking, I'm the kind of guy who doesn't really believe in re-making a true classic (""if it ain't broke....""). For example, when I heard they re-made Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, I nearly vomited. Anyhow, I figured this movie would be ""just okay"" at best. Boy, was I wrong!The house was simply amazing. The cinematography was brilliant. A fantastic performance by Ryan Reynolds (who is looking QUITE good in this movie I must add!). And it was just enough ""different"" from the original that it wasn't predictable, and it literally scared the crap out of me. VERY MINOR POSSIBLE SPOILERS HERE: I would have given this movie a ""perfect 10"" but I deducted one point because of a few little things that kinda bothered me: 1) the unconvincing contact lenses used to try and make George Lutz's eyes look all bloodshot and over-tired, or stressed, or whatever - they looked rather fake to me; 2) The fact that the haunting Amityville Horror THEME is NOT used at all in this movie was quite disappointing (the fact that you hear it in the trailer is very deceiving, it's not in the actual movie); and 3) The lightning at the beginning of the movie is way over- used. I mean, come on, even the worst storms in the world don't have THAT much lightning!Other than that, this was one HELL of a movie - I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will highly recommend it to all my friends, and especially my sister, whom I'm sure will be very scared when she sees it!",The Amityville Horror

However I was quite disappointed.There were a couple of really good scares but there was so much potential for more - the potential so unrealized that I would barely even call it a horror movie.Like it or not, films like The Ring and The Grudge have set the standard for today's horror, so for me bland movies like this that don't even come close just aren't worthwhile unless they contain substance of some other form.

The grey faced girl from 'The Ring' and 'Grudge' is here with her pencilled in veins and greased up hair(wasn't Jody a pig in the original story?), the soundtrack is an mix of copies, with the odd bar of 'Alien' here and there- to an actual exact copy of the theme from TV show 'The Outer Limits' as it's end title! (get the lawyers on that one boys!)'Poltergeist' effects (not the good ones) are just everywhere, dialogue creates ""tell me he didn't just say that"" at every turn. The director has no idea how to build suspense (or that feel of dread that gets you watching through your fingers!) he just resorts to on screen 'jumps' and orchestral stabs to keep you awake. The confused direction and unstructured script make it quickly spiral out of control.Unoriginal, uninspiring and bland. Bad acting, bad direction, ridiculous effects and poor score.

I thought the acting was really good, especially from the children because they acted pretty mature for this movie, since they were so young and all. I think the crew did an excellent job on the plot, I didn't really know it, I just read a little summary of the book. I really wanna read the book now and I think I will.

Not because the movie was good, but because of all the re-makes being made, this was the only one that did any justice to the original.I would suggest if you were to watch Ammutyville, that you watch the remake. It has infinitely more scary content in it, but only compared to the original. Standing alone, it didn't have that many scares. There was a bathroom scene taken from The Sixth Sense that was really stupid, and some unoriginal scenes involving gore and torture. In fact, that is where the movie began to sink in quality for me. The movie played out pretty good about 3/4 through the movie, but ultimately the end just sank it.This was supposed to stick closely to the book, but the ending didn't have anything to do with what supposedly happened.

362,fabph4ntom,The schlocky horror picture show,4,17 July 2005,"In the cinematic year of the remake, one will stand as the film that has completely shaken my faith in the future of motion pictures.Mgm's swan song ""The Amityville horror"" has ,during, its 90 odd minute running time ,compleatly exhorted my persistence with the movie industry.After the debacle earlier in the year that was ""Cursed"", I was really looking forward to this,not only a chiller that was proud enough to wear it's ""R"" rating on its sleeve but as the first remake of a film that, I saw and loved growing up and got me so immersed in the world of cinema and of horror in the first place. It was probably too much to ask for in this era of CG monstrosities, to expect the subtle approach but little did I expect the bombardment of limp visual effects that raped my senses throughout.First and foremost, what the original and the 1982 prequel "" Amityville 2:the possession"" did was take their time, flesh out the family, let the house slowly work its dark magic tearing them apart from the inside-out, the terror manifesting itself psychologically, before going for the jugular in the finale both had a near 2hr running time, this feels like little more than an extended commercial or an Alice Cooper video, all quick fix jump cuts and shrieking music cues, no story, no care.Another frustrating element is the blatant disregard shown, not only for existing material but also for it's own.The set ups are made for dramatically satisfying pay-offs but they are constantly sacrificed at the alter of multiplex accessibility.In one scene,the little girl alludes to child abuse while Kathy puts her to bed, yet the whole subject is dropped for the rest of the picture, So instead of a confrontation between George and Kathy that would have acted as the final wedge between this fledgling family and thus the catalyst for George to give in to the house's hold over him we get - MORE- CG! Two other such set-ups are squandered, one where George listens in on Kathy and her eldest, as she promises him that George will never replace the boys father in her heart and the second, when George overhears the boys saying how much they hate him.What would have been interesting would of been to use the former as a conformation of George's fear, that he was only being used by this mother as a provider for herself and her children and have the kids in the latter, be upstairs saying positive things about George, while the house has him hearing negative things down in the basement.The overriding feeling though, is that this is less a psychological ghost story and more a loosely strung succession of limp set pieces, rounded off with the most laughably over the top final act I've ever seen.One big positive though and the films saving grace - Ryan Reynolds,apart from being possibly the sexiest man alive, he is absolutely sensational as the gentle, blue collar family man under the influence of some decidedly mean spirited spooks, he has to walk a fine line here between sympathetic and all out terrifying and he doesn't slip once, a huge star in the making hampered by a dreadful vehicle.I think that even as a fan of the first two movies it has come time after six dire sequels and a woeful remake to admit defeat and condemn a certain property in Amityville New york.",The Amityville Horror
363,blood-guts-and-gore,Spin-Chillingly Great!!,10,23 October 2005,"Scarier, more horrifying, more creepy than the original. First time feature film director Andrew Douglas keeps the audience at the edge of their seats with this nail-biting tale of ghosts, possession and fear. This is truly the King of all Camp-fire ghost stories. If you were scared by 'The Poltergeist' then you'll be hiding behind your sofa for weeks to come. The movie makes you jump out of your seat again and again. It is truly a pulse-pumping, heart-racing, roller-coaster ride of terror. I've read the book and I think Jay Anson would be proud of this chilling masterpiece. A few adjustments have been made since the novel hit the shelves back in 1977 but in the end I think it lived up to its expectations. Compelling acting from Ryan Reynolds and Mellissa George made this 'Based on a True Story' movie even more real. This horror flick is everything Stanley Kubricks 'The Shining' wanted to be and MORE. After watching this movie I think its fair to sat that Ghost Stories will never be the same again.",The Amityville Horror
364,akhilnellikunnel,Absolute scary one,9,24 April 2019,"I have been searching for this kind of horror movies in recent times.This one was lit.Even this is a remake,it is better than the original.

Must watchable horror movie....",The Amityville Horror
365,noodle_salad,Frighteningly bad.,2,19 April 2005,"The trailer is excellent; the movie is not. A good horror movie will start off with a few minor frights, gradually building in intensity. This one starts off with a scene in which lightening hits every millisecond, and too much information is revealed too early. That lightening is a good indicator for the rest of the movie, as ghost after ghost is predictably thrown in repeatedly. This method fails to build any tension, or generate real scares.The movie also fails to retain any of the genuine freakiness of the original. The original babysitter/closet scene very simplistic, but it worked well. The scare factor there hedged on the door being ""locked"" for no reason, and the girl's complete apathy towards the sitter's panic. In effect, it is like watching a scene in which someone is drowning while the only other person who can help just stares and lets it happen. The new babysitter scene is cheesy by comparison, as is every other event they tried to duplicate (the priest, walls bleeding).The original film is very dated, and I was hoping for a nice updated version with better effects. It looks like I'll have to keep waiting.",The Amityville Horror
366,pedro1172,"""For God's Sake Stay Away!""",2,13 April 2005,"I saw a preview screening of this last night, and most of my feelings for this film have been pretty accurately described by ""dharv"" in their review below. This film is terrible, and my two friends and I all couldn't wait for it to end. Then again, we're all in our 30s so we're exactly twice the age of the intended audience for this attempt at horror.Put ""The Ring"" together with ""The Shining"" in a blender and you get this film, minus the truly striking visuals. Ryan Reynolds is there show off his non-70's hair and impressive abs; his character is unlikable from the very start and almost IMMEDIATELY upon moving into the house begins to act like he's possessed. The minute Melissa George has to start emoting her acting ability goes out the window (she's from the ""if you're upset rub your arm"" school of acting). The kids are passable, and Phillip Baker Hall is wasted as the priest. As for the woman who plays the babysitter, the less said the better.Saying this film is better than the original is like comparing apples to oranges. While the 1979 version has not dated well, it at least had a slow build and true atmosphere, neither of which are accomplished here. This film is more concerned with the typical specter suddenly appearing behind someone/jump cuts/shaking camera work like in every other contemporary horror film that tries to look like a Nine Inch Nails video. If you get bored, start counting how many times lightning strikes in the film, how many times they show the boathouse doors moving back and forth or how many times the director closes up on the ""spooky"" air vent. I'm surprised I didn't leave the theater with grill marks on my face.",The Amityville Horror

368,sdowning2,The magic is missing,3,13 October 2006,"When magicians start to learn their art, they often try to pile as many elements as they can into one effect. The result is that the audience doesn't know what the magic was supposed to be. So it is with this remake. The audience loses track of just what it is they are to fear. This film is a horrible, muddled piece of crap. In the original story, Jodie was actually a pig, not one of the victims. As I recall, Jodie was one of the forces that caused the massacre. The evil forces/effects also built more slowly in the first film. In this one, no sooner are they in the house than we start to see over-the-top evidence of haunting. George very quickly becomes subject to the evil forces, although there is not enough explanation for that, nor is there sufficient motivation for his new family to come to his aid at the film's sorry climax. All in all, this is a very unsatisfying film.",The Amityville Horror
369,dabomb_rules,over all a scary good time :),8,21 April 2005,"Well i saw the remake last night, and boy let me say.. i was more then pleased with this classic horror. The acting was quite decent, and I'm not just talking about Ryan Renolds or Melissa George, I'm also talking about the 4 young children who are also in the movie, Jesse James, Jimmy Bennet, Grace Moretz, and Isabel Conner (who plays Jodie Defeo). AVH didn't just give us a cheap quick scare, and it didn't just give us blood on the walls, and random deaths that serve no purpose, this was a true horror movie, with just the right amount of thrills, and chills. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to spend 2 hours excited, on the edge of your seat, and over all just plain scared :)",The Amityville Horror
370,jimmorrisons,Pretty darn good,10,17 April 2005,"I really dug this flick. It really added to the ongoing legend of the Amityville horror house on Long Island. It was made by the same people that re-made ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" last year, so I had a pretty good idea it would be a decent re-make as well. This version definitely has more gore and a few shocks that were not in the original. But that's a good thing. Anyone who witnessed that exact duplicate re-make of ""psycho"" a few years back will remember how boring it is to make a re-make exactly like the original, including the same dialouge and screenplay.. Like, how original(not)... Anyhow, ya, this is a great horror film. And I don't care what the sceptics say..That damn house was haunted!!!!! I hope next is a ""prequal"" showing the actual DeFoe murder case...",The Amityville Horror
371,clintfive-1,A hoax about a hoax...stick to the original!,4,17 September 2007,"You know the story: Family of five moves into curious-luxurious home on the strength of its alluringly low price. Twenty-eight days later they tip out the door - yes, it's PMT time again for the Amityville demons, people! This is but another pointless remake by the same basic team of comic book nerds who subjected us to ""The Day After Tomorrow"", and their other pointless remake, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". These are a team of serial offenders who look at a classic, and get the inspiration to commit rape. And this is the result...let it speak for itself. Why do they do it? Well, it seemed to them that this was juicy enough to re-hash - yep, someone was desperate for the money - and it plays out like this: DeFeo family of six is murdered in a Dutch Colonial home (changed dramatically for this remake) in November, 1974 by their eldest son, Ronnie. A year later, the Lutz family are looking for a home and stumble across this one. A month of horror follows as the family wade their way through whatever new demonic torture the producers could come up with in their attempt to out-do the original (1979). Most of this, like their other disasters, is filled with scares just for the sake of it. Lotsa filler, no thriller. And the details of the original DeFeo murders are thrown completely out the window as the unfolding story reveals the flaws in the producers' total inability to research dates and times, etc. One such example is the recurring reference to the twenty-eight day time frame. Specially tailored for this version, Ronnie DeFeo sets up residence in the family basement on October 28 - whoop, there it is again! Twenty-eight days later (yep, you guessed it) he murders his family. But, the family was murdered on November 13!! What the??!! Someone stuffed up big time here, guys! And, to make this inconsistency even more laughable, the OPENING shot of the movie clearly has ""November 13, 1974"" on the bottom of the screen, introducing the following montage portraying the actual murders! Figure it out! Don't get me started on the performances. Who thought to cast Ryan Reynolds in the role of George Lutz? He struggled with the character, his delivery was forced and, as his George Lutz character changes progressively throughout the film, he regresses more into a tantrum-throwing sook as compared to James Brolin's aggressive and dominant heavy in the original. In the thick of the ridiculousness, someone thought it would be hot to turn the babysitter in this one into a tart, as opposed to Amy Wright's very conservative, straight-A, retainer-wearing do-gooder from 1979. Again, what was the point? And, here we go, another flaw: During her conversation with the Lutz children, she claims Ronnie DeFeo went from room to room splattering his family's heads as they slept. Pardon us. Only two were shot in the head, and one of them wasn't the mother, although, like in the original, this version also claims the mother was shot in the head. The only remotely outstanding performance in this film came from Melissa George - and that's not a biased view just because I'm also Australian. She actually managed to produce something real within what were obviously very limited confines thanks to the director. If there was room to move, she did it. All in all this is another piece of confectionery like so many other remakes in recent years. There's nothing really here to sink your teeth into other than that fickle element of circus present in all the movies made by these guys and a few scares methodically thrown in at certain time measures throughout the film in an attempt to basically keep us from boredom. No consistency. My advice? STICK TO THE ORIGINAL!! Much more substance. Clint, Australia.",The Amityville Horror

Jay Anson, the author of the book, has since come forward with the ""Lutzs"" to verify that they contrived the entire story. So the truth is, no. The story is pure fiction.But if you are looking for a good horror story this is one to choose.The movie does not rely on special effects. The movie instead relies upon good storytelling. The original is better than the remake. For someone who gave a cheesy performance as Lois Lane in the Christopher Reeves Superman movies Margot Kidder's performance in this movie really stands out as one of her best performances. But the best performance of the entire movie goes to James Brolin.Although the actors in this remake gave a great performance they don't hold a candle to the original. 9 out of 10 stars (would have been 10 but they perpetuated the story as real for many, many years: I.E. - they lied).",The Amityville Horror
375,Thalydimide,This Amityville is just another ghost story....,4,18 April 2005,"First of all, I must say that all the reviewers who raving about this flick and rating it a 10 must not have ever seen a really scary movie. The biggest problem with the film is they virtually gutted the original premise of demonic possession. In the book and the original film, the house was possessed and exerted it's influence upon George. However, they essentially tossed out this whole foundation of the story and replaced it with a ghost story and a really lame evil preacher. Seriously, why the hell would they concoct that ridiculous back story of the preacher who tortured native Americans in the basement that the house was built upon?! That is one tired cliché. So, instead of a real demonic presence, we get a ghost of a little girl. It makes for some creepy moments, but nothing actually scary. The Japanese based ghost stories of the last few years, The Ring and The Grudge for example, had much better scares. If you take away the big evil demon, who is left to intone ""Get Out!""? Sadly, no one. Thus the priest makes a very brief appearance to facilitate the appearance of the flies. I guess they decided to keep at least one or two things that worked from the originals.I really wanted to love this Amityville Horror. It is the last independently produced MGM film and it is sad to see that legacy end. Unfortunately, Michael Bay has now taken two iconic 70's horror films and managed to make them boring.",The Amityville Horror
376,brokenjukebox,"Not seen the original, but everything else in this film has been done better before",1,29 April 2005,"Having not seen the original I can't compare the two, but this movie is just terrible. I enjoyed it a little in a ""so bad it's good way"", but this film is one of the worst I've ever seen.A bland, cardboard cut-out All-American family move into a scary haunted house, and of course weird things start to happen, namely ghosts start appearing and whispering, the walls bleed and the step-dad goes crazy and tries to kill all of them. In another words, every horror cliché in the book. We have the little kid who sees and talks to dead people, the Catholic priest from The Exorcist who tries to get rid of the evil things in the house, the concerned young blonde mother who researches all the history of this to protect her children- they're all here, and cheap rip-offs of them at that.The worst thing about this is film is it's just so bland and boring. Even the most casual movie watcher will have seen all this before. The script is silly, and the obviousness of it all is annoying- lets buy a spooky house where those brutal murders were committed last year. Let's not try and escape when daddy starts going nuts- let's not even notice he's going nuts beside his bloodshot eyes and how happy he looks when wielding an axe. Let's try and escape by climbing on the high roof.The supernatural and historical sides of the story are bought up and disgarded- the ghost of Jodie one of the little girls who got murdered seems important to begin with then buggers off somewhere until the end and looks sad. Should have made more of an effort love. An important revelation as to why evil spirits are possessing young men and making them kill their families in the first place- the house was built on a site where an evil psychotic priest slaughtered and tortured Native Americans- is squeezed into the end and is forgotten about. It seems more of an excuse than an explanation.The family in question have no character to speak of, and the acting is by large sub-par. Ryan Reynolds spends most of the film looking like some demented cave man, Melissa George, who I have fond memories of as Angel in Aussie soap Home And Away, plays a character who is such an airhead and is so unbelievably stupid she deserves everything she gets. The kids have very little to do. Michael is just there to be sickly sweet and look wide-eyed. Chelsea is probably the best of the kids, but she too is just sickly sweet and looks wide-eyed, apart from befriending the long-dead Jodie. See The Sixth Sense, The Others, the Ring etc about little kids who can talk and befriend dead people.Billy is just a whiny little brat who doesn't like his new step-dad.The only character I liked was Rachel Nichols as the trashy bad babysitter Lisa, who got the only intended funny scene when Billy is fancies her and changes his mind about needing a babysitter. She's also the only interesting character, being a total bitch, and her appearance is all too brief.With this family I just didn't care if they got brutally slaughtered or not. Sadly, they all make it out alive. The only death in this film apart from the flashbacks is a dog, which is a real cop-out.If you want a good laugh at how bad Hollywood can be then this may be a movie to check out. But surely there are better ways to spend an hour and a half of your life.",The Amityville Horror
377,tangeriness,"Totally Cheesy, Totally Fun",8,25 April 2005,"So I had read countless reviews saying that the new Amityville was awful. I was sad to read that, because I thought the previews looked good, even though I thought the original was boring. I've been watching horror movies for a long time, long enough to hardly be affected anymore. I went with a friend of mine, and we both loved it. Neither of us have ever reacted to a movie the way we did during this one. Yeah, the movie is cheesy, I don't think that's entirely unintentional. The best horror movies, the ones we all remember, are cheesy. If you want to enjoy this movie, which I did to the fullest capacity, you've got to keep in mind that horror movies have one purpose. They want the audience to scream and jump. There are tons of jump scenes in this movie, and it seems that people bash these for not being truly scary, because after a few viewings they won't scare you anymore. Maybe that's true, but I'm the kind of person that doesn't like haunted houses for being creepy, I like them for when someone pops out and scares the hell out of me just by screaming ""Boo!"" So if you're like me, you'll like this movie. 27 times better than the original, at least. Movies generally don't scare me, this one made me spill my popcorn.",The Amityville Horror

I suppose you could say that it is loosely based upon the events we all know and regard as 'The Amityville Horror'. This movie is not a documentary and makes no attempt to be accurate with any documentation pertaining to the supposed haunting, so I abstained from basing the movie off the original accounts. That being said, I went into the movie with an open mind and high expectations. The latter was a bad move.This movie is not a good one. It starts out eerily similar to Bays The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) with a police account of the Defeo murders. This opening montage is creepy and very well done. I believe the first 15 to 20 minutes of the film are strong and gave hope to us skeptics. Then it goes all wrong.When does Lutz begin to slip into madness? He seems to go from zero to crazy in five cinematic minutes. Why the useless eye candy? Does Reynolds really need to jump in the lake, or did they just want the 45 second pan shot with the ab flex in full effect? Why the half naked, druggie babysitter? Why does she ask the twelve year old son to make out? Was Wes Craven helping out on this flick or what? Why the CGI flies? And why do we have to wait until half way through the movie for the priest to bless the house anyway? There is more. Much more. I will leave that to you.Needless to say, this full theatre of 250+ people laughed their way through this movie. I was very disappointed, being a huge horror buff.

Ladies and Gents, please understand that the purpose of The Amityville Horror was to generate some cheap scares. The entertaining original had its flaws as well, but was creepy enough to be remembered...not in the category of a Halloween or Exorcist, but in its own little cheap schlocky niche. Fast forward to the remake. 2005 Amityville is fun to watch, and its R rating allows for a few more chills (as opposed to the PG13 garbage that has been released lately). AH2005 isn't a ""thinker"", and it doesn't take you through crazy plot twists....but it does make you jump. Quite a bit. It's campy and has decent acting by Van Wilder and crew.

380,JaredRS80,Bad if you want realism,1,15 April 2005,"I for one was very disappointed in this movie. Don't get me wrong, if this was just a movie written as fiction, it would have been good. But if you like movies that are based on a true story to follow true events, you will be shaking your head.If you have read up on what really happened to the Lutz family, you will see this movie barely followed their story, if at all. They went way overboard, and added way too much, and left out simple things that happened to them, which would have made the movie much creepier. They changed almost the entire story for entertainment sake. And made George Lutz out to be some kind of monster in the process.The bottom line is, if you don't care much as to what really happened to the Lutz family, and just want a good scare, feel free to go see this. But for those of you who have read the true story as told by the Lutz family themselves, save your money and wait for it to come on video.

381,jetski666,Stay at home and boil your head - The result will be much more rewarding!!!,2,24 April 2005,"I saw the movie with my brother last night and we were both left with an overpowering feeling of disgust and despair. The movie must rank as one of the worst movies I have seen ever (with the obvious exception of ""SAW"" that is).I was prepared to leave it at that - but after reading some of these reviews - I have to put the record straight.Saying the remake of ""The Amityville Horror"" is better than the 1979 original is kind of like saying a new Britney Spears song has lyrics with deeper meaning than that of the late great John Lennon.I think that there should be a screening of people who submit these reviews - as I am starting to believe that some of these people either work for the studios or that their not old enough to see the movie in the first place let alone the original.The movie itself seems to have been put together by one of MTV's editors, cutting from one item to another every 5 seconds without even trying to provide any serious level of suspense. Leaving us with 80 odd minutes of rubbish that doesn't even deserve to be screened. The only reason this movie has been screened worldwide is off the back of the cult success of the original.How does the studio have the nerve to put the fatal ""Based on a True Story"" at the start of this movie. Changing elements like Jodie the demonic pig to Jodie the child in the cupboard was hysterical. Why didn't they go the ""whole-hog"" and call this movie GRUDGE 2. I'm sure that the studio was concerned that a demonic pig called Jodie would not have the scare factor of a little girl with a bullet hole in her head - like most of you are probably thinking. Well, all I can say to you is read the book and get an imagination. We don't need to see all this graphical crap, in some of the best horror films of all time - you don't see anything - the suspense is built by good acting and a storyline.Anybody that has seen and enjoyed the original will have detected the religious undertones that are an essential ingredient of any movie in this genre. It provides the ""Good against Evil"" element within the movie. I kid you not, if you go and see this movie, you will be hoping that the house and the present Lutz family disappear into the ground as the ending of the Poltergeist movie.But above all, a massive opportunity was missed with this movie. The story of the real ""Amityville Horror,"" how a spoiled rich kid was possessed by greed and murdered his family in cold blood, and how a financially challenged homeowner disrespectfully used that tragedy to create one of modern history's biggest hoaxes, would make a much more interesting movie than the dreck that is showing in theatres.Is it too much to ask for American studios to use the truth once and a while. People do say that the truth can be stranger than fiction, this statement is certainly true when judging this movie. Millions have been made on the back of this franchise without anybody addressing the facts of the case. Who cares whether the Amityville Horror was a hoax or not - show us the real story and let us decide for ourselves. And if you manage to entertain us at the same time - then you may just have a bonified hit on your hands - rather than another turkey like this remake. I'm certainly not going to waste my money on anymore of this crap.AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS - and if you can't avoid it, take a blindfold and your mp3 player into the study to while away the time. You will thank me for it later.",The Amityville Horror

That granted the film did have some good points the CGI was done with some grace and did not look to stupid apart from one incident involving hornets or bee's or something along them lines.My verdict on the film was that it was OK i thought it was much better than the original, I wouldn't really recommend it to people unless you are stuck in the house with nothing to do and I would never consider buying it, But if your up for a cheap scare or even a fan of the original films then this might be your cup of tea.",The Amityville Horror

""No one dies today!"" before wacking George with a shotgun or whatever the hell she picked up. If I were the Lutz's I would be ticked to be portrayed in this way. After making this movie, poor Ryan Reynolds actually has to keep Blade Trinity and Van Wilder on his resume as his best work to-date. Sorry Ryan, hope things get better for you. Please avoid this movie if you can, and if you did already see it, let me know if you know how to get a hold of the studio so I can demand a refund.",The Amityville Horror
385,elmo112756,Did children make this awful movie?,1,22 April 2005,"Warning contains spoilers!! This was a terrible excuse for a movie. The whole thing was like watching the original on fast forward. Only worse! The acting was on par with high school play's. Ryan Renolds is nice to look at, I guess. Melisa George has a huge upper lip. The scene with Phillip Baker Hall and the fly's made me burst out laughing. The directing was particularly bad, there was not a single scene with any substance. To be honest I don't like Michael Bay films and I probably should have known better. If one must watch a bad horror movie rent ""House of the Dead"" or ""Blade 3"". Both out on video now. So go to Blockbuster and waste $10 there.",The Amityville Horror
386,sassy957,"Excellent, with the exception of a few cheesy moments.",8,12 April 2005,"I gave this such a high rating because it really surpassed my expectations. Since we had free passes, I went in with the mindset of ""I'm getting in for free. It must be terrible."" Honestly, this is one of the scariest movies I've seen. Granted the musical crescendos were overused, the red balloon thing was kind of silly, the use of a small child as a scare tactic is overdone, and the CG flies were badly done. But what movie doesn't have a bit of cheese sprinkled on top? Ryan Reynolds also has surpassed my expectations (in more ways than one.) He's quite excellent. ;-) One thing that makes me EXTREMELY happy is that the movie doesn't have the obligatory shot of a woman's bare chest. (You do, however see a short sex scene with nothing more than a bare back.) Being a girl, I really don't want to see that. It's totally stupid and unnecessary anyway. No boobies=A+ ... I'm not any sort of movie buff, but I know that this film scared the bejeezus out of me and the people I went with. I thought it was great. You don't have to trust my opinion.

387,SlipknoticDisfunctioN,A remake for modern types,3,23 April 2005,"While sitting in the theater, all I could think of was the original film.This remake was undoubtedly for closet freaks and non-movie go'ers. Upon watching this film (if you're a fan of the original), you will realize that nothing from the original will stand out....other than the obvious Amityville clichés. Even though this movie stands out on it's own and DOES provide some good scares of it's own...it does not even begin to compare with the movie others and myself, have come to love.Basically, they've thrown in some of the original 'ideas', and put Hollywood to work on it. Intense cuts (not literal cuts) and sounds make you jump and your heart race...while your mind wanders and thinks; ""Should I have gotten more butter with my popcorn? Maybe I should of grabbed some sno-caps?"" Bottom line: This is a film degraded of it's original state, and stripped of it's integrity that made it a TRUE horror film. Times have changed, and so has directing/acting. The acting is subpar at best, and the clichés make you think of past films.As stated before, while a good scare...still isn't up to the original and not intended for fans of the original. Bring the kids...they will be the only ones screaming ^_^.-=Slip=-",The Amityville Horror
388,sidewalker,Original much better,6,2 May 2005,"This movie wasn't terrible, but I feel it pales in comparison to the original with james brolin and margot kidder. I did like the fact that they touched on the history of the house, but the loud sound effects and ghosts popping out left and right was, in my opinion, a cop out and very similar to every single horror movie I've seen during the past several years. dead children, creepy reflections...been done already (the ring, the grudge, stir of echoes, godsend, sixth sense, hide and seek....etc)what made the original amityville so unique was the constant buildup of suspense and not knowing what was going to happen added more realism and gave the story a psychological dimension....that's scary! also that music with the children chanting still sends chills down my spine. what else - the actor who played the priest couldn't have been any less convincing and a woman who got her hair trapped in the propeller of a boat would not walk away without some type of injury or hair loss. the movie did give me a good scare however and the guy who played Mr. Lutz did a decent job.",The Amityville Horror
389,angelicbuf,Changes from the original,9,30 April 2005,"I loved the movie. Ryan Reynolds was great as George Lutz. Even a little too believable. The only problem I had w/ the movie was that they changed the ending. I was only a little girl when I watched Amityville on t.v. (edited) and I had to look under my bed for months afterwards. But, this movie has the family ridding off in a speed boat @ the end instead of packing up in the van that was parked @ the end of the street only for George to go back for the family dog that was left behind. The poor dog was killed 3/4 of the way through this movie. So, those 2 things that were changed from the original movie I didn't like. The one thing that I don't remember from the first movie was the baby sitter scene. It was comical and scary, but the unnecessary part of this scene was her drug use and the fact that she was barely dressed. Other that those things, I loved the way it was made.

The overall creepiness of this movie is fantastic. Its not one of the scare you to death movies that overkills on the jump scenes(***cough** the grudge) but the parts that are jumpy are also scary as hell, Hello Jody!!! And wait just a minute ladies if you aren't into the horror thing, i believe this movie has appeal. Ryan Reynolds(proud Canadian actor that he is) is into taking roles now where he can flash the old bod and believe me it is so worth looking at. He did the same thing in Blade trinity, I think I see a trend, unfortunately it appears if you want to get noticed in Hollywood all you have to do is take your shirt off. :) aw well none the less it made the movie that much more enjoyable for me. Lucky Alanis.well its a good remake of the original, and i think it'll do well at the box office if the first one is any indication. The whole Indian burial thing is a good addition it makes you jump boy oh boy. And Jody on the ceiling and wow what an ending.

Every scene is filled with something brilliant, you're getting a lot of shocks and the whole movie in itself takes you to a journey through a story, that is actually based on a true one.Usually, I don't quite like remakes of old movies, and The Amityville Horror is a remake of TAH from 1979 with James Brolin and Margot Kidder. This one from 2005 is just much better because they have a lot of new possibilities to take advantage of, e.g. a whole new world of great, useful software-technology.Watch this movie.

To those who are completely ignorant to the story, I highly suggest this film. Hell, I even recommend it to those of you that do know the story. The best part for me was how they had filmed the outside of the house not two miles from my own home. Even parts of the main street in Antioch, WI are shown while George and Kathy are returning from dinner. So, if you haven't seen it as of yet, sit back and relax.

394,guieac,"Very, very...",9,19 October 2005,"Good! I was looking forward to the release of this movie in the theaters, a process that does take a while in Brazil. 'The Amityville Horror' ended up arriving here in August, the 19th to be precise. I was really lucky to get my hands on it on its DVD version as soon as the beginning of October. And boy did I - and still am - enjoying it. I basically watch the best scenes every day and have already watched the 'Making of' three times. The story, which I'm sure everybody knows, whether by watching this or the original (from 1979, starring James Brolin and Margot Kidder), tells the story of the Lutz family, who move into a Dutch-colonial house in Long Island, New York, stage for a series of grisly murders the year before, only to flee 28 days later, claiming to have been disturbed by the evil presences generated from the tragedy. I have simply no words to describe the performances. Melissa George was amazing. It can definitely be compared to Kidder's. It was quite a shock for me since I had never seen any of her work (yes, Alias airs on in here!!!) and let's also give credit to Ryan Reynolds, Rachel Nichols and the kids. I mean, everybody was above the average. The acting in recent horror movies is what's really frightening. But this 'Amityville Horror' is better in every aspect, just as good as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)', another, earlier production of Michael Bay's and Platinum Dunes. It was also written by Scott Kosar, who has an ability to put more action into the remakes, making them much more enjoyable than their originals. WATCH IT.",The Amityville Horror

I was sat on the edge of my seat throughout, screaming at the top of my lungs at all the right moments. The special effects were AMAZING, and not too over the top. However the last half an hour of the flick, you could sit and have a good guess at what was to come, but there are a few unsuspecting twists and turns in the plot.

Ryan Reynolds was amazing in acting out the destruction of his character, as was Melissa George.I just wasn't scared, and the so called ""jumpy bits"" just didn't do it for me.It seemed to me, like a bad carbon copy of The Shining.

397,ritasnothome,terrible,1,25 April 2005,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It shouldn't have been called a remake because it was absolutely nothing like the original. It was also supposedly ""based on the true story"", which is also a lie since the only truth to that story was that George and Kathy were just married, and they just moved into the house. Now tell me, how you can take that and say its based on a true story? This movie was very Hollywood and done up for no real reason. The ending was terrible also. Maybe if it would have had a good ending, i would have had more respect for it. But since it didn't, the movie just plain sucked.

It takes a lot to scare me, and I often leave horror movies happy, but not particularly impressed, excited or terrified. This movie left me with all three feelings as I walked back to my car. I was glad I caught the early show. The acting was great, Ryan Reynolds is a talent hard found, the costuming was impressive, and the scares blew me away. Only two scares were ever used twice (in what is considered to be a movie cliché', and the only one I picked out of the entire film) but were effective. The cinematography was well done, and even though the ending was typical, it was written and acted and shot in a way that gave a new twist to an old idea. This movie was definitely not the ""unoriginal"" reel that some people have labelled it. Everyone was screaming and jumping and covering their eyes, even the manliest men I could spot.I haven't enjoyed myself at the movies this much in a very long time. I don't recommend seeing this movie alone, but if you can kidnap a friend for the evening, I can't imagine anything better to go see.Next up for me? The Skeleton Key.",The Amityville Horror
399,gager_379,Not your average ghost movie,7,16 April 2005,"I recently went out to watch ""The Amityville Horror"" and was not displeased. The opening sequence I believe was brilliantly executed and left the audience uneasy, and unprepared for what the rest of the movie had in store.So, we begin our adventure when a couple (Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George) on the search for a new home, find this beautiful Victorian for a great price. But, as George said himself there's always a catch. AFTER they decide to buy this house the Realtor adds that there was a crime, a murder in the house. Although an uneasy Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) is weary of their decision, she is sure this is the house for them. They all unpack, make a few home movies, and settle into hell...Creepy voices, little girls, and deformed Indians are only a few of the things that end up bothering this typical family. Although this movie used the ""music getting higher"" suspense technique, it did not solely depend on it. This movie gave us a general feeling of terror all the way through, the baby-sitter in the closet sequence was one of many suspenseful and jolted scenes in the movie (you may have known something was coming for her, but not necessarily what). As the story continues on, it does get a bit repetitive at times, until the ending.The ending of this movie was something I was surprised with, it was not over the top, yet it didn't stay above the belt. It hits you where it should, and delivers. Of course we have to deal with our minds asking questions such as ""Why don't you run!!!"" when George is knocked out by Kathy, and ""Why are you taking him with you!"" when they escape. Thankfully, and eventually a few questions are answered before we see them going off into the sunrise. What we are left with is a house, such an important character in the movie, preparing. Preparing for a new family, a new prey, a new victim.This movie did deliver on the scares for the most part, and although it did consist of the horror movie clichés that we have grown tired of, it stands strong and is definitely worth seeing.8/10",The Amityville Horror
400,DMCWriter,Disgusted,1,27 November 2005,"It was 31 years ago this month that Ronald ""Butch"" DeFeo went through his home in Amityville, Long Island, and shot his family in cold blood. His parents, Ronald DeFeo, Sr., and Louise, his brothers, John and Marc, and his sisters, Allison and Dawn. You will notice that none of the children are named ""Jodie."" Keep this in mind the next time you watch THE AMITYVILLE HORROR remake.Actually, that's just ONE of the many things they got wrong.I sat down to watch this movie curious to see what way they have retold this story. But they didn't retell it. They trashed it.Never in my life have I been so disgruntled as a movie viewer. You see, I can't watch movies as an average moviegoer; I watch them as a writer. And, as a writer, I think that if you are going to write a story that is ""based on a TRUE story,"" you gotta get things right! You gotta get your facts straight! The more appropriate term for this movie is ""based on actual events."" That's Hollywood code for ""this basically happened but we changed it a bit."" Instead, they say it was based on a true story! Saying that means the movie strove to be as ACCURATE as possible. But it wasn't.First of all, NONE of the DeFeo children climbed out of bed and hid in the closet while Ronnie was shooting up the place. ALL of them were murdered in their beds. NONE of them, strange as this may be, heard him shooting. (This is based on police reports and historical records. The neighbors didn't even hear him shooting.) Only one of the daughters awakened during the rampage and tried to block the barrel Ronnie had pointed at her; she was STILL shot in her bed.Next, we see the Lutzes moving in. Guess what? They hadn't been told of the house's history prior to taking up residence. (I saw the real estate agent telling the story and I thought, 'Yeah, right. Like THAT would happen.') Scratch that from the movie. Now nowhere in this movie do we see George getting up at 3:15 a.m. to check the boathouse, as the real-life George Lutz did, like clockwork, at 3:15 a.m. Instead, he sees a child hanging from the rafters. Okay, where did THAT come from? None of the children had hung themselves. Sheesh! Moving on. There's no sounds of a marching band keeping George awake, no nun getting sick upon entering the home, none of Kathy and George's friends freaking out over the place, no lion moving all by itself in the living room, no red eyes in the window that Kathy sees and no image of a demonic pig in the upstairs window that George sees. (Actually, he DOES see Jodie ... the DEFEO child that didn't exist).You know, they often say that truth is stranger than fiction. This is so true. I read THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and saw all the movies. I've gone over articles, reports and message board postings. The things I read scared the you-know-what out of me, compared to the so-so reaction I had with the original movie and the disgust over the remake.If the writers, producers and directors wanted this baby to be accurate, why didn't they embellish ACTUAL events?? How about when Harry accidentally hung himself when trying to escape on the first day the family moved in? (He lived but he'd been seriously spooked.) How come we didn't get to see Kathy levitating off of her bed or George seeing a hooded ghostly figure on the steps pointing at him? Something could've been done leading to George discovering hoof prints running away from his living room window in the snowy ground outside or what about how Kathy and her children were running through the house, screaming as SOMETHING chased after them, while George remained paralyzed and oblivious in his bed? We don't get to see the front screen flying off its hinges. (FYI: It was the SCREEN door, not the front door.) We don't see the blood coming out of the walls or the goo clogging up the toilets. And WHERE was the red room in the basement?? The writers decided to fabricate some story of a torture chamber to explain away the house's morbid disposition, but the fact that a ""red room"" existed seems to be egregiously overlooked. When the George in the new movie started pounding away at the wall, I thought, 'Well, FINALLY, we see the red room.' But, ah, that didn't happen. Sorry, folks, but George ends up taking a trip in La-La Land to find out the house's sordid past.OK. It's a movie. I'll grant you that much. But the movie is SUPPOSEDLY a true story. My question is, where is the truth? Where is the stuff that REALLY happened? We see a priest there to bless the house. Okay, that much is true. We see a voice telling him ""get out."" But the stream of flies knocking him down off a stool?? C'mon!! I guess they decided to take the priest being slapped and turn it into a priest hitting the ground because of an army of flies knocking him off the stool.Oh, and George didn't kill the dog with an ax. Scratch that, too.Hollywood was a little bit too Hollywood with this one. When I read about the real-life George Lutz suing the team involved with this movie, claiming it portrayed him and his family wrong, I was skeptical. Hadn't seen the movie yet so I didn't know what to think. Now that I HAVE seen it, I can understand why. If I was George Lutz, I'd sue them, too.",The Amityville Horror
401,kingmalice14,"""Amityville Horror"" Remake - Worth 50 Cents?",1,15 June 2005,"*There MAY be spoilers, although you will probably thank me for the one's I point out*For those of you who haven't seen the original?Do not see this movie.For those of you who have?For the love of God, stay away from this movie!Now, I've only seen about 80% of the original Amityville, with chunks missing from the middle, but I think I can safely say - the original was better than this train wreck in every way:1) The new Amityville is not a horror movieThis requires a bit of explanation - the remake is not a scary movie; it is an occasionally surprising movie. Sure, there are dead people, ghosts, blood, etc, but it's nothing horrific, per se. Hell, how hard is it to scare somebody when they're sitting in the dark staring at a 40-ft lighted screen and surrounded be loudspeakers? If I were watching a movie about puppies and you suddenly shifted the screen to a picture of kittens, but played a really loud 'scary' sound effect, I'd probably sh*t my pants.2) The term 'Remake' is very loosely impliedIt would have required a lot less time and energy just to make a new film, instead of butchering the original plot to make room for more ""BOO!"" moments. Whereas the original showed the father, George, slowly coming under the influence of the house, it seems that after stepping foot in this new version of the house, George goes completely psycho. Within a week he's yelling at his stepchildren and bitching at his wife. Oh yes the house... now, like I said, I didn't see ALL of the original, but I'm pretty sure I don't remember the part where the spirit of an evil Quaker Oats guy, who tortured Native Americans and then committed suicide, was the cause of all the trouble. Again, maybe that's just me. (Also, did I miss the part with the crazy ass, pot-smoking babysitter in the original? I don't know!)3) The DogIn the remake, they find it necessary to have George axes the hell out of the family dog, and then show it's mangled corpse. In the original, I seem to remember George running back into the house after his family escapes just to save this dog! Now, one may seem sappy, but the other one involves a mangled dog corpse, so you can see which one I prefer.4) The Softcore Sex SceneThe softcore sex scene between George and his wife, Kathy (played by the surprisingly hot Melissa George), it starts out with so much promise! She disrobes and mounts her husband, which is followed by a minute and a half of implied humping where you get a great view of her back from the waist up. So far so good. And then... *BAM* Dead girl being hanged. My reaction? ""JESUS! What the f*ck?! God damnit! That's... God DAMNIT!"" And so on, so forth. Definitely one of the movie's most startling moments, but also it's most brutally disappointing. You expect a treat, and you get sucker punched right in the family jewels.I could go on, but I think by now you've got the picture. Having seen this movie at the dollar theater, where I got a half-off discount because it was Tuesday, I can safely say that I feel grossly overcharged for having wasted my time on such a blatantly bad movie.",The Amityville Horror

I also found it amusing at how random times, Mr psycho would start screaming for no reason concievable to me. I liked this one, sure, but the original blows it away.

403,daniel_alexander_pritcha,Beyond Boring,1,19 April 2005,"This is an awful remake. It is not scary, it is badly acted, the story is dumbed down, in fact it really isn't anything more than a collection of ideas gathered from other horror films.I really expected this to be a lot better, the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was rather well done, and since this film shared the same production team I had decent expectations.The original film thrived on an air of menace, atmosphere and psychological horror. The remake simply takes the fear of everything that was left to the imagination originally and shoves it into your face without style or scares.The incredible shortness of the film (80 minutes or so with credits) skims days in a ridiculous fashion jumping from day 1 to day 15 in a flash, therefore killing the build up of events. The character development is terrible, you are given such little time to get to know any of the cast that you really just couldn't care what happens to any of them. The Priest/Church aspect of the film, which was very important to the original story is shoved in later on as an almost after thought.The babysitter scene is absolutely dreadful. It's like a deleted scene from Scary Movie. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George both look terribly out of place and young for the roles they are playing. Besides Ryan Reynolds really isn't very good at playing nuts, he seems to have just watched The Shining and play acted the rest.Don't waste your money or your valuable time on this film.

Mmmm-Hmmm. Sure. Well, I watched with an open mind (I always do when it comes to horror movies - and yet I still end up hating them more or less) and was shocked that I found myself jumping on more than one occasion. I have recently been on an Asian Horror kick, and the difference between those films and American released films are that the ones made overseas are made with a kind of passion, for lack of a better word. The updated Amityville Horror was a scary, uneasy movie that actually had a good story, solid acting, and some gore. What every horror movie should contain. I did have a couple of problems. SPOILERS Knowing the true story the movie is based upon, the family that was murdered were all found face down when they were shot. This is very interesting information when you consider that 6 (?) people were shot at different times, and not one of them appeared to be hiding from the murderer. Rather, they roll over on their tummy and take their medicine? Interesting. I would have liked to see that explained in some manner. It wasn't. Also, I didn't find myself sympathizing with the family like I should have. I wasn't rooting for George to whack his entire family, mind you, but I would have liked to root for mom and kids to get away. Really didn't.

The sounds and sights were very frightening (especially that poor kid getting up to pee and the thing behind him-how traumatizing). By comparison, we've come along way since the days that the horror movie genre had to depend on sound tech for the scary effects of a film. The 2005 version, has been anticipated for years because there was so much creativity in the story. Now it can be brought to life on film.

Well lets see, oh yes, lets start with the original which first of all was just under 2 hours long and compare it to the measly hour and a half of the remake. The story of the original had absolutely no resemblance to the remake which may I add was a good thing since it worked so well for the '04 remake of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" although it did have its similar scenes. In my opinion for those who care, and you should because I am a die-hard horror movie fan, this movie was more of a re-in-visioning rather than a remake. If your still reading and haven't gotten bored yet, the movie also has its shares of action scenes. The last thing I would want to do is recommend a bad movie, so take it from me, this movie is for those who love unexpected moments and scares. Spoiler: By the way if you don't enjoy watching children and animals being killed don't go see this movie, various scenes in the film depict children getting shot with shot guns and the dog getting murdered with an axe, so basically not for the weak of heart. Overall the movie received a 9/10 stars from me it would have received more if it would have gone more in dept to the history of the house and not so much as to all of the mutilation that was going on.",The Amityville Horror
409,nyrockchick,I jumped a few times!,8,22 April 2005,"Let me first say that I'm a little ""jaded"" with regards to horror flicks. Tons of gore doesn't do it for me...give me suspense. Well, that's pretty much what this movie did...I was pleasantly surprised! The beginning of the movie showed the original murders..nice! I like seeing that, not just ""people were murdered here"" & then it's flashback city. I was surprised that a couple from Deer Park (relatively close to Amityville) wouldn't have heard of the murders just 1 year before..but I digress. The movie moved at a nice pace...kept me interested. I like the story of an somewhat older couple..not just ""teens getting slashed""..makes it way more believable. I jumped at the bathroom scene. Was mad at the ""dog"" scene. Laughed at the wood chopping scene with his son holding the wood (just when he grabbed his face). Ryan played a great psycho, I must say..nice ""ab scenery"" also! There are the typical questions...like ""if a Priest runs out of your house, you'd still sleep there""? All in all, a definite future DVD purchase!",The Amityville Horror
410,ercrosswhite,Good movie especially for a horror flick,9,25 April 2005,"Overall I liked it! It was exciting when need be and it made since in a imaginative realistic way if u get me. Most importantly Ryan Reynolds did an awesome job. I thought he wasn't good enough for serious stuff but I was wrong. He did a good job of transforming from the nice everyday guy into the viscous phsyco killer. Now it wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen but the combination of excitement and acting just did it for me. It was a very good remake. Dare I say it was even better than the first. Well thought out it gave tremendous catchy lines if u look for them. The house was a tremendous set also it really added to the affect. Well done for the set designers. I recommend it be seen at least twice. In my opinion, and u have the right to disagree, I think it goes down in the books. The whole theme of the movie just built up for it. Everyone knowing the history of the movie and wanting to see if it was better just added to it. If you didn't like it the first time you should give it another chance. I'm not a huge horror movie fan but this is now one of my favorites.",The Amityville Horror
411,Twinster983,True Story??? NOT!!!,8,26 April 2005,"The only things that even closely resemble the original Amityville horror book to this 2005 remake of the 1979 movie are the fact that George Lutz goes berserk, and the house has two really spooky looking pie shaped windows!!! Otherwise this movie is very much ""Based"" on a true story. But keep in mind that the Lutzes have since, admitted that the whole haunted house thing was a hoax. But don't let this sway you from going to see this extremely spooky, highly entertaining movie. The original Amityville movie with Kidder/Brolin did try to stay more true to the book, it was a pretty good movie, but wasn't terribly scary (Unless you factor in Brolins overacting) ""Amityville 05"" doesn't go for the ""true story"" aspect, it just tries to scare the heck out of you, and does a darn good job of it...As a fan of the books and movies about Amityville, I walked into the theater totally expecting for the movie to suck...It proved me wrong within 15 minutes. I liked it so much, I saw it twice...I never go to the theater twice, but ""Amityville 05"" is just one of those movies you have to see on the big screen...If I were to have one thing negative to say about this movie, it's the fact that all of the DeFeo children were killed in their beds. (Not in closets) And Jody wasn't the name of a child, it was an imaginary friend that manifested as a pig to the Lutzes daughter...The Jody character in ""05"" does add a new air of creepies to the movie, but the pig could've added a nice twist as well...I read ""The Amityville Horror"" twice back in the 70's, as well as ""Amityville...Horror or Hoax"" by Dr. Stephen Kaplan. I also read ""High Hopes the story of the Amityville murders"" by Gerard Sullivan and Harvey Aronson. I highly recommend these books if you love the movie, and get the newly released ""Amityville Collection"" box set DVD. Not so much for the movies (Amityvile 1-2 and 3) but for the 2 History channel documentaries included in the box. They are excellent and cover the whole Amityville story to a tee...",The Amityville Horror
412,camandsoph,Amazingly bad,1,27 April 2005,"Like most recent films of the genre this is utter ****. I think the script for the entire film is probably around 5 pages - as usual its just shallow characters creeping around with unfrightening things popping out at predictable moments. And lets not forget the obligatory 'little girl ghost' that you see in every film like this - she raises her ugly head once too often. I'm serious... avoid this film. Why people wasted time making this, is the scariest thing about it.

I am usually a pretty hard person to shake and it usually takes a lot for a movie to frighten me, however this one greatly succeeded!! I was jumping in my chair and holding tight the whole time. I have never seen the first one, however by the looks of it I can guess that it is also full of teeth-chattering scares. I thought that the actors did an excellent job portraying their characters. I thought Ryan Renoylds did a fantastic job playing the villain instead of the humorous character, even though he does both very well. I thought there were great techniques used as far as cinematography and directorial! It was scary, interesting and fun all at the same time. A well spent hour and twenty minutes.

415,dawn14847,"A rare, decent horror!",7,10 May 2005,"Due to the popularity of the original film, a remake was always going to be quite a difficult task, but thankfully the cast and crew have successfully managed to pull it off. Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George, although initially seemed an unlikely choice, get through the film with charm and grace, their performances more than making up for the fact that they are a little to young for the roles of the mother and the father, although every so often you are reminded of this. Myself being a big fan of the original, it contained enough to keep me satisified with little in-jokes and reminders of the original, such as certain props and furniture, but the storyline was changed enough that it kept me entertained and surprised throughout. I'm also a big Ryan Reynolds fan, so it was great to see him in a more serious role, that he thankfully managed to pull off.All in all, a great film that I would certainly see again.",The Amityville Horror

This new version, unfortunately, isn't. It uses every cliché under the sun. It does make you jump but it makes you jump that many times that you don't know what you were jumping about at the end of the movie.This film is OK and is watchable. I am sure that the makers would have preferred to have made a film that at least people would discuss. If this film was a colour it would be grey. If it was weather it would be mild.Great films leave you with many unanswered questions. This film left me with one. This question is WHY?",The Amityville Horror
418,toshiko79,Certainly Not the Amityville Horror! A Host Of Lies And Disappointment!,1,21 March 2006,"I bought The Amityville Horror DVD box that released just before the 2005 film. Inside was a free movie pass. I'm a fan of the Amityville franchise. The first 2 films, anyway. I've also read the book and am familiar with the entire Amityville legend. Fact or fiction, its all very interesting. After watching the trailer I was excited about a new Amity rendition. Even if it was just another Hollywood remake of a classic horror film. I think someone already said this, but after seeing the remake for free, I WANTED MY MONEY BACK! At the end, my friend and I looked at each other in disbelief. ""WTF?!,"" we yelled. According to producer Michael Bay, we thought we were getting a film quote ""follows the book more accurately than the original film."" BULLSH*T!!! Utter lies! What we got instead was a movie bearing no relation to the actual story other than capitalizing on the title. A movie devoid of anything. Ultimately, one of the worst horror films we had ever seen. No, one of the worst excuses for a film. Period. Michael Bay has the nerve to proclaim this movie was more like the book than the original? He can't be serious. The debate over the Lutz's story continues to this day, but whether or not its true doesn't permit you to change the story completely, have the audacity to say its based more on the book, AND still call it a ""true story."" I challenge anyone to read Jay Anson's book, ""The Amityville Horror."" Regardless of whether you believe it or not, go back and watch the remake. The original 1979 film may also be a farce, but at least it tried to follow the book, and was a MUCH closer account of what actually happened. If anything, the 2005 remake is the opposite of what happens in the book. It bears no semblance to the story it claims to be based on whatsoever. Watch the promo on the Bonus DVD with the Amity box set. Michael Bay insists this is a more book-accurate depiction than the original film. This statement is a lie. After saying this, they try to exploit the fact Ronny DeFeo Jr. killed his entire family with a high-powered rifle and no one heard a single shot. The filmmakers stressed this greatly to propel the mystery surrounding the event. Then, in what was an act of pure stupidity, they completely contradict themselves by showing the FICTIONAL ""Jodie DeFeo,"" being awoken by THE FIRST SHOT! Let's do a little film-to-book comparison (which makes the filmmakers look like dumb asses). Jodi DeFeo never existed. The DeFeo family had 2 real daughters, Dawn and Allison. Her character was an attempt to deceive the audience for cheap scares. Jodie in the book and the 1979 film was the imaginary friend of Missy, a demonic pig who terrorized the Lutzes. In the remake, the Priest arrives near the end AFTER Kathy supposedly learns about John Ketchum. Ketchum, whose existence was never proved, practiced witchcraft and devil worship. He DID NOT torture native Indians with chains and other devices Hellraiser style. In the book, Fr. Mancuso (Fr. Delaney in the 1979 film, another alter-ego of the real priest, Fr. Ray) visits the house on the day the Lutz's move in. Being a family friend, he comes to bless the house when he experiences the horror himself, being told to ""GET OUT!!!"" This occurs in the book as well and the 1979 original film in the factual order. I went to see this movie just to hear the house say ""get out!"" Even that was barely audible over the ridiculous eruption CGI flies. That scene alone proved the entire film nothing more than absurd, over-the-top Hollywood theatrics. There was no Jodie DeFeo. There was no cross on the doorknobs that obviously inverted every time you opened a door. George did not kill Harry the dog. He did not revert to a maniacal killer bent on offing his family a la ""The Shining."" 112 Ocean Avenue did not look like Castle Dracula. NONE of the events in the remake occurred in the book, and the few similarities that did weren't even in sequential order. Since the book is the only source material to account for what may or may not have happened, it's the only telling that can be drawn from. In defense of the original movie, though it too was a not entirely accurate exaggeration, at least it followed the book fairly true. For the most part, everything in the film was in the book. If you're going to remake a movie, at least do your homework and follow the actual story. And if your going to dare claim your movie follows the book more closely, it damn well better. And not be composed of utter lies and non-sense. Otherwise, don't call it a ""remake"" because it isn't. Call it something else. The 2005 film was utterly terrible. Even by horror movie standards. I cannot say enough bad things about it. The score was mediocre and forgettable, nothing like Lalo Schiffrin's 1979 score. The cinematography was ridiculous with all the flashy lightning and outlandish visuals. Even the house was a perverse, overly sinister incarnation. Everything about this movie was irrelevant Hollywood overkill. Anyone frightened by this must be under 7 and shouldn't have been admitted without a parent. The sad thing is the Amityville story, real or not, is unique and compelling. The filmmakers had so much rich history and material to work with. This could have been a terrific re-interpretation. Instead, it failed miserably. It had none of the presence of the original and had little if anything to do with the real story. Change the tag line to ""For God's Sake, Ryan Reynolds, Put A Goddamn Shirt On!"" If you're a fan of the original, of horror movies, or just good movies in general, avoid ""The Amityville Horror"" remake at all costs.",The Amityville Horror

Very nice effects, made on the right place and with the right intensity to produce the wanted effect. Very good camera and light work on this movie!

420,krikorg-27271,Garbage film.,1,2 October 2017,"If you're going to make a horror film, make it horrifying - not aggravating. The acting was more horrifying than the actual movie. Couldn't take any of it seriously. I couldn't get scared even though I turned the lights off, blasted the volume and sat up close to the TV. The plot is silly. No thought was put into it. They also added A LOT of random details to the actual house's history instead of building on the existing history, which made it even sadder. This movie, like most stupid and offensive paranormal horror films, has the same exact plot: atheism gets someone into trouble and when Christianity tries to solve it, the priest is always too faithless and weak to help. Thus, a woman must save the day because women are better than men. We get it, Hollywood. Anyway, this is not worth the 1 hour and 30 minutes of your life.",The Amityville Horror

The writing is bad. The acting is bad. Hercules, I mean Ryan Reynolds, gives the worst impersonation of Jack Nicholson in the shining that has ever been committed to celluloid. All the moments that are intended to frighten are just thrown at you and not effectively built up. No suspense. Another problem with this movie is that every single shot is on a dolly. Every ""emotional"" moment is accentuated by zooming in or out. There is not one horror cliché that is not utilized. From the girl that talks to dead people to the priest that warns that this family must leave the unholy place. I've read better student screenplays.",The Amityville Horror

Ghosts are pestering the kids, the husband is being taken over by ghosts, the wife doesn't notice anything until the movie is almost over, the husband wants to kill his family and in the end they leave the house.If i'm wrong, correct me.

425,assadofgrey,I made an imdb account just to tell you to stay away from this awful POS,1,16 July 2019,"You liked the shining? You liked insidious? How about Sinister? Conjuring? Session 9? Blair witch? The Ritual? The Canal? Babadook? (I could give you at least 20 other actual real horror movies to watch instead of this, I mean seriously just PM me if that's what it'll take for you to not watch this)
Now onto the review, or basically how I'm going to talk about how the story makes no sense. If you're like me who watches real horror movies and doesn't rate dribble like this a 9/10 (seriously who are you people? It's not hard to find real horror), you will SCREAM at how just stupid and avoidable anything and everything is in this. Yeah it's a movie, sometimes things have to be unbelievable to move the story forward, but everything is unbelievable, for me it becomes unwatchable.Regrettably I did finish the movie since I was going to go to sleep right after, so I figured yeah whatever I'll finish it. Let's start from the beginning of the movie and how the entire movie could have been avoided if instead of the brainless wife and husband didn't buy the house the same day they looked at it, or at least that's how its portrayed in the movie. Who buys or decides to buy a house the same day? Unless you have a lot of money so you can pick what you want, and in this story the couple keep saying how they just gotta buy this house since its so gosh darn affordable since they had no money for some giant house, so they def ain't rich. Yo everyone in life learns this, if a deal is too good to be true, you run from the deal.What if the house wasn't lowered in price because a family was murdered there? How about if like, the pipes are garbage rusted underground and have a chance to burst every winter so you gotta pay the $$$ to repair them, but of course the realtor isn't gonna say that. Would they take the house anyway? Yeah we don't have a lot of money so lets risk it on a house that's priced at half of the same houses in the same area, we're just so smart!So instead of being responsible parents and taking at least 1 day to do research on the house and exactly what happened to the previous owners, they buy it same day (I mean christ it's been on the market for what a year at this point so I'm pretty sure they could have haggled the price down). Alright, yeah, whatever, guess a movie had to be made. Let's talk about the babysitter that gets introduced for a couple of scenes. It's not that she's a bad actor or anything like that, it's that the tv producers or whoever decides what the characters should wear, made her look like she walks the street. This tank top thing half bra, blue bright eye makeup, the pink lipstick, and she keeps making the 12 year old shes babysitting by going right to his bed, to eventually tell him about the story of the previous family and how they died (and you know she's gonna at the very least get fired for that, but every adult in this movie is missing a brain so it's just normal). Who goes to any babysitting job dressed like that? I actually believe this character prefers the company of minors, what is this movie...So half way through weird stuff begins to happen, normal stuff like the little girl almost getting tricked into falling to her death by the dead girl from the previous family murders. I actually did like that scene, it was unique honestly and done pretty well. Now back to screaming at the movie again. 1 hour into the movie a priest from the church pays the house a visit to see what's going on and he tries to do some basic priest stuff to see if he can get the demon out, a bunch of bugs attack him and he runs away, then drives away. Now this would tell a normal person like the wife, as the husband is possessed at this point, to take your kids, right now if you can, and leave. If your husband tries to come after you, kill him because that's self defense at that point. The entire town will understand if the wife kills the husband after the last family.So of course she does nothing because she's useless like everyone in this movie. I mean it's not like her daughter tried to off herself because a dead girl tried to convince her to do it right? So she goes back to the priest, he tells her to finally get out of the house, so now she's going back to try to save her family (spoiler everyone lives).Now this is the very end where the family is safe on the speedboat. The wife and kids had to tie the husband up and drag him onto the boat, plan is to then just drive away and get as far from the house as possible so the husband stops trying to kill them to get away from the Indian burial ground under the house. Alright cool right? Why does she take the husband onto the boat with the kids? Leave him there on the plank, drive kids down to a nearby shore, and come back for him. Why are you risking your entire family's lives over a guy who isn't the biological father? Stupid woman, stupid husband, I feel bad for the kids, and one useless priest who's afraid of bugs.Oh and yeah this movie isn't scary, stop trying to convince yourself it is to the people who rate it 8/10 or higher.",The Amityville Horror

I say this for 2 reasons: 1) Although Ryan Reynolds was hilarious in VAN WILDER, i just could not picture him doing horror 2) The last movie in the AMITYVILLE series went straight to video and resurrected and re-killed the franchise.But as with most movies, the trailer looked promising so i decided to give the film a benefit of a doubt, but i was not prepared for the roller-coaster ride that the film truly is. The film starts off with Ronny Defoe (or however you spell it) brutally murdering his family, claiming to have heard voices coming from within the house telling him to do so. Then one year later the klutz family move into the house....if you have seen the original you can guess the rest of the movie from there.In my opinion, this is one of the few remakes that is way better than the original that inspired it.

It delivers some good scares, and there is more to it then just the house being evil. If you watch it closely you will notice the ghost who walks around in the movie. He has a black hat and wears all black, he is in a few scenes and is relevant to the story. watch it again, and its much better than the original.... the one thing i wish the remake had, were the bleeding walls. that would have been classic. As well the acting was decent. People and critics have to realize not every movie is made for Oscar nominations, just look at it for entertainment. I'm recommending this because it offers more scares than the grudge, the ring, and house of wax combined.",The Amityville Horror
437,stuhrLassen,what a piece of empty crap,2,24 April 2005,"What a piece of empty crap. This is just another assembly line type of ""scary movie"" with no personality whatsoever. The kind of horror movie where you just cant get why the female main character stays with her clearly insane and dangerous husband, just long enough for him to almost kill off the entire family. If the characters have had a little more than five minutes to develop before we where bombarded with more or less meaningless shockeffects, the little girl on a chair witch no one but the daughter can see etc, some good might come out of this. But as it is. This movie is trying to disguise the fact that the director have lost control of the story with a nice trendy colourgrading and some snappy editing. To be fair Ryan Reynolds delivers a somewhat convincing maniac. Too bad the part where he turns from loving husband into murderer has obviously gone missing.",The Amityville Horror
438,makeashaantface,A family is haunted by the events of centuries past and the murders of a family.,7,26 January 2009,"Reading the previous comments, I can see the aggravation with this rendition of the Amityville Horror being quite stretched. There was actually a family that lived in Amytiville on LI, and my grandparents were friends of the parents. The oldest son did murder his family, but over a family feud, not from demonic possession, he was just sick. A family did move in to the house a short time after the murders and wrote a book about the ""haunting"" of the house. The author later confessed there were no ghosts or demons, they got drunk and made up stories after learning of the murders in their house. So in the end, the whole ""true story"" is stretched in the book as well, and saying that these events may have actually happened is a good seller. The movie was enjoyable as far as horror flicks go, and I was impressed by all the actors. Pretty nice job.",The Amityville Horror

It had everything Horror, suspense, drama, hot women e.g.the babysitter, gore, everything you want in a horror movie you get here. Don't believe the reviews. Not only is it the scariest it might be one of the best acted horror films. Especially funny man Ryan Renyolds who gives the best nice guy turned phsyco since Nicholson. From the very first frame to the very last you will be terrified. I could keep going but I wont because you should be in the car going and seeing this horror masterpiece. That surpasses the original in so many ways I've lost count.

440,yodda_girl-1,So Scary,10,24 June 2005,"This movie was so scary I couldn't even sleep that night! It was so awesome, I loved the movie so much! The entire cast was so excellent in the movie! They stayed very true to the real Lutz family and the original cast of Amityville Horror. I was so terrified after I saw the movie. This movie had more of the things that happened to the Lutz family then the original movie. I think it might be better than the original!!! I know a lot about the Amityville Horror and this was pretty factual. When I went to Amityville Horror, a few people actually left the theater! I went to this movie twice and it still scared the crap out of me!!! Prepare your self for the truth!",The Amityville Horror
441,TheLoneSoldier,The first actual scary movie in years....awesome.,8,16 April 2005,"Let me just list a few films that have come out in the last few years..The Ring. The Grudge. Saw. Cabin Fever. Creep.What do all these movies have in common...They were all referred to in some way, shape or form to be ""One of the scariest films in years"". Not so, each one of the listed let me down totally, I'm not a fan of this new 'edgy' visual style, such as dirty sets used to evoke a uneasy feeling, or the use of poor quality visuals (such as CCTV or bad video tapes) that are supposed to do the same. It just doesn't work for me. Also, not one of the films listed above had me caring for the protagonist. I don't care about a French/German cow with a bad-attitude stuck in an Underground tube station, I don't care about a bad actor who wakes up in a dirty bath and doesn't remember what happened to him...the same goes for a reporter (or whatever Naomi Watts was) and quite simply Sarah Michelle Gellar...I really don't care for her.But this is where Amityville differs, Ryan Reynolds is SUPERB and that is no exaggeration, he shines as a surrogate father to three children, he is warm and funny and obviously a caring family man. The same for Melissa George, who appears a slight too young to be a widow with three children but still, acted wonderfully..until the last ten minutes, when there are some really quite cheesy lines uttered right in the middle of the terror - which really takes the edge off.Anyway, I digress, The scares kick in almost immediately, with a graphic depiction of the actual DeFeo family murders, which truly seem terrifying, as all the while you have in the back of your mind, ""This really happened to a poor family"". The visual style in this scene adds to the tension as it is unlike anything I have seen before, it all looks like a nightmare...thus setting the tone for the rest of the film, but these prove to be least scary moments and for the rest of the film you almost wish it was ALL as easy as the first ten minutes.From 'day 1' the unease is felt, not only by the Lutz family, but by you. The Lutz family don't seem to notice every creek and groan the house makes, be you certainly do. It's all harder to watch (maybe because this a remake and based on a true story, I use BASED lightly) because the viewer is always thinking ""Please, For god's sake get out!"" - See what I did there?There are some truly horrific moments which will stick with me for a long time, such as the bathroom ghost and the girl on the ceiling. I'm a big Yorkshire lad and let me just say, I had a hard time sleeping, not at first...I dozed off instantly, but strangely at 3:15am, sorry had to be done, I awoke and my eyes were bloodshot. Again, I digress.Any teenage lads wanting some pretty flesh this film doesn't disappoint, look out for the babysitter, what a hotty, but what a b*tch, she deserves everything she get's ladies and gentlemen. One of the strangest effects of the movie, for me anyway, was the fact that...even though you could see our man George turning into a stone-cold killer and his family was in great danger, for the first half hour or so of his demise, he seemed more like a bad-ass anti-hero, maybe a mistake of the film makers, but to me it just added to the emotion when he finally turned.This film does some amazing things with the original story, and delves deeper into a darker and more sinister sub story, sort of a cross between Poltergeist and Thirteen Ghosts when you finally go into the basement/dungeon. The only let down I can gather, is that fans of the original film waiting to see a large Pig with red eyes that walks like man, are instead greeted with (unfortunately this is where the movie conforms to the trends set by todays shite) a long black-haired girl with a passion for scaring everyone who enters the house where she was murdered...You could say she had a 'grudge' against them.The Amityville Horror is a fast paced, and raw bag of nerves. This is a fine horror film, classy and stylized but with parts of pure sickness and grit. I would advise anyone to go see this, especially fans of the original. **** of 5.",The Amityville Horror
442,dewzi,good fun horror,10,16 April 2005,"My advice: Don't see the 1979 version first, don't think about it too hard, pretend it's not based on the ""true story"", and just enjoy this great horror film. It may not be a timeless classic, but its fun. The thing I liked best about this one is that everything makes sense. There's no cliffhangers or overly complicated mystery that never gets explained. It's just 89 minutes of very frightening ghosts popping up and some surprisingly appropriate acting. In fact, I would say this movie has one of the most petrifying ghost scenes ever.(The boy in the bathroom!)The costumes/makeup were really good too. Also, I loved Ryan Reynolds in a scary movie. I thought his quirky style was a perfect complement to the cast. He makes a smooth transition from Van Wilder to Blade 3 to Amityville because he seems to just be himself.",The Amityville Horror
443,dudes2003,"Original is better, but still really good!",7,2 September 2005,"This movie is really confusing when you watch it for the first time. But the 1979 version seems more effective. This is really scary though, not like the 1979 version where you get no chills. Ryan Reynolds was terrific, Melissa George was also. All the actors did an excellent job. This has to be one of the scariest movies of 2005, and its based on a true story which is even better. Everyone should check out Amityville 2: The Possession which came out in 1982. This took place before Amityville Horror (1979) when the killings took place. Also check out Amityville 3-D. A reporter for a magazines, catch the people living there at the present time playing a hoax, and making it look like the house is haunted, and later moves in. Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes takes place when no one currently lives in the Amityville house, and the evil is transported through a huge, ugly lamp to a home in California. There are 4 more i have yet to watch. Please enjoy the Amityville series.",The Amityville Horror
444,brent_hankins,On the fence,7,16 April 2005,"If you completely ignore anything and everything that has to do with the Amityville stories, then this is a pretty decent horror flick. Ryan Reynolds turns in a very effective performance, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining."" By the end of the flick, i was scared of the dude. The rest of the cast was solid, as well. Lots of scares throughout the film, but a little too much of the ""MTV style"" editing, especially in the last fifteen minutes or so. But all in all, a decent effort, just like i said.HOWEVER.If you're going into this expecting any resemblance WHATSOEVER to the book, the original film, or any of the stories told over the years, you're going to be severely disappointed. The filmmakers have pretty much left out the events that transpired in the novel and the previous film, and instead they take an extreme amount of liberty with the story and turn it into a series of stylized Hollywood scare tactics. Don't get me wrong, this is still effective, but if you're going to release a movie and promote it as ""Based on the True Story"" then you might wanna make sure that the movie at least RESEMBLES the original story.In fact, George Lutz is currently in litigation with MGM films over the content of the movie, claiming that it shows his family in a potentially damaging light. When you see the flick, you'll understand why he's upset. I can't fault the guy.If they had left the Amityville name off of this one and just released it as some generic haunted house movie, then i wouldn't have so many issues with it. But to even associate it with anything Amityville-related just seems wrong to me, because they have completely screwed it up. I would still recommend the film, and just caution potential viewers to forget everything you've ever seen or heard about Amityville. Otherwise you'll walk out of that theater just as annoyed as i was.",The Amityville Horror

I work for a radio station that just put together a 3 hour program about the Amityville saga that includes interviews with George Lutz, Tracey Defeo, The Warrens and the list goes on and on. Against their advice I went to see this movie anyway. The list of what is wrong with this remake is to long to mention but if you choose the complete list is posted at amityvillehorror.com. The first movie, although that to was very Hollywood, scared the crap out of me. In fact I still consider it the scariest movie I have ever seen. The remake had not one scary moment. I guess for the teeny-bopper crowd this is a new story and for them it might be enjoyable, I suggest these people read the original book or rent the original movie. It's no wonder Mr. Lutz is suing MGM!!!!",The Amityville Horror
446,rdsxlolo,Awful,2,6 May 2005,"This movie was so terrible. No wonder why the original family is so upset, their story was completely falsified. True, the original wasn't scary, just creepy, but this is because it was based on a true story, and for once Hollywood didn't overdramatize it too much. That all changed with this version, it was completely ridiculous. Ryan Reynolds was hot as usual though, and the only good part of the movie. He plays a good psycho, but should have waited for a better movie to bring out his talents. At least you get to see him with his shirt off a lot. :o) Too bad that they had to go and ruin the story. The original family tried so hard to stop this movie, and it is now obvious why.

Good movie to see with a group of friends or with your significant other, someone that you can grab on to! Ryan Reynolds was SO FREAKIN RIPPED in this movie, by far the hottest I've ever seen him!

449,paranoidxe,Good Movie..if you Don't EXPECT it to be a DOCUMENTARY (which you shouldn't),8,19 April 2005,"Amityville Horror is a story about a family (Lutz) that moves into the Amityville house one year after the brutal murder of a family (DeFeo's)...Lets get something straight that the only part of the STORY that is based on a true story: - Ronnie DeFeo killed his mother, father, and 4 children in the house which is told at the first. - Lutz DID move into the house about a year after the bizarre murdersFor the most part the rest is Hollywood fabricated.The story works gradually and the house environment is spooky enough to allow you to get in the ""mood"" so to speak.There are a few ""jumpy"" scares in the movie, but really it is the mood of the movie that makes it eerie and a little scary. To me this movie was more suspense and mystery than a horror film. This is one of the best horror movies made as of late, even though it isn't perfect it is much better than the recent horror flicks..the likes of Grudge, Ring II, Cursed, Boogey Man, Darkness, etc.As stated this is NO documentary...if you don't expect it to be, then you should enjoy the movie like I did.",The Amityville Horror
450,maximctu,Reasonably Satisfying Scare Fest- worth a look on the big screen,6,27 April 2005,"Before seeing this years remake of The Amityville Horror I was quietly confident that my appetite for a genuinely creepy an unsettling cinematic experience would be sated. It certainly appeared more promising than many of the other blood drenched offerings in this recent glut of decidedly ropey remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Exorcist: The Beginning). Up to a point, Amityville succeeds where many other horror films released in recent years have failed. It maintains an eerie sense of foreboding from the out set, and the scares come thick and fast right from the off. The actors acquit themselves well for the most part and the direction, although fairly typical from what we've come to expect from this type of film, is carried out perfectly satisfactorily. In fact, for the first 45 minutes-an hour, I was very much taken by the film and found my self genuinely unnerved on more than one occasion. However, my principle gripe is that this film seemed to rush itself in the final act. Things seemed to gather too much momentum and the expiation of what is really going on in the house coupled with the maddening climax of final reel comes across slightly disjointed from what has come before it. Whereas before things built steadily, things seem to jump from 3rd. to 5th. gear in a heart beat and before you can actually register whats going on its all over. This leaves a bit of a bitter aftertaste on what started out as promising to be an excellent horror film, something thats been lacking in recent years. However, I found that this films falls short of classic status due to the rushed last 20 or so minutes, and is simply just average as a result.It would have been much better if it was about 15 minutes longer. Its still well worth a look on the big screen though, and is definitely a cut above the usual boring, formulaic horror fare that we have to put up with. Good, should have been GREAT.",The Amityville Horror
451,Kateeh,Based on the novel!,8,11 May 2005,"I have noticed that some people are ranking on The Amityville Horror, the 2005 movie, because it is not accurate to what really happened to the DeFeo family. However, I would like to mention that the movie is based on the book by Jay Anson, who is listed in the credits as the writer of the NOVEL. Novel=fiction=made up. If you are thinking about going to see this movie, please don't let the negative comments keep you from going. The movie really was very good. If it is possible for you to watch a movie and not worry about it's historical accuracy, and just be entertained by it, then I would definitely suggest seeing The Amityville Horror. I figure if you really wanted a history lesson you could get one elsewhere.",The Amityville Horror
452,gallopgirl88,The Only Horror Movie That Has Actually Scared Me,10,23 April 2005,"I went to see this movie thinking that it would be another crappy overrated horror, so I went with another girl because she was the only other person that could go at the time (most of my friends were at work). Within the first 20 minutes of the movie we completely regretted not bringing guys with us. No horror movie I have ever seen has really scared me (i.e. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original & remake), Wrong Turn, The Ring, Friday the 13th series, Nightmare On Elm Street series, basically, you name it, I've probably seen it), however, my friend and I were clutching each others hands so hard almost the entire movie, that the next day, my hand and fingers still hurt and my knuckles were swollen. I really don't know why it scared me so bad, because it's based very loosely on a true story, what happened in the movie didn't really happen in real life (except a few select events). When I was driving home from the movie, I was so freaked out, after a went around a turn, a possum was in the middle of the road walking, and I actually screamed and swerved, not because I didn't want to hit it, but it actually scared me. This movie is definitely worth the $6 or $7 dollars to see it (however, I wouldn't recommend eating during the movie, there are a few gory scenes, they're not too bad if you're used to it, only one scene really grossed me out). I would definitely go and see this movie a second time around in theaters, so, if you like these kind of movies, you should definitely go see this one.",The Amityville Horror
453,lonesomekiller,Well done,8,16 April 2005,"I have to say, when I originally saw the trailer for this movie, I had my doubts because we all now how some remakes just don't live up to their originals. To make sure that this movie was the real deal, I went ahead and rented the original from Blockbuster. Let's just say that after seeing the two- the original is laughable compared to the remake.The movie was well worth the ticket price and Reynolds actually plays the part of George well although I had my doubts. It was a great horror movie experience, and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys that genre, I know I do and I was thoroughly pleased.My only beef with the movie was the incredibly stupid (at times) script, but hey what can you expect from the guy who ruined Batman (twice) and screwed up Pearl Harbor by throwing in a love triangle?",The Amityville Horror
454,jeffr66-1,Mixed Bag,5,18 April 2005,"I was so disappointed in this remake. They had all the right ingredients - I really liked Ryan Reynolds and Melissa George as George and Kathy Lutz. I thought the production design was excellent - especially the house. But what I HATED was how the remake completely disregarded the events in the book. At least the original movie followed the book more closely, whether you believe the whole thing was a hoax or not. I think it was a mistake turning Jodie the pig into Jodie the murdered DeFeo girl. I didn't care for the whole Indian torture chamber in the basement. What happened to the marching band music the Lutz's heard coming from the living room, or the stone lion that supposedly came to life and bit George? The blood dripping from the walls? And they completely cut the role of the priest to a cameo. In fairness, the remake wasn't terrible, but I just wasn't too happy with the script. Plus, it wasn't scary. The original was slow, but it also was able to creep me out more than the new one did.",The Amityville Horror
455,marissa-cohen,Best Horror movie made in the last 5 years...,8,11 August 2005,"To everyone who has completely NITPICKED and trashed this movie: Get over yourselves. You're obviously upset because you have neither the talent nor the vision to create any film, let alone a Horror film, of any substance. This is the best horror flick of the last five years, possibly even the decade. I don't know if anyone has noticed, but horror films have gone downhill in recent years. Every new movie is just a copy of the previous with a different ""bad guy"". For those of you who have said that The Shining is a more qualified horror film: The Shining is NOT a true Horror genre film! It is a psychological suspense thriller with lots of blood and a scary dead kid (see, every movie has one). As for this remake, they did a good job at it. It's the first movie I've seen in YEARS that actually made me scream and jump. As for Ryan Reynolds' sculpted body, everyone wasn't fat and soft in the 70's, people did have nice bodies. Sorry if you're just an overweight jealous guy who couldn't stomach his insatiable ""man-lines"", get over it. The scares were Far more original than any movie in recent years, and yes, it did start to lose me a little in the last 30 minutes. But it was one one hell of a ride up to that point. I have been a horror fanatic since I was 6, I love being scared. And this is the first movie in a long time that actually had me amped up as I left the theater.

456,battleangel-1,i saw this trash over Sin City.,1,15 April 2005,"I saw this trash over Sin City.I will list 6 reasons (in no particular order) not to see this movie and hope this will help future moviegoers not to make the same choice I so vehemently regret.1. PREDICTABLE-From the first 20 minutes of the movie you know the whole movie. This movie was VERY predictable. 2. HISTORICALLY INACCURATE-Words such as 'cool' and etc. were used. These words are not used in the 70's. Characters clothing and attitudes also did not fit the decade(especially Melissa George's Character) 3. SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE JUST PLAIN STUPID- This comment is most likely made by me because I have seen better horror movies previously where the effects were very good (such as the Grudge and the Ring Two) But besides that it seemed like it was a silly American sort of ripoff of the ""little scary children with black hair"" talking to other normal kids and showing them pictures todraw. Which I'm sure the American public should be tired of by now. 4.DIRECTION IS SILLY- It really just is. It was almost like I was watching ""Scary Movie"" trying to be serious. I'm sure even Mo the homeless guy down the street from my house could direct better then this piece of trash. 5. MORE GORY THAN SCARY- If you like nonsense gore splattering around for no reason this is the movie has just that but even you gore lovers shouldn't see this movie the gore here is plentiful but not at all scary. 6. BAD ACTING- Melissa George just can no act. She cannot cry. It looks like shes acting... which defeats the whole purpose of acting. The kids in the movie did a great job however especially Jesse James character Billy.Please I beg you do not waste your money on this movie. Just go see Sin City.. its still out in theaters and you still have time. If you did see this movie please ask your theater for a refund, it is wrong and unlawful for people to sit through this trash.",The Amityville Horror

The part where the boy goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night was good! It actually made me jump out of my seat! I also enjoyed the part where Ryan Reynold (George) kills the dog! It is gruesome and sad too. I also enjoy the part when he tears down the basement wall and starts seeing all those bodies. I definitely recommend everyone to go and see this movie!

The man has amazing comedic timing even for a horror flick. I never would have thought the two guys and a girl star would be where he is now.

The only down side was there was a scene where there is animal cruelty, so if you don't want to see that then close your eyes 3/4 of the way thru the movie when the lovely half naked Ryan Reynolds goes out to the boat shed and the dog is there. Otherwise I loved this movie and cant wait for it to come out on DVD. Mellissa George and Ryan Reynolds both act very well. I have no idea why they felt the need to change all the children's names tho. Also the priest was barely in it and that was a major part of the first movie.",The Amityville Horror
464,six6stones,SCARIEST Movie I've Seen In A LONG TIME!,10,16 April 2005,"The Amityville Horror would have to be one of, if not the, scariest movies I've seen. I mean, I saw SAW, THE RING 1 and 2, TAKING LIVES etc but none come close to the chill/squeal factor of this movie. For the length of its 87 minutes(or so) of duration, this film provides non-stop jumps and thrills, as the Lutz's 'get acquainted' with their new house. Melissa George and Ryan Reyolds give very credible performances and the little girl is especially brilliant. Watch particularly for the real reason the house is haunted and it will chill you to the bone. By the end of this film, if you're anything like me, you too will be yelling, GET OUT OF THE FREAKIN' HOUSE!",The Amityville Horror
465,MajinLostSoulDX,A very good movie.,10,16 April 2005,"I've seen my fair share of horror movies, and I'd say this one is a great movie! It's loosely based on a true story. There were part where I jumped out of my seat even though I knew what was coming and other parts that just plain freaked me out. I think Ryan Reynolds played the part of George really well. The buildup to George's insanity was interesting. I liked how he got all in Billy's face and asked if they were having fun. That was funny. The part with the girl on the roof caught me completely off guard. I liked the ending also. I figured they would live even though I've never seen the original.Overall, it was quite a good horror. Not the best this year, but it's up there. Boogeyman was far more frightening in comparison. You want a fright? Watch that movie. Amityville isn't as scary as that, but it's quite good.",The Amityville Horror
466,DrummerBoy026,Better than the original,10,11 April 2005,"I just got back from the Red carpet premiere on Thursday (I'm that dedicated to travel all the way to California), let's just say that even the stars of the movie were screaming, it was THAT scary. Let me start by saying this is better than the original in every single possible way. Reynolds pulls off a serious role well, and is not overacted a la James Brolin. The kids are great, the girl who befriends Jodie DeFeo (The only downside to the film is that they changed Allison's name to this to fit Jodie, in my opinion it would've worked better if she just made up a name for her old name). It also serves as more of a complete film. It goes more on the John Ketchum aspect of the story. There is no ""red room"" thank god.It is SCARY. Its use of suspense is great. There's one particular scene in the bathroom with one of the children and the closet scene which are must sees. Jodie is the creepiest ghosts ever. There is actually a story to it, unlike most horror movies.The 87 minutes which it runs will feel like you lived the 28 days the Lutzes experienced in that house, not only because it follows you through the days, but because you're put in their shoes: How much can we(the Lutzes) take of this before we leave? When they leave, you want to leave. Before then, you just want to wait things out. And the waiting feels like 28 days, because the evil never stops.",The Amityville Horror
467,katekoala21,I liked it !!,8,22 April 2005,"I won't write a huge plot summery, I just would like to say it was one of the best 'scary' films I have seen in a while.I have read many peoples comments, who have either dissed Ryan Reynolds, compared the movie to the original or the book, and I have to say that I disagree with most of the comments.I have more often seen Ryan as character Michael Burgen in 2 guys & a girl, which is a comedy (he plays the goofy guy well) and I was curious to see how he would cope with this kind of role - and I have to admit he did it very well. Most of the women will enjoy his frequent shirtless scenes (as did I) but he plays the psycho extremely well. I found the film much better than the original, and although I have not read the book (I have read countless other info on this topic) I feel that at the end of the day, this is a horror film, and it does exactly what it says on the tin! There are plenty of frights, jumps, and scares to keep all us avid horror movie go-er's happy, and I was ! So please, other comments that say its the worst film etc etc - I strongly disagree, and urge other viewers that it is definitely worth a watch (I guarantee you will physically jump in your seat more than once!)

The don't have ""a big reveal"" at the end, nor to they have to go and explain everything you've just seen or what they are about to do. You know some movies, the bad guy says, ""now that I've got you I'm going to tell you everything I'm going to do, just in case you try and stop me.""

470,wxmlad85,"After buying a house, The Lutz family, start to unravel a horrifying tale of murder and spirits",10,24 April 2005,"This was a remake of the 1979 classic from the Amityville Series. The film starts off with a guy loading bullet into a rifle while a voice whispers ""Ketch 'Em & Kill 'Em"" which is the tag-line for the movie, The man moves onto kill his whole family by shooting them in the back of the head while they lay asleep in bed, and shooting the little girl (Jade) in the head. One year on from the incident. a new family buys that same house and strange things start to happen, now according to the mothers daughter Chelsea, Jodie is her friend, you see Jodie various times in the film, but she wants the dad gone. There are quite a lot of things that made em jump in the film, especially right before the end, its very unexpected but disappointing in some respects. When i went to watch this film, i did not think i would like it due to the fact one of the lead roles is played by Ryan Reynolds (Two guys & a girl, Blade Trinity) i didn't think i could take him seriously in a horror, but he brought much needed humor to the film, he played his part very well, it was a change for him, and it suited him. He suited being possessed by the same thing that happened in the beginning, as her turned from a loving family man into a raging psychotic maniac. One part where he brought much needed humor was where Chelsea was walking along the roof at the top of the house, saying that Jade was taking her to see her dad (who is dead, Ryan Reynolds is Melissa George's boyfriend) after they rescue her from the roof and get her inside, after she has had a shouting at off her mum, Ryan walks just around the corer as he discovers why she was on the roof and as Melissa tells her ""i know you miss daddy, he is with the angels in heaven"" Ryan walks over and comes out with ""What is wrong with you people?"" drops Chelseas teddy and walks off mumbling to himself ""Nutty Family"" or something like that.",The Amityville Horror

475,Jim276825,Not bad for a modern horror remake,6,17 April 2005,"This is slightly superior to recent horror flicks like The Grudge, White Noise, etc, and it's a genuine improvement on the original. Here, the director relies - too heavily for me - on quick edits to create instant ""jump in your seat"" moments. Personally, I'd have preferred to see less use of this gimmick, and more subtle tension-building techniques employed. For example - when the the two prospective new owners of the house are being shown around it, in the opening scenes, the sales agent shows them the cellar, yet decides against following them down there. This is hardly a terror-inducing moment, but it's the kind of delicate, subtle angle that can be used quite effectively in horror movies, especially in the earlier scenes.Alas, the producers of this remake concentrate upon cramming in as many scares as possible from a limited repertoire of tricks. On that level, they more or less succeed but personally I felt that on a few occasions, the director really tried to cram in too many of these, to the point of including several fantasy and dream/nightmare shots which seemed to be present for no other purpose than to ""up"" the shock factor.Ryan Reynolds gives a solid performance, and the child actors are suitably convincing. Melissa George does her best with a fairly limited and one-dimensional character. The setting (house) is quite creepy, with good use of it's interior and exterior. The film's pacing was about right, everyone going to see this film knows what to expect so they do get down to business fairly quickly, although there's some good interplay between the family characters once they've moved into the house.The scenes with the local priest were quite disappointing, this being one specific aspect of the film that isn't an improvement on the original. Also, as other reviewers have commented, the ""pig eyes"" moment from the 1979 version doesn't feature here.It will be interesting to see what happens from here; the 2005 version is opening on around twenty three million dollars in the US this weekend, so a domestic gross of between fifty and seventy $m should ensure a sequel is rubber-stamped. The ending of this version of The Amityville Horror certainly leaves the door open for a follow-up, which wouldn't be reliant upon any of the actors used this time, as common sense dictates that a second instalment would see a new family move into the house.In summary, I would recommend this to fans of the horror genre, and to cinema-going regulars who want an enjoyable night out. A solid six out of ten.",The Amityville Horror

Ryan Reynolds was actually surprisingly good in the film. Yes, Van Wilder acted. The scares were just that, scares. I've seen more than my share of horror films and I always pinpoint the moment the cat jumps out. Not this time. No cat. That's all I'm gonna say. Enthralled as I was by the first hour or so (and I'm talking a five star movie at this point) the last half hour left me flat. But, I digress. I did think that first hour was amazing. Faster paced than original and it went for the more visceral scares which do work most of the time. I give this flick a 7 out of 10. I have voted it an 8 out of 10 simply because it was rated R. Kudos to the filmmakers for not appealing only to the in school crowd. We're adults, we can take it. Thank you guys for letting US make that decision.",The Amityville Horror

479,ohthajimpanity-1,Another Horror Film with Potential Gone Wrong,2,15 April 2005,"I grew up watching the original Amityville Horror and its unfortunate sequels (except Amityville 2-it was actually scary), and I realize that the original is considered cheesy now. When I first saw the trailer for the remake, I was intrigued. Even after I saw Michael Bay's involvement I decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt after his producing of the less-than-mediocre remake of the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre-one of my all-time favorites. From the first frames of the new Amityville, I knew it was going to be bad, but still I gave it a chance. Ryan Reynolds (incredibly hot with a beard) was probably the only redeeming quality of this film. The entire film spent its time beating the crap out of the audience with a loud score and obnoxious, annoying quick flashes along with the played ""jittering"" people that intends to scare, but merely causes eyes to roll. There is no attempt at suspense or even any successfully-delivered shock/surprise scares. Thanks to ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Grudge"", and the horrid ""Hide and Seek"" utilization of spooky little kids, Hollywood apparently feels the need to work in this aspect in every film, even if it is not needed. The original Amityville was successful without it, and it was just one of the many strikes the remake had against it. There is a scene mid-way through the picture that was nearing intensity level and for a moment I thought it may turn around and get better. Alas no. There was nothing to look forward to but complete disappointment. Another way the original succeeded was the way nothing was really explained. According to it, the basement housed ""The Gateway to Hell,"" without showing the audience anything but red lights on staring actors. Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake scene where Leatherface takes off his mask, somebody decided to put a face on the mystery of Amityville with added exposition played incredibly cliché. If you must see this film, save your money and get it for change on netflix.",The Amityville Horror
480,NKellyle,What a huge disappointment!!!,1,16 April 2005,"I remember reading the original book by Jay Anson, while in my room alone when i was a teenager. I was so scared that i could no longer read it unless i was in a room with other people. Couldn't even take the book back to my room at night. It's a crying shame that no one stuck to the facts in the book. This movie could have been a huge blockbuster had they done that. I saw one effect reminiscent of Freddy Krueger in the girl's closet, then another effect similar to 13 Ghosts. This story was scary on it's own, without all the extra dramatics. They didn't even use the old song, which would scare the heck out of anyone. But yet, they used the song in their previews. Can't figure that one out. Had they simply gone with the original story, this would have been a great film. Also, i thought James Brolin and Margot Kidder were much more convincing as George and Kathy Lutz. I have given up on today's filmmakers.",The Amityville Horror
481,taker_awayer_89,Better than I expected...,8,16 April 2005,"I went into the theatre with mixed expectations... Thinking of Ryan Reynolds in a serious character position (Blade: Trinity doesn't count here) sounded dangerous, but interesting, and I wasn't disappointed. He plays George Lutz, an easy-going guy with a great lifestyle. Recently married, he lives with his new wife Kathy (Mellisa George) who most Aussies will recognise from the long-running series 'Home and Away.' Reynolds doesn't let us down in one of his best performances, considering before this his history contained comedy all around. The movie starts off in good fashion also. Instead of a long, boring start sequence, the action kicks off around 10 minutes in, and i'm sure a lot of people will appreciate this.The main storyline revolves around the Lutz family, including Kathy's children Billy, Michael and Chelsea, who have recently moved into a deceivingly beautiful Victorian house inside a gorgeous forest-like surrounds of Amityville, and their 28 day stay before fleeing the house in terror, never to return again, even for their possessions. The movie tells as much as possible on what the Lutz family encountered in those 28 days, and all I can say is this... a terrifying sequence of events which in turn, turned out to be a true story. If you're like me and enjoy a faster-than-average storyline with fast thrills and action, this is the movie for you...But I warn you, the jumpy fright scenes aren't seen coming, so be careful!!! 8/10",The Amityville Horror
482,jwhitley,Much better than I expected.,8,16 April 2005,"I was really surprised by this movie. I was expecting to be a little freaked out and see some gore, but there were a few things I wasn't expecting. I didn't think the acting would be all that good and I figured allot of the scares would be very cheap. What do I mean by a ""cheap"" scare? Like a character walking into a silent room and looking around confused, then the stereo comes on at full volume and it only makes you jump because of the sudden volume change. *cough*WHATLIESBENETH*cough*This movie didn't have any of that and the suspense was well layered, though the story was a bit slow at times. Only once did I catch myself loosing interest when a long string of creepy scenes came together and it seemed like they were just going for one scare after another. But just as I was thinking that, it went back into the story and the plot was advanced a few steps. Last thing I will mention is the acting. I don't know that I have seen Ryan Reynolds or Melissa George in anything else (I'll go check in a second...), so I didn't know what to expect. I think they did a great job though. At the beginning of the movie, Reynolds is convincing in the nice guy role and seems to really love his family. As the movie goes on, he slowly looses his mind as the house gets to him, turning him against the kids, and eventually his wife. Melissa George does a good job of crying allot, and looking really scared. All in all, this was a good film. I thought it was better done than the recent Texas Chainsaw remake. Hopefully there will be more horror films this good in the near future.",The Amityville Horror

If you go and see it you will know what I mean. The kids in the movie did play an excellent roles. What was up with the babysitter scene? That kind of made me sick to my stomach. I think that could have been left out of the movie. But overall i did enjoy the movie, it had some humor that did catch me off guard in a supposedly scary film. The best part is when Ryan Reynolds was getting questioned by his wife at the dinner table and he comments ""I thought this was suppose to be Meat loaf"". another good part that you could not hold in the laughs was when Ryan Reynolds told the older kid to hold onto the log while he cuts it.",The Amityville Horror

Even though the actors who play the parents are younger than the real Lutzes were, they did a great job. For those of us who are old enough to remember when the first book and the movie came out, and how scary I thought it was at that time. We rented it a couple of years ago, and laughed at most of it.

486,jmdermott,Michael Bay is Dangerous!,2,16 April 2005,"My take on this film is best expressed in the form of a letter to director Michael Bay:Dear Mike, I don't know who your Hollywood studio friends are but I'm certain they're in very high places. How you are continuously allowed to take these wonderful stories with great movie potential and simply make a joke out of each and every one of them is beyond my understanding. I know it is not cheap so I assume your friends have money to burn. Perhaps making a good film is never on your agenda to begin with. Maybe its all about taking sensational subject matter and backing it up with millions of dollars worth of marketing and publicity. (I thank God you weren't trusted with Titanic!) Either way, I beg you to stop this madness at once!As for my opinion of the Amityville Horror; another one bites the dust. Amityville starts out looking like it might just be good. A great story that many of us are familiar with, given a just redo with all the benefits 25 years of cinematic improvement can offer. Not to mention a big studio budget. Unfortunately the beginning of the film is about all thats worth seeing. Once we are introduced to the new and improved Lutz family, things start going sour fast. The excessive smooching between Cathy and George was overkill. Casting a closet homosexual as the burly, blue collar Mr. Lutz made every scene with him in it very difficult to watch or even try to believe. (No offense intended toward Mr.Reynolds) If Kiss and Alice Cooper were the only period references you could think up to bring us back to the 70s then you should have hired a consultant for a couple dozen more. (Ever heard of Led Zep?) By the way, what the hell was that montage music supposed to be 70ish? The crap hits the fan a little too fast and George starts to loose the audience before he had the chance to win them over to begin with. Your fixation on Jodie really killed what could have been a significant and scary character. The first few shots of Jodie worked well but the remaining 18 or so were almost sleep-inducing. You showed us in the beginning that you knew about all 6 people who were murdered yet you decided to leave all the haunting to Jodie alone. Thanks for trying to clean everything up with the Ketchum theory. Unfortunately, it did not work well. Perhaps in the horror/thriller genre its best to leave some things in the realm of the unknown. I took the liberty to rent the DVD of the campy, low-budget original 1979 film and watched it the night before your film’s release just to get myself revved up. Heres what I want to point out: You had the budget and technical advantage but still could not scare your audience. (Shock, yes. Scare, no). The original inspired many horror films to follow, including Steven Spielbergs Poltergeist. Your film only drew from past works and was very cliché. The original did not discount the effect of good film MUSIC! Its score alone was the definition of creepy to the 10th power! Your .50 cent score was difficult to remember even while it was still playing. The HOUSE in the first film was just that...a house. In fact, in reality it was just a house. It was the portrayal of the house in the first film that made it so scary. The slight redness in the upstairs windows was more than enough to drive this point all the way home. Your house, on the other hand was hollywoodized to the MAX. Just from the poster I could tell you went way over the edge and built yourself a Psycho-esquire MANSION!!! (The Lutzs paid 80 thousand not 500 thousand Mike!) From the peeling paint all over the exterior and the multi-gabled roof, to the labyrinth in the basement and the cartoonishly skewed upstairs windows, your version was definitely bigger but not better. One more thing: did you think you had to do that to Harry the dog in order to appeal to the desensitized youth of this generation? Big mistake. You might as well have superimposed Jack Nicholsons character from The Shining in Georges Place. and the Silent Hill scary effect has been overdone. It is no longer effective. I must admit that some of your cinematography was beautiful but it happened to be in a very bad movie. Bad writing, directing, scoring, and overall bad decision-making. You could have seized this opportunity and put a lot of good material into this film. Material from the book, the old movie and from interviews with the Lutzs themselves. Instead you chose to dwell in the realm of typical and blasé and so you have yet another Michael Bay dud to show for it.In closing, I hope you make a hell of a lot of money off this film and go into an early retirement PLEASE!!!JM",The Amityville Horror
487,jwfoster27,Better than the Original?,9,17 April 2005,"When it comes to making a film in Hollywood these days it would appear that they are running out of original material. Any film that is over 10 years old has the chance of being remade but the real question is which will be better. This is a film that breaks the normal mold of being awful compared to its predecessor. I actually really enjoyed this remake and found myself more scared in this one than the original. Was this film Better? No. But it holds its own on its own merits. Having read the book, this one is a little more true to the story and for that I applaud the film makers. The film was very good and I rate it in my Horror Hall of Fame.In this particular version of the film it could be said that it was more accurate to the original book. And for those who consider this to be a hoax there has never been any proof either way. It is quite interesting to hear people who think they are authorities on the matter. Most people probably have not even read the book. There have been more than one book written about what happened in the house and the house the stood on the same location prior to the incident with the Lutz family. This film represents more than just the book the Amityville Horror. It takes its cues from the different novels that have been written about the event and the location. This movie is very scary, and has lots of good jumps in it. The director of the film was obviously very interested in not making a film that came across as a remake but one that could stand on its own merits and not those of its previous incarnation. When I go to a film I judge it by several different criteria since I used to be a movie critic for a reputable newspaper. These criteria are the following. 1. How did the movie effect the audience in general? 2. Storyline cohesion. 3. Special Effects (ie. did they detract from the movie, overpower the movie, or just assist in the telling of the movie) 4. Can it stand on its own if its a Prequel, Sequel or Remake. 5. When I left the movie did I feel like I had been part of it (ie Suspension of Disbelief)When I look at the Amityville Horror it scored highly in all of these categories, especially the last which in my opinion is the most important of the 5. When you walk out from a film and you were ready to leave because the movie was good enough to make you feel as if you were part of it, it was just a good movie. Most people have preconceived ideas about what a movie should be like when they go into it. I on the other hand go in as blank slate as possible so I can take the movie for its own worth and nothing else. It is a suggestion that I would give to all movie goers, don't go in prejudging a film because of the movies prequels, or predecessors. This movie is a prime example of trying to compare it to the original. The two movies were very different takes on the story and should be viewed as such.",The Amityville Horror
488,shmoo_,Is it true or not? Movie is still good,7,17 April 2005,"The movie was pretty good for the most part. I've been a fan of amittyville for some time. As far as if it is true to the book, who is to say what is really true? Think about it from Hollywood's perspective. You are trying to compete with movies like poltergeist, Aliens and such from that time 76-78 time period. What better way then to build an American legend. Say Hollywood was having some trouble putting together a movie about Ronald DeFeo (whether it was due to at the time legal probs, or due to bad timing),what would be the next best thing? Get the rights to the house. You take a huge tragedy, pay a family to live in the house (13 months from when it happened), to act out events that the neighbors/priest(it also helps if the priest can't remember what happened)/ and locals can help testify to/ do minor scare tactics for other locals, pay a writer to compose their story and send the family on tour for the American audience during the push of the book and movie to attest that it is true. Please! That is just a giant reality show. Aside from the rant I like the series and the movies, with exception to Amittyville 3d,"" be afraid of the giant cartoon fly that moves across your screen and doesn't move its wings because it was drawn in... or beware green glowing blobs of light... blea! This remake was good, but it was missing some of the traditional elements. The priest scene was very weak, as were the cgi flies. The religious conflict aspects of the movie was barely touched upon until the end of the movie, that was disappointing. It may just be a little nostalgia, but I missed the innocent sounding music, or any real elements of it. This version relied more on shock value while scarifying story. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It is just me to voice the things that bugged (bad pun) me about it. I did like the moody atmosphere that just grew, the seventies movie lacked that. I felt that while this was a huge side step from the first movie/book, it still held its own weight decently. 2 things totally cliché, the babysitter (yeah was that obvious or what) and the boat ending (that was weak).",The Amityville Horror

This movie is not a terrible movie at all. I was expecting a little more excitement and at least a little scare. If you are expecting the movie to give you jumps and shrills, you will be disappointed. This is one of those movies where the previews grab you and the actually movie tends to let you down. The cast is great but the film is okay. I'm not sure if I prefer this version over the original, but I wouldn't say it's a waste of money to go check out. This is a good movie to watch.

490,mlmarshall-1,"Did exactly what it was supposed to- scared me, and made me remember it when I turned off the lights to go to bed.",7,18 April 2005,"The Ammitlyville Horror is a good fright flick. The story is about the Lutzs', a young family who move to a ""too good to be true"" old house, only discover it has a dark past and control over members of the family. It's one of those stories that seems almost unbelievable, but believable enough that you start to wonder and get a little scared. There are some ""jump out of your seat"" scenes, making for more than a couple of good scares. The movie is well acted and well directed, and the scenes featuring old newspaper clippings and broadcasts about the house add some authenticity to the story, making it even more frightening.The reason the movie didn't score higher with me is that there was very little explanation of the history of the house. The story is alluded to and mentioned briefly, but it's treated more like a back story to the the story of the Lutz family, when really the house is just as important to the movie as the Lutzs'.Overall, The Ammityville Horror did exactly what it was supposed to do-it scared me, and made me remember it when I turned off the lights to go to bed.",The Amityville Horror
491,GDBride529,Not a good movie... IF you're a fan of the book,2,18 April 2005,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone who has read the Jay Anson book and enjoyed it. I recently read the book because of the remake (and my love of Ryan Reynolds), although I was not alive at the time that this actually took place I became really intrigued by the events. By the time I finished reading the book I was pumped to go and see the movie. My husband (who did not know anything about the events) and I went to see it and came out truly disappointed. I can count on both of my hands the amount of events that coincided with the book, and those weren't even what really happened, according to the book. The movie itself had some scary parts although the end came out of nowhere. IF you chose to go and see this movie, do it with an open mind and don't go in looking for a retelling of the book or actual events. Good luck!",The Amityville Horror

He did really great(even tho his character was mean) in the butterfly effect!But i just wanted to say that everybody played their part and did an excellent job at it and made the movie turn out great!!!So my advice is for u all to go see the movie it is awesome! Even the little girl, Chloe, the new in introduced actor in this film did a wonderful job. I was scared to death, and so were my friends, i sat through the movie for a/b 5 minutes with my hand over my eyes, peeking through my fingers. I had an awesome time and i actually would like to go see the movie a second time and all of my friends agree with me and i wish that these actors read this site because i want them to know what a great and awesome job they did, and how much i enjoyed the movie.

493,shadodwlr,I'm impressed.......,10,18 April 2005,"I've been blow away completely by this movie.... I just saw the first Amityville a couple of weeks ago, this one makes that look like Saturday morning at Pee Wee's playhouse. I have to agree also with everything the main review says.... as a matter of fact, that review sums it up perfectly except for one thing, he doesn't really go into the actors at all and thats where I'd like to say I was most impressed. Now most people know Ryan Reynolds for his role in Van Wilder... a role in which though absolutely hysterical, didn't show off his acting potential half as well as this movie did... and man did he live up to his potential. I haven't seen a father as freaky as that since Jack Nicholson in the shining. His performance was dead on all the way through and I hope when it comes to award shows someone takes notice and gives the man the props he deserves.The other person who stole the show for me was someone who I've never heard of before and after further research into this site I find has no other acting credits. She's played by Isabel Connor and is by far one of the most terrifying children I've ever encountered in a movie before. As a matter of fact I think she ran circles around both Samara (from the ring) and that freaky little cat boy. (from the Grudge) The ironic thing is she's not even supposed to be the evil spirit dwelling in the house. I look forward to seeing her in other movies to come, she definitely has a huge career in front of her! All in all the cast, as well as the timing and careful editing made this without a doubt the must see horror movie of the year. Definitely go out and see it. Its a two hour thrill ride thats well worth the $8.00 you spent to go see it!!",The Amityville Horror

Ryan Reynolds does an excellent job in the role of George Lutz, and I had him pegged for a ""type cast good looking know it all"". The filmography is crafty, actually making you feel like your at this terrible place of death and sorrow. The children are amazingly good little actors as well. I have to say that i actually went home thinking that there was a good chance I was going to have nightmares. You'll want to bring your teddy bears and security blankets for this one.

495,contact-341,Nice Family. Mean House.,6,22 April 2005,"Fun, but not for the whole family. The original offered a rare opportunity for a remake because the story is great, but the original was a celluloid should-be-for-TV hack job. This remake renders the 'new house experience' in greater emotional detail, as it does the 'new house horror'. The babysitter-in-the-closet scene is much scarier, and it places blame for the event where it belongs. Computer Generated Imaging is a boon to horror, but, as in other genres, producers think CGI can smooth over plot holes and jump cuts in character development. That happens here, perhaps because there was a slasher in the editing room. It doesn't kill the flick though. Fun, but not for the whole family.",The Amityville Horror

Half the time I could predict what was going to happen. The music and way that they approached certain parts let you know to expect some type of ""scary"" surprise. The actors in it were great, there were a few parts where they could have used some help. The gore make up wasn't scary, it was unbelievable, it made it funny. True, it was well written with a good story line, and had some interesting parts, and good actors, but I was bored the whole time I was watching it. Maybe I've seen too many horror movies I can't enjoy them anymore cause they're all so predictable.",The Amityville Horror
497,alias_47-1,Horrible. Enough said.,1,2 April 2006,"Why, oh why, oh WHY did they remake this movie? I've seen the 1979 version multiple times, and while it was never a favourite, it is practically Oscar-worthy compared to the remake. First of all, everything was over-done. I can't even think of a scene that wasn't. The whole scare-factor in the original was in *not* seeing things. It was in knowing that something was there, but not knowing what. The they remake it where you can see the ghosts, and it is laughable. It is no longer scary. Then there was the over emphasis of everything to the point where I couldn't finish the movie (I'm not going to get into all of that, because I don't want to spoil it for any poor souls who choose to watch). On top of that, the scenes filled by random flashes of Ryan Reynold's abs. Not that I'm complaining here, the man is hot! It was the only thing that kept me awake. But, a movie shouldn't have to be carried by a wet, washboard stomach. Bottomline: don't waste your money, don't waste your time. If you want to see this, rent the original.",The Amityville Horror
498,john-finlay,What A Disappointment !,5,26 April 2005,"When I first heard that this film was being remade, I was really pleased. During the 26 years since the original, the movie industry has improved leaps and bounds in the special effects department. Having read the book, which I rate in my all time best, I could see countless improvements there for the making. You can then imagine my disappointment when I watched this 2005 remake. Large parts are simple copies of the first movie and the rest is at best slightly different! The book had you hanging on a cliff edge and wanting to read more. The film for me had me fallen over a cliff edge waiting for the end to come, so I could go home. I kept telling myself that it would get better but unfortunately, it did not. I left feeling very disappointed and indeed conned in to thinking that the remake would be better. The acting was not bad but the story could have been truer to the book, which would have made it a great film. Why oh why did the makers not read the book, ignore the original and then make it. I struggled to rate this at even 5 from 10 and frankly, the 1979 version would rate higher. Do yourself a good turn, watch this film if you have to but, afterwards buy the book and have the ride of a lifetime!",The Amityville Horror

Two thing that I don't like about the the original, the spirit black hole behind the stairway (its so retarded) and lack of house's history. The new version (2005), its pretty much similar. BUT it includes what I wanted to see in the original one, more information about the house itself, show more of its history. I appreciated that a lot. The new version has no its own style or got something to be famous known as... like the girl in ""The Ring"", Dark Castle's edgy walk technique (Gothika, 13 Ghosts etc.) Nothing exciting or amazing about this movie. Its all typical, same old same old. But yet this movie gives me several chills and jumps. I have to give this movie an 8. Good story, actors, filming techniques, and scares.",The Amityville Horror
501,pauljahill,What a wicked film!,10,18 May 2005,"So...., where can I start. Well this film is perfect for one of those nights out at the cinema with your boy/girl/romantic/friend or a night in with a big bowl of popcorn because there are moments in this movie which you definitely have to hold on tight to the one you care about because this film is (in my opinion) the scariest to be released in ages! Day1: Everything seems quite normal and happy but quickly you realise that this ain't gonna be no ""Van Wilder"" as Ryan Reynolds' (plays George the stepfather) performance starts to turn from his usual quirky fun character to making you feel like your that eight year old kid again whose getting a real telling off by your parents! You will feel scared! This movie not only has you gripped to the screen from start to finish but actually holds a level of tension that most movies these days in the same genre seem to lack! (Think Alien and your there!) The tension that is delivered by the film makers is outstanding! The house is terrifying yet has a certain appeal that makes you understand why the couple would want it! The performances from all the actors involved are Fantastic. Normally I feel some child actors performances can be a bit weak but this movie makes you feel sorry for the children involved because the terror they feel is an experience that most of us can relate to (and should never have to). This is a great one-off horror which doesn't leave much room for a second outing to the old house but thats okay because this film delivers everything you would want from the Haunted House genre which will make it a film that you will want to watch again and again! I recommend that you take someone to go see it with on a night time showing and you will have big fun! This is a great Horror/Thriller with really good effects and most importantly of all a great story, although maybe told before (1970s), This is a remake-turned-classic for our generation! Check it out before its gone!",The Amityville Horror
502,rollers-1,"It'll make you jolt, but you'll be able to sleep at night.",7,30 April 2005,"Not THE scariest movie of all time, but then again I don't think that was the aim of this movie. There aren't many true story horror flicks around, and any that do come out tend to be scary just for the fact that they did happen. The Amityville Horror does its job in telling a scary story, but I found some of the scenes to overplay the horror, and this (at times) took away from the realistic feel of the movie. Nonetheless I rated a 7 out of 10, because I did jolt a few times even though I expected not to. So despite some scenes that tried-to-hard, it is a scary movie, but not one of the scariest movies.

The beard helped me, psychologically, to get over the fact that I was watching Van Wilder in this role.Secondly, I am not completely convinced that this story is true, there just isn't enough factual evidence that states otherwise to change my mind.

504,peterjohnn,"A ""true"" and scary haunted house film. But which part is ""based on the true story""?",4,6 May 2005,"It was with great anticipation that I bought my ticket to ""THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (2005)"", but was a little disappointed with the remake of the film.It's always hard to judge a remake versus original. (It's the same in music). It usually goes like this - the the one you've seen first and the one you know, is the one you'll like better. If you've never seen the original, you'll probably think the remake is better.I do feel that the new movie had great shock value and great special effects and really did tell a great ""horror"" story. But I feel the ""based on the true story"" line left a bit to be desired.I was expecting this version to be based more on the actual events that the Lutz family endured during their 28 days in the house. I was wrong. I have done quite a lot of research on the real Amityville haunting, and there seemed to be quite a lot of inaccuracies.Firstly, if you're already familiar with the event, the house itself looked way too big, and the wrong type of architecture to resemble the real 112 Ocean Avenue, Amityville.In the opening scenes we witness Ronnie DeFeo murdering all six members of his family. All but one were shot to death in their beds. His youngest sister ""Jodie"" awoke and tried to hide but was shot to death in the cupboard. In my research, ALL members of the real DeFeo family were found murdered in their beds.In real life, Ronnies youngest sister's name wasn't Jodie. Jodie was the name of the imaginary ""ghost"" friend of the Lutz's daughter. I recall reading that ""Jodie"" was either a cat or a pig.The way that ""George Lutz"" is portrayed doesn't seem to fit the character of the ""George Lutz"" I've read about. Especially his ""Wood chopping obsession"". (This is also true of THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (1979)) From my reading, it is true that George never felt warm in the house but I've not once come across his obsession with wood-chopping. Nor have I read about the wood-chopping scenes with his step son.I don't ever recall reading about the ""rooftop"" scenes. Looking at photographs of the real 112 Ocean Avenue, the roof is so steep it seems almost IMPOSSIBLE for a child to actually get onto the top of the roof in the first place.Overlooking these aspects, I feel the storyline, acting and film quality was great. By all means, go and see it.As I said before, it's hard to judge a remake versus original. To me the original 1979 version (minus the 2005 technology)seems more realistic. I was surprised to read that the Lutz family didn't have any input into either of the 1979 or 2005 films. After all, this is supposed to be THEIR story! Having said that, I feel both THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (1979) and THE AMITYVILLE HORROR (2005)are great fright flicks that are both very loosely based on stories about what the Lutz Family encountered during the haunting in Amityville.",The Amityville Horror

It really reminded me a lot of one of the classic scary movies of all time and my favorite: The Shining. The one with Jack Nickolson and Popeye's wife. But, although it did have many similarities, it was no where near the quality of The Shining. Mainly it was the plot that was similar.

It was hardly ground-breaking stuff, but i never expected that it would be. An for a remake of an old 'classic' i thought it did a pretty stand-up job.The actors involved all done reasonably well, especially Ryan Reynolds. Considering i had only seen him in comedies before (with the exception of Blade Trinity) i was quite surprised that he managed to convince me that he was turning into an evil sod. However, i did feel that the whole babysitter sequence was a bit out of place, although it did serve its purpose as a bit of of comic relief.A couple of things that bothered me though. Firstly, i didn't think we saw George be tortured enough by these voices. I felt a wee bit like the final sequence was forced. Sure he was being an arse, but i would have liked to have seen him deteriorate even further. Also, where on earth did that shotgun spring from? I thought seen as they established the rope they tied him up with earlier on in the film, they would have at least had it sitting on top of the mantlepiece or something. Maybe it did crop up and i just missed it, i've only seen the film once!! But it just, again, seemed a bit forced. Oh and one more thing, at the end when shes taking him away on the boat, i'm not sure that i would have stopped like a hundred metres from the house, i'd have sailed that wee speedboat for at least an hour just to be sure! All in all though an enjoyable hour and a half.Lastly, the coffins??? i was like ""whaaaat?"" if he constructed those things in 28 days hes a genius.

The story is about a horrible murder that happened to the Defeo family, is they own child Ronald who killed their parents and siblings with a gun, with the reason that a voice told him to do it , few years after another family move in the same house that the tragedy happened, and between 28 days the start to felling a paranormal activity, threatening with repeat the history.The story that is the movie based on, is fascinating, and if the real factors of that maybe we will never know, is still a mystery, the Director do not care about the real factors he just wanted to make it interesting, making the story a paranormal movie, full of ghost, and family split.Adrew Douglas, decided to keep the steps of a typical horror movie frenetic edition, loud music rumbles, suspense, obviousness in all the movie, and everything that we already saw in many movies.This version of the movie is based in the family split than the paranormal activity, because at beginning we can see a lovely family, but when the move into that house that lovely family become in bitter family, maybe this movie is not so good, but I could be worst, I do not recommend this movie to children younger than 14 years old, because there are a lot of appearances, and many scary moments that will affect them, I give to this movie a 7 in a range of 1 to 10.I fell that I need to recommend you to see it because you will like, and the story is quite good.",The Amityville Horror

It stayed scary and creepy all of the way through and didn't get goofy or unrealistic at really any part which most scary movies do. The numerous scenes at the boat house added a lot of suspense to the movie. Most would agree that there is something creepy about water at nighttime. The acting was very good by all parties involved. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be creep-ed out.",The Amityville Horror
515,x_chriss,"It should be titled ""Haunted House""...",1,1 September 2005,"If this movie was about anything else but Amityville I would give it a 9. It has some elements that can spook us out. But it was supposed to be based on the acclaimed Jay Anson's book... seriously, it looks like nobody involved in the film making read it!!! It has almost none of the elements that made the book so fantastic. I was disappointed.1) Jodie, a girl? C'mon! So she's supposed to be more frightening than a huge ghost PIG??? Read the book and you will fear Jodie, the pig.2) They hardly saw spirits and these kind of stuff in the house. It's much more psychological horror, things moving, pigs (Jodie) stepping over you, pig ""footprints"" on snow, lion statues moving, than gore ghosts. Read the book!!! 3) Why does he wake up at 3:15 in the movie? Nothing is explained... I know, it's the time when Ronald got all possessed and killed his family. But the book version is far more disturbing... is the time of their necropsy!4) There never was a possession, and I thought that was completely pointless. (By the way, it was stupid to make George a stepfather instead of being the real father... pointless!)Finally, is a good horror movie, but a terrible, terrible book adaptation, but that's just my opinion.",The Amityville Horror

I've seen the original and decided that this movie was just as scary and just as thrilling. Also, this movie goes more into depth of what happened.

521,tbcat,Horrible piece of work,1,15 December 2006,Unbelievably bad. I saw that The Amityville Horror was playing on one of the premium channels. Thought it was the classic. It was the remake. Truly a pitiful movie. The first reviewer is right on target. The movie does not follow the book as claimed. It's your worse than basic B class horror flick. Total crap.To my delight the original with James Brolin and Margot Kidder was on tonight. Did some research again on the Amityville story. The Warrens (Ed and Lorraine) live near me. They are not liars. When they say this place is haunted by a demonic presence that's good enough for me. Google their website and see what they have to say about their investigation of that house. Talk about creepy. Sad that the real George Lutz passed away recently.,The Amityville Horror
522,adamvic79,"""Okay"" horror movie",8,10 January 2006,"The only reason to check out this movie is because Ryan Reynolds has various shirtless scenes. Other than that is an okay horror movie. Typical haunted house story with quite a few gore scenes. I'm glad they didn't pg-13 this because it would have been a very mediocre movie without the blood, gore, and scares. It has a few scenes that make you jump and one or two scenes that freak you out. It's a really short movie and the climatic ending is very good. It's honestly a lot better than the original which was a bore fest with no gore, swears, or any real scares. The best Amityville movie. I give it an 8 out of 10 because of Ryan Reynold who looks really good in the movie.",The Amityville Horror

There were no dull moments and the movie was high paced. It had all the ingredients for a good horror movie. Even the sight of the old house gave chills to my back. The acting was quite good even from the children. The movie was good at the beginning and got even better towards the end. It was a long time since i saw the original film, but i can't remember it to be as chilling as this one. The bottom line is that if you like to be scared at the movies, and don't mind to see some old tricks you've seen before, this one i a must see!",The Amityville Horror

I loved the fact that although this was a remake of classic film the actors especially Ryan Reynolds who adds a bit of comedy to whatever he does, didn't take anything to far which is a good thing considering this was a true story and over acting this could of led to trouble. The graphics during the film were excellent even though few were needed it gave the film that extra needed push to make it a great film.

It has nothing in it to distinguish itself from the typical scary/horror movie. Like this movie there are ""100 in a dozen"" available It was AGAIN your typical American scary movie, too predictable, dumb characters and AGAIN that same plot construction. OK, I should give it some credit because it's a remake. But come on, give me a break: I'm rather certain that nobody could give me one example of original film in this movie. The director just fixated on the: ""WAAAH => everybody is scared for 1 second => continue movie"" aspect. My advice: don't spend your money nor your time on this, you'll regret it. It fails on every level",The Amityville Horror
526,karugasaki,Horror? Yes. Amityville? Not so much...,8,1 October 2005,"If you want to see a scary, haunted house movie, this one is very good. As someone who watches a lot of horror movies, I'm not usually surprised by the flash appearance of a ghost/psycho killer/cat/what-have-you, I usually see those coming a mile away. This movie has a fair number of such shocker-scenes in hard to predict places. Also, Ryan Reynolds gives a surprisingly good performance. Melissa George is equally convincing in her role.However, and that's with a capital H, if you've seen The Shining, you will find this movie all-too-familiar. And, if you've seen the original Amityville Horror (or read the book), you might find this movie strangely unfamiliar. I mean, the fun of the Amityville Horror is that it is supposed to be a true story. I would have liked to have seen more of the ""facts"" of that story in this movie. The few that are present are changed or modified enough to almost not be considered as such.That aside, for new audiences I suggest seeing this one. It might scare you, and almost certainly entertain you.",The Amityville Horror
527,one69_ludwig,What a joke,1,6 October 2005,"The Amityville Horror is a classic. The house is iconic. The original movie is one of the two scariest movies ever made. I finally watched the DVD. This movie didn't even try to capture the original ""True Story"". Whether you believe the original story or not, there is still a story and it is the essence of the legend of Amityville. The 2005 movie is a weak hack. The house doesn't even look the same. Why wouldn't they make the house look the same? They thought they could make it better? Scarier? It can't get scarier. Where is Jodie the demonic pig? In the extras of the DVD the directors go on and on about how they tried to tell the original story which is just a complete lie. It's typical Hollywood, take a fantastic story pump it up on steroids and make a bad movie. As expected, it was high on cheap 'boos', low on plot. I won't even get into period recreation of the mid 1970's. These people looked and acted like it was 2004. And where did George Lutz get those abs? Come on, don't insult us.By the way there is no evidince that the Lutz's account of events were true, but on the other hand there's no evidence that their story was a fraud either. For those of you so conifident that it was faked, keep in mind no one has proof that it was faked. The Lutz's still hold to their story. Is it that far fetched to believe a family was terrorized in a haunted house? In the scheme of things, no. Does all this make sense? No. It doesn't have to. That's what draws us back again and again. DeFeo(a noted liar, I admit) still claims he was possessed at the time of the murders. The details of the murders are still mysterious to say the least. Keep an open mind because the jury is still out.",The Amityville Horror

The movie was fast paced and no problem keeping up with the storyline. At some points the horror was so intense I had to pause the movie and take a break. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes scary movies. The movie really explains the story and drags you in as soon as it starts. The visual effects and sound effects for detailed and right on cue. I would love to go visit this house...maybe I will see some ghost as well. As for the acting, I think Ryan Renolds did a great job.

I don't remember the original first, second or third Amityville Horror, or even if there was a second or third, so I can't compare it to the original. What makes a good horror movie? I would have to say, the ability to scare someone without all of the unnecessary gore. This movie did it well. No regrets here, although I do agree that the time period seemed a bit off. The ending was set up for potential sequels as well...I'm sure there going to be at least one more. It's definitely more entertaining than the average film, and a good one to watch if the Red Sox are down by 6 in the bottom of the eighth.I hope to see more movies like this in the future.",The Amityville Horror
530,cellardoor969,another needless remake,2,10 October 2005,"I haven't seen the old Amityville in a few years, but I remember it feeling realistic, (for what it was), and actually scaring me at the time. The old version had a certain creepiness that the pretty new version lacked entirely.As another review says, it didn't look like the 70's at all. They made an effort with the clothes, but everyone, and everything was too clean and perfect and shiny. Even when George (Ryan R.) was supposed to be going nuts he looked 'perfect' just needed a few eye drops for his bloodshot eyes.Then, I thought the movie had either entered a dream sequence or that it was actually a spoof and not trying to be serious when the MTV/model baby sitter walks in, in a 70's bikini top... yeah, right, that's believable. On the DVD the writer explains that he didn't put the playboy babysitter in originally but the 'guys in charge' thought it was an excellent opportunity to ""bring in a babe"".Gone was the excellent scene where the couple tries in vain to find the lost money they had saved. Anyone who isn't rich knows how much losing a lot of money in your own house can add to an already heightened stress level on a family, demons or no demons...The scenes they did keep just didn't pack the same type of punch. This priest was attacked by what looked to be a horde of rubber flies and the basement stuff just seemed like it was meant for another movie altogether.The scares were good, but they were short lived... I totally missed that 'creepy feeling' that a horror movie should invite.All that ranted, there wasn't really a point in making or seeing this film, but like the new chainsaw, psycho etc, people just want to make a quick buck without actually creating something original on their own.",The Amityville Horror

Maybe next time Hollywood will not embellish so much!!! Stick to the facts and the story will get 100 times better. There was no John Ketchum....cause history has proved that neither Ketchum nor the did the Indian tribe mentioned in the movie ever have been privy to that long island ground. (do your research!) And the other falsehood the Amityville Horror 2005 made you believe is that Jodie was really Allison Defoe. That is so far from the truth it is actually funny!! Jodie was really a pig that befriended her...and had nothing to do with the deceased DeFoe children!!! Tell Hollywood to get it right and that we aren't listening!!!,The Amityville Horror
532,indracold722,The Amityville Horror - 2005,1,12 October 2005,"The Amityville Horror (2005) remake is based upon the novel of the same name, written by Jay Anson. The screenplay is also based on the screenplay of the 1979 original, by Sandor Stern. The beginning credits indicate this.The beginning of the film also states: Based on a True Story.This is the first inaccuracy, which is shown on the film.The following points are the only accurate pieces of information contained in the remake: 1. In the movie we see that in 1974, Ronald DeFeo Jr murdered his parents, two brothers and two sisters in their home in Amityville, Long Island, New York. We know that DeFeo was subsequently tried and convicted on six counts of second-degree murder, of which he is currently serving six consecutive life sentences.2. In the movie we see that 13 months later George and Kathy Lutz, and their three children from Kathy's first marriage, move into the former DeFeo house.3. In the movie, 28 days later, they flee for their lives.4. Oh yes, in the movie, there is a priest involved.As far as the inaccuracies are concerned, there are so many I refuse to list them on here. The rest contained countless inaccuracies that even did an injustice to the original movie.I must admit that when I went in to see this film I went in with the knowledge that a lot of things put in this movie were going to be embellished or completely inaccurate. It seems to be an unwritten rule that when books are made into film, a lot of what is on the pages of the book don't necessarily get transferred to film format, for reasons that I shall not go into.In the case of The Amityville Horror remake, I think the same rule is applied here, so when I went in to the cinema to view the remake, I went in with not just this knowledge, but also with the knowledge of the real case on which it is supposedly based upon. By the time the end credits appeared my initial suspicions were confirmed  that this ""remake"" was indeed NOT a remake but a ""rehashing"" of an original screenplay and book taken to extremes in the worst possible sense.Let's not forget here that there were six members of a family murdered  a fact the film seems to trivialize.Let's no forget that there was also another family who had invested their lives into a house in which to raise a family in, and had 28 days later fled the house, for reasons that have been mocked and criticized by many people, as well as trivialized by an unscrupulous media.But as long as it grosses big bucks at the box office, those factors don't seem to be taken into account.As a regular haunted house movie, this is without a doubt a movie filled with your usual fanfare of suspense. However as soon as it brandishes it's ""Based on a True Story"" blurb at the start of the film, and then proceeds to feed us this inaccurate garbage, it loses all credibility and therefore puts itself into the annals of the worst horror movie ever made.",The Amityville Horror

Entertainment is moving forward, so should Hollywood's intelligence on how to make a GOOD horror movie. Worth the watch...the first time.

I saw this film 5 times, dragging with me a very scared group of friends who were even more terrified as they walked out.

All they did was make another lame horror movie and slap the name ""Amityville "" on it because it is a proved commodity that horror buffs will instantly recognize the name. (and all the movies after the original AH, which admittedly was not a great movie by anyones standards, were all rip-offs) I'll give it 2 out of 10 stars, only because it did have a few moments where it made a person jump. other wise i would not recommend this movie to anyone. one last thing as a lesson to any director who wants to make a remake: at least make it somewhat like the movie you are ripping off...um, i mean re-making.",The Amityville Horror

Ryan Reynolds played a great George Lutz, and even had the James Brolin thing going on. Sure, it's not the exact same story as the first Amityville ,although it's fairly close, that's what makes it interesting. It's still creepy and supernaturally weird. The original story was fictional and so was this one... this one was just written better. Melissa George did a fine job as Kathy Lutz, Margo Kidder would be proud. Why down a remake anyway, there is plenty of new movies with terrible story lines to pick on. Movie critics are wrong about a lot of great movies and the guy from N.J. is too.

This failed on every level from the terrible pacing, confusing narrative and comical 'scarey bits'....It was unoriginal and obvious in the way a Muppet movie would be and played on every horror cliché in the worst possible way. The characters were fillers.....Completely unbelievable and served only to drag the story screaming to it's conclusion...In the horror genre reality is not a requirement....Feasibilty is !...You only need to suggest it might be possible and your audience will go with you...The film assumes it's audience has never seen any film, horror or otherwise....It took up 90 minutes I my life...I want them back !",The Amityville Horror
540,gtfoley-1,I had a couple hours to waste,2,3 January 2007,"and this fit the bill quite nicely.The acting was uninspiring, contrived, and unoriginal. To mention that this film was based on a true story is not only disingenuous, but downright insulting. The ""facts"" have been proved, long ago, to have been fabricated.The only true fact is that a family was brutally murdered in their sleep for the insurance money by one of their own. As has been pointed out long ago, for the manifestations that the Lutz' claim to have experienced to have really happened, that house would have to have been the object of a multitude of phenomena. All at once. And of course, there would have had to have been one hell of a cleanup waiting for the next owners.But, no family that has lived in the house since then has experienced any paranormal activity.But what makes this version so pathetic is the fact that they didn't try all that hard to bring the character of the house back to life. The house is a Dutch Colonial, with probably 1,700 sq ft. Not a sprawling country farm house.The second thing that killed it for me was the interview with Melissa George where she went on and on and on about how strange it was filming in the house where so much had happened. Maybe the producers should have informed her that the house in Wisconsin where they were filming was a far cry from the home on Ocean Drive in Amityville, Long Island.With such attention to detail, it's no wonder the fine people in the township of Amityville have always refused to let any of these movies be shot in their hamlet.",The Amityville Horror
