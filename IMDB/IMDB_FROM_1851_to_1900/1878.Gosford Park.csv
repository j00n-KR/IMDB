0,TheLittleSongbird,Hugely entertaining,9,9 March 2011,"The beginning is a little slow with occasions when you are not completely sure who the characters are or where the story is going to go. But about twenty-five minutes in, it picks up significantly and the rest is hugely entertaining stuff. The direction is spot on, Robert Altman can be hit and miss, but when he is in the hit category he is very good, which is the case here.I also love Gosford Park for its witty dialogue especially seen with Maggie Smith, its beautiful autumnal setting though I love the cinematography and costumes just as much and the appropriately jazzy score. The story is lovely, with some great whodunit elements and themes such as class and social interaction.The acting is very good. Stephen Fry is delightfully comic, and Ryan Phillippe is also decent. And while Kelly MacDonald does really well in the pivotal role, and Jeremy Northam and Michael Gambon are great value, it is Maggie Smith who steals the show in effortless bitchy mode.Overall, a great and hugely entertaining film and one of Altman's best. I can understand why people mayn't like it, it is not for everyone but if you give it a chance you may find you'll like it. I also recommend Clue and Murder By Death, both focus more on the whodunit side but both are classics as far as I am concerned. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Gosford Park
1,Leofwine_draca,More an exercise in filmmaking than a real film,5,30 January 2011,"What an experience watching the opening credits and seeing name after famous name popping up. A shame the rest of this long-winded movie couldn't equal those giddy heights.After about an hour or so of watching this supposed murder mystery, I realised that Robert Altman wasn't interested in making a mystery film at all. Instead, this is the classic ""upstairs/downstairs"" drama, exploring the interactions between upper class twits and their servants during the 1930s. Anyone who's seen DOWNTON ABBEY, REMAINS OF THE DAY or, indeed, UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS will know what they're getting into here.I was entertained, but not overly so. The film did a good job of getting the different characters interacting, and the twists and humour when they come are good. But the use of a huge cast sacrifices any emotion, leaving this a very cold, technical exercise in filmmaking and something I wouldn't want to experience a second time.",Gosford Park
2,SnoopyStyle,Robert Altman movie,7,11 August 2016,"It's the 30's. Various guests are gathering at English country estate Gosford Park for a hunting weekend. Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) arrives with her servant Mary MacEachran (Kelly Macdonald). Actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) arrives with American vegetarian film producer Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) and his valet Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe). Lady Sylvia McCordle (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) are the hosts with their daughter Isobel. There are also Lady Sylvia's sisters, Louisa, Lady Stockbridge, and Lady Lavinia Meredith with their husbands Raymond, Lord Stockbridge, and Commander Anthony Meredith. There are also Freddie Nesbitt and wife Mabel, Lord Rupert Standish and his friend Jeremy Blond. The help includes butler Jennings, George, and Elsie (Emily Watson). Secrets are revealed by the upstairs and downstairs interactions. Someone is murdered and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) investigates.Like many Robert Altman movies, this has an avalanche of characters. I'd be lying if I say that I followed everyone and everything. It's a big task to keep everyone's story straight. It does have a compelling flow through everything. Kelly Macdonald is the eyes through which I see this movie. The acting power is vast. The cinematography is beautiful. The plot does ramble as Altman movie does but it's the endless supply of characters that make it compelling.",Gosford Park
3,Hitchcoc,An Acquired Taste,8,7 April 2006,"I plan on seeing this again sometime. Perhaps I will offer a more extensive review. With Robert Altman, there are so many layers, so many characters, that knowing the plot and the connectedness will make a reviewing fun. As it is, I had a hard time staying tuned to all the activities and secrets. There was a certain drone, but then I started to be drawn in to the complexity of all of this. As with most mysteries, especially the English manor mysteries, we have first to wade through the pecking order of the persons involved. We need to have an eye for the British caste system. People are born into arrogance. People are born into poverty. Things stay the same. So when these lines are crossed, it creates a lot of difficulty. Like an Anne Perry novel, the role of women is a particular problem because they are raised for other things than to govern or command. I felt that the performances were masterful and subtle. The people cruel and distant. Hiding baggage seems to be the norm and this must be waded through. Once over, go back and watch it again, and watch it unfold, as if you were one of those mystery readers that begins with the last page.",Gosford Park
4,kosmasp,Whodunnit Throwback,7,7 May 2021,"First things first: Top cast, very well acted and well directed and shot. And yet the pacing of it all and the setting (30s, one location, rich people mostly) might not be as enticing to some viewers than it is to others. There is no denying that this has many great actors in it and I enjoy them all. And yet there were quite a few moments where I felt i couldn't be bothered.Usually I'd say those of you who like watching trailers, do it and see if this is something for you. I'm not sure a trailer could do that in this case. What is a measure you can apply: if you know the director you may have an idea if this is going to be something you might like or not. Robert Altman is a genius behind the camera, but since we all have things we like and things we don't ... there is no judging if he is not in your top list of directors. It's a taste thing.Having said that, be prepared for slow pacing and an incident that rocks the world the character live in, but there was already much wrong with that world way before that. Very well drawn characters and relationships ... and a time period that lents itself to this type of story - the way Altman likes to tell it.",Gosford Park
5,classicsoncall,"""Perhaps the butler did it.""",10,14 April 2012,"Knowing this was a murder mystery, it was perhaps an hour into the film and it seemed like absolutely nothing was going on, yet I found myself oddly captivated by the characters and relationships on display. I'm a rather laid back guy who isn't much impressed by the snootiness of socialites and those who think they're better than the rest. So it's rather revealing to be a voyeur into this 1930's world of English royalty and see that, you know what, they're really no better than the rest.As a movie fan, I was also quite intrigued with the constant movie references, and was quick to recognize Ivor Norvello's name as an actor of the era who appeared in the film mentioned in the story. In fact, just like the murder victim here, the real Norvello actually did it twice! The first time was for Hitchcock in a 1927 silent picture - it's actual title ""The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog"". Five years later, Norvello reprised his original role in the first talkie remake of The Lodger titled ""The Phantom Fiend"". For me it's a toss-up choosing between the two, as they each have somewhat different endings for essentially the same story.What's really cleverly done here is the actual murder itself. Though the identity of the killer we see is kept under wraps, it's not until the story progresses that we learn that Sir William McCordle was already dead by the time he was 'stabbed to death'. As intriguing as the story is up to that point, it gets even more mysterious on the way to revealing the real participants in the crime and their relationship to each other.Obviously this won't be every movie viewer's cup of English tea, as it plays out over a two hour span, and as mentioned earlier, nothing really seems to go on until the pheasant hunt and the eventual murder. However if you have some patience, you'll be rewarded with an insider's view of life both upstairs and downstairs as it were, and see just how catty both the upper and lower crusts can be. All as a backdrop for a stylish whodunit in a grand setting. Charlie Chan would have been proud.",Gosford Park
6,lee_eisenberg,I was rooting for this for Best Picture.,10,19 February 2006,"In what may be Robert Altman's best movie since ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", a plethora of aristocrats and their servants come to an estate in rural England in 1932 for a hunting party. When a murder takes place, it sets the stage for discovering that there's more to these people than anyone realizes.Obviously, that's a loose description, but I don't want to give away too much. But I will note this scene: when Insp. Thompson (Stephen Fry) is investigating, he says ""Only the people with secrets should be worried."" He doesn't know just how serious he is! This has the definite feel of an Altman movie, namely the overlapping dialogue. I literally have nothing bad to say about ""Gosford Park""; everything about it was done perfectly. Bob Balaban, Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Ryan Philippe, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and everyone else all do a marvellous job with their roles. Moreover, this movie's prominence when it came out gave Altman a chance to take a swipe at George W. Bush. Julian Fellowes took home an Oscar for his screenplay (I was rooting for this movie for Best Picture). And now that the Academy is giving Altman an honorary Oscar at the upcoming ceremony, I think that it affirms everything that I've just said here.When Ryan Philippe starred in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", who ever would have guessed that he would co-star with Miss Jean Brodie a few years later?",Gosford Park
7,jboothmillard,Gosford Park,6,7 September 2005,"From director Robert Altman (MASH, Nashville), this period murder mystery feeling like an Upstairs Downstairs satire it is an all-star classic feeling drama. Set in the 1930's the story takes place in an old fashioned country house, focusing on both the upper class family members and house guests, and also the servants that serve them. It seems many people in the house upstairs and downstairs want a piece of the head of the house and his money, and it seems that someone will go pretty far to get it. It is when the police are called to investigate the head of house's poisoning, and stabbing afterwards, that all members of the house are revealed to have secrets, but which one has the motive for murder?

8,Quinoa1984,"A good Altman flick, not bad yet not great either",8,4 January 2002,"There was nothing much about Robert Altman's latest film Gosford Park to have it up there with films like MASH, The Player or Cookie's Fortune, but that doesn't stop Altman and his usual huge ensemble to have a lot of entertaining fun with Altman and Balaban's original idea transformed by Julian Charnis' fine script.  In 1932 England, a shooting party is being held with a lot of aristocratic guests and Altman here examines the differences (and sometimes similarities) with the aristocrats and the servants and valets living in the same estate. Then the story also sprawls into the realm of murder mystery, but like other Altman films, the characters are paid more attention to than the plot which could be tricky yet it is pulled off making this a stylish, joyous semi-comedy.  Large cast includes the likes of British veterans and newcomers including: Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Derek Jacobi, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Kelly MacDonald (her best performance since Trainspotting), Ryan Phillippe, Stephen Fry, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam and Balaban himself as a movie producer.

9,wes-connors,"Downstairs, Upstairs",9,26 July 2009,"Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"" is not a ""whodunit"" murder mystery - so, don't even try. A second viewing is recommended, but you probably won't be looking for any missed clues. You will also go crazy if you try to keep track the (too) many characters without a scorecard; it's close to impossible, and ultimately distracting. The real story isn't who murdered the victim, but watching Mr. Altman gather a bunch of Great British (in the broadest sense) actors together, to define the word ""haughty"". Let subtleties fly.Upstairs, Maggie Smith (Constance Trentham) goes to the head of the class, delivering writer Julian Fellowes' lines with relish. ""I haven't a snobbish bone in my body,"" she asserts. Downstairs, Helen Mirren (as Jane Wilson) dominates a tight ship; coming from behind, her character makes the definitive plot points. Ryan Philippe (as Henry Denton) sticks out like a sore thumb, which winds up being perfect, actually; he plays on both teams. Kelly Macdonald (as Mary Maceachran) emerges as the quiet guide.Altman is a motion picture Rembrandt.

10,michaelRokeefe,Col. Mustard with the candlestick in the library.,3,4 January 2003,"Is this Robert Altman at his best or worst? GOSFORD PARK is a slow moving all-star murder mystery. A beastly owner of a 1930's British estate is killed during a weekend shooting party and upper crust get together. The movie is very wordy and mostly with bad accents. The murder event is not as important as the attitudes and suspicions between the high class guests and their servants. The cast members dialogue make the movie. You either find this entertaining or pretty lame. Wardrobes and sets are outstanding. Notable among this large cast are: Kristin Scott Thomas, Eileen Atkins, Michael Gambon, Jeremy Northam, Kelly Macdonald, Maggie Smith, Emily Watson and Ryan Phillippe.

11,sunwarrior13,Gosford Park Is Good But Not Great,8,28 September 2012,"Gosford Park is a mystery comedy-drama film that stars an ensemble cast, which includes Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, and Michael Gambon.Aside from that,it also features Charles Dance, Tom Hollander, Natasha Wightman, and Ron Webster.The story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at the English country house, Gosford Park. A murder occurs after a dinner party and the film goes on to present the subsequent investigation into it from both the servants' and the guests' perspectives.It was written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman.Sir William McCordle and his wife Lady Sylvia are a pair of wealthy British socialites who have invited a variety of friends, relatives, and acquaintances to their mansion in the country for a weekend of hunting and relaxation. Among the honored guests are Constance, Lady Sylvia's matronly aunt; Ivor Novello, William's cousin who is also a well-known actor and songwriter; and Morris Weissman, an American film producer who is friendly with Ivor and researching an upcoming project. Observing the proceedings are the domestic staff of the mansion, including imperious butler Jennings (Alan Bates); footmen George and Arthur; Probert, a valet to Sir William; housekeeper Mrs. Wilson; Mrs. Croft, who oversees the kitchen; and Elsie, a maid. Also on hand are the guests' personal servants, including Mary, Constance's maid; Henry, Weissman's valet; and Parks, a butler. While the servants are required to display a high level of decorum, they are expected to be passive observers who do not comment on what they see, though the gossip among them travels thick and fast once they retire to the servants' quarters downstairs. And it turns out that there's plenty worth gossiping about, especially after Sir William turns up dead, and everyone is ordered to stay at the mansion while the police investigate the killing. This is a scintillating comedy-drama and one of Altman's most richly moving and entertaining pictures as contents and style converge smoothly and seductively in this luxuriant period drama that applies Agatha Christie murder-mystery format to a rigorous anatomy of British class structure in the 1930s, with all the who's who in U.K. in the cast.Also,it juggles about thirty different characters, moving them from the upper-class upstairs to the servants' quarters and the movie does so without losing the audience.It is is slow, but it does eventually lead of to a murder,which happens to be the main focus of the film, but at the same time it emphasizes the entangled relationships of everyone in the house. I think that's the reason this film succeeds despite of its negative flaws which makes it at least a good film but not a great one.",Gosford Park

13,jotix100,A whodonit a la Altman,10,10 January 2002,"Robert Altman proves with this film his ability to bring to the screen all the characters in the film, have them interact with one another and maintain our interest in all what's going on, at the same time. Not only does this film has a great script, but it includes virtuoso acting by his English cast. And what cast it is!The visual style of this film is awesome. We feel as though we're intruding on the guests assembled for a weekend in Gosford Park in the England of the 30s. The Altman technique of having characters talk at the same time works very well here. We're like eavesdroppers to all the conversations taking place in the different rooms. We can peek at how the upper classes behave in their natural habitat, as well as how the servants revolve around theirs.
There is not a false note in this film. It involves us thoroughly, as is the case with other Altman pictures. We're afraid not to pay attention, thus missing a bit of dialogue. We are like eavesdroppers on the other side of the screen savoring the antics of the rich and famous.Maggie Smith is brilliant as the impoverish noblewoman that is going through bad times. Michael Gambon strikes the right note with his portrayal of the head of Gosford Park, as does Kristin Scott-Thomas, as his wife.
It was very good to see Alan Bates as the butler. Helen Mirren is incredible as the head of the staff, always in the background, in her thankless job. What a pleasure to see Kelly McDonald, Clive Owens, Derek Jacobi, Eileen Atkins and Emily Watson. They are the devoted servants who keep this household going. All in all, this was one of the best films that came out at the end of 2001, a year that didn't seem to have many interesting films for adults and fans of intelligent moviemaking. Thank you, Mr. Altman!",Gosford Park
14,preppy-3,Agatha Christie meets Robert Altman,7,11 January 2002,"It's 1932 England and murder occurs at a remote country estate with a huge amount of guests.  Who did it?The murder doesn't occur until over an hour into the film and, before that, it's pure Altman.  Characters talking constantly, LOTS of overlapping dialogue...usually I love his films, but I had a hard time getting into this one.  For one thing, all the actors are British (with the sole exceptions of Bob Balaban and Ryan Phillippe--sporting a really stupid Scottish accent) so it's sometimes hard to make it what they're saying.  The first hour contained a lot of dialogue that was simply unintelligible.  After the first hour, I got a handle on the accents and was able to follow it.The murder isn't the main focus--it's mostly about class consciousness (servants and the rich people)--nothing new is said but it's all still very interesting.  The acting helps immensely.  They have a huge gathering of very good British actors.  Emily Watson, in particular, is superb as a very feisty maid.  Maggie Smith is, as always, great--but hasn't she played the mean old rich woman once too often?  Clive Owen is--interesting.  He's certainly good-looking but seems somewhat stiff in his role (although that's how it should be played).  The worst acting is easily from Phillippe--get some acting lessons bud!Also, blessedly, there's no gratuitous female nudity in this film--Altman seems to usually have a thing for having his actresses strip for no good reason--he held back this time.  Why this film has an R rating I can't say. No nudity, no sex, the murder is bloodless and there's no swearing.  So why the R?All in all, not top-notch Altman but still pretty good.",Gosford Park
15,LeonLouisRicci,A Layered Labyrinth Satire on Servitude,8,21 October 2013,"This Film should come with Warnings. Multi-Oscar Nominations and Critical Acclaim send Viewers to this with High Expectations. To be Honest, it is not a Movie for Everyone. It is a Niche of Sorts, like a Slasher Movie, or a David Lynch Film. It should come as no Surprise because throughout Director Robert Altman's Long Career He never made Movies for the Mainstream, although some such as M*A*S*H (1970) and The Player (1992) did become Huge and Popular Successes. But the Anti-Hollywood Altman never made much of an Effort to be ""Accepted"" and was Proud to be ""out-there-somewhere"".This is a Study of the English Caste System with its Hypocrisy and Arrogance on Full Display. The Movie's Movement comes from Acting, Dialog, and Snobs who are Stuffy, Stodgy, and Grandly Grotesque.

His House, as were all such Houses, Gestapo Esque and the Non-Respect and No-Regard for the Servants was Legendary. These People, Altman seems to say, are so Despicable that Assassination is in Order.The Film is a Layered Labyrinth of Characters and Corridors with Dry Humour and Impeccable Design, Masterfully Written, Directed, and Presented.

I waited far too long to see this movie, but Robert Altman never ceases to amaze.  He has as many misses (Dr. T and the Women, Pret-a-Porter) as he does must-sees (Brewster McCloud, Nashville), but he always shows us an aspect of life with his remarkable vision.  A truly outstanding cast complement the sharp screenplay with subtlety through quick glares and raised eyebrows.  This is not an American movie in any sense.  The Brits love to portray Americans as self-centered bumblers and Bob Balaban (co-writer of the script) plays the role wonderfully.  He manages to irritate everyone in the movie and in the audience.  The beautiful part is those that are irritated with him, are just as irritating themselves!  Watch for perfect performances throughout, but especially, Michael Gambon (mean spirited and pompous), Kristin Scott Thomas (a smile that cuts deeply), Maggie Smith (insecurity at its finest) Alan Bates (upstanding living with a deep secret), Helen Mirren (deeply wounded and desperate), Emily Watson (smartest and warmest character), Richard Grant (living for the moment of come-uppance).

It is a murder mystery although the focus is on class. Plot centers upon a hunting party that arrives at the estate. They are observed through the eyes of their ever present servants. There is a murder and director Robert Altman makes everyone a suspect because everyone has a motive. This is remarkable craft by Altman who not only masters mystery elements but also an ensemble of characters that often appear together within the same frame. Altman's previous works include such classics as Nashville and M.A.S.H. Helen Mirren plays the strict head servant who keeps everything in order. Emily Watson is also a servant who gets caught up in an affair. Kelly MacDonald is the one servant who guides viewers through these events. She is portrayed as an innocent who tells of nothing outside of fact. Maggie Smith plays an elderly guest who belts out the funniest lines. Stephen Fry brings great comic relief as an inspector in that Sherlock Holmes tradition. Everyone delivers flawless performances as they interact within each scene and plotted social event. The story is set in 1932 and backed with exquisite art direction and a theme of wealth, class and placement render it one of Altman's greatest achievements. Score: 10 / 10",Gosford Park
20,HotToastyRag,Pre-cursor to 'Downton Abbey',7,2 March 2021,"We all know why Downton Abbey was so popular: it was great! And it brought Upstairs Downstairs to a whole new generation. But the reason it was so timely was because of Gosford Park, written by Julian Fellowes and with an incredibly similar plot. During the early 1930s, a wealthy English family host a hunting party over the weekend, and with all the upstairs-downstairs action, there's hardly any time to notice that a carving knife has gone missing.It's entertaining, and visually beautiful to see the estate and the costumes, but now that there's Downton Abbey for us to sink our teeth into, there's really no point to watch it anymore. There's a butler, footmen, Countesses and Ladies, valets who get up to no good, and Maggie Smith playing nearly exactly the same character. Upstairs, Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas are the hosts. Camilla Rutherford, Jeremy Northam, Charles Dance, Geraldine Somerville, James Wilby, Bob Balaban, and Ryan Phillippe make up the hunting party. Downstairs, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Eileen Atkins, Derek Jacobi, Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Emily Watson, Sophie Thompson, Jeremy Swift, and Richard E. Grant will keep you endlessly entertained.

21,gradyharp,Recipe for Lasting Success,10,5 April 2008,"Take an 'idea' by Bob Balaban and Robert Altman, transform that idea into a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, place Robert Altman in the director's chair, and gather many of the finest actors in England (and the USA), photograph it with Andrew Dunn as cinematographer, and assign the musical score to Patrick Doyle and presto! - out comes a bubbling movie that entertains on every level and makes a lot of statements about class distinction and other prejudices as well. GOSFORD PARK is a gem of a film and only grows better with repeated viewings.Gosford Park is the estate owned by grumpy William McCordle (Michael Gambon), his bored wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas), his frumpy daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), and served by a staff of servants who include the very in control Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the butler Jennings (Alan Bates), and the head of the kitchen Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins). A weekend hunting party is underway and as the guests arrive the dichotomy between the wealthy and the serving class is emphasized. Among the odd assortment of guests (each with a pack of secrets and prejudices) are Maggie Smith, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Bob Balaban, Jeremy Northam, James Wilby, and their valets and servants Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Ryan Phillippe, etc. The servants are incorporated into the staff rooms by the strange Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Swift et al. The arrival evening drops a few hints of problems afoot both among the guests and among the servants. The hunting party is scarred by a minor accident, but the real problem occurs at the dinner following the hunting party - a time when some of the occult problems become more obvious and culminate in the murder of the vile William McCordle. The police are called and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) uncovers some strange evidence that leads to not only the events of the murder but also unveils many of the secrets of both guests and servants. There is a surprise ending that somehow makes all of the characters seem more human than their artificial roles they have assumed.This is a banquet of fine acting and ensemble work and adds such treasures as a series of songs performed by Jeremy Northam with great style as well as unexpected cameos by a large number of lesser known actors.

22,zetes,Vintage Altman,9,30 March 2002,"Gosford Park is indeed one of Robert Altman's best films. Third best of all that I've seen, following Nashville and 3 Women. Still, I am a tiny bit disappointed with it. I was hoping it would be next to Nashville and 3 Women. I'm not sure if it will even remain in the third spot in my mind for too long. It's not as memorable as many of his other films that may not be quite as good. In fact, at this point I feel more of an affinity for his last film, the unfairly despised Dr. T and the Women.Still, one can't at all watch Gosford Park without being amazed at it. It ranks along with the many great European films in this tradition. It is undoubtedly most influenced by Rules of the Game, directed by Jean Renoir in 1939. That film generally ranks at #2 out of every film ever made on the Sight and Sound polls, taken every decade (they're to be taken this year, 2002, for the seventh time since the poll's founding). I don't agree with its high status (refer to my own reviews, three of them, one individual and then two parts of a 1000+ word one, on imdb). I find it wonderful for the most part, but then it utterly falls apart by the end. Other films in the tradition include Ingmar Bergman's Smiles on a Summer Night, Luis Bunuel's Diary of a Chambermaid (incidentally a remake from an American film directed by Jean Renoir, which I have not seen), and, most recently, Thomas Vinterberg's Celebration, aka Dogme 1. These films all play with the relations between the master and servant class in varying degrees. Godford Park is perhaps the most complex in that respect: it gives equal time to both sides, allowing for a lot of character identification. It also contains an enormous cast, as you might expect from Altman, and all of the characters are perfectly developed, also as you might expect. The acting is brilliant. Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith were singled out by Oscar voters, both receiving a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but I don't know how they chose between the two dozen actors and actresses in order to arrive at those two. Everyone is equal to them, and I imagine a lot of the actors who didn't make it were suggested by the Academy members. The direction, of course, is beautiful. It's on par with the rest of Altman - I don't think he's ever directed poorly, even in his ""bad"" films. The score is beautiful. Stephen Altman's production design is miraculous - it was nominated for an Oscar, but defeated by Moulin Rouge!. Moulin Rouge! is merely showy. The production design here is subtle as hell.I do find some fault in the script. Most of it is brilliant. It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. I would have chosen Memento myself, but Gosford Park is nearly as deserving. The dialogue is always spot on, and the plot is fantastic - that is, until the murder. I'm not going to spoil anything, unless you didn't know that there was a murder (sorry if you didn't, but it was in all the ads!). It's just that the murder feels forced - a lot like the murder in Rules of the Game. It just never seems necessary, and what results from it is not as interesting as I would have hoped for. There's also a ton of setup for the murder in the plot, with tons of bottles of poison being shown and the victim nearly getting shot and so forth. And not enough results from it. The mystery is also not interesting. It was much more interesting - and in line with the theme - when the two groups were simply interacting. The explanation doesn't say anything that wasn't already implied, and some of the unforeseen relationships between the characters don't add as much weight to the drama as they are meant to.That's all a rather minor criticism, to tell the truth. It still works, it's just not as strong as I think it could have (or should have) been. Of course, Gosford Park does qualify as one of the best films of the year and a very worthy addition to Robert Altman's stunning cinema. I've seen around a dozen of his films, and, while I really haven't ranked many a 10/10 (only Nashville, very nearly my favorite film, and 3 Women), Altman has the rare distinction of producing a body of work that is actually greater than the sum of its parts. I give Gosford Park a 9/10.",Gosford Park

24,JamesHitchcock,"Complex and Demanding, but Never Boring",8,19 March 2007,"One November weekend in 1932, a group of guests assemble at Gosford Park, the country seat of Sir William McCordle, for a shooting party. During the course of the weekend Sir William is found dead, apparently stabbed to death, in his study. This scenario recalls the classic English country house murder mystery popularised by Agatha Christie. There was a vogue for filming Christie's novels in the seventies and eighties, but today she is widely regarded as quaint and old-fashioned. It was, therefore, something of a surprise to see Robert Altman, a director with a reputation for being forward-looking and experimental, making a film based upon what could easily have been a Christie plot, although Julian Fellowes's screenplay was in fact an original one.Yet in some respect Altman's style is suited to a murder mystery. One of his trademarks is the use of multiple story lines involving a large (and normally all-star) cast, and this fits in well with the traditional murder story, in which it is necessary to establish that there were a considerable number of people with a motive to commit the crime. This is what happens in ""Gosford Park""; there is no one obvious suspect because Sir William was a highly unpleasant individual and most of the people present in the house had good cause to dislike him. (For example, he had threatened to cut off the allowance paid to his sister Lady Constance).That does not mean, however, that the film is a pastiche of the likes of ""The Mirror Crack'd"" or ""Evil under the Sun"". The first half of the film is taken up with introducing the characters and establishing the relations between them. Whereas the traditional murder mystery concentrates very much on the relations between the eventual murder victim and those persons who will later be suspected of his or her murder, in ""Gosford Park"" there is a much more complex web of interrelationships. This enables Fellowes to concentrate not only on those ""upstairs""- the McCordle family and their guests- but also on those ""downstairs""- the servants who work in the basement. (Interestingly, one of the servants is played by Eileen Atkins, one of the creators of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", a well-known British TV series from the seventies which also portrayed life in a wealthy household and in which the servants also played as important a role as their master and his family).The social structure revealed in this film is a complicated one. For all his baronial pretensions, Sir William's wealth derives from his ownership of factories in the London suburbs, something which in the eyes of the traditional landed aristocracy and gentry would be enough to damn him as ""new money"". (We learn that in his younger days he was a notorious sexual predator, preying on his factory girls, and his habit of fondling attractive young female servants suggest that he has not changed his ways in old age). We see the arrival of an even newer moneyed class in the persons of Ivor Novello (who was a real-life actor, singer and composer of the period) and Morris Weissman, an American film producer in England to learn something of country house life in preparation for a film he is making. (Ironically, also a murder mystery). It is not only life upstairs that has a hierarchical structure; the servants' hall has a hierarchy of its own, in which a valet outranks a footman but is outranked by a butler.Another difference between this film and the traditional whodunit is that there is no omniscient detective to act as a ""Deus ex machina"" and resolve the mystery at the end. Unlike, say, Hercule Poirot, Stephen Fry's policeman is a minor, and rather comic, figure. It is a much more unlikely character who actually solves the mystery.The film's cast list reads like a ""Who's Who"" of the British acting profession. There is not space enough here to praise all those who deserve it, but I must single out exceptionally fine contributions from Maggie Smith as Lady Constance, Helen Mirren as the housekeeper, Kelly Macdonald as the Scottish maid, Alan Bates as the drunken butler Jennings, and Clive Owen as Robert Parks, a young man who harbours a long-standing grudge against Sir William.The film also features another of Altman's trademark devices, the use of overlapping conversations. I have never been a great admirer of this device, but in ""Gosford Park"", however, it seems to work, making for greater realism without (as it sometimes does) sacrificing comprehension. Altman and Fellowes succeed in taking a traditional, often hackneyed, genre, and putting it to fresh use, both as a character study of a diverse group of characters and as an exploration of social issues. The result is a complex and often demanding film. Unlike some reviewers, however, I never found it a boring one. 8/10",Gosford Park
25,StevePulaski,The mark is left,8,15 September 2013,"My emotions fervently cycled watching Robert Altman's Gosford Park. For the first half-hour, I found myself struggling to engage with the very loose narrative, eclectic characters, and dry, relatively ordinary conversations that lacked commonality or relatability on my behalf. After half-an-hour or so, Altman's motives became more clear to me. After an hour and a half, they were beyond crystal. Then the last forty-eight minutes became something of a slog for the mind and the heart.Altman's grandscale film will wow some people, bore others, alienate, detach, enchant, invigorate, and intrigue - some, like me, will experience all of those at least once - in its 138-minute runtime. A film like this deserved praise alone because its craft will be disposed of by some or justified and cherished by others. I doubt two will have the same ideas after viewing the picture as well. It's the kind of film where while you're watching it, you're already planning when you'll see it next.The film's story seems conventional and relatively cheap material, until Altman's intentions and direction becomes more vivid. It depicts a large gathering of wealthy Britons and their servants at the luxurious country house named ""Gosford Park."" Actors such as Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, and Clive Owen portray these people, as they gather for a lavish weekend of shooting a film. However, if social classes and net worth weren't the only thing from dividing many of them, a murder occurs in the country house, leaving guests scrambling and searching for the killer and a possible motive. It doesn't help that half the house already hates another half of the house for some reason or another either.It took me about half an hour - well before the first murder event occurs - to realize the film attempts to show the mannerisms, behavior, and social classes of a large, selected group of Britons as they gather together for a weekend of enjoyment that turns into calamity. Altman has little interest in making this film a murder mystery or a film that relies heavily on clues. It's not about piecing it together; rather, it's about embracing culture and existing as a class-study, if anything.I feel that if you don't recognize this at some point during the film - or even before seeing it - your experience will be a boring and rather uneventful one. Because of this stylistic and rather meticulous focus added to the story, Gosford Park is sort of a challenge to watch even after you recognize it. However, it's a beautiful piece in regards to the acting and the slowburn writing, which many directors and writers would undoubtedly find a task to do. Altman doesn't really care if you agree with methods of storytelling; I'm not even sure he cares if you watch them. He wants to make his mark and go from there. His mark is definitely made with Gosford Park.Starring: Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Richard E.

Turning the audience into voyeurs, the camera spys on the manor staff as and guests exploring the crusty to the commoner from boudoir to billiard room with endless banter and repartee.

27,MovieAddict2016,Very disappointing.,5,9 May 2005,"Robert Altman is one of my favorite directors of all time and his ""Player"" (1992) starring Tim Robbins is a great dark satire of the film industry. He's a great genre-swapper and so I expected quite a bit from ""Gosford Park,"" which I pictured as an Agatha Christie-style period piece.The movie stars Weese Ritherspoon's husband, Ryan Phillipe, from ""Cruel Intentions."" That should say something about its acting right off the bat -- mediocre, to say the least. There are a few fine performances, but the bad ones drag them all down.The ""mystery"" elements of the story are very poor. Instead of building up an atmospheric thriller Altman examines the characters like he's doing ""Nashville Redux"" or something -- no offense but I didn't go see this to see a realistic depiction of different classes of society in a mansion, I went to go see a murder mystery as was promised on the ads and in that respect I was sorely disappointed.Overall I'd have to say this is one of Altman's weakest and most pretentious films -- it's a huge disappointment and a rather banal example of Altman's typically reliable directorial style.Non-fans of Altman might like it, but I suspect most of his die-hard followers will find it a dubious title in his resume.",Gosford Park
28,sddavis63,It Put Me To Sleep - Three Times,2,10 August 2002,"Having heard many good things about it, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but having seen it, I'm not sure where the good reviews came from.Folks, this movie is boring. There's no other word for it. It's supposed to be a murder mystery, yet you have to struggle through at least two thirds of the story before anyone is killed. Instead, the characters get developed. And developed. And developed. Not that any of them are especially interesting - but they need to be developed apparently. And developed. And developed. Sorry, I've mentioned that they get developed, haven't I? And developed ....I struggled to stay awake through the whole thing (and lost the battle at least three times.) There's a positive thing about this: it's a guaranteed cure for insomnia. I missed the end (I had fallen asleep) but my viewing companions told me that the end made no more sense than anything else in this turkey.The only thing I liked? I thought Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) was quite funny. I'll grant that much. But for his small part in the movie, it's not worth the effort.2/10",Gosford Park
29,cherold,low key but interesting,7,11 June 2004,"While Robert Altman has always been a critical darling, I've found most of his films pretty mediocre, with the very, very occasional exception. I would consider Gosford Park to be one of those exceptions. It's a surprisingly well-mannered movie from Altman, less of the chaotic, improvised mess that so enamors the critics and annoys me, although as in almost every Altman movie I've seen it can be difficult to understand what people are saying sometimes (I always thought it was because he likes a lot of background noise in his movies, but Gosford is quiet and genteel so I think he just has a bad sound recordist (I thought it was just me until I saw another review here complaining about the same thing). But as I say, in spite of some murky sound this is nicely filmed (something about England apparently tames Altman's proclivity for the jittery camera and casual lighting) and quite reminiscent of Upstairs Downstairs, for those of you who were fans of that British series. While the PR people decided to market this as a murder mystery, the murder happens late in the proceedings and doesn't really have that much to do with the movie, so if you're looking for Agatha Christie you'll be disappointed. This is rather a look at the weird symbiotic relationship of servants and their employers. It's really more about the servants and how their lives go on; they know everything that goes on upstairs, while the upper class is fairly oblivious to pretty much everything.While the movie is a typical Altman ensemble piece, some performers stand out, most notably Maggie Smith, whose arrogant and intelligent grand dame is the most entertaining character of the bunch. Helen Mirren is also quite effective in a less flashy role. While it's a bit slow moving at times I quite enjoyed it, rating it 7/10.",Gosford Park
30,MOscarbradley,The body in the library is virtually irrelevant,10,10 December 2006,"A masterpiece. Robert Altman cut his teeth on big, multi-layered ensemble pieces like ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts"". Even his break-through film, ""MASH"", had a large number of characters and discordant stories running through it as well as an almost blatant disregard for conventional narrative. Still, you might have been forgiven for thinking that a British country house melodrama complete with body in the library and set in 1932 was beyond his range. Far from it. This wonderfully quick-witted movie is quite the equal of his very best work. The humour is certainly there in Julian Fellowes' script and the murder plot is something on an old chestnut, (the denouement is almost something of an irrelevance). What matters is the detail and Altman gets it right with an almost documentary-like precision. He is equally adept in dealing with the vagaries of those upstairs and down, (there is a pecking order among the servants, too), in a way that would not have disgraced Renoir. Indeed the film is at its best when picking away at the social mores, not just of the rich and their snobbish attitude to 'new' money but of those who serve them, (servants judge servants as much as by who they are and where they come from as their masters).In this, of course, Altman is greatly helped by his magnificent cast. It would be insidious to single any one performer out from another, so I won't, suffice to say that down to the tiniest part this is an extremely well-acted film. And like the best of Altman's work there is a wonderfully improvisatory feel to Julian Fellowes' screenplay. The original idea was Altman's and the actor Bob Balaban's, who also appears in the film. For the sake of entertainment they give us some broad comedy and a silly murder mystery by way of Agatha Christe presided over by a bumblingly daft Inspector of Clouseau-like incompetence played by Stephen Fry. But you know instinctively that this is not the real reason for ""Gosford Park"". This is a precise and stingingly accurate piece of social history. I can't think of another director who could have pulled it off other than, maybe, Lindsay Anderson who seems to have been au fait with both sides of this particular coin. Anderson might have got it right but I doubt if he would have bettered it.",Gosford Park
31,dromasca,Unsatisfying,7,28 April 2003,"I never liked Robert Altman's movies. My main problem is that they fail to build a real satisfying cinema experience. Yes, they are complex and try to say more than the average movie. Yes, there is a lot of good social comment to follow. Yes, I can like a movie even if the action is not in the focus of its director or script writer. The problem is that altogether, Altman's movies are - for me - hard to watch, and I get too little emotion back for the intellectual effort to watch them. And yet, 'Gosford Park' is better than the 'crowd' of Altman's films. It is set in England between the wars and it chooses as a setting a high class manor that is the scene of many classical Agatha Christie crime stories. There is even a murder to solve, though it does not seem to be in the focus of the director. What is in focus is the class relationship between masters and servants and whoever knows the British society knows that this is an important aspect of the British life until today. A multitude of superb actors, most of them British do their usual fine job, and it is always a delight to watch Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, or Emily Watson in action.
But, but... all is unfortunately lost in the never-ending verbage, in the confusing camera work which may be the delight of critics but never helps the viewer to better understand the message. The European and certainly British viewers have many BBC TV films who succeed at least as well, or even better to recreate the atmosphere and may enjoy similar (or same!) teams of fine actors. No need for Altman to cross the Ocean to do this film. 7/10 on my personal scale.",Gosford Park
32,ThomasDrufke,One Weekend in England,6,19 May 2019,"As big of a film buff as I am, I've never seen a Robert Altman film until Gosford Park, so perhaps I didn't really know what I was in for. For a murder mystery thriller, GosFord Park is paced unusually slow, and rather than showing the audience anything for character development, the film instead decides to give it all to us via dialogue. Which, in certain instances can be a good thing, but exposition only goes so far. I felt as though too often the film was obsessed with putting 20 characters (you hardly know) in a room together to keep us guessing on who committed said crime (which doesn't even happen until over an hour in) and not on developing the actual story around those characters. But it's also one of those times where a second watch may improve the viewing experience a bit, perhaps.

33,secondtake,A movie-making masterpiece with an excess of niggling plot details.,7,4 January 2010,"Gosford Park (2001)Robert Altman is an amazing director in love with making movies of complexity and inner integrity. But he sometimes loses hold on the basic storytelling and emotional aspects of a film, losing at least part of the viewer's involvement. That's no small flaw, in the end, and Gosford Park, like The Player, is both admirable and cold, virtuosic and needlessly busy and clever. So watch it for the details more than the plot, which is smart enough if you can keep up with all the details, some more pertinent than others. The mise-en-scene is utterly convincing (and house or houses used for shooting is beyond perfect for it). The class structure, and the interplay between classes, is played with constantly, and with wit. The blocking of scenes (the movement of characters in the space) is complex and involving. And the camera-work is subtle and beautiful, and varied. Note how often the camera moves just slightly toward, and around, an actor being singled out, giving a fluidity to watching. Indeed, this could have been a really horrible movie, a bore, a confusing morass. But it is so well made it is worth watching, and maybe, for a film student, worth studying. The acting, on top of it all, is superb, Clive Owen and his confident diffidence not the least of the great roles.But the distractions persist. The annoying and oddly inconsequential American, for one of several characters who might better have been left out. And why all the subplots between some of those ""upstairs"" meant to recreate the haughty snobbery of the scene but little else?

In fact, as I got into the film I actually thought that whether one was talking about the upper class or the servants, I was so glad for the Revolutionary War separating us from the mother country! Second, it's waaaaaay too loooooooooooooong. You can easily separate this film into two parts -- pre and post murder. The pre-murder portion -- about half the movie -- could have been cut in half. The post-murder portion of the movie is somewhat interesting, but 2 hours and 17 minutes was simply too long.Third, and related to the previous item...it's very slow and plodding, and reminded me of British films of the past that crawled along at a snail's pace.Fourth, can't the Brits do anything but mumble? Oddly enough, the cast is quite interesting. Too bad the characters they played weren't interesting, as well. Here you have fine actors such as Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, and Maggie Smith in roles that are just plain boring with very little character development.

Everything is perfect here, the polyphony is driven to extremes without ever falling out of control, the music, chiefly by Ivor Novello, adds to the authenticity of 1932, all the best actors of twenty years ago are present, all actually acting minor roles with mostly only petty talk about trivialities, but gradually a structure emerges of complicated relationships, repressed frustrations, scandals of the past suddenly being refreshed like reappearing most unpleasant ghosts, and towards the end as a result the main protagonists breaking up in agonies of despair. There is a great tragedy here but it is hidden, and when it finally appears it is relentlessly restrained behind closed doors, and none of the outrageous secrets are let out, although too many are too well aware of them. Maggie Smith is phenomenal as the grand old lady, while Helen Mirren gives the most interesting and impressing performance, as a victim of a mother who lost her son from the beginning.

39,Dr_Coulardeau,A vicious and thrilling social criticism of British aristocracy,10,2 June 2007,"Well played and pleasant but absolutely sinister. D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover in reverse. Lady Chatterley is in fact a Lord. And everything is different. The Lord has the right to have as many affairs with the female servants as he wants. He has the right to have as many children with these female servants as he wants and then to have the babies abandoned and sent to orphanages. Absolutely disgusting. And what's more he may keep the servants for further use eventually. When we know that we know the murder of the Lord will be accepted by everyone in his own social class as justified, that they will cover it up for the police not to find out the murderer. And what's more they will have been backboneless enough not to murder him themselves and let the servants murder him. Here Robert Altman imagines a thriller that becomes a vicious denunciation of the deepest hypocrisy you can imagine, that of the British aristocracy. There is little to add to this tale, except that all in all only the servants have the human dignity that provides them with some human feelings, including for the son that has managed to survive and is condemned to remain officially unknown. It is also the servants who have the liking and taste for the Hollywood sentimental and sentimentalese songs that are sung for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen who treat that music as some charming accompaniment for their simmering hatred of the world and themselves. Of course Altman also manages to put one note against the Americans in the two characters from California, one having a typically non-Anglo-Saxon name, viz. Weissman. They are vicious enough to infiltrate the servant quarters just for the sake of a film on the very same situation, hence to guarantee the realism of the servants' side of the film. But they are also gross enough to reveal the subterfuge before the end and that reveals too how much the servants hate this indiscretion that reveals their side of ,the household to someone from the other side of the household. The gap between the two social classes that live along to one another in this mansion is wider than the distance between the earth and the moon.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Gosford Park

Hold on a minute, there was a library in Cluedo, wasn't there? There's no library in the Gosford Park house. At least, I didn't see one... Whatever, the point being that there is a murder at the core of this lavish, period piece from 2001 and a handful of people of varying genders; backgrounds; nationalities and classes all caught up in this stately locale facing down the barrel of a charge. Alas, I wanted to like the film more than I did; eventually finding myself to be worn down by the film's run time and its excessive amount of characters depicted therein, where in the past I have often taken to Altman projects feeding off such things. And yet it doesn't have any right to often be as engaging as it sometimes is - unlike a game of Cluedo, the death at the heart of Gosford Park is inconsequential; it is ultimately about the people and the talking, the dialogue driven scenes depicting a bygone British class system nattering away about not much in particular but doing well to side us with the perspective of a young female maid engaging with her infirm, snobbish elderly boss. I wanted a film about them. In a sense, we get one; in another sense, it isn't anything to do with them. The imbalance is cause for frustration.Dignitaries of all sorts and of differing ilks are gathering at a huge country estate in 1930's England; they're there for a weekend of hunting and whatnot at the behest of their host, Michael Gambon.

He likes to shoot birds for sport; enjoys the presence of the young female maids at his home (especially when they're wearing what they wear) and isn't generally much in the way of a bang-up guy. The ship that is the manor house is run so tightly under his watch, that should certain maids be caught on the incorrect storey, severe ramifications would unfold.All is not well away from the host and his friends either. Within certain couples staying at the lodge for the duration, arguments are arising and there is a general sense of both distrust and unease amongst everyone as this disparate congealed unit consisting of this body of personnel gear up for exquisite dinners; rich company and the pleasures that apparently come with being able to go out on a hunt and shoot stuff: the sort of things that need to run smoothly so as to even have a hope of working. A good deal of it does consist of people both sitting and standing around; talking, eating, arguing and switching between their public personas and private personas: faces and attitudes their friends know them for, as well as such things for which their closer peers know them. When the time comes for Gambon's character to die at the bereft of one of those present, there is room for most to be a suspect; in spite of Altman's guile to cut to a specific few people looking shifty and suspicious as they re-enter the lounge wherein everybody congregated away from the crime scene.For most, the idea of a film wherein a lone murder doesn't have to, or need to, constitute as the focal point around which the entire film must hinge will sound like a masterstroke of film-making; pacing, et al. I found it engaging without being riveting, a matter of style over substance for a great deal of its time. The film is more a snapshot of what a smattering of folks, typical to 1930's Great Britain, at a manor retreat for a weekend of hunting and fine dining might resemble. The rummaging around for a narrative; an event: anything gives way to something as jarring as a death that's not even the focal point of the piece in the first place. We don't mind this, of course, but apart from Kelly Macdonald's scenes with her elderly employer, played by Maggie Smith, we are scrapping around for scant consolation in terms of plot and character, with these specific sequences becoming beacons upon which we grasp for any kind of interest. Macdonald is better than what her job says she is: someone curious where curiosity in a young woman is frowned upon; someone outgoing and looking to engage, someone working for Smith's character not out of respect or because Smith can boss her around with consummate ease (although she does), but because she comes cheap. There is an amusing self-aware, sub-""The Player"" skit nearer the beginning of the film, arriving in the form of an American character pitching an idea for a detective story which eerily begins to sync up with what's transpiring before everyone: something with a similarly subversive idea to that of The Player, but not unfolding in a film quite as good. Ah yes, The Player: THERE was a film.",Gosford Park

Typical of Robert Altman, the film has a naturalistic 'busy' look, with overlapping dialogue and sometimes the characters can be bit had to follow but the ensemble cast is outstanding and the story an intriguing 'manor-house mystery' that avoids excessive gimmicky red-herrings. Stephan Fry is particularly amusing as an oblivious and incompetent police inspector paired with an observant and competent, and constantly ignored, constable (Ron Webster).

42,meeza,Not Classy Enough For Me!,6,24 January 2002,"Director Robert Altman's `Gosford Park ` is being called by many critics as one of the best films of the year.  But in my opinion, `Gosford Park' is melting in the park.  And I do not know how long it took to make it, but I hope director altman never has that recipe again.  Ok! Sorry Donna! `Gosford Park' is an upstairs/downstairs tale set in a British countryside mansion.  The film focuses on the social elite british snobbery upstairs and the unfulfilled gossipy servants downstairs.  At the same time, there is a murder mystery involved in all this chaos.  Director Altman did do a formidable job in serving us a well-paced direction.  However, what I thought should have been maid better was the unsettling screenplay. As you might also be, I found myself a bit lost in `Gosford Park'. *** Average",Gosford Park
43,CubsandCulture,Altman Showing Off...,10,30 August 2018,"Altman is my favorite director ever and pretty much every one of his films is a favorite. For a very long time Gosford Park (the first film of his I saw) was a my favorite film ever. It has recently been supplanted for the very top spot but my fondness for it hasn't diminished. This is the perfect Altman film and in a lot of ways the joys of the film is simply his showing off skill. There is 15 or so major characters, 6 or so plotlines and about 20 more of each in the supporting role. A lot of this is in the tightly plotted and very economically written screenplay by Fellowes but in any other director's hands the film would have been a muddled mess. The attentive viewer is able to follow *everything* of import on the first viewing and on each viewing additional shades of meaning become apparent. It's simply amazing how the pieces fit together. But that really doesn't matter because the broad strokes of the manor house society are entirely apparent just by how the characters move and behave. I'm not British, and I'm certainly not rich, but I understood *why* Elsie speaking out of turn was such a big deal, or why she would receive a good recommendation in spite of it. So yes the attentive viewer will realize that Isobel is pregnant with Freddie's child but all viewers will get how Isobel's autonomy is restrained by expectation placed on upper-class women. The amount of information and the ease with which is conveyed is amazing.The film is a comedic broadside mocking murder mysteries. It's a thoughtful exploration of class and economics. It explores gender and sexuality in a natural way. It has acidic wit at capital and anger over the studio system in Hollywood. The film has something to say no matter what lens you put over it.Altman's fluid camera work, the camera is almost never still, as well his noirish lighting gives the film a somber, cynical energy that both romanticizes country living and mocks it. Altman makes the film funny, and sad. It's bittersweet defined.Of course, the acting is great. Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren got a lot of attention back in 2001. They deserve it. But, Clive Owen was sinister and mysterious, but also thoughtful and wistful. He made the most of his 20 or so minutes. Likewise, Emily Watson is simply great, determined, strong and self-reflective. This is a lot of wisdom is Elsie.",Gosford Park
44,Chris_Docker,Effortlessly impressive,8,26 February 2002,"Now in his late 70s, director Robert Altman shows us he can still churn out a very fine movie with seeming effortlessness.  A delightful Agatha-Christie type period piece set in a country manor - a sort of ""dinner at eight, murder at twelve"" type formula. Altman's characteristic long panning shots and dialogue that drifts in and out relax us into feeling like one of the most pampered flies-on-the-wall in all existence. Add to that a collection of some of the finest actors, every one of them radiating brilliant performances, and the actual murder whodunnit is of almost secondary interest to the detailed goings on of everyday life amongst the gentry and servants. Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Stephen Fry, Kelly McDonald, Maggie Smith. The list goes on - you couldn't squeeze much more top notch talent into a single movie. The perhaps rather sad thing is that the subject matter is so insubstantial that its reach is so much further than its grasp. Lord of the Rings will live on when class acts like this will be revered but only watched by cinefiles.",Gosford Park
45,noralee,Brilliant Acting! Brilliant Writing! Brilliant Directing!,10,20 December 2005,"It's not just because I have seen virtually every Merchant-Ivory/A & E/BBC/PBS costume drama and period mystery and spent a summer in junior high reading every Agatha Christie mystery that I think ""Gosford Park"" is terrific.Robert Altman commissioned Juilian Fellowes (""Lord Angus"" for ""Monarch of the Glen"" fans so of course he could also advise on etiquette during filming) for a script with very specific guidelines to work within the bounds of a genre satire. (We are spared one of the usual easy target pickings, the Fascist sympathies of the aristocracy, by fixing the shooting party weekend as taking place very specifically in 1932.)The ensemble character acting and camera movement are simply masterful -- with Altman's mandate that we only see scenes that the ""downstairs"" folk pass through or are in, equating them with the spying camera, and us, too, of course. If these names weren't already a Who's Who of British (and two American) actors, each of their key scenes would be one of those ""star making"" break-outs. In an interview Altman noted that he intentionally made most of the biggest stars ""downstairs,"" though our guide through the very confusing relationships ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" is a newcomer, Mary Macdonald (interestingly the first actress cast for the film), representing the audience. Roger Ebert pointed out how key the performance is of another relative newcomer, Claudie Blakley as a put-upon parvenu, in putting the relationships into relief, particular the changes the weekend has wrought on the participants. While Maggie Smith seems to stand out because her character is noisier, a fellow actress protested in an interview that Smith did not in fact get the best lines -- she just did more with them -- like what she does to the phrase ""day-old marmalade."" Spotlighting particular performances could be endless -- though of course I got a kick out of two of my favorites, Clive Owen, who fairly radiates sexuality here, and Ryan Phillippe, playing for both teams, plus Richard Grant's smirks are priceless. Helen Mirren is startlingly different than so many of her other roles.The class differences even amusingly extend to the investigating policemen. The inclusion of Bob Balaban as a Hollywood producer (and co-producer of this movie) also opens up the film to Hollywood and American jokes. The movie is really laugh out loud funny, and the full house I saw it with really got into it, particularly the visual jokes and overheard lines. It quickly spins serious as the camera restlessly glides throughout the house -- the actors had to stay in character throughout all the scenes, adding chitchat to the script, as they had no idea where the camera would be. Until the credits, I had no idea that Ivor Novello was a real songwriter, sung and played here charmingly by Jeremy Northam, and the characters' various reactions to his typical pop music of the day are a key element to the film.Three cheers to a 76-year-old director! Experience can count.(originally written 1/20/2002)",Gosford Park
46,myriamlenys,"Agatha Christie's world, reviewed and revisited for a modern audience",7,3 October 2017,"A sharp, almost merciless criticism of English aristocracy circa 1930 (give or take a year or so). This is an homage to the world of the Great Dame, although an homage with an unusually astute and satirical bite. The movie dissects the English upper class with all the methodical coldness of a vivisectionist, and the results aren't pretty : it becomes clear that concepts like ""patriotism"", ""tradition"" or ""inheritance"" are just convenient smokescreens behind which the powerful rich bamboozle and exploit the powerless poor.Still, I'd like to point out (and this might come as a bit of a surprise to the makers of the movie) that one doesn't have to be English, rich and/or aristocratic in order to be decadent. A few decades ago a friend of mine, who is a tax inspector of a specific kind, paid a routine visit to a citizen, in order to verify his activities and administration. Within the space of an hour, she discovered a) that the man ruled a live-in harem of women from Vietnam or Thailand (""my tiny ivory beauties"") b) while carrying on with both male and female neighbors. The man also had a large number of relatives, step-relatives and in-laws, most of whom were involved in illicit relationships of stunning complexity. The said citizen tried to ply my friend with cognac, ecstasy and weed ; eventually he became so insistent that she had to flee through a kitchen door. We're not talking British barons here, we're talking small-town artisans in Belgium. But I digress. Judged as a mystery or detective movie, ""Gosford Park"" might have benefited from some additional twists or red herrings. The movie boasts a dream cast, but that doesn't mean that all performances are stellar : the quality is uneven, ranging from superb to ""God, what am I doing here, I'll just try to wing it for a couple of days and then it's back to home sweet home in order to fire my agent"". (Stephen Fry seems particularly lost.) On the other hand, the various locations, costumes and props are delightful and convincing. Trampling on the faces of the innocent has rarely looked so good.",Gosford Park
47,alansabljakovic-39044,Great cast but fails to deliver,5,13 June 2020,"Altman really knows how to handle a large cast but fails again to deliver great execution and solid ending. The camera work in his movies is always on the highest level and that's what I loved about him. This is supposed to be a whodunnit but instead we got an hour of rich english people ,who I can't even remember name of (there are like 1000 names and I didn't know who was who at the end), talking and drinking. When the murder finally happened it was pretty obvious who did it and Altman dedicated too little time to that part of the film.

This rates above ""Ready to Wear"" and ""A Wedding"" but beneath the aforementioned and ""The Player"" and ""Images"".  Cast is a huge plus but for me the standouts were Ryan Phillippe and Clive Owen.  Clive is especially important to the plot so I was glad he was able to stand out, somewhat, from his co-stars.  I didn't enjoy Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren nearly as much as I normally do.  Mirren was in ""Greenfingers"" with Clive and was a total delight in that little-seen masterpiece and much more enjoyable there.  I can see why Jennifer Connelly pretty much won all the Supporting Actress awards last year, at least compared w/these two performances.Its not that its a bad movie, its just not that great.  Its at least 1/3 hour too long and not the 'whodunit' I was expecting.  I wish there was a 'whodunit' that gave the audience an actual chance to figure out 'who' without being a mindreader.

49,ShootingShark,"Badly Written, Overacted And Insufferably Snooty Rubbish",3,5 June 2005,"One weekend in 1932, various family members, guests and celebrities gather at the house of Sir William McCordle, but the party is adjourned when he is found murdered.I bloody well hate costume-dramas; nothing ever happens, I can never identify with any of the characters and they're always interminably long and boring. This one tries to make itself more interesting by adding a murder plot, but it's so lame and shoddily executed it makes the movie even worse. Its chief technique is to divide the cast into the gentry in their elegant drawing-rooms and their servants in the dusty hallways beneath, which would be an original idea if it didn't happen to be the main theme of the (much superior) seventies television series Upstairs Downstairs. This device serves as an excuse for over two hours of people gossiping about each other whilst nothing happens and overrated actors ham it up with hackneyed props and eccentricities (Gambon has a spoilt dog, Dance is deaf, Fry has a big pipe, Bates is a drunk, and so on). Like all bad films, it isn't entirely without virtue - it is elegantly shot, and Mirren, MacDonald and Owen all give good performances. Based on an idea by producers Altman and Balaban, with exteriors shot at Syon House in south-west London. Unbelievably, this won an Oscar for Best Screenplay - I've read food packaging labels with more wit and storyline than this script. This movie typifies everything that's wrong with stuffy British colonial costume-dramas about toffs - it's passionless, dull as dishwater, goes on forever and looks exactly the same as every other such movie.

50,vertigo_14,The Usual Altman Experience. (spoilers),5,10 March 2005,"Altman movies must be an acquired taste. I've seen several so far and it's always the same thing. Lured by a huge cast of big names, but bored to the bone that a story that is entirely too long and in dire need of better editing. Godsford Park, at least for me, is just more of the same.Though pieced together by numerous subplots (as is Altman's style), the primary story is that of a murder mystery slowly unraveling at an English manor in the 1930s. Greed and murder, and the social distinctions that perpetrate the mistrust among the guests and the servants are fine ingredients for a 'Whodunnit' in this film, but never create much suspense. Long scenes and mostly improv dialog are more like a recipe for boredom (at least in my case) and the events unfold about as slowly and anti-climatic as they would in real life. Congrats, however, to amazing art direction (both the costume and sets) which painstakingly recreates an eerie 1930s atmosphere which would have provided a tremendous setting for a more entertaining tale of corruption and deceit.Though disappointed with once again being muddled in ambiguity and tirelessly slow moving scenes for me, this may be a good film for you if you like Altman's consistency of style.",Gosford Park

52,triple8,Deserved it's Oscar nominations.,8,25 May 2005,"SPOILERS: I Remember the year Gosford Park came out and was up for all those Oscars. I'd seen many of the year's movies but somehow had never got around to seeing Gosford Park. The snippets and previews made it look so intriguing I decided I would see it quite soon which I then did not do. My loss because I finally saw it recently and have to say this movie is really good.I have read many of the negative comments and actually many people I know have seen it and not enjoyed it. I can actually understand the negatives and will freely admit, that at times, this is a tough movie to just relax and enjoy. You have to constantly be on alert-the amount of main characters in Gosford Park, is so expansive, I can't imagine anyone NOT having a hard time remembering names or even who is who. I struggled with all of that as well as with the incredible talky dialog-something that I usually like but that in this movie, was taken to such extremes it was difficult to make out a lot of what was said. If this review is sounding negative I don't mean it to. But, there's no doubt that it can be understood why somebody would have a hard time with this or even turn it off in midstream.For me, I was having such a hard time following what was going on that I finally gave up and just figured I'd relax and try to enjoy what I could actually understand. And once I did that, I started liking this movie a lot more. Part of the reason is because the movie contains so many interesting things going on, it's inevitable that something will make one take notice. It's really not a movie I could tune out or turn off. And though the confusion is present throughout the film, the story is such an interesting one I'm glad I gave it a chance and saw it through.Many have commented the murder wasn't the focus of the film and that is true. It doesn't even happen to well more then halfway through. But the ""who done it"" aspect is still there to some degree. This movie combines many different things- a scorching, almost satirical and mischievous drama on social class-with a multi character study with an Agatha Christie like mystery. It is throughly confusing, at times very frustrating, amazingly talky, and sometimes a bit muddled. And yet it is also intriguingly beautiful and brilliantly made. It maybe that if one can't like it, they can certainly admire it and though it had many a strange and challenging moment I'm not one who thinks a movie has to be enjoyable all through to still be an excellent movie. This wouldn't, by any means, make it into my top ten, not even my top 100, but I maybe admire it a bit more then many movies that would be on that list.I wont even bother to single out any particular performance as all were great and the photography, direction etc were all great as many have said but there are not a lot of comments on the musical score. Simply fabulous, that's what got me in the first few seconds of the movie. The musical score fits so well-it's got that same almost indescribable element as the movie and that's important because music can be so important to a movie. This is one of the best movie scores I've ever heard.Gosford Park is a movie that almost begs to be seen twice. I plan to, personally I don't think this is a movie that can be full enjoyed the first time around. I freely admit I still can't remember over half the names of the characters. Or who said what. And who they said it to. Maybe I still won't after seeing it again but you never know. An impressive movie and my vote's 8 of 10.",Gosford Park
53,Spleen,"Sorry, Altman, it IS a whodunnit - and a good one",9,10 April 2002,"For once, the small-minded hucksters of the publicity department are right, and the film's director (and some critics) are wrong.  The most misleading thing you can say about this film is that it's ""not really a detective story"".  It IS a detective story, as much as anything is.  It should not be approached any other way.That's why the following spoilers really are spoilers (even though I'm not going to say who did it).The material is EXACTLY the same as Agatha Christie at her most classical. The year is 1932, the setting a large country house.  (Arguably, this is where Christie set every single one of her Poirot novels, and many of the others, besides - even ""Death Comes at the End"", which is set in Ancient Egypt and heavily filled in with local colour, might as well take place in an English country house of 1932.  The year is crucial.  Books set as late as the 1960s take class relations as they existed in 1932 or thereabouts, with the least alteration necessary to keep up with the times.)  There's a party of some sort, and guests are present.  One or two of the guests are ""exotic"" (in this case, from Hollywood ... well, one of them is Ivor Novello, who was in fact Welsh, and counting him there are in a complicated sort of way THREE in the Hollywood party, but the point is that they form a small minority and everyone views them as outsiders).  Servants are everywhere.  Grudges are aired.  At least half of those present are hiding something.  The victim of the murder is a loathsome old patriarch; with one or two exceptions, nobody is particularly sorry to see him go, and at least three people THAT WE KNOW OF have a convincing reason to kill him.The only rule which Christie keeps and Altman breaks is that the servants, from the reader's point of view, be above suspicion.  Here the servants are just as much a part of the story as their masters.  Which, in fact, makes the story no less classical.  Christie was snob enough to make the servants part of the story only on very rare occasions, but when they WERE part of the story, they were suspects - and on at least one occasion (I'm sure I could think of more if I tried) a servant turned out to be the murderer. Interestingly, an even faster rule of Christie's is that the ""exotic"" elements of the party are never serious suspects and certainly never guilty, unless they also turn out to be not really exotic after all - if, say, the ""Austrian writer"" is really the assumed identity of the missing half-brother everyone had been talking about.  It's interesting that Altman has no interest in breaking THIS rule.  The three exotic characters are, beyond doubt, innocent  (So is the central character, Mary; so are a few others whose alibi the camera explicitly establishes.  EVERYONE else is a suspect. This is how Christie would have had it.)Altman takes THE classical Christie story and gives complex realism.  He shows us what the servants were doing.  He shows us more about the psychology of class relations than I would have thought possible in such a short time.  It's just as well that he does this, for he lacks Christie's supreme skill at misdirection, or anything like it: if we find ourselves failing to suspect the right people, it's not because we've been led to devote our energies suspecting the wrong people, but because we were distracted by all the fascinating sociological buttressing.  Fair enough. Altman doesn't use his skill to cheat; we have all the clues we need.Up until the actual murder, all is perfection.  This is the bit that Agatha Christie would have strained to make interesting; Altman succeeds effortlessly and three times as well as he really needs to (which is a GOOD thing).  After the murder, where Christie would start to really get going, Altman seems to lose interest (he's stated in interviews that he really didn't have much interest in this part, but that's no excuse).  The strange position in which the actor-pretending-to-be-a-valet finds himself is interesting, but neglected by the script, as is the unravelling of the crime.  Too much of the second half is devoted to showing us again what we've already seen.Oh, and to the excruciatingly laboured routine in which Detective Melchit - sorry, Stephen Fry - demonstrates how much dumber he is than his constable. Yes, the upper-class detective is a twit and the working-class policeman is capable.  Hooray for the working class.  (It's jarring, as well as being a cheap shot.  None of the other master/servant relationships had been this shallowly defined.)  I like the fact that the guilty parties were uncovered by accident, and that Scotland Yard didn't have a chance because the thick layer of snobbery which covered the south of England would have to be dismantled rather than cut through; but surely this point would have carried more force if the detective had been a competent professional (true professionals being another class altogether), whose inability to solve the crime hadn't been his fault.  ""I see no reason to question the servants,"" says Stephen Fry breezily.  Here Altman fails to understand what he was doing.  He thought he was merely satirising Agatha Christie, but in the GOOD parts of the film, he was in fact doing something far more impressive - he was creating an alternate, richer, more socially aware version of her.",Gosford Park
54,onepotato2,What if someone really thoughtful filmed a murder mystery?,7,7 January 2002,"I always liked the first half of this movie. And I appreciate a few other Altman movies, not all of them. But I've come to respect GP as a very nuanced, layered movie after viewing it again a few times. Here Altman appropriates a set-up familiar to those who've seen The Rules of the Game, and turns it into a whodunit. But terming the film a 'whodunit' will surely cause disappointment, as ""who done it?"" is nowhere near as interesting as the depiction of hordes of servants lingering in the wings to support an enfeebled upper class. And even more intriguing is why an unexpected character can solve the crime, but the police inspector can't.The movie presents a world teetering on the edge of Depression, in which a crime can't be solved because information needs to be exchanged between two strata of a cross-section of English society; but the social order is so codified (the gentry and the service) that they do not meaningfully interact. No one who's ambitious can bear to interact with the servants - And due to a dehumanizing class convention, the gentry doesn't even know their last names. In the end, a fawning, class conscious inspector can't solve the crime, but a lowly maid, who enjoys the most relaxed relationship with her superior seen in the movie - and thus moves easiest between the two worlds - uses information gleaned from both worlds to solve the murder, and the mystery.Just after everyone is let off the hook, the credits roll and a song performed by Jeremy Northam underscores the bifurcation that results in two classes, hitting you with the message: ""Somewhere there's another land different than this world below (get it?), far more mercifully planned than the cruel place we know."" For the previous two and a half hours, social boundaries have for once resulted in mercy for the lower class. The oppressive system has, in an unusual twist, worked in favor of the servants this time.I have small problems with the movie but it IS smart. And 'boring movies, as some have termed this, offer you space to think, instead of just sitting there passively distracted by equally meaningless surface activity. There is much more to say and multiple ways to receive the film, but I've hit on my major points. It works on different levels; other people are free to say other smart things about it. There is some nice chiaroscuro camera-work and at least two excellent performances. The motivations that Maggie Smith can suggest with just a small facial shift are amazing.",Gosford Park

With a great ensemble cast, plenty of overlapping dialogue, and an almost indescribable and documentary like filmmaking style, ""Gosford Park"" is has Altman's signature style written all over it!It's interesting to note that the actual murder mystery plot doesn't began until over halfway into the film.

56,nycritic,We All Have Secrets.,10,15 November 2005,"There are directors who can direct huge, massive Cecil B. deMille epics like Peter Jackson. There are directors who have done nail-biting suspense, usually drenched in subtext, like the Director, Alfred Hitchcock. There are others who can do whatever they want and create beautiful, detached yet powerful films like Stanley Kubrick. Then there are ones who are brilliant with ensembles, telling stories which converge and often overlap within a main plot. One of them is the great Woody Allen. The other one is Robert Altman.GOSFORD PARK is an update of Jean Renoir's 1939 film LE REGLE DU JEU, in which wealthy relatives of an aristocrat come to a shooting party at a country home. Here, because of the obviously strained relationships between the host and his family has been less than amicable, it serves as a springboard where everyone's worst behavior and heretofore concealed feelings towards each other really come forth with an undertone of mean-spirited cruelty just brimming below the surface, while the servants act as non-entities when in their employers' presence but occasionally break into.Boasting one of the best introduction sequences ever, itself lengthy but necessary, GOSFORD PARK is a tour-de-force of narration that recalls Jane Austen's work. We first see Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald, playing innocence that becomes a keen observer), maid to Lady Constance Trentham (Dame Maggie Smith, having a splendid time in her role), and Lady Trentham's flighty demands and annoyed conversation as they make their way to Gosford Park. They cross paths with movie actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), his agent Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), and Weissman's protégé, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), who is the only one who doesn't introduce himself proper for reasons made clear later on, also heading towards the manor. The hellos are strained -- Lady Trentham is clearly not the friendly type --, but Mary is starstruck like the young girl she is. Once they (and the other guests) reach the house, activity is buzzing almost factory-like (factory being an important term here) as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren, taking self-control and omniscient stillness to a whole different level in a performance that has to be analyzed frame by frame), calmly gives out her orders. However, Altman, Fellowes, and Patrick Doyle bring a little extra dose to the scene the moment Robert Parks (Clive Owen) enters the picture and introduces himself to Mrs. Wilson while Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins) passes them by and turns to hear. Not soon after, the camera makes a zoom into a bottle of poison: itself symbolic since immediately after that, the rest of the characters begin to show hints of their own shared ""poison."" Isobel McCordle (Camila Rutherford), William (Michael Gambon) and Sylvia McCordle's (Kristin Scott Thomas) daughter, is carrying on with Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) who is tied to a marriage of convenience to Mabel (Claudie Blakely) whom he feels ashamed of. The Stockbridges are also on the outs, Lord Raymond (Charles Dance) preferring the safety of ""his own kind"" according to Louisa Stockbridge (Geraldine Sommerville) who is one of William McCordle's many women. Mary learns of the McCordle's familial relation to Ivor Novello from fellow maid Elsie (Emily Watson) who, while staunchly expresses her near-hatred for Lady Sylvia, suggests ever-so-slightly she whom she prefers working for. A later scene reveals little love between the McCordles, William McCordle's repudiation of Lady Constance (and his threat of withdrawing her pension) and even less love between the Nesbitts, and even more tension between the Merediths (Tom Hollander and Natasha Wightman) as they try to con McCordle into some odd business. Greed, lust, and secrets, permeating every pore of Gosford Park and its inhabitants.As a script (and a story written by Julian Fellowes), GOSFORD PARK is one of the most tightly and detailed ever committed to film because it forces the viewer to pay close attention to what characters are saying or suggesting to each other through their body language because everything has its own meaning; nothing is said or done to fulfill a plot requirement or for the sake of making conversation and even the most trivial hints are steps leading towards bigger and bigger denouements, primarily because the characters reveal in snippets pieces of information that tell us they know more about themselves than we do -- and this is its greatest asset. It is the equivalent of an abstract painting that upon scrutiny reveals layers and layers of what people dare not express up front and direct. This makes it, in fact, a delicious mystery and an open secret at the same time. Death and its cause-effect, an element ever present in an Altman film, never looked more elegantly funny. In this movie, with death coming as a murder (or double-murder if you will) to a widely disliked character, only Louisa Stockbridge expresses concern and even then it's somewhat insincere. Altman has great fun exposing the crime scene, but even more fun introducing Stephen Fry as the largely inept investigator because while the truth is brandished right in front of his face under the form of the aforementioned ""blink and miss"" pieces of information we've been getting, he doesn't see it before we do.GOSFORD PARK is also a meditation about an era where people who represent the exploited part of British society -- Robert Parks, Mrs. Wilson, Elsie --, and outsiders such as Mabel Nesbitt or Morris Weissman react against this caste system that seemed unmindful of the changes happening in the outside world. This doesn't necessarily solve anything or everything that occurs in GOSFORD PARK -- some plots are hinted at and that is fine -- but it does present an intricate comedy of manners of a time gone by just before WWII when Upstairs people mingled and shared their lives with the Downstairs people.Edited 11.17.2006",Gosford Park
57,philip_vanderveken,A movie that has recreated life in England in the 1930's in a very good way,8,15 March 2005,"I can imagine that this movie isn't exactly to everybody's taste. Especially because it takes some time before it really gets to a decent pace and because it is set in a time period that only few people seem to be interested in. Nevertheless this is still an interesting movie that gives a good insight on how society in the period between the two world wars was organized in the UK (and in other European countries as well).In the beginning of the movie you'll only get to see the differences between the high society and their servants in the 1930's, but as the movie progresses, you'll see that the image of perfection and separation between the two classes wasn't always that clear. Even though Sir William McCordle lives like an aristocrat, with servants, hunting parties, dinner parties,... the man isn't really loved at all. He is in fact a wealthy industrialist who is only accepted by the family, the aristocracy and his 'friends' because of his money. And they are all prepared to go a long way to get it...Gosford Park is a complicated, but very interesting story that has been spiced up with murder, hate, love, deceit, romance, betrayal,... and that has become a very fine movie thanks to the good direction of Robert Altman. Not only has he been able to portray his characters in a very fine way, he has also managed to give the movie a feeling of authenticity. If you are interested in this time period and the people that lived then, than this movie is definitely something for you. If not, than I guess you better leave it alone, because you'll be very bored by it. Personally I liked it and that's why I give it a well deserved 7.5/10.",Gosford Park
58,mike48128,The prequel to Douton Abby from the same writer,10,3 June 2018,"Also based in part on a concept by Robert Altman, also the producer and director. It's a sociable weekend hunting party hosted by the rich industrial patriarch William McCordle and attended by his family and guests. One of the most unusual guests is a Hollywood producer who is making a Charlie Chan murder mystery movie with an English Estate setting (to be filmed in Hollywood). William is murdered near the last hour. Many people are suspect and there are actually two murderers. He is poisoned with whiskey first and then stabbed after he is already dead! The majority of the story relates to the amorous situations between the upstairs guests and the servants. The 2nd ""killer"" is an illegitimate son of ""William"". A marvelous ensemble cast including Maggie Smith (The matriarch) , Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and so many others. The first killer is not really identified but the fatal drink is served by the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren). However, like an Agatha Christie style-story, there are many suspects and we are not certain if it wasn't a conspiracy with a concert of many. ""Inspector Tom"" doesn't take the whole thing too seriously, and surprisingly, everyone is soon free to leave. Acclaimed as Robert Altman's other masterpiece after ""M*A*S*H.

They won't make anyone disappointed.But still, is this a relation drama or detective fiction? Is it a remake of Agatha Christie without her characters but together with the rest of her art? It's difficult to say, but the story can't fill nearly 2,5 hours.

60,valadas,Old fashioned crime story but good movie,7,3 March 2008,"This is a crime story that leads us to the memories of Agatha Christie's books since it creates an atmosphere so similar to that of her novels. We are expecting to see Monsieur Poirot enter anytime during the second half of the movie. But putting this idea aside it's really a good movie with its atmosphere of an old aristocratic British mansion in the thirties of last century with all its lordships and ladyships, guests and their servants above all. The characters are all very interesting and well depicted in images and dialogues by an extremely good cast of actors and actresses. This is really the most important part of the movie and we get the impression that the murder that pops in suddenly in the middle of the movie is a mere pretext to give a plot to its story otherwise we would be left with no more that a lot of sketches and scenes regarding this or that couple of characters often with no relation between them. The murder story is indeed the weakest part of the movie and is not totally explained in clear terms being a bit confusing in terms of who did what, why and how. Nevertheless we feel ourselves compensated by watching this impeccable typically British aristocratic atmosphere of the time, the relations among its members and the servants'lives and their different behaviour in front of their masters and behind their backs including their opinions and comments about those same masters. One last word to the scenery and particularly to the mansion interior which is gorgeous and contributes to its realistic view totally adequate to the general atmosphere of the story.",Gosford Park
61,Howlin Wolf,"Some excellent individual scenes and great performances, but it doesn't add up to much...",5,10 October 2002,"Whether or not you enjoy ""Gosford Park"" will probably depend on what you're watching it for.  It offers an excellent recreation of relationships between the upper-class and their servants and some wonderfully dry and concise dialogue.  This means if a particular scene is executed well then it sticks in your mind.  The problem is, I just didn't feel the film hung together very well as a whole.  There were so many characters that some were reduced to irrelevancies, and the dramatic centre of the movie was disappointingly limp and long in coming.  It's almost as if the murder were an irritating distraction that got in the way of - rather than revealed - the characters' idiosyncrasies.   The character stuff is entertaining, but as I said, there are too many of them, and if a film is intent on capturing my attention for two and a half hours then it must act as if the tension is integral to developments, rather than merely being an insubstantial in-joke for the audience's amusement.If you like character studies then I think you'll find the murder gets in the way, and if you like murder mysteries then much of the interaction only serves to confuse rather than inform.  It's an ambitious undertaking, and by no means a totally worthless experience, but despite the best efforts of the performers involved, there's really not a whole lot here to get worked up about.",Gosford Park
62,punishmentpark,"Good, good fun, so to say.",8,23 March 2016,"The English countryside atmosphere is established straight away, complete with a dreary rain shower in which the guests arrive. It was fun to see so many familiar faces, especially Maggie Smith from 'Downton Abbey' (which was made as sort of a sequel by the producers of this film - as I understand it). Laurence Fox (DC Hathaway in the TV-series 'Lewis') may easily be missed, since his part is very small. For the rest of them, just check the IMDb cast list.'Gosford park' is a somewhat chaotic movie. It's pretty hard to figure out who's who and what is exactly going on in all the nooks and crannies of the big estate, but if you stay focused, a first viewing should offer enough information to get the gist of things. There is of course a murder mystery, but not until late into the film. The most important themes aren't revealed until even later, either, so what remains for the bulk of the time, is the doings and dealings of the upstairs and downstairs population, which I found quite entertaining and intriguing to observe. The addition of an American movie director talking about making a detective film, was rather funny. And there's plenty more parts like that, of which I must mention Stephen Fry's detective character.Maybe the story is quite contrived, but it worked for me and Robert Altman's direction is always a pleasure to witness. There's a lot of fine acting here (of course), but I will probably never become a fan of Clive Owen; something about his presence is just plain dull to me.Good fun was had by all, so to say. 8 out of 10.",Gosford Park
63,Maciste_Brother,Excellent,8,1 January 2003,"I'm not a big Robert Altman fan. I usually steer clear from most of his films, certainly after experiencing Quintet and Popeye years ago. But I have to say that I really loved Gosford Park. Personally, I think the film is TOO simple for its own good. The resolution is too matter of fact, certainly compared to the way the rest of the movie was deliberately filmed in a quasi-spontaneous, free flowing way. I wished the ending would have been less melodramatic. But with that said, I still think this movie is beautiful and brilliant. It's like watching a painting, where the scenery and people move about. I can't wait to buy the DVD.One day, when I'll have a High Definition TV, I'll play GP's DVD and simply watch it like a painting.",Gosford Park
64,bobsgrock,A most subdued Agatha Christie.,8,18 July 2010,"The classic set-up for what many see as a murder mystery is shaken up and given a good thrashing in Robert Altman's Gosford Park, taking the form and context of such an episode and practically paying no attention to the actual murder. Indeed, the murder doesn't even take place until well over an hour into the film and by the end we get somewhat of an explanation as to the who and why, but all that is an aside.Typical of Altman, what he attempts to do, and succeeds brilliantly at, is show all facets of what ordinarily wouldn't be shown in the stories of Christie and other famous British murder-mystery writers. In most cases, the servants are involved one way or another yet are hardly used in the narrative until the climax. Here, Altman uses his gliding camera and overlapping dialogue to explore and find out information about all the characters, be they high-ranking or low. Here, the servants' gossip and information is just as important, if not more so, than that of the people sitting outside in the dining room with nothing to do but immerse themselves in idle chatter and sardonic wit about others less fortunate than themselves.In many ways, Altman observes this dry behavior of the typical stuffy British aristocrats and is somewhat poking fun at them. Yet, he still maintains a veil of sympathy and we still care for many of these characters, particularly the under-appreciated staff. As I said before, the murder is quite unimportant yet still provides some interesting surprises at the end. As a fan of Altman, this doesn't rank with MASH, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville, or 3 Women. But, it is a breath of fresh air in the unbelievably stuffy British murder-mystery genre.",Gosford Park

Not my favourite Robert Altman movie, but very well made.",Gosford Park
66,baumer,Robert Altman's nostrum,5,22 January 2002,"May be some small spoilersI would love to see what would happen if a film like this came out in the summer.  When it is surrounded by big sloppy and grandiose pictures and is given plenty of time to disappear from critics memories and subsequent top ten lists, would it still be remembered come Oscar time or even Golden Globe time?  I ask this because I saw this film last Wednesday, five days before the Golden Globes were awarded and when I walked out I was aghast at how lame of a film this was, how truly boring the film really is.  Then I am watching the G.G's and not only is the film nominated in categories it has no business being nominated in, but Altman wins for best director.  I says pardon?  But to be fair, not that most of the other films that are being heralded this year as Oscar front runners are much better ( with the exception of Lord of the Rings) but to include Gosford Park on a short list of films that are the best the year 2001 has to offer is quite appalling. 
I am not going to bore you with plot devices or names of people in the film or the character's they play because let's face it, you could seriously be here until tomorrow trying to make sense of it all.  If you want a glowing positive review about the film and a review which tries to make sense of it all, go to www.chicagosuntimes.com/Ebert and then type in Gosford Park.  The venerable old film critic loved it and has dissected the film for all of those who may want to know everything there is to know about the characters.Gosford Park takes place in jolly old crusty, parvenu England in the 1930's. Many of England's aristocratic population have been invited to a rich guy's house for a hunting party for the weekend.  Here the guests worry more about who they are sitting beside and what they are going to wear than they do about the well being of one another nor do they really offer any sort of friendly allegiance to any one particular person.  Everyone just seems to go because if they don't then they would be missing the social event of the year.  This is where all of the gossip takes place and perhaps business is talked about in it's infant stages.  Most of the people on the upper level are boring old bats that lead sheltered lives and have no idea how the rest of the world lives.  They may wipe their behinds with gold-laced tissue but they probably couldn't tell you what the capital of Greece is.  Their lives are protected by the bubble of naivete that most of them live in.  The only lives I was somewhat interested in were that of the American movie producer, the movie star and their Scottish valet.  Of course, there is a secret that this vallet has and if you can't figure it out in the first ten minutes of the film then you haven't seen enough movies.  The valet is played by Ryan Phillipe and to me, he has turned into quite an impressive performer.  I enjoy him in almost everything he is in and this is probably his most complete performance since Cruel Intentions.  Downstairs you have the proletariat, the humble servants.  And while their lives seem to be slightly more intriguing than those that they serve, I still wasn't swayed.  Upstairs and downstairs people gab and chatter and talk and converse but more times than not it really amounts to much a do about nothing.  I realize that all of this bantering about is supposed to set up the murder of one of the rich guys.  But with this much going on in the house, both up and down, you tend to lose site of the facts.  Okay, was this maid sleeping with this rich guy or was this butler really that bitter towards that employer and so on.  By the time the murder does take place, I was almost asleep.  And there lies the problem.Boredom.I really was bored with all that was happening.  I didn't really care for the snobbishness of the upper echelon nor was I intrigued with the tenderness and sweetness of the lower class citizens.  And finally when someone gets a knife in the chest about six hours into the film, I was ready to exclaim ""haleluaaaaa!!!"".  Things do get a little interesting when the inspector arrives on the scene.  He seems like Keystone cop, John Cleese like from a Fish Called Wanda.  He is dull, not very careful with what he touches and amusingly overlooks obvious clues.  His deputy seems much more in touch with what is happening than he ever chooses to be and this adds some much needed comic relief.Gosford Park is just another in the long list of over-hyped late season films that are really just disappointments.  The list includes but is does not end with Beautiful Mind, The Majestic, Ali and even The Royal Tenenbaums disappointed me a bit.This has not been a banner year for films and Gosford Park takes it's rightful and deserving place as one of the bigger disappointments and one of the weaker films I have seen thus far this year.5 out of 10- This is only rated this high because I enjoyed Phillipe and I have to give credit to the editor of the film who must have had hours of work ahead of him and did quite an admirable job.  Nice job Mr. Squyres.",Gosford Park

68,mattymatt4ever,A COMPLETE BORE!!!,3,21 February 2002,"No offense to those who found this movie to be brilliant--but I got nothing! I haven't seen any of Altman's past work.  I only know him by reputation. He is known to be a very talented filmmaker--at least that's what most people believe--who specializes in films that contain an ensemble of characters.  Well, if I gave a damn about any of these characters, I wouldn't hold anything against Altman.  But none of these characters--except for Maggie Smith's, slightly--engaged me.  The movie is about two hours and fifteen minutes and feels like an eternity. It's like watching a stage play--a very boring one.  The characters talk and talk and talk and talk some more.  So it is a dialogue-driven piece. Even dialogue-driven pieces often have some visual eye candy, though not in abundance.  Anybody who has read a book on Screenwriting knows that audiences do not want to see talking heads!  OK, there are movies like ""American Buffalo"" and ""The Big Kahuna"" which are both based on plays and contain lots of talking heads, but the acting is so powerful in those movies that I didn't feel nearly as claustrophobic as I did when watching ""Gosford Park.""  Now, the cast is definitely full of talent.  As my Dad said--and he's pretty much right--most of our greatest actors come from England.  And many of those great English actors are in this movie:  Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, Kristen Scott Thomas, etc.  But their characters are so dull that they really didn't have much to work with.  But I do have to say--and this is just me--that the English accents are thick and sometimes quite hard to understand.  Of course, if this movie didn't depend too much on dialogue, I could still catch on to the story.  But since it does, I had a hard time keeping track of the story.  I was at the point where I was struggling to stay awake and about halfway through I didn't even bother trying to figure it out.  The humor is quite bland.  Once again, maybe it's just because I'm American and I don't share the English mentality.  Though I've seen a fair deal of funny English comedies, let's face it--there are always certain things that are funny to one ethnic group, and not funny to others.  So I'll give the comedy element the benefit of the doubt.  If this were an American movie and it wasn't funny--I have the right to say it's not funny.  I'd rather keep an open mind.  However, Maggie Smith has a few funny lines.  I like the scene in which Bob Balaban, who plays a hotshot Hollywood director, is about to pitch the story for his new movie, but he doesn't want to give anything away.  Smith comments, ""It's OK.  We're not gonna see it anyway.""  I wouldn't exactly say that she deserves an Oscar for her role, but she is the one person who actually breathed some life into this film and I commend her. This is basically supposed to be a mystery/thriller, and it could've been much more intriguing.  That's why I compare this movie to a boring, monotonous college professor giving a lecture:  You know that whatever he's teaching can be fun and exciting, but it's delivered in such a deadpan fashion that no one cares to listen--or in this case, watch. 
Maybe the artistic quality of this film completely flew over my head; maybe not.  You be the judge.  I'm just giving my honest, unpretentious opinion. If you want to see something deep and compelling, and keeps you interested, I suggest you buy a ticket for ""In the Bedroom.""  But if you find ""Masterpiece Theater"" moving and thought-provoking, you'll probably have a ball with ""Gosford Park.""My score:  3 (out of 10)",Gosford Park
69,classicalsteve,"Brilliant Non-Linear WhoDunIt Altman Style -- Sort of MASH meets Agatha Christie, but may not be for typical mystery buffs",10,24 December 2008,"If you're appetite is for a typical Agatha Christie murder mystery, it may be best to look elsewhere. As another reviewer pointed out, the whodunit aspect takes a back seat to the spontaneous interactions of the characters, which are split between the filthy rich and the hired help. The story is completely non-linear. The script is literally wall-to-wall character studies, with the players moving from scene-to-scene like real people moving from room-to-room. What they do and how they got to this place is revealed only incidentally, leaving the audience to speculate as to the characters' back stories. And there is plenty of overlapping dialog to add to the ambiguity. It feels more like the viewer is spying on these people rather than watching a typical movie presentation.In true Altman style, two dozen characters are thrust together by way of a holiday weekend at a large English manor. The aristocrats are very busy, dressing, gossiping and shooting harmless birds by day, eating luxurious meals, playing games, and enjoying entertainment from a Hollywood movie star by night. They probably need some relaxation from all that work. All the while the servants are preparing food, washing clothes needlessly at night, and polishing their employers' watches with barely a moment to enjoy a meal or other extra-curricular activity themselves. But the servants and aristocracy share something in common: they all have their own little stories which are revealed in bits and pieces through unselfconscious dialog.Both sides enjoy equal screen time. However, as the events progress, the viewer realizes that the hired help is not viewed in quite the same way as their aristocratic counterparts. Even from the beginning, when two of the upper-class characters are squabbling about their ""problems"", one of the servants overhears their discourse. When one of the aristocrats realizes that eavesdropping is occurring, the reaction is rather unexpected, ""Don't worry, it's nobody."" The servants don't really count as people, probably the prevailing view in 1930's England which had much of the same view of commoners as it had in the 16th and 17th centuries. And yet this attitude toward servants as ""lesser"" people has a profound impact on the quite unexpected ending of the film. One of the worst of the snobbish aristocrats is Countess Constance, played with perfect over-bearing stiltedness by the incomparable Maggie Smith. And of course she has one of the best lines: ""I haven't a snobbish bone in my body."" But of course she has her employee on bended knee throughout the film. You wonder if she may be a just target of the murderer's weapon! Later in the film, one of the servant characters moves up a few rungs on the hierarchical ladder literally overnight, much to the jealousy of the rest of the hired help.Part of what transpires seems very unscripted. Even by half-way through the film, the viewer only has a vague sense of who these people are. It is akin to certain science fiction films where aspects of futuristic life are presented without explanation. In Gosford Park, the stories of the characters are never announced but only hinted. Even by the moment of the murder, which occurs about 2/3rds through the story, the viewer is only beginning to understand some things about the characters, but much is left unsaid and unrevealed. One of the interesting features of the film is that the story is entirely cast-driven. The ensemble is made up of name talent, but no ""big"" Hollywood stars, which is quite a breath of fresh air from the typical star-driven offerings that Hollywood is constantly cranking out. Instead, the cast is comprised of recognizable character actors who are often in supporting roles in the larger-budgeted Hollywood films. These people are some of the best actors in the business. It's somehow fitting that they would come together for this project.One other notable aspect is that some of the best actors play the servant parts, such as Helen Mirren (academy award-winner) who plays Mrs Wilson, the head woman servant, the late Alan Bates (renowned British actor) as Mr Jennings, the head of all servants, and Derek Jacobi of Caedfel fame as Mr Probert, another butler/servant of the Lord's manor.An outstanding film, with an unexpected and sobering ending that forces you to think rather than feel fully satisfied in an escapist sort of way, like an Agatha Christie presentation might. This is a major achievement and a fitting swan song to one of the most innovative directors who worked in Hollywood, the late Robert Altman. Although this was not technically his last film, this was probably his last best achievement. Not to be missed if you're into cutting edge film-making particularly of the overlapping dialog variety. Altman wrote the textbooks on it, called MASH, The Player, and Gosford Park.",Gosford Park
70,gftbiloxi,"Complex, Witty, and Extremely Entertaining",9,18 May 2005,"Murder mysteries are a very rigid genre, for they carry very strong audience expectations: it will include at least one murder, there will be clues indicating the identity of the killer if one is sharp enough to see them, and the story will conclude with the revelation of the killer. Given its strictness, it is not a genre that one would normally associate with director Robert Altman, who has built a career on a style that gives equal weight to myriads of detail both important and inconsequential and then draws all into a multi-layered thematic whole. And yet in GOSFORD PARK Altman's peculiar style serves not only his broader intent, it serves the genre as well--and it does so to great effect.Like most Altman films, GOSFORD PARK presents us with a wide array of personalities, in this case shown against the backdrop of a 1930s English countryside shooting party where a number of unsavory story lines unfold before us in the form of remarks overheard in passing and details caught out of the corner of the eye. And in this respect, Altman becomes almost as Agatha Christie as Christie herself, distracting us with certain relationships and events even while he clearly specifies the drift toward murder--and the motive behind it--in clear view at one side.But like most Altman films, GOSFORD PARK is about a great deal more than any simple plot summary can indicate. Even while presenting us with a classic murder mystery it is as much about the cruelty of a rigid class system and the manner in which it distorts the personalities of both master and servant, even at a point in time when the control of the ruling class has begun to slip. Surprisingly, however, even these themes play into both the crime and its solution, and the result is a much neater package than generally found in an Altman film.Altman, who works in a mosaic-like style, is an extremely problematic director in the sense that you either like his work a great deal or you dislike it with considerable intensity. GOSFORD PARK, which features a particularly fine ensemble cast even for an Altman film, will not change the opinion of either group, and for all its success the film does not attain the same shocking sharpness and breadth of his penultimate statement, NASHVILLE. But even so, it is Altman at his best and in an somewhat more accessible form than usual, and I recommend it very strongly.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Gosford Park
71,jhclues,Altman's Best Film,10,12 February 2002,"Director Robert Altman assembled an all-star ensemble cast for this story of mores and morals, relationships and class distinction.  It's an insightful foray into the human condition, filled with pettiness, indiscretion, passion and lust, dignity (as well as lack thereof), an aloof disregard for our fellow man, and finally, even love; all of the things that make life-- well, if not worth living-- just `life,' by definition.  It's all found in `Gosford Park,' during one particularly eventful weekend, from which Altman manages to paint a vivid and realistic portrait that is a telling study of what it is that makes the world go round. 
	It's 1932 England, and a select group of those from the upper crust of society have gathered at the country estate of Sir William and Lady Sylvia McCordle (Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas) for a weekend shooting party.  But it's a weekend that will find the guests engaging in a variety of `sports,' the least of which has to do with the shooting of birds, and will ultimately involve the untimely demise of one of those present.  Yes, murder is afoot among the privileged and those who serve them, and there are suspects and motives aplenty.  And though it's a dreadful affair, it causes seemingly little consternation among the friends and family of the deceased, and at the same time affords at least one guest, Mr. Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), with a unique opportunity.  Weissman is a Hollywood movie producer, in attendance at this extended soiree for the purpose of researching his next project, `Charlie Chan in London,' a murder mystery that takes place at a country estate.  So it appears that this may become a case of art imitating life.  First, however, the dust will have to settle and it will all have to be sorted out; and we find that before it's over, that can be a murky business, indeed.  But such is life among the aristocracy, among whom even murder can be taken in stride-- and life goes on.  	Altman's film makes a subtle, yet powerful statement about what compels the human animal and serves as the impetus of his actions.  Written by Julian Fellowes (from an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban), the film sagely explores the cross purposes inherent in the convergence of individual agendas and needs, and the conflicts they must, therefore, naturally inspire.  Altman's characters are extremely well developed, and presented in such a way that the audience is able to keep track of who is who and where the many and myriad pieces of the puzzle fit together, though they are numerous and involve a number of storylines and subplots.  As he is wont to do, Altman keeps you emotionally somewhat at arm's length, yet still involved, setting a deliberate pace that will make you oblivious of the time it takes him to tell his story (137 minutes).  The contrasts he draws between the classes, and even the diverse personalities of those within them, are incisive; and in that distinction we learn so very much about who we really are and what makes us tick.  The oppressively dry and reserved British bearing and atmosphere that permeates every frame of the film suits Altman's stoic style exceptionally well, and he displays such an eye for detail, from everything that happens visually, to the little snippets of peripheral dialogue and the rendering of all the human flaws and imperfections that make it so real, that this just may be his most perfect film yet.	As can be expected from such an inspired cast, the performances that drive this film are second to none; but the fact that he was able to sustain such consistent quality and excellence from his actors-- considering the size of his cast alone-- is quite a feat, for which Altman deserves another nod of acknowledgement.  There are a number of outstanding performances here that deserve to be singled out, but the most memorable are turned in by Helen Mirren, who is extremely affecting as Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper with a dark secret; Kelly Macdonald, as Mary, the new maid struggling to learn the ropes of service and the ways of the very rich; Emily Watson, as Elsie, the Head Housemaid whose entanglements lead her into murky waters; Sophie Thompson, as Dorothy, the Still Room Maid (Thompson is arguably one of the best character actors around, as she demonstrates here); and Maggie Smith, as Constance, the Countess of Trentham, turning in a performance that is the definitive portrayal of privilege.  Also noteworthy are Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas (who is absolutely elegant) and Ryan Phillippe, as Mr. Weissman's man, Henry Denton.	Rounding out this superb cast are Alan Bates (Jennings), Jeremy Northam (Novello), Camilla Rutherford (Isobel), Charles Dance (Lord Stockbridge), Geraldine Somerville (Lady Stockbridge), Eileen Atkins (Mrs. Croft), Derek Jacobi (Probert), Richard E. Grant (George), Clive Owen (Robert Parks) and Stephen Fry (Inspector Thompson).  A transporting film that captures a time and place that now belongs to the ages, `Gosford Park' establishes the realization that environments and those who populate them are ever changing-- and yet they stay inexplicably the same; it's the nature of who we are and how we thrive, for better or worse.  And it's that essence that Robert Altman captures so succinctly here.  This is riveting, entertaining drama that teaches us something, if only we are willing to listen; and even the best of us would be well served to do just that.  By seeing the way things are, perhaps it will give us pause to reflect upon the way things `should' be.  Perhaps it is possible to create a world in which the `Upstairs, Downstairs' mentality is no longer viable; a world in which all men are viewed as equal.  It may be concealed within the context, but it's a question Altman nevertheless effectively asks with this film.  That's the power of the cinema-- and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Gosford Park

73,gbheron,Another Altman Gem,10,3 September 2002,"I've been a long-time Robert Altman fan, and am very partial to his cinematic story-telling style. Even his less well-received efforts are usually personal favorites. But there are no disagreements between the movie critics, paying public, and me with ""Gosford Park"". It's almost unanimously considered one of 2001's best movies. (I've read that if Altman kept his mouth shut during Oscar-voting season, he'd own one now). 
Set in 1930s England, it transpires over a weekend-long hunting party at a baronial country estate. The action is split between the high-society guests, and their servants. In true Agatha Christie fashion, someone is murdered, but the murder is not the heart of the movie. It's the characters themselves, and how they interact and relate with one another, formally and informally, servant and master. This movie is Grade A in every respect. It's an especially good choice for a rental on a 'family night' and everyone's sick to death of romantic comedies and cheap actioners.",Gosford Park

Do you like the 1970's British television series UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS? If your answer to any of these questions is yes, then do I have a film for you.GOSFORD PARK is an English Murder Mystery, set in the 1920's, featuring an All Star Cast, Directed by a 7 time Oscar nominee. It received critical acclaim in the year it was released (2001), earned 7 Oscar nominations (including Best Picture) and won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay (Julian Fellowes...who would go on to create/write DOWNTON ABBEY).Set in an English Country Manor, overseen by overbearing Lord William McCordle (Michael Gambon, the 2nd Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter films), GOSFORD PARK tells of the trials, tribulations, loves and death (yes, there's a murder) of a host of characters both Upstairs (the wealthy) and Downstairs (the servants).And what a cast it is! Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith, Charles Dance, Jeremy Northam, Tom Hollander and Bob Balaban lead the group of the wealthy, while Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Clive Owen, Kelly MacDonald, Eileen Atkins and Emily Watson head up the cast of servants below the stairs.Both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for their work in this film (both losing to Jennifer Connelly for A BEAUTIFUL MIND).Directed by Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, NASHVILLE), GOSFORD PARK is much of what you would expect from an Altman film...many, many people living their lives, sometimes intersecting with others, often times just going off on their own, tied together by the circumstances of being in this giant manor house on a weekend of a murder.It is an ambitious, ""Oscar bait"" film that succeeds for the most part. And, if you are into the costumes, sets, Interior Design and intimate scenes of people talking, then you will be richly rewarded by this film.I loved this film when it first came out and was anxiously looking forward to re-visiting it.While I still liked it during this viewing, I did find the pacing to be languid and I started finding myself being frustrated by threads and character direction that just sort of petered out or ended all together with no real resolution. I know this was on purpose, for Altman would argue that this is what happens in real life, but I found this frustrating.But this film has much, much going for it and if you haven't seen this - or haven't seen this in awhile - and are a fan of these types of films, then GOSFORD PARK will be a very rewarding 2 hours and 11 minutes of a movie going experience.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Gosford Park
76,FilmOtaku,A drama whose subtle nuances speak volumes,8,14 July 2003,"Most of the people I know who have seen this film tell me they were bored by it because `nothing happened'.  This never fails to amaze me because the film spoke volumes to me about class distinction and morality, while showcasing some of the most beautiful cinematography and set design I have seen in years. Scenes are shot as if the subject matter was framed within a painting, and something as simple as a dining room table was made breathtaking by Robert Altman's expert direction.**Possible Spoiler** 	 Gosford Park follows along the footsteps of `Upstairs/Downstairs' by simultaneously featuring the trials and tribulations of the wealthy and the servants who have to tend to the every need of the society upstairs. It quickly becomes very clear that there isn't a lot of distinction between the two classes other than their money and social standing  even their servants are called by their `masters' names.  Taking place on a weekend in an English home in the countryside in 1932, an almost secondary plot point is the murder of the not-so-genial lord of the manor.  Among the many guests he is entertaining that weekend, there are several suspects.  I say this is all secondary because the main focus is the relationship between the upper and lower class.  While there are class distinctions even among the upper class, there are the same disparities among the servants as well, depending on their job and whom they serve.  While there are some stellar performances in the cast, which is basically a Who's Who of British actors, Maggie Smith is the definite standout.  While she quite obviously revels in her upper class status and is oblivious to the plight of those who serve her, she adds a hint of humanity to her character. Additionally, she says so much with a simple eye roll that I found myself laughing several times due to her dry humor.  The real star of the film however, is the script.  In a film that sees virtually no action, I was kept interested by the amazing dialogue that was clever, profound and disturbing in its frankness.This film received many accolades for good reason.  It is not recommended for those who are looking for something with pizzazz, but rather for those who are looking for intriguing social commentary wrapped up in a beautiful package.",Gosford Park

For a start, this is just so s----l---o---w.While its recreation of country house life is believable and an assemble cast give it their all, there are far better films about such subjects and I am not even sure what this is supposed to be. A snail's version of a  whodunit maybe?People that want to see a great film around this kind of subject should see The Remains of the Day (two leagues above this) or the TV series Brideshead Revisted. I'm all for serious cinema, and can  live with a change of pace, but this didn't engage me at all, in fact it bored the living pants off me.

78,rebeljenn,Loss of direction,5,1 December 2005,"'Gosford Park' takes place in an English country estate, and it is a very social film relating to the different classes and the characters of each class. The film seems to follow more on the servants and pokes a little more fun at the upper classes. The film is really like a 'murder mystery night' and the mystery is discussed through the different characters.Although there was a good original idea behind the film and there were some talented actors and actresses, the film suffered from too many characters and events that really had little or nothing to do with the plot. The film just seemed to be a portal into the social behaviours of the different classes at the country estate. There did not seem to be a clear 'reason' for anything happening on screen. It had some good things going for it, but I think direction was lost.",Gosford Park
79,barryrd,Brilliant cast of characters...inspiration for Downton Abbey,9,29 December 2011,"I was initially drawn to this movie by the excellent cast, mainly British, and period setting, 1930's English country estate, of this powerful film. But the movie turned out to be much more...excellent character studies, dialogue, shrewd observations of the class system and a plot that exposes the linkages between the disparate group that comes together on one weekend in November 1932. The guests and their entourage of servants give a masterly demonstration of the English class system at work with its many protocols and unwritten rules. One can see how it was the inspiration for the television series Downton Abbey with relationships and codes of conduct parallel to what turns up in the current TV saga. In their gossip and the petty details that dominate their lives, we find that underneath their respective roles, these individuals, both the servants or aristocrats, are not really very different form one another. Ironically, the servants are as much the creatures of habit upholding the system, as are the rich and titled who are often not very rich and struggling to hold on to their status. There were enough tongue-in-cheek lines to keep me entertained from start to finish.The movie also shows the world and attitudes of the old order British aristocracy clashing with the new money class from the American film world. There are few references to the world outside that was being torn asunder in the 1930's by depression and impending war. This is the one flaw I found in an otherwise splendid production. The story hinges on the working class victims of the master of the estate, who systematically covered his misdeeds at their expense. There is a murder mystery but it occurs well into the movie. It further highlights the insecurities and vanities of almost everyone in the household.Maggie Smith was brilliant in her role, delivering her lines in a way that mocked the very character she played. The acting of Kelly MacDonald (Boardwalk Empire/HBO), as the personal assistant to Maggie Smith's Lady Trentham, was impressive. We are also treated to the acting of Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Eileen Atkins, Allan Bates, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Charles Dance, Jeremy Northam, Derek Jacobi, and others. All in all, a great movie but with the emphasis on dialogue and acting, it may not be to the liking of all movie-goers. I have seen it on three occasions and would happily watch it again. But I have to confess that I like historical fiction with a large dose of soap opera.",Gosford Park
80,esteban1747,Some features of the aristocracy,7,3 March 2003,"Looking at the film, one sees the scenes scattered without any defined line to follow, it is necessary to go through to avoid missing any scenes otherwise one would not be able to understand the plot. It is certainly an original work of the director Robert Altman. Each person in the film has a determined character, but in general one can conclude that the life of aristocracy is empty in its content, it is also unproductive. The high Lord behaved as former Spanish colonizers, i.e. showing one face, very moral one in front of his relatives, but having sex with all his maidservants and these when pregnant had no other choice than to put their children in a beneficence house..",Gosford Park

People go to the movies to be exhilarated. I came away with very little.  To be sure there were some magnificent performances by Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren.  Indeed the acting throughout was superb, but after 20 minutes I was thoroughly dazed sorting out the characters, and asking myself: ""When are they going to get on with the story?"" Well, the simple answer is...there isn't much of a story.  Anyone believing it is going to be a murder thriller will be sadly disappointed.  With an extremely large cast the film becomes confusing with so many fleeting glances of characters popping in and out of rooms, peering around endless corridors and doorways, snippets of conversational gossip....it feels very much as if you were there with all the noisy background of chatter emanating from people who are living very empty lives.  Slowly you begin to put the pieces together and you comprehend what is going on.  Despite a murder near midnight, nobody seems terribly upset as they adjust to a police investigation which in itself seems very casual.  You get the feeling in the end that it won't be long before another outdoor shooting party will be arranged when the company can get together again and have a nice gossip and the servants below can spy on the goings-on upstairs.",Gosford Park
83,Christian_Dimartino,A classic whodunit.,10,30 May 2010,"We have seen many murder mysteries. But it's rare when one is nominated for an Oscar. That's why Robert Altman's Gosford Park is a rare film to find. Not only is Robert Altman's film a murder/mystery, it's a drama. Gosford Park is a very entertaining film. Clocking in at over two hours, it's a good time waster. But really I don't mean that in a bad way. I mean it's two and a half hours definitely well spent.Gosford park is about a group of celebrities, a bunch of maids, valets, and other people who are staying at a mansion for a dinner party. All goes kind of well until Michael Gambon's character is murdered.One of the main things that makes Gosford Park so good is the cast. Every single actor in this film is terrific. All of the characters, if not lovable, are likable. Bob Balaban, who came up with the idea, is funny, Maggie Smith does a wonderful job at playing a bitch, Kelly McDonald is sweet as she always is, Clive Owen is terrific, so is Hellen Mirren and Kirsten Scott Thomas, and everyone else. Everyone is so good in it, and the film is incredibly entertaining and powerful. This is my favorite of Robert Altman's films. Gosford Park: A+",Gosford Park
84,FlickJunkie-2,A winner for Robert Altman,9,25 July 2002,"Depending on whom you ask, legendary director Robert Altman is either a fool or a genius.  His fifty year career includes prominence in the early days of TV with his direction of dozens of hit series such as `Alfred Hitchcock Presents', `Maverick', and `Bonanza'.   His filmmaking credits include `M.A.S.H.' and `The Player', both critically acclaimed.  His mercurial style of filmmaking is probably a rebellion from the highly structured approach imposed upon him by early TV.  The direction of his recent films can only be described as chaotic, with a cacophony of actors speaking over one another, and moving hither and yon as the camera sweeps from one side of the room to the other attempting to home in on the dialogue of particular characters.  Altman himself admits that he doesn't even read the script and really isn't concerned with what the actors say, as long as things sound right to him when they come out of their mouths.  He encourages ad-libbing and the more disordered the scene, the better he generally likes it.  Often, this produces utter disasters, like `Dr. T and the Women' and `Gun'.  Sometimes it produces a gem like `Gosford Park'.As a murder mystery, Gosford Park is not all that special.  It is fairly predictable with obvious hints dropped at every turn as to who did it and why.  As is the case in most of Altman's recent films, it is difficult to make out a lot of the dialogue with the din on the soundstage of everyone talking at once.  However, what makes this film unique is the treatment of the human dynamic between the aristocracy and the servants.  While lampooning the wealthy by contrasting their behavior with the simple wisdom of commoners is nothing new, never has it been done with such depth and nuance.  Altman's flowing direction of simultaneous events is probably the only way this could have been accomplished so effectively.
The all-star ensemble cast is superlative.  Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam all give fabulous performances upstairs, and Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson and Alan Bates are marvelous downstairs.  For film lovers who enjoy good acting, this film is paradise.Genius or fool?  Who knows, maybe both.  However for Robert Altman, this film is clearly a winner.  I rated it 9/10.",Gosford Park
85,khatcher-2,Upstairs and Downstairs,8,2 October 2003,"Sometimes the exchange of English-language culture across the big pond has been very beneficial to both sides of the Atlantic. Henry James, American, lived and worked most of his life in England, as did T.S. Eliot. Many British-born actors and actresses have become `great stars' on the other side of the Atlantic.More recently we have seen how the Dorset man, Stephen Daldry, crossed the Atlantic and put together `The Hours' (qv), most definitely a great film. In the case of `Gosford Park', Robert Altman came across to Britain and put together an incredible cast to make an enthralling film. Cultural exchanges, are of course, always beneficial in all senses.So with `Gosford Park', a well-written, well-directed and well-acted film which affords delightful viewing. In the style of a stage play, the action takes place in the upstairs lounge of the wealthy ladies and gents, and in the downstairs kitchens of the staff, servants, butlers, cooks and so on. Whether there is any real story to the film is of very secondary importance: one of the invited gentry dies. Who killed him? It does not really matter, and anyway the film leaves us with this ambiguous doubt in the air.What does matter is the personal clashes, whether upstairs or downstairs or in my lady's chamber, or simply in the never-ending passages of the great mansion, to the west of London. The omnipresent tendency to snobbishness, by both the upper and lower classes is manifest in scintillating dialogues, often witty, and so wonderfully carried out in the best British tradition of characteriological theatre pieces. Everyone from Henry Fielding to Tom Stoppard could not be but well pleased with this really delicious offering.
The cast is magnificent; from the affected accent of the upper classes to the `inferior' versions of the English from Leicester or Scotland, one immediately senses part of the essence of this film. The heavily-ladelled hypocracy of the post-Victorian landed-gentry in the 1930's take care of what remains of the vestiges of their supposed dignity. This film runs fairly close to and should be compared with Jane Campion's `The Portrait of a Lady' (1996) (qv) and of course the above-mentioned Stephen Daldry film, as all three capture so splendidly the sociological concepts of the times in superb character interpretations, something which failed miserably in Martin Scorsese's `The Age of Innocence' (1993) (qv). Fortunately, I have the film on VHS and plan to see it again a couple of times before Christmas, so engrossing it is.

It was not great, nor was it bad. And soon, within fifteen minutes of my departure from my seat, do i begin having trouble retelling the story of the movie or even saying what it was about. Gosford Park is one of those movies.Robert Altman certainly shows that he is a very competent film-maker here. Both technically complete as well as narratively interesting this movie is filled with directorial skills. It certainly doesn't lack the actors either, this film is very well acted throughout. Which is not really surprising considering the credits, a long line of fine actors. The story is nothing revolutionary, but quite interestingly told. It's given from two perspectives, first the noble people and then their servants. A relationship that is also causing quite a lot of comedy.So with all that i have recounted above this should be a great movie. Well, i would have to say both yes and no. While i found it to have many qualities there is just something about the whole thing that failed to excite me. Sometimes when i watch a movie i get the feeling that the director has almost worked too hard trying to perfect his style. I get that feeling here. The movie is almost too much, like someone somewhere is trying too hard. Or maybe it's just me.

For one thing, the whole story is told from the point of view of the servants.  For another, the murder isn't so interesting as the stories and scandals between the upper-crust residents and guests and their servants.  Much attention is given to the rigid rules of old English servitude.  There are standout performances by Kelly Macdonald as Mary Maceachran, a young Scottish maidservant, Ryan Philippe as Harry Denton, a Magritte-like character with a strange secret, and Stephen Fry as Inspector Thompson, the incompetent detective.

And nothing blows up in Gosford Park.In fact, the movie doesn't really have a protagonist, and as such the plot sort of meanders. To boot, it's a little arty, which would normally cause me to stop watching mid-way. Don't expect half-action, half-comedy, half-romance -- this is a straight drama.However! It is so fascinating anyway that I must recommend it and you should go see it. The movie is really about two classes of Britains: the servants and the nobles. It has a lot to say and the interactions are interesting and meaningful. Importantly (to an action flick guy like me), the film doesn't try to be overly artistically subtle or coy -- it has something to say and just says it without a lot of fluff or melodrama. And it doesn't just shine in one aspect and drop all the rest (a trick that arty people have the training and refinement to appreciate and I don't).The one critique I would make is that the movie contains a crime and it is, frankly, a detour from the main topic. A few mental leaps about who's behind the crime seemed unsupported to me.Who should see this film:-- Everyone (although kids might not ""get it"" enough to enjoy)-- Action guys like me who are normally bored to tears by dramas (unless you're at the extreme end). When your SO wants to rent this, say yes.-- Anyone who's watched PBS or the BBC way too much and wants to see the servant / master relationship be the subject of the film, not a side issue relegated to stereotypes.I rate Gosford Park a 7 out of 10.",Gosford Park
90,ruby_fff,"Sheer entertainment from Altman and company, nothing less, nothing more.",7,10 February 2002,"If you're a fan of PBS Masterpiece Theatre, Gosford Park is another delightful gâteau to consume and enjoy. English upstairs and downstairs storyline with reasonable murder and intrigue. It's rather a fun romp, murder or no murder, under Robert Altman's direction. Reminds me how Woody Allen has been optimizing ensemble casts in his annual outings. Hannah and her sisters 1986 was superb; Manhattan Murder Mystery 1993 could be a good parallel here. Just watching the ensemble cast enjoying themselves in an Altman or Allen film is sporting enough. With Altman films, mischief and misbehaving are regular ingredients. While Allen has his New Yorker condiments sprinkled throughout matching his Woody sensibilities.Gosford Park has practically an all British cast other than young Ryan Phillippe, and Bob Balaban (whose shared idea with Altman became the literal script) as the Americans in the midst. It's stylistic in set and costume, language and manners. A full 137 mins. of watching the interactions between the stellar cast:  upstairs with Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Camilla Rutherford (the McCordle), Maggie Smith (the Countess), Charles Dance and Geraldine Somerville (the Stockbridge), James Wilby and Claudie Blakly (the Nesbitt), Jeremy Northam, Bob Balaban and others, including inspector Stephen Fry. The downstairs, more colorful in tone, is led by Alan Bates and Helen Mirren, with Eileen Atkins, Derek Jacobi, Richard E. Grant, Emily Watson, Sophie Thompson, guest attendants Clive Owen, Kelly MacDonald, and the 'out of place' Phillippe. Call it a farce, mockery, or mere play (in every sense of the word) - if you dislike not the English ways, you'd enjoy this fine. If you're looking for deep meaning, exciting drama, a tear-jerker (and don't care for spending time with Altman), there are other choices plentiful: Monster's Ball (d: Marc Foster); In the Bedroom (d: Todd Field); Lantana (d: Ray Lawrence); A Beautiful Mind (d: Ron Howard); I Am Sam (d: Jessie Nelson); or a swash-buckling revival of Alexandre Dumas adventure: Count of Monte Cristo, The (d: Kevin Reynolds).",Gosford Park

93,jhaggardjr,All-star astonishment,9,13 January 2002,"""Gosford Park"" is an all-star mystery-comedy directed by veteran filmmaker Robert Altman. One of Altman's specialties is having ensemble casts for his movies (""Nashville"", ""The Player"", ""Short Cuts"", ""Ready to Wear"", ""Cookie's Fortune"", and ""Dr. T and the Women"" are other Altman movies that feature big name casts), and he does the same thing here with ""Gosford Park"". The movie takes place in 1932 when a rich couple invite family and friends for a hunting party weekend. We get to meet these people as well as the servants who work for the couple. Then a murder occurs, and it kind of turns into a tribute to the great mystery novelist Agatha Christie (who's stories usually took place at this time of the century). I really liked the way Altman gets you to know all the characters. There are at least 30 speaking parts in this film and everybody's given a chance to make an impression. ""Gosford Park"" is surronded by an all British cast, with the exception of Americans Ryan Phillippe and Bob Balaban. Of this big cast, Dame Maggie Smith gives the best performance in the film as an acid-tongued dowager who's the aunt of the female host (Kristin Scott Thomas). The moment when a piano playing actor (Jeremy Northam) is playing the piano, finishes up the third piece of music that he's playing and everyone applauds, Smith steps in by saying ""Oh no! Don't applaud and encourage him anymore! He'll just keep playing!"" That is a classic moment thanks to some classic bit of acting by Smith who I've always admired for a long time (she also starred in my all-time favorite mystery movie ""Death on the Nile"" from 1978), and she's really good here. I'm glad she's still around acting (she can also be seen in the recent blockbuster ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""). She's a treat to watch. Other actors who are good here besides Smith, Thomas, Northam, Phillippe, and Balaban, there's Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, Richard E. Grant, Kelly MacDonald, and Eileen Atkins. Everybody's good here. Altman is now 77 years old and has never won an Oscar (he's been nominated for Best Director four times). His first Best Director nomination came over 30 years ago for his classic war comedy ""M.A.S.H."". ""Gosford Park"" could very well win him the Best Director Oscar come this March. If this happens, I think it would be well-deserved. Not only for this film, but for his whole career. But I'd give it to him just for his work on ""Gosford Park"" alone. It's that good of a job. He's long overdue.***1/2 (out of four)",Gosford Park
94,diane-34,A master's touch!,10,3 May 2002,"A wonderfully non-Hollywood movie which concentrates on characters and plot and the subtle interaction of those people rather than the usual tired buildup to a smorgasbord of violence.Altman's plot and direction were a contemporary look back at the way films were assembled during the actual time of the setting of Gosford Park.  In my opinion he was making a film about the early Thirties at the same time that he was making a movie that harkened back to that period: the product was delightfully refreshing in every way!The actors in the film relished the lines and the plot subtlies that  Altman presented to them: because of their consummate acting abilities they were able to add substance to a large assortment of characters which meant that the viewer was able to, in effect, watch many little films rather than simply watching one or two principle actors rolling over many smaller roles-as happens all too often.  The result is a rich pastiche of many characters none of which over-take the entire film.Watch Gosford Park to see, expertly completed, a film of unusual texture and density.",Gosford Park
95,Flagrant-Baronessa,Absorbing & Authentic,8,11 October 2006,"Robert Altman is a director of unique style and skill which he deftly demonstrates in this all-star period piece  he is Martin Scorsese without violence  both wield the same sort of 'documentary' realism approach through gliding steadicams but with very different content. Where Scorsese plunges into gritty crime-infested streets, Altman shifts his setting onto something infinitely more pleasant: an off-London country estate in November 1932, filled with lords, ladies, counts and their servants and peppered with upper-class rapid-fire dialogue.The ensemble is largely at focus, consisting of a multitude of mostly British actors. The camera dawdles and intimately stalks these people during 2 days or so  whether they are lords or maids  expertly navigating every little detail of their lives from the plates that they use to the silk boas that they wear. Naturally, this invests the film with the utmost cozy atmosphere. What is most admirable is that Altman somehow lets us thoroughly get to know ALL of his characters, in spite of there being so many and in spite of ultimately mostly offering us trivial details about them. Although there is no protagonist, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and Clive Owen all tip over into this territory at several points in the film, only to be firmly placed in the backseat once against to make room for other characters in the country estate. Their interactions are wonderfully dynamic; their dialogue snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace.So is there a story at all? Why yes, certainly. 'Gosford Park' is embroidered in intrigue that delicately interweaves all its characters; central to the events is a murder that takes place at midnight. Perhaps the reason why Altman follows his ensemble around everywhere they go so patiently in the film is in search for an answer: who was the murderer? What were their motives? Gosford Park undoubtedly offers much to choose from  pride, envy, snobbery, lost love, greed... and more. Yet, much like Scorsese, you get the feeling many scenes do not really surve any purpose other than to give us a feel for the way things are run or to establish the atmosphere. This is the prototype for such a film and it handles it extremely well with a meticulous eye for detail in setting, style and content.8 out of 10",Gosford Park
96,majikstl,Whodunit? Why bother!,7,24 March 2004,"One should never expect Robert Altman to do the obvious, so when he tackles a genre, he usually goes the long way around and ends up someplace else. His war movie, M*A*S*H, is a black comedy. His musical, NASHVILLE, ends up being a political drama. His satire of Hollywood, THE PLAYER, is a facade for an amoral film noir. So when Altman tackles the classic murder mystery formula, a la Agatha Christie, one is apt to be intrigued by the possibilities. The murder mystery is, by nature, the most structured of all genres in that it is actually a game that is played by the filmmaker and the audience. Whodunit and howtheydidit are the film's secrets that the viewer must discover. Therefore, there are unwritten rules. One must expect Altman to break the rules, yes; ignore them, no.As is, GOSFORD is less a whodunit than an obvious essay on class distinctions. Indeed, for all it is worth the whole murder mystery angle could have been forgotten all together. Having rounded up a remarkable cast of Britain's finest actors, Altman gives them precious little to do: Those upstairs set around being arrogant and bored, those downstairs stand around being bitter and stuffy. Along the way, there is a murder and no one seems to care.Therein lies the fatal wound. Everyone treats the killing as if it is, at best, a dreadfully uncouth faux pas, not the social embarrassment it should be for the aristocrats and the threat to the livelihood that it should present for the servants. Okay, that's the joke: a murder of an important person who no one will really miss. But if the murder mystery is inconsequential, then Altman owes us a distraction that would also make us indifferent to the violence. He does not deliver.The obvious model for this film is Jean Renoir's classic THE RULES OF THE GAME, a similarly themed film, rich with colorful characters, intriguing plot twists and a general air of orchestrated chaos. Altman's exercise in class confrontation doesn't even come close to matching Renoir's: Indeed, it doesn't even come close to matching Altman's own ramshackle satire A WEDDING. A few of Altman's mighty cast, such as Maggie Smith and Jeremy Northram, manage to infuse their roles with a bit of color, but most just seem bored. So will the viewer.",Gosford Park
97,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Exactly what you want it to be.,7,22 December 2011,"Gosford Park started out like Robert Altman's other ensemble pieces for me, so many characters that felt the same colliding in this overwhelming cluster that I couldn't find a place for myself in. However while his other works of the many-casted variety pushed me further and further away as they went on, this did the opposite and managed to bring me in more and more.His technique in shooting this was remarkable and absolutely perfect for the setting in which the story is staged. By having two cameras constantly moving at all times, it truly felt as though we were absorbed into the middle of this early 20th century English house, becoming a part of the gossip and the class disputes. I don't think a film of this nature could have been directed any better than how Altman did it.The thing that holds it back a lot for me is the script, which piles on way too many characters so the thing can never properly gain it's footing. The overall experience felt properly done but there were just too many people. Even at the end of the film there were times where two characters would be talking and they'd mentioned someone and I would have no idea who they were talking about. The (mostly) tremendous cast manages to make up for a lot of this, by bringing great depth without a lot of screen time, but it still feels like this would have been better suited with a longer duration. A lot of the more integral dynamics feel underdeveloped, despite the best effort of the cast.I also had a problem with how closed off the whole thing was. It couldn't (re: shouldn't) have been done any other way, but the muteness kept me at a distance for the whole thing, so in some of the more emotional moments my reaction wasn't as strong as it could have been.Still, there's much, much more to admire here than there is to criticize. Altman's technique is tremendous and he was able to gather together a fine ensemble cast to play out these cold creatures. Helen Mirren is heartbreaking, Kristin Scott Thomas is always the perfect bitch, Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald bring a human touch to the piece and Clive Owen again demonstrates that he has a lot of talent that he hasn't been putting to proper use lately. A good film that has some writing flaws that prevent it from being a great one.",Gosford Park

It is similar to the movie <<Death of the Nile River>>, however, it does not have the same intense feeling which you want to find out who is the real killer.It is a good nostalgic if you ever miss the good by-gone England era. The director did a good job of describing the two entirely different classes. However, I feel that in his eyes, the servants should be thankful that they have masters to serve. I was confused as who really killed the man, and I am not even sure if the actual killer was revealed at the end. Or maybe I was confused due to those british accent.",Gosford Park
99,smakawhat,Ah those secrets...,8,23 January 2002,"I am usualy not one to enjoy costume dramas, but luckily this one doesn't take place in a pre Victorian era.  But that isn't what made me enjoy this film immensley, it was the use of several interesting characters each with their own charm and appeal.This must have been just a laborious task to make this film, there are many actors and the story gives each one a chance to get to know the audience. It seemed like this could create a chance for disaster but every actor shines.Essentialy the film is a look at class stuffed England in the 30's with the homeowners living the life of tea and crumpets, and fancy dinners, while the servants tend to their needs and whims.  Of course the servants are all privy to their gossip, but of what use is it, one of them remarks 'Why should we live our lives through them?'As the film continues eventually a guest is murdered, and a preverbiale 'Clue' scene and Agatha Christie who-dunit ensues.  But the real joy of the film is just the characters and how the murder itself releases all the secrets of everyone in this glorious huge castle setting.At one point in the film I just didn't even care who the murderer might have been, I was just so enchanted with the behavior and manners of all the people in this film even at 2 1/2 hours length.  This movie is also very funny and has some classic dialogue most of it coming from Maggie Smith as a snobish old Countess.  Eg..Countess: So in your film that you are making someone gets murdered so who did it?Director: Oh well I wouldn't want to tell you that would spoil the film.Countess: Well I mean really, It's not like anyone here is going to see it.The film is just full of surprises, but I think a lot of American audiences will just not get it and be even confused perhaps by some of the dialogue and accents.

100,flingebunt,A comedy without jokes,5,23 May 2005,"Gosford park is lot like watching a comedy in which there are no jokes. Which is actually not really a bad thing because the most brilliant comedies can be enjoyed without having to laugh (the first time I watched Peter Seller's ""Being There"" I was blown away, but I didn't laugh at any of the jokes).Gosford Park is an upstairs/downstairs murder mystery set in an English manor house. The problem of course is to introduce some twists into this rather old theme, such as the true relationship between the wealthy and the servants, an American film producer and a totally incompetent detective. All played in a comic way, despite the lack of jokes.What we end up with is a movie with little to say about people you just don't really care about, and of course it takes a long to say nothing.Perhaps those who were fans of those old Agatha Christie novels and movies will love this, but to me it was a lot of sauce for too little meat.",Gosford Park

A Hollywood director, researching a murder whodunit set in a Manor House like this one with the same class of people, has also wrangled his way in there. The Lord of the Manor, excellent performance from Michael Gambon, is not well liked, of course, and it isn't long before he has a knife sticking out of him and the entire party is now suspect in his murder. But who did it, and why?""And Then There Were None"" (1945) and ""Knives Out"" (2018) are two similar films, one before and one after this one, that came to mind while watching ""Gosford Park"", directed by Robert Altman, the director of one of my favourite movies nonetheless, ""Streamers"". Both of those aforementioned films deal with a similar story and setting and both are far better than ""Gosford Park"", which sucked me right in from the start and charmed me with an attractive ensemble that includes Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Clive Owen, Kelly Mcdonald and a class performance from Stephen Fry. But the film labours on, really demands your attention as it cries ""look at me"", when really you have seen it all before in other films like the ones I mentioned earlier, aswell as in any Agatha Christie adaptation. It's just not as special as it seems to think it is. Much like the characters it portrays, it reeks of pretention. The ending is completely unsatisfactory, as the film confirms to the viewer that it really was just going through the motions and was nothing more than a costume parade.",Gosford Park

Plot development is distracted to say the least.The interior set seemed claustrophobic to me too many people too small of spaces.Mostly the thing is boring. A murder happens after about an hour of endless group scenes..the kitchen the dining table blah blah blah.....Altman was 77 when he made this turkey.

108,Christopher_Reid,Rather boring and pointless.,4,23 April 2007,"This is the most disappointing movie I've seen in recent memory. I was expecting it to be entertaining, not necessarily great or even memorable but at least engaging and interesting.Gosford Park succeeds in going nowhere for over 2 hours. For a comedy/crime/drama/mystery there isn't much comedy, crime, drama or mystery. Most of the characters seem like cardboard cut-outs: they aren't given any depth whatsoever. This isn't the fault of the actors but of the script (and the over abundance of uninteresting characters). This would be forgivable if Gosford Park was entertaining (ie. funny or mysterious), but it's not.I think the main problem with Gosford Park is that nothing happens. The acting is fine, the directing is fine, ... but nothing happens. The characters have no arcs: they interact, but virtually none of them change during the course of the movie. They don't even face any personal conflicts. In fact, the movie as a whole lacks conflict.As a crime/mystery, Gosford Park could have worked. Even if the characters weren't very deep or interesting (and don't change), a surprising twist and some good dramatic scenes could have made a pretty good movie, but Robert Altman doesn't even try.Perhaps the point of Gosford Park was to be a realistic period piece with a wide variety of different characters (who sometimes talk over the top of each other! How realistic!) If that is the case then I think it succeeds but without a story it all seems rather pointless.",Gosford Park

Yes, there's a murder, but finding out who did it isn't really that important. This is more a movie about class distinction. One of my favorite scenes involves Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) singing. The different reactions to him from the ""below the stairs"" people compared to the ""above the stairs"" people is quite telling. There were many times that I laughed out loud. This truly was an intelligent, entertaining movie. I own the DVD and have watched this several times. Each time I see a new subtlety that I missed before. All of the actors are top notch and they each add their own wonderful nuance to the story.

110,kurosawakira,Skillfully Written and Atmospheric,8,25 November 2013,"Great to see right after ""The Trial"" (1963), master Welles' film. Altman, like Welles, uses the movement of the camera in the most adventurous ways, and in this respect alone this is a great ride. The camera moves so effortlessly amongst people it's exhilarating to watch. The hallways, corners, doors and the stairs. Everything is so beautifully dynamic.Not to mention that this is skillfully written and atmospheric. Most of the film is all about the dynamics between the people and how the camera, being one of them, sets in to the house. So we also as an audience are given our time to get acquainted with the labyrinth of a house, the corridors, stairs and especially the two overlapping lives of the people involved: the masters above and their servants below. The great mystery is ultimately solved so elliptically that we realize it wasn't even the real mystery of the film to begin with. And of course there's the self- referential stuff of an actor playing a servant, and a film-producer making a Charlie Chan crime mystery into which the reality they're trying to emulate transforms itself.My favourite Altman by far.",Gosford Park
111,TuckMN,The Truly Unpleasant Lord McCordle,9,24 January 2002,"What if you had a murder and nobody cared?So many people, so much happening and only 137 minutes to deal with all of it.Perfect Servant -- this phrase come up late in the film and it would seem to be a badge of honour. And this is a near perfect movie.Imagine `Upstairs, Downstairs' with just a touch of Monty Python' and a little Agatha Christie thrown into the mix and you will come close to what this film is all about.There are so many characters it is near impossible to single any one of them out -- but some deserve mention above the rest.Maggie Smith (Constance, Countess of Trentham), Derek Jacobi (Probert [Sir William's Valet]), and most especially Kelly McDonald as Constance's Maid all turn in stellar performances in a film in which it is difficult to single out any one actor.Maggie Smith is the stereotypical landed gentry -- she has no idea that she truly believes that she is superior to `the working class.'  She even says that she 'doesn't have a snobbish bone in her body.'  And I am sure that she believes that -- it simply is not true.Derek Jocobi looks great -- better than ever.  He is an enourmously talented actor and can portray every character from servants to emperors and do it without flaw.The key to the entire plot lies with the character that Kelly McDonald (Mary Macreachran [Constance's Maid]) plays...  She is wise beyond her outward appearance and more worldly than even her own mistress would suspect.  A truly fine performance by a gifted actress.  I want to see more of her.Stephen Fry is the hint of 'Monty Python' as the police detective that can't even get his name out without interruption.  The entire case hinges upon him and we all know that he is not really up to the job.The music was splendid; evoking the period the film was set in and enhancing every scene.

The cast is very large, and at just one viewing becomes a little hard to grasp all the intrigue, but my advice is to see it at least a second time and the real enjoyment will flow. The differences between the rich and the ""downstairs"" teams are well portrayed, and everything is extremely believable except for the utterings and actions of the Police Inspector who is made to look far too ridiculous to be real.

113,dkncd,"Where are you, Agatha?",7,23 May 2007,"Gosford Park's marketing implied that it was a mystery in the style of Agatha Christie mysteries. At the beginning it seems to fit with this profile as an array of guests make their way to a large house in the English countryside. However, as the film progresses, it becomes apparent that this is not a mystery in the Agatha Christie sense, rather it is primarily focused on showing the lives of the characters in great depth and highlighting class distinctions in Britain as they were in the 1930s.The film has a number of good points. Sets and costumes were very well-crafted and impressive. The film was well-scored and particularly notable was the ditties sung by Ivor Novello while he played the piano. Notable performances come from a great cast and the film has its brilliant moments, particularly when we learn key details about the shrouded characters.However, observing the rituals of the house in between the film's top moments became tedious. The film seemed to be picking up steam when the promised murder took place. However, the last part of the film ultimately did not gain significant momentum after the murder. Stephen Fry's character was amusing initially when he could not seem to speak his full name without being interrupted, but his bumbling approach to investigating the murder was unfortunate. However, the movie does provide an interesting conclusion as the final details of key characters are revealed.Gosford Park is well-filmed, but the fact that the mystery aspect is deemphasized relative to exploring the conventions of the house left me disappointed. If you are looking for an Agatha Christie type mystery, look elsewhere. But if a thorough exploration of English society and class distinctions in 1930s Britain appeals to you, see Gosford Park.",Gosford Park

There's the people upstairs and the people downstairs and the bridges between them are flimsy.It's not a 'Romeo and Juliet' type situation, it's much more pervasive. The divide between classes exists deep in the characters' minds and we are shown various results of it. The time frame is in the 1930's, so the old systems are starting to be viewed with criticism, especially by the American outsiders.There's a murder, but it's not especially important and happens late in the movie.

115,Benjamin_Cox,"A slow, thoroughly British look at class and country life with a bit of murder thrown in - 86%",9,25 September 2013,"While it's never floated my boat, ""Downton Abbey"" nevertheless has plenty of fans as over nine million UK viewers caught the premiere of its third season on TV. It might well be a well-produced drama of the sort the UK excels at but personally, I find such costumed outings rather dour, plodding affairs. However, this movie - with its Agatha Christie-style country house and a cast-list for the ages - offers something a little different. It still feels a little slow but it offers an authentic look at class, privilege and gender politics. It's also brilliantly written, directed and performed and is probably Roger Altman's best film after ""MASH"".In 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his trophy wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas) invite a number of guests over for a shooting weekend. Among their guests are matinée idol Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and his Hollywood producer friend Morris Weissman (co-producer Bob Balaban) as well as the Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid-servant Mary (Kelly MacDonald). As the weekend goes on, Sir William has to fend off constant attempts to secure his fortune from his guests while the gossiping house-staff, led by his butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren), ensure that the weekend goes as smoothly as possible. Before long, a murder is committed but who is the guilty party? Is it head house-maid Elsie (Emily Watson) who has something to hide? Could it be enigmatic valet Mr Denton (Ryan Phillippe) or charismatic loner Parks (Clive Owen), the valet of Lord Stockbridge (Charles Dance)? Hopefully, Inspector Thomson (Stephen Fry) and his constable companion Dexter (Ron Webster) can crack the case before all the guests have to return home...Like most murder mysteries, ""Gosford Park"" spends a lot of time filling the screen with details both relevant and irrelevant. In fact, the murder is arguably the most surprisingly thing about the film as so much time is spent with both upstairs with the party-goers and downstairs with the staff that it almost feels like a documentary at times. To prevent boredom from completely taking over, the film injects a good deal of humour into proceedings - Smith's cantankerous countess is witty and loaded with barbed asides while Fry's detective is as gloriously aloof as those he interviews, maintaining an almost Clouseau-like ignorance of the facts presented to him. But all the cast are superb - I've never seen this many British stars at once outside of a Harry Potter film - but this is a true ensemble piece as dialogue blends together to further enhance the authentic feel of the film. The script, penned by ""Downton Abbey"" creator Julian Fellowes, leaves just enough to keep you guessing but because it spends so long setting the crime up, you sort of feel as though he's more concerned about writing a period piece as opposed to a mystery.Although it won't be to everyone's taste, ""Gosford Park"" feels like a big-screen outing for Mrs Marple but without the silver-haired sleuth in attendance. Yes, it's brilliantly made and at times very funny but I wanted a bit more pace to proceedings. I honestly felt that once every red herring imaginable had been planted in the first hour-and-a-bit, Fellowes simply worked out yet another possibility and wrote that as the ending. And to be frank, the climax felt a little rushed and the least believable bit of the picture as nobody actually seems that bothered that they've spent the weekend with a murderer in their midst. Still, credit must go towards the look of the film which is spot-on and the actors who are all magnificent. In truth, the film is less a murder-mystery and more a realistic portrayal of life in a country house in the early 1930's. Fellowes almost feels nostalgic for such a time when ladies knew their place, their men could be utter cads without them batting an eyelid and both were wholly reliant on their staff, who held them in mock-respect as though their livelihoods depended on it - which they did, of course. It is as British as Earl Grey tea, cucumber sandwiches and strawberries and cream at Wimbledon - something which appeals more to foreign markets more than the UK where I'm from. After all, if the TV series ""Midsomer Murders"" can be a global hit...",Gosford Park
116,saarvardi,"Gosford Park is one of the slowest, pointless, dullest, unsatisfying experiences I've had at the cinema",1,28 July 2007,"I saw Gosford Park in theaters way back in April 2002, after it was nominated for a slew of Academy Awards a month earlier. Naturally, I was looking forward for some good social satire in the shape of the always reliable ""clash of the classes"" theme. Robert Altman had the right pedigree as a director, and I actually liked some of his previous works such as The Player and Dr. T and the Women, so there was some cause for interest there. Also, this was promoted as a story of a classic old Hollywood murder mystery, another motivation to go see it. Boy was I wrong. I can't even start to explain how many things went wrong for me upon watching this train-wreck of a film. For starters, the film was way too talky - not that its bad, but in this case, the endless discussions never actually reached a point. Also, it was very hard to relate to the belated ensemble cast, given the fact they were mostly made up of actors portraying pretentious and extremely dull English snobs, who lead a decadent and obsolete way of life. The movie didn't make me care for any of the characters, want to learn more about them and what motivates them, or give any further attention to their boring tea parties, hunting trips or twisted relations with their butlers and maids.At one point of the film I just began looking at my wrist watch, trying as hard as I can not to fall asleep, waiting for the promised murder mystery to occur so there would be some sort of force of interest to push the plot forward. After all, there is a certain degree of patience one can bare when staring helplessly at yawn-inducing characters talking about ever so boring issues. I felt as though the film was just going on and on with no real plot or point to look forward to at the end of the tunnel. When the foul felony finally took place, I was apathetic towards whatever was happening, that I couldn't care less. It was THAT bad.Thankfully, I gave Altman another chance and really enjoyed A Prairie Home Companion, his final work before passing away. However, that still doesn't erase the fact that Gosford Park is one of the slowest, pointless, dullest, unsatisfying experiences I've had at the cinema. I'm usually into dramas, and I have an incredibly low bar of entertainment  even the most overused clichés in films tend to amuse me the slightest bit. Alas, Gosford park was just a step too far, even for my relatively low standards; as this now sits as one of the worst films I've seen of this decade to date.I gave it a 1/10.",Gosford Park
117,Kakueke,Whoofmany dun it?,6,1 March 2002,"Good climax and twist at the end, but I thought this was not as enjoyable as the stuff on A&E because there were too many suspects/characters (all those servants plus the society types). Too much, too involved, hard to get people's names.  I would also have liked the murder to occur sooner (I timed it, but I won't tell how far into the movie it occurred.)  I'm more into the plot/mystery itself, not overdone British gossip, personal intrigues, etc. But still OK, and people who are into the genre will enjoy this film a lot.",Gosford Park
118,diand_,Construction and execution,6,13 July 2005,"Altman seems to be one of the best directors for big ensemble pieces like this. But this is not in the same category as Short Cuts. The overall construction is more intelligent, but the execution is not. First, we are literally thrown in the movie. Short scene after scene are meant to introduce us to the characters, but there are too many: A human can only chunk about 7 unconnected elements, and as a connection is only made after half an hour or so, a lot of facts are missed on first viewing. Second, the resolution is woven into the story, but is only a very minor part of it. Although it is common in a mystery to give some facts that are useless and serve as a decoy, this is almost built out of unnecessary additions. Thus it is not only overlong with too many side notes, they become more irrelevant for the viewer during the movie. So in the last part we have the reverse of the beginning: Almost everything is known; we can easily see what's important and what's not so it becomes somewhat boring.Still interesting are other ideas: a movie-maker (also American) is thrown in to add a layer to the story. And his not too British servant (an American playing a Scot) as his observer.",Gosford Park
119,adrongardner,The Mysterious Affair of Altman,8,1 April 2012,"Delightfully odd is what I call Gosford Park. Without getting as picky as many other reviews floating around, I'd say this cross of an Agatha Christie Ms. Marple mixed with Howard's End. Even then, I'm making it seem quite dark - which it isn't. This is the most entertaining ensemble piece I've seen in a very long time and Altman has an effortless touch with so many legendary actors crammed into an old house around a dead body.In a sense, there's almost too much going on for the film's own good. In the last third, some characters drift in and out of the narrative simply because the plot gets in the way which is a disappointment compared to the first chunk of the film. Before the body turns up, it's less a forced setup for suspects than a supreme exercise in just hanging out. Howard Hawks made a western in the same style with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson called Rio Bravo. There too do we get caught up in the daily musings and sing song of some old friends locked in a jail house. There too does the film lose steam when the story gets in the way. But here, one must congratulate Altman for corralling so much talent and funneling it into something genuinely entertaining and, at times, even absorbing.Gosford Park is a victim of it's quality. There's so much to see and so much to tell, when he gets around to making a movie out of it, it's just not as interesting as what came before. Even so, there's few other movies I've seen in the last 20 years that offer so much for your time.",Gosford Park
120,Jim Tritten,Good but this is not a classic mystery,8,13 January 2002,"Gosford Park has certainly received more than a fair share of hype. It is a good movie -- not a great movie -- but to say that you can watch it as a classic mystery is misleading. Tea at four, dinner at eight -- yes -- but it is well after midnight before we have a murder. The picture is a visual feast and the acting superb. The story is very unusual but might better be described as excellent social commentary with an embedded death in the family. To say more would be to give away the ""who done it"" which would be better enjoyed by watching the screen. When you do get to the end, you will probably want something more.",Gosford Park
121,martin-fennell,Altman at his best,10,15 April 2018,"Altman is at his best in this suberb mix of comedy, drama and mystery.Maggie Smith steals the film, but not effortlessly.

122,AZINDN,Entertainment at its best,10,28 April 2006,"Gosford Park is one of the finest films and provides comments by director Robert Altman and screenwriter, Julian Fellowes, as well as a documentary on filming the film, out takes, and filmography data. Fellowes comments however, are wonderful insight to the history of English country house weekends, the arrogance of classism in British social history, as well as providing delightful remembrances of the author's own relations from whom he drew heavily developing his characters.This is a film of seamless performances from every actor and underscores the strength of theatrical training in the British system over Hollywood's studio celebrity system. A little bit Agetha Christie, but not really, the story of a dismal weekend in the country is made all the better by Altman's direction, or his ability to direct without interference in his actor's performances.Stellar performances include Maggie Smith (Prime of Miss Jean Brody), delightful as the Countess without a pot to p*#s in, Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective), the victim of greedy in-laws and dog-haters, Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello delivers blissful musical entertainment to guests and audience alike, Emily Watson (Metroland) demonstrates why she is one of the best young actors working today, and the wonderful Helen Mirren and sexy Clive Owen are mysterious players in the upstairs-downstairs dilemma. The depth of cast talent is akin to an archaeology dig, it just keeps getting better as time passes.Gosford Park is a film that makes film watching a pleasure. In the hands of excellent players, a director who knows how to stage shots, and with a screen play that is both witty and informed, the audience can't loose. This is one of the best films of the year, it should be included in every film buff's library. Pass the martini tray, Geeves.",Gosford Park
123,Camoo,Wow! Made for multiple viewings...,10,8 April 2007,"How, oh how does he do it? The more Altman I consume, the less I understand his technique. It's almost mystical, his ability to extract certain performances and certain moments from his actors, and somehow keep perfect control over seeming spontaneity. I could only imagine his sets to be the most chaotic events, the camera is somehow everywhere at once while also being nowhere, but there is a containment of this wild energy at work that I totally fail to understand. That kind of feat is AWESOME, how the thread co-operates through this film from the first shot to the last, all the while maintaining the most spectacular production design and cinematography, elements that must have taken a lot of time to get right, but seem somehow effortless. I won't get much into the plot, but if you know Altman you'll know there are a lot of interlocking stories with a colorful cast of characters who might or might not be innocent and who might or might not be who they really seem to be. He was robbed on this one by Ron Howard and his dreck flick 'A Beautiful Mind' at the Oscars!",Gosford Park
124,howie73,Upmarket Agatha Christie,7,9 January 2005,"Altman's bravura take on the 1930s English country house murder is not all it seems. Starting as a study of class divisions, it soon slides its swift lens to the mutual dependent worlds of master and servant, slowly yet surely exposing the links that bind both seemingly disparate worlds. What's most engaging about Altman's approach is his fluid camera-work. There are so many nuances to be had in what we see that most require multiple viewings to decipher each. The rich tapestry of English actors is excellent to behold and brings the hitherto formulaic Agatha Christie to life but the slightly heavy-handed socio-political comment spoils it a bit; the rich are all too often portrayed as caricatures (with the exception of Maggie Smith's character); while the only American is baffled by such class divisions - not that class snobbery was ever an issue in 1930s America of course! I was disappointed I guessed the mystery ending well before the end. By creating mystery and revealing it at the end, the film falls into the genre it tried to subvert.",Gosford Park
125,Ishallwearpurple,Wonderful Time for Mature Audiences,9,19 February 2002,"For three older women at a matinee performance with a theater almost full of mature people, we all had a wonderful time.  This is a film in the grand tradition of witty, nuanced, intricate stories of the time of the film, the 1930's.  We had no trouble understanding the dialog and laughed our heads off in some places.The point of view of the film is though the eyes of the servants and what a view they have of these dolts who dress beautifully, but are mostly rotten to the core.The opening scene shows the poison bottles, and they keep cropping up so we know that we will have dead body at some point, but that is not the point of the story.  It is just an incident among many at this country weekend.All the actors have a scene or two to shine but they all keep themselves in check so it comes off as a wonderful ensemble piece.  Have to give credit to Altman for pulling it off once again.The wonderful ""look"" of the film is perfect; the clothes, jewelry, the rooms upstairs and downstairs, and the great cars - it is all a joy to behold. Definitely of the three nominated films I have seen, this one and ""A Beautiful Mind"" are both worthy.  Thumbs up!!",Gosford Park

By the end of the movie, you no longer really cares who committed the dark dead (which takes quite a while to take place - too much setting-up of characters and events) or why.Would've made a fine novel, with the depth to get into the characters, but it is a disappointing movie.Worth seeing for a magnificent cast who give fabulous performances however, and the camp knowing dialogue.",Gosford Park

Other examples of this genre are Last Summer in the Hamptons and the much misunderstood Scenes from the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills.Sensational casting makes the production gel like solid aspic - Kristin Scott Thomas and Alan Bates are particularly brilliant, but Maggie Smith also raises the acting to some starry heights.  Downs are rare - Stephen Fry seeming to be inspired by Jacques Tati is bad characterisation rather than bad acting.Overall, however, the main heavy-handedness is in the over-emphasis on the callous disregard of the masters for their servants.

With a standout performance of unequaled simmering sexuality by Emily Watson, this is a incredible look into a bygone era and a clash between both cultures and classes. The script deserved the Oscar it won and certainly the ensemble award from SAG can not be argued with. However, Emily Watson should have received an Oscar nomination for setting the screen on fire once again with a performance that proves what a truly gifted actor she is. The way she captures the flesh and blood of her character is astonishing and as an example of some of her earlier work, it shows prophetically the path of greatness she has followed throughout her cinema career.

133,JackCerf,Jeeves's Memoirs,5,6 January 2002,"An interesting and very well made country house weekend genre piece, but unfortunately it falls well short of its prototype, The Rules of the Game. The fault is in Julian Fallowes's clichéd script, which is P.G. Wodehouse without the funny bits. Every member of the upper crust is merely a twit, a cad, a fraud, a boor and/or a snob. We are invited at first to sympathy with the host, a nouveau riche industrialist of intelligence, energy and ability, but he turns out to be more vile in his own way than the genteel parasites who cluster around him. There isn't the slightest redeeming human quality in any of them. Only below stairs is any humanity to be found. If Jeeves had vented all his spleen in a memoir after 30 years of valeting for Bertie Wooster, it would have read something like this script.Renoir understood three things to which Fallowes and Altman seem tone deaf. First, even people cursed with having been born to privilege, or some of them,can be decent and interesting human beings within the conventions of their caste. Second, the conventions of the pre-capitalist aristocracy, however decayed they had become, put a high value on the personal virtues of courage, honor and integrity. Third, in a system where class lines are clearly drawn and well understood, there can be a peculiar personal intimacy between master and servant. Because Renoir grasped these things, Rules of the Game was complex. Because Fallowes does not, Gosford Park is only complicated.The script simply has no patience with these people. Its undergraduate radical view of the upper class means that it misses some of the dramatic opportunities inherent in an aristocracy on its last legs. Freddie Nesbitt would be a more interesting swine, and Commander Meredith a more desperate pathetic failure, if one of the other upper class males, Lord Stockbridge for instance, exemplified the standard they had failed to live up to. Isobel, Sir William's daughter, is thrown away as a character because Altman doesn't use her relationship with Elsie, the Head Housemaid, to open her up. Even a few minutes of dialog between Elsie and Sir William would have gotten us under his surface. But Altman simply doesn't want to get under the surface of the people above the stairs. He is interested in only the servants as human beings, Those they serve, like the American guests at the Jamaican hotel in Smile Orange, are just a ridiculous but burdensome part of the environment in which the lives of the real people go on.",Gosford Park
134,zendatrim,"A mish mash of different Genres, never settling on one",8,19 September 2017,"I was looking forward to this, and bought the DVD and when it arrived was full of excitement to see it, because it had such great reviews. Perhaps i was spoilt as i had not long binge watched, downton abbey, upstairs downstairs 1976 and the recent one in 2010 set in the same period as Gosford Park. I found the beginning so confusing. It took me a little while to understand what was going on and ages to realise that Sir William had a daughter it got kind of lost in confusion, the only saving grace for me was Maggie Smith. The plot slowly and agonisingly started to develop BUT 3/4 way in i wondered what I was watching. Was it meant to be serious? The same old banal issues with upstairs downstairs servants v masters etc. I likened it to:Downton Abbey Upstairs Downstairs 13 for Dinner by Agatha Christie Nancy Drew (the young maid worked it out) Inspector Clouseau (the bungling inspector played by Colin Fry)I did giggle at Colin Fry.I struggled to believe a maid would get a blouse dry if washed by hand at midnight so she could witness the randy maid with a member of aristocracy making nooky over a kitchen table.Since when did Americans have Valets Henry Denton was obviously playing a part? Lady Sylvia has an assignation with him and a glass of hot milk, yawn. I am sorry I really didn't enjoy it, it was so drawn out and confusing it did not keep my attention, and when Sir William was killed i thought oh goody something has happened. Its only then we find out that Sir William was a profiteer in the war and made woopee with the workers and had numerous children one of whom was a valet to one of the visitors at the shoot, and it turned out although he thought his mother had died she was actually Mrs Wilson the housekeeper who saw the photo of herself when she was young, and realised he was her son, but didn't bother to reveal herself. The only saving grace was Mary who worked for the countess of trentham (Maggie Smith) and Elise. I really did try to like this but alas it just made me switch off my brain. I think its because I wasn't sure what it was supposed to be, serious, funny, mystery it never seemed to find its place.",Gosford Park

I suppose my expectations were of something more wild and wicked. Except for the wonderful Maggie Smith, I found the cast so serious and stern, not really very funny or unique, nor did I find the story (what I could follow of it) particularly engaging. I think because I did not like the cast, I really didn't care about the story. Certainly they were fine actors, but they just weren't much fun.

Robert Altman is a brilliant director and a master of camera movement but the truth is that his films miss more often than hit. I'm afraid this is one of the former. There are too many potentially interesting characters and their depiction becomes necessarily stereotypal and the story seems interminably long. Good performances don't help Altman's generalization that the wealthy and sophisticated can be just as dull and petty as the lower classes since we all know or should know that and films of this magnitude and budget should at least try to be entertaining. The wit and cynicism that characterizes Altman's work when he strings together connecting vignettes, such as he did in ""Shortcuts"", is missing here. It is nice to watch good performers at work but this film should be used for instructional purposes in a film school rather served up to the ticket paying general public. The murder mystery turns out to be too simple for the amount of time one tries to analyze the suspects",Gosford Park
137,Critical Eye UK,Stately pile,3,16 February 2003,"Everyone grows old. Even Altman. That isn't to say one of cinema's greatest masters has gone senile. . . but it does flag up the fact that 'Gosford Park' is, well, geriatric.The subject matter was never going to provide the edge of M.A.S.H or the wide sweep of Nashville. But it could (and should) have been much, much better.An 'Upstairs, Downstairs' reworking on the back of a pointless murder mystery, Gosford is as over-blown as it is over-praised. Altman's usual cinematic mechanics are all there, of course: the flowing camera work, the multi-narrative tracking. But here though, that's exactly what they are: mechanical. And. . . They don't work.Halfway thru the movie it's still difficult to figure out precisely who is who. Worse though, it's difficult to care, and as the script lurches downhill into one improbability after another an overwhelming sensation of boredom sets in, precipitated as much by the absence of plot credibility as character credibility: there are some in this ensemble with less substance than cardboard.An overload of any element in any movie is never a good thing, and 'Gosford Park' plainly bears it out: the cream of British acting may be present, but it's a cream that pretty soon curdles.At the end, then, one is drawn to the conclusion that the work of Altman and his collaborators is uncomfortably close to its subject matter, because the eponymous Gosford Park is, in British parlance, a stately pile, slowly mouldering away. . .As, indeed, is the movie.

138,Sjhm,"A good idea, somewhat awkwardly expressed.",6,11 March 2007,"I tuned in to watch this film, because England between the wars is a period that fascinates me, and the wealthy/aristocracy of this period are of particular interest. The film is set in 1932 at a shooting party in a country house, owned by a wealthy man who has made the crossover from trade to landed gentry. So in theory straight away you have a class tension. However, I found right from the start that the story itself seemed stiff and unnatural. For instance Henry would have been picked up straight away as incredibly insolent servant, and Mr Jennings would have had something to say about that.The casting was excellent, with several of Britain's best thespians being cast stunningly against type. I particularly enjoyed Richard E Grant's remarkably restrained performance, and Sir Derek Jacobi was superb too. Maggie Smith's performance was amazing, in probably the most irritating part of her long and illustrious career. I was somewhat at a loss to understand what Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) was actually doing at the party, unless it was simply an opportunity to use his music as part of the soundtrack, so it seemed a particularly awkward plot device used to introduce Weissmann into the house.This is not a bad movie, the period feels right and the performances rise above a story which does not go anywhere very quickly. I just found it a little long and somewhat clunky in parts. Enjoy it for its revealing interactions and ignore the odd awkward plot device that does not really make a great deal of sense.",Gosford Park
139,misctidsandbits,Drawing Room Drama of Epic Proportions,7,15 February 2012,"Reading reviews is one of the fun parts of watching a new (to you) movie. The biggest comedic relief of this reading is the reference by so many to this film as a comedy and/or mystery. It's a drawing room drama of near epic proportions. The producers/directors seemed to want to throw it all in, and the crime part of the thing surely was not intended to be taken seriously. Blake Edwards may have recognized that police inspector, but Agatha Christie would have shuddered. She didn't do comedies, and her detectives were expert and successful. And, how can this be a ""whodunit"" when they show you who did it?? Clearly, everyone connected with the project worked hard. And they got their ""A's"" for effort. And a big ""Q"" for quantity, but ""0"" for quality. No matter how much talent you assemble, rabbits pulled out of hats, it all just gets lost in the jabbering herd. A lot of people are referencing this movie right now because of the huge current following of PBS' ""Downton Abbey."" There are comparisons of site and theme and so forth. So, it sends one to or back to GP. It no doubt was ground breaking, in proportion at least, for its type and in its time -- but it has been majorly eclipsed with Abbey. Somehow, the more civil versions of this theme have surpassed offerings of this sort. You can scream artistic expression in many categories on this, but the period films (or other) that are the most revisited (and awarded as well) are not of this ilk. These characters don't live on. Who could even remember half of them? That's not the case with other period films of the type and subject, which have and are becoming classics, like ""Downton Abbey,"" one in the works - undeniably a smash hit.There's a problem today with confusing filthy talk and wholesale shoddy behavior with realism. Again, the characters that become real to people are not from films that attempt to standardize lower forms of human nature and expression. People have a way of wanting to spend their time and revisit works that reflect upward from dysfunction, with liberal sprinklings of sleaze. Sorry, but that's basically what you've got here. It may be a part of real life, but most people really aren't impressed by it, nor seek it as entertainment. ""Adult themes"" can be represented without being crammed down your throat. Applause to those with the artistic skill and human depth to bring that off. Unfortunately, that did not happen here. Innovative spectacle for its time -- a reach for a positive commentary.",Gosford Park
140,jhsteel,"Very satisfying, must be seen several times.",9,4 October 2004,"I have only seen Gosford Park once so far, so I haven't seen all the nuances that the other positive comments have described, but I recommend this film to those who are prepared to take time to watch human behaviour in painstaking detail and Altman's brilliant technique in telling a story that is much more complex than it first appears. You will be rewarded if you pay attention. I am fond of costume dramas and I think it's great that this film will probably attract an audience used to seeing adaptations of Jane Austen (and it's like a modern take on her wit and perception of social customs) who will then get more than they bargained for.I particularly enjoyed Jeremy Northam's singing which came as a total surprise to me; it was excellent and added emotional impact to the movie. The cast were all excellent and the overall impression that the action below-stairs was more important than that above-stairs was emphasised by the detective in his attitude to the importance of the servants and his blundering failure to solve the crime (a crime which of course wasn't the point of the story). In fact, as one reviewer pointed out, the effectiveness of those on either side of the class system was mirrored in the relation between the detective and his constable (who did know what he was doing). The final revelations explain everything beautifully and have enormous impact emotionally. It's a masterpiece and the writer deserves great credit too - the dialogue is excellent.",Gosford Park
141,dwr246,Fascinating look at England in the 1930's,9,11 April 2005,"If you've ever wondered how the other half lives, this film will give you a glimpse of it in all its splendor - and its seediness.Gosford Park is an interesting set piece, a look at a slice of life during a given time. The action centers around Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), who host a shooting party at their mansion, Gosford Park. Guests arrive for the weekend, bringing trusted servants with them, and we are presented with parallel stories of the lives of those above stairs, and those below. Intrigue abounds in both worlds, and their intersections occur in surprising places. When Sir William turns up dead, the suspects are many, and an investigation turns up a few secrets, but it is ultimately, Mary Maceachran (Kelly Macdonald), servant to Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith), who turns up the most surprising secret of all.The script contains a number of plots and subplots, all of which are handled with surprising alacrity. Points of view shift constantly, but not in a confusing way, and never to the detriment of the story. The investigation adds an interesting element to the story without overpowering it. And in the end, neither the servants nor the masters are presented as being the better world to belong to.The movie is an ensemble piece, and as such, boasts a number of strong performances without anyone overshadowing any of the others. Thomas is her usual ice princess, but since Lady Sylvia isn't especially likable, her performance works. Michael Gambon's gruffness works well for Sir William. Maggie Smith is wonderful as a pampered old woman, and Macdonald is equally charming as her inquisitive servant. Jeremy Northram is exceptional as Ivor Novello. Emily Watson is wonderful as a devoted servant whose accidental revelation of her indiscretions costs her her job. Helen Mirren's carefully controlled performance as Mrs. Wilson is well matched by Alan Bates' performance as Mr. Jennings. Eileen Atkins portrays Mrs. Croft with warmth and sympathy.For those looking for a linear story with a single plot line which is easy to follow, the movie may seem a little tedious. But for those willing to immerse themselves in the period and the people for awhile, this is a delightfully complex portrait of a world seldom seen by Americans.",Gosford Park

We are greeted with a quaint English setting as the cast rolls in magnificently regaled. Polish up your manners and tune your ear to the variety of British accents making me long for subtitles.The mystery wasn't a particularly difficult one to follow, but that's not the reason to see GP.  Complex relationships, intriguing characters and stunning accoutrements (costumes, setting, props) are the compelling reasons.You will see patronizing attitudes of up- for downstairs servant group. ""There's nothing more exhausting than breaking in a new maid. I should be paid"" and ""try to make her look presentable."" Can this barrier be overcome? When it is, the character is treated like a pariah by both sides. ""You can't play both teams at once"" as an interloper was advised.Altman succeeds in portraying more depth in the downstairs characters by at least three floors.  Is this American populist cynicism over the British caste system? Or should we reflect on our own?Regardless, Altman serves up a satisfying feast. Indulge yourself",Gosford Park

There were not five seconds in the entire film when I was not either fairly convulsed with the (often very black!) humor or staring with near disbelief at the re-creation of a bygone time and place made with such loving attention to detail that, faithful or not, the illusion is compelling enough to be scary.  I would see this movie again anyday, just for the visual aspect.  The way the camera seems to caress surfaces (peeling paint on doors, mud on overshoes, clothing fabric) reminds me of the reveling in textures in ""In the Mood for Love.""  I believe that if he'd never made another film, Robert Altman would have assured himself a name in the history of film with this one.",Gosford Park

It's just about the best thing of its kind, offering fascinating insights, not only into the various characters but also into the whole vanished world of English country houses and the complex cultures they contained, both upstairs and down. It turns out that even the tiniest details and bits of business in the film -- food and drink, clothing, pecking order, salutations, customs, rules of etiquette, etc. -- were carefully thought out and as authentic as Fellowes could make them. (He's also, for what it's worth, refreshingly generous when it comes to giving credit to his actors.)Altman also contributes a commentary on the DVD, but (like his commentary on ""Nashville"") it's quite disappointing. He sounds old, a bit dim, and a little past it, as if he hasn't seen the movie in years and has forgotten most of it. That's okay; ""Gosford"" is still, to my mind, his best movie, and we do have Fellowes to interpret it for us.",Gosford Park

I thought this was a murder mystery, The murder takes so long to happen I thought I was wrong and I was watching ""Remains of the Day"" again by mistake.Pros: 1) The contrast of the upstairs rich folk and the downstairs servants and the culture and how they overlap and how people keep secrets (that goes both way too).Cons: 1) It Drags on. 2) It's was really hard to understand a lot of the lines due to the strong English accents combined with actors that mumble a lot. 3) Very predictable.

I was so bored, it was painful. The first 45 minutes were excruciating with really bad dialogue - not a single line of any wit or interest. It was supposed to be a comedy. No one in the theatre laughed at any point. After the murder finally occurred, I thought things would pick up. But they didn't. With all the new technology out there in the electronics and photography industry, this movie looked like it was filmed with a 1960's camera - the resolution was dull and gray. The actors themselves seemed like they were sleepwalking. No energy, no emotion, no interesting conversation or characters. Boring, lifeless, apathetic drizzle. 2/10",Gosford Park
149,kira02bit,A complete waste of time and talent,3,17 December 2002,"A good indicator that Oscar voters have a perverse sense of humor. Undoubtedly if anyone but Robert Altman had perpetrated this film, it would have immediately fallen into oblivion.  A group of dreadfully uninteresting people gather at a 1930s English country manor, where the gossip is only momentarily halted by murder.  The film was marketed as a slightly comedic whodunnit, but there is nary a laugh to be had and the whodunnit seems almost an afterthought.  Even the view of social mores and how the working class were forced to vicariously live through the scandal provided by their ""betters"" feels like warmed-over Upstairs Downstairs.  Altman fans will probably be rabid in its defense, but there is really no legitimate reason for its being.  While it is somewhat amazing that Altman is able to introduce so many characters and keep a multi-tiered narrative from falling into total confusion, he has managed to do this in far more compelling films.  It takes virtually an hour to figure out who is who and by that point we realize that we would not want to know any of these people.  When the murder finally occurs, the characters are so unimpressed that there is no reason for the viewer to care either.  Incredibly, the older actors come off worse than the younger.  Clive Owen, Kelly McDonald and Ryan Phillipe (usually horrible) are decent in ill-defined roles.  Emily Watson provides the only full-bodied performance of the lot as a wronged maid.  Veterans like Alan Bates, Richard E. Grant and Derek Jacobi, among others, are virtually wasted.  Stephen Fry shows up two-thirds in as a bumbling inspector and not only seems to have walked on-set from another film altogether, but is embarrassingly bad to boot.  Of the Oscar nominees, Helen Mirren's nod is puzzling since she virtually plays an automaton for the duration of the film as a stoic head housekeeper, and Maggie Smith's acid-tongued shrew is surprisingly joyless and downright obnoxious.  The film fails as social commentary, fails at drama, fails at comedy and fails at mystery. And were Altman fans to be honest with themselves, I doubt very many of them would rank this high in his pantheon of cinematic work.",Gosford Park

The actual ""mystery"" takes up only a very small part of the film, which is severely overweighted by what turns out to be thoroughly useless character and situation set-up.  (In fact, this very brief part of the story seems to be from a different movie altogether- and indeed, a much more interesting one). The resolution, to use this term very generously, is very rushed and incomplete.  How this can be described as a ""comedy"" by any means is beyond me.

What this film shows brilliantly is the way a big house like Gosford Park worked, who ran it and how. As the rich get richer, butler seems like a sensible career goal. We learn far more about the Downstairs crew than the Upstairs - I never worked out who was who, let alone who was married to whom. What did the fair bloke with the ""common"" wife have on the daughter of the house? Who was having relations with the kitchenmaid? Not one of the Upstairs crowd, I think - he was wearing a tail coat and must have been one of the footmen. The revelations about Lord McC's past in Isleworth are clunky to say the least. One thing we do find out: these people may be rich, but they're not noble. Lord McC, it's hinted, is a war profiteer, and his guests talk business at the dinner table. Real toffs don't do that - they don't have jobs. As for the ""funny"" detectives - they just aren't, and they don't hack it as parody.",Gosford Park

I haven't heard any critics or any of the moviegoing public mention Rules, nor do I see the creative team from Rules listed among the writers of Gosford Park.  It's 90% Rules and 10% Clue.This film has, without a doubt, the longest stream of scenes before the first plot point is reached than any I've ever seen.  I defy anyone to name a film where said plot point happens later than AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES! In case you don't know, 99% of films have their first plot point between 25 and 30 minutes.  And 99.99% of all films ever made have had it before 40 minutes.  To not have it within these time frames is not right.  It's uncomfortable.  It doesn't feel right.  It gets boring.  One is supposed to have an idea of what the film they are watching is about before half of it is over.There are too many characters in this film, and that's the first time I've said that about an Altman film, and I've seen most of 'em.  The difference here is that they're all in the same place and parts of the same story, unlike Short Cuts or Nashville.  It's just too much.  It's impossible for me to give a damn about any of these characters (except the cute girl from Trainspotting), and therefore the whole story under these circumstances. It's just a mess, plain and simple.As for Rules of the Game, many consider it among the all time greats ever made, so if you liked Gosford Park, you should certainly give it a look.  It also takes place in a large mansion in a secluded place where a group of pretentions upper class European jerks bring their servants along for a weekend of pretention and game hunting.  Painful truths are revealed, murder takes place, and equal time is spent from the perspectives of both the upper and lower classes.As for me, I lump both films into my The Big Chill class of films. Everyone, even the most ardent film fan, has a type of film they can't stand, and this is mine, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.  But, man.

A good film HAS to have good dialogue, especially when it bills itself as a ""murder mystery."" If you cannot hear half of the dialogue, how are you supposed to figure out what is going on?

Brilliant, brilliant, do you see?Okay, in case you think I'm certifiable, I see I could be wrong and the Dickensian sob-story twist with Mrs. X is the true and final one--and all the other teasers, promises that ""I'd say anything if you asked me to,"" and such, are just parlour-game fun.On the serious side, I think only an American director such as Altman would outdo ""Upstairs, Downstairs"", taking the side of the servants most definitely and despising the declining-empire English for their insufferable arrogance and punishing class system.

It's like a very large version of Upstairs, Downstairs, except the staff is far more cynical and observant of the upper class than on that old television program. Yes, it's true that at times some of the dialog is hard to follow; most of the actors, oddly enough, are British, and understand how important the correct accent is for each character, each class.

158,tvspace,"Upstairs, Downstairs",6,15 January 2002,"As a fan of both Robert Altman and ""Jeeves and Wooster"" I expected this film to be a complete delight; the thought of combining Altman's storytelling ingenuity with an Agatha-Christie type murder mystery set in rural England seemed to promise a kinetic and witty movie that would cattily satirize the rather stale genre of English mysteries.Instead the film turns out to be a fairly straight genre picture, but not the genre that is advertized (a mystery), but rather a sitting room drama; a soap opera, even.  It is a nicely filmed but not especially well-written episode of Upstairs, Downstairs.This is not to say the film is without its merits.  It has a sweetness to it that is often missing from Altman's work, and more surprising, a modesty that doesn't leave many of the director's characteristic fingerprints on the finished product.The assembled cast must include every talented actor with a British accent, from Hellen Mirren to Kristin Scott Thomas to Michael Gambon to Stephen Fry (Jeeves himself, as a detective).  If you are an anglophile there is much here to enjoy.As far as the story itself, I was generally bored or confused, or both, by the extremely large and not especially differentiated cast of characters. This sense of sprawling confusion only adds to the effectiveness of Altman classics like Nashville and Shortcuts because it serves as an accurate represenation of those two mileaus (Shortcuts takes place in suburban Los Angeles) and additionally supports Altman's thematic approach to the material.  Here the parade of characters seems less a function of style or theme and more the symptom of an inability on the part of the filmmakers to distill what is essentially an intimite story down to its necessary parts. It feels like Altman wasn't sure if he was satirizing the English murder mystery, or making a drawing room romance, so we end up with sub-plots heading in opposite directions, most of them destined to remain completely unresolved.  The movie ends almost with a sense of surrender to the needless complication that has been sown throughout as the guests and their servants rush to get out of town, and the theatre patrons rush to get out of their seats, all gushing the same sigh of relief:  it's over.",Gosford Park

But, on second viewing, this time WITH captions for a hearing-challenged type, I finally realized that the Brits herein are as close to perfection as possible. How could they not be, with that lineup of thespians, stellar and bit? What I found offputting and mischievous were the Hollywood in-jokes about the Charlie Chan series, which never rose above B-minus status, either at the box office or in the inner sanctums of the anointed critical circuits of the day. From Warner Oland on, the Chan series were but a hop, step, or a jump beyond the likes of the Fu Msnchus, all of them irrelevant and unreal, as in ""Chu Chin Chow"" or Joseph Hergesheimer. That said, I must personally fault Altman for deliberately stepping on ""lines"" of dialog, even as the basic ""plot"" is more than threadbare and the cupboard of essence less than nourishing.

The first one are the owners of the house and the guests of a shooting party organised in ""Gosford Park"". The lower class is represented by maids, cooks and pages. This clear split has reminded me a 1970th British TV-series. Two actions in parallel are described and one character, a false page, builds up a bridge between the two classes. He is in reality an actor who wants to learn about that world. Nothing is missed, everything is there with a precise and maniacal description.

In fact, as several people have stated, I also didn't care whodunit... that would miss the point of this film.To compare it unfavorably to ""Clue"", a ridiculously bad film, is both insulting and misleading. If you want a murder mystery, go see something else. If you want a cleverly drawn British comedy with true heart and sentiment, then see ""Gosford Park"".

The actors had been doing a very good job of playing these stunted English people with their stiff upper lips firmly in place.

168,DesbUK,Country House Mystery with a 24 carat gold cast.,7,11 March 2009,"I've always regarded the American filmmaker Robert Altman as a terribly overrated director. Even a film like MASH is inferior to the TV show and NASHVILLE becomes tedious in its third hour, whilst POPEYE is painful to sit through.GOSFORD PARK - his only British-made film - works because of a tip-top script by the English actor Julian Fellows and a waterproof cast of British thesps. It won the 2001 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and the BAFTA for Best British Film, and it's about all of those things that often fill films about England's past: class, period costumes and country houses. In fact, at times it feels like a retread of Alan Bridges' little-seen 1985 costume drama THE SHOOTING PARTY in which the English upper classes congregate in a stately home for a bit of symbolic pheasant shooting on the eve of the Great War. Gosford Park isn't a real house - the film was shot at three different stately homes in the south of England and at Shepperton Studios in London.Fellows script nicely observes what a country house weekend in November 1932 must have been like: the way servants are referred to by their employers' names, for instance. The tremendous cast of Equity's finest has upstairs Michael Gambon, Kristen Scott Thomas. Maggie Smith, James Wilby, Charles Dance and Jeremy Northam (as Ivor Novello), and below stairs there's Helen Mirren, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Clive Owen, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi, Emily Mortimer and Kelly McDonald. I'm sure had she not been playing Iris Murdoch at the time, a role would have been found for Judi Dench. And when the Lord of the Manor Michael Gambon is bumped off two thirds of the way through, up turns a pipe-smoking and raincoat wearing police inspector, played for comic effect by Stephen Fry. The film is loosely structured and full of fractured dialogue and half-observed and half-resolved sub-plots. There's also a couple of Americans who feel surplus to requirements, including Ryan Phillipe as a Hollywood actor posing as a Scottish valet, Henry. It has one or two lovely little moments, such as the staff standing in a doorway listening to Ivor Novello play and sing on the piano; or Kelly MacDonald's Ladysmaid, who stays up all night to wash her Ladyship's blouse, only for her Ladyship (Smith) decide the next morning she's not going to wear it. Watch closely a gem of a scene when Richard E Grant as a butler 'accidentally' drops hot coffee into the unpleasant Henry's lap - the giggling and smirking delight on the various guests' faces is a joy to behold. Sir William ends up having been killed by his illegitimate son (Owen) and his housekeeper (Mirren), whom years ago he had gotten pregnant when she worked in one of his factories - as he did with many of his employees.

170,Rick-34,brilliant ensemble murder comedy,10,14 November 2003,"Gosford Park is a delicious example of what can be accomplished in film when you assemble an excellent cast, a fine script, and a strong director lets the actors take the film and run with it.  As is typical with Altman films, one has to really pay attention or risk missing a crucial detail.  Altman himself says that he hopes people see this film at least twice.  For the first viewing, the film will be experienced as a typical whodunit in the Christie style.  But instead of a brilliant detective figuring out the mystery, the police detective is a buffoon, and only a servant puzzles things out.  But the film is truly enjoyed with the second viewing.  Gosford park is more a comedy about the British class system than a whodunit.  And the acting is superb:  there are easily half a dozen actors who could have stolen the film, including Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Mary McDonell, Maggie Smith and others.  And then one sees an actor of the caliber of Derek Jacobi playing a minor valet!  All the details are perfect.  I was inspired to write this review partly because the review featured at IMDB complained about ""fake accents"".  The only fake accent in the film is Ryan Phillipe's, whose character is an American faking a Scottish accent. The English characters are played by English actors, and the Scottish maid speaks with the same Scottish accent in real life (she is one of many actors who is included in the features in the DVD - I highly recommend the DVD for anybody who missed this in the cinema.)In summary, a delight and a true Altman masterpiece.",Gosford Park
171,taikman,A sophisticated and classy murder-mystery.,8,28 April 2002,"Gosford Park is a British murder mystery set in a country mansion where the class divisions between servants and masters are not as stark as they seem. The people who gather at the McCordle family mansion for a weekend's shooting include an appallingly snobby Countess (the delightful Maggie Smith), grumpy host Sir William, an Jewish-American director, a British celebrity, various upper-class gentry and the horde of servants that includes Mary Macrechan, a young maid through whose eyes we mainly see events unfold. Almost all have secrets. Many have motivations for murder.There over 30 speaking parts, a bewildering number of different plotlines and initially it is hard to remember who is who, which lord married which lady for the money, who is blackmailing whose daughter and exactly how many affairs are going on. Though I still rate Memento's brilliantly crafted screenplay as the year's best, the beauty of Gosford Park's Oscar-winning screenplay is how it makes nearly everyone clearly fit in to the scheme of things eventually and that it gives even characters with tiny parts depth. Director Robert Altman is famous for films with large casts and his skill in handling them is on show here, as he brings out fine performances from everyone, though Steven Fry's bumbling inspector seems out of place.The film does a fine job of skewering upper-class hypocrisy and arrogance, but also has a lot of compassion and wit, and a very good resolution. However it is only during the final scenes of that resolution that I really felt moved emotionally: Gosford Park is a movie to admire rather than love.RATING: 8/10",Gosford Park
172,OutsideHollywoodLand,A Disappointing Effort,3,2 February 2010,"Altman meets Agatha Christie, with some pretty confusing results. Agatha Christie's mysteries were a finely honed balance between character development and plot detail—knowing just enough to care about discovering who the killer was and why he/she killed. Unfortunately, Altman cares about neither aspect of story development here. There was a time when the mention of an Altman film gave me shivers of anticipation and excitement. Altman had crafted the ensemble cast concept into a visual delight - M*A*S*H and Nashville spring instantly to mind. But, like the saying goes, all good things must come to an end and Gosford Park is definitely the end of Altman's creative spark. Altman proved that an ensemble cast of 15 people could be a rare confection indeed. Under his skillful control he was always aware of how a good plot and subtle character nuances could bring out the best in his characters—and hence the story. Yet, like the greedy child in a candy store, Altman attempts to ""go extreme"" and serve up a mishmash ensemble cast that topples over at 30! Among the jumble of corridor scenes, kitchen scenes, and bedroom confessions are a few bright spots—Maggie Smith as a tired aristocrat with attitude, the too-inquisitive maid, and the bumbling, self-assured detective who hasn't a clue---for a change! Another extreme was the pacing of the plot. Was it necessary to keep the pace at fast forward? A smaller cast and slower pace would have done much to save this lovely-looking film from pretentious posing.",Gosford Park
173,mar9,Patience rewarded,8,21 May 2002,"This is a film that probably needs to be seen more than once. It is a great, measured, complex Persian carpet of a film, with a huge cast and an initially bewildering array of characters. If the viewer does not pay attention, it would be easy to be dismissive about it, because although it is a long film at over two hours, by contemporary standards not much seems to happen. The film's value is in the authentic performances of the entire cast and the interactions between them.Watch out particularly for Richard E. Grant's gleefully sadistic footman, Stephen Fry as the police inspector and Kelly Macdonald's subtle performance as Mary. But really, everybody is good in this, not a bad performance in the ensemble.",Gosford Park
174,jaesboxer,A delightful Altman triumph,8,27 May 2002,"After turning out such mediocre movies as Cookie's Fortune and Dr. T And The Women, Robert Altman makes an outstanding comeback with Gosford Park, a Upstairs-Downstairs style murder-mystery so full of drama, droll wit, unique characters and hidden truths that under a lesser director it could have simply crashed under it's own weight.  As it is however, Gosford Park is a memorable motion picture experience, which retains a certain level of nostalgic wit, even when plunging into the sometimes dark depths of it's multiple characters.  Perhaps, in time, this will even be a film to rival Altman's masterpiece MASH. By employing such excellent veteran actors, such as Maggie Smith, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Mirren (just to name a few) and combining them with lesser known talents, Altman gives us a wry, heartfelt objective portrait of the class struggles in England, while sympathising with all involved.  Standout performances, particularly Maggie Smith, who doubtlessly generates the vast majority of the laughs, are complementary to the superb script by Oscar winner Julie Fellowes.  The mystery is lurid, yet at all times we feel the characters hidden pasts, some of which are revealed to us, some of which are not.  All in all, Gosford Park is a delightful Altman triumph, that harkens back unapologetically to the heyday of classic mysteries such as the Thin Man.",Gosford Park
175,Dadge,A mumbling masterpiece,9,24 January 2004,"A fabulous film. Great acting, good story, brilliant design. Not normally the kind of film I'd go and see, but it was so good I couldn't help but be drawn in to its world. Surely the best-ever cinematic depiction of the upstairs-downstairs lives of an English country house.The only problem with it, and this was picked up on by several friends who saw it, was that it was often difficult to hear what the characters were saying. I don't know whether this was the fault of the sound guy on set, or the sound guy in post-production, or the tape makers, or the cinemas, but I do know it spoilt the film for a lot of people.",Gosford Park
176,The Movie Buff,Why?...............,7,19 April 2002,"As in why did altman take a good plot and acting and destroy the movie.  Why did we have to get avalanched with characters in the first 20 minutes of the movie.  It basically ruined the whole movie for me, even though I understood the end.  Instead of just watching and enjoying the movie, I had to struggle through the whole movie to find out which character was which.      Its not even like Altman had a good reason to bombarde us with characters.  They werent even that important for the plot.  What made it even worse was that all of the characters look similiar, and he doesnt develop them enough for the viewer to go, ""Ok I remember that guy from when he did"", all he does is introduce the characters in casual conversation, and then moves on to others.        Like I said the plot was good, especially the ending and the acting is also very good, but i would advise to wait for it to come out on tape, this way you can rewind and rewind when your hit with the meaningless avalanche in the beginning.",Gosford Park
177,richievee,Brilliantly Conceived and Executed,10,21 September 2011,"Either you embrace this sort of film or abhor it. I fall into the former category. ""Gosford Park"" is a slow-paced but wryly perceptive examination of British classes in the early 1930s. Think of it as ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" as viewed through a microscope. The huge cast is difficult to identify upon first encounter, just because of the sheer number of worthy characters who share screen time. So effective is the acting that each of the personae seems to have a back history. This may cause momentary confusion, as you wonder why he or she is behaving in such an inexplicable manner. But it also fleshes them out and makes them appear to be real human beings, rather than conduits of stereotypical posturing. The story line is convoluted in the extreme, perfect for such a ""murder mystery."" I put that in quotes because homicide is only an excuse for screenwriter Julian Fellowes, director Robert Altman, and a brilliant contingent of actors to provide some of the most captivating dialogue and characterization that you are likely to see in any film anywhere. (Personally, I fell in love with Kelly Macdonald.) By all means, invest your money in ""Gosford Park."" You will not be disappointed, unless of course mindless action is your thing. And the bonus material alone is worth the price.",Gosford Park
178,ignatiusloyala,You'll like it if you love films like Magnolia and Traffic,10,10 May 2002,"I've read through the first page of comments made by the many users, and I think I can understand why many think this film is overrated. People think that this film sucks because they don't like multi-story plot and they find it difficult to follow the stories. Some may expect a spine-chilling murder and want to be scared and wet the seat. However, those who really appreciate and understand the movie know more than clear that the film itself focuses on the life of the upper-class people (and the life of the time) rather than a bloody crime. The movie defines the word originality no better. In fact, Julian Fellowes deserves all the awards he received since the screenplay is challenging to write and it's difficult to pack all the stories in a 150-minute movie. He explains the complicated relationship between the visitors so well, and he virtually creates a motive for murdering Sir William for everyone so that the crime itself becomes very mystifying. Of course, I must admit that there are really too many characters and it's simply impossible to keep track of everyone's movement in the first half of the movie; but Julian leaves the necessary hints for our understanding that our feeling intensifies more and more as the story unfolds. Even better is the dialogue - sharp, sarcastic, amusing, clever. It confers life to the film and fully delineates the character of the many visitors however short the time is when they appear on the screen. Before I saw it, I had always asked why Memento did not win an Oscar. But the time when the film ended, I was left stunned on my seat. I mean both stories are great and original, but when comparing the relative difficulty in writing the screenplay, Gosford Park apparently wins.Gosford Park is to me perhaps the second best movie I've seen this year (after A Beautiful Mind). If you like films like Magnolia and Traffic, which require much patience to enjoy, it's perhaps the greatest movie of your lifetime.",Gosford Park
179,paloma54,Brilliant Cast in Unfocused Story Ultimately Unsatisfying,3,16 April 2013,"I know there are many fans of Robert Altman out there, mystifying though that is to me. I did somewhat enjoy Nashville, BUT, his particular style does not leave sufficient time or space on film to develop the characters in any depth, nor do we see any real growth.I had a similar reaction to this film, but found Gosford Park even less satisfying, thanks to the very high hopes I had based on the writing of Julian Fellowes, which has been so magnificent in Downton Abbey, and on the sheer number of extremely talented actors/actresses in the cast. Sadly, all of this talent is wasted in this film. Mr. Altman seems not to have sufficient regard for his audience to feel that it is necessary to actually tell a story.The result for me is a film which doesn't know what it wants to accomplish - will this be a rich, rewarding drama of lives affording us the opportunity to care about intriguing characters, or will this be a brain-teasing British mystery? Sadly, as a mystery it is an epic failure, since the murder in the story and its solution seem not to interest the filmmaker at all and none of it is really resolved. As a British drama, it also fails miserably, in that we don't really get much of the interactions of the characters to learn enough about them to be interested or to care what they do.In fact, I will be forced to muddle through this film a second time (should I even waste my time?) merely to see which character goes with which name. There is no excuse for this sort of sloppiness, regardless of whether that is Robert Altman's personal style or not. Perhaps he just is an incompetent director? I would love to see this film remade with the same cast including an extra 30 minutes of screenplay written by good old J. Fellowes. As it now stands, it doesn't quite add up to a whole story.",Gosford Park
180,DaveZ,a study of class structure,9,13 January 2002,"Perhaps I was sitting in a bad seat and couldn't hear the speakers well. Maybe I was just not paying close enough attention.  Maybe director Altman was careless. I had one heck of a time keeping the characters and their relationships to one another straight in this movie.  Of the `upstairs folk,' who was married to whom, and who hated who why?  Of the `servant class', who was a maid and who was a cook, or a valet or a butler?  And which downstairs person `reported to' which upstairs person?Or maybe that was the point.Ultimately, I was much more interested in the class structure gathered in this house than I was about the specific history between characters, or even the murder of the lord of the manor.  Of course, most of the characters didn't seem too concerned about the murder either, or rather, the SOLVING of the crime.  You get the idea that while names and faces may change, this society will continue (or at least the characters THINK it will).",Gosford Park
181,MotoMike,A fitting bookend to M*A*S*H,9,1 November 2002,"I can understand why many people might not like it at all: it's a bit obscure, hard to follow, and the plot is as foggy as it is in many other Altman movies. That having been said, I loved this film, and think it's one of the best Altman films. It's interesting that a murder mystery set in a British country house shares a lot with one of Altman's first movies, M*A*S*H, set in Korea in a different time: all the comments above also apply to the early movie as well. In Gosford Park, it becomes clear that the plot's not the thing; if anything, it's a bit of a distraction. A group of relatives and friends - well, acquaintances, at any rate - gather in a for a weekend of shooting and socializing; somebody ends up dead, we find out whodunnit, everyone leaves. How common is that? But the point isn't the murder; it's, among other things, the tensions created by the class/caste system at that time, the hostility masked by the manners exhibited by the upper classes, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) insults and barbs thrown around, and (it seems to me) the constant tension created by an environment of huge disparities of income. Kind of like Dallas on any Sunday.Visually, the film is a complete treat; the cinematography is superb. Sonically, non-Altman fans (and myself) will complain that much of the dialogue is obscured and fragmented. This is completely deliberate; I got the DVD and turned on the subtitles and got quite a bit more out of the third viewing. But - and this is what makes both this (and M*A*S*H, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller) really a masterpiece - even though you don't get every word, suddenly you realize that you know exactly what's going on. Altman's ability to get this across to the audience in spite of the difficulty of understanding the details is what makes him a master.Finally, the one thing I really disliked about this movie is that, in the end, you realize that these people, all of them, really don't care for each other at all. Some of them hate each other, others just don't care for each other, but there's so little, or none, real affection shown in the movie that it's a bit absurd and mannered.High points: every moment on screen with Helen Mirren in it. She just crackles. Recall that she and Michael Gambon were also in ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover"", with him playing a younger and louder version of the same role. Every moment that Jeremy Irons is singing, indeed, every moment he's onscreen. And of course, Maggie Smith, who just licks up her part like a purring, nasty, housecat lapping up cream; she steals every scene she's in and you know she knows it. Her comments to Ivor Novello (Jeremy Irons): ""What is it like, you know, when a movie just kind of flops? It must be so difficult"" so venomous, and delivered with such faux sympathy - defines her to at T.
As I said, not everyone's poisoned cup of tea.",Gosford Park
182,pc_dean,Screaming Blue-Bloody Murder,10,17 February 2002,"Among the many life lessons I've learned at the movies, high on the list is this: If you value your life, never spend the weekend at a British country manor.  Those places kill more people than Dodge City on a hot day.Just such an ill-fated overnighter fills in the story around ""Gosford Park"", Robert Altman's sharp, insightful examination of the class system and social mores of pre-war Britain.  An aging gent (Michael Gambon), who, unlike much of the peerage then and since, actually has the money to go with his title, hosts a pheasant-shooting party at his giant country estate.  Invited are various relatives, friends, enemies, hangers-on, and schemers.  There is, of course, a murder, and no shortage of nasty motives and dirty secrets that show a seamy side behind the proper setting.  The murder mystery is the engine that drives the plot, but there are numerous stories going on at once, which Altman skillfully weaves in.Mostly, the movie is a portrait of the upstairs/downstairs culture of Britain: the numerous servants, cooks, valets, etc., and how they interact with those they serve (how many movies credit a Technical Advisor for ""Butler""?).  We see the ways in which the class structure can be breached, and the ways in which it can't.  This phenomenon extends to other parts of society as well: we see a police inspector (wonderfully pompous Stephen Fry) who snaps at his John-Bull constable for fretting about forensic preservation while his boss is trying to glad-hand the toffs.Surprisingly for movies of this type, ""Gosford Park"" never descends into full-throated preaching on the subject.  The points it makes are subtle, and while some of them are devastating, the movie itself does not seem to make judgements about what it shows us; that it leaves to us.  In fact, one of the striking things we learn is the way the caste system was enforced just as rigidly from the bottom as it was from the top.Much has been made about Altman's looting of top-drawer British talent for this movie, and it is all deserved: there is not a bad performance in the bunch.  Especially noteworthy are Maggie Smith, as the cattiest grande dame you ever met, Emily Watson as a knowing maid, coolly unflappable Clive Owen as a secretive valet, and Kelly MacDonald as the main protagonist, a shy Scots maid whose innocence masks a sharp mind.  Even the token Yanks, Bob Balaban (who receives ""idea"" credit) and Ryan Phillippe, manage to hold their own, with Balaban especially funny as a high-stress Hollywood producer of, of all things, Charlie Chan movies.Altman juggles all this particularly well, as he tends to do with such movies, neither spending too much time on a particular sub-story or neglecting it.  His photography also does a good job contrasting the lush, fancy dining rooms with the darker basement corridors of the servants.  He throws us enough of the conventions of the drawing-room mystery to keep us entertained, but doesn't overplay it.  We see a lot of playful zooms on various bottles labelled ""Poison"", but there is no Miss Marple gathering everyone together and pointing out that only Lord Bustle-Thwaite could possibly have known about the secret passage into the smoking-lounge, etc.The script by Julian Fellowes is crisp, witty, and consistently involving, even over two and a half hours (it's a rare mystery that takes such time getting to the actual murder).  It is packed with small, revealing moments: a butler grabs a quick smoke, two maids dance in a dining hall to the music coming from the drawing room, a man of rank slips into a basement pantry to eat strawberry jam with a spoon.  The solution to the mystery is a bit on the obvious side, but still affecting.If there is a fault to the movie, it is that it is difficult to keep everyone straight and figure out who is saying what to whom about whom else. All the characters (and there are a lot of them, dames and ladies and earls and whatnot) are introduced in a whirlwind right at the beginning; just to complicate matters, the servants are called alternately by their own names and their bosses', and everyone is also involved in their own little intrigues and storylines (this difficulty might just be me: I had no trouble tracking the various grunts, snake-eaters, and mech jockeys of ""Black Hawk Down"", but throw a couple of viscounts at me and I'm toast.)  A second viewing would probably clear a lot of that up; still, you might bring a notebook.""Gosford Park"" is a rare great thing: a deep but unpretentious script, attacked by a skilled director and a stellar cast, rounded out by beautiful art direction, photography, and music.  It's a chance for those of us who lack the proper breedin' to see a culture that is largely but not entirely gone.  Still, if you ever find yourself at a rustic English manse, remember these tips:  wear Kevlar under your evening wear, eat only out of cans, and keep an eye on that butler.  He looks kinda shifty.",Gosford Park
183,Bob A-2,"Decent as literature, but needs a lot more work as drama",6,18 February 2002,"Gosford Park was a bit lifeless for me. Attempt was to combine Shooting Party with an Upstairs, Downstairs situation, plus a few others (Cold Comfort Farm, Agatha Christie's you-name-it) thrown in for self-parody's sake. The intent I assume was contrast, but the result is a grayish blur -- visually as well as figuratively. Same problem I had with Black Hawk Down (or Watership Down, with its cast of lookalike British bunnies for that matter): so many characters I couldn't keep track. G Park is a more quality piece of writing than I make it sound, but the intent was apparently to have conflict develop gradually until it busts loose near end, and by then I don't care much -- shortening the running time 15 or 20 minutes would have kept me a little more interested, and not at the expense of anything important. Characters are consistently disagreeable anyway. Sameness is not a preferred goal when the project is potentially hackneyed from its very conception, no matter how loudly the credit for this idea is touted by Messrs Altman and Balaban. That sameness is not just between this film and the ones it's imitating, but within the film's own structure from beginning to end.I did not absolutely hate Gosford Park. It may in fact grow on people after a second viewing, when it hits Bravo on basic cable or when the video can be rented for a few bucks, and one's investment in the expectation involved in ""going to the movies"" is no longer a factor.",Gosford Park
184,odor007,DISAPPOINTING...OSCARS??!!!!?!?!??,5,18 February 2002,"Well I must say this was a disappointing film, especially considering it was by Robert Altman, one of the great American directors.  This film was long, tedious, dull, and slow, and I was struggling to hold still in my seat I was so anxious for the film to end.  For me, the only thing that made me pay any attention was Maggie Smith who played a hilarious British rich snob, and her lines in the film were great.  Yet other than that, although it was a great cast, this film, uh.... why don't we say SUCKED.  It was amazingly hard to follow, the lighting of the house that the film took place in gave me a headache, and although the ending was good, I found that I couldn't care less what happened.  Altman uses an hour and a half to build up the characters, but he has so many characters in the film that there is absolutely no character development--the audience is too confused and bored to care about breaks in the story.  In the previews to the film, we find out that the film is about a group of rich guests going to a British country home for a hunting party, and one of them is murdered.  But by the end of the film, we don't even clearly discover who the actual murderer was, and I had no clue who did it, and didn't really care, until someone told me.  On top of all that, because almost of the characters were either Scottish or British, I found it difficult to understand.  I would almost like this film more if it weren't being nominated for an Oscar, especially best picture, because a film like David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" deserves an Oscar much more than ""Gosford Park.""  I do think that Altman did a great job creating a really closed- in and claustrophobic feeling within the house, and every scene that was shot outside made me feel relieved and free from the madness of the characters within the house-yet this was Altman's genius, and for me one of the only highlights of the movie.",Gosford Park
185,FilmSchoolWriter,The best (and most complex) whodunit I've ever come across,10,11 June 2006,"I have to give Robert Altman a standing ovation. Gosford Park is spectacular. It's an amazingly complex whodunit that will leave you guessing until the very, very end.The entire cast is amazing. No one ever drops character and each character serves a purpose - which is no small feat with such a colossal ensemble. The cinematography is jaw dropping. You will notice that the camera never stops moving, which helps to keep the movie going at such a quick pace. I cannot even imagine writing the script for this movie, it is a feat well worth the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.In my past experiences with whodunits, I've noticed two types. In the first type, the murderer is obvious and the motives are even more obvious. In the second type, the murderer is not obvious because we aren't given enough clues or something like it. But Gosford Park does the fabulous job of falling into neither category. In Gosford Park, we are given every clue, every motive, and it is still not until the end that we figure out what all those clues come together to mean.Gosford Park is a truly excellent film and unlike any that I have ever seen.

Even a hearing impaired American can enjoy much of the irony.  The acting is as good as any that Merchant-Ivory have evoked, but with cutting edges that they and Henry James never achieved (or dared?). My one caveat applies as well to another fine film, ""Michael Collins"".  In my experience, the word f**k and its declensions was an extremely rare expletive before 1960 or so.  Its use in these films is a little like the wrist watch on the Roman Centurion.  Is it possible that a film cannot receive a desirable R-rating without frequent use of it?

191,Jon Kolenchak,Too Much of Everything,4,20 January 2002,"Gosford Park is a film that is meticulously set, and cast with excellent actors - too many actors.  In the opening quarter hour or so of this film, I had a terrible time trying to understand the dialogue, and so when this seeming ""cast of thousands"" was all in place, I had no idea who any of these people were.  Visually, the film is just about perfect.  From every other standpoint, it falls flat.  I love Helen Mirren and Alan Bates.  It's a shame that they did not have more to do.  I also enjoy Maggie Smith, but I am getting so tired of her playing the witty ""old bitch"".  The pacing of the film is abysmally slow, but I expect that to some degree in period films. The odd thing about this film was that it was not enough for director Robert Altman to have accurate set and art direction, he also had to impress upon you the fact that you were looking at excellent period detail with camera work that was self-indulgent, to say the least.By the time the film was over, I could have cared less about who did what to whom.

192,Nahret,Another masterpiece from the master of multiple layers.,9,28 April 2002,"With trademark meandering storytelling and attention to minute detail, Robert Altman presents us his latest oeuvre. We are in the English countryside, it is the year 1932, and guests are invited to join a hunting party. A very English pastime, at which the host is completely inept, half the guest are no better than him and the rest finds it either boring or distasteful. For the first two hours, thus, we are treated to the most intriguing social study, since we are given the gift of multiple characters of astonishing substance (considering that other directors cannot even develop their leads beyond the one-dimensional) and a double view from both the gentry upstairs, and (mostly, and more insightfully) the servants, downstairs. And just when we are content to enjoy no more than said social study, the simmering tensions quite unexpectedly do come to a head. It is then that we finally get the murder we remember from the trailer, at which point the film gains astonishing momentum. Not only do we learn how mid-20th Century rural Police work (or not), but all remaining story threads are resolved to perfection. This includes hints to stories that are just about to begin - which proves that the best kind of movie does not end with the credits, but continues in the minds of the audience. Stories are about people, you see.",Gosford Park

I've seen it four times now, and there are still relationships and little things I'm unclear about.  It took me two viewings to figure out whodunit.  Still, it's downright enchanting.  It plays up the period really well with costumes and scenery and attitudes.  This picture made me fall in love with the acting talents of Maggie Smith, who was the comic relief in a rather grim film. The rest of the cast, some of the finest British actors of today, are wonderful as well, though I could have done without so much of Ryan Phillipe.  It was well-written in addition to being well-acted, and the fact that I keep watching it to try to unravel it's unending layers tells me that it's well worth my time.",Gosford Park

196,lists-9,Tedious and uninvolving,3,1 January 2007,"I have to agree with the (minority of) people who didn't like this film. Despite the star-studded cast and some excellent performances, the film seemed at least half an hour too long. There seemed to be no real atmosphere created, certainly no tension or feeling of threat, and even the humour was confined to the occasional titter rather than anything outstandingly clever or funny. For me, the major problem was that I couldn't make myself care about any of the characters - even the murder victim. Director Robert Altman has to take the blame for this, in making many of them witty and amusing, but none of them sympathetic. Social comment, perhaps, but I would say there's more human interest in five minutes worth of the Upstairs, Downstairs TV series than in this whole, long film.The sound, too, seemed to be badly recorded. Despite turning up the volume on the DVD loud, there were many sections where I was straining to hear what the characters were muttering. Overall, a waste of time.",Gosford Park

The interesting thing about this film is that the murderer's discovery slips away almost unnoticed while the whole film is actually a vivid fresco of the English noble society of the time. This is possible also because the crime takes place practically at the end when the characters have been outlined and the atmosphere has been created thanks to their passions, dramas vicissitudes. Do not miss the final twist but, I repeat, the picture is precious and not the individual details. It is always a pleasure to see talents led by a master.",Gosford Park

The recreation of a time and lifestyle and the occassional witty banter can't overcome the fact that there are so many characters you don't know who the hell anybody is and you don't really care.  It's not a mystery, it's not a comedy, not dramatic.  Just another self indulgent exercise by an ""actor's director"".  Gimme some plot, some humor, something...",Gosford Park
199,doodah367,"Interesting study, told with interweaving storylines and complicated relationships",7,17 March 2002,"Gosford Park is clearly the work of a genius.  Altman has taken particular care to detail, accurately recreating a country house party of the 1930's. However, what the director is obviously much more interested in is the inner workings of the house, how the relationships between the characters differ between appearance and reality.  The film is slightly deceiving in advertising itself as a murder mystery, as the main theme of the film is not murder or detective work, yet the different between the social classes, the 'upstairs' and the 'downstairs' party.  The films closing credits epitomise this by dividing the cast list into two, in the same way the characters would have been divided in their contemporary period.  The extent of Altman's genius is shown in his ability to interweave so many different storylines and relationships between the characters.  He has assembled an eclectic list of characters, each with their own quirks and personal interests, and then throws them 'Big Brother style' into a house, observing how they interact like a scientist testing rats.  The representation of the characters is also extremely clever, as the film doesn't generalise the upper classes in a derogatory role whilst presenting the lower classes in a more general light.  Instead, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, making themselves completely individual to the rest of the house.This, however, is one of the films pitfalls as by the end of the film, the audience may not have figured out every character and may have made their own conclusions, which do not concur with the directors intention.  However, this remains to be a wholly fascinating study of class differences, and character relationships, in the 1930's.",Gosford Park
200,livingyourpassion,A Copy of Rules of the Game,7,19 June 2002,"While this film was well made and well acted, I find it to be way over-rated. This movie is a mere copy of Renoir's classic Rules of the Game. If you are interested in seeing Gosford Park, you should check out Rules of the Game first. I don't see how the critics liked the film so much. Don't get me started on the Academy Awards. Best Script? Please, that is an insult to Christopher Nolan's brilliant masterpiece in Memento. Maggie Smith is a good actress, but she gets typecast, playing the same roles well in many of her films. Robert Altman is a good director, but this film doesn't really show that. While mildly entertaining, the film is slow paced, and some may find it downright boring.

201,RHKLWK,"Uh, Seriously Folks",5,4 July 2002,"Please, drop what you are doing, and borrow, buy, or rent Alan Bridges' brilliant film, ""The Shooting Party"" (1985).  (If you can't find it, look for it on the Bravo channel.)  Then, compare/contrast that film to/with Altman's movie.Uh, seriously folks, ever since ""Nashville"" (1975), Altman has been coasting.  If someone had just told him then, that, for the sake of the listening audience (except for those watching at home with the benefit of subtitles), it helps if the actors take turns talking--one at a time--perhaps we would have been spared more than a quarter-century of auditory confusion, to say nothing of having to turn the volume all the way up to distinguish the half-dozen English/American/Scottish dialects that assault you from every direction, and in competition with background noise, as you must in this movie.  Really, what was originally a clever convention is now an annoying and unnecessary contrivance.And then there is the small matter of the story.  ""Nashville"" convinced Altman that he could film a succession of scenes, most of them disconnected, and he would have a story.  The next year (1976), Altman rolled out ""Buffalo Bill & the Indians,"" really one of the worst movies EVER made, and yet a few critics raved about it, evidently convincing Altman that he had found THE formula.  There is a tiny story hidden away in ""Gosford Park,"" but it does not emerge until the last twenty minutes.It's not that ""Gosford Park"" is a bad film, it isn't.  Instead, it's an ordinary film.  Nothing exceptional.  The actors?  Sure, they're talented, but they weren't challenged in this movie.  This is not Shakespeare. 
And the costumes?  They hardly make a film.  Check out Buffalo Bill's and Annie Oakley's duds in the 1976 film.I had a slight problem with the setting--1932.  It would have been better had the story been set in 1922 or, better, in 1912 (see ""The Shooting Party"").  By 1932, Britain was in the middle of the worldwide depression (it was not just an American phenomenon), and the lifestyle depicted in ""Gosford Park"" had essentially disappeared (although obviously not the class distinctions).  This is a minor nitpick.I do think Altman had trouble deciding whether he was making ""Murder by Death,"" ""Clue,"" ""Upstairs, Downstairs,"" or the extraordinary ""The Shooting Party.""  It contains elements of all four.  There wasn't a single scene in the movie that was not derivative of some other movie or television series. 
There have been so many truly excellent British productions in the last ten or 15 years, but this wasn't one of them.  It's an expensively produced melodrama that is nice to look at, but it took too long to tell, and has almost nothing else going for it.  See ""The Shooting Party.""",Gosford Park
202,yearspew,A Masterpiece.,9,21 June 2008,"I watched Gosford Park with no expectations. I knew it received some Academy Award nominations and that's about it.What started like just any other period drama turned out to be one of the best written and amazingly acted films I've seen.I love movies with characters talking. I love it when dialogue can entertain as much and more than action. Gosford Park has a lot of characters that move the story through brilliant and very entertaining dialogue.The characters, all of them, are great. No protagonist, just a bunch of characters together in one big setting. The acting was amazing from everyone. Ryan Philippe in the best performance I've seen him give, same with Kelly Macdonald. Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Clive Owen, Kristin Scott Thomas and Michael Gambon were perfect as well. And the rest of the cast whose names I don't remember right now were also great.It may sound like I'm overly simplifying by saying ""everyone was great"", but in this case it's very true. I was mesmerized by how brilliant the casting was. Especially for a movie with as many characters as this.The direction was superb. I'm not familiar with Robert Altman's work but this certainly was a very good place to start.The film has very good dramatic moments and the comedy is also spot-on. It balances beautifully between drama, intrigue and comedy and the result is a film that is a delight to watch, and re-watch.I think Gosford Park is an example of great writing, great acting, great directing and easily one of the top ten films of the 21st century.",Gosford Park
203,craigboney,a bit of a sows ear made from a silk purse...,6,11 March 2002,"With a who's who cast of fine British actors (Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Helen Mirren et al), and Robert Altman at the helm, the portents seemed good. The presence of Emily Watson was also a major factor ('Breaking The Waves' -for me, one of the saddest, most beautiful and most brilliant pieces of cinema ever).I'd heard this was maybe a little above the usual English country house period drama fodder. Indeed, the start was impressively done, as you get sucked into the world as it was in the 1930's and the way the extended family suckle at the fat belly of Sir William McCordle (played by Michael Gambon). Upon his death, it's rather stultifying to witness the calmness, almost warm wave of apathy that seems to infuse most of the gathering. Unfortunately, this lack of emotion from the characters infected me as well.It's sometimes difficult with such a large cast simply remembering who is who and how they interrelate with each other. To overcome this, it helps if there is enough depth to encourage repeat viewings. Unfortunately, it takes so long for anything beyond character development and scene setting to occur, that repeat viewings are (for me anyway) unlikely. The volume of characters and their equality in terms of importance unfortunately renders the viewer's relationship with even the most interesting ones - such as Robert Parks (Clive Owen) and Mrs Wilson, The Housekeeper (Helen Mirren) - not necessarily intimate enough to generate any real feeling when their denouement comes.The absolute nadir of the movie is the atrocious Inspector Thompson (portrayed by Stephen Fry), such a ridiculous unbelievable caricature of an incompetent 1930's Detective that by his appearance he sucks out all seriousness and believability from the final third of the story. Handling unfingerprinted decanters? Ignoring clues found by enterprising Constables? You betcha. Thankfully the good points - the performances of Emily Watson, Maggie Smith and Richard E Grant, the articulation of the class differences and arrogance of the upper-classes - balance this somewhat. Unfortunately, for me, this was still a bit of a sows ear made from a silk purse.",Gosford Park

You are also bombarded with a myriad of names (characters), all of them addressing each other in a constant bla-bla-bla so that you don't know who is who until very late in the film.

Well, at least I wasn't dumb enough to watch all of it. I turned it off at the one hour point. I can't comment on the last 1 hour and 18 minutes; but I will say this much: the first hour is the most boring and pointless hour of movie I've seen since Pearl Harbor. I was just sitting there, ready to yell at the screen: ""Look, if you're going to have a murder, have a murder already"". It was kind of obvious when they show you a jar with ""poison"" written on it, that yeah, someone's gonna die. Also it has this problem of having way to many characters. For example they had two tables of characters (one table had the guest, the other had the servants).Now I don't mind movies that are talky; but if the people are gonna say something; say something interesting. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was good at it, yes it was very talky; but the dialog was well written and I could relate to the characters. Basically, it needs more editing; cut down the running length so that I won't have to sit there for an hour waiting for stuff to happen.

The energy seemed to have flagged before the resolution to the mystery.Of course Maggie Smith deserves special mention; she SHOULD have won the Oscar, she was wickedly delightful throughout. Stephen Fry was the exception to an otherwise outstanding cast/ensemble performance: his was the only performance that was over the top, hammy, played for broad laughs.

(With a decent interval in between, of course, I am not obsessive compulsive!) And what do you know, this is one of them. And yet my wife hates it. She says it is long, (true) rambling, (true) has no story (not true it has several.) And perhaps therein lies the issue between those who ""get it"" and those who do not. This is not an ordinary film. Most of all I see it as a film about English society in the 1930s, although I full well understand that this is not the complete story either. It perhaps is typical Altman movie. He tells his stories the way people live their lives, rambling, wandering in and out of situations and if you are lucky coming together more or less at the end. Other films touch on the same ground - Merchant Ivory's ""Remains of the Day"" most notably, and perhaps ""The Shooting Party."" But these are totally different films although set with similar characters and in a similar milieu. (How on earth is that bloody word spelled? - But I am sure you get my drift.)

210,mark_r_harris,In the Hands of a Master,10,5 December 2001,"Robert Altman is at the very top of his form in the scintillating Gosford Park, and he's working with a dream cast, all of whom, down to the bittiest bit player, have wonderful material to work with and who do it complete justice. The Altman work this has the closest affinity with is A Wedding, a strong but messy film during which you feel that a number of sub-plots and minor characters have been largely lost in the cutting room. No such problem here. The mastery of the director is everywhere evident, and the screenplay by Julian Fellowes, based on an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban, provides a rock-solid structure. Clearly there are several genres and influences in play in Gosford Park: the Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, shading ever so slightly into Clue-land; the Jean Renoir country weekend in The Rules of the Game; the classic British television series Upstairs Downstairs (this last debt is underlined by the fact that the Gosford Park cast includes Meg Wynn Owen, who played Hazel in Upstairs Downstairs, and Eileen Atkins, who co-created the series with Jean Marsh). The cinematic style is utterly fluid, and the rooms and halls of the great house (an actual noble estate) are as palpable to us as if we were guests.There are too many fine actors in Gosford Park to single out all of them, although one must mention the foxiness of Clive Owen (headed toward major stardom, believe me); the gravity of Helen Mirren; the inevitable perfection of Maggie Smith in a role that seems tailored for her; the brittle aristocracy of Kristin Scott Thomas; the severity of Charles Dance; the furtive appeal of Ryan Philippe; the solid masculine charm of Jeremy Northam (and who knew he could sing?); the skunkiness of James Wilby; the hauteur of Richard E. Grant; the moral centeredness of Kelly Macdonald; the goofy ineptitude of Stephen Fry; the seen-it-all knowingness of Emily Watson; the nasty lordliness of Michael Gambon; the cracks-in-the-facade of Alan Bates.

This is done with charming wit mixed equally with genuine passion, if understated then all the more effective. Altman's camera moves fluidly among the layers and nooks of this mansion, capturing the interplay of private moments and public scenes.

No, you CAN'T identify who's who, or who's who's servant is, or what the relationships are amongst the host family and their guests.

If I hadn't known myself, I'd have been as lost as anyone else! There's nothing here that either Ivory or Kenneth Branaugh couldn't have done a better job with, with a lot more polish to boot (no pun).That said, there are two reasons to see this movie (maybe at a cheaper, rainy-day matinee): Maggie Smith and Emily Watson. Smith is as great as she's ever been, playing the kind of character -- the slightly soiled socialite -- that no one else can. She's completely delicious. And Watson's turn as a worldly housemaid is perhaps the most fully formed character in the film: we know where she's been, we don't know where she'll end up, but there's no doubt she will survive. But once again, these talented actresses could have pulled off these performances under anyone's direction, not singularly Altman's.

I will say that looking at the comments was very gratifying, I couldn't believe the user rating was 7.6/10 but gladly most of us will talk about this film for what it really is.  
I have never been so outraged when watching the Academy Awards as this year, as two of the very best films from an extraordinary year, Memento and The Royal Tenenbaums, lost out to this worthless self-indulgent piece of garbage!  The Academy is so f**king full of itself I'm not sure I'll ever even watch the Oscars anymore.  This movie is NOT polished and NOT witty at ALL!  I would honestly like to sit down with some of these critics who rave about the movie and have them tell me exactly what they found so funny. This movie is NOT a comedy by any stretch of the imagination.  Memento literally had more laughs than this movie-3 solid ones (when Leonard says ""I'm chasing this guy...no wait, he's chasing me"", when he kicks the guy in room 9 instead of 6, and when he finds out he's being charged for 2 hotel rooms).  I watched this movie with a theater full of people and a few people only even CHUCKLED when one of the characters said ""fart"".  Oh yeah, that's really witty, why didn't Look Whose Talking Too sweep the Oscars? 
I've never seen such a case where critics seemed to love a movie because doing so made them ""refined"".  ""Oh a Robert Altman ensemble period piece, let me make out my best film of the year review right now, I can fill in the character names after I watch it!""  How were we supposed to care at all about the class conflict when there was hardly anyone in either class who wasn't despicable and/or boring?  I couldn't even keep track of any of the character's names or attributes, there were just so many of them Academy Award Winner Julian Fellowes was bombarding us with he seemed to have forgotten to make any of them memorable.  Emily Watson's was the only one that even bordered on it.  0x1,000,000 still equals 0.  Compare this to The Royal Tenenbaums, that had a much smaller ensemble of characters but they were all infinitely more compelling.  The plot, meanwhile, was worthless. It takes well over an hour for the murder to even take place, and then everything was so predictable, even the final ""twist"".  I've heard this movie compared to Agatha Christie by so many sources; well I loved And Then There Were None and Witness to the Prosecution and IMHO to mention this in the same breath as Christie IS A TRAVESTY!Given that the movie has no value as a comedy, a character study, or a murder mystery, what is it?  I guess it was a chance for Robert Altman to have his trademark ""brilliant"" overlapping dialogue with many British characters in a ""thoughtful"" (read: SLOW) movie and show what an ""artist"" he truly is.  Apparently in his case that's enough for a barrage of Top 10 lists and year end awards, as well as for Roger Ebert to be throwing a temper tantrum saying ""This guy is 74 years old and he's never won an Academy Award!""

However, this movie has two major flaws.The first is that it absolutely fails to introduce its myriad characters and invest the audience in their motivations and relationships. It does not help that there are way too many of them and that they are one-dimensional and mostly serve to provide (heavy-handed) social commentary. The characters are not well-written, which makes it even more frustrating to keep track of who's who and how they are related to each other for almost two hours.Then the central murder happens woth about thirty minutes to go. A cliched bumbling country detective shows up, serving mostly as comic relief, and leaves with no results. And then the murderer is suddenly revealed with some some significant plotholes in the last few minutes, and that's it. This is the second major flaw: the Upstairs Downstairs and Agatha Christie elements don't gel well, and the murder mystery almost seems tacked on. It almost only serves to further lay on the social commentary.I did really want to like and enjoy this movie. However, I could not. If I'm in the mood for a film with with social commentary on class divisions and life in British manors, I would much rather go to The Remains of the Day.",Gosford Park
220,CharlieB-5,Altman scores unlikely hit with great script and ensemble cast.,8,1 March 2002,"Can an American director known for his iconoclastic improvisations find success and happiness in an English period piece murder mystery?Yes, Virginia, it works.Set in the 1930's, over a shooting' weekend at an English estate, Altman's characteristic layered, overlapping dialogue creates a richly textured Upstairs/Downstairs sociology lesson coupled with an Agatha Christie Murder Mystery. Maybe it's because he's an American (as am I), but I don't think I've ever seen a more enjoyable or lucid exposition of the British class system. The look of the film is faded and decaying, mirroring the eroding class system it portrays. Juxtaposed to the muted colors are vibrant performances of the ensemble cast. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can hear all the pieces of dialog I missed. If there is one frustration I have in some Altman films, it's hearing all dialog. Make sure you see this movie in a movie house with a good sound system!As a murder mystery, Altman is sometimes heavy-handed with clues. Unlike some, I found the English Twit inspector (with his long-suffering competent assistant) funny, and at the same time, a believable product of a world where the class system and meritocracy did not see eye to eye.
This is Altman's best film in many years, and one of his best ever. It's great to see him going strong in his 70's.",Gosford Park
221,sanat,"Loses momentum: good actors, but weak story line",6,16 May 2002,"This movie has a very good cast. Most of cast comprises well known British actors, all of whom deliver good performances. However, the plot line is weak, and the promise created in the first half of the movie is not kept.
The movie's aim is confused. There are some `Upstairs Downstairs' elements, which seem a trifle unnecessary, since they are not germane to the murder story. As social comment they are gratuitous and inadequate.  The master-servant relationship is a complex one, and  Messrs. Altman and Balaban do not seem to understand it. The movie is a murder mystery, something that is not apparent for the first half of the film. When the movie does get down to it, its development and unravelling take place in a highly unsatisfactory manner. The sense of mystery is only inadequately created, as it is not very clear why anyone should have a motive. The actual motive becomes clear in the last few minutes of the film, and is something that would have been difficult to guess. In any mystery story, the teller has to play fair. He must provide sufficient information for the reader to solve the mystery himself. This Altman fails to do. Thus the suspense is created by not quite playing by the rules. There also the bumbling inspector with the competent sergeant. One wonders if this is more social comment, or merely an opportunity  that Altman thought too good to pass, given that Stephen Fry plays the inspector. Though Inspector Thompson's explanation about why milk is poured before the tea, was rather dismaying.The film cannot make up its mind. Eventually, the mystery bit takes a back seat, as does the social comment bit. Not surprisingly, with nothing driving it, the plot flails. The setting is good, and there is attention to detail, which brings out the atmosphere of a '20s-'30s English stately home quite well. I doubt however if  that much rumpy-pumpy went on between master and servant.All in all: well begun, but only half done.",Gosford Park
222,theedcarol,My head is still spinning,5,2 August 2002,"This movie gave my simple little mind too much to digest at too fast a rate of speed. There were too many characters and much of the dialogue was inaudible due to accents and poor sound (I finally turned on closed captioning about halfway through the movie. It helped a little.) I like murder mysteries but this one was incomprehensible. Of course my wife knew exactly what was going on and figured the whole thing out long before I had a clue.

The settings, the good representation of the period, the performances, all of that worthy of a good movie. The problem is that is very slow. It's like watching a painting. You may appreciate the beauty, but not the reason or the intention.  If this movie is supposed to work as a murder mystery drama, you'll become too numb to care. And in fact, the `mystery' is solved to us without no complications, so there is no real emotion or suspense in it. What really interested me (and that may be an indication that the appeal should be somewhere else than the `mystery' department) was seeing how good the relations of two worlds masters and servants- are depicted, with their differences, their contradictions, but the unavoidable need to coexist. Two opposites worlds acting together. But not enough to recommend, except, of course, if you really can appreciate a good painting.",Gosford Park
225,MetaLark,A Dagwood Sandwich,6,9 July 2002,"I found myself wondering about halfway through, ""Can the '30s British uppercrust have been quite this vacuous, stupid, and boring? Can their servants have been quite so smart, sensible, and superior to their employers? I doubt it."" I fancy the upper classes of that time were fairly erudite and educated, though of course there were some fools and freeloaders, as there were--and are--at every level of society. Nevertheless it was an absorbing and amusing movie--no plot to speak of, no denouement, more like a Dagwood sandwich--mustard on the bottom, mayonnaise on the top, slices of ham, pickles, ripe (very ripe) tomatoes, cheeses, baloney, and lettuce (as in, not enough). It was seasoned nicely with humor, irony, pathos, naughtiness, and passion.I suspect the mechanics of servicing a large house party were portrayed accurately; these scenes rang true, and were quite fascinating in fact. Some of the direction was nothing short of amazing. The shot of the lone butler holding an umbrella at the end of the opening scene--that was a small story in itself. And wasn't it brilliant how the second car just slid into view from around a curve and refocused your attention elsewhere. In fact this sort of thing kept happening throughout the film--you'd be following a line of thought, only to have it nudged away by another.Some would not care for this kind of disjointed story, but I found I could tolerate it quite well. The cinematography was excellent. The actors were well-cast and really superb. I recognized the lovely Kelly MacDonald not so much by her face as by her lyrical Scottish burr, which was so arresting in ""My Life So Far.""This could have been a great film had the social viewpoint been more balanced and realistic, but then perhaps ridiculing Western culture was the whole point--I don't know enough about the writers and director to say.I would recommend this to persons who delight in nuance and subtlety. Just don't go in expecting a whodunnit. Also, if you're an American, you'd best turn on the subtitles--the English diction is daunting.6/10",Gosford Park

It's okay, it's from Altman, but even Altman can be sense- and meaningless.I felt really *catapulted* into this movie from the beginning. For the next 50 minutes, nothing is really explained, or at least, you have to puzzle the explanations ""who is who"" and ""what are they doing there"" by yourself, from the dialogue of the characters. I felt like being projected into a ""basar""; the only way to understand was to catch up dialogue between dozens of characters for the next hour...

(Not a great day) Re-watched MASH though after seeing this and I think Altman is growing on me.I sympathise with other posters over the accents. It's difficult to pick out the dialogue as it is without knowing the lingo.Don't be put off though because this is a rich, rewarding movie that will stay fresh on many levels. It passes as a murder mystery but almost a spoof of that genre - more like MURDER BY DEATH. It's a great comedy also but most of all its a brilliant social & historical thriller.Strange how some US posters are fawning over the virtues and manners of the characters in this film. GOSFORD PARK is all about showing the rest of the world the real horrors of the class system. It's depicting a world of polite slavery on its last legs and Altman does the job of  justifying the US War of Independence with a million times more braincells than Mel Gibson's THE PATRIOT.GOSFORD PARK is not meant to be some pretentious Agatha Christie experience.

Altman follows the classic murder mystery formula: the first half gives everyone a motive then the murder then the second half is the investigation. The murder pits the upstairs elites against the downstairs help and once the body is found, we the audience suspect everyone. One clever twist: it takes 2-3 viewings before you realize you don't hear the elites speaking unless there's a maid or butler in the room (this adds an interesting perspective).

235,gianniz,"Upstairs, Downstairs on Acid",6,4 January 2002,"I was lucky enough to catch this film at the Kankakee, Illinois, World Film Festival.  Several of the grips were in the audience, along with a couple of best boys.  I took some notes:1.  There are so many characters in Gosford Park it's impossible to keep track of who they are and what they're up to.  Some are utterly superfluous, like the two guys who arrive late, by car.  I realize this may very well be a satire on British who-done-its of the 1930s, which tended to overwhelm American audiences with their excessive cast of characters.2.  The accents make listening to the dialog excruciating.  Despite bravado demos of sound systems by the likes of THX, with its pin-drop-in-the-puddle, the clear recording of human speech still needs work.3.  The film is morally abrasive and unsatisfying.  While no one regrets the murder of you know who, it bothers me that the Countess (Maggie Smith) does not go unpunished.  Her treatment of her maid, beautifully played by Mary Macreachran, is cruel, and in the year 2002 should not be tolerated without some kind of comeuppance.4.  And yet, the film is great fun to watch, partly because it satirizes the genre, film-making, and actors. There are homages to ""Rules of the Game"" (the pheasant shoot) and ""The Wizard of Oz"" (""Here, Dorothy, you take the dog."")  Watching Maggie Smith is a joy, but by now, a predictable one. I felt Eileen Atkins's performance was more deeply human.  I thought the talents of Ryan Phillippe were wasted, and his role too casually discarded. Helen Mirren, naturally, ruled.5.  The one enchanting sequence in the film is the musical entertainment by Jeremy Northam in the role of Ivor Novello.  Singing his own material at the piano, he welds almost the entire household, upstairs and downstairs, into an audience enraptured by art. Altman's camera records it all, lovingly, like a wonderful divertisement.  Strange that Altman should award the prize for enchantment not to film, but to music.",Gosford Park
236,rrb,Misfire,6,31 March 2007,"Altman's kaleidoscopic storytelling can yield a masterpiece like Nashville, or the brilliantly raucous M*A*S*H. But what in those films was inspired chaos is, in Gosford Park, just chaos. And all the King's horses and all the King's men (to say nothing of the knights, ladies and other A-list British actors who mostly comprise the sterling cast) couldn't put Gosford together again.The idea of creating one movie from several familiar English story lines no doubt seemed tasty to Altman and his collaborators Bob Balaban and Julian Fellowes. They set out to present a scathing examination of the upper class in that time-honored settinga shooting partyusing an Upstairs/Downstairs-style format, and encase it all in an Agatha Christie-esquire drawing room murder plot, with a John Cleese-y bumbling inspector thrown in for good measure. If this sounds like too much, it is. The movie is pulled in so many directions, it never gets anywhere. While some of the class satire is wickedly well done, the murder story is given perfunctory treatment. The subplots explaining why several none-too-suspicious suspects want the victim dead are so forgettable, and carelessly presented, you get the idea that Altman himself doesn't really care. The revelation of the real killer seems more an afterthought than a climax. And Stephen Fry's incongruous, idiotic investigator seems mistakenly edited in from another movie.Trying to tell too many stories at once isn't the only problem afflicting Gosford Park. It also suffers from too many characters. While the many roles in Nashville were as deftly and distinctly drawn as Hirschfeld caricatures, Gosford is confusing in its superfluity of indistinguishable minor parts.The frustrations noted are lightened by the many fine performances. Clive Owen, Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren earn top honors, with honorable mentions to Kristen Scott Thomas, Jeremy Northram, Michael Gambon, Ryan Phillippe, Emily Watkins and Richard E. Grant. Alan Bates and Derek Jacobi are also on hand to ensure that Gosford Park offers the most spectacular cast assembled since Murder on the Orient Express.All in all, not unenjoyable, but a very mixed bag.",Gosford Park

Do not discount anyone and you may be lucky guessing whodunit before the detective arrived.Also after watching it so many times, I still am confused where everything is.

The movie is not long however, it took me two days to finish watching it because I fell asleep a half-an-hour into the feature.  I wanted to give it a fair chance so I ended up finishing it the next day.This is an incredibly slow moving film.  Unlike Hollywood's bang'em up features Gosford Park is much slower paced.  However, the flaw with this film is not so much the slower pace but the actual story lines--there are too many and they are a mess trying to keep them straight.  It eventually boils down to a case of he-said-she-said.  Not pretty.  The stories were not tight and there were too many plot holes to keep track.What also takes away from the movie is the sound quality.  Somehow all the voices don't sound clear which makes it difficult to understand what is happening with the rest of the movie of which was understood.  I eventually had to turn on the captions on my DVD to follow along.On the positive side though, the movie was true to the period and vastly authentic.  The picture quality was good although there were times that some important elements of the film were hidden by poor lighting.  Nevertheless, it was good to see a true picture of ""rolling country sides"".My vote: 4/10",Gosford Park

But by the film's conclusion, I realized that Altman has created an extremely subtle & complex film filled w. lots of plot twists & turns that throw you completely off the scent.  He plays on all the cliches of the genre: the murdered aristocrat, the suspect servants & aristocrats, a beautiful old English country house to make it appear that this is just another genre film.  This couldn't be farther fr. the truth.  Altman has composed a sly, corrosive commentary on the English class system in which he completely turns the genre on its head.  The aristocrats are totally secondary characters in this film.  The entire film is carried by the servants.  They are the main characters, they drive the plot & completely dominate the denouement.

Be very careful in noting the plot developments because you may not notice the subtle references which reveal the killer at the end.

To say it's not only the best film of 2001 but it's also one of Robert Altman's best. Perfectly crafted, 'Gosford Park' plays a game on our eyes as well as our minds with the essence of 1930s England. It's Agatha Christie meets Robert Altman in a short summary. But don't just look at it as a murder mystery, because if you do, you miss out on what ""Gosford Park"" has inside it's walls: Classic pose, creative intricate plot, and a nostalgic look you won't help but love. If you were to see this as your first Altman film, good job, because this film is simply stunning and amazing. The surprise with the film is the all-out British cast, and it's do so rightfully well that you admire it. Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Richard E. Grant (Hugh's Brother), Michael Gambon, and Ryan Phillippe are just some of the many cast of the film. The large group may seem like too much for a murder mystery to contain while keeping the flow nice and tight, but that's the joy of the film: it fits naturally, with nothing rushed or overacted. You enter the film knowing nobody, and leave knowing everyone and their dark little secrets. While everyone gets their fare share in the film, the one who steals the show is Maggie Smith as Lady Constance Threntham, an old, wise cracking woman who's out to get her respectable allowance from Sir William McCordle (Another stunning performance from Michael Gambon).

The British countryside is well showed as it really is; i.e. green, empty and wet. In another word: miserable. Hopefully most of the movie is set within a large manor with all the characters staying warm by sitting next to the fire place. Indeed, don't expect car chase nor fancy action scenes. It is more a movie of the mind rather than of the 'streets'. It may not be attractive to the average British spectator - unless this one is over 50 or has passed the age to vandalise whatever is nearest to his seat (which nowadays may bring him around 50 anyway). Indeed, this very old-fashioned British style movie is set in a time when the UK had still some colonies, at a time when British were hypocrites and had lot of pride. Unfortunately, it does not reflect today's situation except in the hypocrisy and pride. Maybe it is nice to have this movie and to remind British spectators that they live in a small country that has no colony left and that is not an empire anymore. Welcome back to earth ! This small thing out of the way the movie is watchable and almost enjoyable. With characters each having a secret to hide, and each secret being revealed up to the last minute. Definitely a must see for a nice evening.",Gosford Park

250,ivorybigsis,Near perfect panoramic study of a Society where almost everyone has an agenda,9,10 February 2010,"I am ashamed to admit that this is my first experience with the direction of Robert Altman. I was not disappointed here. I do believe however, that had this story focused on a bunch of American Anglo-Saxons of similar social standing, it may not have fared as well. English Actors often have a depth of training sorely lacking here. I see them less about maintaining Star status as they are about rolling up their sleeves and getting the canvas painted so that the story can be told. Although we know that the casting involved a Who's Who of British Stage and Film, all the assorted aristocratic characterizations (as well as the portrayals of the seemingly invisible staff that facilitate that gentility) are dead-on.... This film is a must see, and I am struck by the realism here. Altman has accurately conveyed the claustrophobia and dearth of genuine affection in this very ordered world of people for whom jockeying for position and maintaining that position is everything. Although food is plentiful in the Society of those ""above stairs"", when it comes to authentic love, there isn't a morsel to be shared",Gosford Park

When i look at the films that were nominated for best picture(the watchable A Beautiful Mind, the Jaw Dropping Moulin Rouge, and my personal favorite Lord of the Rings; I have yet to see in the bedroom) i quite frankly expected the same caliber of film from Gosford Park. This movie does absolutely nothing for the first hour and a half. It is character development. For an hour and a half. I have never seen anything so slow or uninteresting. The key to any story is conflict. In this case, i feel conflict was given up in favor of amusing english banter. It is NOT an hilarious send up of British upper class. It is NOT a twisted murder mystery that keeps you guessing.It is an excuse for Robert Altman to get out of the house. Plain and simple. By the time anything closely resembling a conflict happens, I was so completely inundated by their dry english wit that i stopped caring. I don't think it was possible for me to care less about any of the characters on screen. When the plot starts to thicken around the dinner table as angers start to flare at the would be murder victim, i just stopped caring. I didn't care when he died. I didn't care when the inspector came. I didn't care when the maid started snooping. I didn't care when ""shocking revelations"" were made clear. Ultimately, i didn't care when i found out who the murderer was. I just didn't care. Oh God, i don't care. don't care. don't care. for the love of god, i can't stress to you the level of my ""not caring."" There were no, NO, impressive actors, Robert Altman is a ninny, the script was so bland i wouldn't eat it with tabasco sauce, the ending went like this: ""okay we are bored, we need to end it now...um...you, you were the killer.""

253,veemoffa,ambitious film that falls a little short of the mark,8,11 August 2002,"It's Britain between the wars, and a large group of aristocrats--and their servants--are gathering for a weekend shooting party at a magnificent country estate.  As the servants bustle downstairs, their masters go about their own business, which generally involves being as nasty to each other as they can possibly be. Intrigue abounds, both upstairs and downstairs,and the viewer soon understands that there is something very sinister just below the surface.There are outsiders here as well: a film star, who is treated with condescension by the gentry, and adulation by the servants;  a Scottish valet who isn't what he seems to be;  and an American producer who is present to do research for a movie (one of the ironies of this film is that all his research is for the sake of a Charlie Chan movie--a series not noted for realism).Tensions continue to mount, until --sure enough--a particularly nasty member of this crowd gets murdered.  No one seems to care much, including the incompetent police inspector, who is much more interested in pouring the coffee properly than in good detective work.This is a beautiful, rich movie, filled with nuances and ironies that can't be grasped in just one viewing.  To be sure, it has its flaws.  There are so many characters that it is hard to remember who is who. And the dialogue is often very hard to understand (closed captioning would be a big help). ""Gosford Park""'s biggest drawback, though, is that, in spite of a couple of intense scenes, it fails to involve us emotionally. This is a film that delights the intellect, but leaves the heart unmoved.I never-the-less strongly recommend it. Some individual scenes are real gems.  One of my favorites:  The spoiled countess, who, feeling a little chilly before breakfast, demands her fur stole (a simple sweater just isn't good enough).  Or the part when the film star is singing and the gentry are stifling yawns--but the servants are having a great time. Or...well, see the movie and choose your own favorite.",Gosford Park

Then suddenly the curtain pulls up and you see what's happened! A very clever period drama (and comedy) about a dysfunctional party of people, with complex ties between them. The masters and the servants are supposed to be separated, but neither side clings to that rule.

257,denisejhale,Altman's knowing camera highlights 1930's class obsessions.,9,8 February 2002,"As I sat down to view Gosford Park with Becky and Gina the thought crossed my mind, `Could the film live up to its hype? Five minutes in and Becky leant over and gushed in my left ear `This is wonderful!' I nodded my agreement. The film is deliciously wicked as it allows the viewer to observe the idiosyncrasies of people who are unaware they process any. The plot is not overly complex and is certainly not the strength of this movie. The structure of this film is in its interplay of characters and the contrast between the vital world below stairs and the bored existence of the upper classes. The introduction of an American into this world provides an alien perspective though which the audience can identify. 	 One of the complexities of the film is in remembering who's who, especially upstairs. `Which one's Lord Stockton?' whispered Gina in my right ear. And a discussion on the journey home revealed that Becky believed Sylvia's sister was her daughter, which would have given her a very odd relationship with Bill!  My advice is to pay attention to those casual introductions you will be tested later!I also wished that I had known more about the Charlie Chan movies that the American supposedly produced. Research afterwards revealed that there were a series of thirties B movies in which a Chinese detective competently solved crimes. Thus Stephen Fry's bumbling detective is an antithesis of this fictional character. Perhaps there is an element of truth in that a modern audience, used to watching TV detectives gather evidence and solve crimes, are more knowledgeable about the methods of deduction than a nineteen-thirties, English, police inspector would have been. As Stephen Fry's performance has been highlighted in several reviews as the weakest link perhaps I am looking to justify it. However as the audience I was with definitely found it amusing perhaps that is sufficient justification for its presence.One of the advice bytes a writer is always reading is show don't tell'. Early in the movie Elsie (Emily Watson) warns Mary (Kelly MacDonald) of George's wandering hands'. However throughout the movie there is no indication of this vice from George (Richard E Grant). Although nicotine addiction and a willingness not to waste good wine are displayed! In a film of outstanding performances Richard's was one of my favourites, with his malicious remarks and permanent expression of disdain there was a definite edge to his presence in any scene. Another character I enjoyed watching was Mabel (Claudie Blakley), the wife of the obnoxious Nesbit (James Wilby) who had only been invited to make up numbers. She is the female outsider in this upper class habitat and is easy to overlook as unimportant. No character in this tableau is unimportant. The most memorable dialogue is in the expert hands of Maggie Smith who delivers it with such a wonderful, naivety that she reminded me of my 7 year old, who seems to specialise in outrageous comments issued in total innocence. My impression, from the recent Altman Omnibus, was that the director wanted to remove that air of knowing' which permeates most period dramas. In the finished product I was aware of his success in this endeavour. The film is a glimpse into a moment of people's lives. Everyone is busy with their own lives, and, particularly with the staff, we are conscious of their individuality. There are reflections on the past, but there is a stronger awareness of the present. The future has not happened yet. The death of the master may force the sale of the house, there may be a trial, a film may be made and a war may be coming, but in the meantime the silver has to be polished, and meals cooked and served.Finally, before you all think this hierarchical society is part of British history.

No single actor dominates or over-acts. There are about a dozen characters who I really cared about. Surely only a director or Altman's calibre could have got such a cast together.I am always amazed by the dynamics downstairs and have often noticed the similarity with a corporate environment. Downstairs is an office with all the gossip; Jennings/Wilson the management.The murder mystery is secondary to the story and you do not expect justice in the normal sense; no one is found guilty and arrested.Each (almost) of the rich folk upstairs have a servant downstairs, known there by the name of their master.

260,dylan-cross,A cinematic portrait of post WWI British aristocracy.,7,24 November 2005,"GOSFORD PARK is definitely not a standard ""whodunnit"" movie with winding plot twists and suspenseful sequences that keep the viewer on the edge of the sofa from beginning to end. Instead, it's a brilliantly produced film that gives a fluid portrayal of British aristocracy circa the 1930s. Viewers expecting a story with a Doyle or Agatha Christie twist could be disappointed from watching this film due to the movie being a complex drama versus a mystery. However, there are two good things about this movie that really captured my attention: 1)the pompous-like British aristocrats and 2) the servants that attend them.The film itself gives a generally realistic look at upper-class British life through the guise of Lord William and his guests. Secluded from society in a countryside manor, we see the goals and motivations that drive the characters. I guess what really impressed me about this group of characters was the contempt that I felt for most of them. Apart from a few of the guests, the majority portrayed in the film were conceited, vain, and just utterly selfish. I simply loathed most of the assemblage, and I think this is why I particularly admired the quality of the film. Simply, this is a film depicting the lives of these individuals and their interwoven relationships.While displaying a collection of pompous aristocrats, the film does a great job juxtaposing that same group with the servants of the manor. I particularly enjoyed the attention to detail that was used in filming the actors that performed as butlers, valets, cooks, maids, and chauffeurs. Through their eyes we see the challenges they faced, both professionally and personally. One crucial scene that I thought was powerful, although brief, was Elsie's flagrant outburst against Lord William's wife in the middle of a dinner party. The timing of that particular dialog was exact, tense, and well placed. Kudos to the director.There are probably five or six other reasons that I could use in convincing anyone to go see this film. The only negative thing I'd have to say about the story overall is that most of the plot dragged in certain places and was a bit slow-paced. I'd have to give it a 7 out of ten for that, but overall a good film to watch.",Gosford Park

They've lifted the few bright moments from the movie and have inserted them into the trailer.  Don't be fooled into believing the raves of critics. This movie desperately needs a fast forward button to get through the slow bits.  Jeremy Northam and Ryan Phillippe turn in good performances.  Maggie Smith is slowly turning into Bette Davis (although she's not half as scary). Helen Mirren is also quite good, although her storyline is very predictable.

I don't think it was a bad movie at all... In fact, I think that it deserved most of the awards that it got.  HOWEVER, the worst part of the entire night of the Oscars was when Gosford Park beat Memento in the best original screenplay category.  WHAT IS UP WITH THAT???

This tired, cliched mix of social satire, murder mystery and ill-placed slapstick is the favorite pick of the more ""intellectual"" movie reviewing crowd? Good heavens. The ""surprise"" revelations which keep coming at us at snail's pace are stock elements of any Agatha Christie novel (the identity of the murderer, the reason for the murder, the relationships between all the people involved, down to the very identities of the perpetrators). The acting is uneven (the American ""butler"" is particularly atrocious, while Helen Mirren is outstanding); Stephen Fry as the bumbling inspector is an embarrassing and jarring sight, completely out of place; none of the dialogue is particularly witty (does anybody seriously think Maggie Smith's supercilious, mean-spirited remarks deserve any points for being clever?). And none of the people are in any way convincingly drawn, the servants as little as the masters - take the final scene with Helen Mirren, for instance, which I'm sure is meant to leave us gasping in wonder, pity and understanding. To me, that scene summed up what was wrong with the movie: a character doing and saying something that was completely out of her style, so that we could have a nicely resolved ending.Oh, and did I mention that all the characters involved are stock figures as well (the Bitchy Trophy Wife, the Devoted Butler, the Upstart Ambitious American, the Poor Grasping Relations, the Conniving Rich Man, the Ingenue Servant etc.)? This is what Robert Altman, who gave us ""Nashville"" and ""The Player"" has come down to? Sic transit gloria mundi. Perhaps he should have stopped directing after ""Ready to Wear"" (which was almost as bad as ""Gosford Park"".) It is interesting to note, however, that the American public (including movie reviewers) still imbues anything vaguely English and aristocratic with intellectualism, artistic merit and a whiff of exoticism.

In the director's commentary Altman said ""I don't really care that much about story in a film. I think more of it as painting."" That becomes obvious in Gosford Park. Many people that I've talked with about Gosford Park have said they disliked it because as a whodunit, it's really awful. Well, okay. But I think that Altman doesn't really care about the whodunit as the point, but rather as just a vehicle to expose the inner workings of the manor. It's really more of a ""whydunit""--what motivates the characters and why they do what they do.If you like the film reasonably well, WATCH THE WRITER'S COMMENTARY! Not the director's, which is okay. The writer's commentary is fascinating. The writer talks about how life works in the English upper crust and in the servant's lives downstairs.

I am a avid filmgoer and I have sat through thousands of films, however, this one left me squirming in my seat. I waited for what seemed like an eternity for the film to end.  It takes alot for me to be bored by even the worst of films but this one sure did.You might be thinking from my previous comments that I think this is a terrible film but you would be wrong in that assumption.  In fact I think the film has been admirable assests.  The cast is superb but they are not forced to strain themselves at all as there are no stand-out perfomances. There are far too many characters and storylines for even a 10-hour movie. It would have been better to simply cut out perhaps a dozen unimportant characters and stick to the real meat of the story.  But if Altman had done that he would not be able to brag about the great cast he has.  While some may argue that the whole point of the film is the fact there are so many plotlines I think that is alot of crap, good films have a coherent, compelling storyline, enough said.For years I have heard about how great a director Altman is.  Am I missing something?  I just don't understand what everyone sees in him.  Never once has he directed from a good script, it always seems like he just shows up on the set points a camera in the direction of the actors and expects magic to happen.  It very rarely does.  M*A*S*H was just okay, same goes with The Long Goodbye and The Player but just about every other film he has done has ranged from mediocre to crap.  His work here is no different, the way he constantly moves his camera is particularly distracting and annoying.Of course the geniuses in the Academy have decided to overlook other great films and directors of 2001 and instead nominate this film for best picture and director.

What was this movie doing in the list for the Oscar's I wonder...  Such a great cast, so much rubbish.  Too bad !  Give me back Shortcuts please, at least that was excellent !",Gosford Park
278,astorian,"Not as bad as most Altman films, but bad enough",4,11 July 2002,"Coming on the heels of stinkers like ""Dr. T"" and ""Ready to Wear,"" I suppose a tepid, boring, underdeveloped, mediocre film like ""Gosford Park"" is a step up for Robert Altman. Still, it's not very good. Altman has occasionally shown a talent for juggling large numbers of characters and multiple plot lines, but this time, there are just WAY too many characters to keep track of, and almost none of the characters are developed. You'll probably find yourself struggling to remember who many of them are.The murder mystery itself is the weakest element of the movie. It will be obvious to almost everyone who stabbed the old man and why. And it will be equally obvious who REALLY killed the old man, and why.
So, is there ANYTHING worthwhile? Sure, a few solid performances. Maggie Smith, in particular, is hilarious. But that's about it.",Gosford Park
279,soloview,Empty beauty,6,11 August 2002,"Visually, lovely. 'Upstairs, Downstairs'-like staff superior. Story line, unfulfilling. Mystery? Duh, got it in no time (and was not even trying).Robert Altman always falls short for me. Great texture, little essence. If I had cared for even one character, perhaps it would have made a difference. The only one even slightly interesting to me was the 'Mystery' ex-detective from ""Second Sight"" -- would like to have focused more deeply on him. As an Anglophile, knew nearly everyone. But even their individual & collective skills could not bring this story to life for me. And talk about s-l-o-w!!! The first 45 minutes were excruciating.

Gosford park is full of every single cliché that has ever been raked over in a thousand British films, TV series, and even plays since the 1920's. It's much like Noel Coward's The Vortex crossed with a cheap made for TV Mrs Marple adaption. If you're interested in story lines focusing on British upper-class hypocrisy, murder mysteries, and the upstairs downstairs dynamic, I strongly suggest you skip this and go looking for a few good Mrs Marple TV adaptions, you'll certainly get a better class of writing.",Gosford Park
282,cherry_daze,Slow burner,8,24 April 2005,"When I first attempted to watch this, I was much put off. An endless surplus of characters who looked alike, horrible sound quality and a slow narrative all resulted in me giving up.I have to admit, the principal reason was the sound quality. (I rented the film out on DVD, the UK version. And I couldn't hear a thing they were saying. If I turned up the volume I was bombarded with loud music..) But on watching it again last night (on terrestrial TV), with the help of subtitles, I found this to be an absolute delight.Sure, the characters still looked the same, and the narrative was probably made even slower by the perpetual commercials, but at heart, I loved this film.I think that when you just relax and make peace with the fact that no, it isn't story driven, and know that no, you won't finally know the names of all the characters, you can just sit back and enjoy the dialogue, which is littered with jems and stunning one liners.Overall, give this a go.

I also liked the intimacy that we shared with both the domestic staff and the aristocracy portrayed in this film - it was gossipy and sympathetic at the same time. We learn that people are people regardless of social status - they just have different responsibilities. I always enjoy Clive Owen and Helen Mirren. The addition of a crass American movie maker to the English weekend was funny. The death of the host was incidental to the goings-on of each of the guests. Money needs, affection needs, connection needs - each represented what we all strive to attain - but this movie represents it with the stiff upper lip that ever propels the English.

A murder in oder to make people pay attention to otherwise useless drivel. CHECK!

285,damamirlo,How can this movie have a score of just a seven? It's an indisputable ten!,10,29 November 2008,"Some times, when voting here in the IMDb, if I think the movie has an unfairly low score, I give it a higher one just to compensate. But this is NOT one of those times. I'm giving Gosford Park a ten out of ten just because it deserves it. It's one of the best movies with the best scripts and the best acting I've ever seen. Everyone in the cast deserved the Oscar for supporting character (since there is no real protagonist).The only reason why people shouldn't find this movie as great as it is, is if they want action and special effects (you won't find those here); or if they don't like character-driven movies full of dialog (it's all about the characters and the dialog); or if they didn't understand it (if you don't pay attention, you might not get what's happening). For everyone who likes a good plot, good imagery, good photography, good acting, and not being treated like an idiot by both the screenwriter and the director, this movie is a must.And a ten.But, I warn you again: if you want action, this is not your movie. It is a movie about characters, personality, and acting. Most of the things that are told aren't actually said, you have to read between the lines or in the faces of the actors. And as someone said, you have to pay attention to who's who and what their relationships are.But whoever said this is the ""worst movie ever"" should be banned from voting in the IMDb. You can say ""I don't like this type of movie because it's just people talking, though the scenery is great and the acting good"". You can say ""I wanted some explosions and hotter women with less clothing"". But you can't say this is a bad movie. It's a masterpiece. But it's a masterpiece about characters, plot, relationships, acting and setting. Not an action movie.",Gosford Park
286,JustinK-2,"A lovely, clever and subtle period piece; if you can slow down to its pace ...",7,12 August 2002,"A lovely film - and if you're the type of person who would never describe a film as 'lovely' this is probably the first warning that you may not like Gosford Park.If you're wanting to see a period murder mystery a la Agatha Christie you may have to think again because though this has many of the same elements if you watch it for the mystery part you could be disappointed. It was, in my opinion a little misleadingly, advertised as such - ""Tea At Four. Dinner At Eight. Murder At Midnight"" but I suppose advertising it with the tagline - ""Tea At Four. Dinner At Eight. Up Early for Shooting Pheasant"" isn't really going to bring in the crowds ...If the murder mystery part is not so important to you, however, and you want to see a wonderful period piece, with great actors and acting, a very subtle, dark humour full of character interaction this may be for you.I won't really go into the murder plot - it happens so late in the film and is practically given a back seat to the fact it has inconvenienced all the rest of the guests (and staff) that it's virtually secondary to their interactions. Actually it is really only there to hang this 'study' onto and to make a specific point at the end of the film. This is a weakness for sure and I would have preferred more emphasis on this and the resulting ending but that flaw is not a fatal one when you have a cast like this for a period drama;   Maggie Smith [Room With a View, Harry Potter] - faultless as the visiting Countess   Michael Gambon [Singing Detective]- the host, Sir William, with his hands on too many people's purse strings   Kristen Scott Thomas [Four Weddings ..., English Patient] - born to play a 1930s Lady and does so here with brilliance   Charles Dance [Last Action Hero, Dark Blue World] - the English Lord Helen Mirren [Prime Suspect, Madness of King George] - the perfect housekeeper   Derek Jacobi [Cadfael, Hamlet] - leading the household servants   Alan Bates [Love in a Cold Climate, Hamlet] - a superb butler   Richard E Grant [Scarlet Pimpernel]- George the 1st footman, always off for a crafty smoke   Stephen Fry [Peter's Friends, Wilde] - the bumbling police inspector ... and many more who play their parts perfectly - the Lord who married beneath himself for money, the suspicious wife, a visiting American film producer, downstairs staff and upstairs guests having affairs both within in without of their station, the relatives requiring investments, a man with a mystery past, the military men, the men who avoided the military ... all this and Ivor Novello too. All have some secrets and almost all of them are revealed by the end of this movie.Actually Stephen Fry as the police inspector to me was the only small let down. I think his humour, though exceptionally well done, lacked the subtlety and darkness seen throughout the rest of the picture so stood out as a bit of an incongruity ... nevertheless he got away with it and I'm sure for many his will be the funniest bits of the film!It has been alleged that the film is very hard to hear with many (mostly seemingly US citizens) needing to use subtitles to catch all being said due to more than one person speaking at once and or speaking in a quiet voice plus being a difficult film to follow anyway. Yes, you do have to concentrate to keep up with the characters because of their large number, intricate machinations and (usually sordid and or selfish) intentions but I must say, as an Englishman I had no problem with making out the dialogue and various accents (even the many Scottish ones <g>). In fact I found the way voices were overlapped and heard in the background simply added not only to the realism but also the atmosphere ... no permanent rumble of traffic or piped music in the background just the low mumble of half-heard voices.Atmosphere - that's really a lot of what this film is about after all. It tries, and in my opinion succeeds, in capturing the atmosphere of the 30s (it is set in 1932) - of the slower pace of life, of the distinct class attitudes from both Upstairs and Downstairs and of the interactions of people of that age. This may be why the film seems so slow to many viewers that are used to the fast pacing and deliberate plotting of a modern Hollywood movie.In fact anyone used to the fast pacing of modern life, let alone films, *may* find it hard to slow down and appreciate the grandeur of this film and to express my thoughts below is a table of the present scoring received on the IMdB by a modern comedy (I've chosen Something About Mary as a popular comedy with the exact opposite type of humour) and Gosford Park. Obviously this is a coarse tool but it does seem to make its point...Something About Mary: 18-29yrs: 7.4, 30-44: 7.0, 45+: 6.6, Male: 7.3, Female: 6.8Gosford Park	18-29yrs: 7.4, 3-44: 7.8, 45+: 8.0, Male: 7.5, Female: 8.0Quite noticeably as the audience gets older the score rises for Gosford Park and falls for Something About Mary. At my 36 years I must admit I enjoyed much more the delicate and restrained humour of the former to the in your face and (to me) often juvenile humour of Something About Mary.
To support this age bias; for the ""Director's Chair"" showing in my local cinema I seemed to be one of the youngest in the packed theatre ... what you read into this is up to you!To support the male/female split ""It makes a change from the usual blood and violence films you take me to"" was the comment as we approached the cinema from my fiancée ... yes it was her choice, but I for one am really glad that she made that choice!Of course all the above just shows a trend and certainly doesn't mean you'll like or dislike it just because you fall into one specific bracket or another but maybe it'll help you to decide if this is your 'kind of movie'; I hope so.In summary the plot and ending lacked direction but this clever, subtle period piece needed neither to make it worth watching if you can keep down to the pace ...7/10",Gosford Park
287,Flookboy,Refined,8,20 July 2002,"Firstly I have to say, what the hell is wrong with the majority of the people who have commented on this film. Boring, rubbish, dull, this film is most certainly not. I have heard bitching about how hard it is to follow what is going on, that the storyline is rubbish, the dialog is rubbish, the acting is rubbish. Was I watching the same film? Apparently not!This film is slow I will happily admit, but whats the point of having a remotely speedy movie when all Altman is trying (and in my opinion succeeding) to do is to convey the atmosphere at the time. Do you ever wonder why old people moan about every one being in a hurry in this day and age? Its because compared to there time it is. As for the viewer not being able to follow whos who throughout the film. It doesnt matter, and for me is subtly the point. The majority of the people are out for themselves and dont mind who they screw over to get what they want, but at the same time hypocritically look down on everyone else. The only characters who you really start to follow and recognise are those who have, well character, and in this case this tends to be the servants due to the fact that they dont spend all their time doing one thing, looking out for themselves. When watching this movie you have to keep in mind that it is less about murder and more about the 1930's and the people in it. The murder only highlights what we already know, that no-ones cares about the deceased but only what it means for them, and the fact that the dead man was hated by so many simply highlights that he angered many by again,looking out for himself. Oh and to the person calling themselves Kanerazor. If you think that Memento (admittedly screwed over at the Oscars along with Tennenbaums) was wittier than this then you must have either been asleep or deaf and blind as Steven Fry's character is one of the most ineptly funny characters I have seen for a long time!",Gosford Park

There were so many characters that one was left quite confused when someone's name was thrown about in conversation. i don't know how they could've possibly fixed this character problem, but i would argue that the problem is this shouldn't be a movie. i believe it could fair well as a book, however in movie form it was a big nothing. I was bored through much of it (back to that tea thing) and that which did happen was lame. Even those of my grouping that did enjoy it were unsure of what had happened at times. The murder motives while i guess were valid were still a little shakey in my opinion. I also found the conversation to be dull and nothing important not repeated at least 2 or 3 times...well if such things weren't repeated then i myself probably would've been clueless to the happenings of the movie. It just wasn't anything. There were one or two niftty little focus shifts but in such a long movie this was hardly enough to keep me entertained.

290,ctando,Beautiful but distant,6,29 June 2002,"This movie had almost no characters worth caring about. The ""main"" character of Mary is the sweetest and most sympathetic. Most characters are just awful. I couldn't imagine wanting to spend any amount of time with these people. The rich are mostly greedy and amoral while the servants are downtrodden and amoral.I guess these are *spoilers* ahead.  One character is revealed as a sleazy bisexual sex fiend. I didn't see the need for the inclusion of homosexuality. The thing that really bothers me the most about this film is the attitude at the end. Once the killer is revealed, no one bothers to notify the police. The idea is,""Why bother? It would do more harm than good. After all, he deserved it."" This is a very callous and dangerous attitude.
Other than that the film was well-made. The setting and costumes are lush and the cast is star-studded. Strangely enough it is Kelly MacDonald as Mary that saves the film for me. 6/10",Gosford Park

292,brubonch,as mysterious as the brain of a cockroach,3,4 December 2009,"Well, where to I start... I guess the most important thing that comes to mind in connection with this movie is that it is NOT, NEVER ANY SORT OF DETECTIVE STORY. NEVER. In terms of prioritizing, the mystery-solving element or suspense is in the umpteenth place. It is almost completely IRRELEVANT here, because by the time something does start to happen in this flick(idle talk aside) it is way past the midpoint. I kept wondering: when will it start, when will it actually start, when will somebody do something AT LAST???. But it was hopeless - a detective story it was not to be, but just a neverending sequence of idle aristocratic talk about NOTHING (plain gossip for the most part) set in some rural estate somewhere in time. On a bright side, though, is the cast - it is impressive, performances are good, natural, and believable - we must stay honest and give the makers credit for that. But again, otherwise this film is a complete waste of time, unless of course gossip, meaningless talk and details of servants' way of life is what you look for in a detective story. My mark is 3 for one and only reason - acting (the only ray of light here). Other than that it was BOREDOM epitomized.",Gosford Park

It's more than just the British accents, it's actors mumbling their lines, and poor sound quality overall.  It was extremely difficult hearing the actors, not to mention trying to keep track of who's who. I frequently watch British films and television shows and my ears are quite familiar with British accents, so that was not the issue as some comments have mentioned. Be warned that you will be in for hard work trying to follow the storyline. I haven't been this disappointed and let-down about a movie in a long time. What a waste!",Gosford Park

295,amigoPaulo,de-glamorizing the past,10,27 May 2002,"British people are wedded to the past.  Living in England, one is dished up a glamorized version of the Victorian golden era, but it is rare to hear critical comments about this period.  Even today, the films produced about this era deal with the upper classes playing their little games or solving yet another silly murder.Gosford Park is a movie that debunks and de-glamorizes the Victorian era. Although the surface image of this era may be glamorous due to the opulent setting and the sophistication of its characters, the film reveals the upper classes as a shallow, snobbish and mean spirited bunch.  The aristocrats barely tolerate each other, and their meetings have a lot to do with obtaining allowances from the wealthy factory owner who grudgingly subsidized the lot.  This time the tolerance gives way to outright hostility because the industrialist refuses to distribute allowances that were forthcoming in the past.    Once the economic relationship is brought into question, the false gentility gives way to a bare disdain.What sets the film apart is that it is also willing to explore the people who are usually in the background in other films.  The butlers and the maids also have a story, one often intertwined with that of their masters.  At Gosford Park all the servants lose their identity - they are not referred to by their own names, but are referred to as `servant to X'.  Not only is their identity erased, but also more pernicious aspects of the abuse of power become evident.  Yet another myth of this most prudish of eras is debunked and it pertains to sexual exploitation.  It is clear from the film that the alternative to working at this ghastly house is abject poverty, and thus there was little alternative to what amounted to prostitution.
The film culminates with the murder of the industrialist - and it reveals that everyone has an ax to grind.  Below the veneer of upper class gentility resides an egoistic and shallow bunch of people with little regard for others.  The servants are victims of their circumstances, but some of them are perhaps willing participants.Gosford Park does us all a favor by demolishing the glamorized history of the time.  It is time to take the good bits of history, and safely jettison and question the remainder.  This film will make you think twice before going to the next Victorian period film that pops up.",Gosford Park

297,ryansternmd,"Altman's murder mystery version of ""Upstairs, Downstairs""",10,24 January 2010,"I have watched this film several times trying to keep up with the action. There is one murder and 41 suspects! I eventually had to go to IMDb to get the character list to try to keep up with who is who, upstairs and downstairs, with an attempt to keep track of who had a motive. After several attempts, I decided that it would be a fun parlor game to provide guests a list of characters and try to keep track of individuals' motives and try to guess ""who did it"". It would be a very few number of people who would have enough interest in film and mysteries to actually do it. Most viewers would throw up their hands in frustration and wait for the end of the film and find out ""who did it"". The most striking thing to me about the film is the strict British adherence to etiquette and class distinctions. The prejudicial response to the US guest and his valet, especially by Maggie Smith's character, is amusing. But it is the disrespect and abuse by the upstairs guests to the downstairs servants that makes the film so confusing. But, when the film is over, you have a greater appreciation for the British adherence to etiquette and class distinction.

There isn't a single scene without one servant in the room, and that's what makes the movie interesting. Usually you see the movie from the ""upstair people,"" or the rich people. However, Robert Altman decided to use the servants as the key to the mystery. He also brought the characters pasts alive. The murderer did it because of revenge, and he did it well.

The humor was sprinkled in just the right doses - and the bottom line is that I simply must see this again.  Too many things to digest.  Every guest had such stories of their own.  Kristin Scott Thomas was cooly beautiful and Emily Watson, sexy in her slip. Great mystery abounds. It simply has to have a second screening, to filter out all the subplots and get to the ""who dunnit"" part.  This movie is ""a keeper"" - stays on your mind and makes you think.

302,ariesjow,Why this may be Altman's greatest film...and easily one of the best of 2001.,8,19 June 2002,"Let me start out by saying this is not a film for people that do not like or understand filming. This is not a normal murder mystery. In fact, its not even about the murder. Its about the characters! If you are used to normal popcorn flicks and know nothing nor care about huge ensemble pieces, directing, or characterization you probably will not appreciate this film for its powers. Save your money. It will probably bore you. Robert Altman introduces a wide range of aristocrats and their servants and spends three-fourth of his film letting them show you their various personalities through their interactions with each other. And he's devilishly subtle about it leaving dialogue and visuals low-key when they should be. People who have already seen this film should make a special note to remember how each single character was practically introduced in some shape or form. There is almost not a person staying at Gosford Park that does not get their word in and does not add to the intrigue of the plot. The storyline is set with people who have motives to kill and subtle hints are given to the reasonings of the killer...but the killer remains to be known until the end and by then you don't mind the killer or his/her reasonings. This is perhaps the best casted ensemble piece I have ever seen. Every person is their character. Every person is believable. Helen Mirren's performance is a near flawless example of an affective quiet role. Maggie Smith was perfectly casted as the snippy Aunt Constance. Kristen Scott Thomas plays the uber-bitch lady of the house to the t. The list goes on... I almost felt that AMPAS could have filled the Best Supporting Actress category with women from this film and been perfectly justified.

Instead, we drift through the house, upstairs and downstairs, watching the events of a shooting weekend at a magnificent old-money house in the (very rainy) English countryside, piecing together characters by catching a snippet of conversation here, a liaison there.We're watching from the point of view of the servants (there's one in every scene). Some characters are more thoroughly explored than others, but even those who aren't particularly foregrounded feel like people we aren't really getting to know rather than underdeveloped extras. As a result, a few of the plot lines (especially the two involving letters) are obscured in the general texture of the piece, and some are never resolved at all, but again this feels deliberate - we catch intriguing glimpses, but do not get to know the whole story. If this sounds frustrating, let me assure you that it's entirely the opposite - it makes everything even more absorbing. Like life, we don't get all the answers.There is a plot, in the classic whodunnit style, but to concentrate on this plot is to miss the point of the film entirely. That said, the secrets brought to light by the murder are heartbreaking, and 'who' is nowhere near as significant as 'why'. But the focus of this film (such as it is) is on the subtly developing characters, the rich production design and the satisfaction of feeling things fall into place in your head as you mentally assemble the various plots and characters from the details you've managed to 'overhear'.The film leaves me with a feeling of melancholy - of nostalgic regret that such a grand (albeit classist and exploitative) way of life had to end, and that change is on the way.",Gosford Park
308,onlinebirgit,Best Movie Ever,10,14 June 2014,"Gosford Park is not at all about class revolution, nor about fast cinema. It's like a ironic documentary, a scientist's experimental setting, of people and classes who are placed together in a closed surrounding, meeting each other, moving upwards and downwards, leading their own lives, being dependent on each other and pretending not to care. I just love the movie. Can see it over and over again - when you know the plot, you can drop the subtitles and concentrate even more on the whole. I love the extremely well worked-out interiors. Everything in that movie is done with a crazy care for detail: up to the choice of cars (snobbish ladyship Trentham in a ways too old, once elegant model, the young folk in a sportive Bentley), the complexity of tasks, tools and handwork that the servants perform all the time, the subtle hints of the camera to what's going to take place... That movie shows a whole society in a nutshell. And when you know HOW it was done - with the advice of real servants on the set, original jewelery, right clothes and a lot of acting carefully like in the real old movies - you understand why it's so convincing. I love the complexity of the plot. So many lives and stories in that little universe: every person's important. And never seen a more convincing way of telling important facts to the viewer in a very natural way. I loved the personages, and am still moved to tears at the end. No way, ten stars.",Gosford Park

Each line and scene in this movie is part of an overall picture. If you blink, talk, look away you will miss a piece of a magnificent puzzle. This cast may be one of the most collectively talented casts you could put together. Each member seems to blend in so well that you don't even realize they are acting. I have watched the movie several times and the commentary and I still have a hard time thinking of the characters as anything but who they are in the movie. The set, the lighting, the little bits all add up to an amazing piece of work that should be watched when quiet and in a time when you can really take in the whole story. It is a time that has gone by, a life that has faded, a lifestyle no longer being lived and yet this snapshot makes it feel so very close. The mystery is is not only interesting, but heartfelt. Without giving away plot points, my favorite scene is towards the end between two actresses who are legends and who both prefer the scene with realism and caring without being over the top.A must see if you have ever watched and enjoyed ""Downton Abbey"", take time to see this masterpiece.",Gosford Park

The ""mystery"" is especially lame, and the character of the inspector seems to have required no more than ten seconds' thought on the part of its creators.  The cast, of course, is impressive -- Emily Watson and Helen Mirren are particularly good -- but one cannot escape the sense that most of them are wasted here.

312,hart_keith,a tragic satire of British society,8,14 April 2002,"I saw this film yesterday in Paris. Experiencing it with a French audience no doubt enhanced its power to reinforce the feeling of being in voluntary exile from Britain. Today I have been haunted by recurrent images of the servants' domain, a warren of low corridors, cramped rooms and frantic industry that I had never seen before. The grandeur of life upstairs we have all seen many times, but never in such a context of servants' lives. The image was of a workhouse or factory jammed into the basement of a palace. Factories play a significant role in the story: the lord of the manor owns several and a number of the servants started out in them. Imagine what life in the factories was like (the film is set in the 1930s) if domestic service of this kind was a step up.The overwhelming tenor of the society is one of brutality. The owners behave savagely towards the servants and to each other. The servants reproduce this in their own hierarchies. Only Americans could have made this movie, since the British are still seduced by the national glory the lifestyle represents. The plot is eventually a murder mystery, but no-one pays much notice to the victim, since it seems to be a natural expression of the culture he embodied. Gosford Park is so parodic of the Agatha Christie genre invented in this period as to point up the bitterness of the social satire. There are not many jokes.What then is this magnificent cast of British actors doing in such a movie? Many of the greatest of them on show perform as servants: the superb Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Alan Bates, Eileen Atkins. Some of the others create memorable upper class monsters: Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott-Thomas. Does this express what they feel about their role in a British society dependent on Americans to make films? The creaking plot device of an invasion of Hollywood types doesn't quite work, but it does allow us to see the British as others see them.What makes this film tragic for me is that it depicts the appallingly recent source of a contemporary Britain that has not shaken off the loss of an empire it made in the image of the society revealed here. I grew up after the war, but my journey from the provincial lower classes to Oxbridge and beyond constantly exposed me to the residue of this brutal class hierarchy. It is the mark of a great movie to make us feel that we are seeing something new. Altman has done us all a favour by exposing upstairs/downstairs without any hint of mystique. I wonder if, when seen through the cultural blinkers of London's suburbs, it provokes nostalgia, not pity, if only to witness so many of our greatest actors as servants looking their age.",Gosford Park
313,mlbou,"Overrated period, overrated piece",6,4 February 2002,"Robert Altman's film ""Gosford Park"" is indicative of the period it portrays: overrated, cliched, repetitive, and unexciting. There is so little new to this film that one half-seriously wonders if plagarism lawyers are working feverishly at his studio to protect this so-called ""Oscar-worthy"" performance.This film teaches us that rich people are sluts and scoundrels obsessed with their petty squabbles (we knew that already). It entertains us by giving us almost two hours of set up, 10 minutes of rising action and then with 10 minutes left a climax. The tagline ""tea at 4...murder by midnight"" is right...It does seem like it takes 8 hours for the climax to get there.There are many who claim that this film is artistic and that Altman is a genius for interweaving so many storylines into the piece. I however contend that no storyteller ever becomes great by confusing his audience, by intentionally adding in more characters than he knows what to do with, by underdeveloping the characters to such a point that they only reinforce how one-dimensional and cliched they really are, by adding scene after scene to show the same thing, and by slowing the pace to the point that more happens in the theater itself than the film in the course of the showing. Yes, some great works of art do confuse the masses, but that doesn't mean that all films that confuse the masses are great.This film in essence is like the sentence ""Murder, sex, at, rich, clothes, servants, dogs, jokes, stupid Americans""---There's just too much detail and no real point to it. If you must see this film sit in the front of the theater and face back toward the projector...that view is surely more interesting than the film behind you.",Gosford Park
314,wsbutler,Where's the mystery?,5,26 July 2002,"Gosford Park was an eagerly anticipated rental at our house, especially with the caliber of talent appearing. As a character study, it was first rate. I especially enjoyed watching Alan Bates interacting with Derek Jacobi and Helen Mirren.

315,bodnotbod,"At first, hard to follow. Later, you wonder why you bothered.",3,22 April 2005,"I struggled with this film despite being a fan of Robert Altman, particularly his film Short Cuts. Like Short Cuts this film has a large cast of central characters who speak in a very naturalistic low-key way, often talking over the babble of characters in the background.I don't know whether to blame it on my cheap home set-up but, unlike Short Cuts, I found the dialogue hard to follow - particularly during the first half of the film. Naturally this hampers your enjoyment, especially in a film such as this which is very focused on speech.Without wanting to give anything away, following the first half of the film there is an event which gives you cause to reflect on the motivations of all the characters. This was clearly a problem for me, having been unable to make out a good deal of the early dialogue.However, I did feel at the end - and I'm sure this would be true even with the benefit of a full appreciation of the early story - that the film was rather flat. It's beautifully shot with a wonderful period feel. Another Altman trademark is the shot that makes you a voyeur or stalker witnessing people going about their business blissfully unaware that you're looking on. But these perhaps add to a sense that things are simply too played down and uninvolving. It's all very quiet.In Shortcuts the action is much more engaging and the characters more fiery, so the devices that play it down give you a feeling that you are witnessing real people in real drama. With Gosford Park you feel you are witnessing real people who are not doing a great deal It's almost like a 1930s Big Brother in that regard.bodnotbod",Gosford Park
316,Alecssei,"Great script wonderfully played, a great cast perfectly directed",10,27 April 2009,"I had heard a lot about 'Gosford Park', that's why I waited so long to get and enjoy it. And did I ever? The movie is based on the exceptional writing of Julian Fellowes and tells the story of some aristocratic wealthy people and their servants in the late fall of 1932. But through the directing of Robert Altman, we come to see, witness and understand much more.Fist of all, we witness the immense difference between the guests, some aristocrats and snobs and others, servants. This difference is underlined by the 'Upstairs' (where the guests sleep) and 'Downstairs' (where the staff and servants sleep, eat and work). We also sense the difference by the clothing, the manners and the snobbish behavior.Second of all, the movie is that incredible, that we witness the grand manner in which wealthy people lived in those days, the way they interacted with their help and we notice that so few things have actually changed through the ages.Britain's finest and a few Hollywood actors had been perfectly casted for this portrait of a decaying Empire, its traditions (which the British are very fond of) and of the always-hunting-for-some-fresh-meat-Hollywood. Because of the brilliant cast, the plot becomes secondary and we are being portrayed a wonderful and apparently boring, typically English, weekend. Rarely have I seen actors master the art of acting so good, that even the boredom of the characters is played perfectly.Robert Altman managed to built an eternal antithesis in this movie, may it be the wealthy vs. the poor people, servant/staff vs. master, 'downstairs' vs. 'upstairs', the British vs. the Americans (""He's from America. They do things differently there""), the calm and apparently boring English man vs. the ever vibrant American, London vs. countryside and even London vs. Hollywood.I highly recommend this movie the anyone and everybody who enjoys acting of the finest art, a craftsmanship performed by some very talented actors.",Gosford Park

Thus, I was a bit surprised and disappointed that I walked away from Gosford Park wondering about the point of it all.Yes, it was an excellent commentary about social class. Yes, the acting was fabulous. However, commentary and acting do not a good movie make. For starters, it was very hard to understand the dialogue in places, especially when Emily Watson was speaking at the beginning of the film. It was very jumbled and poorly edited.Secondly, where, in any of the characters, is there any display of human kindness? One might point to Trentham's maid, Mary, as an example, but even that is a stretch. Altman portrays only misery and empty lives everywhere. Two plus hours of this is more than I care to watch.And finally, if Altman wants to incorporate murder into a plot, do it justice. The introduction of a bumbling inspector was jarring to say the least. The attempt at humor at that late point in the film seems superfluous at best. The murder line drifts away in meaninglessness much like the rest of the film. At least one can give Altman high marks for consistency. 5/10.",Gosford Park

I fail to see any greatness in the direction of Mr. Altman when he can't handle simple matter like introducing characters.  The actors in this film can, for the most part, do these characters in their sleep.  I sincerely doubt they needed much directing. The great Maggie Smith is, as always, the delight of the piece.  The one jarring note is the character of the police inspector - far too much the clown to be believed.  On the whole though, a pleasant jaunt.  Just sit back and enjoy your visit.",Gosford Park
323,Wallace_the_Windows,"Old Genres, New Life",8,9 February 2002,"Odd that there should be so many negative comments about this film on iMDB when the average vote is so high. Not surprising, however, that most of the disgruntled viewers should have had no real idea what to expect from a Robert Altman film when they went into the cinema. This was never going to be a straightforward Agatha Christie-type murder mystery, in fact it went some way to subverting 1930s country-house whodunnit conventions, not least, as someone else pointed out, by making the detective a clueless duffer and thereby avoiding the climactic 'we shall all convene in the drawing room at eight o'clock when I will unmask the murderer' denouement.At the same time, I disagree with the notion that the murder mystery element of the film was almost an afterthought, tied up as it was with everything else the movie was trying to convey. (To say more would warrant a spoiler warning.) Those who worked it out before the truth came explicitly to light and criticized the film as a result are obviously better at sussing out detective fiction that me (and I admit I've always been lousy at it); to them I would simply say that you can understand a murder plot without beginning to get your head around a subtle study of the intricacies of the British class structure.

No, I didn't have a preconceived notion that this was going to be a mystery. I watch it with an open mind, and it was all I can do to make through it. As far as this being a ""comedy"", I'd think a documentary on groundhog would be more entertaining.  While some people see all 138 minutes of fur and small talks as grand, splendid, charming, (notice all the big fat stupid words, oh just like the movie, w00t!) and ""fleshing"" out characters.  I think it is as a mean of fill up 138 minutes.

All these are books that are capturing the heart and soul of people in an particular era and they are so much better than this, this, horrid, thing.

The soundscape takes a little getting used to - realising one is listening to someone off camera to one's right whilst looking at the people to one's left is disorientating for a while, particularly in a mystery-thriller when one doesn't want to miss any 'clues'.I went in a party of four: only two of us picked up who had committed the murder AFTER it had (supposedly) been explained - you do have to concentrate hard.Great acting, hardly a foot or a syllable put wrong: for my money Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi (who steals scenes by NOT doing anything, perfectly in character), Eileen Atkins (weirdly underrated in the UK, much more respected on Broadway)and Richard E. Grant shade the acting honours by a whisker, but it's an ensemble piece, and I'm sure all the cast would say (in public at least) that naming favourites is heinous.All in all, a very good film, but not a Friday night after a meal with a few friends thing.

Folks, I'm not a sadist or anything so don't take this the wrong way, but EVEN THE MURDER WAS BORING.  As for plot, absolutely nothing happened in this film, even with a dead body present.

329,BioChemical,"Atmospheric, absorbing, amusing and really fun.",10,27 December 2004,"With films we recognise as 'Altmanesque' springing from Los Angeles, Marseilles and New Delhi, it's salutary to revel in a classic model by the master of the movie mosaic himself, as he presides over a richly-nuanced screenplay and an ensemble to die for.While wittily referring to the manor mystery genre, this is no whodunnit, but a multi-layered tragicomedy of manners, motives and relationships within a decaying social order.A Who's Who of British Equity proves wonderfully adroit at the idiosyncratic, improvisational Altman Experience - theatrical knights wielding and polishing the silver, great dames slinging arch glances and saucepans. Upstairs, ungracious tycoon Michael Gambon is bedevilled by in-laws. Downstairs, hostility between housekeeper Helen Mirren and cook Eileen Atkins builds to a moving, revelatory confrontation without impeding butler Alan Bates' regulation of the staff.Holding their own in this company are Americans Bob Balaban (Altman's partner in the conception and production) as a coolly-received Hollywood producer and Ryan Phillippe, affecting a purposefully dubious accent, as his highly suspicious valet. Jeremy Northam is just divine as matinée idol Ivor Novello, who's presence provokes sniffs from the aristos but excites the housemaids.The pivotal character is Kelly Macdonald's Mary, the new lady's maid whose quiet labours position her perfectly to observe the misbehaviour and foibles above and below stairs with perception and sympathy. And although Dame Maggie Smith's imperious countess grabs the largest share of memorable lines, everyone has his moment in this inventive and fully-detailed piece. That includes the valet protesting, ""I've washed him and I've dressed him, and if he can't find his own way to the drawing room it's not my fault!"" This is Altman's best movie in years - an astute exploration of British culture that can stand proudly with his satires of American life.

However, in Altman's hands (with some help from the very talented and watchable Bob Balaban), ""Gosford Park"" becomes a true original. The interwoven plots of domestic politics both up and downstairs are a terrific comment on the rigid class distinctions in England. And Americans don't fare much better with Bob Balaban's constant monopolization of the one telephone line in his long distance dealings with Hollywood. Altman's movies are never brief.

339,robertaveryuk,Engage brain please.,8,3 March 2002,"Gosford Park is a thinking persons film.No think, no enjoy film.The relationships between characters aren't laid out on a plate for you: you've got to concentrate and work it out for yourself.  So a big sorry to all those people who like good guys to wear white (and speak with american accents) and bad guys to wear black (and speak with ""foreign"" accents): this film is not for you, you're too stupid and/or lazy to understand it.As for there being no plot...well, the bodycount is low and there aren't any gunfights, but still waters run deep, and there are strong currents in the depths if you're prepared to use your brain to find them.SPOILER COMING UPFor example, Emily Watson's maid makes a fatal error and is fired.  Big wow, you say, but maybe you don't realise what this means to her.  Let me ask you one question. Where is she going to sleep that night?  And another, how's she going to get another job?  Okay, she's apparently getting a reference, but one 'careless' word suggesting she isn't suitable, and that's it as regards another job ""in service"".  Women didn't really work then, so no other jobs to do.  Where does she get money to live on from?  No social security.  She's finished.  That's it.  All over.ANOTHER SPOILER COMING UPThe butler's big secret?  Okay, he went to jail for not fighting in WW1. Doesn't seem like much maybe, but in its time, it's the equivalent of feeling glad about September 11th.  If his employers or co-workers find out, that's it again:  ostracised.This film is packed with layer upon layer of similar stuff.  Maybe it's a bit too real for everyone's taste, but then real people don't worry about finding the Philospher's Stone (good but overlong TV commercial that Harry Potter was) or similar...but they do worry about the issues covered in this film:  jobs, love, peer pressure, social standing, maintaining appearances, unwanted pregnancies, keeping up with the neighbours, bitching about others etc etc etc.Watch it again and, this time, engage brain.",Gosford Park

The story was great with the murder mystery but if the murder would have happened about an hour earlier it might have been an excellent movie. The plot felt waaay too dragged out, and I found myself constantly trying to stay awake throughout. Don't even rent this one.",Gosford Park
341,pingufreak,Don't waste your money,1,19 January 2002,"I just got home from seeing Gosford Park, and I can sum this one up in just a few words.It's a rental for sure.For starters, there were too many characters to keep track of, and not enough reasons to really give a damn about any of them. Granted, it was my first experience watching a Robert Altman film, and knowing that Altman is known for his large ensemble cast movies, I should have expected this. However, Altman being the accomplished film director that he is, I'm sure even Altman could have given me reasons to care about the characters, their backgrounds, their relationships, or anything else. He failed miserably.The only real glimmer of hope in this movie comes in the form of Steven Fry's dim-witted investigator. However, he enters into the mix far too late in the film, and for me, far too late to really garner any interest I might have lost. Maggie Smith manages to slip in the occassional sharp-tongued one-liners, but they are way too few and too far between. Ryan Phillipe was just annoying, plain and simple. Everyone else was your typically stuffy English, save for the equally annoying film producer from California who wouldn't shut up or go away. By the half-way point of the movie, I was wishing he'd be the murder victim. Yes, that's right...the murder doesn't even happen until more than half way through the movie.As a movie, ""Gosford Park"" definitely should rank among the year's worst films. As a cure for insomnia, I highly recommend it.",Gosford Park
342,kubrick09mp,a great movie,10,20 January 2002,"As I was watching Gosford Park for the first time, I got the feeling that I was watching a great film.  Upon second viewing, my suspicions were confirmed.  Altman is a genius at weaving a large cast together, and he definitely delivers with this one.  His methods tend to transcend genres to depict very serious social implications within his subject.  In GP, he turns an Who-done-it flick into a comment on the class structure of England between the wars.  It is an important film in Altman's canon, and deserves comparison to his very best pictures.",Gosford Park
343,strindbergandhelium,Possibly The Worst Movie Going Experience Ever,2,22 January 2002,"This movie moves at a glacial pace, and I think the critics that gave this movie four stars just did so because they didn't want to look stupid.  The funniest part of the film was not what was on screen, but the comments we made about it. This was like a Merchant Ivory MST3K movie going experience.",Gosford Park
344,buscador26,One of Altman's best,9,2 May 2004,"It is unfortunate that yet again Hollywood did not know how to promote Gosford Park.  It is true there is a murder, and that is where similarities to usual murder mysteries ends.  However, Hollywood chose to market this as some sort of P.G. Wodehouse comedy about class morals and etiquette.  I think this a big reason why many people here did not like it, and it's understandable; they were simply led to believe it was going to be a very different film.  Although theres' some funny moments, it is more or less a drama, not a comedy and not even really a murder mystery.I just watched Gosford Park for the first time now, and I know, like a great book, it's going to be a movie I watch again and again.  Like almost all of Altman's movies, we are simply dropped right in the middle of the action from the beginning.  We eavesdrop on seemingly dozens of conversations, so many that the first hour or so is quite a confusing and even frustrating experience.  But then, as in Altman's masterpiece Nashville, the story suddenly snaps together and we realize that this movie isn't about the murder at all (just like Nashville really wasn't just about the country music business), but rather the circumstances and social powers that led to it.Gosford Park is quite a subversive and, at its heart, even angry film.  It is not just an attack on the British class system, or even on class systems in general, but it is also about the hierarchies and judgments all of us constantly make, everyday.  The servants in the movie maintain every bit of the level of gossiping and social hierarchy of the folks upstairs.  True, the class system and terrible treatment of single mothers at the time ultimately leads to the murder, yet the servants are not free of prejudice, either.This is by far one of Altman's most subtle and powerful films.  It is not his greatest, I agree with others that the detective is just too cartoonish and overbearing, and I tired of the ""film within a film"" jokes, which were used brilliantly in The Player, but somehow just didn't seem appropriate here.  In a weird way, I wish it were a tiny bit longer, there was so much left unstated and hanging.  But that is Altman's point, too; our own lives are certainly not neatly folded into plots and subplots that are resolved neatly after two hours, but rather half-remembered conversations, small yet telling gestures or glances, and powerful, truthful moments, such as when one the maids abruptly says that all she really seeks is true love. (Okay, sounds hokey here, but, really, it's a remarkable scene.)  The murdered person in Gosford Park stirs up even more emotions and life-changing moments after he is dead.  And after the movie is over, we can certainly think about the issues it brings up in our own lives.",Gosford Park
345,resto,"pretentious, predictable and boring",3,9 May 2003,"Pretentious, predictable and boring, this is one of Altman's least interesting films. The excellent Richard E.

It takes an active, attentive, inquisitive mind to grasp its value and achievements, and if you're someone who simply wants to be ""amused"" with films, then stay away. It's much too detailed and nuanced for you to appreciate its subtleties, and it will simply bore you.Yes, it's lengthy, but it also takes it time in order to place all of the pieces of the mystery together and make the proper connections between characters. And it can be difficult to understand the dialogue due to the heavy accents and Altman's chaotic, overlapping style, but the work pays off with an emotionally devastating, but satisfying, conclusion.",Gosford Park

The plot is as thin as paper, and for a dramatic murder mystery it's not all that dramatic. If it takes over an hour for the plot of a movie to begin there's got to be something wrongSome one told me it was good, and then I decided to watch it. BIG mistake. After the movie was over, I wanted to go to bed ( it was about 7 o'clock) and sleep until noon so that my eyes could heal from this wretched, drawn on, waiting-for-the-story-to-begin movie.

It IS a complex movie and you do find yourself working hard to keep up with who is who, but even if you can't identify everyone it doesn't really matter. The movie can be enjoyed on so many levels that if you didn't follow the murder plot-line first time around you will have enjoyed the banter, social interactions, satire, pathos, insight into the British class system or any number of other aspect of the piece.A couple of the characters do seem irrelevant, but then then is pretty true to life!Worth every cent and very satisfying on many levels.",Gosford Park

I found this movie, especially, like all his other movies: confusing, boring, slow, and not worth the time it took to watch the movie.

353,stephenawebb,AWESOME ALTMAN!!!,10,21 November 2001,"This film opened the London Film festival and I was lucky enough to see get tickets. Robert Altman was there and so were most of the cast.I've seen over half of the Altman cannon of work and this has to rank up with his best. Set in the 1920's, a group of people get together for a shooting weekend at the estate of Lord and Lady Mcardle. There are two sets of characters, the Toffs upstairs and the servants downstairs.  With his customary multi-streaming overlapping narrative, cross cutting dialogue and interwoven storylines, Altman sets up dynamics within and between the two classes. There are up to 32 speaking parts and each of them is invested with a clear identity. Just from a few lines, a gesture, raising of an eyebrow, we have an idea of a character's feelings and motivations.At times the narrative moves at such a fast pace, but we never lose track of whats going on. Scenes such as the Toffs in the Drawing room having tea - many conversations happening, dynamics being set up - and another where the servants are rushing around downstairs, as the camera weeves its way through the corridors, are exhilirating cinema!!  Altman has a tight grip on the proceedings and this only wavers slightly towards the end.There is a fantastic scene, where Ivor Novello - a guest, is invited to sing for the other guests and all the servants listen covertly from whatever vanatge point they can find. Novello oustays his welcome, amongst the gentry, but the servants cant get enough.What Altman has done here, helped enormously by the wonderfully humourous script by Julian Fellows, is invested these period characters with a modern sensibility. These are not the boring, stuffed dummy museum pieces of your typical period picture, these people are real. Rich or poor, their fallibilities, desires, disaffections and frustrations are evidently clear. This movie is so good, I wanted to get up and cheer at certain points. Altman is well served by the 'creme de la creme' of British Actors. All are excellent; Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Jeremy Northam to name a few. This film may not be everyones cup of tea and i am someone who can go watch anything from Scream 3 to the latest hot film from Asia, but those that invest the time on this film, will be much rewarded.  Altman deserves the Oscar that has eluded him for far too long.",Gosford Park

Terrible movie...boring and slow.  How anybody could say this is a great movie is beyond me.  I think Agatha Christie would be insulted that this movie was compared to her works.  This is just an example of how a name in Hollywood translates into what is supposed to be a critically acclaimed movie.  Don't rent it, and don't even watch it on cable.

Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren once again show why they are considered great actresses but the whole cast makes the movie one of the best reunion of actors. Forget the stars in ""Ocean's Eleven"", Gosford Park's actors are the REAL best group! In fact, Altman seems to know that his whole movie depends on the characters and so he casted only the best (even the pitifull Ryan Phillip seems to be a real actor in this movie!).

The sets are great, the performances are fine (Maggie Smith in particular) but there's a definite lack of focus here.

I stared directly at the screen for most of the time. Still, I can't tell you what happened. All I know is that somebody killed Dumbledore and Oscar Wilde showed up to solve the crime.that actually would have been a much better movie.in most movies like this, the murder comes somewhere around the end of the first act. instead, we have to endure rich English-types being snobs and the waitstaff gossiping as they wash plates for nearly 1.5 hours. then, there was some ""amusement"" when one waiter got back at somebody by intentionally dropping coffee in their lap.i lived in the UK for a brief period of time and can decipher various accents, but since the dialogue overlaps and is drowned out by other noise, it doesn't exactly help. what's the point in having a murder-mystery if you aren't at least going to let the audience figure out enough of what's going on so they can at least feel like they've engaged themselves with the story? i figure that most people who actually enjoy this movie are the same people who are on the lookout for ultra-trendy activities to impress their friends with (such as those who went out and stocked up on Pinot Noir after Sideways) and probably all went out to dinner murder/mystery parties after they saw this movie.",Gosford Park

The added murder mystery element is sub to the whole, and a bit of a comic element along the lines of Clouseau in execution. If they did not intend the inspector to be bumbling, they greatly bumbled, because he certainly was. This requires multiple viewings for its multiple layers. Clearly a well done film for its type and subject, a follower to some (Upstairs Downstairs) and precursor to others, such as Abbey. There is much on this posting to give the technical mumbo jumbo should you be interested in that. The film takes the current day license with portrayal of lower forms of human dealings and communication, and is pretty cynical. One catches glimpses of the upper side of the human heart nevertheless. Again, it requires multiple viewings.",Gosford Park
366,lorena007,Terriic - one word,8,3 February 2012,"Violence, mystery, sex, and murder, Gosford Park has it all. Director Robert Altman once again takes the Hollywood formula and gives a unique twist. The story begins when aristocrats during 1932 gather at Sir William McCordle's (Michael Gambon) estate for a shooting party. The guests are wealthy people with their trusty servants. People arrive at the McCordle estate two by two and the traditions begin. The servants set up dinner for their masters and the aristocrats begin their personal routines.The story moves on as the characters begin to establish their names and the audience learns their varying social status. The intertwining stories among the guests begin to surface and the audience begins to realize there is much more in this house than what meets the eye.During the night one member of the elite group is killed. None of the guests seemed to be fazed by this event and are only upset by the inconvenience it sets up for their lives.The only one troubled is Constance, Countess of Trentham's maid, Mary (Kelly McDonald). The story begins to focus on Mary, who discovers secrets among the visitors and leads the audience to solve the mystery.The great aspect about this film is Robert Altman's abilities to bring the past to life. He pays excellent attention to detail and is able to recreate the feelings and morals during the time period. He emerges the audience into a film world filled with history and story. Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters. His fluid camera movements visually portray foreshadowing and relationship among characters. These elements give the audience a complete understanding of the mood and atmosphere in the film.I recommend this movie to anybody who has the patience to sit and focus on this excellent film. Although the beginning is appropriately slow moving and the characters names are difficult to remember, the payoff is worth the efforts.

Of course, there were a few enjoyable films and even masterpieces, Altman's Gosford Park is stuck between the category of masterpiece and great work. This films is interesting from the very beginning till the end, while I was watching the film, I almost never cared for who was the murderer because it was so much fun watching the characters invented by Altman. If I was in a party, my guests would be the Gosford Park ones for sure, it even includes Ivor Novello, the star who's most famous role was in the silent Hitchcock masterpiece ""The Lodger"". This film received the Academy Award for best screenplay (in the same year as Mulholland Drive), the plot was classical, but it still held my attention and even made me laugh throughout the 2h11m. The dialogs and the characters (that I've already mentioned) were very good and the adaptations by the actors were great too, not to mention the photography that I enjoyed a lot. For anyone who has seen Luis Buñuel ""Exterminating Angel"" before, will find some similarities, they both showed a dark side of the high society, but Gosford Park a even more degrading one, yet, still humorous.

I like the British,but this movie was just too British for me to be able to relate to it.Not that thats the main problem,thats just a cliff note of everything.

369,slugermanuk,Classy 'Whodunnit' with a superb cast,9,31 October 2018,"This is a film for connoisseurs. It has probably the finest British cast ever assembled, a witty, sharp script by Julian Fellowes, and masterful direction from the legendary Robert Altman. Ostensibly a whodunnit/detective story set in a stately home in England, the film is more a portrayal of the class system operating on an upstairs downstairs basis, where each group needs the other: even though the fact is not immediately recognised. It is set pre World War II, which would in its aftermath completely blow away the established master & servant hierarchies. There are many clues scattered in the first half of the film before the murder; with the appropriate red herrings, par for the course in a murder mystery, and the viewer needs to pay attention to what is happening on screen - there are often several strands of dialogue going on at the same time, some of which are key to the plot.It is difficult to pick out exceptional roles amongst such an array, but Maggie Smith has most of the wonderfully cutting lines - the precursor (as indeed is the whole film) to Downton Abbey. Helen Mirren as the housekeeper is the epitome of English reserve and icy efficiency - for most of the film. Small wonder that these two received Oscar nominations. Not to mention superb performances from Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates and Derek Jacobi downstairs, and Kristin Scott-Thomas, Charles Dance, and Michael Gambon upstairs. The pacing goes slightly awry when Stephen Fry as the somewhat bumbling detective arrives on the scene with his much smarter constable played by Ron Webster - there is very little deep investigative questioning going on as you would find in an Agatha Christie, but that is hardly the point of the film. The songs in the film are performed by Jeremy Northam playing the actor/composer Ivor Novello, the only actual historical character in the movie, and the songs add to the very realistic 30s atmosphere.",Gosford Park

Just when you think that things are going to get interesting, it doesn't. It just dredges on for another hour. You can guess the plot almost immediately as clues are served so there won't be any real surprise in the end. There are too many characters and very little effort is made in bringing out any of them properly. The dialogue was mundane and the accent/sound recording was so bad that you couldn't make out what they were saying, half the time. This is not a murder mystery.

I agree with others who have mentioned poor sound quality. It was hard to hear the voices when the background sounds were so loud! (and I am not hearing impaired).  Like several others who have posted here, I ended up turning on the subtitles. I have had to use subtitles before with a few British films (Those with what I suppose to be 'lower class accents,' namely in ""Little Voice"" and ""The Full Monty."" However, I have never previously used subtitles with Merchant Ivory films or others depicting the upper class.)  Strange. Anyway, I also agree that there were too many characters to keep straight.  Even at the end, I was trying to connect the names with the faces and sort out their relationships.  (Having the subtitles on probably made this worse as I was paying more attention to the words rather than what was shown on-screen.)  I disagree with those who have said that the mystery is not solved at the end...the 2 parties are accused and both are guilty!  I think I would have gotten even more out of this film if I would have viewed it again, but I don't have the patience to do that. Afterwards, we watched the ""Deleted Scenes"" with Altman's commentary on why they were deleted.  Time after time, Altman said that various scenes were deleted because they were not necessary to the plot, or that the point had been explained elsewhere.  I disagree.  With as many characters as there were, I think that reinforcing a few points would have made the film easier to follow.  Overall 7/10.  I am thinking about down-grading to a 6/10.",Gosford Park

The only mystery is how anyone paid money to see this.",Gosford Park
375,philip.levy,This movie is working on multiple levels,8,20 August 2004,"For roughly the first two thirds of this movie, I found it slow. The acting was good, but the contrast between the upstairs aristocracy and the servants below seemed a bit obvious and the plot didn't seem to be going anywhere interesting. Then it began to dawn on me that there was much more going on. I'll just touch on one interesting point (SPOILERS BELOW). The Emily Watson character, in the bath, says, ""Why is it all about them?"" She's referring to the aristocracy and how the servants get their vicarious enjoyment through them. Yet the whole point is that it was NOT all about them. The employers are often begging their servants to hear the gossip. The employers are the ones who must sit respectfully while music is playing; the servants get to dance. And, ultimately, one of the aristocrats is murdered because of the affairs of the servants. It's a particularly nice touch that the Kristen Scott Thomas character is only dimly aware that such affairs are going on and dismisses them as irrelevant, even after they have just turned her life upside down. The movie came together in a way I found very satisfying. As others have said, it is NOT about the murder mystery. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but I'm anxious to watch it again.",Gosford Park
376,sparkyhisel,Superb! But not really a murder-mystery.,8,12 February 2002,"This was a great movie.  But it's not everybody's cup of tea.  The tag line ""Tea at four. Dinner at eight. Murder at midnight."" might make some think they are in for a fun murder-mystery. But this isn't really a who-dun-it. It's more like a backstage pass to the Clue mansion.If this movie doesn't do well, it will be because people went in expecting Clue and found something different.The upstairs-downstairs dynamic was intriguing. The whole setup made me evaluate the way we humans conduct our affairs. This film's not just for fun; it's a little bit of a thinking movie, too. But it's by no means dull; I laughed a lot.The characters are good. It can be a little hard to keep everyone straight at first (make sure you can hear it well; I saw it in a theater with a whacked out sound system and it was very frustrating). But once you settle into in, the characters are very rewarding. The actors all did a good job. Lots of fresh faces and many known ones.Kelly Macdonald, as Mary the maid we spent so much time with, was very sweet without being saccharine. And, hello Clive Owen as Parks the valet; he rocked. He was friendly, handsome, wise, and he played barely-reigned-in without being manic.It was interesting (although frustrating) to see the excellent Jeremy Northam in a smaller roll. I think this was the first time I've ever liked Derek Jacobi in a movie. Helen Mirren as the housekeeper was a steady hand. Richard E. Grant as George the first footman was had several stingingly funny moments.",Gosford Park
377,jwpen,Confused and baffled,6,10 January 2002,"I enjoyed Gosford Park but could not understand much of the dialogue and could not differentiate the characters. Too many characters looked alike and had similar mannerisms.I did not know one woman was the daughter until I checked the credits later. I have no idea which character she was. I could not tell the difference between the two older female servants. Who were the two younger men who sped off near the end? Who was jazing the female servant downstairs? Who was married to whom? Who was the short English guy?I had no such problem following the characters in my two favorite Altman films, Nashville and A Wedding.I had been warned not to try to understand, but just enjoy, that even Altman could not explain what was going on.

Not only has he not ""lost"" it - he's back - perhaps better than ever. Everything about this movie is top-notch. The ensemble cast is impeccable & every member is required to do extraordinary work. Nobody could be removed without altering the uniquely organic fabric Altman weaves between the different classes, genders, and families. The intricate, dense screenplay by Julian Fellowes provides a clean and precise roadmap and disciplines Altman's improvisatory technique to follow stricter period guidelines. However, the passion, intensity, and spontaneity are still very much there.

Like the Coen brothers, Altman creates a distinct universe for his story, the only place where this story could possibly unfold. Each character lives in each word they say, which is fortunate because, with this large ensemble, no one gets a great deal of screen time. Perfectly cast and artfully directed. Altman's camera meanders through the huge English mansion, pausing on bottle of poison, tables full of knives, and cases of guns to foreshadow the inevitable foul play. The conclusion (and the revelation of the culprit) come along so smoothly that, when they both arrive, one is left with that satisfying combination of surprise and inevitability. ""Well, of course that's what happened. I should have known all along."" By the way, don't worry if the you get a little lost in the flurry of characters and stories that get introduced in the beginning. It all sorts itself out in the end.",Gosford Park

The people are extremely boring including the dialogue. You don't even care to find out who the killer is.Talking about the murder, it takes to long for it to even happen, and it wasn't even exciting at all, it was just plain.  You don't even see the person being killed, you just see the body slump over.Even though critics seem to really enjoy this film, and users seem to give it a nice number.  It really isn't all that great.  I like movies that have hardly any action  (having action doesn't always mean big explosions and fighting) if the people are interesting.

382,dlscally,The dialogue did not cross the Atlantic successfully.,2,28 January 2002,"Why do modern British movie makers insist that their actors employ dialects that cannot be understood on this side of the Atlantic? There was a huge cast of about 30 major parts, some played by very famous actors.  What most of them had in common was their speech delivery, a combination of mumbling and slurred speech that was impossible to follow even with the theatre microphones turned up to a painfully loud volume. As is typical of the modern British movie, the first 20 minutes failed to grab my attention and failed to clarify plot development. Most of the story was told in narrative fragments inserted throughout the movie, with very little important action taking place on screen. Because the dialogue was not understandable on this side of the Atlantic, or at least by me, I could not follow the plot.
There are occasional recent British made movies that can be understood on this side of the Atlantic, but they are the exception. It is even rarer to find a recent British movie that grabs the viewer's attention at the start as the 1947 ""Great Expectations"" with John Mills and Hitchcock's 1940""Rebecca"" do. The introduction of the DVD with English subtitles partially solves the first problem, but it can do little to to get the story going.",Gosford Park

A bunch of snobs discussing things together in an English countryside house. Wow what an exciting topic to make a movie about. Something only a director as boring as Robert Altman could conjure up. None of the characters are interesting or have even the remotest of charisma. Why is this even called a murder mystery? even the murder scene was boring. I talked to someone who went to the cinema to see this when it first opened, they said that almost the entire cinema had fallen asleep or were amusing themselves by throwing popcorn around by the ending of this slop heap. I couldn't stomach anymore of the lame costumes and pathetically inept dialogue and had to switch it off. The characters are just so shallow and it's no wonder why so many people on these comments call this boring too. The snobbish sheep who preach that we didn't get it are mistaken.",Gosford Park

But where I was expecting a thrilling story, I got to see a slowly moving painting which didn't show much interesting. No action at all, but a more than extended view of how people had dinner in those times...interesting for 5mins, not for more then 2hrs.Another example: the inspector who was investigating the murder. He was the only character that almost made me laugh, while this movie is supposed to be pretty serious. His role completely mismatched with the rest of the setting the 'plot' was developing into and made the whole part looking' cheap.

This superb film is flawlessly acted and beautifully shot. Altman must feel that his vision for this film was fully realized.It did not bother me at all that the film really needs to be seen twice, the second time to find every clever detail, and for us Yanks to ""get"" every bit of dialogue.The film requires incredible concentration....which probably accounts for the under-50s crowd wondering what the fuss was about.",Gosford Park

Unlike in an Agatha Christie the murder was at least done by a main member of the cast,and clues weren't left out until after you have found out who dunit. I thought the ensemble cast was in the main very good especially Maggie Smith's cutting wit. Robert Altman has made a truly superb film about life in a 1930's country house house with all the upstairs/downstairs prejudices and snobbery.The first hour is mainly taken up by perfectly paced character development.Then the murder happens and the guessing begins. I particually liked the Clive Owen character (Parks) an ambiguous and dark character with more skeletons then most and not all in his own cupboard.One last thing,it was a joy to hear real english and scottish accents rather than the sterile ""HOLLYWOOD"" version that we hear all to often.I cannot understand the compliants about not being able to understand the dialog in this film(nobody on this side of the pond ever seem to have any problems with American accents unless they are speaking spanish of course!!).",Gosford Park

Many of the performances are superb, yet one can't help but compare it to another similar picture in the same genre. THE MANOR done a couple of years earlier is more unique, with a more interesting plot, over all better acting and casting and is without question, much more beautifully shot.

394,tidwell85,We shall never find that lovely land of might-have-been.,9,6 September 2015,"Jeremy Northam's voice instantly hypnotizes the cooks, maids, and footmen at Gosford Park. He lifts their spirits, they forget themselves, and for a moment all work ceases. The irony here is that because they're so entranced they fail to grasp the song's meaning, which is about hopeless longing and dreams unfulfilled. It puts smiles on their faces anyway, but has no effect at all on the upstairs guests, who spend so much energy posturing that they can't seem to recognize the value of any of the many graces offered to them. The downstairs staff certainly appreciates the entertainment, since they toil day and night over details like the distance between the knife and the fork, and whether strawberry marmalade will suffice when the raspberry jam runs out. 'The perfect servant has no life,' declares Mrs. Wilson, and while her pride is admirable, her sacrifice is tragic. What a shame, giving all of your time away to dote on people who don't themselves seem to know how to live, either.The super wealthy can't be entirely blamed for their plight, which I think stems from loneliness. People tend to behave oddly around the rich and famous—they get nervous, begin putting on an act, or trying so hard not to that they clam up. Like a highway patrol cop in traffic, the presence of esteem inspires everyone close by to alter their behavior. It makes sense then that the rich prefer to surround themselves with hired help who are paid to behave respectfully rather than go out into the world and live their lives in public. Their wealth affords them the illusion of a public life in a private and controlled setting. The danger is that after spending years dealing primarily with one's own servants, one might become incapable of dealing with anyone else even, say, an inspector who needs help solving a murder.Consider the inspector's interactions with the guests. They treat him like the pizza delivery guy. They talk at him flippantly, begrudge him a moment for questioning, and fail to summon a shred of helpful information. This apparent insubordination is more out of apathy than defiance, and the inspector isn't blameless either. He treats witnesses with kid gloves, allows himself to be interrupted but never himself interrupts. I imagine that he would have more vigorously interrogated potential witnesses had the murder occurred in a poor or middle class district, but he behaves submissively when dealing with the guests at Gosford Park.Attending a shooting party like this one is an exercise in straddling that line between intent and image. Image obscures intent, so it must be hard, being a wealthy host, to trust whether guests are attending out of true friendship. We, the audience, can certainly be sure that they are not because of the film's fly on the wall point of view. We quickly become aware of their disparate natures, that they only harmonize in their collective effort to remain in the good graces of Sir William. To open up to each other is to risk exposure or embarrassment, so distance is crucial to maintain a safe proximity. These aren't friends; these are satellites in tow. I makes sense, then, that when Sir William is killed and an inspector starts asking questions, no investigative headway is made. This is because as far as the guests are concerned, with Sir William gone there is no longer any need to engage. It's time to float away, like debris in outer space.The idea of behavior obscuring motive is relatively foreign to Americans. I recently hosted an English traveler who needed a couch to crash on, and he told me that in English culture, protocol of behavior is of the utmost importance. ""We can enslave entire cultures, but we'll do it with a stiff upper lip, while we have our afternoon tea,"" he said. I believe Americans tend to flaunt our motives more overtly, embody them. It's seen as a sign of virtue when a salesman embodies salesmanship, an athlete competition, a computer whiz nerd-dom. I feel (and this is pure conjecture) that to embody 'good manners' is valued but not to the degree that it is in Europe, particularly England. In America, we are almost suspicious of those whose intentions aren't clear. Consider the way characters in reality shows interact. Their behavior is motivated by primordial urges—chiefly, the urge to impose their personality. The line 'I'm not here to make friends' seems to be a reoccurring catchphrase. Gosford Park operates by almost opposing values: America's brand of 'reality' is best concealed so that the surface always appears squeaky clean. I would guess that even a non-English speaker, having spent a weekend with the casts of any of the new 'real world' shows, would walk away with a pretty good understanding of who those people are simply because the personalities are so unabashed. Yet I feel as though a fellow English speaker, even a thoughtful and aware individual, could spend a weekend at Gosford Park and walk away thinking only of how charming the affair was, but having no clue as to what was really going on.Despite all of this I can't agree with the film's outlook, an outlook I would call altogether cynical. The alternative to the lifestyle of affluence is a lifestyle of needs-based living. For years I lived minimally, considering excess a burden and ambition a form of avarice, and you know maybe I wasn't wrong. But if we must rise with each new day, I don't see the harm in striving for some form of highness, even if illusory, as long as an attempt is made towards balance. This film is about the imbalance, the extremity of Postbellum English aristocracy. It emphasizes the evils and the folly that wealth and servitude cause without acknowledging that wealth is simply the end result of something inherently good. It doesn't express the reality that if we didn't posture whatsoever, we would be left crawling.",Gosford Park

I have seen it about five times now, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I think the British actors all turned in terrific performances, but Ryan Phillipe was just dead-weight. Unfortunately, every scene he is in falls flat or has a seriously sour note. In my opinion, he tries to hard to inject a sex appeal that is ill-suited to him. Far better is the understated acting by the British actors, who nail the nuances of their characters' personalities every time. Maggie Smith is a joy to watch, as is Jeremy Northam, and who knew he could sing! Kristin Scott Thomas' icy performance perfectly captures her character's mood. This is definitely the role she was made for. The comic relief provided by Stephen Fry is well worth waiting for as well. Despite the previous accolades, however, I cannot help but feel that the film is missing something. The camera work is very good, but there is always a sense that there is something lurking off to the side. But, this could be the whole point, that someone is always watching.

Fry seems to think he's in a kind of music hall gag, where he plays a caricature of a bumbling police inspector, half Clouseau and half English class distinction (milk into teacup after, not before, tea), and keeps reminding everyone of his name, as a tired joke. Watching performers such as Maggie Smith, or the excellent Eileen Atkins, as well as many other distinguished members of the cast, is always rewarding, but Fry's appearances are best glossed over as quickly as possible, as they reduce the film's quality.

401,DocKatz,Review Part I (Many Spoilers),2,1 March 2002,"From my brother, who evidently was quite irked by the film.  Many spoilers below...Gosford ParkFinally, a murder mystery completely devoid of intrigue, suspense or interest!It's about time somebody bad-mouthed this three-hour parade of ennui.Memo to the Academy:   You you really, really blew it this time.  Was it not enough to give Robert Altman a best director nod?  Did you have to follow the critics down their misguided path as well?Where to begin?  Well, let's start with the obvious  the film itself. Amazingly boring; intensely uninteresting.  The theory here is `if we put enough characters on the screen maybe no one will notice that NOT A SINGLE ONE IS WORTH STUDYING'.  Robert Altman has done this in several films.  Did you not notice?  Short Cuts immediately comes to mind.  In Short Cuts, Altman wove together thirty characters in four or five dull stories hoping that no one would notice that no single story could stand on it's own. Critics were fooled; audiences were not.There are forty-five (45!) speaking roles in Gosford Park.  For anybody who liked this film, can you tell me honestly: 1. was there a single line of memorable dialogue?  2.  was there a character with whom you could spend more than five minutes and not be bored?  3.  was there a tension between any two characters great enough to explore beyond the movie's parameters? (i.e. would you care to see any of these characters interact again, ever? Did you want to follow Elsie's life in London?  Really?  Why?)The plot of the first two hours comes down to two story lines: what shirt will Maggie `I'm only going to open my mouth to be abusive' Smith wear to not go hunting?  And is Ryan `Do you know how hard it is to be Max Perlich from Maverick?' Phillippe really a valet?  The answer to both questions: `who cares?'This is the first film I'd ever seen in which there was hidden sex, only to find out that when we knew who was engaged in the sex, I'd rather it had stayed hidden.How do you sell this thing to an outsider?`Gosford Park is a murder mystery.' `OK, whodunit?' `The film isn't clear on that point, nor does it want to be.  The why is given, but almost no one seems to care about the whom, including the inspector.  Neither is there resolution of the crime.  There are also far too many suspects.' `So, uh, it isn't really a murder mystery.' `No.' `So, what's it about, then?' `Well, a cast of dozens, literally, goes to this big English country house for a hunting party.  It's set in the 1932.' `Why 1932?' `Theory is that it was a time of marked decline in the English empire; but such seems irrelevant.  It could have been 1732,1832 or 1992, and you'd get the same result.' `Is it about this hunting stuff?' `Not especially.  At it's core, it's about servant-master relationships.' `So, there a lot of servant-master issues going on, right?' `Sort of.  You see, while it should be about such, the servants almost all in unison get down on this one American who is playing the part of a servant without being onethey obviously take pride rather than scorn at their positions.  It's an English thing.' `Ah, so we put down Americans, then.  Is it funny?' `No, not really.  There's some comic relief about a Hollywood producer of Charlie Chan films, but it doesn't really work.  There also open scorn of a notable Hollywood actor, but as the servants to a person are smitten with him, that doesn't really work either.' `The murderee deserves it, right?' `Oh, he sure does.' `So, the crime is worth the admission.' `No, it's kind of anticlimactic, too.  The violent portion is an attack on a corpse.  Also, while one can sympathize with the murder; it's hard to sympathize with any single character.  You'd have to see it to understand.' `And why would I do that? `I have no idea.'The minute I can make my own films, this English quiet-underlying tension scam tripe will be my first effort.  If these are the standards, how hard can it be to make a winner?Look, I know you think I'm joking here, but try this treatment:  English castle, 1880s.  Why the 1880s?  It doesn't matter; it's all English history, therefore it was all worthy of note, apparently.  There's a love triangle between the Duke or Baron or whatever, a Noble Lady of some sort and a stable hand.  Now, meanwhile, there's some sort of conflict involving either the legitimacy of the Duke's title or the rightful owners of the Castle  some sort of German royalty who have returned post marriage to reclaim an English title.  Throw in some looks at parliament, some big foofy dresses and about ten random servant characters with various stances on how they feel about royalty and you've got yourself a movie.Do you see how easy it is?  That was off the top of my head, and yet snotty English folk and Anglophiles would line up around the block to see it.BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY GOOD.  And while the plot I described is three times more involving than Gosford Park, that doesn't make it worth seeing, either.   Not without something on screen that doesn't bore you, at least.",Gosford Park
402,DocKatz,Review Part II (More Spoilers),2,1 March 2002,"Part II of the review from my brother, still quite irked.  More spoilers below...
This film is well over two hours long.  That's quite a time for nothing to happen or intrigue the mind.  Look, I don't need an action film here, but even Merchant-Ivory films have some tense undercurrents that one can relate to.  This is the first film since Accidental Tourist in which, in retrospect, I'd wished I'd slept through.  (And that includes Pearl Harbor).Now the big question, voters: why did you nominate this film for best picture?  You know that there are standards involved here.   What were you people thinking?  Let me guess.  The critics loved it.  That they did. Why? Who can say?  Robert Altman has become the Bob Dylan of movies:  if you're a rebel long enough, apparently, you turn into an icon.  It doesn't make your crap any better, it just makes it `legitimate'.  Do something remotely mainstream, and people hurl awards at you, like Clint Eastwood for Unforgiven.  The English loved it.  Well, of course they did, but is that an excuse?  There's servants, there's masters, there's random English history, there's put downs of Americans and American culture.  What more would an Englishman want?The selection of Gosford Park for Best Picture represents the absolute worst of such selections: overlong, over involved and yet curiously standoffish and without tension, stuffy, set in another era for no apparent reason. It's like this garbage contains all of the nominated clichés, without any of the things that make Best Pictures worth the nomination.You don't seem to realize the implications here  every year, generally, there are about one to three truly outstanding pictures to fill five Best Picture slots.  (Last year there were zero, but that's another story.) Take this year for example:  the odds that either Lord of the Rings or Beautiful Mind will take Best Picture are about 95%.  After that, it's a matter of taste.  The remaining three fill two purposes: 1.  They give that Chariots of Fire hope to films that should be just happy for the nomination, but more importantly, 2. they send a message from Academy to Hollywood that tells what kind of films we'd like to see more often.Last year was a perfect case in point  Traffic and Gladiator were considered the heavys.  Erin Brockovich, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Chocolat were fillers.  Not a single one of the five was a great film, which only further illustrates the point that such is a forum for voters to send messages to Hollywood.  Erin Brockovich, the blandest offering, was clearly the benchmark here.  This film was not even Steven Soderbergh's best work of 2000; it stood no chance of getting the Best Picture award.  But do you see the statement it makes?  There were several other films in the Brockovich category: good, not great  Cast Away, Almost Famous, You Can Count on Me, O Brother Where Art Thou?, Wonder Boys.   Even now, if you made the claim that any one of these was the actual nominee, only the `Beat the Geeks' movie guy will call you on it.  What do you get out of Erin Brockovich?  Well, you make the statement that you'd like to see stronger women's roles, more David v. Goliath stories and more happy endings in Hollywood.  You see how that works?This was a down year for film.  That all is very clear.  But that doesn't make this right; there were other choices.  You picked Moulin Rouge!, a pick that makes the disturbing statement that John Leguizamo actually contributed to a Best Picture nominee.  The direction was all over the map and the cuts were relentless, but at least that film was something new.   Look at the other available choices: Memento, The Royal Tenenbaums, Amelie.  These all received writing nominations, so you guys obviously liked them.  Think of what a far superior statement you make in giving one of these films the nod. You don't have to go for the obvious also-rans either.  You could have selected the insipid Shrek, or Waking Life, a film just about 1,000 times more fascinating than Gosford Park.You didn't have to go obvious and you didn't have to appease Robert Altman with anything more than an undeserved Best Director nomination.Even if you loved it,you must admit Gosford Park is clearly the blandest Best Picture of 2001; the Erin Brockovich of the 74th awards.  So what message are you sending here?  `We want more movies with dozens of amorphous characters, little plot and only underlying screen tension, but no real conflict.'  What a message.  Shame on you.Look, IT IS OK TO HATE THIS FILM.  It wasn't that good.  You don't have to give in to the English or critics.Oh, and the choices of Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren for nominations couldn't be less inspired, but that's another issue.One star.",Gosford Park

There are few likable characters.  This movie tried to be too many things and succeeded in being only one thing.

If Agatha Christie could have seen this, I'm sure she would have smiled. How do you pick out, in a cast of 30 or so superb performances, the ones that make a movie? There's Michael Gambon as the insatiably procreative and amoral host, so well matched to a role compared to his casting as Dumbledore. Kelly Macdonald embodying the spirit of a Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot in her understated performance as the unraveler of mysteries. Maggie Smith offering a clipped opinion about everything and everyone with so much humorously eloquent attitude, arguably the only upstairs dweller who seems to realize that the servants do exist and do hear what you say. Richard E. Grant as the man of vices and magnificently opinionated looks and gestures. Helen Mirren as the servant and mother who, true to her ""calling,"" anticipates every need. And on and on and on, I kid you not. What a great movie. To pull off something this complex must have given Altman an incredible artistic high. This is a must-see movie.",Gosford Park

Well, for those Americans who rushes here and there never knowing how to appreciate the slowness of life should not see this movie Well, I did fall sleep a couple of times too watching this movie, but so what, I think it is totally alright to nap bit watching a great movie, just like being quiet to a true friend, with who you don¡¯t need pretend witty hyper and all.",Gosford Park

412,KentWang,"Scattered and shallow story, superb direction",6,31 March 2003,"Plot: boring and obvious. There's an old screenwriter's adage that if someone gets shot in Act 3, show the rifle on the mantle in Act 1. This film follows this to a T but posts giant neon signs around said rifle. The viewer should be insulted by the director's low expectations of his intelligence.The plot also greatly suffers from very shallow character development, simply because there were too many of them. Pulp Fiction only had four characters and Magnolia had three hours of screentime. This film tries to develop 15 characters in 2 hours and fails utterly. I'll grant that it was done efficiently, but this was simply an impossible goal given the resources.There are a few more glaring flaws with the screenplay, but I'll give it a rest. The direction, sets, costumes, mood and soundtrack were all superb though. And the acting well above average fare, even by British standards, especially Maggie Smith.",Gosford Park
413,jnr126,I would like to know who nominated this for Best Picture,6,19 June 2002,"I went into a screening of this film with very high hopes for a quality movie.  I mean it was nominated for Best Picture for goodness sakes...I couldn't have been more wrong. First of all this movie should inform the viewer that a notebook is a necessity in watching this film.  I sat through a 2 and half hour movie and I could not tell you ONE characters name. The plot sounded simple enough but I thought it was one with potential.  I was under the impression that it was a ""Clue"" type murder mystery.  But how can one expect a viewer to care about ""who done it"" when none of the characters seemed to care at all about it.  They just went on about their daily lives without a care in the world. I saw this movie far too long ago to go into any great detail about the plot and what not but overall I was unimpressed.",Gosford Park
414,cec29,A star filled cast does not make a star filled movie,6,16 January 2002,"With so many well known actors in Gosford Park (including Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Ryan Phillipe, Jeremy Northam, Derek Jacobi, and Kristin Scott Thomas), one might think there is no way to go wrong.  However, the casting seems only to serve in drawing in audiences to a movie that might otherwise be overlooked as another stodgy British film.  In fact, after watching the murder mystery I came to the conclusion that the large cast hurt the film more than helped.  There are so many characters with so many different problems and gripes, that none of them, in the end, seem important.  We are never allowed to get to know anyone, not even the supposed protagonist in the film, a maid in training who solves the whole murder herself.Therein lies another criticism of the film, the plot.  My viewing companion expressed an expectation that the story would be like Twelve Little Indians, or Murder on the Orient Express.  Though the body count remained as low as that in Murder on the Orient Express, none of Agatha Christie-like wit embodied itself in Gosford Park.  The movie reveals the murderer's identity so easily that such a long and tedious movie seems superfluous.  The explanation behind the murder could have been written in a paragraph and I would have gotten as much out of it.The best part of the film is the visuals and by this, I mean both animate and inanimate.  The house and land on which it is filmed is the epitome of British upper-class living.  The 1932 costumes and the lavishly set tables are all very beautiful.  Some of the actors ain't bad to look at either. But somehow, this doesn't matter when there are other such comparable films with better stories.",Gosford Park

Still, I was curious what will differentiate it from ""Brideshead ..."", from Agatha Christie's ones (as I heard a murder will happen). Extremely interesting and surprising for me about this film was the fact that while the American director Weissman seemed to predict what will happen, later sarcastically describing the details on the phone for his crew in Hollywood, the reality (the underground) proved to be far beyond his remarks or anyone's guesses. So, the screenplay is indeed remarkable ...And I think it is worth adding my husband's remarks, first on the image - it was like shooting after Magritte, second - memories from the ""Remains of the day"" came back from past, especially about the perfectionism of the English servant and his/hers squeezed interior life.It was such a tremendous experience to watch this movie ...",Gosford Park

Dialogue is supposed to get you somewhere.  Movies are supposed to have suspense and drama and foreshadowing.  I gave up trying to figure out the names and relationships in this movie in the first 20 minutes--there were too many people, too many inter-relationships, and none of it vaguely interesting.  The humorous parts were only humorous as a relief from the doldrums.  Even the murder itself and the discovery of the murder were uninteresting.If you like Scottish, Irish, and English accents and people dressed up in period outifts, you will love this movie.

418,fotofilm,A fun trip to the past,8,22 December 2006,"For me, the movie has been a fun trip to old England. Everything feels somewhat authentic to what it was in Britain in early 1900s, at least for me (but I'm not an expert, I'm not even British :) ). The setting was a gathering of some of British elites, where some wealthy men and women came to a fellow rich man's mansion to go hunting for a few days. In the interactions among these people, the filmmaker's showing us how these 'lords' and 'ladies' think and live their lives. And since it's their servants that for most part make them 'lords' and 'ladies'; the servants are important parts of their lives. And the servants are important parts of this movie as well. The 'lords' and 'ladies' have their own world and so do the servants. And sometimes the two worlds intertwine, naturally some might say. All in all, the movie mocks the class system in those days, and I enjoy watching it. The characters are rich in variety. Some are charming, some are selfish, and some are very boring. But every one of them makes the movie works. The acting is fantastic. One thing that I somewhat regret is that the filmmaker did this gathering setting (which means it involves many many characters) so 'real' (the filmmaker didn't do much effort to introduce the characters in order to let the movie flows very naturally. And he succeeded), that it's quite hard to know every one of them. I had two or three characters that I could only guessed ""who's who"". Some words of caution, if you look for a story, you may be left wanting, especially in the end. For me, the movie gives a setting rather than a story. And it's perfectly fine for me. It's a good movie.",Gosford Park

422,cinderella_chick22,This movie fails to meet my expectations,1,28 July 2002,"I do not recommend Gosford Park to anyone. Perhaps if Alfred Hitchcock had written and directed it, the movie would have been great. Gosford Park resembles a soap opera in that it has a large cast list. Also most of the movie is spent watching the cast sit around and talk to each other. All the action in the movie is downplayed. I saw the movie thinking it was a murder mystery comedy film. I watched the first hour wondering what the plot was. The cast is so large there isn't time to develop any characters fully. This movie would have worked better if it had used suspense. As Hitchcock once said, ""You can have two people sitting at a table discussing baseball, or you can show that there is a bomb under the table as the guys talk. Without the viewer's knowledge of the bomb, it would just be two people talking about baseball."" This sums up how dry this movie truly is.",Gosford Park

We quickly find that this is not the point of this piece. There is no spin, no twists, no surprises, and nothing that we have not seen before...actually the best word to describe it would be ""ordinary."" However, a great cast, and the masterful way that Altman is always able to directs an ensemble of this size is the high point.

Altman makes a stunning comeback in this whodunit set in an English country house in 1932. The excellent balance between the 'upstairs' haughty nobles and the 'downstairs' servants really made the plot move quickly. Also, this is one of the best casted films I can remember, especially Maggie Smith as the mother in law and Helen Mirren as one of the housekeepers.

436,mbjel,Tried watching three times - fell asleep every time.,1,18 July 2003,"Narcoleptics rejoice! After three failed attempts to make it through this movie I gave up.

437,rcampbell_yetholm,one of the best,9,3 April 2004,"I've never been a great fan of Robert Altman's films, but I was drawn to this by the cast.In the trailer I saw, I thought that Stephen Fry's detective looked great, but I have to say that he was probably the weakest link in an an otherwise great film.  The broad comedy in his scenes seemed to me to be inferior to the subtle social satire and wit that infected the rest of the film.I was also rather surprised by being tremendously moved by Helen Mirren's final scene; up until then I had been enjoying the film on a rather cerebral and analytical level, but she just blew me away with her show of emotion.Lots of things to say about the film:  first, what a fine actress Kelly McDonald is, despite her young years; the tremendous pleasure of watching actors like Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Emily Watson (the real star of the movie for me) and Charles Dance; the fully realised setting which made you believe this is what it really was like to be a servant in the years before World War 2.And thank God for DVDs.  Far be it from me to question Robert Altman's judgement, but I thought that just about every deleted scene on the DVD merited inclusion in the final film; in fact, I think a couple of them are actually needed.This is where novels are better than films: you can go for depth by including rather than brevity by editing.Still, a fine film, and one of the few that I would actually watch again.",Gosford Park
438,mike-1604,Great movie until the bumbling detective routine.,7,19 August 2005,The film is a meticulously crafted piece. Well acted and creating a wonderful illusion of life in an English country house. Then for me the illusion was suddenly shattered as Stephen Fry appears as the bumbling detective. Suddenly I was looking at television comedy and not the best. It was quite a shock. It is a considerable jump from the TV screen to acting on the big screen. Mr Fry did not manage it in this film and I think he brought it tumbling down with him. The character and script may not have helped and may have created a disjoint in the style of the film whoever played it. A great pity.Still worth watching though and possibly easier to accept when braced for the clumsy switch in style.,Gosford Park
439,conniewalsh80,Great film,8,27 January 2012,"Robert Altman has depicted the gory details of Nashville without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade of Altman's goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Altman has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.",Gosford Park
440,lowliestpeon,snore fest,2,19 June 2004,"I know Robert Altman's supposed to be a great director-I keep watching his movies expecting to be entertained, and I'm consistently underwhelmed. Everybody talks at the same time (ok-it's kinda cool/realistic, but you gotta turn on the close-captioning to figure out what everybody's mumbling about). There was a lot of actual drama going on. If the movie was done well, I would have cared about it, but it wasn't done well, and I didn't care. I liked the whole ""behind the scenes of the rich to see what the servants are doing"" thing. It just seemed totally flat to me-more boring than real life. Good actors, good idea for a movie, the movie LOOKED good, but it was just plain dull.",Gosford Park

Gosford Park wasn't made to focus on whodunit (if it was, why would they tell you who did). If viewers think that Gosford Park is ""boring"" or ""confusing"" or even ""the worst movie ever"", it may be that you're not willing to see what really is portrayed: the authenticity and its story. The authenticity of Gosford Park is as close as it can get to real life as it was back then as it can get. Experts who were maids, butlers, or cooks themselves were constantly at the scene criticizing the actors behavior and moves. Another main focus is the story behind it. The brilliant story as well as excellent character development are like no other: only Robert Altman could do a film such as this. So, next time you see it (which I highly recommend that you do), be PATIENT and actually be WILLING the enjoy the differences in film-making, not just the kind of films you like.",Gosford Park
442,beckieshotwell1117,"terrific movie that fits into comedy, suspense and mystery categories",8,13 August 2005,"I loved this film! I've watched it several times and find something new to the plot each time. You really have to pay attention because one line will reveal a secret about a character that is crucial to the story. I put on subtitles and learned so many details I had missed before. This movie is not for anyone who doesn't like subtle English humor or intricate plots. The DVD has many extras, like how they managed to stay accurate to the English country manor life and how the servants' lives are so intricately ordered. It helped me understand the movie much more because I was pretty clueless on how rigid the class rules were for the ""upstairs/downstairs"" order. I also hadn't understood how specific each servant's job was and that ""helping"" wasn't allowed across job descriptions. It was also interesting to see how much scrambling was done to secure positions of power in the hierarchy of downstairs.",Gosford Park
443,akvinby7-198-735070,Poor and derivative; Very weak; Doesn't quite come off,2,5 January 2015,"My abiding memory of this film is my irritation with the vastly overrated Julian Fellowes for being unable to get the language of the period right. In Britain of 1932, NO ONE said things like ""No worries!"" or ""End of story!"". There are other linguistic anachronisms, but these two are the worst ones. Both expressions are examples of modern ""estuary English"" and no educated person would ever utter either. The wealthy, the landed gentry, and the aristocracy in England would never even have heard this type of expression; in fact, they had not yet been invented. The ghastly, interminable soap ""EastEnders"" has a lot to answer for regarding the debasement of British English, as has the never-ending Australian soap ""Neighbours"".The plot is very derivative and there are glaring flaws and holes in the narrative. In some ways, Gosford Park reminds me of an Agatha Christie mystery but the plot simply doesn't hang together. HOW did the housekeeper KNOW that the son she gave up shortly after giving birth to him 31 years previously would kill his natural father? For that matter, HOW did she even know WHO he was? She had not seen her son since he was ca two weeks old! He was brought up in an orphanage, and at the age of 31 he is now the valet of Lord Stockbridge, who just happens to have been invited to stay at the country house belonging to Sir William, the man who fathered an illegitimate son on one of his female factory workers 32 years earlier. This woman is now the housekeeper at his, Sir William's, country house. That in itself is rather odd, to say the least. HOW did the valet KNOW that Sir William was his natural father? He states to a fellow servant that on his birth certificate it said ""Father unknown"". There are far too many incidents of the ""two terrible twins"": contrivance and coincidence.",Gosford Park
444,jane-p,Perfect for anarchists,8,31 October 2005,"A stealer of your fantastical thinking during three quarters of this film, you don't want it to conclude, and rightly so, as the feeble clues are not important and the outcome even less. The jousting for position by the acting stars right down to the lip movements is a game better than Cluedo. Historically it explains the reason for democracy although being 'downstairs' in those days had it's frisson.Americans dumped in the plot with their confusion overridden my forward-thinking is a fine allegory of today's politics.A joy for those who hanker after an understanding of the Upstairs Downstairs life within British aristocracy and essential viewing for anarchists.I'd have been the dog. ;)",Gosford Park
445,kristyl_g,Quite Enthralling,8,14 December 2005,"Gosford Park to put it very plainly is definitely worth your time. It is a brilliantly crafted piece of work.Set in the early 1930's, The story centers around a group of guests who have gathered at their wealthy and affluent host's country estate for a brief sojourn. However, whats interesting is that it's not just the guests who are important, the servants control the plot as well to an equal if not greater extent. The movie explores the relationships that the guests have with each other as well as with their servants.The cast is top-notch. The ever-glorious Maggie Smith who plays the role of Lady Trentham nails her character. Tart, condescending and snobbish, she revels in her role of old English gentry.I have never seen Kelly Macdonald act before, but I was very impressed by her performance. Cast as the maid Mary Maceachran waiting on lady Trentham, she manages to portray the necessary timidity and meekness, at the same time convincing the viewer of her understated loyalty and honest simplicity.Kristin Scott Thomas has a sizable role as Sylvia McCordle, the wife of the host. Hers I found somewhat of a complex character, for it was hard to fathom her out at once. The shades to her character were revealed very gradually over the course of the movie. But Thomas pulls it off very deftly, the transitions are smooth, and one learns about her as the story unfolds.Ryan Phillippe, perhaps obvious in a different sense for he stands out as an American actor among largely English co-stars, of mention-ably high pedigree. All may not agree with his performance, but I felt Phillippe held his own. As the valet to Mr.Weissman, he seems from the start as the the odd one out among the rest of the servants. And this is obvious to almost everyone who works down below stairs with him. His interaction with the others is intriguing to watch as they all suspect him of hiding some secret.Helen Mirren is another one of the fine English actresses in this film. She plays the role of Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper who essentially runs the whole show and the servants as well, much to their annoyance. She seems like a hard-hearted woman, who shuns the company of other human beings and can't abide anything other than subservient behavior from the domestics who are under her reign. All this plays out for most of the initial movie, but gradually we glimpse the cracks beneath the surface, which lead us to see that there is more to this women that meets the eye.Also notable among the cast are Clive Owen as the valet Robert Parks, who doesn't seem to be all that interested in valeting and Emily Watson as the maid Elsie. Watson I think does a really good job playing a maid who seems to want more from life than just waiting on people, but at the same time is tied to her employer for a very different reason.Summing it up, Gosford Park delivers. With a fine cast, crafty plot and fast-paced tempo, it makes for an enjoyable watching experience.",Gosford Park
446,edward-6,Hmm... what was so great?,3,21 January 2002,"In one word, if I have to describe - disappointment.  Understood, there was a satire of the English class structure, and some good acting by English actors, but that is all there is to it.  The number of characters kept increasing and you get caught up trying to keep up, which is very disconcerting, and takes your mind off of the actual subtleties which would probably make this movie a little more worthwhile than it actually is.
But, it was a drag with very little plot, which is plain boring and tedious! The two things missing were the lush scenery that I have come to expect of a period setting movie, and the mystery that it was described as.
There is so much hype, and so little in this movie, to warrant it.  I would wait for the DVD when it is rent one get one free, if I had to do it again.",Gosford Park
447,Humppa-Veikko,"Scattered, messy and fussy -- a pointless movie.",2,7 March 2005,"I had high hopes for this one, but unfortunately the terrible weaknesses in the script just made it impossible to suspend my tolerance enough to enjoy this. It is so obviously not a ""who dunnit"" that advertising it as such is just idiotic. Camouflaging the genre actually requires that the artwork itself is camouflaged, not just the poster.The pointlessly many characters are seen in scenes that have nothing to do with the story, and whose purpose as social commentary is rather questionable: for example,why should we be so interested in a fake valet trying to bonk everything that moves while a homosexual connection is hinted at? What is the point? The movie is full of these half-thought out ""scenes"" that do not tie in with anything. And then the trigger for actions is something entirely unbelievable: head maid blurting something out of place - absolute nonsense and not credible at all. The two points I gave go to Maggie Smith.",Gosford Park
448,keithkline,Worst Movie Ever,1,6 May 2002,"This was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The story was almost non-existent and the dialog was terrible.  The character development was also weak, although a movie of this type should have done a good job at that.  I can't believe this movie was up for Oscars.  Ryan Phillippe was probably the only interesting character in this movie, and he had a small role.  Maggie Smith was also good.  The movie was so boring I didn't even care what happened by the end.",Gosford Park
449,sdelmonte,"Overrated, as usual",5,19 June 2003,"I figured I would give  Robert Altman one more chance.  His other films have always struck me as dull and pretentious.  Despite fine performances by Maggie Smith (at least not wasted her as opposed to the Harry Potter films) and a few other familiar faces, the movie is slow, muddled and a bit cold. The murder mystery is not much of a mystery, the characters are generally unsympathetic, and the mumbling is so bad that I had to turn on the subtitles on my DVD to get everything.The end result is a too-familiar film, one that echoes half of the BBC and PBs's output since 1969, but with a better budget.  There is some slight wit in the screenplay, and the soundtrack is nice.  But people in search of a good mystery would be better off reading a Peter Wimsey book or tracking down the David Suchet Poirot series, and anyone looking for a drama set in the land of the British snob might as well just revisit Brideshead again.",Gosford Park

It was well acted (Stephen Fry apart),had an excellent script and was visually interesting. I agree that the action was slow moving but at least this gave time for the characters to develop.If you want to see action I suggest you go and watch that piece of nasty jingoistic, racist rubbish Black Hawk Down and leave the rest of us to watch something that at least engages the brain.Well deserving of it's Oscar nominations for both film and it's leading actors I enjoyed this film more than any other I've seen this year.

452,kevinmize,Altman does a great version of a Merchant/Ivory like movie.,9,21 January 2002,"I love Altman movies.  I've loved his movies since the 70's and even waited patiently throught the crap he did in the 80's to see the great stuff of the 90's.  It seems that most people that really love movies hold one of two positions on Altman.  They love him or hate him.  I don't mind two hours of little to no plot as long as I have good actors to watch and this movie has them.  If you are an Altman fan or if you are willing to wait while the plot comes slowly to the front, then go see this movie now.  If you don't like Altman films with their large and confusing casts and want the action up front and moving along all of the time, then don't go to see this movie.
Altman's movies are epic in the sense that there is a large scope to the story and an interesting tangent doesn't have to detract from the overall story.  The story that is told includes more than the bare bones of the story to be told.  The full story could be told in just a paragraph or two. But brevity would destroy the story.  The story is characters and their relationships.I see one or two movies a week at the theater and I have noticed in the last few months that the movies are getting better and that more people are going to see them.  When I went to Gosford Park the theater was FULL!  All of the seats were certainly not filled in the past for Short Cuts or Kansas City and not even for the more mainstream Altman pics of The Player or Dr. T and His Women.  I think we are moving into a time when movies are going to improve and have more people see them, and I am glad that Robert Altman is one of the director's to be there making those movies.",Gosford Park

Kelly McDonald was also very good as a fairly recent newcomer, and has made her mark in other films since.The difference between upstairs and downstairs staff is particularly highlighted, as are some of the relationships between staff and the upper classes.

454,frappy61-1,NOT Altman At His Finest!,3,11 January 2002,"How truly disappointing to see critics fall all over themselves, lavishing accolades upon a film that's a mere piffle, at best.  May I start by saying that I am a HUGE fan of Robert Altman's ensemble tapestries!  Though his overall prolific output has careened wildly over the past 30 years -- with more ""pits"" than ""cherries"" I might add; although those cherries are just about the sweetest one could ever hope for! (""Nashville,"" ""Short Cuts,"" ""3 Women,"" ""A Wedding,"" ""The Player,"" to name a few) -- the 90's brought about a revitalized creative energy from the great American director, after the downward spiral of his 80's output.  Granted, the 90's brought about a fair number of misses (""Kansas City,"" ""Pret A Porter,"" ""Dr. T. and The Women""), as well.  However, the heights reached by ""Short Cuts"" and ""The Player"" dwarf like a Mt. Olympus over those earnest and worthy, yet disjointed and disengaging efforts.  I eagerly awaited Mr. Altman's latest, ""Gosford Park,"" since reading ""Variety's"" Todd McCarthy's rave a few months ago. Subsequent and further reviews were also laudatory!  (In hindsight, to the point of obsequiousness!)  A half-hour into the film, seated in a packed theater with a noticeably inaudible audience, a friend nudged me with his elbow and whispered, ""Am I supposed to be laughing here?""  (It became a running joke for the next two hours.)  Much like the impression I had after my first visit to London to witness the starry hullabaloo of the West End theatrical scene -- seven ""highly-acclaimed"" plays, in seven cramped to dilapidated theaters, in a whirlwind four days -- my posterior felt numb and I couldn't help but feel that the critics must've seen a different version than the one I just witnessed.  (At least in the live theater outings, the plays came with intermissions and a bar.)  ""Gosford Park"" (sans intermission and spirits) was a complete and utter bore -- much like the ""boars"" that inhabited the film's wafer-thin scenario!  How arbitrary and lame was that whole third-rate ""Agatha Christie""-like thread!  Oh, you might say, ""Ahhh, but the acting!""  Like the world-weary ""upstairs"" characters, I was unimpressed by what can best be described as competent -- retreads of far superior characters in far superior stories/films.  Yes, those English actors sure have their bored airs down pat!  ""Gosford Park,"" my fellow filmgoers, is ultimately an expensive-looking, high-minded (read: ""snooty""), far-less amusing, far-less intriguing version of any number of Agatha Christie filmed novels, including sorely underappreciated ""Murder Under The Sun.""  If someone says that I'm missing the point, that the film is more a study of the classes and less about the murder and subsequent investigation, then I reply by saying:  ""Give me original characters worth studying! Give me original characters that I can care about!  Give me ANYTHING original!"" ""Murder By Death"" anyone???",Gosford Park

There are, of course, elements of both in it. In many scenes, I felt the focus was on the interaction between the English nobility and the serving class, with the American film producer Weissman as a foil since he belonged to neither. Other scenes, however seemed to set the audience up for the traditional ""who done it"" thriller with a surprise ending if we weren't clever enough to figure it out. What was lacking though was tension. There were no feelings of suspense. Nobody seemed worried that one of them was a murderer; no one took the detective seriously and he comes across like a buffoon. I also didn't understand how Countess Trentham's maid learned what she did, but that may because this film caused me to drift off frequently. It was a yawner.",Gosford Park

Credits should also be given to the convincing -only occasionally bombastic-performance of most of the actors/actresses.But who can really account for the sadistically slow progression of the plot? We may be aware of the basic cinematographic and literary device of retarding the flow of events, but exceeding the limits of that technique is bound to bring about sheer boredom. To make matters worse, an initially sporadic and gradually frequent lack of coherence resulted in the film's fragmentation and in a feeling of confusion and profound discontent.Embitterment will haunt you for a while after watching the movie, but then it will disappear into oblivion.",Gosford Park

The ensemble cast dazzles, the film is visually gorgeous, and while the plot is secondary it is great fun, and the denouement is terrific.  The tapestry that Altman has woven is so rich that the film needs to be seen at least twice to get all of the marvel and joy of it.While Maggie Smith is outstanding, there is not a clunker in the cast, and the newcomers are as fascinating as the old faces. Alan Bates has been in films for over forty years and there others who have been around as long, and they all just seem to get better and better.This is a movie lover's movie.",Gosford Park

462,frap,another disappointment from altman. what a shame,6,9 November 2001,"Gosford Park premiered in London, at the city's festival, which doesn't dish out any awards. Probably just as well as Altman's latest doesn't run the risk of winning any. It's a disappointment to see the man who gave us Short Cuts, possibly the greatest film of the 1990s, come up with a string of turkeys. Gosford Park is the fourth installment in what one had hoped would have remained just a trilogy of rotten eggs (pret a porter, cookie's fortune and Dr. T) On the face of it all we have all the ingredients to make a great film: a fabulous cast too long to list playing the aristocrats and their servants, superb period setting in the 1930s, in the gap between the two word wars. The themes are endless: class struggle within the microcosm of an grand and isolated country estate; a once-fearsome naval power losing its grip on its empire and desperately holding on to its fusty traditions; America, the teething threat across the waters, embarking on its cultural invasion of Europe. Alas, what Altman gives us is a shallow Upstairs-Downstairs scenario laden with cut out cardboard characters. To make sense of these shallow and uninteresting people he gives us a hackneyed and pointless murder mystery plot, which even Agatha Christie would have disowned. The danger of bringing together over twenty actors, all used to being protagonists, is that you fail to flesh them out and allocate each of them a time slot to taken centre stage and shine. It was a trap Altman ingeniously didn't fall into in both Nashville and Shortcuts, when he solicited understated yet compelling performances from every single of his vast ensemble cast. His genius was to weave the intricate strands of the story into a coherent and gripping mosaic of people and their environment, combining humor with human tragedy. What can I say, Kristin Scott Thomas is utterly wasted. Charles Dance barely gets a word in. Maggie Smith is a painful caricature, but a mildly amusing one at that. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and Emily Watson, playing someone who isn't hysterical and neurotic for a change, redeem themselves. They're all far too good to be playing bit players.",Gosford Park

The music is the icing on the cake. And, like a cake, there are layers to it. Every time I watch it, I get something more from it. A brilliant idea executed brilliantly. All the actors ""are"" those characters to the tee. Dame Maggie, ever the quintessential snob; Dame Helen, ""mysterious"" to the end. Oh that there were more movies like this, that transport one so completely to another time and place. Watch it on in a rainy afternoon when you want nothing more than that.

Clive Owen is smoldering and charming. The Kelly Macdonald role is an interesting use of a female protagonist, who also gets to be the detective in the mystery. Her role and how she develops as a character is very nicely woven into the progression of the story. The plainly stated depiction of a dying social class and a time of masters and servants is both poignant and satirical at the same time.

Many of the scenes consist of nothing but the characters being involved in such riveting events like: a) playing bridge, b) listening to some yahoo sing & play the piano, and c) shooting birds.  You would think they would save these ""captivating action scenes"" for the Special Edition DVD, but no, Altman goes all out for the big film!Anyhow, if you still insist on sitting through this , I suggest that you not go in on a full stomach.  Much like the exciting roller-coaster rides at Disney World, you'll be puking your guts out half-way through this film.Unfortunately, that's about as close as I can get to saying ""exciting"" and ""Gosford Park"" in one sentence.",Gosford Park

Despite the wonderful cast, i felt that there was not one character in the whole film that stood out other than Helen Mirren who was fantastic.Therefore i urge you, ignore the critics who will write up anything set pre 1950, unless you want to sit through two and a half hours of turning to the person next to you saying, ""Do you know what the hell is going on?"", and be left not even caring 'whodunit', DO NOT go and see this film!!",Gosford Park

All of you folks, who were expecting an Agatha Christie retread with whitewashed enough accents and a simplistic enough plot so that even JimJoeBob with an IQ of 90 in Podunk can understand it, can go sit at the back of the class.It is not Agatha Christie. It is not an A&E special. It is not really a murder mystery - we solve the crime through the eyes of a particular character, not through the eyes of a detached viewer.It is quintessential Robert Altman, only with an Anglophile bent. Altman's movies are all like this - ensemble casts, interwoven storylines, no clean-cut hero. Don't like those sort of movies? Go watch Attack of the Clones when it comes out. From the trailer that was shown before Gosford Park started, that might be far easier for you to understand.Those who have criticized the film for having ""hard to understand accents"" only reveal their isolation from the rest of the world. Xenophobia ain't pretty, folks. Those who have criticized the film for having a hard to understand plot need to pay better attention. The entirety of the crime /does/ come out in the last five minutes, albeit in hysteria. Those who have criticized the film for acting, screenplay, cinematography, directing... oh, wait. Nobody did.Maybe that says something. :)",Gosford Park

I have watched the film about a dozen times and am still taken back by the hyper attention to detail. I get amused when someone refers to Gosford Park as a murder mystery. The murder is secondary to the plot, if that. This movie is all about the British class system. For me, the most interesting thing is to watch is the dependency the landed gentry had on the servant class. Another element is the class stratification that occurred upstairs extended to the downstairs as well. An interesting point one of the downstairs characters made was: ""Why do we live our lives through theirs?"" The interaction between the characters is very interesting to watch. The acting was absolutely first class. The direction, up to Altman's usual standards. One thing I don't usually mention is the movie sounds track. It complemented the movie quite well. I will say it is the first movie sound track I have ever purchased. I am quite comfortable placing this movie in my top 5 favorites.",Gosford Park

486,poldrugo,Poisoning and stabbing father in the back,1,13 August 2002,"While the film deserves acknowledgement for the carefully prepared social and historical setting of worthy documentary standards the overall opinion cannot be anything but negative and profoundly disgusting. The plot is centred on the moral justification of parricide and to a lesser extent on the coverup of the homicidal avengement by the parricidal ""victim mother"". These aberrations derive from cliche of well known origin whereby in the son's distorted feelings the father is guilty of vile egoism whereas the mother's (or rather The Mother's) own pursuit comes over as saintly altruistic. In the depraved fantasy of the parricidal maniac the Mother figure is held so highly that her earthly presence is unconceivable (let alone under the same roof and at the services of a tyrannical father) only heaven itself seems a worthy sanctuary. The poor son can only presume her having died out of heart break for the very loss of her child. The son's understandable resentment is focused solely on the father without even considering the slightest blame on the Mother. The saintly MUM does have the decency however of never revealing herself thereby avoiding her son's disappointment. The moral of the film takes for granted that the carnal union which gave birth to the parricidal maniac is the result of the disgusting habits of the father and that the mother's innocence was taken advantage of due to her state of need bringing upon her the suffered loss of her chastity. A moral both obscene and stereotype which the film nonetheless thrusts out at its audience without any second thoughts in the knowledge that it will encounter their complacent  and dishonest approval anyway.",Gosford Park
487,nwbrewer,Better drink a gallon of coffee first.,5,9 September 2002,"Gosford Park about a group of snotty rich folks gathering in a fancy house to socialize and hunt, had few interesting moments, and hours of careless film-making. Unforunately, the ""mystery"" was extremely weak, and not even very much fun to figure out. There are just so many characters introduced that have no point in being in the film, are not even thinkably involved in the murder. So what's the point of introducing, and wasting so much time on totally boring characters?The only aspect of the film that at all interested me was the relationships between the servants.

The acting, featuring one of the widest range of British talent that I have ever seen, was largely excellent and felt very real. The film is well written, and provides story arcs for all characters, major and minor.My problem with this film is that two hours is not nearly long enough to wrap up all of the plot elements in a good way. The ending seems rushed and does not provide closure for me. I cannot believe that this is the way that an obviously very talented director like Altman would have wanted to wrap up his film, so I would be very interested to see whether he will recut the film in years to come.",Gosford Park

Ryan Phillippe and Kristen Scott Thomas are the lowest of the cast with a rather limited acting ability. Maggie Smith exemplifies the world of acting at its most promising. Her character is one that exudes a subtle humor with witty comments and critical remarks at just the right moment. Her performance never bores people as she has never done in other films. Supporting her talent is Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren, both interesting, somewhat cryptic characters to leave people wondering about their thoughts and lives. All of these factors come together to create a splendid, thoroughly enjoyable moment.",Gosford Park
493,Mbyrne11,Justice regarding Poverty,4,3 July 2009,"With this film taking place in the 1930's in Britain, it is obvious that the film is trying to convey the distinction of people in a social status. The whole household is filled with many problems, for all the different people. The ""upstairs"" people are terrifically unhappy because they are so worried about their wealth. But, the serving staff is also a mess because there's so much gossip and duties that they don't have time to just relax and enjoy themselves. Upstairs, Sir William and his younger wife, Lady Sylvia, engage in a very relaxed lifestyle of shooting, dinners and parties, and downstairs, while the servants are downstairs and they work endlessly under the command of the butler Mr. Jennings, and the house keeper Mrs. Wilson. The poor and less fortunate are treated horribly in this film, and the motto seems to be, ""If you're rich you can do whatever the hell you want, but if you're poor you need to slave all day for the rich."" This is an unjust way to live and treat the poor, and this movie was made to challenge our society to give them the respect they deserve. There is definitely a hierarchy in the household, especially with the cooks and those who work in the kitchen. There are many times when characters ask each other what job they held previously, and at one time one of the cooks took offense to being called a factory worker. Also, in another part of the film a servant walks through the room where all of the rich are chatting, but when he walks through everyone goes silent. This shows how poorly treated and disrespected they are in culture. A few more examples of the unjust hierarchy in this estate are that the servants' quarters have no windows, everyone sits at the dining table in order of their employers' social rank, and the maids are referred to by their masters' and mistresses' names instead of their own. The wealthiest characters in Gosford Park all have an extremely bias view on the world where they look down upon those who are less wealthy. They aren't respected as well, or treated with as much dignity. It's like the poor in our society today, because we don't value them at all. In the movie, Freddie and Isabelle are interrupted by a footman while in a conversation, and Freddie says, ""It's nobody."" This is just another example of the dehumanizing and unjust treatment of the poor.The only concern that the wealthy characters in the film had was how to obtain more wealth. One main example in the film where money is aggressively sought after is the time when Freddie Nesbitt had finished going through his wife's money, and started an affair with McCordle's daughter, Isabelle, in an attempt to blackmail her and getting her father to find a position for him. He uses the girl because he wants more money, and like every other character in the film he's all about greed. Another example where wealth is the only focus is the time when Sir William and Lady Sylvia cut cards with one of Lady Sylvia's sisters to see who would have the money from the wealthy businessman.In the end of the movie, Sir William is murdered. The 'blame game' goes on inside the estate for quite awhile, until Robert Parks fesses up to Mary that he killed Sir William. But Mary is Parks' mother, and she knew that Parks was eventually going to kill Sir William because he had abandoned Parks at an orphanage as a child, and he abused his workers. The message Gosford Park is getting across is you can be the wealthiest man in the world, but that will not buy you happiness. Sir William was extremely wealthy, but he abused almost everyone that worked for him, and he even abused his son by leaving him to grow up at an orphanage. It all came back to get him in the end, and what we need to take away from this film is that every human being, no matter how rich or poor you are, deserves the same respect and dignity as everyone else in order to achieve a just world.HOW MANY ""STARS"" (out of 4)? 1.5",Gosford Park

It is far from a simple story - but if you give it some attention you will be invited into a world of elegance, thrilling intersections, and personal stories. I enjoyed very much also the second and third watches of this film, catching all the details. It's beautifully set, and if you fancy the style of the 30s you might find pleasure in the dresses and environments (shifting between upstairs and downstairs).

Those who have described it as thin and boring have simply missed the point; probably because their senses have been dulled by SFX and obvious plots. Robert Altman has used his extraordinary insight to show the multi-layered dependency of the Edwardian English upper classes and their servants in the twilight of their existence. Not only is it a remarkable script, but it is brought to light by an array of the finest acting talents Britain can muster. Of course it takes an hour to bring in all the characters because that is what the film is about. The plots and sub plots are almost incidental to the interweaving of the relationships and the complex development of character, often in a single sentence or even word.

I turned on the English subtitles after a while, and I enjoyed the movie more thereafter, even though I had to continue to read the subtitles throughout the movie. I do think the movie portrayed how the upper class English people viewed and treated their servants in the 1930's in an accurate manner.

I'll say more: This movie makes uncomfortable watching, perhaps that's a tribute to the director. He really does give a sense of living in the 30s; OTOH, the movie was preceded by an old TV series that already dramatized the tensions between the rich and their servants (Upstairs, Downstairs).To repeat, this movie is over-rated, over-long, and over-done.Altman surely could chosen a better story?But maybe he simply had to impress some UK duchess or such and set the story in that milieu.Otherwise, why bother?

We see the clash between nouveau riche and aristocracy, Americans disdained by the British, a very UNsympathetic lord of the house (as opposed to Hugh Bonneville's mostly good-guy), mouthy Maggie Smith yet to show any softer sides, the proud downstairs hierarchy with transient alliances plus one tender romance, a servant-on-servant assault, one beady-eyed, suspicion-provoking footman (Richard Grant becomes Rob James-Collier)...So much harder to care about these characters than those in Downton Abbey.

Switching points of view, which was pulled off so successfully in Downton Abbey, is muddling here. Also disappointing are the costumes, which lack Downton's elegance. Overall, the movie is worth seeing if only for its star-studded cast: which includes, notable for Downton fans, the same pairing of Maggie Smith and the actor playing her butler as in Downton.

506,ga_ohoyt,Best of the big-cast Altmans,10,22 August 2021,"When first exploring the movies of Robert Altman, most people make the mistake of going right for the large-ensemble ones like Short Cuts. I much prefer his smaller scale films: McCabe and Mrs. Miller, California Split, 3 Women, The Long Goodbye. Or his medium-scale efforts: MASH, Cookie's Fortune, A Prairie Home Companion.But here's a big-cast Altman that works beautifully. In a Sherlock Holmes or an Agatha Christie movie, you may not know whodunnit, but you know who will solve the case. Here you don't even know that going in, though you're pretty sure it won't be the police. The film lets us become invested in the characters through the most economical means. We form connections with them before we even learn their names. Writer Fellowes meshes well with the director, and we can hear their individual voices without hearing them clash. A funny, superbly crafted work.",Gosford Park
