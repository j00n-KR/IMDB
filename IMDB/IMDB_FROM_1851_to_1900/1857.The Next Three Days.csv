0,Leofwine_draca,Passable remake,5,8 October 2013,"THE NEXT THREE DAYS is the American remake of a French thriller about an ordinary guy who has no option but to bust his wife out of prison and go on the run when she starts experiencing mental health difficulties. Watching this, I couldn't help but wonder what the original movie would have been like and how much better it could have possibly been.THE NEXT THREE DAYS is certainly a passable thriller by Hollywood standards as it maintains a tense realism throughout. Russell Crowe is well cast as the dedicated family man willing to do anything it takes to get his family back together and the thriller aspects of the story, particularly the prison break elements, are well handled.However, one real problem the film has is the padding; it seems go on and on and on without ever going anywhere, especially in the early on scenes which feature Crowe trying to make some contacts on the streets. Paul Haggis handles the direction well, but he needed to employ a ruthless editor when it came to the length. I'm not quite sure how this happened, since the original French film has a relatively short running time in comparison.The other problem with Elizabeth Banks, who just doesn't work as a convincing, serious actress. She was fine in SLITHER, but in this and MAN ON A LEDGE she feels badly out of her depth. The nadir of the film comes during the inexcusably cheesy moment where she's hanging out of the car and screaming; I've rarely seen such nonsense outside of a B-movie!",The Next Three Days
1,SnoopyStyle,Not bad but it needs to be tightened,6,21 October 2014,"Three years ago, Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for murdering her boss Elizabeth Gesas. Her life with her husband John (Russell Crowe) and her infant son is shattered. The evidence is damning, a possible witness isn't found, and any appeal is unlikely to work. John decides to break her out of Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburg with lots of preparations. It's nearly impossible and then he is surprised by Lara's transfer in 3 days. He has to rush his plans before he's ready.The first time around, the movie seems like a well written if somewhat long. After another viewing, the story is doing a lot of things that are too neatly written. It doesn't feel real. The first two thirds is the preparations and the various detours. The final third is the actual escape. The movie is over 2 hours and it's a bit slow at times. The preparations don't raise the tension all the time. It needs to be tighten greatly. Paul Haggis is not able to sharpen this movie to a finer edge. The escape has a nice intensity. The acting is superb and even the minor roles are filled with great actors. The movie tries to do a lot. There is a back and forth about her guilt or innocence. There is another woman. There are cops investigating him. And then there is the drug deal robbery. Maybe it's too much. Again it needs to be tightened somehow.",The Next Three Days
2,Hitchcoc,Just Too Far Fetched to Satisfy Me!,7,22 May 2012,"When a film that portends to be realistic with real down to earth characters pushes the envelope too far, I just can't buy into it. Oh, it looks good, and I am as big a Russell Crowe fan as there is, but the plotting and the results of the action were just beyond my willingness to suspend belief. It is a standard plot. One character is accused of a crime and actually convicted. The other is left with the task of finding enough to save that person. We have the obligatory escape from prison and then a series of efforts to overturn the unjust verdict. Everything is just so pat and predictable and often too ""easy."" Things just don't fall into place like this and I know it's only a movie. But the competition is fierce and demands our acceptance. Perhaps I'm too serious, but other than the potential satisfaction of justice restored, it wasn't quite up to snuff.",The Next Three Days
3,Prismark10,Breakout,6,19 August 2018,"The Next Three Days is an overlong thriller that is certainly far fetched and could had benefited from some judicial pruning. Writer and director still manages to make an enjoyable but flawed movie.Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) has been jailed for killing her boss after an argument. The case against her is watertight. Lara's college professor husband John (Russell Crowe) is left raising their infant son with the help of his family.With no prospects of winning an appeal, John plans to break her out of prison and go on the lam. He spends lots of time talking to convicts who have escaped from prison, researching, getting false ids together. He needs to speed up his plans when he finds out that his wife is getting transferred in three days time.The film takes time to get going, the last third is preposterous as the police give chase. Banks character is never convincing and goes out of her way to make the plan fail. It is still an intriguing remake of a French movie.",The Next Three Days
4,claudio_carvalho,"A Popcorn Remake of the French Thriller ""Pour Elle"" (2008)",6,2 April 2011,"In Pittsburgh, the family man and community college teacher John Brennan (Russell Crowe) has his life turned upside down when his beloved wife Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested, accused for murdering her boss, and sent to the Allegheny County Jail. Along three years, John raises their son Luke (Ty Simpkins) alone and appeals to the court; however, the evidences against Lara are solid – the motive, since she had and argument with her boss; her fingerprints in the murder weapon, a fire extinguisher; blood stain in her coat; and a witness that saw her leaving the parking lot - and her lawyer exhausts all the possible resources in justice. John believes in the innocence of his wife and interviews a former escapee from prison to learn how to plan a prison break. Then he plots a scheme to release Lara and travel abroad with Luke and her. However, he needs documents for the family; an escape plan; and lots of money. When John is informed that Lara will be transferred to the state prison within the next three days, he needs to raise a large amount and anticipate his strategy before the transference.A couple of days ago I wrote:quote ""The Next Three Days"" is a good thriller that could have been excellent with minor modifications in the screenplay. The story of a family man that loves and believes that his imprisoned wife is innocent and plans to rescue her from prison is engaging. But the correct guesses and the serendipity of Lieutenant Nabulsi (Lennie James) are irritating and Lara's reckless attitude on the road is so stupid that almost destroy the plot of this good blockbuster film. I enjoyed a lot seeing Brian Dennehy again after a long period. Last but not the least, the mesmerizing beauty of Olivia Wilde is awesome. My vote is seven. unquoteHowever, I have just watched the great French thriller ""Pour Elle"", which has the original story without the absurd modifications of the popcorn American remake. It is amazing the lack of creation of this former successful American industry that insists in the remake of great films. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""72 Horas"" (""72 Hours"")",The Next Three Days
5,kosmasp,Pour Elle,7,16 January 2011,"That is the title of the original french movie this is based on. And funnily enough that movie is not that old. So is there a reason to watch this if you already know the original? I'd say hardly. There are a few differences, but in the end most things (results) are the same in both movies. It has been ""americanized"", if you want to call it that, but Paul Haggis and Russell Crowe are there to make sure, it does not get out of hand too much.But to tell you the truth, I'm pretty sure that most people will not even have heard of the Original French movie. So if you go into the movie completely unaware, you will either relish in the entertainment value the movie offers or be mad at some illogical twists and turns during the end of the movie. Let yourself be entertained, if you can!",The Next Three Days
6,jboothmillard,The Next Three Days,5,13 April 2014,"From director Paul Haggis (Crash, In the Valley of Elah), this despite having the big star from Gladiator probably wasn't one of the most promoted at the time of it's release, and I knew it was likely to be worthy of three out of five stars, but I still wanted to watch it. Basically in Pittsburgh, John Brennan (Russell Crowe), a family man and community college teacher has his life turned upside down when his beloved wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is suddenly arrested for the accused murder of her boss, without any proof of her innocence she is convicted and sent to Allegheny County Jail. Three years pass and John has been forced to raise their son Luke (Insidious's Ty Simpkins) alone and continues to appeal for his wife's release in court, but with a motivation for murder, an argument with the boss, her fingerprints on the fire extinguisher used as the murder weapon, his blood stain on her coat, and a witness seeing her leave the parking lot where it occurred, the evidence against her being solid and her lawyer unable to sway the verdict. John is the only person who believes that Lara is innocent, so following any sources he can find he is trying to work out a way to break her out of the prison, including an interview with a former escapee, and after this scheme is complete they will travel abroad with their son, but he needs a good escape plan, false passports and new identities, and a lot of money. He is informed that within the next three days Lara will be transferred to the state prison,so he needs to move fast to get the money he needs and plan a strategy before she is moved, he uses drastic measures, including robbery and conning a drug lord. John manages to falsify his wife's blood test results to make it look like she has a high amount of potassium in her system, and being transferred to a hospital he is able to get her out of the ambulance and help her escape, she is reluctant to go with his plan, but the idea of Luke being raised without either parent is too persuasive. John and Lara reach the airport and have a nervous trip through airport security, it is only when the guard is changing his shift that they avoid being recognised as their ""wanted"" photographs are put out, but the police were fooled to go to the wrong terminal, and the couple with their son manage to get away undetected and take off. In the end John and Lara are safe in Caracas, Venezuela, and meanwhile investigating Lieutenant Nabulsi (The Prisoner's Lennie James) goes to the crime scene, theorising that Mrs. Brennan may have been innocent, the murderer was a mugger who bumped into her, and a button from her coat may have gone down a drainpipe when it was raining, the detective just misses the button under the grime. Also starring Jason Beghe as Detective Quinn, Aisha Hinds as Detective Collero, Liam Neeson as Damon Pennington, Olivia Wilde as Nicole, Brian Dennehy as George Brennan, Daniel Stern as Meyer Fisk, Kevin Corrigan as Alex, Jonathan Tucker as David, RZA as Mouss, Moran Atias as Erit, James Ransone as Harv, Trudie Styler as Dr. Byrdie Lifson and Jurassic Park III's Bruce A. Young as Craftsman in Elevator. Crowe is relatively good as the determined husband who will do anything to get his family back, Banks does alright with her time on screen as well, the grittiness is evident with the good use of grey looking Philadelphia locations, the story is pretty simple if a little slow on occasions, but the chase and tension sequences keep you just about gripped, it is a standard but good enough crime drama. Worth watching!",The Next Three Days
7,ccthemovieman-1,Almost-Unbearable Suspense,8,16 April 2011,"Credibility is stretched here to the max....but so what? This is a fun film to watch and one of the mores suspenseful ones you'll ever see. The last 30-40 minutes is unbearably tense.Russell Crowe, as usual, is very good in the lead role, playing schoolteacher ""John Brennan."" Elizabeth Banks is riveting in her scenes as John's wife ""Lara,"" who is charged and convicted of murder.After it appears all hope is lost, Brennan - with a ton of obstacles ahead of him - tries the impossible: break his wife out of jail and flee the country with her and their young son. There are so many twists and turns, up and downs, in this story it will make your head swim.....but it is entertaining. Prepare to be exhausted when the movie is over but don't take much of it seriously.",The Next Three Days
8,rmax304823,Frantic Pursuit.,6,1 October 2016,"Not bad. Russel Crowe's wife, Elizabeth Banks, is sentenced to life for murder. Crowe concocts an incredibly complex plan to break her out of the slams and flee with her and their little son to Venezuela.Crowe is described as a schoolteacher, evidently of literature because he's teaching a class on Cervantes. So here he is, a naive pedagogue, and he escapes with his wife. How, you, the discerning viewer ask? Well, he reads a book about prisons and has a five-minute consult with the guy who wrote the book on prison escapes, Liam Neeson. Neeson has what amounts to a bit part. Only slightly more important are other recognizable names and faces, especially Brian Dennehy and Olivia Wilde, with her hard angelic beauty.The entire movie is a fantasy, of course. Crowe's schoolteacher buys a pistol. (""Show me where the bullets go."") Then he invades a meth factory, steals their cache, kills the main operator, and tries to blow the place up.The final two thirds of the movie are a frenzied chase. Crowe, Banks, and their kid are screeching around the streets of Pittsburgh, trying to elude the police, who are zipping around in their white squad cars and exercising a fulgurating intuition about who's who, what's what, and where -- labyrinthine enough to lose me from time to time.If you strip the story down to its bare bones -- rid it of modern devices, crashing automobiles, and exploding fireballs -- what you get is an old-fashioned film noir plot, and an exciting one. A brooding question hangs over the mystery -- did Banks actually commit the murder? After all, she says she did.The moral of the story: It appears to rain a lot in Pittsburgh.",The Next Three Days
9,blanche-2,fantastic,8,14 November 2012,"Russell Crowe is desperate to break his wife (Elizabeth Banks) out of jail in ""The Next Three Days,"" a 2010 film directed by Paul Haggis.Crowe and Banks play John and Lara Brennan, a happily married couple with one child. Lara is arrested and convicted to life in prison for murdering her boss, though she claims she didn't do it. A woman brushed by her as she was entering the parking lot where her boss was found dead. However, because her prints were on the murder weapon and blood was on her coat, the jury votes guilty.A few years pass and John and Lara hold onto hope that she will win her appeal, but she doesn't. John realizes that he has no choice but to break her out of jail. His timeline is shattered when he learns that she's being transferred to prison soon, giving him only three days.Wonderful, action-packed and gut-wrenching story of a normal man who is so desperate he nearly goes insane. Crowe is remarkable as John,a teacher who talks about Don Quixote living in a world of his own reality. He soon must practice what he preaches as he walks the mean streets in order to work out a careful plan, even as he cares for his young son Luke (Ty Simpkins) who has become more and more withdrawn and angry since his mother's imprisonment.Beautifully directed by Paul Haggis, The Next Three Days keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout -- you're never sure what's going to happen or how far John will go. There is a wordless scene between John and his father (Brian Dennehy) that will break your heart.Besides Crowe, Banks, and Dennehy, the excellent cast also includes Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde, and Jason Beghe. Don't miss this.",The Next Three Days
10,Theo Robertson,A Strange Mix Featuring Character And Action,6,7 April 2014,When did Russell Crowe's star start to fade ? At the turn of the century he was the biggest movie star in the world . Not bad for someone who amongst other things had a couple of episodes of Aussie soap NEIGHBOURS on his resume . As I write this I'm looking forward to seeing Crowe in NOAH but the selling point of that film is that it's a biblical epic along with being directed by Darren Aronofsky the most talented and imaginative director working in Hollywood today . Certainly my motive for seeing it is entirely down to a visionary director than the star . In fact I have a serious problem naming a movie in recent years that starred Crowe and it's not like I'm disinterested in cinema . This movie written and directed by Oscar winning screenwriter Paul Haggis stars Crowe and co-stars a few other well known names including Liam Neeson and features a high concept plot based upon an earlier French movie . In other words it's not difficult to market and yet for some I didn't know it existed until Channel 5 broadcast it last nightHaggis has a reputation for character driven pieces and he is actually well suited to the material here . The premise of a man whose wife is sentenced to life imprisonment and trying to bust her out of a jail means an audience are probably expecting a lot more in the way of action and this isn't really how the movie unravels . If you're expecting Crowe to come abseiling through windows all guns blazing to rescue the woman he loves then you're going to be very disappointed . Instead we get a very introspective performance from Crowe playing a family man . It's hardly an Oscar winning performance but it's not bad . You do get the very strong feeling Crowe took the role on in order to escape his type casting as a tough guy and the role calls for a certain amount of vulnerability which Crowe pulls off . The problem is that the film feels the need to turn in to an action thriller towards the end and this is jarring compared to the majority of the film that existed quite well without much action,The Next Three Days
11,zardoz-13,Good Prison Break Drama with a Good Crowe Performance,8,30 November 2010,"Academy Award winning writer & director Paul Haggis puts Oscar winner Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks through the wringer as a husband breaking his wife out of jail in the American remake of the 2008 French thriller ""Anything for Her."" ""The Next 3 Days"" qualifies as an exciting but implausible suspense saga enhanced by adroitly staged action scenes, top-notch performances from a seasoned cast, and enough red herrings and obstacles to make you want to gnaw your fingernails. Best known for scripting and helming ""Crash,"" Haggis took home an Oscar for writing and directing and the film clinched Best Picture. He received an Oscar for his ""Million Dollar Baby"" screenplay, and he is credited as one of the creators for the long-running Chuck Norris television series ""Walker, Texas Ranger."" Recently, Haggis wrote two of the less James Bond extravaganzas: ""Casino Royale"" and ""Quantum of Solace."" Basically, Haggis knows a thing or two about actioneers, and he makes an incredible jailbreak seem credible in ""The Next 3 Days."" Moreover, aside from its hefty two hour plus length, this pulse pounding, distaff version of ""The Fugitive"" remains largely faithful to its Gallic source material. The City of Pittsburgh plays an important part in the plot and ""The Next 3 Days"" serves as a first-class travelogue for the town. Unlike many movies that shoot city landmarks to authenticate their yarns and then shoot urban scenes in Canada, Pittsburgh has no stand-ins. Pittsburgh natives will probably be the only ones to groan about some of the logistical contradictions of the town. Anybody who has seen the ""Mythbusters"" television show will know that utilizing air pressure by means to a tennis ball to unlock a door won't work. However, there are many sites about bump keys on YouTube like the one featured here that our protagonist watches for information. As gripping as PG-13 rated ""The Next 3 Days"" is, Haggis never lets the violence, drug material, profane language, and sexuality become gratuitously gritty. ""The Next 3 Days"" opens in a restaurant as John Brennan (Russell Crowe of ""Robin Hood"") and his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks of ""Role Models"") are dining with John's brother Mick (Michael Buie of ""Mystery, Alaska"") and Mick's wife Erit (Moran Atias of ""Land of the Lost""). Workplace politics precipitates an argument, and Erit insists a woman can serve under a man better than a man can serve under a woman. Lara suspects Erit is trying to seduce John, and the two ladies clash. Later, the next morning, Lara and John are enjoying breakfast with their young son Luke. Lara snaps a photo of them. No sooner has this scene of domestic happiness transpired than the Pittsburgh Police Department converge on John' house. They arrest Lara for the murder of her boss. Lara's boss was a woman and Haggis inserts a flashback of Lara and her superior arguing. Eventually, Lara storms down to the parking lot and collides with an unknown woman. We see Lara pick up a fire extinguisher. A bystander entering the high rise parking lot spots Lara leaving and notices a woman sprawled on the concrete by her car. Since Lara got into an argument with her boss, the Pittsburgh Police arrest her. They find Lara's trench coat that she was in the process of washing out a blood stain. The blood stain matches the DNA of her murdered boss. Based on this evidence, the jury finds Lara guilty. John refuses to believe that Lara could coldly kill her boss and then sit through a diner date without betraying herself. Over the course of the next three years, the predicament John and Lara face grows steadily worse. John's attorney, Meyer Fisk (Daniel Stern of ""Home Alone""), tries to get John to examine the evidence from an objective perspective so he can understand why their appeal failed. Things come to a boil quickly as Lara tries to commit suicide. She doesn't want to endure a twenty year stretch for murder. John decides to take matters into his own hands. He contacts an ex-con, Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson of ""The A-Team""), who has penned a book about his prison exploits, specifically his many escapes. Damon warns John to be prepared because the police will catch him by blocking off the bridges around Pittsburgh and shoot him on sight. John devises an elaborate escape plan which requires him to enter the criminal underworld. Primarily, John needs forged passports authentic enough to fool the authorities so he can relocate his family to South America. John learns quickly that trying to break Lara out of prison is no picnic. He is nearly caught at one point in the prison using a bump key. Nevertheless, John explores all the possibilities with a scrapbook map plastered onto one wall of his house. This scene and setting recall the ABC-TV series ""Prison Break"" where the hero sought to break his brother out of prison. John discovers that breaking Lara out of jail isn't so easy so he tampers with Lara's diabetes medical folder. Initially, Lara refuses to accompany him when John gets the drop of the cops escorting her.The last half hour of ""The Next 3 Days"" moves like a roller-coaster with many surprises to heighten the suspense. A paunchy Crowe looks believable as John Brennan; Brennan teaches English literature at a community college teacher. He is the last person who would embark on such a desperate mission. John doesn't discuss his ideas with his father and mother. Elizabeth Banks is good as his imprisoned wife. Somewhere along the way, Lara confides in John that she did kill her boss. John doesn't let this revelation alter his plans. Haggis keeps the action careening along at top speed, and Crowe makes the hero a sympathetic fellow. Crowe's character shift from a peaceful community college to a gun-toting thug is impressive. ""The Next 3 Days"" ranks as an exciting melodrama with surprises galore.",The Next Three Days

Better than anticipated drama/thriller with Crowe as a man facing insurmountable odds: breaking his wife (Banks) out of prison after she has been revoked parole and looking at a lifetime imprisonment for murder. While it is a familiar and occasionally predictable plot the direction by its screenwriter Paul Haggis makes up for it with some ingenious moments (using a tennis ball to break into a car for one!) and lets his lead man do the thing he does best: implosive dedication for setting thing right.",The Next Three Days
13,neil-476,"Far more Hollywood than the French original, but still a decent thriller",7,6 January 2011,"Lara Brennan is serving life for a murder which, her husband believes, she did not commit. As her final appeal fails she attempts suicide. At this point her teacher husband John (Russell Crowe) comes to the conclusion that the only course of action left to him is to break her out of prison and flee the country with her and their son. To do this, however, he will have to discover how far into the criminal underworld he is prepared to go.This is a remake of the French thriller Pour Elle (All for Her) of a couple of years ago. That was a gripping and rather low key little movie. Russell Crowe doesn't really do low key, and the final break out sequence is far larger scale and more action packed (and more filled with things going wrong) than the suspenseful French equivalent.Elizabeth Banks as Lara looks small, dowdy and vulnerable throughout most of the movie, and is becoming an actress who impresses me with each role she takes - she has a huge range.Russell Crowe's John isn't a vast amount different from several po-faced contemporary city-dwellers he has offered recently.But there is a moment, relatively dialogue-free, between Crowe and Brian Dennehy playing his father, which is worth the price of admission on its own.",The Next Three Days
14,ferguson-6,Lara's Theme,5,20 November 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Paul Haggis, Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson? Count me in! Oh wait, you mean there is more to making a quality movie than just gathering together a bunch of talented people? Well if you need proof ...Maybe my expectations were too high. Paul Haggis has proved himself to be a remarkable writer (Crash, Million Dollar Baby) and an excellent director (Crash, In the Valley of Elah). Russell Crowe is one of the finest actors working. Elizabeth Banks is a stunning talent - both highly comedic and full of range. Liam Neeson adds a touch of class to every film he is in (this one's no exception). The film is watchable, but such a stretch from the real world.The best part of the film is the scene with Crowe and Neeson. Neeson's character has escaped from SEVEN prisons and Crowe needs some tips so he can bust out his wife (Banks) who has been wrongly (maybe, maybe not) convicted of murder. The scene plays awfully close to an infomercial on ""How to Break out of Prison"" hosted by Liam Neeson. OK, I didn't say the scene was believable, just the best in the film. Try not to wonder how a guy that breaks out of prison SEVEN times (and finally surrenders because he is tired of looking over his shoulder) is actually a free man able to meet Crowe for coffee.What I am most disappointed in is the manner in which Crowe's college professor frump of a man transforms into an action figure after meeting with Neeson and getting his rear end kicked trying to buy fake ID's. Suddenly he is out-gunning drug dealers and driving the fastest ever Prius in reverse down a dark alley ... and then going head to head with strategy against some near clairvoyant detectives. Wow.Certainly not going to tell you if Crowe's plan actually works or if somehow he masters the art of flexibility while on the run. Whatever happens, I would have preferred him to remain true to his character early in the film. I totally get his frustration with the system and his desperation to free his wife - just not the quick transformation to modern day Gladiator.The supporting cast in the film is given very little to do. Olivia Wilde (thirteen from House) is wasted as the mother of a friend to Crowe's kid. Daniel Stern has one scene as Banks' attorney. RZA plays an unscrupulous drug dealer (redundant?). While it's great to see Brian Dennehy on screen as Crowe's father, it is unfortunate he is reduced to being near silent and all-knowing.The movie would make a fine diversion on one of those sleepless nights when it hits cable, but right now, I am just annoyed at the waste of talent and the lack of effort to make a better film.",The Next Three Days

16,anaconda-40658,Three Days Too Long.,4,13 January 2016,"The Next Three Days (2010): Dir: Paul Higgis / Cast: Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, Brian Dennehy, Olivia Wilde, Liam Neeson: Here is a film that had the ingredients of a decent action thriller but falls short mainly due too a cop out ending. The title means nothing since the so-called three days are never highlighted. Russell Crowe stars as a college professor whose wife is suddenly in prison for murder. With all evidence against her they lose any appeals. After three years and an attempted suicide by his wife, Crowe seeks other resources that place him on the opposite side of the law. One element that director Paul Higgis does really well is to allow any attempts by Crowe to render escape for his wife to fail. Crowe is pushed to the limits of morality until a cross over that have viewers applauding when perhaps they should not. Elizabeth Banks as his wife is always a question as to her innocence but when we are given the results through a potential concluding flashback it feels more like a feel good get-out-of-jail-free card as oppose to a strong story point. Supporting roles are another issue in their lifeless delivery. Brian Dennehy as Crowe's father who suspects something is up, is never used enough. Then there is Olivia Wilde as the mother of a young girl his son meets on a play ground. Her appearance is quite insignificant and mainly a filler. Liam Neeson plays someone who had broken out of prison and provides insight to Crowe on doing the same. With several well stage action scenes and a message regarding marriage partnership, perhaps day four should have been added to work on the script. Score: 4 ½ / 10",The Next Three Days
17,FlashCallahan,Why did this under-perform???,8,5 March 2011,"Crowe plays an everyday guy who has to live with the fact that his dad is Brian Dennehy. Aside from this, his wife has been banged up for life for moving a fire extinguisher and bumping into a running woman.Losing nearly everything to try and get her free, he turns to Hannibal from the A team for some help, and then his plan really comes together.....At the beginning of every year in the Uk, we are treated to a couple of decent films that are largely forgotten in the future. Defiance, Valkyrie, The Last Samurai to name a few, and this will be another one soon.It's a very well made film, and not having seen the original, i cannot compare it, but as a standalone movie, there are some fantastic performances, and Crowe hasn't been this god in a long time.The sheer desperation on his face more than makes up for the implausibility of some of the narration. He goes from mild mannered teacher, to drug den buster in a matter of scenes, gets all his research from video search engines (and they work!!), his dad doesn't mind that he will never see his grandson again. But these are only a few gripes in what otherwise is a solid thriller. Neeson is fantastic in his one scene, and then on it turns into a gripping thriller, which will have you on the edge of your seat. It gets quite tense in the final third, with the predictable lift chasing scene, which still works, no matter how many films has it portrayed.The ending, explaining to the audience what we already know, feels a little tacked on, but this is another good script from Haggis, who can get the most out of his stars and plot.Well worth watching.",The Next Three Days
18,gradyharp,A Showcase for Russell Crowe,8,14 March 2011,"Many have been wondering when Russell Crowe would make another film that lived up to his performance in 'A Beautiful Mind'. THE NEXT THREE DAYS may not have the quality of script of that previous success, but in this taut film Crowe once again reveals how completely involved in a character he can become. The film was written by Fred Cavayé, Guillaume Lemans, and writer/director Paul Haggis and the result is a story that while it may appear incredible to most, it is nonetheless an involving story of a man's love and commitment to his wife. John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is a schoolteacher who has a happy home life with his beautiful wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and son Luke (Ty Simpson). After a strange night out on the town the Brennan's return home to be met by policemen who arrest Lara for a murder she claims she did not commit. Jump three years and John has been working with lawyers, spending their paltry savings, on getting appeals to get Lara released from jail. He gets moral support from his parents (Helen Carey and Brian Dennehy) but sees his family falling apart. After three years have passed and when all legal portals fail, Lara attempts suicide and John decides the only way to get Lara out of prison is to aid in her escape. He visits writer Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson) who has escaped from prison several times and outlines the dangers AND the only secure methods for affecting a prison escape. John slowly and methodically prepares for the escape, gaining money by contacting drug lord Mouss (RZA), commits some crimes of his own as he masterminds his plan to successfully extract Lara from prison. There are many twists and turns to the story, well written subplots and unexpected coincidences, all populated with a very strong cast of capable actors. The real pleasure of watching this movie is to admire how totally committed Russell Crowe is to this role. It is a very fine performance - one of his most subtle and best. THE NEXT THREE DAYS is well worth watching. Grady Harp",The Next Three Days
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Next Three Days,8,25 November 2010,"Paul Haggis is a filmmaker whose body of works in the story / scriptwriting arena happens to be more prolific than that as a director, at the helm of films like the Oscar winning Crash (which was my favourite film of 2005) and In The Valley of Elah, while having story and scriptwriting duties in notable films like Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby and his WWII companion pieces Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima, and being involved with rebooting the James Bond franchise with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.The Next Three Days though is adapted from Pour Elle (Anything for Her), a 2008 French thriller by Fred Cavaye, based upon a story by Guillaume Lemans, which tells the tale of a high school teacher developing an all out plan to bust his wife out from jail. It's the same premise here with Russell Crowe as John Brennan leading what was a happy little life with wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and son Luke (twins Toby and Tyler Green as the toddler, and Ty Simpkins taking over the six year old role), before their routine gets rudely interrupted with the cops banging their door down and arresting Lara, with John getting caught offguard in similar fashion as Gerard Butler in Law Abiding Citizen.It's a tale of two halves as the first hour dwelled on John trying his best to work the legal angle for almost three years to defend and appeal his wife's sentence, before her suicide prompted him to walk on the other side of the law. Taking the cue and words of wisdom from Damon Pennington, played by Liam Neeson, that scene was perhaps the best within the first 60 minutes, as he briefs John on the clockwork fashion and insights on how the homeland security forces will work in an escaped convict situation. And it's not far fetched because this brings to mind the now famous incident from our own shores, with a terrorist having to escape from a detention centre through a combination of well thought out routines, and the exploitation of complacency created through those routines, and always being one step ahead in knowing the type of response met out every step of the way to aid in an escape.But before Prison Break can happen, part of the fun amongst the talk heavy first half, is to witness John's stumble as he hooks up with those in the illegal trade to obtain the necessary tools to aid in his mission. It's gritty stuff here that plays along with our imagination should we walk on the dark side - where and how do we begin, and the tremendous distrust issues. It's an instructional first hour reminding us how much information is readily available for research out there on the Internet, for those determined enough to try at all costs. For John, nothing matters other than to reclaim his family life and to reset three long years of futile waiting, and the sacrifices he goes through makes us question the same - just how much are we willing to lose, including our morality, for our loved ones?As expected and revealed in the trailers, those yearning for some action to happen will sit up during the second half, where it becomes The Fugitive for both John and Lara to escape from the pursuit of various security and the police force, and a scene I thought was paying homage to the Harrison Ford-Tommy Lee Jones movie was one where the pursued disappears amongst a procession. Some may balk at the unexpected pregnant pause as well where almost nothing is said when the husband and wife team sit out on a road shoulder, but I felt that the relatively quiet scene alone was screaming of a class treatment by Paul Haggis, a moment reflecting the sheer unbelievability of something intense that's pulled off, and a break necessitated by a conflict of objectives, and a hair-raising Some may find fault with a slew of coincidences found in the film, but with most movies, Fate has to lend a hand for the narrative to happen, and it's no different here, although again referencing the local escaped convict incident, stranger things have happened that may seem absurdly unbelievable, but they did, and Haggis does deal with some of these scenes, big and small, with a deft hand to heighten the tension and suspense, albeit a little bit cliché with you likely being able to guess the outcome.With Brian Dennehy and Olivia Wilde, who will be seen in TRON: Legacy coming out soon, their scenes are brief but provide that potential for sprawling subplots that didn't overstay their welcome. Olivia Wilde's single mother Nicole could have thrown a spanner in the works, but I suppose she's the counterbalance necessary to demonstrate just how dogged John is in his prime objective, and commitment for better or worse to his wife. An admirable effort from Paul Haggis, but given his pedigree, I have actually expected a lot more unfortunately. Still, it's a recommended and respectable prison break flick with Crowe once again reminding us that he's capable of playing ordinary characters bounded to extraordinary situations.",The Next Three Days
20,namashi_1,An Average Effort...,5,24 February 2011,"Paul Haggis directed 'The Next Three Days' is an average effort, that had the potential to come out as a tremendous watch. But, due to a erratic & stretched screenplay, the impact goes amiss.'The Next Three Days' tells the story of a married couple, whose lives go wary, when the wife is accused of a brutal murder.To give it's due, The idea is terrific & some sequences are genuinely gripping. But the pacing is inconsistent and the screenplay, as mentioned, is erratic & stretched. Paul Haggis directs this story well. Cinematography is perfect.Performance-Wise: Russell Crowe is in decent form. Elizabeth Banks is good. Liam Nesson is alright in a brief role. Brian Dennehy is just right. Olivia Wilde is wasted.

21,JamesHitchcock,A Moral Void,5,20 September 2013,"John and Lara Brennan, he a teacher, she a dentist, and their young son Luke are your typical idealised all-American middle-class family, so perfect they could be refugees from a cornflakes ad. And when you see an idealised all-American middle-class family in a thriller, you just know that disaster is just around the corner. And so it proves. Lara is arrested and accused of murdering her boss. John, of course, believes passionately in her innocence. Now at this point the audience probably know- or think they know- what sort of film this is turning into. It will be a courtroom thriller which will end with Lara triumphantly vindicated, probably through the efforts of a brilliant lawyer, the family reunited and the real killer exposed. Only ""The Next Three Days"" isn't a film of that sort. We see nothing of Lara's trial, but the next thing we know she has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, her appeal has been dismissed, and her less-than-brilliant lawyer is advising her husband to forget about any possibility of taking the matter to the Supreme Court. John then starts to consider an alternative solution, namely that of rescuing his wife from prison and fleeing with her to a foreign country. The film then describes how he goes about doing just that. Russell Crowe is one of those actors- the late Charlton Heston was possibly another- who generally seems at his best when starring in a period drama. The period in question can be anything from Ancient Rome (""Gladiator"") to mid-twentieth century America (""LA Confidential"", ""A Beautiful Mind""), via mediaeval England (""Robin Hood""), the Napoleonic Wars (""Master and Commander""), nineteenth century France (""Les Miserables"") and the Old West (""3.10 to  Yuma""). In anything contemporary (""Proof of Life"", ""A Good Year"") he seems for some reason less effective, and this is another modern-day film in which he doesn't really shine. Elizabeth Banks has surprisingly little to do as Lara, but there is a good cameo from Liam Neeson as Damon Pennington, a former convict whom John consults about the best way of escaping from prison and avoiding recapture after the escape. The first half of the film is rather slow-moving, although it does liven up towards the end when John and Lara are actually trying to pull off their crazily daring escape through the streets of Pittsburgh, pursued by a police officer with an almost supernatural ability to pre-empt their every move even though he only has the flimsiest of evidence at his disposal. The one thing with which the film does not overly concern itself is the question of Lara's guilt or innocence. This question is answered in a postscript at the very end of the film, but for most of its length Haggis proceeds on the unspoken assumption that John would be justified in trying to free Lara even if she were guilty of the crime. This means that there is something of a moral void at the heart of the film, a void which becomes most apparent in the scene where John, in order to obtain the money he will need when on the run, robs a drug dealer. Although two people are shot dead in the course of this robbery, nothing much is made of this, as though the deaths of two people were a price well worth paying in order to secure the heroine's freedom. Or perhaps the morality here is that of the ""Death Wish"" type vigilante thriller, namely that drug dealers are so morally worthless that killing them without due process of law is entirely justifiable, even praiseworthy. Paul Haggis greatly impressed me with ""Crash"", only his second feature film as director, and I was one of those who supported the Academy's decision to award it the ""Best Picture"" Oscar ahead of the dull and over-rated ""Brokeback Mountain"". ""The Next Three Days"", however, came as something of a disappointment to me. My opinion would be similar to that of Roger Ebert, who called it ""not a bad movie, just somewhat of a waste of the talent involved."" I was certainly expecting something better from this director and this star. 5/10",The Next Three Days
22,lasttimeisaw,The Next Three Days: 6/10,6,14 June 2011,"A remake of a comparatively recent French film Pour elle (2008), stars Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger, Hollywood acutely smelled the commercial potential of the original piece, under the wielder Oscar-winning director and writer Paul Haggins (noted for the notorious winning of CRASH over BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in 2006), teamed up with a Hollywood A-list star Russell Crowe (who is arguably deserving the title now though), in a well-qualified role as a reckless husband conspires a flawless getaway to rescue his innocent murderer-accused wife from jail and with their young son altogether, then escape to another country. Sounds a tad far-fetched, but this time Crowe is more closer to an ordinary human being than the stereotyped hero image in which he is seamlessly adept. This more closer-to-life penchant cleverly intrigues a high-profile bulk of curiosity than the corny one-man-save-the-world cliché cause we might harbor an illusion that this super-unattainable adventure could occur to the average Joe.A smart premise, but the film itself founders eventually as this so-called intricately designed plan actually can not offer plausible expositions other than conspicuous coincidences (for instance, the last moment permission to pass the airport visa checking; a fake health report just one day before the prisoner being transferred to another prison. I'm not saying coincidences are forbidden, just if there are too many, explicitly they are changing into a metaphorical insult to the audience's IQ), which all cause the spider-web of the rescue naively under-developed.The Detroit setting is enveloping in a depressive dark hue, establishes the film to a more disturbing empathy to allure audience to eureka when the ultimate catharsis comes, we could hail the repressing halo away, regrettably judging by which, the outcome is only half- exerted.The cast is just above average, no big surprises other than that Elizabeth Banks surely looks fabulous as a female prisoner in confinement for almost three years, good work, Paul!",The Next Three Days

Sure it the movie drags during few scenes, but overall it was a pretty good movie that almost anyone can enjoy. It's one of those films that won't make a huge hit at the box office or anything like that, in fact it quickly ended up in a dollar theater where I watched it. And for a price of admission being only 75 cents on Tuesday, it was worth every penny and for the most part found it entertaining although a bit generic and predictable at times. None of the actors really stood out in this, but they all did their jobs well. Just not outstanding to the point it stood out. The plot is also good, even if it can get a bit dull and slow sometimes. Overall it's a decent thriller that is worth checking out.7.3/10",The Next Three Days
25,Hellmant,Haggis in action mode!,7,23 November 2010,"'THE NEXT THREE DAYS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Two time Academy Award winner Paul Haggis (Best screenplay winner for 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' in 2004 and 'CRASH', one of my all time favorite films, in 2005) writes and directs this prison break film starring Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks. It's a remake of the 2008 french film 'ANYTHING FOR HER' starring Vincent London and Diane Kruger. The film is very dark, depressing and gritty at times but it's also pretty implausible and cheesy at times as well. It kind of switches gears between dark drama and action thrill ride multiple times. A lot of critics are saying it doesn't live up to the standard Haggis has set for himself; the man also co-wrote 'LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA' and 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' as well as wrote and directed 'IN THE VALLEY OF ELAH' and directed 'CRASH'. He's also the only screenwriter in history to write two back to back Oscar best film winners ('CRASH' and 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY') but he also co-wrote the Bond films 'CASINO ROYALE' and 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE', so he's known for doing brainless action as well. I found the film to be pretty entertaining but if you go into it looking for something like 'CRASH' or 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' you're going to be disappointed (Although personally I'm not the biggest fan of 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY').The film tells the story of a woman named Lara Brennan (Banks) who is accused of murder and sentenced to twenty years in prison. Crowe plays her teacher husband, John Brennan, who knows in his heart she is innocent besides a substantial amount of circumstantial evidence indicating otherwise. After appeals fail and all legal measures are exhausted John decides he's going to break his wife out of prison. He seeks the advice of an ex-con (played by Liam Neeson) who has escaped from prison seven times and embarks on a dangerous mission to raise a great deal of money and everything else he needs for the perfect prison break and life abroad after. By doing so he puts not only himself at risk but his young son Luke (Ty Simpkins) and the whole time it's unclear to the viewer whether his wife is in fact innocent.Russell Crowe is one of Hollywood's finest actors (his chameleon like abilities to transform himself from one role to another is hard to match) and his performance in this film lives up to his standards, not one of his best but not disappointing either. Banks continues to prove herself as an effective and adequate leading lady and the rest of the cast does a decent enough job as well (Neeson, like always, shines in his cameo). The story is intriguing and involving and despite the movie's flaws it works. While it's not nearly one of Haggis's most impressive writing jobs his directing is impressive; the action packed third act is breathtaking. Obviously this will not be an award contender in any way come awards time but it is an entertaining thrill ride.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=003J1CrnYDk",The Next Three Days
26,thesar-2,What Are You Doing for The Next Three Days?,9,13 July 2013,"I watched The Next Three Days many moons ago, probably a couple of years and it was one of those movies I instantly gave 5/5 stars. And I loved it so much I bought it after only that one viewing several years back on BluRay once on sale a couple of months ago.With only my second viewing, now on BluRay, of course, I still love it tremendously, though it just barely inched – and I mean minutely – down to 4½/5 stars. That's not to say there was a lot wrong with it; it's still a fantastic film that I believe many have never heard of. Too bad.I guess one thing that irked me when watching, and this might very well be my player settings, is the dialogue's sound is very low. I constantly had to turn up the volume to hear the lines and immediately reduce volume for an exciting scene that follows. (This was so not to disturb the other member of the household.) Again, that might not be the film's fault, perhaps my BluRay settings, but still it was annoying, especially when the dialogue here is so rich. Namely from Russell Crowe's John Brennan character.Both ""John"" and Russell make up a big chunk of why I loved this film. The premise is great, the score, cinematography, secondary characters, acting and, as stated, the dialogue are all so very nice too, but the acting and character from Russell was so splendid, I can't wait to see this again for a third time.John's wife Lara is accused of murdering her boss and arrested. John loves Lara more than his own life oranything. Period. (Words don't need to state this; Crowe absolutely shows this with every second he's on screen.) He does not believe she committed murder and fights tooth and nail to appeal and appeal all the way up to right before the Supreme Court. There, he hits a road block and finds no other way to set her free than to break her out.While I loved the movie up to this point tremendously anyways, this is where the movie elevates even more. We need to put ourselves into John's shoes. Given most of us are not gifted with prison break or law-breaking qualities, we journey right alongside complete amateur John and how he has ups and downs with his quest to learn how to not only break someone out of prison, but even how to shoot a gun. Oh, and ""ups and downs"" is putting it very mildly.John learns. John raises money, plots and asks the right questions. But he fails, and fails hard at spots.This movie couldn't be more realistic in what would happen if some layperson so biased and narrow-sighted would try and break someone out of jail. Granted, and I think this fits slightly in my drop from 5 to 4½ star rating, there were a few coincidences and way-out there moments that I barely bought. Nevertheless, the movie is suspenseful from the beginning to the end and you're right there with John the whole time.This movie is so incredibly rich and enjoyable, it never once crosses your mind that breaking someone out of prison is wrong.If you have not seen this, you should absolutely get your hands on it. Crowe's performance (and, again, character) should be enough to make you love this. I rarely suggest buying a movie, on any format, without seeing it. This is one of those.And then, trust me: you'll want to see it many more times over The Next Three Days.",The Next Three Days
27,Lejink,Not so great escape.,3,5 August 2012,"Despite its heavyweight credentials, with Paul Haggis directing and Russell Crowe starring, this was an impossibly improbable and far-fetched movie which I found myself unable to warm to. For me it too obviously tries to cash in on the ""justified vigilantism"" of movies like the Bourne trilogy or more recently Liam Neeson's ""Taken"" vehicle (with ironically Neeson himself getting a cameo role here as Crowe's inspiration for his plan to spring his wife from jail) and overdoes the manipulation of the audience's emotions along the way.Sure, I'd be upset if my wife was incarcerated for a murder she didn't commit, but to believe that a scholarly man could be driven to plan and execute a break-out from a top-security prison, committing murder along the way (but his victims are only drug-dealing scum so that's okay) and devising a meticulously complicated smokescreen operation to ward off the pursuing police beggars belief.Too many of the supporting parts are sketchily written, like Crowe's brother, the attractive single parent who finds him attractive and unwittingly plays a part in his master-plan and the numerous detectives who improbably end up second-guessing his every move but of course, just after he's made it.Unusually for a Bond director, scenes of true action and suspense are few and far between, apart from when Elizabeth Franks as his wife in despair attempts to throw herself from his car and if I've seen one cute-as-pie mop-haired infant foisted on me for over-sentimental reasons, I've seen a dozen, so you can tell I found little to crow (ouch!) about here.Flawed in construction, poorly executed and not outstandingly acted, this overlong so-called thriller failed to make a big impression on me.",The Next Three Days
28,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Hollywood goes and stamps it's uninspired foot-print all over another foreign original,4,31 May 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A re-make of a recent French thriller, involving a man called John Brennan (Russell Crowe), an English teacher whose wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is suddenly arrested on suspicion of murdering her boss. She goes on to be convicted of the crime and, when her final appeal fails, she becomes suicidal. Seeing no other way out, John begins to plot an elaborate escape plan that will require all his cunning.It's weird (and a little ironic) that I would probably have enjoyed The Next Three Days more if I hadn't seen the original (and especially so recently) and probably wouldn't have enjoyed films like Insomnia and The Vanishing so much if I'd seen the original foreign versions of those first. For that is the category the film falls snap bang into, that of being a glossy Hollywood re-make of a smaller budget European production (which they seem to love doing, even more so in these recessionary times) that doesn't have the luxury of the last two films I mentioned. And as so, I am only left to gawp at how shallow and inferior it feels to it's inspirational source, despite the best efforts of lead star Crowe to inject it with some gravitas and dynamism. A fine actor, he is left to carry a lot of the film on his own, while co stars including Liam Neeson as 'the man with the plan' and Brit star Lennie James get very minor, secondary roles.It's certainly slick and glossy enough, but director Paul Haggis can't infuse it with the same sort of gripping intensity that he did with his superior In the Valley of Elah. Fundamentally, the film's doing nothing wrong, pacing the story appropriately and generating the right degree of tension and suspense in the right doses. The trouble is, it plays out in exactly the same manner and style as the original and there's nothing you see in this that you couldn't see in the original. And why should you let the Hollywood cookie cutter machine dazzle you with it's glitzy lights when foreign, independent cinema could offer you something much more original and inspired? **",The Next Three Days
29,bowmanblue,Solid little thriller,7,20 July 2019,"Sometimes you gets films that aren't exactly 'classics,' yet aren't bad either. 'The Next Three Days' is one of those. You could call it 'average,' but that would make it sound like it's just run-of-the-mill and not worth your time. I probably wouldn't invest paying full-price for a cinema ticket in Imax surround-sound 3D to watch it, but if you can find it on some sort of online streaming service, then it's definitely worth adding to your 'watchlist.'Russell Crowe ditches his typical 'tough guy' routine to play a husband/father whose wife is convicted of murder and sent to prison. Being the loving husband, he totally believes in her innocence 100% and, despite the wealth of evidence supporting her conviction, decides that the only way of getting her out is - literally - by breaking her out of jail and going on the run.That's the general premise of the film, but I won't go into too much detail as there's quite a few twists and turns where you'll wonder whether things are going to work out or not.The film isn't that short and therefore can spend a lot of time looking into the pros and cons of this course of action. Despite the film's length it never feels slow (definitely a bonus!) and there's plenty of adversity for a father to face when he decides to embark on this new life 'on the lam.'There's certainly nothing negative I can really say about the film. All the performances are solid, as is the whole execution. However, it's just not one of those films that's worth paying 'full price' for. Once upon a time you could use the phrase 'rent, don't buy,' but, seeing as no one really rents anything any more, I guess the phrase should be 'stream, don't buy.' Plus, you get a cameo from Lian Neeson, playing a rare character than doesn't kill half the cast!",The Next Three Days
30,dromasca,a grain of ambiguity saves The Next Three Days,6,9 May 2012,"I had many reasons to be unhappy with this film, yet I ended by being reasonably satisfied with my action movie selection. So what makes The Next Three Days work? It starts as a happy_family_meets_hell film, flirts shortly with the court drama, then it turns into a reversed version of Convinction, with Russell Crowe playing the role of Hilary Swank . Then the last third is pure action, with very little credibility, as the way the hero tries get his innocent (maybe) wife out of prison is traditional escape and not decades of fight within the legal system.Sure, Russell Crowe is a good actor, Elizabeth Banks is not bad either, and director Paul Haggis already proofed in a couple of (better) films that he knows how to build characters and a compelling story around them. Yet, this film has all the chances to run into routine, there is nothing new or unexpected in its story line.I believe that what saves The Next Three Days from failing is that the script and the director left in the story and the way it is told some ambiguity. We never know whether the woman is really innocent, the flashbacks are there not to clarify but to murk what really happened the night of the crime that triggered the events. Even if we assume (as the husband does) that the woman is innocent the act of escaping justice (and so many good cops chasing the couple and their kid) leaves viewers with a sense of morality in quite an uncomfortable solution. Director Haggis did not have a brilliant script at hand from screenplay writer Haggis. So he put into the direction a grain of uncertainty that is more realistic than all the rest of the story and saves the film. Because life itself has a grain of uncertainty.",The Next Three Days

He learns the routine of the delivery man and even about bump keys, which almost gets him caught. He comes up with a smart plan to get the cops to move his wife and then he does the rest. He is also able to take their son with them, which was a close call because the plan deviates from what he expected.FINAL VERDICT: It is very slow in the beginning and about 20 to 30 minutes could have been edited out.

This film is not as tense or emotional-provoking as Crash but it still displays those elements very effectively.This film is about a schoolteacher who after trying to use legal means to get his wife out of prison and fails, he begins to use criminal methods to save his wife from life in prison in a race against time.Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks gives all they got in this film and it works. They had great chemistry and all their emotions were just genuine. When these emotions are genuine, that is when I know the acting is great.Overall, this is a solid, above-average thriller that keeps the tension bar at the highest levels for the entire film.

It starts off a little slow, but once John's plan is put into action it becomes a very fast paced action movie that you won't be able to stop watching. Much like he did in ""Crash"" the director (Paul Haggis) is great at dragging out a 5 sec scenario that makes you second guess yourself three and four times before the result is shown. That makes for a very fun film to watch. This is an excellent action-thriller (that's saying a lot since I'm not a Russel Crowe fan at all) that will not let you down. Rent it!

35,atlasmb,A Blue Collar Love Story Drama,6,18 November 2013,"Perhaps because it was shot in and around Pittsburgh, The Next Three Days has a blue collar feel to it. I like the film, though I do have some issues with it. My first issue has to do with Russell Crowe. He portrays a married man who finds himself involved in a terrible circumstance--his wife is accused of murder and there is little he can do to help her. Jimmy Stewart made a reputation playing these roles, and as an ""everyman"" the viewer could relate to, he was the best. For some reason, Crowe does not feel like an everyman to me in this film.When Crowe feels his life and his family have been torn apart (unjustifiably, he feels), he decides he must try to break his wife out of jail. So the film becomes a ""prison escape story"", but this one is from an outside POV; his wife is not aware of his plan. So, the feel of the film is more like a ""bank heist story"", with the details painstakingly planned. And like those stories, the audience wonders (and stresses) about that one small detail that might abort the entire plan. In this sense, its also like a ""planning the perfect murder story"". There are so many things that could go wrong.As I said, I enjoyed this film, but--as so many reviewers have pointed out in their comments--the plot contains some errors and many coincidences, which detract from the film.I can't fault the narrative, which plays out in a non-chronological fashion. It holds back just enough of the story to keep it even more interesting. During the film, the viewer wonders if the wife might possibly have been guilty. And surely, there must be one scintilla of doubt in the husband's mind? But no, he is Don Quixote, the knight driven to fight for a noble cause, having faith in the innocence of his beloved. The question is will she find within herself the same faith in him?Despite the story's implausibilities, I recommend the film--especially if you are a fan of Crowe or Elizabeth Banks.",The Next Three Days

The preposterous plot essentially shows the transformation of a mild-mannered professor into James Bond. Crowe's exploits and the efficient police response are both ridiculously contrived. It's all quite silly and gets sillier as it progresses, but manages to be mostly entertaining.

37,zkonedog,How Movies Should Be Made,8,10 March 2017,"Let's face it: in today's Hollywood, far too many movies are produced to strictly be cash cows, ""popcorn flicks"", or strictly vehicles for rising stars. While there is nothing wrong with that formula from a business point of view, it does serve to clutter/bog down the cinemas with largely irreverent fare. Fortunately, ""The Next Three Days"" is a shining example of how a film SHOULD be made.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the Brennan family. When wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) is imprisoned for 20 years on a murder charge (her guilt/innocence is unknown until later on in the movie), husband John (Russell Crowe) hatches a scheme to break her out and take their son Luke out of the country to start a new life together. Along the way, John Brennan gets advice from a former prison escapee (Liam Neeson), must piece together a plan, and then finally decide if he deems himself capable of pulling it off.This movie will not immediately jump to the top of your ""all-time favorites"" list. What it will do, however, is entertain you for 2+ hours with intriguing characters, an interesting storyline, and enough plot twists to keep you guessing. It's simple (yet cognitive) entertainment at its finest: sit back, immerse yourself, and stay along for the satisfying ride.Besides the immersive storyline, the acting is also an ""added bonus"". Crowe and Banks are quite capable of carrying the leading roles, while Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Daniel Stern & even Brian Dennehy have excellent supporting roles, as small as they may be. Very much reminiscent of earlier Crowe films like ""The Insider"" & ""State of Play"" where the ""surround Crowe with auxiliary talent"" formula also paid off big.Thus, ""The Next Three Days"" is a very entertaining film (though perhaps not an outright classic) that I wish more Hollywood studios would copy. The acting is great, the plot is exciting, and the pacing is excellent. You'll never be looking at the DVD timer to see how much is left, that is for sure.",The Next Three Days

Not taking it lying down Brennan who's sure that she's innocent plans to spring Lara from the joint, or jail, and take off with her and their son Luke, Ty Simpkins, to South or Central America to avoid capture. Before Brennan pulls all this off he heads up to this sleazy bar in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, from his home in Pittsburgh, to get professional advise from jail brake expert Damon Pennington played in a cameo role, where he didn't have enough screen time to kill anyone, Hollywood #1 Macho Man Liam Neeson.

What comes as a both surprise as well as happy ending is that it's revealed, in a very confusing flash-back, who really murdered Elizabeth Gesas, remember her, who by then was totally forgotten about in all the action leading up to it.

39,TheMovieDiorama,The Next Three Days sluggishly counts down to its thrilling prison break whilst grounded by semi-realism.,6,27 February 2020,"After a tranquil night out, you wake up the next morning preparing breakfast for your child and spouse. Exercising a typical suburban daily routine. *knock knock*. Someone's at the door. With a jolly grin, you open the entrance, only to be greeted by a barrage of police officials equipped with a warrant to search your property. Your spouse, washing a suspicious red stain from their jacket, is arrested for the murder of their boss. With no evidence to support their claims, and you restlessly staying up every night in search for potential answers, they're sentenced to life in prison. You believe, despite the substantial evidence, that their innocent and wrongly accused. You trust them. You love them.Given the above hypothetical situation, Haggis' remake of the French thriller 'Pour Elle' asks the fundamental question: ""What would you do?"". This deluge of direct address solidifies an upsurge of participation from the viewer, as they witness a wholesome family endure fragmentation. Whether it be John browsing search engines in an attempt to find tutorials on breaking into cars with a tennis ball or producing ""bump keys"" to pick locks. Haggis grounds this ordeal in a fragile layer of realism by ensuring each character has a moral compass. John in particular, whom is a college English teacher, backs away from several scenarios indicating a higher level of morality. He isn't a hero who can take on the entire Pittsburgh police force. He isn't a criminal. He is human. An obsessed ordinary being who loves his wife so very dearly. There's a palpable motive behind John that strives for relatability.Unfortunately though, John is marred with substantial flaws that prevent emotional investment. The largest impact being the complete disregard for his son. As a father, no matter the circumstance, his responsibility is for his son. To risk Luke's childhood with no parents, in the event that John is caught breaking Lara out of prison, is unprincipled. Haggis rarely explored this ethical conflict within John, settling to illustrate a convoluted, implausible and meticulous prison break plan instead. Yet it's anchored by plot conveniences and coincidences that disguise a chaotic intention as a seamless scheme.It juxtaposes the destructive obsession that John experiences, as he subconsciously injures the people surrounding him. Accidentally reversing into a shopper. Enduring a shoot out. But, most importantly, his son. Haggis' conclusion, whilst matching the original's ending, lacked satisfaction. Personally, it's a weak climax that purposefully contrasts the speech delivered by Neeson at the start of the feature. Crowe and Banks however deliver engrossing performances throughout that solidify a mild entertainment factor within The Next Three Days, although Wilde was criminally underused.Approximately mid-way through this thriller, John and his class of eager students discuss Don Quixote. A romanticised conceptualisation of sacrificing one's self for love. Amorous, yet an impractical gesture. That, essentially, sums up The Next Three Days. Romantic, yet unreasonable.",The Next Three Days

"" The writer and director of this story is Paul Huggis and I must say, he's done an exceptional job. The main star of the movie is none other than Russel Crowe and boy did he bring to life the character John Brennan. John's wife played by Elizabeth Banks is arrested, tried and convicted of murder and will spend the rest of her life behind bars. However, after exhausting all legal avenues, he seeks out ex-convict, turned novelist Damon Pennington (Lian Neeson) to learn how someone can escape from the most secure prisons. Following his advice, John spends the next three years planning his wife's escape. However, the police are put on his trail, when John tries to use a forged key and fails. The beginning of the film does test an audience's patience, but it more than makes up with a sobering dramatic story and exciting, tense chase scenes. One questions arises though, with the use of exceptional actors like Brian Dennehy and Liam Neeson in nearly cameo roles.

43,freemantle_uk,A decent thriller,8,2 January 2011,"Paul Haggis is one of the most talented writers in Hollywood, having made films like Million Dollar Baby, Crash, Letters from Iwo Jima and the new Bond films. His latest film is a remake of the French film, Anything for Her with an all-star cast.John Brennan (Russell Crowe) is a typical family man and an English lecturer whom world is turned upside-down after his wife is a sentence for murder for 20-years. After all routes of appeal are exhorted his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) attempts to commit suicide. Knowing his wife can not survive in prison John plans her escape from prison and to a foreign country. He does everything he can think of, including buying fake documents, photographing the prison to find any weak links, sell his house and research every technique he needs to help his wife. But he has to explore his own dark side to achieve it.Haggis is an excellent writer because his stories and characters are all thought out. He attempts to make his films realistic and one of the aspects I liked about is how John sets about planning the escape plan: from asking drug dealers for ID papers and researching youtube videos. The main two characters are well rounded and developed, particularly Crowe who is in very man mode: he is a character who turns from a ordinary man who wanted to do things through the system who turns into a criminal. The cops are the main antagonists, but they are just made out to be ordinary cops just doing their jobs, not corrupt or evil people. There are some really unlikely events like when a man goes to John's house and offers to make him documents (who is deaf for no real reason), and has contradictory intelligence (sometimes smart, sometimes dumb). An problem is how John can act so calmly with the police on his back, know exactly what they would do and coming up with ways to avoid them: much of it relies on luck. Some of the pacing is a little slow and about 10 to 15 minutes could have been cut. But these problems are not disastrous and Haggis does deliver a fun thriller.The acting in the film is good. As already mention Crowe give a good performance (his American accent is better then his English one). He worked well with Banks and she gave a strong performance. It is made even better because she is know for being a comic actress and she shows she has other acting skills. Hopefully she will get to get to test her range even more. Most of the supporting did a decent job, but the did not have much to do. Liam Neeson was in the film but his role is just a cameo, feeling like he thought he had a couple of days free and that the role was easy money.On a final note, Danny Elfman gives the film an intense score which really added to the tension within the film.7.5 out of 10.",The Next Three Days
44,dfranzen70,"Earnest, but there isn't much you haven't seen before",7,29 October 2011,"A community-college professor, convinced that his incarcerated wife is innocent of murder, concocts a scheme to bust her out. He has no experience in, well, anything – a true antihero if there ever was one. Is there any doubt that he can pull it off? Did I mention that the professor is played with the usual subtle charm and grim determination of Russell Crowe? No matter who the man plays, he has this quiet intensity such that you expect him to simply exploded with emotion at any moment. But that's part of what makes him a great actor. The same guy who can cry havoc in movies like Robin Hood and Gladiator can dial it down to the point where he's almost whispering his grim determination, like in A Beautiful Mind. It's sort of the same here. Even so, The Next Three Days is not a complete success, and I think it's mainly because it all seems a little too neat and tidy; its implausibility just sinks it.John (Crowe) and Lara (Elizabeth Banks) are the parents of a young boy. One morning, the police burst in and arrest Lara on the spot for the murder of her boss, with whom she'd had an argument the day before. Next thing we all know, a guilty verdict is rendered, and Lara is sentenced to a long stretch in the pen.We are expected to believe that Lara is innocent. But during the first hour or so of the movie, the focus shifts – it's not about what happened the night of the murder, it's what's going to happen, such as how John will react. What's his plan? What's his angle? Does he, in fact, believe in his wife's innocence?From that point on, we're treated to a virtual montage of Planning. Often in movies like this, the protagonist will gather a bunch of friends and acquaintances and assign each a task – distract the guard, cut the concertina wire, flash bomb in the cafeteria, and so on – and then things go wrong. Disguises are involved in the subterfuge as well. But not this time. This is John's game. He does enlist the advice of a career criminal who's escaped from prison several times (Liam Neeson, in a very, very small role), but for the most part John uses his community- school-teaching skills to figure stuff out. Oh, and the Internet, which teaches him about how to make a ""bump key"" and other fun facts.The characters are believable, even if the plot sometimes is not. Although Lara is in prison for a long time, it's tough to tell how much time passes before John can implement his daring plan. Months? Years? He doesn't seem to age a bit – and neither does his young son, for that matter. So if it's a matter of months, he sure learns a lot in a short amount of time. Kind of gives you the impression that if you study something really hard over a short time frame, you'll grasp all of the intricacies and be prepared to address previously unforeseen problems. Uh huh.Crowe himself is engaging as always, so if you're a fan there's no reason not to watch this. Banks – whose hair changes from bright blonde to dark black in prison in a blink of an eye, and I'm still not sure why – is good but could have been replaced by any number of actresses, like Naomi Watts or Tea Leoni or Maria Bello. She's window dressing, there to provide a counterbalance to that ever-present grim determination of Crowe's John Brennan.So it's all about Russell Crowe Doing the Right Thing, and even halfway through the movie you get a strong sense of how it'll all end up. He's the hero, the system is the bad guy, and that's about it. There are some decent action scenes, as well as some fine detective work, but little to really separate the movie from other break-'em-out flicks.",The Next Three Days

The movie has an interesting story, strong acting and excellent cinematography. Perhaps the plot is somewhat far-fetched but so what? It's a movie. The best part of this movie are not the stars but the supporting cast. Most impressive was the performance by Lennie James who definitely deserves formal recognition for his work in this movie. So strong is his performance that I this movie could easily be retitled ""The Pursuit"" without misleading the audience. Both Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks give strong performances and Brian Dennehy once again proves how great he is as an actor. At times the story does stretch the boundaries of plausibility but never to the point that the story is rendered ridiculous. In this movie there are no bad guys. Rather it dramatizes a justice system that at times may not get it right and how frustration and indignation can lead one to commit acts of desperation.",The Next Three Days
46,alindsay-al,An above average thriller that I enjoyed,6,31 August 2015,"Russel crowe is one of the most recognisable names in Hollywood so I'm interested in anything he is in and I thought this was an alright film. The premise sees a school teacher try and break his wife out of prison and reunite his family. Now this movie only works because of the fantastic performance from russel crowe. He is a truly damaged character who just wants to have his family and his old life back and he will do anything to get it. You root for him but at the same time realise that maybe he is going to far. Elizabeth banks was good as his wife and there was allot of intrigue about the character and their chemistry worked for me. The kid was also pretty good in this movie. There are quite a few characters in this movie that are pointless and unnecessary such as the cops, crowes parents and Olivia Wilde's character that dragged down the film. I like the premise of the story, it is really interesting and I also really like the character development that crowe has. But like I said before there are just too many pointless filler plot threads in this movie and also I think the ending could have been done in a better way. The script wasn't that interesting at all with the dialogue being the main weakness of the film and also some things that characters do comes across as illogical. The style was really cool, I loved the suspense in the film and the action scenes that happened were really cool too.

47,estebangonzalez10,One of the best thrillers of the year!,9,9 May 2011,"¨We spend a lot of time trying to organize the world. We build clocks and try to predict the weather. But what part of our life is truly under our control? ¨ Let me start out by saying that I absolutely loved this movie. It was one of the best films I've seen this year. This thriller had me at the edge of my seat for the entire second half of the movie. It was really intense and it had everything I look for in a thriller: it was suspenseful; it had good performances, interesting characters, and a smart script. Some critics argued that the length and pace of the film was to slow, but I thought The Next Three Days had a perfect pacing, steadily building the tension from the beginning to the highly climatic ending. Paul Haggis won two Oscars for his screenplays in Crash and Million Dollar Baby. He also adapted the screenplay for this film and directed it as well. He has written several other memorable screenplays like Casino Royale and In the Valley of Elah. I really enjoy his films and thought he should have received a lot more credit for this suspenseful thriller. He has proved to be a brilliant director and screenwriter. This film is actually a remake of a 2008 French film: Pour Elle (Anything for Her) which was directed by Fred Cavayé and stared Diane Kruger (Inglorious Basterds). I haven't seen that movie so I don't know how faithful this adaptation was, but I can say that this American version is really satisfying. I was a big fan of the TV series Prisonbreak (mainly the first season), and this movie reminded me a lot of that series.John (Russell Crowe) and Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) live an apparently happy married life along with their three year old son Luke in Pittsburgh. One morning the police storm in their house accusing Lara of murder. She had had a heavy argument with her boss the previous night and her body was found lifeless in the parking lot. Lara was seen leaving the scene of the crime by another co-worker and her fingerprints were all over the fire extinguisher, the murder weapon. They also found the victim's blood on her coat so all the evidence was against Lara. The movie jumps three years forward as John is working really hard with his lawyer to file for an appeal. John is convinced that her wife is innocent and is willing to fight for her freedom. He visits Lara at the Allegheny County jail regularly along with Luke (now played by Ty Simpkins) who doesn't speak to his mom. John keeps his wife updated with the case and she tells him that someone else was at the crime scene that night. She bumped into her in the garage and heard a button pop, but the police never found any evidence of it. All hope seemed to be lost, the appeal was rejected and Lara would have to spend 20 more years in prison. Lara doesn't want to spend the rest of her life in prison without being able to speak to her son so she tries to kill herself. John is not willing to leave her wife in prison for a crime he is convinced she didn't commit so he tries to figure out a plan to help her escape and so the action begins.Liam Neeson has a small role in this film as Damon Pennington, an ex-con who wrote a book on how to escape from jail. John meets with him and asks for advice on how he can free his wife. It's a small role but it is key because it sets the mood and suspense for the next hour. The beautiful Olivia Wilde also has a small role as the single mother of Nicole, one of Luke's playground friends. It's not a really important role, but it helps establish John's character in the film as a loving father and caring husband. He will do whatever it takes to free her wife and he doesn't even doubt her one bit. Russell Crowe is a great actor and he is brilliant in this film. He expresses so much without having to speak. The scene where he has to tell his wife that the appeal was rejected is heartbreaking. He doesn't have to say anything to her, she already see's it in his eyes. So does the rest of the family. As the movie carries on, the suspense begins to build more and more up to a very satisfying finale. The Next Three Days is one of the best thrillers I have seen in a while and the length of the film didn't bother me one bit because the movie was really intense. Paul Haggis should get more recognition for this movie than he has received because it was truly satisfying.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Next Three Days

Out of desperation to keep his family together, Crowe thinks up and executes a most elaborate scheme to spring his wife from jail and escape out of the country.Written and directed by the award-winning writer Paul Haggis (""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Crash""), this movie is a slow boil. The first half is very quiet. We do not really know what the wife did or not do right away. One scene she is arrested, then she is already in jail. The audience is kept thinking to piece things together as the scenes unfold, as details were not spoon-fed. Then as Crowe initiates his plot, the movie is transformed into an exciting, suspensefully-edited series of events. The scenes shift from Crowe to the police on his trail in an effectively nail-biting fashion. All the while at this point, we still do not know whether the wife was guilty or not. All we have is Crowe's faith in her innocence. The audience is kept in a moral dilemma. Will Crowe succeed to give his wife her freedom? Should we really root for them to escape? But ultimately the thing that brings this movie down for me is its preposterousness. Here we have Crowe who is a just mild-mannered professor in the beginning, not some special ops guy (like Liam Neeson in ""Taken"", who incidentally has a cameo here as the ex-con/escapee who generously advised Crowe). And mind you, this is supposed to be a prison in Pittsburgh, a major city of the United States, not one from any random Third World country. Can ordinary people like him, like us, really resort to these extreme measures outside the law in order to free someone you love from prison? OK, it is just a movie, but in family dramas like this, I believe some measure of believability and grounding in reality is necessary to make the audience care for the characters.",The Next Three Days
52,aharmas,"Tense and Entertaining, The Way They Used to Be...",9,5 December 2010,"Russell Crowe is a pretty reliable star, one who commands the screen with intelligence and enough bravado to get away with a film like this. Somehow, audiences and critics are getting more demanding and expect brainier and tighter story lines, but it's still plenty of fun to see a light, crazy ride like this... One where the hero is besieged by unfortunate circumstances and must one way or another succeed or die. With the help of Haggis' strong direction and a very good performance by Crow, we're treated to two hours of action, where one doesn't have to do a lot of thinking, just watching Crowe dodge bullet after bullet and cheer him along to the nail-biting end.The main reason the film works is Crowe gives it his best, scene after scene his eyes tells us his character is committed to his family, and he will stand by them no matter what. There is very little background given to us, except for an opening scene which serves the purpose of planting the seed of doubt in our minds, but this only helps fuel the sense of despair and sadness that threatens to destroy this family.Little by little, we follow Crowe's teacher, as he races against the clock to help his wife, and soon enough, he is dealing with the scum of society and an increasingly suspicious police force. Relationships with his family are tense at best, and any new relationships are threatened his wife's past. It's the attention to this intimate and personal moments that makes us care for him, even when he makes a couple of disturbing moves.One thing you won't be is bored, as the circle tightens, so that his quest might not get his desired results.

54,Samiam3,Three days too many,5,10 December 2011,"In France, The Next Three Days was released as 'Tout pour Elle' meaning 'Everything for Her'. What a beautiful title for a film about a man who spends three years coming up with a plan to get his wife out of jail, arrested for murder, and sentenced to life. If only the people were as romantic and appealing as a title like Tout pour Elle. Paul Haggis crafts a thriller about a husband and wife who don't seem to like each other let alone love each other. Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks fail to sell us believable emotional characters, leaving us with a story that is surprisingly distant, but thats only part of the problem.The Next Three Days is not constructed very well. The introduction feels rather rushed, and lacks exposition, and the middle section is long, unfocused and boring. The climax had some good energy and tension, but the events are beyond absurd, and by that point I had lost most of my investment in the film anyway. One of the things about the story which is annoying is that the context and details behind the arrest are never really explained. I really wanted to know why this happened, but I didn't find out until the last five minutes, where Haggis spells it out in a slightly tacky fashion. The Next Three Days might have been a better movie if it was about a man trying to prove his wife's innocence. Instead it's a long, slow jailbreak movie.Russell Crowe gives a rather confused performance. There is far to much understatement in the way he plays this individual, and He's too cold an actor to play the kind of family man that Haggis is trying to craft. I'm almost tempted to say it was a miss cast. Elizabeth Banks meanwhile is just plain bad. She is an emotional dud, and throughout the movie has this kind of look on her face that says 'I don't know what I'm doing'. The movie has its moments of power and suspense so I wont call it a complete failure, but it didn't do much for me. Fairly silly, and generally uninvolving, I just didn't find any reason to care for The Next Three Days.",The Next Three Days

It was a good choice. I enjoyed the way Paul Haggis portrayed and kept together the core family-members, and the acting and characters were fairly believable aside from Crowe's character. Crowe's acting is run-of-mill, and you'll have to suspend belief a little bit when thinking about his lack of common sense and street smarts (spoiler) as well as the strain on plausibility in his dealings with societal riff-raff. (spoiler) If you can fold up your doubt on the idea that Crowe's character could mastermind what takes place, I think you will, like me, enjoy the movie, particularly a stunning finale. For the record, I hated Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" with a passion, but this movie is world's better in terms of entertainment value and script. It's not perfect, but it works.

Russell Crowe usually does really well in thrillers, and Elizabeth Banks is one of those actresses that you just love to see on the screen. They're joined by Liam Neeson and Olivia Wilde in small (but appreciated) roles. Not a bad collection of actors, right? Crowe in particular gave a good performance that (thankfully) wiped his recent half-hearted turn as Robin Hood right out of my mind. The story is about an average guy who plots to break his wife out of prison, where she's serving time for a murder that he doesn't believe she committed. He's a community college teacher, not an expert on prison escapes, so a lot of The Next Three Days is spent with Crowe's character researching how he can accomplish his goal and trying to get passports, money, etc. It's only in the last 30 minutes when the plan is actually put into action, but the movie stays exciting and interesting throughout. I unfortunately haven't been able to check out the original French film, Pour Elle, so I can't compare quality between the two. Judged solely on its own merits, I thought The Next Three Days was a solid, tense, occasionally clever thriller. Nothing mind-blowing, but not many glaring flaws, either. There are a few moments when the move strays a little too far beyond believability (ex. super cops repeatedly making huge, unerring leaps of logic), but I still recommend it. Cool soundtrack, too. Who would have thought The Like would be featured in a big budget Hollywood flick?",The Next Three Days
57,bob-rutzel-1,Totally Engrossing,9,14 March 2011,"John Brennan's (Crowe) wife Lara (Banks) is found guilty of murder, but John believes in her innocence. All appeals fail and he is left with only one option: To break her out of jail. This should be good.And, it was, it was, it really was. A totally engrossing movie. A little long, but if you follow it closely you know John needs to cross all the T's and dot all the I's. And, if you are doing this faithfully, then it's not too long and you wish it were even longer. We are in the business of being entertained and we were, we were, we certainly were. You could say this was a Mission Impossible moment, but without the team, and the music, but you could hum it. However, the actual music throughout was excellent. Liam Neeson only has a cameo role - so don't get too excited - but his advice to John is the groundwork for all John does to break his wife out of jail. His dialogue is perhaps the best I have heard in a long time, mostly because it was totally convincing and honest and just listening to that voice, I believe I would be convinced that I could break someone out of jail. When the cat and mouse time comes you are on the edge of your seat going over all the things that could go wrong. The cops are pretty smart in flushing out the clues that lead to John; and you hope John has covered everything. Excellent cat and mouse and as John is rushing to beat his time table, you are there with him hoping he doesn't do something stupid, like driving too fast to call attention to himself. You like being part of a jail break, don't you? Is your dark side showing or is it your sincere sense of justice that gets you to help John? I guess we shall never know. Excellent performances all around. And, if you look closely sometimes you will see Elizabeth Banks (Lara) look like Hillary Swank and at other times like Olivia Wilde. You have to look quick. Or maybe it's just me. I have only one criticism and that is Russell Crowe still talks too low, but I will build a bridge and get over it. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",The Next Three Days
58,Luigi Di Pilla,Surprising thriller,7,25 September 2011,"I had some doubts before I bought the DVD but I was wrong. I enjoyed this movie for most of this dynamic and dramatic thriller. The story was built up slowly but got to a fast paced countdown. Therefore I missed some more elements about the prison escape plan but in the last third of the movie I have seen all the needed information. There were no unnecessary car chase, explosions or thousand-bullets firefight. This is an example how thrillers must be thank Paul Haggis. The running time could have been cut for 30 minutes. Russel Crowe delivered a great convincing character performance. This film was such intense that I couldn't sleep calm. I will add this DVD in my best of collection. Solid rating of 7,5/10.If you like this genre then watch THE FUGITIVE, THE RUNAWAY TRAIN or THE SHAwSHANK REDEMPTION.",The Next Three Days
59,valadas,A loving husband indeed,7,2 February 2011,"A middle class couple is quietly at home with their little son in the evening when suddenly police officers invade the house and arrest the wife charging her with the murder of her boss, another woman. Evidence is against her and she ends up by being convicted and getting a heavy prison sentence. We might think that the story will develop itself in order to prove if she is guilty or innocent. Not at all. You will only know that in the very end. Because what the movie shows us after she is definitely convicted are the efforts of her loving husband (Russell Crowe) to conceive and execute a plan to take her out of jail. These efforts know advances and retreats and include even some very violent scenes including an assault on him by drug dealers and some censurable killings he also does. Suddenly the wife gets a notice according to which she is going to be moved to a state prison in another state. This catches the husband by surprise and forces him to change plans and hurry up their execution. Then the last 30 minutes of the movie are really thrilling and full of suspense scenes which will keep you clung to your seat in great excitement. The action is really the most valuable feature of the movie since the story in itself is not very deep or original. But its development in images will keep you interested and emotionally attentive all the time.",The Next Three Days

A story which could have been told in impressive ½ hr. movie was stretched more than 2hrs. I'll honest; I'm fed up of watching Russell Crowe just like Nicolas Cage. On one hand where Nicolas Cage is making bad scripted big budget movies trash, Russell Crowe is making good stories mediocre. I can forgive him in Robin Hood, because I thought the movie was really good and I can surpass on Russell, though I still believed that if Robin Hood had any Fresh New Hero, it would have been a Critical & Box Office Success. Anyways, Just like State Of Play, Russell Crowe was the biggest mistake of this movie. He acts okay and never tries to take the role to next level. Simply he doesn't hard enough to prepare for the role. Here he was fat and has lost all his charisma. Plus the movie was unnecessarily long. There were many scenes which could have been easily cut on editing table. Elizabeth Banks did really well though she never got much scoop. Olivia Wilde gorgeous & wasted in insignificant role. Liam Neeson cameo ineffective. Overall, if you forget the length and surpass Russell Crowe, there is really good story beneath all this mess. So watch it for strictly time pass. Because once you start watching you really want to know what happens to her.",The Next Three Days

64,oneguyrambling,Consistent and serious adult drama - hardly a must see recommendation really...,6,24 September 2011,"I don't know what the Next Three Days in the film involved yet. But the opening scene details a ridiculous conversation held between John (Russell Crowe) his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks), John's brother and his partner that starts with Lara telling all present about an argument she had that day with her female boss. The ensuing dialogue is contrived and banal, and worse each comment lead to another over-reaction and rising tension.(Of course this results in John and Lara having an impromptu pash-sesh in the car on the way home, but that's not important.) The next morning as Lara preps for work while John attends to 5 year old Luke the door explodes open and Lara is summarily arrested for murder. The next few minutes are a bit of a blur but it is alleged (your Honour) that Lara offed her boss shortly prior to heading off to dinner, and all the evidence at hand supports that.The next couple years are fast forwarded, Lara is still imprisoned and it appears will be for a long while to come – as her lawyer tells John to more or less give up trying to prove her innocence. John on the other hand is Rusty Crowe, a man who has never given up on anything in any movie he has ever appeared in, so that won't be happening. He keeps looking at different and more extreme ways to allow the family to get back together. Luke, now 7, has grown more withdrawn from Lara despite frequent visits to prison to see her, and even Lara is pleading with John to let it all go and move on.When Lara decides to solve John's problems by killing herself, but fails, John formulates a more extreme plan after a discussion with an 'expert' played by Liam Neeson. Then he takes about 90 minutes of my life putting the thing into action, it's like they filmed the thing in real time.Going into detail regarding the ensuing events wouldn't be fair to the film but while in the main most of the events are vaguely plausible the sheer number of coincidences and luck required do stretch the friendship. I could actually forgive most of that if the pacing of the film wasn't so uneven. At times John spends several minutes on one small aspect of his plan, then suddenly the events of two or three days blow by in 3 minutes screen time. Despite all this while The Next Three Days is at ties slow, sometimes too damn slow, it is never really dull.Rusty as always is Mr Reliable and continues to be interesting even in boring films – I hope for his sake that the role called for him to put on a few kgs! Elizabeth Banks continues to broaden her CV by trying new things, even if her situation quite literally confines her and doesn't allow her to participate in much of the story aside from a few key scenes. Other bit parts are played by Olivia Wilde and Brian Dennehy – who thanks to his name and CV I fully expected to bust in unannounced with a plan of his own to save the day but it never came.The Next Three Days is hardly world-altering stuff. (It's also 25 minutes too long and I hated the way that they felt they need to spell out the ending, but that's way too spoiler-filled to discuss here.) The best recommendation I can give it is when it comes out on DVD it would be a decent enough film to watch with your parents around. Sure it's a niche market but I can't find another situation that lends itself to hunting this down.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. A decent 'adult drama' that is consistent (no big highs, no real lows) but not a lot more than that.",The Next Three Days
65,antoniotierno,solid performances and excellent camera-work,7,8 April 2011,"This is a very tense prison-break movie with Russel Crowe delivering a stunning performance. The lead actor brightens up and carries the story with one of his most convincing performances. Acting aside, everything's in place, well told and crafted with Crowe (I say it again) carrying out a masterly work. The plot is certainly unlikely and implausible but the story never seems to miss its target which is eventually to show action and to grip the viewer's attention. This movie has been a commercial failure in the United States, that is pretty strange considering the cast, the budget and the seemingly interesting plot (which proved very gripping as far as I can see).",The Next Three Days
66,napierslogs,Disregards reality in the name of love,6,13 March 2011,"""The Next Three Days"" disregards reality all in the name of love. John Brennan (Russell Crowe) really loves his wife and risks everything to be with her. Lara Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is in jail, but since that is the only interesting character trait about her, we luckily don't have to spend much time with her.John is plotting to get his wife out of jail. With the help of a surprisingly talkative escapee, unexplained helpful drug dealing scum, and his parents, he examines every detail of the big escape. In the best parts of the film, nothing was overly explained, each step was logical and despite the long running time of the film, it had a great flow.To watch ""The Next Three Days"" you have to be willing to leap further than most human beings can. But along the ride we do stop down for some great character work by Crowe. I accepted him whole-heartedly in what is possibly the best role for him. It has one better actor, one better character, and way more thought than most action thrillers, but it was still missing a great deal of believability and respect for the audience.It surprisingly has a lot of elements in common with the true story ""I Love You Phillip Morris"". As is usually the case, truth trumps fiction.",The Next Three Days
67,thekarmicnomad,Ommitting the superman makes for a VERY tense film,8,29 January 2012,"Me and my girlfriend were split on this film.We both agreed that it was very tense and keeps you guessing right up until the credits roll. Which is not only fantastic but very rare now-days.The thing I love the most about this film is the human element. In most films if you need something from the underworld someone knows someone and the goods just show up. In actuality it must be very hard, and what is the protocol? 'Here is my money Mr Gangster now can I have the bits I need? Pretty please?' I think the main character is very normal, to the point of blandness. Which again I think is great; the majority of us aren't charming or suave but kind of, well bland. Where the 'Joe Normal' lead made me care more about the character it made my girlfriend care less.The film takes a while to get going and you have to saviour the moments of action when they came along.This film is quite long and it does feel it (in a good way) so if you have a fair amount of patience and you don't require your leading men to be superhuman this is definitely worth a watch.",The Next Three Days

I'm sure that if I sat down and tried to carefully analyze the plot for holes, I'd find a bunch; however, the film is so well done that it's effortless to suspend disbelief. All of the actors are really strong, but there's going to be way too little blood and gore, not to mention almost no body count, to hold a lot of people's attention nowadays. Definitely more a thinking-persons film than the ""let's kill them all and let God sort them out"" kind. So ask yourself before you embark on this 2 hour journey if that's really what you're after. It's what I wanted, and this film delivered the goods nearly flawlessly.",The Next Three Days
69,gregsrants,Great thriller in line with The Town,8,7 November 2010,"In Paul Haggis' new thriller, The Next Three Days, Laura Brennan (Elizabeth Banks) is accused of killing her boss and is sent to prison. Her husband, John Brennan (Russell Crowe) battles through the legal system for nearly three years before seemingly running out of options. Choosing not to go the Hilary Swank route a la Conviction and spend the next 30 years trying to learn and eventually beat the system, John elects instead to speak to an expert on prison escapes (a wonderfully placed cameo by Liam Neeson) to get pointers on what to expect in a daring prison break attempt. The Neeson character gives important advice in reference to the time it takes for authorities to seal off a city's exits, but also gives insight into what his plan should include – ""You have to have the entire plan already in place. And you have to ask yourself, can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas stationcause to do this thing, that's what you have to become."" Audiences are then treated to a taut and thrilling attempt by John to free his wife out of prison and reunite the family which includes their young son Luke (Ty Simpkins).The Next Three Days is a better than average thrill ride filled with equal moments of edge-of-your-seat action and true emotion that spurs the entire cast. Crowe quickly makes us forget that Robin Hood stole our box office money earlier this year and turns in a top-rate performance as the husband who must become a criminal himself in an attempt to pull off the impossible. The supporting cast which includes a non-glamorous Banks and small but memorable turns by Daniel Stern and Brian Dennehy help bridge the quieter moments of the 2+ hour film.As John maps out his intricate plan, he is met with obstacles that force him to revise his original course of action to supplement for the unforeseen complications. His attempts at securing financing and proper papers (Drivers License, Passport) take the majority of the film's running time and helps provide insight into the transformation of John's character that goes from college professor to cold blooded killer.When John does launch his intentions, The Next Three Days soars as an exciting chase throughout the Pittsburgh streets and sidewalks as a group lead by Lt. Nabulsi (Lennie James) gives relentless chase to the fleeing Brennans.Paul Haggis (who also penned the screenplay) directs for the first time since the underrated In The Valley of Elah in 2007 and crafts an exhilarating cat and mouse game that involves audiences in a root-for-the-family emotional ride all the while suggesting that protagonist John is equally guilty in his relentless pursuit. Surprisingly not complicating our support is the idea that Laura may indeed be guilty of the crime to which she was convicted.The ever twisting screenplay shows Haggis' knack for writing scripts that don't allow audiences to get too far ahead of the story developments as unexpected and plausible scenarios affect even the best laid out of plans. This may leave lesser minded cinephiles wondering why certain scenes were not left on the cutting room floor (a DVD chapters worth of making a specific key, for example), but for those engrossed in the ongoing struggle of John's pursuit should appreciate the occasional red herring.The sum of the above leaves The Next Three Days as on par or better than Ben Affleck's well-received The Town earlier this fall. It's a throwback to the superior thrillers of the late 1970's where the story journey's down unexpected highways while enthralling an audience along the way.",The Next Three Days
70,Danusha_Goska,Efficient Thriller,8,21 November 2010,"""The Next Three Days"" is a tight, hard-hitting thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. I really didn't know, right up to the final moments, how it would end – and because the film had expertly guided me to care about all the characters, even some random losers in a meth lab, I did care about how it would end. The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so, and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film's desperate tone. Elizabeth Banks' too-good-to-be-true wholesome, sunny good looks are well used. ""The Next Three Days"" reminded me of Hitchcock, and of 1993's ""The Fugitive,"" but it doesn't rise to that level of classic. Rather, it's a well-oiled machine, designed efficiently to crank out the audience's engagement, tension and release.There are a couple of especially good moments. The opening scene could have been satisfactory if all it did was to set the stage for what is to follow, but it does so much more. I'd love to watch that scene again (and again). A women with a plunging neckline spars with Lara, a more modestly dressed woman, about whether or not women can ever get over their competition over men and bond with each other. The scene demonstrates its contents: Ms. Décolletage uses double entendres to make a pass at Lara's husband, and Lara shows the audience she is quite capable of losing her temper, an important plot point. The brilliant writing in this scene is a bonus. There is a scene involving a sewer drain that economically resolves a question the audience has had for some time. A scene with a car door is similarly powerful and informative. Brian Dennehy's performance as an intimacy-impaired, working class dad is almost wordless and quite brilliant. And the film really does bring poignancy to the scum of the earth, drug dealers.",The Next Three Days
71,jrarichards,"""Prepare for the jailbreak"" movie ennobled by purity of love",9,10 June 2018,"Movies that devote much of their time to detailed preparations for major crimes have always got up my nose, big-time, but ""The Next Three Days"" from Canadian Paul Haggis (who directed and screenwrote) is in a somewhat different class, thanks to its deployment of Russell Crowe in full single-minded obsessive mode (a la ""Noah"" or ""Water Diviner"" both in fact released 4 years after this movie). Here he's good-guy teacher John Brennan, whose commitment to his wife Laura is so great and unswerving that - as the book this film was based on puts it, he'll do ""Anything for Her"". And a bright guy who's also utterly determined can indeed get up to pretty much anything. But for that to work, we have to have a romance-cum-symbiosis between the husband and wife, and here a sublimely attractive, but even-more-gorgeous-below-the-surface Elizabeth Banks carries that off just beautifully. Somehow we viewers can just feel the sparks of chemistry that fly between the pair when they meet up, most especially at visiting times in the Allegheny Jail.This by the way makes it all the more devastating when John's meticulous (and largely unlawful) plans to break his wife out might conceivably be derailed, not by any external factors or technical difficulties, but by a moment of despair and anger from his other half that makes her try to persuade him she's actually guilty of the crime she's been locked up for. This is a good twist, as it externalises her feeling of guilt over how her incarceration has ruined their family life, but also her recognition that his devotion and loyalty to her probably exceeds hers for him, or indeed pretty much anything anyone can think of! She is tired of being married to a Saint, and wants to put him off. But of course he's in so deep, and the plan now means so much to him, that it matters not. He can't, won't believe she's guilty, and that's that.The idea that the police might somehow cotton on to what Brennan is planning is a touch far-fetched, but this opens up the film greatly (at just the right point) and also gives us the chance to see Lennie James in action as the Lieutenant - always a pleasure. Several other police staff do their portrayals well enough here likewise. Of course, teacher Brennan has to learn how jailbreaks can be achieved from someone, and who better than Liam Neeson in a cameo as an author whose claim to fame is describing how he himself got out (only to give himself up again at the end)? The shortlist of tips this guy offers in a few minutes forms the basis for a large chunk of John Brennan's life, and the meticulousness with which the scheme is set up is matched by the meticulous arranging of the film. The lovely Olivia Wilde is also in there, ostensibly to ensure that the Brennans' kid is at a party at Pittsburgh Zoo at the vital moment, leaving the dilemma of being together as couple or a full family writ large; but actually also serving to make it clear to us all that nothing/nobody can tempt John away from Laura.The great Brian Dennehy also has his part to play as John's father George, but boy do we have to wait for him to make his move! For what seems like an age he's saying and doing pretty much nothing; but then there's a vital, beautiful, if short couple of scenes in there at the end which allow yet another actor's integrity to shine through in this movie. If John has some fundamental understanding of his wife, so - at this moment - does tough-guy father George feel and understand and appreciate and praise exactly what his son is getting up to. And all achieved with hardly a word said!Few but Dennehy could have got that right, and it's a pleasure to watch him do so. In short, very little is left to chance in this film, and that really pays its dividends in delivering us a taut and meaningful crime thriller, but also a supremely romantic piece of storytelling. We envy (if slightly also fear) Brennan's feelings for his Laura, which go beyond love into some visceral need or addiction - he simply cannot exist as a whole human being while she is imprisoned. Indeed, this is even reflected cleverly in the filming, with colour only really making itself felt at the beginning, and again in the final half hour or so. In between, all is dark and dull and desperate, if of course supremely focused on Brennan's task in hand, which he pursues without fear, in the face of all possible odds.This is a fine piece of work that hasn't aged a bit in 8 years, and will pay both watching and rewatching.",The Next Three Days

This one is an almost carbon copy and it sucks . It's not strange , since it was written and directed by Paul Haggis – famous for the dreadful ""Crash"".This movie is perfect example how NOT to make a thriller . The movie is full of stars that are wasted . OK , Russell Crowe (""Gladiator"") is nice as the main hero and he definitely tries hard. Liam Nesson (""Schindler's list"") appears for less than 5 minutes in a role that could have been played by anyone . Same goes for Olivia Wilde (""House MD"") who gives a bland performance , but can you really blame her since she is stuck in bland role of ""the girl next door"" ? Daniel Stern (""Home alone"") is nice as the advocate , but has about 5 minutes of screen time . It's also sad to see veteran actor Brian Dennehy (""Rambo : First blood"") in a role of father of main hero . He has like 4 lines in the whole movie ! Pretty much screen time is given to Elizabeth Banks who plays the wife and is rather awful.All the characters are sketchily written and uninteresting . Only Crowe and Dennehy give their characters an illusion of depth . Haggis also shows us some terribly clichéd FBI agents who are always one step behind our hero. It's not surprising that the smartest FBI agent is black – political correctness is s**t.The movie is 2 hours long . 2 ANNOYING hours long . Nothing really happens during that time . The movie is routine , step by step generic thriller that isn't one bit surprising or exciting. We have to sit and watch uninteresting characters talk uninteresting dialogue . Even the action scenes suck . There is also some stupidity here . The transformation of Crowe's character from teacher to action hero is laughable and completely unbelievable. His plan and the way he tricks the authorities is hardly believable.The fact that this dull imitation of good thriller has good rating (7.3) makes me think that modern generation of viewers never have seen any good thriller in their life.

75,davyd-02237,Intense!,7,7 December 2019,"Not suitable for children given the content. Russell Crowe isn't (if my recall is accurate) ever off screen and this is built around him. It is never about did she/didn't she as he is a husband who simply believes she could not have killed her boss despite the evidence so he plans a method of getting her out of jail. The only odd part, for me is, during the film a drug dealer gets killed, the police are very keen to find out who killed this low life and go to amazing lengths to find the culprit, for me I find that odd. This is well worked, its edge of the seat and toward the end you do find out about the murder. Brian Dennehy, who for me is one of the finest actors given his presence when on screen doesn't say much but hes one of those fathers who ""just knows"" and its great to see him carry out his part in the manner he does.

Oh yes, self-infatuated writer-director auteurs revel in describing their inner soul, their own shortcomings etc.More often than not this results in a pathetically indecisive and introverted schmuck of a character. Here this is the 'substance' of a fat hour of exposition. Then the movie gets moving at last, but we're already irritated by this lame character.To make things worse everything is stretched beyond acceptance. Suspension of disbelief: seriously you can stretch this when you beat some rhythm, certainly not when you overindulge in a character study that slows to a crawl. What is the real focus, the big motivator, the McGuffin or whatever? Certainly too mundane for challenging question. With all the footage gobbled, most of the time we hardly know what really goes on in the hero's mind.Frankly it's much more satisfying to have a hero who knows pretty soon what he is doing than being asked to believe in the self-aggrandisement towards action of a literary scholar.Nice views of Pittsburg though.",The Next Three Days
77,JohnRayPeterson,"If not at the edge of your seat flick, it's at least a no reclining expected here movie.",8,24 March 2011,"If not at the edge of your seat flick, it's at least a no reclining expected here movie. Every good movie must have a good story to start with. This one most assuredly has a winning story. It's an adaptation of Fred Cavayé's 'Anything for Her – Pour Elle '/2008, written by Paul Haggis no less. This is not just a cliché compliment but one for which Haggis is very deserving; Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace sequel, The Black Donnellys, Million Dollar Baby, Crash(2004), In the Valley of Elah, Letters from Iwo Jima to mention ones you would relate to, are Haggis' work. Ah, got your attention now huh! Haggis has more directorial experience than Fred Cavayé who wrote and directed the original 'Pour Elle'; that experience, I think, distinguishes the resulting production. There is little difference between the two versions story lines; the French movie has that French movie flair and the U.S. version is slicker. There are numerous nuances which distinguish the two versions; that is the best way I can describe it. Haggis' version has a few more scenes, all, in my view, helpful to the flow and clarity of the developing story on screen and the understanding of the characters' demeanors. Those additional scenes are: How and when the main character finds the key to his plan - The main character writing and reading his escape phases' deadlines on his forearm emphasizing the crucial importance of those deadlines- Where the main character hides his son for the dangerous and volatile portion of the escape, before he retrieves him – The second suicide attempt of the main character's wife during the escape.Not only was the story more compelling to watch unfold (in both cases) than the storyline would have you expect, it was well directed, also by Paul Haggis. You think you know almost for certain what the lead actor is going to do next but the details, that you could not predict, keep you glued to the screen (until you pause the blue ray player to go get stocked up on the snacks, as the case may be). Knowing or predicting what you think is going to happen next however negative a factor this usually is, in this movie, it is not. Not an easy argument to make? I have the advantage of having seen it and know why it is a factor that will keep you watching. As you try to anticipate the next move by the lead actor, and you find yourself doing that a lot, you crave to know what the consequences are going to be if you are right, because that much you could not predict unless you are Boris Spasky, and when you don't get you predictions right, again you want to stick around to find out what's going to happen next. Haggis has the ability to keep you interested in every detail. Knowing how Russell Crowe works with directors, there's little that was likely overlooked. Crowe is collaborative with directors as well as with other actors. I said collaborative, not cooperative; the distinction is one I learned listening to Ridley Scott. I will not likely change anybody's mind about Crowe, like him or not like him, but he does a good enough job for you to set aside your opinion of him if it is not a flattering one. I did not have that problem, I happen to be a fan. The movie does not let you doubt whatever scene you are watching. The pieces are put together in such a way that you are left convinced you have not missed any important detail; it flows as it needs to, not inserting a needless action or line when you don't want one, and providing you with moves and words you need to see and hear to believe where you are heading. Elizabeth Banks, Ty Simpkins, Helen Carey and Brian Dennehy are very convincing Brennan family members; I much enjoyed their performances. When John Brennan, Russell Crowe's character, has the meeting with Damon Pennington, Liam Neeson's character, you get hooked right then and there; it is the only scene featuring Neeson, but it is like the starting pistol in a one hundred yard dash. The movie could not do without that scene and it could not have been more of an attention (interest) grabber; no special effects, but you can almost feel your pupil dilate. Cavayé's version has that scene but it does not have the same reach as Neeson's delivery. You should expect the movie's ending but you probably won't because all the twists and turns getting you to that moment have to have drained your thinking process to the point where you are resigned to the idea that the writer's scenario is far better than the one you have kept coming up with. The U.S. movie is a glaring rip-off of the French one, as are so many other successful Hollywood movies. I preferred Haggis's version, in this case, because it was easier to watch. I'm glad I saw Vincent Lindon and Diane Kruger performances in the original version. If you are not a Russell Crow fan then you're in luck, you can watch 'Anything for Her'; I recommend you do.",The Next Three Days

At first she looked a little suspension to me. Big mouth, Blood on her Jacket, Gets upset pretty easy, She had it out with this Women, Plus the one out for Dinner. Plus gets upset with Husband alot.
Then when the Husband was working so Hard it kind of changed my mind why. He knows his Wife she has a Temper but she is not a KILLER.
But the whole taking her out of Prison was the BEST it just Showed how STUPID THE LAW REALLY IS.
Loved when he crossed the bourder with simply. Just driving that Older Couple over the bourder why. Because they were looking for a Mom and Dad and Small Child. What LAW YOU DIDN'T HAVE PHOTOS AT THE BOURDER???

82,christophe92300,Surprisingly very good,8,29 January 2013,"The first part of the movie is rather slow but very interesting and allows the tension to build little by little. Then comes the second part, a big rush of adrenaline that captivates the viewer until the final outcome.The script is surgical and the staging very subtle, relying on looks and silences instead of long dialogues. Paul Haggis masterly handled the rhythm of the movie, not showing any longueur or drop of dynamism despite two very different parts that come together marvelously though.As for Russell Crowe, he carries the movie on his shoulders, and his sober and subtle acting matches rather well the style Haggis wanted to put into this remake, even if it can also annoy some.In the end, the only thing that can be blamed in this feature is it taking the easy way out at times, primarily in the second part where some twists and turns are a bit far-fetched.",The Next Three Days
83,davidgee,Gritty and noir-ish,7,15 January 2011,"Another noir French thriller is converted into a 'noir-ish' American thriller. Russell Crowe's slightly thuggish looks make him more convincing as the desperado of the second half than the mild-mannered schoolteacher of the first half. Elizabeth Banks's role as the imprisoned wife is slightly under-written; their cute toddler son steals most of her scenes and even some of Russell's.The plot takes too long to set up, so the first half of the film is a slow haul. But the last half has almost the cracking pace of a DIE HARD romp. Writer/director Paul Haggis elects to deceive the audience as well as the police who are in close pursuit of the fugitives, which puts this in the tradition of 'classics' like TO CATCH A THIEF and CHARADE. Gritty and enjoyable.",The Next Three Days
84,danielmanson,Much better than I expected,8,18 November 2020,"I have to say, I was massively surprised by this film (in a good way).The plot is completely different to what you expect. Within the first 5 mins the wife is arrested for murder. So you're expecting a crime thriller, however, this isn't the case as it changes up to a prison escape plot. I personally liked this, because I really didn't expect it at all. Beyond that, the acting is really good, the overall plot holds up and isn't confusing and the ending is really well done in terms of suspense. I was genuinely sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened.I had one or two minor issues with this film, nothing that takes anything away, but just a couple of things which bugged me.
when you realise it's a prison escape film, there's no thriller aspect. It's more of a good action film. (Nothing wrong with this, but if you're expecting an in-depth thriller, don't.)the kid was really annoying. There was something about him which just annoyed me throughout the entire film. Luckily he didn't seem to have a lot of lines, but he just grinded my gears somewhat.That's me nit picking really, overall it's a really good film and well worth watching.",The Next Three Days

For me this is not that much of a thriller, maybe it's because I'm not totally clear on the genre Thriller, yes this was exciting at times, but not really thrilling, not scary and didn't keep me on the edge of my seat. For me this was more a drama, with some action and some excitement, and that's not a bad thing at all, it worked, I liked the movie a lot. Russell Crowe is a great actor and that he proves once again, but also the acting of all the others in the cast did a great job, there are a few Hollywood things here and there, very clever cops that almost have a hunch for knowing things they possible could not, and a few other things, but that does not fall on the actors at all.",The Next Three Days
88,socrates99,"Very underrated, very well written, acted and directed thriller",9,17 March 2011,"This is both my favorite movie of 2010 and the most harrowing 2 hours I've gone through in a very long time. It's not that it's full of extreme action scenes, but that it is so realistic that you feel the dread at every turn. The contrast to something like Liam Neeson's last film, Unknown, is like night and day though I should mention that Neeson has only a cameo here. And I was more than glad I was watching this on DVD and not in the theaters because I needed to stop and take a breather every once and a while.The story's a simple one. Man's beloved wife and mother to his son is found guilty of murder. He doesn't believe she did it and attempts to get her out of jail. Are there improbable events along the way? Yes, but I barely noticed them because I was enjoying the movie too much to stop and criticize. How can you criticize a film that may have made a few leaps into the improbable when for the bulk of the film, everything could very well have happened as depicted? Crowe and Banks deliver while supported by a cast that clearly believed in this movie. This is the first time I've understood the hype about Haggis though I loved Casino Royale.",The Next Three Days
89,MCMAYNERBERRY,Why didn't he just find the real killer?,6,6 June 2014,"*Spoilers*Trust me, it's an entertaining two hours, but the main issue here is pretty much the main protagonist taking the illegal and hardest possible way to get back with his wife. It's established Banks didn't do it at the end, and during the middle of the film I asked myself out loud: ""Why didn't he just find the real killer?""Russell Crowe delivers what he can, but as the film goes on, you can't help but feel bad as you know this guy is doing a bad thing, especially when towards the end you wonder why he's sticking his neck out for her. Out of nowhere she's snaky with him and makes the escape more difficult.So many supporting characters enter and exit unceremoniously. Olivia Wilde's storyline never goes anywhere, she just turns up for a convenient person to put Crowe's son on while he plans. Liam Neeson is featured predominantly, yet his screen time barely scratches 5 minutes. Lennie James appears out of nowhere as the main cop pursuing when the two cops who originally arrested his wife were the most suspicious.The script seems like something much grander, but entered extensive rewrites. This could explain Olivia Wilde and Liam Neeson. They could've probably been cohorts in the escape. Or in Wilde's case, an alternate love interest for Crowe as he realizes the risk is not worth it and his wife tells him to move on. Hell, there was a scene during the admittedly well executed escape where he doesn't go pick up his son from the zoo where Wilde's daughter's birthday was held, making it seem the kid would be in her care. But in the end it didn't happen, and Wilde and Neeson just seem unnecessary.The Next Three Days is OK, with some good performances and a well done climax. But it's bogged down with a glaring plot hole, and plot points that go nowhere.The Next Three Days 6/10",The Next Three Days
90,dvc5159,Great acting and well-crafted romantic thriller,6,26 November 2010,"The film opens strongly with a blood-splattered college professor John Brennan (Russell Crowe) driving away from something, with a passenger beside him barely clinging on to life and gasping for air. Flash back three years before and we see him and his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) as a happily married couple, complete with a nice house, a kid, and respectable careers. All this changes when Lara is suddenly arrested at home for charges of murder. Another flash forward three years later - John is a single parent to his traumatized son Luke; Lara is in prison with her last appeal being denied and her son looking away from her; and the crime is left unsolved. Both John and Lara are driven to the edge of their human nature, with John becoming more and more desperate to get his wife out of prison at ANY cost, and Lara becoming more and more pessimistic about her situation, to the point of attempting suicide. That, for John, was the final straw.A remake of a French film, ""Anything For Her"", which I sadly had the misfortune of not seeing prior to this; ""The Next Three Days"" is ultimately a well-crafted thriller with a plateful of good performances, heart-pounding suspense, and ultimately, intense passion and romance. Yes, this is ultimately a love story as it poses the all-too-obvious question - how far will one go to save the one they love?Clichéd as that may sound (and arguably it is), it is made believable with Crowe's moody and grim performance, and a rare and surprisingly great dramatic turn for Banks, who shows that she has acting chops after supporting and starring roles in many a romantic comedy. Crowe shows calm moments when with his wife, but we all know that underneath is an angry and desperate man waiting to explode, and we can see that in his eyes. Banks gives a frank and focused performance, with the kind of sorrow one feels like when seeing a puppy getting kicked for no reason. But ultimately this is Crowe's show, and he pulls off his role with confidence.The crime being unsolved is not the matter in this film. It's all about John and his quest to get Lara out. And John being a normal college professor, consults a prison escapee (Liam Neeson in an all-too-short supporting performance) on how to break out of any prison, and the plan is set. The law is depicted as being realistically tough and cruel. But the audience is placed firmly on John's side the moment the film starts, it becomes no surprise that the audience cheers when John manages to elude every law enforcement agency that comes after him.Writer/director Paul Haggis, who wrote and directed the Oscar-winning Best Picture ""Crash"", tries something mainstream and he slightly succeeds. Don't get me wrong - Haggis is a great screenwriter and great dramatic film director, but here he is working with fast-paced material here. The slow moments tend to drag on for quite some time and this distracts the audience's attention. The screenplay also has some trouble - especially near the end; Olivia Wilde's character doesn't have much purpose (although her acting is okay), and especially John evades the law so efficiently and perfectly to the point where I felt I nearly had to suspend my disbelief. None-the-less, the plot twists and the thrills just kept on coming in the second leg of the film, and it grabs your attention. This is where Haggis succeeds brilliantly with his direction.The production design really makes great use of Pittsburgh, the cinematography is nicely framed without shaky cam, but I felt that the music by veteran Danny Elfman is a bit too heavy-handed and melodramatic. On the supporting actors, besides Banks, Wilde and Neeson, we get good support from Brian Dennehy, Jason Beghe, RZA, Jonathan Tucker, Kevin Corrigan, Tyrone Giordano and Daniel Stern.Is this going to win any Oscars? Probably not, but I sense a new chapter for Elizabeth Banks' career. And slow as this may be, this is actually a terrific date movie you can bring your other to if the both of you have the patience. The pacing may be a bit muddled and this definitely is not up to par with other superior mainstream thrillers such as ""The Fugitive"" or anything by Hitchcock, but ultimately Haggis has crafted a very handsome and slick thriller.Now excuse me while I hunt down the original. Why can't my country (Malaysia) show more foreign films?!Overall rating: 73/100",The Next Three Days
91,doug_park2001,"Good Thriller with Both Clever and ""Meh!"" Qualities",7,9 May 2013,"I was hoping for more in the way of legal drama here, but there is almost nothing on how/why wife Lara is convicted of murder. Most of the earlier portions focus on husband John plotting ways to get her out via alternate methods. This gets interesting in places, and if you enjoy chase scenes, there are plenty of those in this film. THE NEXT THREE DAYS has its share of surprises and uses subtle details very well; however, it also has its share of missing pieces and near-misses (cars speeding through red lights and congested traffic, just barely managing to avoid numerous collisions, etc).THE NEXT THREE DAYS is a remake of the French film, POUR ELLE, and the fact that it's a remake might explain its more uneven qualities. TNTD would be oh-so-much better if we were allowed to know Lara and her motivations just a little bit better--a few quick flashbacks to her relationship with her murdered boss, her family, and the trial would have helped tremendously. I kept thinking, ""This is a generally good thriller film, but it might work better in short novel format."" I almost never listen to directors' commentaries, but made an exception here: The way the directors explained the ending was very helpful and illuminating.",The Next Three Days
92,Meven_Stoffat,Oh no she di-int!!!!,4,3 May 2011,"I didn't know this was a remake of a French movie until I slapped the money down on the counter and the clerk asked me if I'd had seen the French version. That's when an alarm went off in my head and my inner curmudgeon asked ""Where is the originality these days???"" And after watching this over-long and convoluted bore, I can't imagine the French movie being any better.On a positive note, this movie has a good cast- Russell Crowe, Elisabeth Banks, Liam Neeson and a few others. However, all but Neeson are horribly wooden in this film. It's unfortunate that Neeson only makes a cameo because his 5 minute performance had more emotion in it than anyone in the 130 minute duration of the movie. Russell Crowe goes about sounding like he is reading his lines off a sheet of paper, and Banks keeps the same monotone voice through the ENTIRE movie.I still am unsure of the movie's plot after seeing this disaster. Basically Crowe's wife is accused of murder, and the police arrest her as soon as she discovers the splattered blood on her jacket (seriously she didn't notice until just days after it happened?!?!?!?!). After battling the justice system for 3 years with no luck, she is sentenced to serve a life prison sentence in three days. Crowe, unable to find anything else to do, decides to bust her out of jail... and then the rest of the movie doesn't make much more sense.Well, I'm all for a wrongfully accused movie- one that makes you think, one that has the viewer on the edge of their seat, but this movie is so implausible I can't even begin to describe. My biggest problem being the movie's ending- it turns out she didn't do the crime, someone just bumped into her with blood on her, but we get what sounds like a clear confession in the middle during this exchange:Banks: ""You never even asked me if I did it!"" Crowe: ""Because I knew you were innocent!"" Banks: ""Well then you would have been wrong!"" This somehow left me feeling at the end ""What...?"". Maybe it's that I'm getting older- I'm not a teenager anymore so therefore it's becoming easier to pick a movie apart- I understand what suspension of disbelief is, and I know what implausibility is- the latter is what his movie flirts with. And plain and simple, if a movie is not believable in the least bit, I can't get into it. Let's also not forget them trying to get into Canada. A Canuck myself, Canadian officials are NOT as stupid as shown in the movie!!! Having been in almost every main airport, security would be able to detect a photoshopping job in a (fake) passport. Toronto and Montreal are especially hard on these.I wish I could recommend this movie but it is all too implausible and confusing. I haven't seen the French movie but I already don't plan to. Ah well, at least this wasn't 3D.",The Next Three Days

94,FallenEye,The Curious Case of Lara's Button.,8,10 October 2018,"The mixture of planning and improvisation, along with preparation against impromptu circumstances, put together with the thought process depiction of the plan by creating practical obstacles and solutions that may be feasible considering the human mind when desperate, really goes a long way in making this film a near epic ride. From there, the thrill that it gives, only further solidifies The Next Three Days' entertainment factor and integrity. The greatest critique against this movie is perhaps how implausible it may be. However to that, I say every single film or series about prison escapes is at varying degrees of implausible, of course that doesn't give any film the right to be outlandish. The next three days were not outlandish, they just required a little bit of luck, in the words of Damon Pennington.Yes, robbing a meth lab from a couple of gangsters is a bit out there, but consider his situation, and how pressing it is, and the good job Paul Haggis did in setting that up, and it's pretty simple to see how plausible it can be.The dynamic and chemistry between Crowe and Banks is bankable, and their performances are decidedly credible. The tension throughout the movie is bubbling, and during the climax, it's pretty explosive. The screenplay's simplicity with spice makes this film a hearty dish worth a signature status, and the ending is awesome, in how it mixes vindication with sorrow.What I'm failing to see however is, what does the button prove? What is it about that button, that they can't do without? How does it prove her innocence? How does it lead them to the homeless girl?But, even with that conundrum, The Next Three Days is a ballsy and gutsy 8/10.",The Next Three Days
95,Jerique,Russel Crowe's best?,8,3 April 2011,"Elizabeth Banks and Russel Crowe lead the cast in this film where a man will stop at nothing to get his wife back. It's an inspirational film, even with the obvious tragedies that occur in it.Russel Crowe plays John Brennan, whose wife is accused of murdering her boss. After three years spent in prison, John devises a plan with the help of Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson) to break her out and have his son's mother back.It's not an incredibly action packed movie, but it's does do its fair share of thrilling with just cleverness, edged drama and psychological aspects. In the final thirty minutes, it's where all the action hides. It doesn't have beautiful cinematography, but it's decent enough. The characters are realistic and the story is believable enough to allow for the audience to remain on their heels throughout the ordeal.It's a drama, most of all, to me. I felt that a majority of the film relies on Russel's dialogue or thoughts which are obvious to the viewer. He plans and plans for half the movie on how to break her out and we see a couple failed attempts and close calls along the way.Overall, this is a good movie and I really thought it was a good remake (even though I've not seen the original) and I hope more people give it a chance. I think the only thing that I didn't like very much was the fact that the previews allow you to assume that Elizabeth Banks' character is at risk of being hit by a truck by hanging out of the passenger side of the car. Well, it's a but of misdirection because she is never actually at risk. It's a good way to get the audience to watch the movie with that kind of extreme shot.

To say you have to suspend disbelief watching The Next Three Days is no misunderstatement, mainly because you really can't see or understand what's going on for most of the film, even though nothing much happens for the first 90 minutes.Pittsburgh, Pa. cops bust into the middle class suburban Crow home, Gestapo fashion, to arrest his wife for murder.Years later she's still in jail and you wonder where the time went, yet the film is still in its early stages...it lasts more than two hours in total.After exhausting all legal appeals Crow decides to bust his wife out of jail....and there I became lost because he seemed lost, which obviously was the director;s intent, to show a desperate man searching for a solution. But this didn't transfer to the screen well. Insteas Crow seemed to be sleepwalking the tedious planning stages, mostly in the sort of noir darkness we see in some super hero films such as the Dark Knight.Yet, we never really see the plan because it becomes sort of an ad hock escape attempt.But, for me the real corker was when the cops get involved...total trite worn-out contrivance from start to finish.What took you two hours to witness, the cops solve in a few minutes. In the end you are left with asking why you wasted so much time, and money if you took a date to see the Next Three Days.Another major flaw with the film, as I mentioned, was its length...a max of 90 minutes would have been better for a film with so little actual substance.",The Next Three Days

Haggis has a unique methodology to his films and a unique way to truly draw the audience in.
The film is genuinely slow to start as we get introduced to all the characters and why we come to where we are in the film. Lara Brennan, wonderfully and masterfully played by (Elizabeth Banks) is wrongly convicted of murdering her boss and is sentenced to life in prison. we pick up with her young son Luke, who ceases to acknowledge her during prison visits.

Lara attempts suicide and her husband, John (Russell Crowe), becomes obsessed with breaking her out of prison.This is truly where the methodology of the plot and film pick up. The heart and soul of John's life and he will stop at nothing to be a family again and free her. Paul Haggis works creative depths with his writing and style of directing.

Director Paul Haggis who has brought us such greats such as Million Dollar Baby (writer) Casino Royale (screenplay) and last but not least In The Valley Of Elah (director,writer) brings us a tale of one man's roller coaster of a ride to keep his family intact.

103,blacklist-1,An excellent drama thriller with two terrific leading performances from Crowe and Banks.,9,5 January 2011,"Russell Crowe is far removed from being the historical action hero, in Gladiator and the recent Robin Hood and plays in The Next Three Days family man John Brennan whose wife Laura (Elizabeth Banks) is arrested and convicted for, murdering her boss who she always argued with. Over the next three years John gets on with his life with looking after his son and teaching his class, as he is a college professor but tries to get his wife out via an appeal as he believes she is innocent.Eventually though he gets nowhere and is pushed to the edge where he decides he is going to break his wife out of prison to start a new life with her and his son elsewhere. Most of the two hour + five minute time is taking up John planning step by step how to get his wife out of prison and their escape. The story is very well thought out and is possible and believable with how John goes about it. Crowe gives an excellent performance of a man who is a law-abiding citizen but driven out of desperation for love of his wife decides to break the law to achieve having his family back again. Elizabeth Banks impresses again with a very believable performance, proving that she is a great actress, just for me, not at romantic comedies. John gets help of planning the break out from Damon Pennington (a small cameo appearance greatly acted by Liam Neeson).Also John becomes friends with a neighbour Nicole (played in a small part sensitively and well by Olivia Wilde), whilst planning to break out his wife. Throughout we see the character of John facing moral dilemma's throughout of whether to hurt somebody or rob a bank to obtain money. We the audience face a similar dilemma of whether to root for the couple as director Paul Haggis cleverly keeps us from guessing if Laura did actually commit the murder. Even though she could have done it I ended up rooting for her and him anyway. He does it all out of love and you have to ask yourself. What would you do for someone you love? How far would you go? These are questions explored well as Crowe and Banks have a convincing chemistry of husband and wife that is maintained throughout and which never stops you believing in them. It's interesting to see how John carries out his plan of breaking her out, with a last half hour full of nail-biting suspense and tension at whether the family will escape as they have the police on their heels. This gripped me all the way through with a well made and acted drama thriller that I can certainly recommend to anyone. It's a great start of 2011 for films. Let's hope it continues!",The Next Three Days
104,asage19,Excellent thriller,8,21 July 2020,"Can't go wrong with Russell Crowe, fun to see Liam Neeson in that particular role. *Wonderful* to see Brian Dennehy. Elizabeth Banks was good - convincing in all facets of the character throughout her journey in the film. She actually probably had the most demanding role. So, yeah, great actors, great acting, great director. It's a nifty thriller, the payoff really is in the second half of the movie. It's a big too long, could use some tightening up in the first hour. OTOH, I was really very glad that no time at all was spent on court-room drama, no drawn-out explanations or protestations. Just boom! the cops arrive, she goes to jail, the action starts 3 years later. Good. Also, love that the ending, in Pittsburgh, was not a pretty ribbon tying up everything - life is just like that, it seems to say. It was never a police procedural. No melodrama at the start, no melodrama at the end. It's about their escape. Effective.",The Next Three Days
105,jkt2006,Loved it!!,7,24 October 2016,"Rarely does one come across a movie that is entertaining, engrossing and intelligent at the same time. This one keeps you engaged for a good 2 hours, well connected with the characters who are interesting, lively and above all, human. The director pulls the strings brilliantly without the viewer realizing about how and who until the climax. The central character played by Liam Neeson is brilliantly pulled off. Adrien Brody plays his part effortlessly as well, and Mila Kunis plays the role of a helpless mom with amazing conviction(have seen her in dumb Romantic Comedies only until now..) Overall, loved The Third Person, and am thankful to the creators for coming up with such well made a movie. Well spent 2 hours of my time!!",The Next Three Days
106,priyantha-bandara,Not the typical Jail break movie,6,19 March 2011,Russell Crowe is a promising actor. Coming from a great history like Gladiator and Master & Commander he is not a person to mess around with. But I have my doubts if his potential is completely used in 'The Next 3 Days'.The story goes like this. Russell portrays a community college teacher John Brennan. Having a perfect loving life with his wife and son it comes to a sudden halt when his wife Lara (played by Elizabeth Banks) is convicted for murder. With hard evidence to back the case she ends up in jail and John left helpless and heartbroken with his kid. Believing that his wife is not guilty he tries his level best to go through proper legal channels in order to get her free. After years trying every option and hitting a dead end he decides that it's time to play dirty. With that the calm dramatic movie suddenly starts to smell like Prison Break.'The Next 3 Days' is a long movie. It runs for good 15 mts more than two hours. But to my amusement it was not boring. There is lot of details involved and little little bits and pieces gathered from here and there which ultimately pulls of the master plot. Even though it's slow the plot manages to keep the attention centered well while providing intelligent twists time to time. So the story is quite unpredictable and its one reason why it's good. The other reason is that it concentrates on family and drama than being a jail break movie as a whole. Most of the scenes take place outside the prison walls and surrounding John so there is a vast number of opportunities and space to move about.However the script is not perfect. For me there are too many coincidences. You might call it luck but too much luck is not that good in a movie. After you watch the whole thing if a single one of those lucky moments were missing the movie should have ended quite early than expected. So depending on luck is not very promising when someone is working his brains out of a plan like this one.There is good performance from the leading actors but nothing worthwhile mentioning. Script doesn't offer space for good memorable quotes or maybe little weak at following timeliness.Overall 'The Next 3 Days' is a good view. But it will not go down in the history as one of best movies of Russell or Elizabeth nor will it be one of the best movies in your movie collection. You will not watch it twice but pretty much will enjoy it in one viewing.,The Next Three Days
107,Guanche48,Did she did it or not? ;),8,2 February 2021,"Great movie! worth watching, Russel Crowe is really good in this movie! Great action thriller and a well written story line.
Keeps you guessing the whole time and makes you think, what would you do?",The Next Three Days
108,OneAnjel,keeps you guessing & has a message,10,28 January 2021,"In the early part of the new century, the public became slowly aware of a small law firm in Los Angeles who were devoting their time to something eventually called The Innocence Project, a small group of attorneys who spent their personal resources on helping wrongly convicted prove their innocence (later becoming a non-profit). The idea that so many people were incarcerated unfairly was a mind-blowing realization to the lulled conscious of the average citizen. After watching Next Three Days, my sense was this film is based on that alarming reality, which only became more of a headliner through 2008 when this script was first debuted in a French film called Anything For Her. Collaborated on by a well-known producer/writer (Guillaume Lemans) and a writer/journalist (Fred Cavayé), work was almost immediately started on an English version starring Crowe. Here, we find an average family whose life is ripped out from under them from poor detective work, and the film even ends by highlighting the incompetency of the lead detectives when they fail to find the evidence that had waited 3 years for someone to bother searching for. I agree with some reviewers who say the Feds seemed a little too capable for the purposes of keeping just one heart-pounding step behind John. But wow, this film is a wild ride that keeps you anticipating each moment. It does start a bit slow but with necessary set-ups. Worth the watch. Crowe is great in this film, his low-key energy being a perfect poker-face for this unpredictable father and husband. The message? I think this film tells everyone that if the law ends up not being on our side despite our best efforts, we might just stop being the honest citizens we started out as. It's a message about patience and trust that realizes its futility.",The Next Three Days

Not the stupid asinine John Cohones TV show on ABC, but a very personal introspection of yourself and your resources, and determination, and willingness to persevere.Most people would have stopped when the Crowe character gets ripped off for $1,800 bucks for a fake passport.But to give up everything and leave the country?Think about it. I kept thinking it would be easier to try and find out who did the crime in the first place as Monk would do. But this film takes the most extreme position of jail break and escape.Loved seeing Brian Dennehy again, perhaps he should of played the cop Lt. Liam was great and I imagined him and Crowe switching roles. Both are top rate actors.When Crowe was in a dilemma, I thought, ""hey you're the Gladiator, kick his butt"", but alas that was another movie.Great movie: shots, character development, city scape shots, music, pacing , direction, writing.

112,quinnox-1,Russell Crowe shines in crime thriller,8,20 November 2010,"I think this is Crowe's best movie that I have seen him in since the great ""3:10 to Yuma"" western.He does a brilliant job as an average middle class successful man who slowly is driven to the edge because of his wife being in prison for a crime he thinks she did not commit. I think Crowe is one of the last few ""real"" movie stars around today and this movie just reinforces my opinion.The plan to get his wife out of prison is very clever, and he is meticulous in planning every small detail of his ingenious plan. But of course reality does not always go the way we expect, and its fascinating to watch how he deals with unforeseen obstacles that arise in his path.I thought this movie was really gripping and had a suspenseful story that you couldn't wait to see what would happen next, and Russell Crowe's amazing acting is the cement at the center of this fine movie. After a few disappointing movies in the recent past (Robin Hood is one example) Russell Crowe shows in this film he is one of the best and most interesting actors in movies today, and I am glad to see him get back to this point.",The Next Three Days
113,SivakumarBalachandran,How long will you go for your loved ones.....,8,27 March 2011,"This movie falls in the broad genre of Action-thriller but in a very particular sense it can be categorized as an Action plan- Execution type. And the movie lives up to the mark.The story is about an ordinary American husband who tries to prove that his wife is not guilty for which she has been arrested. Since he becomes saturated in meeting the law and order, he jumps into an action plan to kidnap his wife from the jail.Did he succeed his pursuit? Is the rest of the story given in full throttle action plan execution pack.Coming to the cast,Russell sweeps the best place once again for his natural way of acting - being an ordinary citizen of America. He has lived both as teacher also a extraordinary person towards his pursuit of happiness. Elizabeth banks has played a brilliant role of a wife/an innocent/a loving mother/also a law abiding citizen (i.e. when she refuses to co operate for her husband's plan which is against the law).Then should say about the cops they where so into the role and was a brilliant choice of casting.Director's (Paul Higgs) touch is so beautiful where he even shows the kid's expression towards his mother since he does not like her thinking that she is a murderer.On the whole we can enjoy the movie.It lives up to the title 'The Pursuit'.I would give 8 on 10",The Next Three Days
114,julieshotmail,Unsympathetic characters,6,14 May 2021,"The plot and twists in ""The Next Three Days"" are decent enough. The story keeps you guessing, wondering what happens next, and most of the time it's not the way you expect. All of that is good, however, the actual characters themselves are uninspiring. I like Elizabeth Banks most of all, but here, her character exhibits no qualities that make you truly want to root for her. The same goes with the dad and kid. It's a shame because the plot and action scenes are actually well-executed. I'm leaning towards not recommending this movie so you can spend those two hours doing something else that's more productive.",The Next Three Days
115,bjones,A Hold Your Breath Experience ...,8,22 November 2010,"At least you may want to while watching this fine thriller. This is an excellent entry into that genre by director Paul Haggis. The pacing and action are just right and the performances turned in by the whole cast is remarkably good.As one would expect from an actor with his credentials, Russell Crowe does a superb job with his part as John Brennan, the lost, forlorn and increasingly desperate husband of a woman he deeply believes is innocent of a crime she has been convicted of. Here Crowe is definitely living up to the expectations people have for him. His fans will not be disappointed.I found the performance of Elizabeth Banks more satisfying. I could feel her anguish and wanted to root for something to happen to help her. Stripped of makeup and other salon services for the majority of the film she reveals what a remarkably naturally beautiful woman she is. But her presence on screen definitely doesn't stop there. She brings just the right of emotion to a difficult role and helps us want to help her character. But there is more than just a stunning pathos there, she also allows us to see that there is a smoldering intelligence behind those baby-blues. There is an errant Oscar waiting somewhere with her name on it.Two old pros, Liam Neeson and Brian Dennehy, add solid support to the complex story. Dennehy even manages to deliver just the right note in a couple of scenes sans dialog. Neeson, especially, gives a fine turn as an ex-con giving realistic, hard-core advice to Crowe's character.Rounding out the ensemble are Lennie James as a bright and determined Police Lieutenant. Is it possible to root for him and the people he's chasing? His role is complimented by Aisha Hinds and Jason Beghe as tired but dedicated detectives. A mention should go to another fine if short performance by Daniel Stern as Banks' sincere but unsuccessful lawyer.On the flip side were Jonathan Tucker in a fine job as a hapless crook and Kevin Corrigan as a just as unlucky drug dealer. There is another small but good performance by Tyrone Giordano whom I remember from another good performance in ""The Family Stone"".Lastly, Olivia Wilde does a fine job with a small part as a woman who begins to show interest in the abandoned Crowe. I could go on-and-on as there are many other good performances, not a sour note in the lot.The rest of the film's elements fit the time and place so there is no incongruity. But the fine script and the resultant great acting is clearly what it's all about. If you're looking for a night of entertainment you can't go wrong here.By Bruce L.

116,joker-4,Clever thriller. Pass the popcorn.,9,14 May 2012,"As with most suspension-driven thrillers, there is always that built-in awareness, an unspoken agreement that most of the time occurs at the ticket kiosk or when pushing the ""Open/Close"" button on the Blu-ray player, that a dose of suspension-of-disbelief probably as hefty as the salt in the popcorn is as sure to occur as a montage sequence showing the story's protagonist preparing for that daredevil dive into the breathtaking unknown. THE NEXT THREE DAYS, writer/director Paul Haggis' thriller starring Russell Crowe and based from the 2008 French film POUR ELLE, is a convincing, fun, escape-plan thriller that still has its moments of disbelief-suspension, but consider such as the low-in-sodium variety.In a typical wrongly-accused fashion, with the other escape cliché being a revenge vendetta, Crowe's wife, Lara, played by Elizabeth Banks, is convicted of murder and soon to be sent to a high-level security prison. The courts cannot seem to help and so for his own sake, and that of his son's, Crowe's John Brennan opts to break her out and flee the country. There are, of course, rules for doing such and Liam Neeson provides those with a gruff-and-wizened voice of a Jedi teacher that the Internet has yet to master; the Internet does, however, provide John with all of the other techniques he needs in his arsenal, such as making a bump key as well as breaking into a van with a tennis ball. Paul Haggis' film gains intensity as the actual prison break occurs. Aside from the convenience that Lara is a diabetic and requires frequent blood work, which is what gives John his inside move, the audience is treated to the run of the escape as opposed to the planning – don't worry, the planning montage set to Danny Elfman's score is still there – allowing for more than a few heart-quickening moments where an out seems impossible. Alongside the ""how"" of the plan, Haggis addresses the ""why"", albeit in a typical Hollywood theme. The clarity in the hearts of her men that Lara's absence had since muddied since her incarceration three years ago; John is listless in his career and their son, Luke, doesn't interact with other kids. The answer is obviously that Love will find a way, and it does with the help of the Internet and a detailed, long- range plan. Haggis' film is clever, fun and highly-enjoyable, just pass that popcorn over if you don't mind.",The Next Three Days

121,politehere,Not exciting enough,6,4 November 2012,"The movie follows a pretty standard formula. The guy has set his heart on succeeding and as usual he does, and surprisingly without a scratch, so in this respect the movie doesn't have much to offer. The predictability takes away immensely from the excitement. I felt that I knew what was going to happen and that I had seen the same formula repeated many times before, so even where the movie was trying so hard to get the audience excited, I wasn't excited one bit. If you have seen ""Face Off"", ""The Arlington Road"", and ""Firewall"", it is unlikely that you will find this movie exciting, but it is a good way to pass the time. At least, I wasn't upset with wasting my time with a terrible movie, but I expected something original and exciting, which sadly this movie failed to deliver. Also, at times I felt that the movie was just as far-fetched as the movie ""2012"". The disaster catches you by seconds, and it keeps happening over and over again. Their indescribable luck was not nearly as annoying as what you get to see in the movie 2012, but it was pretty close. Other than that, the cast did their job pretty well, the cinematography was excellent, and the acting was nearly perfect.

122,CelluloidDog,Brilliant Thriller: Ordinary People Make Mistakes,9,22 March 2011,"First, only a 7.4 cumulative rating on IMDb?! I think it should rate 8.0-8.1 overall. This thriller may very well be the best one of the last 10-15 years. I imagine some people didn't like it since it doesn't try to grab you by the seat much like Inception or like the Bourne Identity. It's more sophisticated, perhaps too much for most people. So when you watch it, don't expect to fall out of your seat with overacting, special effects or great car chases. It's about being ordinary in almost ordinary situations. What devotion and love can make us do.We all know about Murphy's Law. That's this film. How ordinary people make mistakes. And it's also about how we create our own luck and destiny. Russell Crowe gives a solid performance (not his best) but Elizabeth Banks is outstanding in her role. Liam Neeson and Brian Dennehey were terrific in their supporting cameo/roles. I agree with some that the son Luke (Ty Simkins) could have been a better actor...a bit flat. Crowe plays ordinary teacher John Brennan who is frustrated with the justice system as he feels his wife is wrongly imprisoned. His family and friends think he isn't realistic (his lawyer and wife gets frustrated at his failure to see what other people see as the truth). He appears to live in denial and tries to be a hero. Everything he does appears to fail. About two-thirds of the way through, we see him as a anti-Bourne or anti-Bond. John (Crowe's role) just can't things right. A bit pathetic which might turn off some people. And to go through his plan...well, sometimes you just need to be in the zone and with a little luck, things work out. Take a deep breath and just do it.The great climax is the anti-climax of most action movies. We always look for car chases but rather the car scene in this movie is not a chase but a roadside mishap towards the end when John and Lara Brennan are fleeing without their son. Take in that scene and understand the movie. Just brilliantly emotional. Haggis shows genius. It's as good as Crash or Million Dollar Baby with a better story/script but it doesn't have that special appeal of his other movies which gets acclaim.In a way, it's like The Town, but it is superior except for Jeremy Renner who was brilliant in The Town. For comparison, yes, it is better than the cheesy Fugitive (chasing a man with one arm, etc) with the however brilliant Tommy Lee Jones. But I think that is the sole problem with The Next Three Days. It has very good acting by Elizabeth Banks and Russell Crowe with great directing by Paul Haggis. But it lacks a over-the-top performance like Jeremy Renner, ala James Cagney. So people feel it's just an ordinary thriller.Yet, that makes this thriller excellent. It's a philosophical, emotional movie about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. There are no superheroes. Just ordinary people being heroes. We make mistakes and sometimes things go right when you need them.",The Next Three Days
123,petit76,Piece of Director ingenuity,10,6 April 2011,I was a bit iffy to watch this movie since there were not enough eye popping advertisements with the advent of this movie . I was expecting a dull and dreary premise with quite an average acting from Russell Crowe however i was captivated with this movie from the start till the credits rolled. I ended up grinding my teeth and patiently waiting what next would have happened. A man's unfortunate life span is besieged by many mishaps and his wife's falsely being incarcerated. In the brink of an entire family falling apart like a big truck rips up a smooth golf course. John is a professor at a university and the movie pretty much starts when he quotes irrationalism and life forming around rational and irrational facts. When the movie advances to John's meticulous plan to flee his wife from the state prison he enacts all the irrationalism he has conquered to baffle all the law enforcement officials who follow up rational order of things. His putting up the blueprints of his runaway plan on the walls of his evicted house and police finding the piece of evidence purposely thrown in the dumpster is another way of thinking of irrational. it is worth watching every second of this movie.

That's what separates and defines our motivational factors as human beings living in an uncertain world where not everything is securely in our grasp.The Brennan family gets a rude awakening when the wife gets arrested and the book slammed shut for cold blooded murder. Did she do it? Well, the community college teacher of a husband stands by to protect her despite the evidence being stacked. He's not a lawyer and he doesn't have friends in high places, but this everyday man does have enough determination to create a scheme to see his wife out one way or another. Enough to break a rule or even ten getting there.""The Next Three Days"" steadily paces as a drama/thriller. Russell Crowe's character goes through a number of emotional stages and encounters various people along the way, including those who are willing to help him, stop him or just plain got caught in the middle. There are some motivations glossed over as to how he got from point A to B, partly to give a continuous stream of action towards the latter portion to keep a viewer in the moment and from guessing the outcome. Those attempting to hamper his plan are unrealistically suspicious and coincidentally one step on top or behind to amp up the energy. It creates an escalating climax, but still feels manipulated to go a certain way by falling too much into the hands of the filmmakers to make this more marketable.At the heart of it, the story manages to give something empowering back to those who've ever had an injustice against them, from getting robbed, laid off, cheated or, here, a loved one getting taken away and no chance of getting them back unless, that is, something's done about it.

130,gamay9,Prison v. jail,8,28 April 2013,"This is a good film with excellent acting. However, the thing that disturbed me is the confusion people have regarding jail and prison. The defendant was CONVICTED by a jury of her peers, although the trial is totally disregarded. She's arrested and the next thing we know is that she's in jail appealing her conviction. The last resort is the supreme court. The movie doesn't explain whether it's the Pennsylvania or U.S. supreme court. The fact is that a defendant who is convicted has to go through the state supreme court before resorting to the U.S. supreme court.During the appeal process, the defendant somehow remains in the Allegheny county jail. After a murder conviction, one goes directly to prison, even if appealing the conviction. But, she stays in jail. In many European jurisdictions, jail means the same as prison, but this is the U.S., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania specifically. Hollywood producers can't seem to get the difference between jail and prison. Jail is where one stays until the trial is over or if the sentence is one year or less. Prison is where one stays if the sentence is over one year. It doesn't vary much from state to state.Why is this important to the story? I am a retired DEA and I just want to get citizens to understand the difference between the county jail and prison.The ending is confusing to some; but, it's quite simple. Venezuela does not have an extradition treaty with the U.S. But, in conclusion, the family is broke and would be treated as indigents in that country. They would be safer in Chavez Ravine than under Hugo Chavez or his predecessor.

What I can say is that this movie was deftly directed with a perfect pacing that smoothly shifts through each gear from 1 to full throttle. It starts off with the necessary slow exposition, transitioning to a heartfelt family crisis drama and crime thriller with the tension slowly cranking up to a breakneck speed when I was literally holding my breath in the compelling edge of the seat finale.What I admire most about this film is the smooth kinetic flow from scene to scene. There didn't seem to be any implausible leap in logic apart from maybe towards the end but everything just connects together so well. All of the actors were superb in their roles. As for Russel Crowe, well I can't think of many actors who expresses wordless undying love better than he can. He is simply a master of it and you just cant help root for him even if he makes or contemplates morally wrong decisions. His character is beautifully played with all the invulnerability, weaknesses and stubborn obsession he possesses.The supporting actors were all excellent in the little screen time that they each get. And there is even a brilliant cameo by a well known Irish actor (shant spoil who it is for you) that sparked up the screen briefly in an instrumental role to the plot. The great Brian Denhhey also has a few minutes on screen time as Crowes father, hardly uttering a word but you just know exactly what is going on in his mind and it is absolutely touching. So in summary, this is a top thriller with an exhilarating edge of the seat 3rd act, enriched by beautifully touching moments and thick underlying subtext of undying love.",The Next Three Days

One thing I did find, I didn't care in the end if she was guilty or not, this may have been deliberate, and if so perfectly OK, though the need at the end to tie it all up left me feeling a bit, amiss, I think it could have been excluded and a far better ending made. When you see the last shot, you will know what I mean! That aside, I enjoyed this film, it would not get many followers at a cinema, but as a DVD it should have plenty, and I would recommend it as a watch!!",The Next Three Days

138,TourettesPersonal,Afternoon Entertainment,6,25 December 2010,"""The Next Three Days"" isn't the kind of film that is worth it in a cinema. It's more like a movie you'll watch when you're bored in afternoon.The story is interesting and it has big stars. The trailer attracts a lot of action movie fans. Actually ""The Next Three Days"" is not fully an action movie. It's more of a drama thriller.It's still entertaining though, and the performances of Russel Crowe & Elizabeth Banks were decent.

I childishly resented Paul Haggis because 'Crash' beat 'Brokeback Mountain' at the Oscars.. but whatever I had against the man, I completely take it back, because 'The Next Three Days' is in my opinion a piece of work from a true master of the form.Also check out '3:10 To Yuma', another massively under appreciated film with Crowe.",The Next Three Days
141,macktan894,What we do for love!,9,19 November 2010,"Screenwriters are told that actors choose scripts by reading the first and last ten pages. If the role is any good, the character you meet in the first act evolves into someone else by the end of the film. Russell Crowe's character, John, takes that kind of journey. Most know this movie is about a community college English teacher whose wife is accused of murdering her boss and is convicted as a result. Exhausting appeals, John, who believes in his wife's innocence despiteevidence to the contrary, decides to take matters into his own hands. To do so, he must navigate the netherworld of crime and become a student of you tube crime videos to become a criminal sharp enough to break his wife out of prison. Without the internet, where would we be?The first act is a highly compressed, somewhat slow set up for John's criminal development. We see how happy John and Laura are, how devoted to their baby, then suddenly the police rush into their home and swoop up his wife. Life changes instantly. We are spared the trial and move into a few years later when the last appeal -- denied-- seals Laura's fate. Her suicide attempt motivates John into action. Tutored by the man with ""a highly specialized skill set,"" Taken star Liam Neeson, John is warned about what he's going to have to do and and the kind of man he must be to pull this off. I thought the movie was well done and quite thrilling with a lot of twists and turns. Yes, a few of the cinematic techniques are recognizable ""tradecraft,"" that Haggis could have tried to spin a bit differently--movie buffs will instantly know what's happening during the airport chase--but still, he's done it well and the experience was no less suspenseful. My only complaint is that Crowe doesn't emote much throughout the film, so you don't see a noticeable dramatic transformation in his character--say from a Clark Kent to a Superman, or from a kid brother Michael to a Godfather Michael Corleone. Russell Crowe has been in so many action movies that we all are used to him being a character that gets the job done. If it had been my choice, I would have cast a more unlikely actor, perhaps a Ryan Gosling, an actor for whom action or superhero status has not been the norm. Doing so would have made John's character evolution more impressive.Even though the film relies on many of the standard suspense elements for this kind of film, The Next Three Days was highly entertaining and as fun to watch as The Town. For those curious about its remake status, it is based on the 2008 French film called Pour Elle, or Anything for Her, and is nearly a duplicate. I've seen the film and it's just as good as the remake.",The Next Three Days

A script with plot twists that would have to stretch to be on the level of a cartoon.

149,eucalyptus9,Riveting viewing,9,31 May 2011,"I'd heard disparaging comments about this film, some even comparing it unfavorably to shoddy movies like ""Law Abiding Citizen"". I watched it in anticipation of two potential flaws. One, it was long, about the two hour mark, and it's rare that a film can hold my attention for that long without a few peeks at my watch along the way. Secondly, American remakes of European films don't tend to work well - ""Brothers"" is a case in point, where the US movie wasn't all that bad, it just paled in every way with the Danish original.But not this movie. It was clever, exciting, and kept the viewer's eyes riveted to the screen - no clock-watching here. I haven't seen ""Pour Elle"" the French original, but I doubt that it could be any better than this. Congratulations to director Paul Haggis.There are several factors in favor of the film, predominant among these being that it has Russell Crowe. Crowe delivered a few ho-hum performances in some ho-hum films - ""American Gangster"" for instance - but seems to have found his mojo again. He was good in ""3:10 to Yuma"", excellent in ""State of Play"", I liked his ""Robin Hood"", and in this he's just outstandingly good, clearly stamping him as the most charismatic male actor on screen today. There's a remarkably strong performance from Elizabeth Banks as well.The plot is well-written and clever, with some devious moments. It's all implausible, of course, but not stupidly implausible to the extent of, say, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" or ""Taken"". The dialog is smart and snappy with occasional vignettes of humor (John, talking to his son Luke about a fight at school: ""Where did you hit him?"" Luke: ""On the playground"". John: ""Oh. That must've hurt."") I liked the allusion to Don Quixote, with the parallels between John and the Don, each living in his fantasy world which he convinces himself is, or can be, reality.The cinematography and editing is similarly excellent. I don't usually notice such esoteric features, but there were some outstanding scenes such as John pursuing the drug dealer in his car. The camera pans to a closeup of John, then to the windscreen and to John's point of view. Then back to John, then back again to his POV and a completely new image. Back to John, then back to another new image. It might be simple, but it was highly effective.I really enjoyed this film. The implausible nature of the movie would probably have limited it to 8/10, but Crowe is so good I give it 9.",The Next Three Days

The tension is kept from beginning to end, and there are definitely some smart moves made by the husband John (Russell Crowe). Nevertheless, if the creators did want to try and win some ""masterpiece"" price, the only single ""motive"" of successfully managing to fulfill the impossible dream and alter reality should have failed instead of this typical Hollywood ""happy ending"".For example, the movie could end up more realistically (sorry for that kids...) if when Lara takes her head out of the car, she is killed by the truck, or better - when she and John sit by the car on the highway, they decide to give themselves up. You are invited to see the much better movie - ""The Counselor"" as an example of such ending when a (future) husband tries hopelessly to save his fiancé, which got a 10 from me.",The Next Three Days

Well, let's see, he needs money so why not just go rob drug dealers!

Suspense thriller with emotional play: The next three days 2010You need to watch this excellent movie with stellar performances of Russel Crowe and Elizabeth Banks to see how to make a suspense thriller with a murder accused a working lady falsely sentenced and her husband a College professor evolving a detailed plan for her prison break. The movie with excellent jump editing , flashbacks with a non linear storytelling is both gripping and an emotional roller coaster showing the different hues of emotions the family of three goes through ...

156,EskimoChain,Acting out the Grind.. More People Need to See this Movie!,10,21 November 2010,"Coming in at Little more than two hours. ""The next three days"", moves fast and tough. My Hat is off to Mr.Crowe especially.He carries this movie very well. His depiction of John Brennan is very good. A man in the middle of a real mess of a life, The movie moves fast so before you know it, the nitty gritty reality of the situation is in effect very soon. It doesn't lag at all. Showing at a little over 2 hours, The Next three Days doesn't rest in showing the full blown restlessness of the Two main character's development. Which shows the talent from Crowe and actually more so in Elizabeth Banks. Who really stole the movie. Her scenes are short and sweet. Yet the range of emotion you see from her generates real mystery and sincerity. Sitting front row center I never really miss much in a Picture. I sat patiently grinding my teeth with eyes bulging from the strong real magnetic draw I felt in this movie. Sipping the bitter sweet HI-c Pink lemonade which was how the Movie felt as well.I never like to give anything away in any of my reviews. Just the reactions I had felt watching it. It's hard to concentrate when let's say someone won't stop coughing, is on their cell phone, or better yet has a digital watch going off every 15 minutes clockwork. In the end I don't feel I really missed anything watching this. It is hard for a short attention span to really waver from this one. If I had it my way the Surroud sound would be as loud as possible, but Hey .. you can't win them all. Anyway I come to understand that Paul Haggis (The writer and Director) Sure knows how to Create a honest, true to life motion picture. Getting older I can now sympathize more so with the plot and true to life situation. I don't know why the people who work for the LionsGate or whoever is responsible for the release date, chose to put it out the same day as the new ""Harry Potter"" was released. Unless your Christopher Nolan, Spielbeg or maybe James Cameron you just can't match up. Nonetheless it is a extremely tense and thrilling movie on it's own. Liam Neleson was fantastic as usual It would have been nice to give him a couple extra scenes, since his part of this film is a real strong spark which get's the film on the ground and running. Olivia Wilde Made her mark as a good friend and model neighbor, so she was quite important in this one. Lastly Ty Simpkins he did well too, as the Son who naive to world was yet very favorable to what he wants and knows is right. Once again I extract these things from the film as I see them trying not to give anything away.All in all highly recommended. ""See it twice and call me in the morning."" Good work all around I don't what it takes out of Russell Crowe to make a movie like this and be in a real honest form, seemingly on the verge of a nervous break the entire time. I really felt for the man. And I think you will too. So go out and see this movie. I guess after Harry Potter, but I had seen it before.",The Next Three Days

In the beginning, it was quite difficult to really understand why the wife was a suspect, it all just happened without any lead into the events. The main character is so clumsy and inept he is unbearable at times. Its just unbelievable that anybody so hopeless could pull off anything. And when he does do something he doesn't wear a mask or do anything to prevent his car being tracked. Come on! Lost count of how many times he went on a prison visit and how many times they both looked sorrowfully at each other. OK we get it. Its a plot story not a love story so get on with it.They continued to look sorrowfully throughout the film. It perked up about half way through.

158,Caribstu,Intriguing thriller,10,11 January 2011,"The Next Three Days The best films are those where you are introduced to characters who do the unpredictable believably, or people you think will be key players die in the opening scene, someone you least expect turns out to be the murderer, these are the films that keep you guessing and keep you involved. In Paul Haggis' intense thriller he chooses a wise and well crafted angle to lure you in and hold your attention. The development of John Brennan and his gradual transformation over time before your very eyes.Meet John Brennan, he's a normal average working man, slightly nerdy even, living a fairly dull routine life. When his wife is imprisoned for murder John, as you would expect of a normal average slightly nerdy working man follows the rules of appeal in an attempt to win her freedom. Three years pass and the realisation that his wife will remain behind bars for life hits home. When normal people find themselves in hopeless situations desperation can drive them to do very abnormal things. What Haggis works brilliantly into both his screenplay and direction is the gradual metamorphosis of Brennan's persona as he becomes fixated on breaking his wife out of prison. Brennan doesn't suddenly become the all American action hero capable of great feats of courage. We have a knowledge of his character from the beginning of the film and Haggis does not treat the audience as idiots, we know that Brennan cannot walk into a phonebox and there's a sudden change into superman. This would not work for John Brennan, the nerdy schoolteacher, what we see however is how little by little, piece by piece he falls more and more out of control, deeper and deeper out of his depth. We know this is not the normal behaviour of Brennan, but the screenplay is so well crafted and Crowe delivers the character to us perfectly that both the scenarios and Brennan remain at all times, believable. He makes tremendous mistakes and shows real human failings and frailties that as we ride along with him we're never far from the belief that it will all go very wrong, very soon. Haggis treats us to a wonderfully woven story that rolls along with ease, then suddenly the momentum builds into a Tsunami of real tension. Brennan is completely exposed and you fear for his outcome. If a director can pull you into the story, make you care about a character, and if during the course of that film allow you to watch that character change in a very real and gradual way then he has delivered a truly great film.Haggis' screenplay does not allow the audience to get ahead of the story. Developments are unexpected and plausible scenarios affect action and reaction. Some events have no bearing on the outcome but you cannot know which are red herrings and which are genuine avenues rather you find yourself wondering where this will all lead to, making The Next Three Days a complex and intriguing thriller very much in the cerebral and classical sense such as North by Northwest or Vertigo. A tremendous, faultless film.10/10",The Next Three Days

Elizabeth Banks' character, Lara Brenen, does have a turbulent relationship with her boss, a female. The next morning, after a typical family breakfast and getting ready to work/school, the cops bust in, with an arrest warrant for Lara for murdering said female boss in a parking lot by striking her with a fire extinquisher. The evidence is circumstantial. 3 years later, having exhausted all legal appeals, Lara is sentenced to life. Russell Crowe's John Brenen, the everyman school-teacher husband is understandibly having a hard time to be apart from his wife, and she is beautiful indeed. Any man who has such a wife will be in despair, surely. John talked with an ex-con who was a jail-break artist. He gave him all the tips down to the timing where police will quarantee the exits. Slowly John hatched his plan to free his wife. I will not spoil the story by telling you what happens next. There are tight sequences when the couple is trying to escape, along with their small son. Unlike other action films where you don't care if good guys or bad guys get away, I really wanted the couple to get away. Some minor flaws leak out. How does an ordinary man sudden become super hero-like character, busting a drug house(!) ""The Taxi Driver"" like, breaking into places at ease, and evading the police so expertly? And why does the boy has to be so dour upon seeing his freed mother after 3 yr ? However If you keep your focus on the frantic flight taken by a desperate family you'll will overlook these discrepancies. The 2nd part of the movie when John kicked in his jail-break plan really keeps you on edge of your seat and routing for the family on the run.

I first saw ""Anything For Her"" a couple of years ago and thought it was a great thriller, with a depth and mood found often in French films and so seldom in Hollywood productions. When I heard that Hollywood I was doing a remake, I was almost sure it was going to be another mistake, like most cross-border remakes turn out to be... Think ""The Man with One Red Shoe"", ""Three Men And A Baby"", ""Buddy Buddy"", and many others. ""The Next Three Days"" is the exception. It retains the mood and depth of the French original. Maybe the fact that the original screenwriter has co-written the script helped to make this such an exception.

164,gtylerpayne,Under-rated movie... intense action and thought provoking,9,18 September 2016,"When it comes to thrilling action movies, this one really had it all for me. It is VERY suspenseful, and maintains a good pace throughout. And not only is it thrilling, but it also gave me lots to think about long after the credits rolled.Russell Crowe plays John, a man whose wife is convicted of murder. He is convinced that she is innocent and becomes determined to break her out of jail. This creates a lot of suspenseful situations as soon as he starts to prepare. It got me thinking about a lot of things, including the moral dilemmas John faces.There is a great Liam Neeson cameo where he gives John advice, since he has escaped from prison several times before. He warns John of the intense hurdles and sacrifices he will have to make, so I very quickly realized that the stakes and risk are very high if he goes through with it. The fact that I don't know if the wife is actually innocent or not, adds another layer of depth to the story. I was left trying to decide if John is making the right choice to break her out, which forced me to try and decide if she actually did it. Being so unsure how to feel, it really drew me in, and got me paying attention to every little detail in the movie. Haggis is great at throwing in little clues and nuances in the performances that made me question and re-think things.John is obviously a good guy, so I was rooting for him to succeed, but it is hard to know how to really feel about his character. Russell Crowe is great at playing characters that seem slightly insane, and it's hard to decide just how crazy he really is. They have a son, around 10 years old, and this makes his decisions all the more important. He is risking leaving this kid with both parents in jail if he screws up, but it will also re-unite the kid with his mother, who may be innocent.Overall, it is a very clever movie that is well crafted. The biggest strong point for me is really the script. It's a smart script that is well thought through. I can tell that Haggis understands what the viewer will be thinking and feeling during the experience and he times things perfectly to make for a fun, exciting, and thoughtful experience.Beside the writing, the acting was also very good. Russell Crowe brought a lot of depth to the character. The only criticism I have is that it is somewhat hard to believe that he would actually do this. He seems like a little bit too soft and reserved of a character to do these things, but in a way, that adds to the suspense because it makes us more unsure if he will pull it off. Elizabeth Banks is pretty good as the wife. I'm a little unsure how to feel about her performance. My main problem with her is that I didn't really like her character very much, she comes across as a bitch. I understand why that needs to be an element of her performance, but I would have liked to learn a little more about her positive traits to understand why John loves her so much. I think a few tweaks to her character development and a little more edge to John's character, could have increased how believable the story is. The only other criticism I can think of, is that Haggis clearly is a great writer who understands the story and did a fabulous job directing the actors and their actions, but there is not a lot of creativity or style in the way things were filmed. The camera work and cinematography was mostly pretty straight forward, and I would have liked to see a little more creativity in that department. Maybe some extreme close-ups, or interesting angles and framing. I would have liked to see Haggis hire a cinematographer that brought a little more to the table to make this movie a great visual experience in addition to being a great emotional experience.If you like intense movies that keep you on your toes and give you lots to think about, don't miss this one!",The Next Three Days

Russell Crowe plays a community college professor who clearly has no idea on how he is going to get his wife out of the slammer, and has to rely on books, scumballs, YouTube videos on how to make skeleton keys, etc., in order to develop a plan. The most realistic part of this film is that Russell doesn't turn into some criminal mastermind, some of his attempts blow up in his face, and a lot of the people he trusted turn out to be scumbags who take advantage of him. The ending is very well done, as is the overall acting and plot of the film.",The Next Three Days

168,piverba,Rationality is overrated - then what?,6,8 March 2011,"This feature is shameless remake of the french version ""ANYTHING FOR HER"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217637/ of 2008, as was noted by other posts, however I prefer this, later version. What escapes my understanding is why there was a need to plagiarize the french version? This is engaging and manipulative film bursting with platitudes, like alcohol or a cigarette, it will relax you with cathartic ending. It is about unconditional love, family and individual against state and society. It could had been done better, but it is wasn't. Crowe's pleasing, as always and Banks looks pretty.To make the discussion more serious several themes / issues can be considered. (a) Law and its violation - can it be avoided to condemn innocent? How do we know if someone's innocent? Obviously, through the logical deduction (hopefully sound). Can we afford to have one innocent condemned person in prison? Would it rather be better to free 100 guilty instead? Crowe as a teacher questions his students' value of logic in Don Quixote. His standing by his wife is an expression of supra-logical belief in her innocence. (b) What is true love that compels the husband to risk his own life in order to free his wife. Is it right what he did, or wrong? What is the basis for our moral judgment? I found germs of interesting ideas to be pondered but very little in their development. The ending, no matter how cute, presented questions: what's now? What if the same thing will happen to them in their new country? How long they will hide? What the meaning of their life and how they will re-embed into society? The low score reflects the lack for development and shameless copying of previous french version.",The Next Three Days
169,jacobson98,Disappointed,6,26 February 2011,"Russell Crowe may be our best movie actor so I was anxious to see this film. Alas, the film is a disappointment.Russell Crowe tries his best to show an ordinary man finding the strength in himself to engage in behavior he finds morally reprehensible. But he's not helped much by the script and direction. The film makers obscure points to lengthen a ""mystery"" atmosphere and those obscure plot points make the film difficult to follow.I was so disappointed that I searched out and watched the 2008 French Film, Pour Elle, that was the basis for the film. The American film is pretty much a steal of the original but adds an additional layer of complexity in additional characters and story lines that reduces the impact of the film. The French film emphasizes key plot points with script, cinematography, music, etc., while, as mentioned before, the American version tends to obscure them. Most importantly, in its first two scenes the French film shows why the hero is willing to throw away his normal existence for the sake of his wife. In the American film, you never quite see that.All in all, a miss.",The Next Three Days

It has a perfect pace and it does not feel forced or predictable at any point. The tone of the movie and the groundwork is set in such a way that you could see the story going in any number of directions everytime there is a twist in the story line. This is owed to the wonderful writing and the immensely well crafted performance of Russell Crowe. The movie is truly carried by him, seeing how 95% of the time his face is in the frame, and he really makes it worth your time, displaying so clearly and passionately his state of mind you feel like a fly in his characters head, you can almost see the thoughts bounce in there. The writing is superb, all the actors play their part terrifically and did I mention the timing is perfect? It's slow where it's supposed to be and fast where it's needed. You don't feel it rushed or unfinished or unnecessary in any way and the character development simply works, which plays a big part in having you at the edge of your seat by the end.

Their dialog is generic and predictably Hallmark-like. There's generic grandparents - grandma is of course doting and grandpa is of course cold and closed-off.

180,alerter,a rare American remake that doesn't dishonor or diminish the original -- by being every bit as good,8,15 November 2010,"Consider yourself an every day type of person? If you're married, how well do you really know your spouse? Beyond every shadow of any doubt? And just far would you go to save her/him from a gross miscarriage of justice, after every legal recourse has failed? Could you forsake all of your worldly possessions? Would you be willing to leave behind your one and only old child, a six year old, as part of the price of freedom? Willing to risk being shot on sight? What about always wondering if law enforcement is going to kick down your door in the middle of the night? Going on the run requires money and money always runs out when on the run.Can you live with *all* of that? If you can't...All of the above fueled the well received 2008 French crime thriller, Anything for Her, the directorial debut of screenwriter Fred Cavayé. Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days is the American remake, trading Paris/Europe for Pittsburgh/North America -- and Cavayé is very pleased by all of that.Three years. That's the time interval over which Russell Crowe's sheepish, straight arrow, community college English lit professor, John Brennan, has to reckon with his wife Lara's (Elizabeth Banks) sudden arrest and quick conviction for the brutal parking lot murder of her boss. In the absence of new evidence, every viable avenue of appeal is now exhausted. The pace of the film in this section is deliberately slow, like a wet fuse that threatens to quit with every sputter, provoking the patience of some audience members, in the same way that these three years have worn down John, Lara and their six year old son Luke.Three weeks. Facing life in prison without possibility of parole, Lara attempts suicide. Failing that, she chides John for never once having asked her if she committed the crime, strongly implying that his steadfast belief in her innocence is wrong. It's a startling, hardboiled moment. John rocks Lara to the verge of tears with a fiercely gentle insistence that he knows her far better than that. Then he calmly promises her that the rest of her life won't be spent in prison. John means it and that ignites a second, measured fuse of searching, plotting, tinkering and flailing to get her out, by any means necessary.Three days. Seventy-two hours notice is given that Lara is to be moved out of county lockup to a remote state prison. All of John's site-specific preparations to spring Lara are about to go up in smoke. Heaping measures of white-hot desperation and sheer dumb luck fuel a now go-for-broke, chutes-and-ladders prison break action/thriller. Obtaining run money, forged passports, drivers licenses and credit-worthy stolen identities are beyond the grasp of mild manners. There's no more time for any more half-measures. Will they or won't they beat the 15/35 minute municipal lockdown perimeters? Will Luke be left behind? Will they get away or will they be caught? Even if you think you know, you never know just how.In the Three Weeks section, John's Internet searches lead him to Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), an author who has written a book about his experience escaping from prison seven times. In the French original, Pennington's counterpart becomes a directly engaged mentor to the protagonist for an extended portion of the story. Director/writer Haggis boils the role down to a single, compelling scene, in which Neeson's Pennington primes Crowe's John for what will be an arduous and profoundly solitary quest to become a desperately competent escape artist. Neesom sells it without resorting to any Obi-Wan Kenobi/Yoda/Qui-Gon artifice, and then he is gone.At points, the film threatens to lose it's way over YouTube-for-Dummies tutorials on bump keys and tennis ball pneumatic plungers, but then quickly reestablishes a coherent context in the service of story. (It's a minor blessing that the bump key prominently shown on screen isn't fit for real-world duty.) Haggis' emphasis is on John's native intelligence and his refusal to engage any co-conspirators (not even Lara). John's fallibility, desperation and nagging decency (when escrow on the family home won't close in time, he can't bring himself to rob a bank) all work against, as much as for, Lara's and his own sake. The psychological wear and tear of John's solitary second life all plays up to a poignant father-son scene, between Brian Dennehy and Crowe, that can be taken either way as slip-up or shrewd intention.Yes, there are a few almost unbelievable moments, but cleverness and luck are the deciding factors here, just as they sometimes are in real life.The success or failure of tN3D as entertainment depends entirely on three things, all of them acting, Crowe and Banks and the supporting cast filling out the seriously tenacious law enforcement roles.None of the smart intricacies of Haggis' script work without the uniformly excellent contributions of all the actors, particularly Crowe, who carries the film with the tenacity of a gladiator, while relying mostly on the finer muscles of intimate character acting. Banks encapsulates a woman's who is always tough to love, but who is all the more to be loved for it, even when she's totally glammed down. Lara's got a tough exterior, but, inside, she's on the brink of quitting.Danny Elfman's score is beautifully restrained and subtle, too. I had no idea it was his work until I saw the end credits.Haggis makes quite a living out of polishing the scripts of other writers that somehow got greenlit despite being turds. This remake is completely able to stand on its own, as well as stand in good comparison with the French original. Cavayé is quoted as saying that he is honored by Haggis and can't wait to see tN3D himself. How often does that happen? I'm glad I caught this one. It's very good entertainment.",The Next Three Days

182,seanebuckley,The Next Three Days is a thriller of the highest quality.,7,11 April 2012,"Director Paul Haggis has carved out a cosy little niche for himself crafting sublime hyper real melodramas for the discerning film fan. Here he spins a yarn so outlandish that its run time should be filled with superfluous explosions and dim witted one liners; needless to say it isn't. Russell Crowe again plays the reliable everyman and when his beloved wife is accused of murder his resolve is tested as he sets out to first prove her innocence and then to break her out of prison.The films tone is decidedly muted despite the obvious brashness of the plotting, a fact that gives the film most of its weight. We watch Crowe as he struggles internally with his predicament instead of running or shooting through it. As trite as it sounds, The Next Three Days is an old school thriller. Crowe's performance reminded me of Glenn Fords commanding Det. Sgt. Dave Bannion from the magical 1953 film The Big Heat. Here he has Bannion's quiet and restrained violence, there are a few moments when Crowe threatens to lose his cool and blow the whole darn plot wide open but he doesn't, he knows what's best.The ambiguity of his wifes guilt is treated with intelligence as Haggis is well aware that there is much more fun to be had from watching Crowe rescue a woman that may actually be guilty than to retread familiar the ropes. Also, this adds to the connection we feel to Crowe as he never questions his wifes innocence, this not because Crowe believes her to be angelic but simply because he loves her and it makes complete sense to fight for that, rightly or wrongly. In one of the films stronger moments we watch as Russell Crowe's John Brennan toys with his students and the audience as he bleeds 'Could it be about how rational thought destroys your soul? Could it be about the triumph of irrationality and the power that is in that?' Here Brennan lays his anima for all to see and plants parallels between the film and the topic of the classroom discussion, Don Quixote.One of the films shortcomings is one that has been a defining feature of Hollywood since its inception. It's the idea of star power with specific regards to recent fads in Hollywood 'leading' women. Here the presently popular Elizabeth Banks plays the pivotal role of Crowes accused wife. Just to be clear, I don't think that Banks will ever have the acting chops to be able to pull off the nuanced performance required here. Don't get me wrong I think she is fine, but you get the feeling it's never quite as subtle and engaging as it could be. Here Banks plays it safe, when the screenplay calls for her to be sweet and endearing then she is just that and visa versa when she needs to be the villain of the piece. What is needed is an emotional thread tying the various moods and modes to a single character or idea. A superb example of this is Charlize Theron's performance in 'Young Adult' whilst it is not entirely successful film; you really get a sense that you're watching an actual person on screen rather than a cinematic by-product, her character could just pop off the screen and walk around quite (un)happily. Banks just goes right for the cinematic version of her character, the one that she grew up watching and admiring. Obviously then with a string of recognisable roles behind her; Banks seems to have been chosen more for bums on seats rather than her acting ability. I have exactly the same feelings when watching Cameron Diaz prance around in the much maligned 'Gangs Of New York' it feels more like a producers choice rather than an artistic one.The Next Three Days is a rare breed, a film that manages to be both thoughtful and exciting, to be seemingly both high and low art simultaneously. It is a praise usually saved for Christopher Nolan and his particular brand of blockbuster but I wont waste my time comparing the various merits of both directors. However, I will say that it continues to be refreshing to see someone who is intent on making something which is equal parts emotionally/anthropologically engaging as it is cinematic and thrilling.7.3 out of 10.",The Next Three Days
183,mistramicizia,A movie that shows a character changing drastically for the ones they love,9,12 July 2018,"When I first heard about this movie, I didn't really think about watching it because I thought the romantic aspect would be exaggerated with pointless love scenes that deviate from the tone of the movie. However, after watching this movie, I can tell that it has a little bit of everything, so no one could be left dissatisfied. What I liked about this movie is, apart from the slow, but intense build up to the ending scenes, that there was a bitter taste throughout the entire movie. It is almost as if you can sympathize with the characters and see the difficulties they have to overcome. At some moments the movie is really poignant and the feeling of hopelessness prevails. The movie also shows Russell Crowe's incredible acting range, where he surprises with yet another delivery which was unexpected from the actor. The other actors also played their roles convincingly, which had an important role in building the atmosphere. I haven't watched the French version, but I would highly recommend this one, as it should be at least a little bit likeable for just about anyone.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers",The Next Three Days

186,LinJason,The Next Three Days could have been better and more.,6,27 November 2010,"Coming directly from a highly acclaimed film-maker, Paul Haggis tries his hands on an action thriller remake of the French original ""Pour Elle"" with a questionable take on it. Cast performance is generally well although the casting choice isn't. An adequate film of its genre that contains some finely detailed plot elements of crime, it will keep you off the tracks of predictability if you have yet seen the original.Before the first frame of this film is screened, I enter the theatre with the impression of Paul Haggis' incredible film resume of being the first person to write two consecutive Academy Awards Best Pictures back to back. He's directed and written 2004's ""Crash"" as well as writing Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" within the same year. Adding on to his credits are ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""In the Valley of Elah"".Now let the movie begin.It begins with a blood-tainted John in a car. Then it flashes back to a little heated conversation over a dinner as John tries to separate Lara from an escalated conflict with a lady whom she didn't like. Right after getting home, the police raids their residence and arrests Lara for murder.Seems like there isn't much to the background of the protagonists as it dives straight to John's perspective for the critical matter at hand. As a college teacher, John is an average educated citizen whose wife has been accused and convicted of murder and is serving her sentence in a County jail.A criminal conviction with an unknown integrity, which leaves you questioning her innocence.You are left to ponder over the rest of the film if Lara actually committed the crime as the film shapes your perception to intended play accordingly, very much like the effects of mass media these days. You either get bowled over or simply dismiss today's journalism, it's your call.Russell Crowe as Jack, a middle class school teacher, is really not convincing in my opinion. Perhaps due to his rugged demeanour and appearance, he looks as if he is the criminal right at the beginning of the film. I simply do not connect these two dots: College teacher and Russell Crowe. Not that Crowe is a bad actor, which he is in fact a good veteran in what he does, it's just an issue of specific role suitability where better casting could have helped.What allowed Crowe to stay believable in character is Haggis' screenplay depiction. In a particular scene, Jack is seen throwing up after surviving a nervous episode at the County jail, a reminding notion that Jack is no hero. This was totally unexpected but it's definitely in favour of the audience.The rest of the cast has been under-utilised as they play second to Crowe's presence. Liam Neeson has a brief appearance as one who has escaped several times from jail, he is approached by Crowe for a prison break advisory. Banks spends most of her time behind bars, which we seldom get to see. This is where I say I don't really feel for most of the characters in this film.What if Neeson and Crowe switched roles? Food for thought.Haggis has scripted an extremely detailed screenplay that also depicts disturbingly clear visual hints of how certain crimes can be committed. By surfing Youtube for methods to break into vehicles, for an instance. So for those of you who are intending to bring along minors to a screening of this film, kindly make a mental note.Details have plagued the first half of the film where the prison break plan development gets the limelight and unfolds itself before the audience, which may be a little too draggy in some's opinions. This is most likely done to achieve realism and credibility, which every good writer loves to have. But when the action comes on, it is satisfying and good.Action scenes are the essence of this film.The action scenes do not just excite one's senses, it brings about this quality of unpredictability with well-scripted plot developments. This is noticed during a hospital escape scene Haggis staged in complexity that hints of brilliance. He has made Jack a thinking man who's placed under situational stress, whose plans are gradually materialised over the next hour or so. Looks like you don't have to be Michael Scofield (of Prison Break) to pull off a prison escape.Maybe being a teacher has its perks after all.But not all goes well in the plotted escape as random hindrance do come along to frustrate the plan to cause impromptu diversions, which comes as a huge plus point for me simply because a prison break, in actual fact, is not as simple and smooth going as it seems in movies.All in all, it is an adequate film of its genre with decent screenplay and action elements. This is of course accurate when you do not compare this to any of Haggis' prior works. The Next Three Days could have been better and more, however I still stand firm in faith of Haggis' talents.Everybody makes mistakes, once in a while.",The Next Three Days
187,another_girl_another_pla,It's Alright To Kill Some Drug Dealers..... in order to rescue a wise.,8,29 February 2012,"A husband who never believed his wise's murder charge risks everything to get her out of the jail. The movie was simply amazing. The love between a husband and a wife was described quite beautifully, it almost brought tears to my eyes when John said he believes she is innocent because he knows her. The plot was very original and very exciting, the scenes near the end is like running without stop, something happens in almost every single minute and 3 of them through the police lines in the last seconds. It would be probably hard for you to leave the screen especially when they started running in the last 30-40min.However, I have little problems with the moral of some scene, especially where John break into the house and kills two drug dealers. I understand John was desperate enough to break some law, and it was totally understandable if he just shoot some drug dealers and take their money without killing them. My moral crisis is ""Were those drug dealers really deserved to die?"" Sure they are criminal, sure they are guilty of some crimes for sure. But death? I just I don't know. In addition, John killed one drug dealer and is responsible for the death of other one, doesn't it make John criminal? I understand everything happens because the justice system wrongly accused his wife as a murderer in the first place, so the justice system, police, and the true murderer is the one to be accused. But in the movie, it's like he ""killed"" two drug dealers in order to rescue his wife, but it's alright because they are drug dealers!!Anyway the movie is exciting, thrilling, and heartwarming in some points with no sexual contents/not so much brutal descriptions/ no F words.

The casting could have used a nobody instead of him for that role, since it has no effect on the story. Russel Crow is good as usual but his role limits him to show his talent. His role is a very ordinary role that you see everyday in Hollywood... An educated Joe average type of guy in trouble , that's IT ! Elizabeth Banks was also fine for her part and did a fine job portraying a woman in trouble who is about to lose her family and everything.All and all I would say it was not a good movie. I was expecting something a bit more intellectual in which the main character is not a god of knowledge and intelligence and the rest would be just idiots who can not reach him ! This movie didn't do well in the box office either which is great prove for my opinion about this title ! The budget was 35 Millions USD but it made 21 millions USD in the box office. In Broadcast Management , we've been taught that it's called FAILURE !",The Next Three Days
195,chiefs3182,Not very good at all,4,7 October 2013,"From the acting, to the storyline, to the way everything happened, this movie was just not very good. A man's wife is sentenced to jail, and after all of the appeals fail, he decides to break her out. Since he has never done anything illegal in his life, this proves to be quite the endeavor. He makes many arrangements for life after getting her out, most of them very boring, and the whole escape is very poorly planned and not exciting at all. It is not a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. It is something that may hold your attention for the duration of the movie, but you will walk away saying, I'd have much rather tuned into something else. The acting wasn't terrible and it was a decent budget film so I will give it a 4.",The Next Three Days
196,matthewchermside,Clever Tension Building,8,11 July 2011,"There are few films that really keep one guessing about the potential ending all the way through - this one does just that extremely skilfully. It also has an incredible ensemble cast - the only drawback to this is that Liam Neeson and Brian Dennehy are criminally underused and in Neeson's only 10-minute scene he manages to outshine Crowe's entire performance, which was a little disappointing. The same cannot be said for Elizabeth Banks whose portrayal of the jailed wife is full of believable emotional depth.This film reminded me a little of 'The Assassination of Richard Nixon' in that it tries to show a character study of a man sinking to incredibly desperate lows to reclaim the life he once had. Crowe is never off the screen, which is a huge burden for any actor - to try and carry the whole film - and his performance, while not bad in any sense, does fall short of Sean Penn's highly disturbing portrayal.The 'cat-and-mouse' aspect of the ending was thrilling but ultimately gave way to a sugary ending. I felt that an 'Arlington Road' or 'Inception' style ending with a bit more ambiguity would have done it more justice.Definitely worth watching - don't miss it.",The Next Three Days

It's so irritating to watch what should be an entertaining movie when it is irritatingly obvious that the writers have no experience in incarceration. How does this guy visit on the daily?? Do they think you can just show up whenever you want and see someone in prison? Have they ever visited someone who is incarcerated? Have they read anything about it? Then, when is the last time you were stopped in a roadblock because the police were looking for someone? This wasn't Manson they were looking for, and even if it was, there's no way law enforcement moves this quickly. Perhaps it was a fantasy? Decent acting. Nice plot attempt.",The Next Three Days
198,KingAtor42,Interesting Jailbreak With Little Else,6,5 December 2010,"This movie had some real promise to it but ultimately it falls short in all of the areas that could have made it that much better.Let's start with the unusually wooden performance by the son. Given how much screen time he gets and the complexity of his role, I don't mean to bash him for being a young actor but he didn't deliver. It puzzled me that they went to lengths to get actors like Neeson and Dennehy for small roles but then skimp on getting a bigger child actor.The second fault is the films inability to truly sell the desperation of the main characters. The wife's suicide attempt and mini-psychotic break just didn't do enough to sell it to me. That in turn didn't translate to the husband. The entire impetus behind him acting so differently as to do some of the things he does wasn't there. The decision to focus more on the doubt of her innocence in the end was the wrong direction to go.Lastly, this film does little in the way of action or ingenuity. It is not an ingenious prison break movie. It has a weak and somewhat stunted buildup and this leads to a rather forced, sloppy jailbreak.I like to believe somewhere there was a cut that showed a harsher, darker jail leaf for his wife, a cooler jailbreak, and less focus on seemingly unneeded big names in tiny roles. It's good for a watch if you're a big heist/prison break type of person, but it's not among the better ones. It pales especially to Spike Lee's ""The Inside Man"", which featured impressive jobs by all 4 principles (Butler, Washington, Foster, Plummer) but combined a much more ingenious bank heist but the film itself goes to much deeper levels.6/10",The Next Three Days

200,mrbobke,Just too contrived and forced,3,29 July 2014,"I'm not sure at what point this movie lost me, but it was pretty early on. Certainly by the time the 'innocent' wife attempted suicide in jail, then told her husband that she did it, I had a hard time seeing what the point was in getting her out. Why would an innocent person attempt suicide? I found the character development overall pretty weak, and came away feeling that a couple of wackos risked the life of their zombie-like son in a highly irresponsible and foolhardy manner. There was something artificial about virtually every scene in this movie. The long drawn out scenes didn't draw me in, they felt more like that awkward moment of silence in a forced conversation. I can't say it was a terrible movie, the acting was solid, and there was some suspense towards the end. But it was just too sloppily put together to be believable.",The Next Three Days
201,imdb2-556-923983,Much better than we've come to expect,9,4 February 2011,"I really envy Paul Haggis his talent. (And perhaps this statement should also refer to the writers of ""Pour Elle"", which this is a remake of. I haven't seen it.) What makes this film stand out are (1) The economy of the script. Virtually all plot points and character development are communicated via no more than a single sentence, often by a simple nod or a well-placed camera. This is what scriptwriting is at its best. (2) It not asking you, in stark contrast to most films of the past year or more, to check in your brain at the door. Quite on the contrary, the script plays on the fact that our sense of criticism has been lulled by a slew of bad scripts with buffoons for protagonists, implausible and illogical plot points, and a reliance on CGI-driven art-major-physics in lieu of a plot. (3) For an action movie, it is strikingly humanistic. There are no bad guys. Everybody is doing his/her best to live life. There are no 2D characters. (In a film where nobody has more than a few on-screen moments, save for Russel Crowe, this is an amazing achievement, but all characters are fleshed out, likable and believable, and I rooted for every single one of them, cops and black-market hustlers alike. This is clearly by design: the use of a few strategically-placed Hollywood names, such as Liam Neeson, makes sure that even one-scene appearances leave a lasting impression.) (4) Because it's not about car chases. It's about people. It asks a simple question: how far will you be willing to go for the ones you love? The answer is not a simple one. Crowe's character, unlike most action heroes, doesn't implicitly assume that ends justify means, whilst leaving a trail of bodies behind him. Quite on the contrary. He needs to justify to himself each action he takes, and quite often his conclusions go against the grain of his ultimate goal. At no point is there loss of accountability on the part of any of the characters.Maybe its level of intensity isn't enough for it to rank among Hollywood's great classics, but I enjoyed it, and I miss the days when thrillers used to be as good as this. Most, these days, are junk.",The Next Three Days
202,sacflyzone,Very slow set up leads to thrilling finish,6,4 December 2010,"Russell Crowe has laid claim to the ""7/10"" movie spot this year at least. This is a film that's well done even though it's unique in the fact that about 75% of its running time is used to set up the final 25% of the film. Meaning, nothing really happens during the first two acts besides establishing character. Once the final act hits, it's definitely on and what follows is an interesting thrill ride. It's worth the tedious build up because the viewer is very much invested in what happens to these characters. The cast is wonderful and the movie is worth a watch.

To an extent, I would add, because I was expecting a lot more action (was expecting Taken-esque writing), and while the storyline and development was pretty good, the action kind of fizzles.

208,djp2000,One determined husband,8,18 November 2010,"In The Next Three Days, we get to see Russell Crowe in a film that actually takes place in today's world. It's a departure from his better known films that take place in the past such as Gladiator, Master and Commander, and Robin Hood. Even his other films have usually taken place over 50 years ago like Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind. So it's nice to finally see him play a person of modern times that we can relate to – and he excels at it.Similar to the film Conviction released last month, which was about a woman who did whatever it took to get her brother released from prison, Crowe plays a man named John Brennan who will stop at nothing to get his wife out of prison. But in this film, he's not out to do it through the legal system. He has lost all faith in that; he decides he's going to break her out of prison himself. Of course, he believes his wife is innocent and doesn't even question her on the matter. He continues to raise their son on his own yet, at the same time, plots out every single detail it would take to pull off such an arduous task. He even seeks out a man who wrote a book detailing the multiple times he managed to escape from prison himself. The man is played by Liam Neeson in somewhat of a one-scene cameo. But that scene lays the groundwork for how John devises his plan and becomes convinced that he is capable of succeeding. He learns that not one detail can be overlooked.John goes from being a schoolteacher to a guy who carries a gun and makes deals in shady neighborhoods to get the tools that he needs. Still, he watches over his son and takes him to the local playground to be the good father that he is while not doing illegal activity. It just shows how good of a man he really is but that he is willing to resort to anything in order to free his wife. The movie becomes a real thriller, one of the best I've seen in a while. It's the kind of film where you find yourself really rooting for the main character and it keeps you on the edge of your seat as well. Though it may seem a little unrealistic to pull off such a scheme in real life, Russell Crowe plays John with enough determination and conscientiousness to make you believe that anything can be done if you try hard enough.",The Next Three Days

There are slow moments, but never really any dull moments because the tension is always there.My wife and I avoid movies that are all about special effects or top heavy with impossible action sequences that no one could possibly survive. (O.K., there are some things that are pretty unlikely, but you will be carried along by the action and it will not distract or detract.) We also have grown tired of movies where the plot starts out in one direction and wanders away to who-knows-where after the first hour. We go to the movies to see people we like do neat things rather than watching a bunch of losers share their suffering with us.

That's stupid. She has a son out there. Did she care about her?She never made an appeal or told her correct side if the story. I found that to be dumb.

Rather than a slavish copy, director and screenwriter, Paul Haggis, expertly takes the premise and creates a totally new slant on the theme.Russell Crowe plays mild mannered English teacher, John Brennan, in this dark, smouldering thriller set in Pittsburgh. Setting out to free his wife, having been wrongly convicted of murder, the tension builds as he finds his way out of middle American life and into the crime underworld to gather knowledge and resources. Crowe is comfortable in the role as the tenacious underdog with an excellent performance. Elizabeth Banks, playing Lara Brennan, is also impressive as his incarcerated wife.The film is complimented by a well written script providing enough tension, action, and drama, to satisfy lovers of the thriller genre.The supporting cast are superb, especially Lennie James as Lieutenant Nabulsit.

I found Million Dollar Baby to be overrated and Crash was cloying and manipulative - one of the worst Best Picture winners in recent history, and an unintended champion of homophobia. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed The Next Three Days. In my opinion, it is was of the most successful thrillers I've seen in the last ten years. I was literally on the edge of my seat during the majority of the movie. The Next Three Days isn't without its flaws - it is a Paul Haggis film, after all. The writing of the police characters is seemingly taken from the worst TV procedural clichés. And while Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks shine in the lead roles, some of the casting in the supporting roles seems off. Like the bizarre Tony Danza cameo in Crash, here we get Daniel Stern as a high- priced lawyer and Liam Neeson as hardened criminal.

He believe hes knows simply because its his wife and he loves her and that there has been a terrible mistake. He also believes that soon the mistake will be admitted through the courts and soon his wife will be cleared and set free from her imprisonment. Unfortunately the opposite happens and he is forced to accept his wife will remain locked away for murder or will he? So strongly does he believe in his wifes innocence and also by witnessing her suicide attempt showing an inability to cope with life behind bars he decides he must take action and sets about hatching a plan to set her free. This involves an almost impossible plan to break his wife out of prison and a tense thrill ride against all odds with twists and turns galore ensues. Climaxed with a pulsating final act this film edge of your seat stuff.What I really liked about this movie was that despite a slow burner first hour you are gripped throughout. Russel Crowe is superb as the lead character and I was really impressed with Elizabeth Banks who plays his wife. Banks shows great emotion throughout especially in a scene where Crowe has to tell her there is no hope of her being cleared for the murder charge. Without saying a word her emotion resonates off the screen as you witness in her effect her lifes end. This is just one example of the many scenes she excels in and I was blown away by her performance. There are many great actors with smallish parts including Brian Dennehy,Daniel Stern and Liam Neeson who has only one scene albeit a significant one even Olivia Wilde pops up.

The rest before that is methodical and sets the basis for how the action sequence works out.Russell Crowe once again pulls a fantastic performance as the protagonist in this film. He reminds me of the real life person he played in A Beautiful Mind, John Nash. This is because of the vulnerability and stress both characters share. In this film, Crowe plays John Brennan, an ordinary loving family guy who risks everything to break his wife free from a life sentence in jail. Because Brennan has limited time to break his wife out of prison, a now or never opportunity, the pressure causes him to make a lot of mistakes throughout the film thus creating tense moments to keep you captivated and doubtful of his chances to succeed. In some ways, it's hard to route for him as a hero as he embarks on a dark path. Ironic for that person when they attempt to free someone whom they believe is innocent.Liam Neeson is the one who prepares him for this. Although he only features in one scene of the film, he is the catalyst for the events that follow but is doubtful himself. Admittedly, I'm a growing fan of Liam Neeson because he plays such bad-ass and flawless characters. Particularly after the renown action film, Taken, in which he is gloriously quoted for his line, ""I will hunt you, I will find you and I will kill you."" to which the bad guy responds, ""Good luck."" Liam Neeson in fact says, ""Good luck"" to Crowe in this film as if to be a sneaky reference, which made me laugh.Elizabeth Banks also shows a remarkable performance as the supporting role, Lara Brennan. It's kinda funny to have watched her in 'Man on a Ledge' trying to talk people out of committing suicide as a cop and then in this where she is a suicidal prisoner being convicted of murder! Out of all the films I've seen her in, this performance is unique compared to her other roles and far more emotionally provocative. It is only at the end of the film when the whole murder scene is replayed properly and it is revealed whether Lara Brennan is the killer or not. Throughout the film, the viewer is made unsure of what to believe. The film follows John's perspective throughout so we aren't shown Lara's hardships in prison but I don't think that would've been necessary after having watched the film.I'm surprised the film is a 12A actually! I feel more inclined to rate this film a 15 since the strict 12 rating seems to have been disregarded now. There are some unpleasant and violent scenes. The authorities are portrayed to be aggressive and there's suicidal themes and minor drug references. I don't know how accurate the escape method is but it seems plausible.In conclusion, this film is excellent! My dad missed the beginning but soon got captivated right to the very end. We were trying to figure it out along the way but the film and the directing is very good at making you assume things and then twists it round, therefore making it hard to predict. For instance, (May spoil) some scenes create tension and then pan out later to reveal solutions, whereas other scenes are continuous implying something is going to happen.Therefore, I give this 9 out of 10. I only tend to give the most classic and personal films a 10 and I thought about giving this an 8 but overall it's brilliant and deserves a 9 and a watch. The only problem with tense films (as I've said with A Beautiful Mind) is the enjoyment won't be the same the 2nd time round because you'll know what's going to happen unless you've forgotten. However, if the directing is skilled and cuts it so close that you can't help but react, then you'll still enjoy it. I have yet to watch it for a 2nd time whenever that may be.",The Next Three Days

But I was all wondering till the end of the movie about the extremely genuine appeal..Now I know its reason. But, It doesn't belittle the importance of Net Three Days even a little ..First of all, It would be better not to disclose anything more than what is mentioned in the synopsis. The whole film is an experience.It reminds us of Fugitive and Taken a bit, but maintains its own identity.Russell Crowe makes us feel he is just one among us..no Jason Statham martial gimmicks nor flawless intelligence.. It isn't a bloody thriller either.It gives more impetus on the familial bonds as well along with the main action. Even though it runs for about 133 minutes, never once do we lose the thrill. Russell Crowe once again proves his credibility with strong backing roles from Elizabeh Banks and Brian Dennehy (Crowe's father in the film).

Everything about this movie is implausible. Everything. I never even figured out whether she was convicted or not! What did she do? How long was her time? It's all a mess and you're left guessing and puzzled. And don't get me started on their kid. Honestly, put a child mannequin in the part and wouldn't know the difference. I think he mumbles 3 lines the whole movie, and shows ZERO emotion to ANYTHING. Then towards the when the cops magically figure everything out, wow!

The problem is, however, that I despise this kind of movie making. I can understand the scenario where you see an movie or read a book which has already been made a movie, and think - I can do this better. Or I see a different angle. Or whatever creative idea it might be. This movie though, is not that. This movie is made by accountants. It's a carbon copy of the movie ""Pour Elle"", only in English. Basically it's the most expensive subtitles in the world.So I strongly recommend that you see the original instead. It's even a little better since the American version forgot one crucial scene and added a scene that has no reason to be there except for looking good in the trailer.Once again - see the original (Por Elle).

243,recoltes,masterclass of reluctant violence,8,22 January 2011,"A tense and understated performance by Russell Crowe as the husband of a convicted murderer. Crowe gives a masterclass of reluctant violence - required in breaking out his wife - and underpins his performance with many tender moments with his son. The slow moving beginning perfectly mirrors the speed of the legal system, with the pace of the finale matching that of a breakout. As a thriller this one puts you firmly in the shoes of the protagonist and, while this might not be pretty or enjoyable, it offers the escapism delivered by good movies. There may be no Oscars for this movie; the wife's suicide attempts are disappointing when other methods could have been used to convey her distress. A good mother does not leave a child behind nor does she throw herself from a moving vehicle in protest. This is a one man show by Crowe with a short cameo by quality actor; Liam Neeson. Crowe is always thinking, never cowboy, and this performance is one of his best. The direction facilitates this and when you are concentrating on the actor, the direction is fulfilling its role in covering and not driving the story.",The Next Three Days

When I saw the trailer I thought that it's gonna be amazing, something like Prison Break. Interesting, entertaining and so on. But it wasn't! This film is absolutely awful. Totally boring, never happen unexpected things, I always knew what is gonna happen. The actors were very bad too. It is ridiculous when the woman always tries to kill herself, she never do anything to get out from the jail, she's just waiting for he miracle... And of course (like in almost every American movie) the afro American policeman suddenly figures out the plan of the husband and he goes immediately to the hospital. And how can a simple teacher kill all the bad guys and drug dealers? I can just laugh watching this. It is impossible. I could tell in 5 minutes all the story of the movie.

245,nithinmmukundan,"Flawed in many ways, but worth a watch...!",5,18 April 2014,"As soon as the first flashback of the murder was shown, I couldn't stop wondering about how the blood got on the back of her coat alone. There were only circumstantial evidence but very few to actually convict her. But I guess the director did a good job by showing only glimpses of the actual ""trial"" that for a little while I thought she actually did it.Now for the next half, it followed a typical Hollywood line where a smartass professor outsmarts the entire police department with very little resources. Even though this was far away from reality and highly improbable, I kind of enjoyed it. Seems breaking out of prisons in US is too easy.What was actually disappointing was the ending when the actual murder clips were shown. Now since this clip was supposed to be what really happened, I felt there was no way of Lara being convicted in any court. The evidence showed against Lara were all flawed and it would've entirely fit her description of the events. Now the court would be left with 2 possible events and one of them doesn't fit in properly, the wrong one. Even if we analyze the evidence without the button pop it wouldn't be enough to convict her. The evidence as produced:1. Fingerprints: Any decent fingerprint experts would've been able to identify if she actually held it in the way the blow was delivered considering the fact the the fire extinguisher was kept completely intact.2. Fire extinguisher: Seriously who in their right minds would leave the fire extinguisher erect nearby after doing such an act ? Even if all she meant was to just hurt her, she would panic on the sight of the blood. And why wasn't there any blood on the fire extinguisher? If there was, why didn't Lara notice it?3. The purse: It was identified that the purse was missing, so was Lara smart enough to take the purse and throw it away yet forget about the fire extinguisher ?4. Blood: How the hell did the blood get on her back alone. There would be obvious blood splatter all over the coat and cars. If the injury was internal why is there any blood in the first place. She was half way through washing the coat so there is no way the labs could have missed it if it was there.5. Motive: The motive was so naive. Who in the world doesn't hate their boss ? Now Lara might have had anger issues(not sure) but such rage would be in the moment and she would've already calmed down by the time she reached the parking lot. The spat wasn't even a personal one.6. Dead body: The position of the dead body coupled with blood splatter analysis would've meant she hit from the right side as opposed to what is shown in the initial clippings. She arrived after the boss so she would've had to sneak all the way around the cars to deliver such a blow for which she would've had to arrive before the boss.7. Coworker : Didn't actually see any of the events. There are at least 6 flaws in the initial story as opposed to a perfectly possible story from Lara's POV. I am pretty sure these kind of cases or arguments often comes up in every court. There were a few circumstantial evidence against Lara but none that where solid. The least any sane court would do is to order a re-investigation or give the benefit of doubt to Lara. All of these observations after not even considering the button incident, the dinner after the murder and timings.Having said all this, the movie is watchable for its thrills and entertainment until you start thinking too deeply.",The Next Three Days
246,grimandpie,Excellent movie!!,8,27 February 2011,"***This review may contain spoilers*** This would have to be the best movie I have seen in some time; storyline, direction and cast are all high quality. It is a difficult one to categorize; the underlying theme is that of a true love story but it is certainly no romance. The movie also contains elements of intrigue, mystery, and nail biting suspense.Russell Crowe's performance is excellent; he transforms the somewhat unrealistic character shift, from mild mannered teacher to desperate husband and prospective savior, into a wholly believable scenario.Elizabeth Banks is also excellent as the selfless wife and mother.How far would you go to 'rescue' and be re-united with the one you love? One of the best features of this movie is the way in which the 'who dunnit' element is handled. Viewers are kept guessing right until the very end and that adds enormously to the overall intrigue.Highly entertaining and highly recommended!!",The Next Three Days

The film is about John, played by a very sharp Russel Crowe, plotting to break his wife out of prison. This is a pretty vague synopsis, and I will leave it there.The movie is very thoughtful; most of the movie is about John preparing for the prison break and to me it all seemed believable. However, while all this preparing and such was pretty cool, the biggest weakness of the movie was it focused to much on the plotting and not enough on the actual event. The preparation for the prison break is more than half of the movie. I think I would have liked it a little more if they have balanced the plotting and the actual break.But once the Next Three Days reaches its main event, you won't be able to stop watching. It's thrilling, intense, emotional, and fun.The Next Three Days is a good prison break movie; anybody interested in this topic will probably like it.",The Next Three Days

The very first scenes and Crowe is in full blown belligerent over confidence mode, it just doesn't work in a film requiring this level of subtlety.His extremely casual relaxed approach in the few hours after his wife is arrested for murder look really poor, totally unbelievable. Is looking that relaxed on your wifes first night in custody bad acting, total lack of empathy for the character or just some form of psychosis? In terms of screenplay it is an almost identical carbon copy of the original French movie ""Anything for Her"" - but with no visible reference to the fact is a copy, but that is where the similarity ends.

Very annoying part of the movie played by Elizabeth Banks. If she wanted to commit suicide again she should do it without involving her husband after all his efforts to save her. My rating of the movie drops from top rating to rather low after seeing this part of the movie!

252,justjerel,rather boring thriller,6,13 February 2011,"This movie is two-thirds drama and one-third thriller, as it takes most of the movie to build-up to the fast-paced conclusion. Russell Crowe does a credible job as an obsessed husband who methodically plots to spring his wife from prison after she is convicted of murdering a co-worker in a fit of anger. The guilt or innocence of his wife, played by a miscast Elizabeth Banks is left hanging until the very end, which makes for some anticipatory enjoyment. The plot is highly incredulous to begin with, but if handled more cleverly it could have been sold, but Crowe doesn't sell it very well. The action scenes when the film finally hits high gear are exciting and well-done, but unfortunately for me do not make up for the boring and protracted prelude to get there.",The Next Three Days
253,julio-m-henriquez,Paul Haggis keeps us in suspense most of the time and manages very well to thrill us in the process.,7,29 June 2011,"The Next Three Days works very well as a drama. The romance in it is somehow moving. Even though it was not as enthralling as I would expect from Paul Haggis it was interesting to watch John Brennan (Russell Crowe) go desperate through the plot and inspiring that he never lost hope. I must say it did not turn out to be very convincing but I bought it. I'm sorry, I happen to believe on resilience.John Brennan lives a happy life with his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and child. One morning the police calls their door and arrest Lara accusing her of the murder of her boss, with whom she argued the previous day. This certainly turns John's life upside down. Who will past the next couple of years rising his little boy, teaching at a community college and trying by all means available to proof Lara's innocence, but the evidence is compelling. She is not coming out.Seeing his family come apart, he becomes desperate and envisions an ambitious plan to break Lara out of prison. To do this he seeks advice from Damon Pennington (Liam Neeson), an ex-convict that successfully escaped prison seven times.Considering he has no experience on criminal activity is funny to see John trying to get IDs and passports from drug dealers; or buying a gun and saying ""show me where the bullets go"". Could this man be up to the task?Paul Haggis keeps us in suspense most of the time and manages very well to thrill us in the process. The acting, as expected, is very good. Russell Crowe naturally fits comfortably in this kind of role and dominates. Equally does Elizabeth Banks. We get Olivia Wilde as the most beautiful single mother you could possibly find taking your kid to the park. She doesn't have much to add to the plot, she just looks good on it, very good. There is also a little conversation with Moran Atias at the beginning of the film I enjoyed a lot.In conclusion this is a film I'd recommend. Is a very nice work from Paul Haggis. I certainty don't think the events depicted on the plot are possible. I just want to believe they are. The story is very romantic and I'm a romantic person myself. I guess that's why I liked it.",The Next Three Days

While many people might this it is just another prison break movie believe you me that is not the case.This film is example of what one will do or how far they will go for love and it is this emotion that R.Crowe and E.Banks bring to the fore.

Olivia Wilde and Liam Neeson also play strong parts.

Come on Pittsburgh police, a person who just hit her boss with a fire extinguisher (and a person who just argued with said boss 30 minutes ago with many witnesses) would not leave the fire extinguisher right next to their own parking space, and drive off so normal out of the garage. Come one, a person who was going to kill their boss would not do it at the office garage at 5 pm when several people are coming and going.

270,Rebel_ku,Makes you think every time you say you love someone how much you really mean it.,8,2 April 2011,"Well I have to say it's been quite some time since I have enjoyed a movie this much. The cast was spot on. Crowe delivers yet again and Elizabeth Banks is also very good. The first half of the movie sort of gives this drama vibe which then rapidly changes in the last 30 minutes which are quite intense. The plot is also very good. The simple fact that somebody who is not at all familiar with crime and the way that prisons and the police operate is ready to do all of the things he did for the person he loves is amazing to say the least. The thing that is hard to believe and is somewhat a flaw is the fact that a community college English literature professor is able to pull this off. Personally I thought that Neeson's character would be more involved in the whole ordeal, a thing that would have made the feat that Crowe's character takes more believable. But despite that I'd say that this movie is a MUST for everyone that likes a good drama/romance with a little tension.",The Next Three Days
271,corinavalentina26,An intense love story,8,20 September 2019,"In a ""Crash"" movie style, where pieces come together like in a puzzle throughout the movie, geniously directed and supported by a wittily written screenplay, the movie left me with serious questions like ""was it inspired by true events?"", that good and credible the movie is.As extraordinary circumstances demand planning and implementation of extraordinary actions, in accordance with what is it at stake - everything - and the risk threshold of the hero - and boy he risks everything - this is what makes this movie an emotional rollercoaster, which does not give you even one chance to be bored as you can never know what happens next or how is going to end. You just sit quietly and enjoy every second to the maximum.The performance of Russell Crowe is monumental as he succeds to enrich his complex character with great profoundness without expressing too many words, and I guess that this is the chief reason why he has been casted.
It is fascinating to follow metamorphosis of the leading role as this hooks you incredibly in, especially due to the fact that the movie is very well structured, presenting their beautiful life before - with smart, funny dialogue between him and his wife and their happy couple life & after - with all the despair, family drama and his unusual perseverance and love for his family.It struck me deeply as one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen.",The Next Three Days

273,jorgecampoverde1,Astounding thriller,10,25 February 2011,"I have been lurking this site for years, reading reviews and checking movie ratings, and never felt compelled to write a review about a movie. Well, this movie moved me so bad, that I just registered with the solely purpose of writing a ""review"" on The Next Three Days. I know absolutely nothing about the technical aspects in a movie, I ignore everything about direction, acting, editing, photography and every knowledge involved in film making. So I can only write this review from my limbic system, not from my cerebral cortex! First of all, Russell Crowe. From my naive perspective, I think he is absolutely brilliant in this movie. Every one of his moves felt authentic, John Brennan is a compact and clear, flawless character. Second, the movie itself was an absolute thrill. It starts somewhat slow, but steadily gains momentum, and eventually hits the viewer (at least me!) with an impressive emotional force. Third, Liam Neeson's cameo (is this the right word?) was a nice surprise. You would think that I like to indulge in movie praising, but I have actually been saving these ten stars for many years, and I never thought a thriller was going to get them, as it is not my favorite genre !",The Next Three Days
274,kabailey61,"A good movie, worth the three hours.",7,23 March 2018,This movie is worth watching despite some weak plot points. The characters are likable and I found myself rooting for John Brennen throughout the movie. The only thing I didn't like was how the police shoved their way into the Brennen home and arrested Lara. This was very upsetting to Luke and to me as well. Even murder suspects and their families deserve to be treated with respect. I would hope that this is not how real police officers treat suspects.,The Next Three Days

And If I had known that Paul Haggis wrote and directed it, I never would have watched it. The only likable and talented person in the mix is Russell Crowe and I feel bad that he got stuck in this unbelievable mess!!You could tell that Haggis thought he was making a ""smart"" edgy thriller but in the end it was contrived and ""dumbed-down"" with too many convenient accidents and coincidences that made me frustrated and angry with the film. It had the potential and seemed like it was trying to be like ""The Fugitive"" or films like that where we are to suspend our disbelief but this was too far over the edge to believe any of it.......especially the part at the end with the medical test and her transport to the hospital........really?? really??

Saw it yesterday, but still thinking about it. I'm a Christian and I think that Christians must watch this movie all around the world to understand what love can do to person.

277,fergo-2,"a flat, one note trip to a jailbreak",4,9 December 2010,"The Next Three Days If you decide to see The Next Three Days, be warned that the title is a gentle hint that three days long is just what this movie feels like. It opens with a bang and then descends into a prolonged lethargy that erupts in a final period of blazing action. I must add that even in the closing chaos, Russell Crowe manages to confine things to a slow crawl. And believe me, the movie is his to make or break since he's on screen for most of the two hour plus running time.As Crowe moves through a very weak script in one flat note, he never invites us in. He plays John, a husband who adores his wife Lara (Elizabeth Banks) and son Luke. Their perfect life is destroyed in an instant when police roar into their house to arrest Lara for murder. Circumstantial evidence brings her a twenty year prison sentence. She had passed by the murder scene in a parking garage; her coat bore a spot of the victim's blood; her fingerprints were on the weapon. Ninety interminable minutes pass before this bad news is explained.During the next three years, John dedicates himself to proving his wife's innocence. When the final legal appeal is denied, he knows the only solution is a jail break. It's here that both the script and Mr. Crowe let us down. Though determined, John never develops a plan that is either credible or cohesive. Exploring one idea here, another there, he learns from the internet how to make a ""bump key"" that will open any lock, but never gives us the feeling that he might succeed in springing poor Lara. This guy doesn't seem up to the job. He is, after all, a school teacher, not a crook.It's hard to root for a guy who stays stuck in the dead center of his own despair. As much as we try to push it away, a wave of disapproval washes over us: ""Aw, come on, Russell; you can do better than that."" For most of this long period, he simply broods. This is all preparation for a jailbreak that most probably will fail. The planner is neither precise nor clever. Liam Neeson, a baseball cap hiding his celebrity, is terrific as a break-in mentor to John as he warns him ""You want this too much; you'll screw it up."" Elizabeth Banks is wonderful as an angry woman in the first strong scene where she inadvertently establishes a motive for the upcoming murder. She manages to convey the only real emotion in the script whenever we see her, but once she's in jail, Crowe turns the picture to dull color. Am I asking for The Gladiator? Not really; I like John, the community college teacher with conscience (a Prius). But given the violence director Paul Haggis pours on his characters, we all could have used just a touch of color from Bonnie and Clyde.",The Next Three Days
278,shirleykernan-1,"Unconvincing, prison break mush",3,16 January 2011,"Focussing on the actions of a man driven to extremes when his wife is imprisoned for a crime she claims not to have committed, The Next Three Days sets itself up as an exciting countdown movie but fails to deliver the necessary punch.Russell Crowe plays John Brennan who, when faced with no other choice, decides to break his beloved missus Lara (Elizabeth Banks) out of jail – an ordinary man undertaking an extraordinary task. And that's the crux of the problem, real life is generally yawnsome; it's hard to show ordinary while maintaining tension.When it is striving to be real, The Next Three Days is dull and easily forgotten; when realism is damned and Brennan/Crowe has some successes, it all seems rather ridiculous and pointless – are we really supposed to be rooting for this idiot and his idiot plan? And what evidence has this conviction been based on anyway? The ping of a missing button apparently - which says a lot about the trembling basis on which this tale unfolds.The Next Three Days is at its best when it ramps up the action – when Brennan/Crowe finds himself in the middle of a drugs den and takes appropriately, if surprisingly harsh action considering he is a man made of marshmallow. It's not that the plot becomes anymore plausible, but at least you have some well paced action and a few interesting characters to soak up the general malaise.Another good point was that, unlike Brennan/Crowe's unwavering belief, the audience does start to doubt the innocence of the missus . We haven't, after all, seen anything to prove Mrs Brennan really didn't do it. When Lara, in a fit a of pique, admits to the crime, I almost cheered aloud that little Ms Perfect might actually be a cold hearted murderer after all - now there's a character flaw worth my attention...for a few minutes anyway, till we are back to Professor Plod and his plodding plan. The Next Three Days sets itself up as the story of how a mundane everyman can achieve the impossible when driven by love and belief – an insight into the mind of a desperate man, if you will. It is an interesting idea but, while Brennan faces the odd hitch, everything seems to slot into place too neatly and the action – when it does arrive – seems to belong to a different movie.It's not a bad film (based on the fact I have seen The Ugly Truth and therefore have seen worse), but it's not quite a good film either; it's just more Sunday afternoon on the couch than Saturday night in the cinema.",The Next Three Days

The characters were not particularly believable, especially Russel Crowe, who had a pretty sub par performance compared to some of the great movies he's previously starred in. There were additionally a handful of minor holes in the plot that just left it feeling poorly thought out and executed.

It's slow at first, some people might not like it but you really get attached to Russell Crowe's character, his problems, and his ambition to get his wife out of prison. I have to admit, I'm not a fan of happy endings but throughout the whole movie just want him to succeed. Of course, the cops just makes it impossible for him so his creativity to go through different situation is just jaw dropping. The music selection in the background was also pretty sweet, but my favorite scene in the movie was when his wife try to commit suicide in the end by trying to jump out of the car and Russell stops her. That was AWESOME. Only thing that I did not like but I can't complain that much was when one of the detectives had a suspicion that the wife was innocent and try to find a piece of evidence but it just barely missed his eyes and he didn't see it but other than that it was sweet.",The Next Three Days

295,SparrowSaltskin,What people dislike is actually the best of it,10,23 February 2011,"This might be one of the best films I've ever seen (and I've seen millions). It's not a thriller, not a chick flick, not a drama, it's just a damn good story with two really brilliant actors. And til the very last moment you don't know how it's gonna end. (At least I didn't; maybe some of the other reviewers are so bored that they couldn't wait how the story's gonna go - so they presumed the end; I didn't. I thought it was as suspenseful as ""The Rear Mirror"" or the ""Fugitive"".) The same with the action. Remember ""Jaws"" - when you don't see the shark for about an hour (and the real action happens only in the last 15 minutes)? Nobody thinks JAWS was a bad movie (because it didn't start like TRANSFORMERS) - and so is this film. It tells his story, very sad (maybe too sad for some of the viewers), depressingly realistic, in fact (if you like that - I do), and just when you don't expect it anymore - it gets really intense. But better than the action is the credibility; Elizabeth Banks (who I only know from her hilarious role in ""30 Rock"") plays the convict wive without frills or attitude or make up - while Russell Crowe is the loving husband, who gets more and more despaired, ""hopeless without his wife"" (that's what he said). He's no James Bond, no gladiator, just an average guy who wants his life back. Probably the best role he's ever played (since ""L.A. Confidential""). There is one scene in the middle you will never forget (no spoiler alert here) - and which I've never seen in all the million films I've watched. (Not in a thriller, in an ""escape movie"" or even in a love drama). Worth alone the ticket. But, as I said, this is no ordinary movie.",The Next Three Days

297,goalieump413,Unusual suspense,7,13 October 2012,"While not the typical route to an end, ""Three Days"" was better than expected. At first, we're introduced to characters within easy grasp. Everyday people working, struggling, laughing there way in and out of each day, when, of course, a sudden horrific turn of events forces the expected audience response. Care for the victims, sympathize with the wrongly accused, ride along for the resolution. While most crime/prison/justice suspense dramas bring you down to the level of the wrongfully accused, blah-blah, ""Three Days"" manages to dodge the chin music hurled at the protagonists without discoloring them beyond repair. Whether private citizens, cops, family members, bystanders, and corrections officials are the ones currently on screen, there's no real ""bad guy"" here. No real disdain for anyone working against the interest of ultimate justice. Even the drug dealers seem humanly caught up in the mess.There are substantial clues, here and there, but it's not a ""blink-and- you'll-miss-it!"" experience. The film's pace flows naturally, letting you mind process, absorb, and reject the unnecessary stuff. There are nice tangent touches, nervous clicks that amount to nothing. But as the pace of the story quickens, those elements are reduced.Odd that the soundtrack has a romantic/punk/dreampop feel. I guess this relates to John Brennan's (Crowe) current state of delusional mind. It's a soup of sounds loosely bound by story, so in a way, the film is the music's videotrack.Regardless of the story's fairly narrow scope, it's an enjoyable film, worthy of a good discussion with your significant other over a cup of joe. Taking into account that director Paul Haggis might have aimed higher than that, you might just sit through it again for posterity.7 out of 10 for me. What about you?",The Next Three Days

Your heart just would start beating fast in anticipation after that.Some people have a preconceived notion that an action movie must be starred by a young, handsome man in his late 20s, and that the movie should involve car chases, gun fighting, stunts, and may be some explicit sexual content. This movie throws egg in their faces, because the ""hero"" is a middle aged man, who is married, has a kid, and is well settled. But in this case, in spite of being a family movie, the director has somehow managed to make it flow on quick like an action movie. I don't want to spoil it by going into the details of where exactly the ""action"" comes from.This movie also clearly shows to what extent would a man go, and what sort of risks would he be willing to take when the peaceful living of his family is endangered.

You either identify with this or you don't. I actually know at least two people who didn't and hence did not get a full appreciation of the film. I thought the Liam Neeson Character was so interesting for his short amount of screen time, that you could make a whole other movie about that guy.

Typically I find complaints in movies. This was one of the few I have seen where I have none. I was blown away. Russell Crowe's acting job was superior. It was very involved. The movie gets you hooked and it is impossible to get impatient or bored during this film. I would definitely recommend seeking this movie out. After watching I immediately rated it and purchased it online. It is that impressive of a film. I write no spoilers because this is definitely not a movie you would want to ""spoil"".

I won't say anything, just watch and you'll know it.I just have one thing in my mind that really bugging me about the end of the movie. I think the creator ShoulD LeT the detective find the MissinG ButtoN, it feels the 'good guys' in this movie still like losing, because they still thinking the wife guilty.If the detective found the missing button, it will give the police an indication that the wife telling the truth, it's okay even the movie ends there, at least the audiences have hope, that they might be able to come back to United States someday..just my 2 cents, hope this helpful..cheers.. movieFan",The Next Three Days
307,stevewilkinson0910,Superb thriller. Better than the French version!,10,22 June 2018,"An outstanding thriller with solid cast performances throughout. The Pittsburgh setting is a breath of fresh air and the tempo of the movie is its great strength. Moments of touching emotion tempered with fast paced action sequences. The story of an ordinary person put into a vulnerable and dangerous setting is always fascinating. You find yourself thinking, ""what would I do in that situation?"" There are very few plot holes, if any. No ridiculous special effects or unrealistic fight sequences that plague so many movies in the genre. 
I decided to buy the French version ""Pour Elle"" to make my own comparison of the two films. The reviews here that praise it unequivocally and heavily criticise the Russell Crowe version are way off base. the French version is mediocre at best. It lacks realism, the acting is wooden and setting is vague. The police and prison officers are not as intimidating, the parents of the lead actor are weak and the chemistry between the husband and wife is unconvincing. Just because it has subtitles does not make it any better!",The Next Three Days

Keeps you engaged the whole time. Suspenseful. Good acting. Good plot. Believable. Didn't seem like your high end movie, but you know what, that's OK. I actually know of someone that has been wrongly accused of murder, so I can only imagine what the main character was going through. Elizabeth Banks did a really good job of portraying that character. She was very believable. Would have liked a little more character development in the beginning, but otherwise, no big complaints.

In this movie, he does his job with the usual competence, but a weak script and casting mistakes almost make the movie sink. On the script, it's hard to believe a mere teacher will be able to (SPOILER) kill drug dealers as if he was Jack Bauer, but OK, he is desperate to save his wife, we've seen this situation countless times before. For me, however, casting Elizabeth Banks as the wife is the biggest mistake of the movie. She's not convincing and she and Crowe lack chemistry. They are not convincing as a couple and it's impossible to look at her and figure out why Crowe's character would do all that he does. The couple would have to be madly in love, but they look like brothers or cousins. The ending was, for me, also a flop. (SPOILER) During the movie there remains a doubt if the wife killed her boss or not. The cliché ending was unsatisfactory. It would be much much better if, in the end, it was revealed she was really the killer. THAT would be a surprise in a movie that tries to be ""The Fugitive - version 2010"", but gets way behind this goal.",The Next Three Days

I don't want to give away anything about the movie but I love the type of movies that make use of every single scene (to ultimately piece together the movie). Watch the movie and watch it carefully. Everything makes sense and I dare say it was brilliant. I'm a sucker for these types of movies (thrillers) but I just think this movie was really good all-around.Find out for yourself and watch it if you enjoy these types of movies.

This film is called The Next Three Days, so from the start of the movie, and during the movie (thanks to the countdown reminder) we, as the audience automatically assume that he will successfully break his wife out of prison. This is a fun movie to watch, and usually I don't really care too much about a films demerits, because most films are pretty bad by anyones standard. The whole tension string of the film was based upon whether or not he would get his wife out of prison? Seriously? Of course he does! We know this when we take our seats.

Elizabeth Banks is so beautiful and able to capture the various ""comes across as"" portrayals of her character from organized to bitch to beautiful Russel Crowe plays his part perfectly too, as a loving husband who won't give up and won't let go, despite the presence of a seemingly interested beautiful woman once his wife is locked up.The fact that there's a child involved as well as financial difficulty really highlight the question: How far would you go if you believe your wife & best friend to be innocent of murder? Thank you writers, director, producers, crew and (so much more than) actors, for bringing us, as mentioned in another review, not the typical Hollywood movie.This movie is so grounded in reality, you feel the sense of impending doom or negativity.

Some scenes were dragged with added sequences and some were curtailed. So cannot say that it was inspired by, if you are able to see, then you would know it was quite a close copy from the french thriller ""Pour Elle"" (1008), with only the fact that Diane Kruger was looking better than Elizabeth Banks. but again that's a matter of personal choice.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1217637/ (Pour Elle).Enjoyable thriller for the first time viewers.

329,yellow_freak_of_nature,Yawn,4,12 January 2011,"Promising as it may seem this film is not for those who like enthralling films. Chase scenes are mediocre with suspense rated as tepid. The plot has many 'twists and turns' although none of them are shocking or in fact anything other than annoying. Whilst things were undoubtedly happening, the storyline felt stagnant with no arcs or character developments. The overt music rarely relates to the content of the shot or the emotion it is meant to encapsulate. In short I simply did not care if she was guilty or not or if they got away. If anything I was hoping they wouldn't so something notable would happen.Paul Haggis has taken at best a one hour and twenty film and turned it into a two hour film which feels like four. However if you like seeing shifty people failing to look anything but shifty, police pathetically doing jigsaws, Russell Crowe's face burned into you retinas and how to and how not to pick a variety of locks then this film is for you.

After all legal resources dry up, what would you do? Would you let her waste away in prison, or would you risk everything - your kid, your family, your freedom - to set her free? In The Next Three Days, writer/director Paul Haggis (Crash) explores these questions and delivers a surprisingly effective thriller. Read FilmJabber's full The Next Three Days movie review.This movie hit all the right spots: Intensity, Thrills, Action, Romance.Lets start with the Cons first. The Cons:This movie is very predictable and too some could be seen as a traditional ""feel good movie"". As well as this it is a bit unrealistic, and you don't really have any belief in the movie being real. ""John Brennan"" played by Russell Crowe, starts out as an English secondary school teacher with a hot wife. By the end of the movie he is now, ""John Brennan"" the bullet spraying, Jack Bouer, Prison breaking, hardcore genius. Unrealistic? I dunno, your English teacher could be defeating the legal system by night.Something that particularly got on my nerves is the lack of dialogue through out the movie. A lot of questions are left unanswered because of the shortage in conversation. John is on his own for most of the movie, and 70% of the scenes just show him. You can tell that Haggis, has introduced characters - just so we can get some flipping talking. Of course one of these irrelevant characters is yummy mummy ""Moran Atias"" who seems some what interested in Russell Crowe, but as i say she has no importance to the movie except eye candy. But whats wrong with that? The first part of the movie is a bit slow to get good, but when it gets good, IT gets good.The Pros: Russell Crowe is brilliant, his acting just does get better and better. The interaction between him and the young boy playing his son, is inspiring. Three year old Toby Green plays a subtle but important role through the movie. He has little amount of lines, and doesn't need to do a lot. However it is persistent throughout the movie how much John and Lara do love their child. There are several scenes in which completely capture the audience. Very powerful scenes of John's desperation, Giving you hair raising and ""wow"" moments almost every ten second at the end of the movie.For those of you who love Prison Break, this is one of those movies that you will not be disappointed with. The prison break in the second half is spectacular, John's plan is revealed only at the end when everything falls into place. Throughout most ""feel good"" movies you know the outcome, but this isn't the case with The Next Three Days. Of course you have some idea that the Prison Break will be successful, but right up to the end you do ask yourself questions - can they actually do it. The pictures and ideas, at the end of the movie are insane, car chases, train journeys, zoo's, hospital wings, change of clothes, gun shootings, barbed wire, attempted suicides and sunglasses.An English teacher with such a genius plan - executed to perfection. Every coincidence going his way. No its not entirely believable. But it leaves you thinking, could a simple guy with passion like me or you, defeat the government and break someone you love out of prison. Its been done before. How much would it take for you to get to that point, If you know for a fact your loved one didn't commit the crime. Watching the movie with my girlfriend, we exchanged questions after. ""Would you do that for me?"" in the back of your mind - you always think maybe just maybe.This movie gets a deserved 8/10 from me. The Pros outweigh the Cons tremendously, and i'd advice you to go spend your money on this movie as it is an all round good movie - take a date, they'll love it.",The Next Three Days

I expected a conspiracy type film like the above mentioned but this is much more believable and the drama is heart-rending. I am still surprised by how little exposure this movie got.

342,tech-renee19,An astonishingly entertaining story,10,24 April 2011,"I knew 5 minutes into the movie that trying to do math while watching would be pointless, I was already too drawn in. As The Next Three Days played, it was clear that this movie was something special, and although the trailer and advertisements may depict The Next Three Days as just another thriller, in its entirety, it is much more than a thriller, but a dramatic love story that captures the emotions of the audience, has genuine performances, and tells a story worth hearing.In the movie, starring Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks, we are introduced to young married couple, with a young son. The Brennan's appear to be an average family, when out of the blue, wife Lara is arrested for the murder of her female boss. Her finger prints were found on the murder weapon, Lara was seen leaving the scene, and in addition, Lara and her boss had a public, heated argument the day she was murdered, giving her motive. Three years after her guilty conviction, husband John Brennan has expended all his efforts to have a jury find her innocent, and life becomes even more gloomy as he realizes his wife will never get to live a normal life with her husband and son. After Lara attempts to take her own life, John decides that life in prison will not be the life for his wife, and he turns his life upside down to prepare to break his wife out of prison.The build up this causes in the movie brings thrills to audience members that is only enhanced by the created emotional connections to the characters. We see John Brennan dive into an unknown world to him as he is forced to associate with drug dealers, illegal paper producers, and hustlers to get the materials he needs to break his wife out of prison. As a viewer, it is easy to feel for John Brennan, we see him as a single father, a husband who loves his wife deeply, and a man that will do anything to keep his family together. As radical of an idea it is, breaking his wife out of prison caused him to become another person, yet his love for his wife and son never change.The Next Three Days, provides something that other thrillers do not: a love connection that adds to the emotional connection of the audience, not to mention an extreme adrenaline rush as we view John Brennan prepare for the breakout. This thrilling movie will captivate you, provoke your feelings and thoughts towards your loved ones, and is pure entertainment from beginning to end. With a star cast and the story line to back it up, something uniquely created is portrayed. This memorable, well performed film, The Next Three Days, forces us to ask ourselves, how far would we go for the ones we love. So, how far would you go to save someone you love from a life of misery?",The Next Three Days

I haven't seen the European version of this film but I bet that it was much better if it warranted a ""re-run."" I was horrified seeing the many positive reviews on this and other sites and the strangest thing was that many prominent film critics gave this piece quite high ratings (b/c of Haggis?). I was relieved when I found the reviews by the LA Times, Rolling Stones and Village Weekly. Haggis should not make a movie for the next 300 years. I'm also intrigued by Crowe. I think he is a great actor but I wonder if his handlers even read scripts before they set him up with a new project.",The Next Three Days
344,bob-winegar-48-871930,Next Three Days,7,8 May 2011,"Tight, nerve wracking plot with a couple of exceptions:The escape scene where the wife tries to throw herself out her car door upon finding out their son would be left behind is Bollywood at it's worst. Doing a 360 degree spin at 70 mph in front of an 18 wheeler, then both vehicles ending up facing the right way, with a cheery wave by the truck driver is preposterous. He more likely would have walked back and punched Crowe's lights out. Passing thru the border with the old couple would have been a lost cause, as border crossings have both facial and license plate recognition photo software.It took a pile of luck to get this family to Venezuala, where they'd probably be kidnapped and brought back to so-called American justice anyway!",The Next Three Days
345,manager-55-468343,Awesome!,10,16 May 2011,"I loved this movie. It was intense and had a great story line. You can't take your eyes off the screen because you have no idea what is going to happen next. The movie flows from scene to scene and you can follow what is going on. It is a movie that you want to watch again after you finish. There are so many little details that you can catch the second time. There were so many intense parts that i loved! You will love this movie. It almost reminded me of a Jason Bourne Movie, a little bit. I really liked Russell Crowe's dad in the movie. He only plays a small role, but he is so sweet.I would recommend this movie!",The Next Three Days
346,ghall69,Best Film of (2010),10,6 June 2011,"Russell Crowe was at his brilliant best. This tense thriller has everything,from a good story to the edge of your seat suspense! Nice little cameo part with Liam Neeson added to the thrills. Credit should also go to Elizabeth Banks who plays Crowe's not guilty/guilty wife as she certainly gives a brilliant performance of the accused wife and mother facing the slammer.But it's the get away plan the Crowe's Chaacter hatches that although in the real world improbable,for a movie makes perfect entertainment. If you're a fan of Crowe or just love damn good movies The Next Three Days is a brilliantly gripping,thrilling and tense movie that only being a 12 certificate the whole family can watch.I think the critics missed this one when it first came out on release? Best film of (2010)",The Next Three Days
347,mugaburu198013,Getting fed up with remakes,7,12 July 2011,"I must say that I've got nothing against the film itself. I'd say is alright with good acting. It just happens that yesterday I watched the original being a 2008 release against this 2010 remake and I'm beginning to be fed up with these kind of quick remakes. Sure I prefer the French option for many reasons: - The plot it's more veracious's. - The acting is a bit better. - I don't like these commercials quick remakes just to offer more familiar faces to the U.S. market. (F.ex. Millennium trilogy) - American industry is very strong; that means that their storytelling techniques, the camera works, the actors/actresses and very obviously the sets (cities and landviews) are all the time on screen causing me tiredness. Applied to these remakes even more remarkedly. I enjoyed very much the different sets, land-views, mood of the people, even light of the original Millennium and in this case the streets of Lille? in France. It is refreshing. I must say to know my context that I'm Spanish and try to watch not only American films. Enjoy...",The Next Three Days
348,ali_g305,"A thrilling, emotional story of love.",8,14 May 2012,"The Next Three Days is a slow building thriller about college teacher Russell Crowe planning out an escape plan to break his wife out of prison after she was arrested for a murder Crowe believes she has been wrongfully accused for.At first viewing, i thought the film was satisfactory but i watched it again recently and on second viewing, i enjoyed it more. That usually happens, i enjoy movies when i watch it a second time.Russell Crowe, my favourite actor, does a commendable job. Not his best performance but at least he keeps you locked into the film to see what he does. Elizabeth Banks plays distressed and emotional wreck very well in her character.Liam Neeson's cameo performance is a great highlight, which he shares a scene with Russell Crowe.The final 40 minutes is what makes this film enjoyable. It is a thrilling, riveting, fast paced chase at the end, which I really enjoyed. One of the best on-foot chase scenes.More thrilling and more emotional than you think, The Next Three Days features good performances, a tense story with a riveting conclusion, this is one film any Russell Crowe fan needs to see.",The Next Three Days
349,slimwhit33,Great Suspense Thriller!,9,27 February 2012,"Absolutely loved this movie. Found myself tensed up and a tad sweaty by the end of it. I would highly recommend giving it a chance.Read some of the other user reviews here after watching, and saw a lot of people mention that its a remake of a French film. Not sure why that has to be a drawback or a negative, and certainly doesn't detract from my feelings after watching it.Crowe was very convincing in the role. He passed off the everyday man with a moral dilemma extremely well. I found myself talking to him in my head at several different points in the movie.I couldn't give it a 10, because there are some minor holes in the story and wasn't sold on the pain the wife was feeling as much as I felt I should have been.",The Next Three Days
350,jithujosekokken,Perfect plot for family movie,9,30 May 2021,The best thing about this movie is that there are no loop holes left and all the questions are answered. It's really a thriller with lot of family love and emotion involved. Any man who would love his wife would love this movie too. Kid too 😊,The Next Three Days
351,toshi84123,The movie is quite unpredictable.,9,7 June 2013,"I find the film quite unpredictable, keeping all viewers uncertain about what to happen next. This film reminds me of thousands of other similar cases occurring daily somewhere in the world and I feel so sad to think of those unfairly convicted individuals who souls can be hardly saved and pacified unless some left take action to prove their innocence. I've come to think if death penalty practived here in Japan can be justified while leaving the possibilities of wrong sentences.I also felt the strong family ties that made the prison break possible and the passive support (at not preventive) by the old parents, especially the father, who smiled a bit looking at the map of the South American country. I don't know how they have been geeting along with each other and what made the old father so unfriendly to the couple and the kid.",The Next Three Days
352,krperry2-881-408297,Spellbinding!,10,13 January 2020,"I love this movie so much, one of my all time favorites. I actually crave to see it every once in awhile. I think it's so intriguing, suspenseful, engrossing, and one of the most exciting, and best endings EVER! I love how Russell's character is not a slick criminal and that things go wrong. Paul Haggis did a great job with this movie!",The Next Three Days
353,arunwadhwasocial,"Sounds Boring, Is Awesome: A woman gets accused for a murder she didn't commit, her son doesn't kiss her anymore, while her husband is on a fight to get her out of prison.",9,14 June 2014,"How many times we have watched movies of the person doing investigation just to get his/her loved one out of prison? Well, a hell lot of times I'd say. But in this movie, the person gets a step ahead by trying to break-out his beloved wife from prison without even her knowing what he's gonna do. The guy is absolutely away from crime, a normal college teacher, and performs the breakout in the best possible way. It was no doubt an awesome movie.We all have watched Jason Bourne, Eathen Hunt, and other people trying to escape from prisons and helping other people escape them numerous times (Maybe not exactly escaping from prison but from a difficult situation and other stuff like that), but in this story, a guy who knows nothing about crime world tries to do the same, and the biggest part, he does that well. He leaves mis-leading items behind, is at every moment ahead of police, has confidence in himself, and doesn't look back(except for once, LOL). I mean it's just a movie, and these things in movies make no big deal, but the thing is if we imagine this in real life, I mean a normal person helping escape and all that, that's one hell of a thing according to me.",The Next Three Days
354,carolec-76-80708,A Surprise Find,9,2 January 2020,Great movie ... had all the things you want ... a story line that doesn't get bogged down ... a family that wants and believes the real truth and stays together ... the cost of staying together is high and not too diminished ... I was most surprised that I had never heard of it ... glad I found it!!,The Next Three Days
355,jafandozzi,Excellent Movie!,10,27 August 2014,"The Next Three Days is an excellent movie and the fact it was filmed in Pittsburgh, PA makes it even better for me being from PA. In my opinion, out of a handful of movies I have watched staring Russell Crowe, I'd have to say that this is his best performance by far. Liam Neeson is just a bonus. This movie has a lot of twists and turns that will lead you to wonder how the ending is going to be. It kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The Next Three Days shows how an average family struggles when fighting against the law and how desperation is a powerful thing that can overtake you. After watching this film, it makes you think how many people are truly innocent and just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Then you feel terrible watching how difficult it is for families going through situations such as the one in this film. I've watched this movie at least 3 or 4 times and it never gets old. This movie is definitely worth the watch.",The Next Three Days
356,AhmedxYoussef,Very underrated movie,9,30 November 2014,"A film remake of the 2008 French film ""Anything for her"". It's Intense, and keeps you on hook from start to finish. Not to mention the all star cast of Oscar winning performer Russell Crowe, Oscar nominee Liam Neeson, Elizabeth Banks & Olivia Wilde. When you think you have it all figured out, the movie's plot changes still grabbing your attention. Highly recommend it for all those that like a good action/thriller movie. If you're one of those people that like to put logic in a movie, than this film isn't for you as it involves many unrealistic scenes in the movie. If you liked movies like The Fugitive, Law Abiding Citizen & The Departed, this movie is for you.",The Next Three Days

358,drennan_j,I love this movie,10,28 December 2015,"This is the best movie I've seen in 15 years. Maybe the rebel is due for a comeback . . . in the real world. This is the most anti-feminist anti-affirmative action anti-prison-state film of any time. Of course, at least two of those things are recent inventions to be opposed to. The drama and transformation of this protagonist from PW 'nice guy' to brilliant bad-ass is delightfully depicted. This movie is destined to be a classic love story.In terms of movie talk: this film portrays Pittsburgh as a beautiful middle class setting. If you're looking for stoic unhappy family relations then Brian Dennehey and Russell Crowe offer it up in spades. If you like action then just wait a while. And if you like pretty girls then: Elizabeth Banks and Olivia Wilde. Need I say more?",The Next Three Days
359,ansleyrowe,Had so much potential...,2,16 November 2020,"Unfortunately, this film was a total letdown. The cinematography was very good and it was good concept, but the execution and script fell flat. Overall, there were too many holes in the storyline to be compelling. It left the watcher not really rooting for any of the characters despite the fact that the two headlining roles were filled by great actors. It was cold and boring because it wasn't engaging. The characters were entirely underdeveloped and therefore their motivations were unclear.",The Next Three Days

362,dwearle-15295,"A tight, gripping thrill ride!",10,13 August 2017,"All in all, I have to say this is the best drama-suspense movie I have seen in years, even though it was released in 2010, and I am making this review in 2017. Russel Crowe is superb as a stunned husband, and father, who just couldn't accept the guilty conviction of his wife in the murder of her boss, and decides that he isn't going to rest, knowing she would be imprisoned for life. Enter Liam Neeson who, although plays a VERY SHORT appearance in the film, 'counsels' Russel Crowe on how to break someone out of prison, as he (Neeson) is a former prison escapee.From there, the film becomes almost nightmarish in the 'what's next' aspect, as with every turn of event, you almost think Russel Crowe's character will either give up on the notion of breaking his wife out of prison, or he will get himself killed trying. From murdering a meth-lab owner for the money he needed to pull it all off, to getting beat up, and robbed, you just never know what to expect as this one evolves, which earns it my highest rating of 10. I don't usually go this much into detail with my reviews, but this one definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. Each time I had to get up, and pause the movie, I had to rush through whatever it was I had to do, just to get back to the movie, so I wouldn't lose pace, or track of what had been happening when I paused it. This one is definitely worth a watch, and even watched a couple more times.",The Next Three Days
