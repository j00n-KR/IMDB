0,SnoopyStyle,it's ok,6,13 May 2020,"Pete Koslow (Joel Kinnaman) is a convict forced to work for FBI agents Wilcox (Rosamund Pike) and Montgomery (Clive Owen) to infiltrate a Polish drug gang led by The General. An undercover NYPD cop tries to make a buy from Montgomery. He quickly makes the cop and tries to talk him out of the situation. Instead, The General's nephew Stazek kills the cop. Pete is forced to take fall as Stazek holds his wife Sofia (Ana de Armas) and their daughter Anna. Pete has to go back to prison. NYPD detective Grens (Common) investigates and suspects a cover up.It tries to be a harden police corruption crime drama but it can't measure up. My initial feeling about the killing is that it's unlikely. While the bad FBI agents are a good excuse, the movie doesn't really explain why Pete was kept off-books. Pete also has the annoying habit of keeping Sofia in the dark. That leads to the annoying repetition of scenes where Sofia keeps pleading with Pete. At this point, the FBI has the drug deals and Stazek for murder. If they can't use the evidence for that, then there is no point in the undercover work in the first place. This is a simplistic thriller trying to sell itself as something more sophisticated. As long as one doesn't ask too many questions, this is a fine little thriller.",The Informer
1,nogodnomasters,Are you a cop?,4,14 October 2019,"Pete (Joel Kinnaman ) is working an an informer for the FBI. Their goal is to take down ""The General"" and his drug operation. The plan had to be aborted when a cop was killed. The General wants Pete to go to prison and run a drug operation. The FBI thinks it is a good idea for him to go to prison and get the details. Things don't go well while he is in prison either.This is a me-too crime film. Pike is better as a ""Gone"" girl than an FBI agent. The whole film had a me-too aspect to it.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Informer
2,kosmasp,In too deep,8,15 January 2020,"Sometimes you dig yourself into a hole. Many times others help with the digging. Question is, are you able to come out of it? When is the point you should realize you should stop digging? And are you even able to stop? Questions that might break the movie, but you should not be too harsh with it.The acting is really good, the story holds up (if you overlook the obvious holes in the story that is), tension is quite good. A thriller that ticks all the right boxes and should be able to rub you the right way.",The Informer
3,CinemaSerf,"Not a great deal of depth to this, but a strong lead performance makes it watchable.",6,10 December 2019,"At times, this is quite an engrossing crime drama about a convict who goes back into prison to help the FBI tackle a dodgy European drug lord and in so doing confronts his fair share of betrayal and authority corruption too. Joel Kinnaman holds this violent thriller together quite well but the rest of the cast really struggle to make much impact and it does dip in the middle somewhat. Somebody, somewhere, has clearly decided that Ana de Armas is one to watch - thus far in her career, however, the reasons why are escaping me and Rosamund Pike - even in ""Gone Girl"" - always seems a bit too detached to me; whatever her role.",The Informer
4,zardoz-13,A Gritty Underworld Prison Thriller,7,31 December 2020,"""Escobar: Paradise Lost"" director Andrea Di Stefano's gritty underworld crime thriller ""The Informer,"" toplining Swedish/American actor Joel Kinnaman, ranks as an above-average prison break yarn whose credibility wears thin about a quarter of an hour before fadeout. Although he starred in the theatrical ""RoboCop"" (2014) remake and joined the cast as Rick Flag in ""Suicide Squad"" (2016), you may be more familiar with Kinnaman's co-stars, namely Rosamund Pike, Common, Ana de Armas, and Clive Owen, than with the Swedish/American. The tall, lanky actor with gimlet eyes, who bears a striking resemblance to actor Keith Carradine, hasn't landed that major movie role yet which would confer household name recognition. Nevertheless, he gives a good account of himself as a volatile ex-con harassed and betrayed by the Polish Mafia, the FBI, and the NYPD, in this adaptation of Anders Roslund and Borge Hellstrom's bestselling 2009 novel ""Three Seconds."" The filmmakers have shifted the setting from Scandinavia to New York City. Basically a polished B-movie boasting several good scenes, ""The Informer"" has no shortage of intrigue and action. As far as informant movies go, this complex take on the genre bristles with double and triple crosses that should occasionally surprise you like somebody sneaking up behind you on phantom feet and tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it. Kinnaman's utterly sympathetic hero finds himself at the mercy of several unsavory villains eager to snuff him out. The circuitous twists and turns in the screenplay penned by Matt Cook of ""Triple 9,"" Rowan Joffe of ""The American,"" and Di Stefano are comparable to the wicked spirals in a barbed wire fence. Ostensibly, ""The Informer"" adheres to much of what took place in the award-winning novel. Apart from the change of setting, the film substitutes the deadly opioid fentanyl for the novel's use of amphetamines as the contraband which our hero must smuggle into the prison. Clive Owen stands out as Rosamund Pike's arrogant FBI boss in this tense R-rated epic.A second-generation Pole who distinguished himself during four tours of duty in the Gulf War as a highly decorated sniper, Pete Koslow (Joel Kinnaman) survived combat in Iraq, but suffered afterward from post-traumatic stress disorder. Initially, FBI agent Wilcox paroled Koslow from prison where he was pulling a 20-year stretch for killing a foul-mouthed biker in a brawl who had insulted his wife. After Wilcox's FBI superior Keith Montgomery (Clive Owen of ""Killer Elite"") approves Koslow as her snitch, she embeds him in the Polish mob. As ""The Informer"" unfolds, we learn Koslow must sell 6kg of fentanyl smuggled in diplomatic pouches through the Polish embassy. Suddenly, everything goes sideways for Koslow when his cronies make an impromptu stop to sell product to a Latino gangster. Pete suspects the Latino, Daniel Gomez (Arturo Castro of ""Bushwick""), may be an undercover NYPD cop. He resorts to intimidation tactics to frighten off the Latino without exposing the latter's identity to the trigger-happy gunman Stazek. Unfortunately, the frustrated narc pulls his pistol on him. Stazek (Mateusz Kosciukiewicz of ""Suicide Room"") shoots Gomez in the back. This murder occurs while Pete is wired up and Wilcox is listening. She cancels the FBI operation immediately and disperses her team. Stazek and his accomplices sink the narc's mutilated body in the river. Afterward, Stazek ushers Pete into the presence of notorious General Klimek (Eugene Lipinski of ""Rollerball"") who explains the demise of an NYPD cop is ""bad for business."" As the General sees it, Stazek saved Pete's life when he shot the narc. Now, the General coerces Pete to break his parole, go back to prison to serve out his original sentence, and smuggle the fentanyl into the facility. The General wants him back in Bale Hill Prison in two days. Klimek lays it out for Pete. ""With fentanyl, we can have tens of thousands hooked on our product."" He predicts that with those hooked inside and those hitting the streets after their release, the Poles will have an army at their disposal. Predictably, Peter is reluctant about going back to prison. He fears for the lives of his wife, Sofia (Ana de Armas of ""Knock Knock""), and his teenage daughter Anna (newcomer Karma Meyer), when he accepts the General's ultimatum. Naturally, this surprises the FBI, but Wilcox convinces Montgomery that they can still bust the General with Pete back in prison. Imagine Pete's paranoia as he reenters Bale Hill.Not only does ""The Informer"" benefit from Andrea Di Stefano's energetic helming, but also his stauch editing. He orchestrates a variety of subplots with agility. This nimble crosscutting enhances the film's spontaneity as well as its suspense, making its 113 minutes tolerable. When he isn't putting Koslow through the wringer, Di Stefano intensifies the treacherous relationship between Clive Owen's obnoxious FBI superior and Rosamund Pike's naïve field agent. The best movies keep their heroes behind the eight ball until the finale. Indeed, Di Stefano and company never let poor Koslow off the hook, especially at fadeout when the procedural issues surrounding his case linger. Treading a tightrope between good and evil, Rosamund Pike's conflicted FBI agent Wilcox struggles to maintain her own virtue. She convinces Pete to re-enter prison, but Montgomery is prepared to burn both of them if the operation goes sideways. Detective Grens (Common of ""American Gangster"") enters the picture as Gomez's vengeful NYPD superior. He poses a serious threat to both Pete and the FBI. Sadly, we don't see nearly enough of Eugene Lipinski's insidious General who disappears far too early and doesn't pay the piper. As the General's homicidal henchman, Mateusz Kosciukiewicz is so oily you may applaud his comeuppance. As a sadistic prison guard, Sam Spruell is so sinister you cringe when he wields his clout. No matter what happens, everybody both inside and outside of Bale Hill prison manipulates our hero.A robust pastiche of crime & prison movies, ""The Informer"" mingles both genres with enough gusto to make its cliches captivating once again.",The Informer
5,bombersflyup,"Watchable, standard fare.",4,11 March 2021,"The Informer is well acted and executed fine, it's just not quite gripping or memorable.With Joel Kinnaman, Ana de Armas, Rosamund Pike and Clive Owen, who could say no? Problem is, the film's quite generic and tame for something like this. Also why have Common play a main character, with this cast at your disposal. There's little resolution and Owen's character getting tricked at the end, pretty weak.",The Informer
6,phd_travel,Improbable story,4,26 September 2019,"This movie felt long. A convicted killer is released and helps the FBI take down some Polish drug lord. But things get complicated when a NYPD cop gets killed. In this scenario you have to bear in mind the FBI are the bad guys and the NYPD the good guys.
Good points: The complex story is clearly and painstakingly told and explained so at least you are not confused what is going on.
Bad points: Sleep inducing through much of the middle. Ugly looking. The escape at the end is highly improbable. Acting wise: Rosamund Pike's face is too blank for the role.",The Informer

8,ops-52535,"COME ON LADS, LETS CUT AWAY THE BEST PARTS....",7,23 December 2019,"Seems to be my immediate reaction ater viewing ''the informer'' it is by all means a terrificly good thriller with a lot of suspence and heavy intrigues, but i still feel especially in the second half we are robbed for some good plotparts that shouldve been there or havent been made at all. that there will be a sequel to this is for sure. there are also a high score on underdeveloped characters to make this a superb juristiction battle with undertones of politics, and screenplay wise its not much the filmstars can make a difference on when shut up or cut off by the editors and directors hand.but by all means, its thrilling, even though the grumpy old man as a consultant could have made it even better, but i dont think they have the budget to economic power to hire me for consultancy. but have a look, i can recommend that",The Informer
9,cruise01,Lackluster thriller that gets lost with a loose story and tedious direction.,5,22 December 2020,2.5 out of 5 stars.The Informer is a dull thriller about an Informer Pete (Joel Kinnaman) who is undercover for an FBI agent. But when an officer is killed that draws the attention played by Common. Pete has to go to prison to get info to bring a drug lord down. Stakes are higher when his family is threatened.Boring story. Dull direction that leaves a lot of loose ends. Tedious acting. It is one thriller that is forgettable.,The Informer
10,Dr_Coulardeau,Very sad ending,8,30 April 2020,"A convict free on parole is working undercover for the FBI. He intentionally though reluctantly gets himself incarcerated again in order to infiltrate the prison-mob at a maximum-security prison and guarantee drugs' providing to the prisoners for the boss of the gang he is following for the FBI. He just had to break his parole. Some staged domestic violence will be enough. But an extremely rotten and ambitious FBI area boss moves over the FBI agent for whom Pete Koslow was the informer and decides to get rid of him and have him executed inside the prison, burning at the same time the operation against the gang and satisfying himself with getting two underlings.But an agent in NYPD decides to teach the FBI a lesson and to save Pete Koslow who is warned by a black prisoner about what is going to happen so that he manages not to be killed, but to kill his white assailant and then to take hostage one warden and to get loose in the prison where he stages a hectic and wild escape. He is helped in it by the FBI agent he was an informer for and manages to escape from the ambulance when he was transferred to a hospital as the warden he had taken hostage and was killed in Pete's prison clothes when Pete had put on the hostage's uniform and identification.The NYPD agent will finish the job and provide him with a passport and documents necessary for him to escape after seeing his wife and daughter in Central Park, from a distance and assessing all the FBI agents around them ready to terminate him.We all know the FBI is rotten and the police are not much better. At least that is common in many films and series. We all know prisons are the best crime schools on the planet and that real power is money and no matter what crimes you may have committed, you will always be the boss in the prison if you have the money you need to buy the wardens and the stuff you need to satisfy the ""commercial"" demand among the prisoners. Prisons are a real crime university and a fully-free-trade market-economy, all managed from some clandestine crime authority, outside the prisons, of course, provided with direct or indirect lobbying agents everywhere necessary.Entertaining but not outstanding. Especially since the ending is really sad.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Informer

Not a crowd pleaser, but certainly still worth watching for those who like to see a bleak gangster thriller, with an intelligent plot. Good acting performances by the leading actors.Any bad? A few supporting actors were mediocre and a bit irritating to watch. Some of the plot turns were not very believable. Because of these (smaller) faults, it falls short of becoming a true gangster classic. Nevertheless I am quite impressed with this movie, which I accidentally bumped in to...",The Informer
13,kwenchow,Another worst film! Too many talking! The action not intense and bored! Not recommended!,1,1 January 2020,"This film start with a man ""Pete"" talking on the phone, he sent away his wife ""Sofia"" to a shelter, and he have a mission to infiltrate the drug dealer with the FBI scene! As turnout, this film is about Pete need to get into the prison to help his mob boss running the drug business, he also need to help the FBI to infiltrate a target criminal in the prison and another NYPD officer ""Grens"" also suspect Pete murder his colleague! Entire film quite slow and full of boring conversation! The action also not intense and not satisfy! Barely intense scene is, Grens saving Pete's wife and daughter from the killing of a bunch of mobster! This scene have shooting at the leg and at the head scene! A bit bloody! At the end, Pete capture a warden as a hostage, he wearing the warden uniform to distract the police! The police eventually shot dead the warden, Pete survive from the explosion of the gas tank!

14,henry8-3,The Informer,5,23 August 2020,"An uncover ex con (Kinnaman) must save his family by going undercover back in prison to ensure the drug lord - The General - is put away.Gritty and involving plot with many a twist and turn that does get the juices flowing. It is a little complex and at times stretches credulity a touch, but overall an exciting and well made thriller. Kinnaman is fine and there's a strong supporting cast with de Armas the best thing here, as his wife and Owen, playing the nasty FBI boss who couldn't care less about our hero's future.Let down very slightly by a fairly familiar ending that hints at a sequel, although this seems unlikely.",The Informer
15,jimbo-53-186511,Bits & Pieces,5,18 April 2021,"Ex-convict Pete Koslow is working undercover as an informer for the FBI in an attempt to bring down a Polish mob boss. However, things go awry during the undercover operation and Koslow is effectively forced to go back to prison in order to expose the mob bosses activities within a local jail and finish what he and the FBI had started....The Informer, for me, gave me somewhat mixed feelings; essentially made up of bits and pieces of greatness without entirely coming together as a cohesive whole...It starts off promisingly, but once Koslow ends up in prison it starts to become a bit messy; he's supposed to be in prison as part of an 'infiltration operation' but there's precious little of this actually happening when he's in prison. I was half expecting a clever film showing how Koslow slowly digs out all the dirt to bring the mob boss down, but it soon becomes apparent that this film is not really about that as it soon gets bogged down in a cliched narrative involving 'corruption within the FBI again.....'. Nothing wrong with this per se, but nothing is really done with The Informer to make it interesting as it aimlessly plods along its derivative route.I think what makes it worse is that there isn't really any closure at the end such as what happened to the mob boss for example? It's possible that the film may have been left incomplete on purpose to make way for a sequel. Other notable problems with The Informer is its general lack of action, its doddering pace, sloppy writing and sluggish direction. Given its premise I honestly expected more and think it would have been a lot better had it done 'exactly what it said on the tin' which to me it didn't.Still I have to say that there were some tense moments, but again only here and there and the acting wasn't bad; Clive Owen can play these sleazy corrupt types in his sleep and was the highlight of the film. Gorgeous Ana De Armas was also a nice distraction through some of the more tedious aspects of the film and Joel Kinnaman also put in a reasonably good performance.The Informer's imbalance is perhaps its biggest weakness; to me it never really seemed to settle on one particular theme and just felt a little messy and rough around the edges. There wasn't enough action to keep me entertained and the story wasn't particularly well focused meaning I found myself detached from proceedings a little too often. In the end, I felt it was never quite the film that it could have been.",The Informer

Here the excellent Kinnaman plays an ex-con named ""Pete Koslow"" who has to help the FBI put away a polish Druglord but he gets into a hell of a lot of danger when an undercover Cop gets killed & he has to go back to prison, that's a little bit of the big complex story, just watch the incredible performances from Kinnaman, Common & Roseamund Pike, all give it their all in this gritty & incredibly intense Crime Thriller, there's Corruption here & a harsh reality to this movie, it's totally believable & you really feel for Kinnaman as Pete as he has a wife & a little girl, so the stakes are high here & the drama is engulfing.

18,valleyjohn,Pretty good crime thriller,7,5 June 2020,"I'm not sure why The Informer didn't get much publicity when it was released last summer , perhaps it didn't get a cinematic release here in the UK ( Even though Wikipedia calls this a British thriller for some reason ! ) because it's a pretty good crime thriller that deserves an audience.It's the story of ex-convict working undercover in a
polish crime syndicate who intentionally gets himself incarcerated again in order to infiltrate the mob at a maximum security prison.With a really good cast such as Common , Rosamund Pike and Clive Owen , this really does feel like a blockbuster movie. Sure , it's ridiculously far fetched but it's one of those films that you are not meant to take seriously.I found it entertaining despite it being unbelievable at times .

The acting was first rate except perhaps for Joel Kinnaman who had the look but mumbled his way through a very stiff performance. Not a good start as in many ways the film rested on him.2, the cinematography was good and helped the tension and narrative flow.What was problematic1, too little variety in the movie, all we had was threat menace and betrayal2, the plot was labyrinthine, keep it simple.3, some of the turns were ridiculous, the NYPD cop arrived on his own to sort out a shoot out. The FBI had authority to act and then tried to conceal their actions. Criminal gangs rarely accept new members so the police try to turn existing members. The hostage scene was absurd as any idiot can spot a prisoner from a guard.4, the informer's wife Sophia had the acting skills of a dead ant, the AB school of acting.5, the clash of theatre and method acting was so marked I laughed aloud.This was a boys movie with questionable acting and an absurd script, such a shame when you consider the calibre of actors involved.",The Informer

I thought cast was really good like Joel Kinnaman who did Suicide Squad, remake of Robocop, Killing series, Alerted Carbon, Run all Night who did good as lead role film I like cinematography I liked style of mob film I liked his character in film but I wish this was a lot like Escape Plan mixed with Brawl Cell Block 99 type of prison film full on gore brutal film but it doesn't go on that point. this story follows Pete Koslow (Joel Kinnman) who is a ex-convict working undercover intentionally gets himself incarcerated again a job was hired by Montgomery (Clive Owen) and also you have Wilcox (Rosamund Pike) was in it as well as cop. they want Pete to infiltrate the mob at a maximum security prison. so he has to go prison but in theirs a twist later on witch I won'tspoil it in film that kept him in prison so he was later set up so now on he is stuck at prison. I liked other cast like (Common) Grens who plays an cop in film, I also liked Ana de Armas who is in every single movie now I seen her in. If you go into this expecting a $100 million action blockbuster or an full on action film then you will be Pissed off the direction of film A strong lead performance by Joel Kinnaman holds the story together and the film moves swiftly at a pace that never drags. If you want a film that gives you actual story over bigger films with full of superhero films nowadays witch it sucks. with all leads playing their respective roles on point, especially Joel Kinnaman who nailed his character. I liked performance the thrilling keeps you watching their some nice smart things in film locationsets authentic. My only critique would be the pacing needed to be short the film felt a bit long and it didn't get to the point with action or thriller it was just start of film where it was kept going slow then something happens like middle of film, it's not a b grade film it's not low budgeted film it's a film was gonna be released at theaters but then COVID-19 happened so that's why some went to Blu ray and DVD that's why sadly. if you have interest in film check it out but don't expect big action like you saw on trailer. trailer was a false advisement it's not an full on kicking hardcore action sometimes theirs a difference with trailer and film because the trailer made it look like a full on action kicking ass with a hip hop song thinking oh yeah it's a full on action but when you watch film it's a thriller, crime, drama I am just saying this so because so that it doesn't fool on anybody who is interest to watch this movie to know what kinda genre it is",The Informer
35,akcenat,"Not a bad movie per se, just excessively predictable B-crime thriller",7,10 August 2020,"Adapted from best-selling novel 'Three Seconds',""The Informer"" is sort of thriller that is trotted out just about every year, with little in the way of variation, which puts the viewer into familiar even comfortable territory. The story would have been benefited more if it was a miniseries. It also doesn't encourage repeat viewings and by the end of the year, you'll probably have forgotten all about it. Basically, film do suffers from a crammed plot, including all the cliches of a crime thriller and a prison movie as well. Main character is the flawed but essentially good guy trapped in a hole that just gets deeper. The climax although gripping, seems highly unlikely and stretches credibility to breaking point. The movie does have a great cast (Joel Kinnaman, Rosamund Pike, Clive Owen, Common) but thanks to that crammed plot they just aren't given enough to do. Ultimately, ""The Informer"" is an entertaining - albeit underwhelming - crime thriller, that doesn't necessarily bring anything new to the table but still stands, as well-acted popcorn movie.Rating:6/7-",The Informer

director: Andrea De stefano
starring: Joel Kinnamon,Rosamund pike,Ana de armas,Common,Clive own etcoverall rating 73/100When ex convict Pete coslow gets involved with a shooting of a NYPD cop. He has to go back to prison in order to stop a drug gang from getting away with there crimes. But the lifes of his wife and child is at risk and its up to officer wilcox ( rosamund pike) to help him be reunited with his family. The informer was a good thriller but a flawed film, but still thoroughly entertaining lets get into why this is.First of all the film did a fantastic job of delivering an incredibly tense tone. The film did a fantastic job with keeping you on the edge of your seat. in fact i think this is up there with the most tense and unsettling films of the year in my opinion. The film just put the audience through so many uncomfortable situations. and with the lack of soundtrack it really helped with the authenticity of the film. Whether it was being attacked in the prison or in my opinion the most uncomfortable scene when the main characters wife and child was being gagged and threatened. Also the violence and gore helped with the entertainment value of the film. But also added to the tense tone and impact of each scene with a heads up some very gory things that were borderline 18 rating in my opinion.however my first issue is the slow pacing in the first half of the film. In my opinion the first half of the film was very slow and made me lose interest a few times. There was just a lot of filler conversations and standing around that left me needing something to spice the film up and make it more entertaining. But luckily they more then redeemed themselves in the second half of the film where it had a absolutely fantastic final act. They really went all out in the last half of the film to make you care about all of the characters and to keep you on the edge of your seat. With all the action was non stop within the last 30/45 minutes of the film so this more then made up for the first half of the film.Next i think the informer had a good amount of emotional weight to it. The fact that Joel Kinnamons character. Just wanted to get to his family and the love he showed them really made his character more respected in my opinion. And you related to him a bit more because most people are close to there families so being away from them is hard so everyone could
passively relate to his emotional state with his wife and kid.Next i think they really portrayed the harsh reality of prison life really well. A lot of films with prisons in can be very tame with what they show maybe due to the age rating but this film. Showed the types of people the horrible conditions that prisoners rightly have to go through so this was just a nice touch to see. However i do have to say that the film was very stereotypical with what type if inhabitants take up prisons. I think having a lot of the prisoners black and to have it split by colour is fairly old fashioned and they should of picked a more diverse group of people.Now my final two positives would be the fantastic acting was Joel Kinnamon and Rosamund pike. Rosamund pike was fantastic in the cop role. She was clever and did not take no for a answer whilst also having a kind heart and a nag for doing the right thing. And joel Kinnamon showed great diversity in the film. His character had a great blend of intimidation,vulnerability and perseverance and despite maybe not agreeing with some of his actions largely he was a character that you could support.However i do have to end on my final two negatives. First of all there was next to no character development or depth to most of the characters. Most of the characters were very one dimensional. And Petes wife did next to nothing in the film apart from being Petes motivation she was just a damsel in distress which was a shame considering the films of today with strong female characters. And finally there was some incredibly dislikable characters. Some of joels workmates who killed policemen and threatened his wife and kid were just sick and really made you not like there characters. I know this was the goal but for whatever reason something was off about some of the characters that really made you question the reasoning for them being there in the script.Overall the informer is a thoroughly entertaining and tense thriller with excellent acting. But is narratively flawed and could used with more developed and likeable characters.",The Informer

42,Brooklynsmagicmike,I heavily enjoyed this movie until the ending.,7,9 November 2020,Actually was surprised by how much I liked this B-movie. It had good pacing and a great cast with good acting from all partys. This movie plays more like crime/drama then action packed flick although there are some scenes featuring action. The pacing was good as well and the movie never felt slow or draggy at times at all.What killed this movie for me in my opinion was the ending. I would have given an 10 out 10 otherwise. Without giving to much away I felt that there should been something more intense happening after everything the main character went through. But instead it was just left simple and kind of open ended.Other then that I would recommend this movie for everyone to see thats into this type of genre of films.,The Informer
43,movieman6-413-929510,The Informer is a standard crime thriller without real unique suspense.,5,28 December 2019,"The Informer is a new crime thriller directed and partly written by Andrea Di Stefano, the director of Escobar: Paradise Lost.The film is about special agent Pete Koslow (Joel Kinnaman), who was imprisoned. If the FBI tries to get information about a major New York criminal with his help, Pete must go to jail again undercover.
If something goes wrong during the secret mission, Pete loses contact with the FBI. Without this support, Pete must personally remain undercover to get the information he needs and find a way to get the information back to the FBI.This film comes across as standard with a well-known story about an undercover agent who gets stuck in a prison and finds his own way out of the prison. The Al Pacino movie The Recruit also had a similar story. The film also looks a bit like a lesser film version of the television series Prison Break. In contrast to other similar stories, this film also has no unexpected plottwist and so it soon comes across as well-known and long-winded.The acting is also not that special. Joel Kinnaman plays his role again in the same way that he also plays with most of his roles in other films. Rosamund Pike plays an FBI agent in the film, but she can act better than the acting work that she delivers in this film. This role actually comes across as a role that she plays to earn some extra money. Clive Owen also plays an FBI agent with a higher position. According to the story, his character comes from America, but he nevertheless retains his English accent throughout the film and thus appears rather uncomfortable and unbelievable than as a serious FBI agent.",The Informer

53,therskybznuiss,"Really strong narrative with some weak elements, which did not detract from my 'viewing experience.'",8,1 June 2021,"First of all, I must say, that this movie, a B-movie, with AAA elements, with some expertise takes us as the viewer and drops us into an already well-developed story which has obviously been on-going since well-before we are introduced to Joel' character. It is done quite well as we are dropped into this plot right at a watershed moment as the FBI manipulate and connive their way into complete control with a very realistic, not just lack of care, but straight malcontent for our hero's safety. That's all I will say of the plot, other than how I really admired how each character we are introduced to feel just as well thought out as our main character and how even a character we see only for -45 seconds does, says or even implies something which is crucial in developing the whole story.This movie reminds me of one of old where it's focus is singular and therefore much stronger in delivering a few, simple messages or invoking a few complex emotion's and I really cared about our hero, his family and even felt compassion for one of the main villains by the end.I dont know why the pro-review world bombed this so hard. Are they uncomfterble with this movie's (true) statements on the twistedness of law-enforcement corruption which has only evolved terribly into something more undetectable and probably more damaging than that of old?I don't know, but for a dark movie, released in a crap year with some strong and noble statements, I was quite impressed.

70,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,Odd One,8,9 January 2020,"The Informer is described as a British crime thriller about Polish gangsters in NYC a film directed by Andrea Di Stefano; an Italian director. The main actor is a Swede, then 2 British actors Rosamund Pike,Clive Owen,then a Cuban Ana de Armas and one American rapper named Common.Globalize this!Filming happens in Pinewood Studios (UK), Iver Heath (UK), Gloucester Prison (UK) and Brooklyn, New York (US).Clive Owen finds it practically impossible to maintain an American accent for more than a sentence or two and even then it is half-hearted. When conversing with Rosamund (UK) he drops all pretense and then mimetically she too; they might as well be having tea in Surrey; discussing which Public School (Private to Americans) they are going to put their offspring in; but in that scene they are FBI agents in NYC ... QEDShe at times could be an FBI agent, she looks the part some of the time. He never does; he walks like a posh Englishman in every frame. Why use Europeans if you make an American film? Simply do not get it. Have they run out of American actors?A European director. Yes. But the actors. Big puzzle.One is reminded of those spaghetti Westerns of the 70s. But were the actors not always American. Pretty sure they were.What next? A biopic of Gandhi filmed in Albania with Whoopi Goldberg in the main role; mind you last time they used Ben Kingsley at least they got the gender right; maybe there were not enough Indians to choose from ...So not being American I have no idea how all these actors look like as American FBI agents and gangster toughs; but to me it looks VERY contrived.SO : this film does not work then?Actually it really does work. The rhythm is excellent all the way through there is just a moment 2 thirds in when we are not sure who is working for whom anymore but it clears up quick. There is only one or two unpleasant violent scenes, the rest is ok.
At all times you feel sorry for the main character; the way in which all piles up on him; he becomes a Christic baddie in some ways ..Both Ana de Armas and Joel Kinnaman are excellent here and Rosamund Pike at times.

Joel is a top actor and carries this film. Rosamund is a strong second. I was pulled to the screen/ edge of my seat watching this. My only hang up is the actress that played his wife.

90,spasticfreakshow,could have been something w/o the damsel in distress trope,5,21 June 2020,"It's not an outrageously original script, but the acting and directing were good enough to elevate the script, if not for the damsel in distress wife and daughter who are too inane to feed themselves, much less follow simple instructions.It's not the 1950s. Guess this new-ish writer has failed to notice that and lives in a cave, but for the rest of us, that's not just cliche and old, it's jumped the shark. A guy that smart doesn't go for a blow-up doll who stays in place when told to run. Sorry, that's just weak, lazy writing, and I felt pity for de Armas for having to act that out in a film that wasn't meant to be noir, nor filmed in black and white. DUH.

It shows that and then does this really sudden cut IMMEDIATELY to him shooting out the tires having already somehow used the gun to take over and get the ambulance pulled over. Driver included is tied up.
Now.... Thats a huge jump to happen while showing us NOTHING of it. Ok we get that she had a gun avaliable for him but... What?? How. How did he take over EVERYONE including the driver? Of all the stretched out unnecessary parts of this 2 hour movie they chose to cut short on THAT part?? I was so confused I went back to see if I blinked and missed something. Nope. It was just simply not included. Hes on the table one second and the next hes got everyone tied up outside on the ground. Crazy.
Otherwise. Great movie.

But moving around in prison is too easy, as is the escape and all the subsequent events. You can't fault the actors for working with what they are given, but it falls flat as a movie because of the lack of realism. Plus marks for not relying on fancy effects or gruesome violence, but really can't give it more than a 5 for where it goes after a strong beginning and all the elements for a really good thriller.

101,travisammons,I Complain A Lot But This Wasn't So Baf,6,8 July 2021,"Slow start with this one, the first 7 minutes felt like 20. I think The filmmakers are trying to show you how much red tape they have to go through before they actually initiate a bust. Me? I couldn't care less. Finally some (I think) French dudes show up with copious amounts of drugs. Now we're getting somewhere but wait. We have to stop at the liquor store first! Then bam! We are in what looks like a empty stripper joint. And the (6 keys!) drug deal is suddenly taking place. Arturo Castro just rolls up in the scene, always good to see him. Arturo says he can only do three keys, tops, and he has to go get most of it. Things go south quick, the racial slurs begin and poor Arturo gets killed. The cops surrounding the building all speed off and our obvious by now lead, Joel Kinneman, gets outta that scene unscathed. He goes to a dive bar for a drink.Next we learn Joel's real name is Piotr and also that he has this (Russian?) boss, Mr Klimek. He quickly proves himself to be diabolical. I don't know if this guy is a judge in his country or what but he sends him to the big-house for a five year stretch.But he doesn't go to jail, he goes to this cutie's house, Anna is her daughter's name, didn't catch her name but she literally cleans him up and we finally meet some new characters. Common, for one, is the lead investigator. We follow him from some crime scene then stops the city that mean nada.Then more exposition I guess, I call it filler but the cutie either was or became his wife by the Time we have a dinner party outside of the generals house with Carmen across the street watching with his badge and gun. Then we go to jail finally, I guess he just had a few days to him wrap things up. Most of the prison staff remember him. Prison, as one might suspect, is not too much fun. But we dont have to stay there too long. After all we still have to introduce Clive Owen! Common's not a fan of ole' Clive and tells him off. Clive: he doesn't say a word. So some other typical stuff happens, he gets jumped, someone gives him a shiv and this group of brothers lynch him up for dead (in the Church!) but these three or four guys saved him, for some reason, right after he admitted he was a snitch!! Bunch of stuff happens, most of inconsequential until he manages a phone call to cutie in her blue fish shop. Per fish, not like on the docks and stuff. Cutie sells the tapes to Rosamund Pike (she made her uneventful entrance a few scenes ago). Joel picks a fight with this white jailhouse dude so that he can get to the authorities so he can at least find someone who can contact his department head. So they know he's really a cop, remember? Hard to be sure you're following this, I sure had a hard time mapping out ALL the (mostly un-needed) plot-points. I'm being harsh because this is a pretty good script with fine actor, the editors don't really consistently build the pace. It had many long, un-needed chunks, including several dialogue scenes!

Unless you wanted the protagonist to become an indestructible superman similar to Liam Neeson in Taken. Apart from that, the plot is engaging, convincing and the pace is smooth enough to never bore me. For me it deserves an 8. In short, everything ok except the conclusion, even if it was cool as well to watch it due to the pathos and the final idea (escaping the prison with swapping the cloths with the Guardian).

There's even a full scene missing, not to get into details this is the type of scenes that can easily be cut in a super hero type movie for comedic purposes or to show how badass the character is, but in that type of movie it just seems out of place.Ultimately that might be the problem with this movie, it show itself like a crime movie, but it presents the principal character like a possible superhero.

It doesn't help that the audio mixing is terrible rendering much of the dialogue unintelligible.Joel Kinnaman does his best to portray a believable character, but Clive Owen is his usual wooden self.

They might not have had the budget, they might not have been able to get a talented cast, they may have had to cut corners on the locations using their own houses and cars to film in. The Informer was held back by none of these issues. It is let down by a lack of effort and care.Without going into the details of the film (I'd hate to ruin it any more than they already have), The story is paint by numbers, it's straight out of the Hallmark playbook. If you're surprised anything that happens in this film then welcome to the made for TV thriller market, they're all like this. The characters are ridiculously stock. The wife and daughter exists only to have someone to threaten, the head of the Polish mafia is comically bad and I've seen more threatening characters on Sesame Street. We have the obligatory bent prison guard and all the normal evil yet honourable prisoners.And as for the main three characters. Joel Kinnaman who I love in most things tries his best but he simply has no character development, you don't feel like you really know him or ultimately care what happens to him. Rosamund Pike is clearly an extremely talented actress but she suffers the same fate, you believe her struggles slightly more than Joel's but I'm not sure I cared anymore because of how weak and pathetic she is. Finally we have Common who plays the pissed off NY Cop. He's solid, but again he just feels like any other angry NY police officer, nothing at all has been done to set the character part.There is little to no action, although his path is a crappy one everything seems to fall perfectly for our anti-hero, if the end is supposed to be a twist it was drawn with a ruler.This is simply a waste for 113 minutes of your life.

Joel Kinnamon is usually excellent and he was here as well.What I liked most besides the action was the it's dynamics; every character plays a crucial role in the dwevelopment of the plot. They all 'feel' like they have very real and well hashed backstory's and even if they only have a line or two, they feel just as well thought out as the protagonist.This movie won't be for everyone.

153,Good_Fences,Not good but not bad.,5,8 August 2021,"Don't really know what else to say about it. It tries to be a crime drama, but most of it is absolutely absurd, as a lot of people have already pointed out. The thing about a drama is that I'm supposed to be able to empathize with the characters, but I can't do that if they aren't relatable and the plot is just ridiculous. I feel like this movie would've been a lot better if they would've just went the action route with it instead of trying to make it a drama. Also, the ending is just dumb. Every actor in this movie can do better.",The Informer

161,tobycross,"Great acting, tight script, gritty",8,30 August 2019,"What a nice change to get away from the 'typical' Holywood action flick and to get into a grittier, morally ambiguous, uncompromising drama. Rosamund Pike continues to prove what a great actor she is with a performance that echoes her character in Beirut. Joel Kinnaman gives a performance that is just as conflicted and compelling as Altered Carbon. Altogether a great cast that manages to build realistic characters. My only criticism of the script is the overly detailed explanation of fentanyl that Pike gives to her team on FBI agents - it's the only point where you feel the film patronises the audience. Other than that, a thoroughly enjoyable movie.",The Informer

Just not quite anything.The movie lurches from one ridiculous scene to another without much regard for reality or sense. The evil crime boss is a terrible caricature of ""mob boss"". Supposed good guys make nonsensical decisions that defy basic belief. Meanwhile one long good guy cracks the system wide open all by himself and without apparently following any procedures.I had no idea what this movie was about going into it and about half way through I was bored to tears.

A really decent crime thriller. I gave it 9/10 only bc of a couple scenes which could've been touched up. Still, overall, a pretty solid movie. I'd even rank this better than A History of Violence!

179,satvik-sharma,Underrated Crime Thriller,8,5 January 2020,"The Informer is a tense, gripping crime drama/thriller which keeps you engaged from the very first enthralling scene. A tight screenplay is backed by good performances and some raw action which never goes overboard. Sure, it is far from perfect & original - an undercover informant working with FBI/Cops in crime underbelly has been repeatedly witnessed in cinema. But The Informant holds its own and is a refreshing return to a genre which is fast diminishing. Go for it - you won't be disappointed!",The Informer

Specially, Joel Kinnman played the perfect role as the lead performer. Other supporting actors were extremely good in making the movie the heart throbbing. From the start to the end, the movie maintained a good pace which made it interesting. At times, we could predict what might happen next but even then, the majority of the time, the movie had good twist.

As it sometime is, you have to comprimize. I'm sorry to say that they changed or left out some important stuff in the book, and the ending is as I remember totally different, and better in the book.
But it still a good movie good acting and not so much of the Hollywood action that can tend to be a little boring sometime.
