0,MartinHafer,"Despite a couple poorly written performances, an excellent film that is NOT exploitational or even a horror film",8,20 June 2007,"I liked this movie a heck of a lot more than I thought I would, as I had little interest in seeing a horror film (this just isn't a genre I enjoy most of the time). A lot of this was because the movie really wasn't a horror film per se, but a courtroom drama following the death of a supposedly possessed girl as well as a film that discusses the possibility of demonic possession--though this is handled in a pretty ambiguous way and with no easy or pat answers. I could see people who say demonic possession can be explained away by natural phenomena AND those who believe in its existence both enjoying this interesting and thought-provoking film. It probably won't offend religious people nor will like likely offend others--it's just a good film. It's even more interesting when you learn that the story is based on a real case, though artistic license was used in making this film (just how much, I don't know).Despite an excellent script, excellent acting by the actress playing ""Emily Rose"" and a real creepy mood, there is one problem with the film and that is the acting by BOTH the prosecuting and defense attorney in the film. The prosecutor seemed too wooden, angry and unprofessional to be real and I truly doubt if his histrionics in the courtroom would have been tolerated by a sane judge. Likewise, the defense attorney, at times, seemed rather dumb and presented nearly as poor a case at the prosecutor. Plus, the average person probably could have done a better job than they did! I really wonder if the writers ever consulted with real lawyers to find out how to create these roles--they just were not believable and tended to detract from the rest of the film. Still, despite this serious complaint, this IS a good film--though I really doubt if it's a good idea to let young kids see this due to the subject matter.Also, if you get a chance, see REQUIEM. This is a German-made version of the exact same case of Anneliese Michel--the inspiration for both stories. Both are very good but have a much different focus.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
1,Leofwine_draca,One of the freshest possession movies out there - B-movie producers take note!,7,9 July 2016,"It's been a while since we had a good exorcism movie – not counting that rubbishy EXORCIST sequel that came out a few years ago. When I heard about THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, I thought it sounded good – different enough to be worth a look. When I caught it on TV last night, I knew I'd been right. This takes the true-life case of a failed exorcism and turns it into a gripping John Grisham-style courtroom drama in a very intriguing, thought-provoking way.I'm a big believer in the supernatural and I've studied it a lot in the past. What is presented here is a very believable, very frightening account of demonic possession. I honestly believe that this really happened. Although the film is lengthy and slow-moving, it's never boring and that's because somebody had the great idea of including harrowing flashbacks of the possessed Emily during the courtroom case. It really works, breaking up the courtroom tension, and adding in genuine frights and chills along the way too.The movie is topped off with a fantastic cast working at the top of their game. I don't believe Laura Linney has ever been better than she has here, and her portrayal of a woman with integrity is fine. Tom Wilkinson makes us believe he is the disturbed priest with every drop of sweat that comes from him. As for Jennifer Carpenter, well she should be going places with her portrayal of the tormented Emily here, and I hope she doesn't suffer the same kind of career nosedive as Linda Blair did in the '80s.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
2,SnoopyStyle,Either 'Law & Order' or 'The Omen' but not both,6,6 March 2014,"Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) is a pretty regular girl who had a scholarship to leave her home. Then she dies and Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is brought up for charges after he performed an exorcism on the girl. Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) is brought in to defend the Father against her wishes. She's somewhat of an agnostic and doesn't believe in the Father. And then she starts having experiences.This is a courtroom drama trying to fit in some horror. The courtroom drama holds a little bit of interest, but the horror has no scares. It's done in flashbacks which we know what generally will happen. It's like trying to get into a ball game even though you know what the final score will be. It's hard to do. This could be a pretty good courtroom thriller, but it's too long and too disrupted by all the flashbacks that isn't scary. It's like it couldn't really decide if it wants to be 'Law & Order' or 'The Omen'. The good thing in the movie is the solid acting from Linney and Wilkinson. They elevate this movie.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
3,Hitchcoc,Doesn't Know Which Way to Go,8,24 April 2006,"I got talked into watching this and soon became quite captivated. It's really a courtroom drama, not a horror movie (granted there are scenes of suspense, and some of the possession stuff to pull it the other way). We are led along the way the jury is. There is no way they can ever be assured that this girl was possessed. They are asked to be a modern jury and listen to the evidence in the light of the legal system of which they are part. The script contains a lot of evidence of possession and demonic interference. The business with the Witching Hour of 3:00 A. M. Even the lawyer, Laura Linny, is confronted at that time. That's a bit of a red herring. Just about everything else comes in as testimony, but those incidents (the later killing of a doctor who had been at the scene) make us suspend disbelief and assume the priest indeed was facing demons. I finally got down to jurisprudence. The issue became, since everything is based on faith how can this man be let free. In a court of law he must be found guilty. But, how can a man of faith, who follows the letter of liturgical law and has the support of the diocese, be found guilty when he is following his vows. Every year we hear about children who die because their religions don't allow them to receive medical treatment. This is not new. The courts generally side with the innocent victim. In this film, the victim is an adult. An expert witness tells the court, he would have sedated Emily and force fed her nutrients to save her life. There's the rub. I was glad I got to see this film. The title turned me off. It taught me to search a little deeper before deciding what to watch and what to ignore.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
4,claudio_carvalho,Science vs. Religion,8,22 September 2006,"The nineteen years old Catholic college girl Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dies a couple of days after being submitted to an exorcism carried out by her parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson). Emily believed she was possessed by six demons, and although authorized by Emily and he parents, Father Moore is accused of negligent homicide, since he had suggested Emily to interrupt the use of medications for epilepsy. In order to avoid a scandal, the Archdiocese hires the successful, ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), and the prosecution assigns the religious prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott). Along the days, there is a battle between science and religion in the court.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was a great surprise for me. Based on a true event, I was expecting a horror movie like ""The Exorcist"", but actually it is a great story of trial, with the confrontation of science and religion, but with an agnostic lawyer defending and a religious one accusing a priest. The story is leaded by Erin, and her contact with the unknown and her final speech are some of the great moments of this film. Among the scariest parts are Dr. Cartwright (Duncan Fraser) saying that he started praying again since he had witnessed the exorcism, and when the priest explains that 3 AM is the demoniac witching hour. The direction of Scott Derrickson is excellent, using special effects only when necessary, and very well supported by a magnificent cast, leaded by the wonderful Laura Linney and the great Tom Wilkinson, followed by the unknown Jennifer Carpenter, who is great in the role of Emily Rose, Campbell Scott and Colm Feore. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Exorcismo de Emily Rose"" (""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"")",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
5,kosmasp,Do you believe in Horror?,7,10 July 2007,"Horror movies that is ... because the movie is based on the same story that the German movie ""Requiem"" is based on (same main person), but opts to go a different way, than the German movie did. Where the German movie opted for intellectual drama and a psychological study of a person (resulting in a movie that is very well acted and directed, but does not give you the option of a) being scared and b) make your mind up what you want to believe) ...Yes this movie here is a horror movie, with a judicially part, and so it will have a few (cheap?) scares. And yes it will have other flaws to. But instead of ""Requiem"" this one opts to entertain you, rather than give a cold analytical explanation of what might have happened. I know that although this sometimes does have a TV-movie of the week feeling, it does achieve what it aims for (kudos have to go out to the actors, making this believable) -> entertain! Nothing more, nothing less!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
6,lee_eisenberg,a worthy exorcise video,7,24 June 2006,"The title may make ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" sound like another cheap ""Exorcist"" rip-off; after all, there have been plenty of those. Even the reminder that the movie is based on a true story could seem like an excuse for the people behind the movie to feel good about themselves in case the whole thing came out crappy.Ah, but there is a major surprise in store for us. Don't get me wrong: there is a girl suspected by some of being possessed by the Devil. However, this is not the same thing as ""The Exorcist"". You see, in this case the girl died during the exorcism, and so the priest is on trial for negligent homicide. So, the movie focuses on the trial, and how it forces people to consider various possibilities of what happened.Demonic possession and a trial? Is that really possible in one movie? Not only is it, they do a very interesting job with it. I will say that some of the scenes sometimes seem a little silly, but they are also intense. You just might feel like you are getting possessed, even though the whole concept seems far-fetched. As for the trial scenes, they bring up the issue of what all one should consider when reviewing a case. Certainly demonic possession isn't something that we would usually count as a probability, given our understanding of mental illness and epilepsy. But is there any chance of it? The movie doesn't tell us what to think; if anything, it's something to think about, which is part of what makes the movie better than one would expect.As for the cast members, Laura Linney does a top-notch job as the defense attorney (which isn't surprising, given her performances in ""The Truman Show"", ""You Can Count On Me"" and ""Kinsey""). Tom Wilkinson is also quite good as the priest (also not surprising). Also starring are Campbell Scott, Colm Feore, Mary Beth Hurt, Henry Czerny and Shoreh Aghdashloo.So check it out. It just might save your life.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
7,jboothmillard,The Exorcism of Emily Rose,5,31 December 2008,"I thought this might be a bit like The Village, given three out of five stars, and turning out to be rubbish, but actually, not bad. Basically Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is on trial, charged with negligent homicide, after he performed an exorcism on 19-year-old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). He has hired successful, ambitious and agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), who has no belief in God, to defend, and prove that he was in fact trying to help her, and he did not cause her death (intentionally). The film is obviously told with a court case, and flashbacks to Emily suffering through her possession, apparently by six demons, and obviously Moore trying to help her. For a while, Erin is just doing her job and not sure what to believe, it is only when she encounters small spirit forces herself that she is determined to help him succeed. In the end, it seems that Father Moore is found guilty, but he is released anyway, for the reason that he has already served time. Also starring Campbell Scott as Ethan Thomas, Colm Feore as Karl Gunderson, Mary Beth Hurt as Judge Brewster, Henry Czerny as Dr. Briggs, Shohreh Aghdashloo as Dr. Adani, Joshua Close as Jason, Kenneth Welsh as Dr. Mueller, Duncan Fraser as Dr. Cartwright and J.R. Bourne as Ray. The scenes seeing the evil spirits speaking and acting through Emily is quite chilling, the court case story is interesting, and it is a thought-provoking story, it just isn't as good as The Exorcist, but try it for yourself. Worth watching!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
8,ma-cortes,Exciting and thrilling court drama with horror and exorcism,7,8 November 2006,"This is a thriller based on true and little known deeds referred to a narration of Ameliese Michael . A nineteen years young girl called Emily Rose(Jennifer Carpenter,¨the White chick¨)) dies later being submitted to an exorcism carried on by a parish priest(Tom Wilkinson).She was an ordinary girl until began the terrible demonic possessions and a harmful spirit which tortured her. Father Moore is charged with negligent homicide but he advised to interrupt the use of medications for the paranoia and epilepsy and he makes exorcism to save her.A famous and driven lawyer called Erin Bruner(Laura Linney)is hired to defend him and a successful,ambitious prosecutor(Campbell Scott)is assigned for the accusation ,besides of a resolute judge(Mary Beth Hurt).In the public hearing trial declare various doctors(Kenneth Welsh,Duncan Fraser) who explain their diverse point of view.It's a court film adding terror and thriller.This is a startling and terrifying story about possession with usual poltergeist phenomenon caused by demon.The events took place in 1976 but the excessive and prohibited cost decided make it in contemporary scenarios.The film provides great lots of grisly events,screams,eerie atmosphere that becomes pretty sinister when the supernatural possession happen.Flash-backs during trial from different perspectives of the exorcism stories create to spectator his own opinion about if it happened.The picture turns out to be very intense and exciting, concerning about the human fragility and human spirit that challenges the ordinary people ,developing a confrontation among faith and science.Casting is frankly well,Laura Linney(nominated to Oscar in 2000 by ¨You can count on me¨)is excellent;Tom Wilkinson(nominated to Oscar in 2001 by ¨In the room¨)is magnificent. Production design by David Brisbin and cinematography by Tom Stern based on Francis Bacon paintings such color as atmosphere,the colors are divided in several zones ,the orange represents the terror,the maroon the anger and the white the hope. The motion picture is well directed by Scott Derrickson making one the highest earning terror movie of the last years.As Emily predicted,her story has affected many people.Emily's gravesite has become an unofficial holy shrine which continues to draw visitors from all over the world.After the trial ,father Moore went into seclusion.Refusion to appeal his guilty conviction and stating :¨This is a matter for God : worldly courts cannot pass any judgement on it¨. Erin Brener shared her case files with an expert in medical research and anthropology whose further research and published work about the life and death of Emily Rose inspired this film.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
9,BA_Harrison,An unusual tale of demonic possession and legal wrangling.,6,19 February 2006,"This film is a strange conglomeration  part shock horror and part court drama  and whilst it is not a complete failure, it is too bizarre a concoction to be wholly successful.It succeeds best as an examination of theology and its significance in the legal process, and as a result will alienate the viewers who were expecting rotating heads and projectile vomiting. The courtroom scenes dissipate the horror, weakening its impact, and will leave hardcore horror fans nonplussed.The courtroom scenes, however, do manage to hold the viewers attention throughout the running time. The script raises interesting questions about religious faith and its relevance within the legal system. All involved give solid performances, and, whilst not exactly edge-of-your-seat material, the drama plays out in an interesting enough fashion to keep most viewers from reaching for the off switch.Likewise, the horror elements, whilst not exactly revolutionary (think 'watered down The Exorcist meets The Omen'), are effective enough, given that this is not meant to be an out-and-out gorefest. Jennifer Carpenter, as Emily Rose, gives Linda Blair a run for her money as she grimaces, contorts herself and speaks in tongues for all her worth.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an enjoyable, if unremarkable, affair which should be lauded, if only for trying a different approach to a well-worn theme.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
10,moonspinner55,Validating demonic possession in a court of law,1,18 August 2016,"College freshman, a scholarship student living in the campus dorm, dies after being treated for epileptic-like seizures and violent self-inflicted behavior not medically but spiritually, by a priest who believed she was possessed by a demon and who now stands trial for her death. An awful lot of very talented people worked on this baleful freak-show, all to no avail. Written by Scott Derrickson, who also directed, and Paul Harris Boardman, the story is loosely based on an incident that occurred in Germany, but the usual horror movie clichés are intact: a door opening and closing in a storm, 'scary' shots of feet walking down corridors (to heighten suspense), a pencil case moving by itself, squeaky floors in nearly every house, Emily Rose freaking out during a test in the classroom (complete with a stormy sky outside), the unfortunate girl eating spiders (like Renfield in ""Dracula""), as well as a defense lawyer who is 17 minutes late to court because a demonic force shut off her electricity! Embarrassingly silly and derivative stuff that an earlier generation would have roundly dismissed as garbage, yet audiences in 2005 went for it. NO STARS from ****",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
11,blanche-2,a well-made film in the horror/supernatural genre,6,18 October 2013,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" from 2005 isn't your normal Exorcist ripoff, made on the cheap. It has a very high-quality cast which includes Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson - you can't get any better than those two - as well as Jennifer Carpenter, who went on to success in Dexter, Campbell Scott of ""Royal Pains,"" and as an added bonus, Colm Feore as Linney's boss. Feore is one of the best actors around, and I have been privileged to see him perform Shakespeare at Stratford in Canada. His presence also tells me that this film was made primarily in Canada.Against her wishes, attorney Erin Bruner (Linney), just coming down from a high profile case, is asked to take the case of a priest (Wilkinson) going on trial for the negligent homicide of one of his parishioners, a young woman named Emily Rose (Carpenter). He performed an exorcism on her which failed; she died a horrible death, off of the medication prescribed by a doctor who believed she had epilepsy.Bruner, an agnostic, finds out that defending the priest is not going to be easy; the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a barracuda, and no one thinks what the priest is saying is true.That's all I can say about the plot. Carpenter, as the possessed girl, gives a powerful performance, and Linney and Wilkinson are as well, though they don't have flamboyant roles. They have solid support from the rest of the cast.Normally this type of film doesn't interest me, but it's hard to resist anything with Wilkinson or Linney in it.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
12,Coventry,Court-horror!,8,14 November 2005,"Ironically enough, ""The Excorcism of Emily Rose"" got released in my country (Belgium) synchronously with another similar, real-life lawsuit. A self-acclaimed exorcist has to justify the death of a young girl after performing inhuman rituals and fatal exorcism tricks. It's weird having seen this movie and then follow the lawsuit on TV and in newspapers. It's so easy to deny the existence of demonic possession and to brush aside exorcism as quackery, but then  as this film shows  you're also questioning people's beliefs and family values. Emily Rose is the sympathetic daughter of a poor but deeply religious rural family. Shortly after her long-anticipated start at the university, her body becomes the host of no less than 6 different demons. The priest of the little town where she lives, father Moore, is doing everything he can to purify Emily's body but the demons are too strong and she doesn't survive the exorcism. What makes this film different than the obvious 70's classic ""The Exorcist"" (which also entirely revolves on the possession of an innocent girl) is that the story takes place after the actual exorcism and in the courtroom where father Moore is on trial for negligent homicide. His ambitious lawyer Erin Bruner goes straight for the acquittal of her client, but father Moore only cares for telling Emily's story, despite the fact that this can cost him his career as a priest. The screenplay of this film was based on a true story and director Scott Derrickson does a great job in making the extended courtroom sequences interesting and compelling. The flashbacks, showing Emily's horrible decrepit, are very atmospheric and contain multiple shock-moments. The acting is sublime, with a powerful Tom Wilkinson as the devoted priest and an enchanting Jennifer Carpenter as the poor Emily Rose. This is not a full-blooded horror film, but definitely one of the most unsettling, disturbing and thought-provoking dramas of the last few years. Highly recommended!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
13,michaelRokeefe,Religious procedure goes wrong.,4,7 January 2006,"Based on a true story. Not very scary, but haunting. An average young college student Emily Rose(Jennifer Carpenter)begins seeing strange visions, speaking in unrecognizable tongues, succumbing to horrid body contortions and mutilations of her body. She was thought to be a victim of epilepsy or psychosis. Her priest, Father Moore(Tom Wilkinson)believes she is a subject of demon possession. Father Moore is requested by the family to perform an exorcism to rid Emily of her torment. Emily does not survive and the priest is charged with negligent homicide. An ambitious, admitted agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner(Laura Linney)takes on Father Moore's defense. The finale contains an unexpected twist. It was nice to not see it coming. Cast also includes: Campbell Scott, Colm Feore and Ken Welsh.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
14,hitchcockthelegend,Demons exist whether you believe in them or not; even in the court room.,7,26 August 2010,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is directed by Scott Derrickson. It's loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel and follows the trial of a priest who is charged with negligent homicide when Emily Rose dies after he performs an exorcism believing her to be possessed with demons. It stars Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, Colm Feore & Jennifer Carpenter.Poor Emily Rose (Carpenter excellent), was she possessed by demons, or was her terrifying behaviour the result of an epileptic condition untreatable by the drugs prescribed her? That's the core of the movie, something that now, some time after the dust and expectation of an outright horror has settled, makes for a far better viewing experience than that which many watchers got on its release. Emly Rose is first and foremost a court room drama about horrific events. As a horror film it's only scary in small doses (tho what we get is terrific stuff and pops the old goose flesh right up), but as a court room drama it triumphs; chiefly because the makers are not coming down on any one side. Derrickson co-wrote the screenplay with Paul Harris Boardman, and as noted on the DVD commentary, one is a believer of the supernatural, the other a sceptic, and this shows in the writing. Thus the film is cleverly ambiguous about where it will end. Yes there's a bit of hokey in there, and for sure we could have done with a bit more terror laid on Linney's (professional and sexy) agnostic lawyer as things start to go bump in the night for her. But this is a well balanced and intelligent movie regardless. 7/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is accused of letting Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) die during an exorcism. Doctors said she was epileptic but she and Moore thought she was possessed. Lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) is hired to defend him. She doesn't really believe demons possessed Emily...but then strange things start to happen to her. Is it coincidence or not? And will she convince the jury to find Moore innocent?This movie is far from perfect. It's a little too long and Campbell Scott is surprisingly bad in his role...but this movie works. It's serious and well-made and it keeps things on a somewhat believable level. The things that Rose does COULD be caused by psychotic behaviour...but maybe not. The audience is provided with both sides of the argument. This movie really doesn't provide any answers but it brings up some fascinating questions about faith, religion and mental illness.Except for Scott the acting is great across the board but Linney and Wilkinson carry this movie. The two of them are believable from the very beginning. Also it's well-directed and there are only a few of those stupid ""jump"" scares with the sound blaring out for no good reason other than to make the audience jump.

16,LeonLouisRicci,Definitely Different Demoniac Drama,8,22 November 2013,"Does the Film make the Case for Demonic Possession? Well No. Does the Film make the Case for ""it's only Mental Illness""? Well No. That's the Point of this Hybrid Movie that takes the Horror Movie Staple and moves it into the Courtroom. A Never Happens if Very Very Rare Occurrence in Real Life. But it did Happen in this Real Life Murder Trial.Matters of Faith or the Paranormal just Cannot Comfortably Conform to Whole Truths and Nothing but the Truth Legal Definitions. By Their Nature They are Subject to the Vagaries of the Unprovable.So do not Expect a Conventional Scarefest, although there are Plenty of Such Things to Behold in this Daring Drama. Forget the Inconsistencies of the Adherence to the Actual Facts of the ""Based on a true story"" Tagline, and just Settle in for some Intellectual Intrigue and Back and Forth Arguments about ""Possibilities"".Entertaining all the way, this is a Well Acted Movie.

17,poolandrews,I really hated this.,2,30 December 2008,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose starts on a rural US farm where a county medical examiner (Terence Kelly) pronounces nineteen year old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dead & says he can't be sure that she died of natural causes. After examining the evidence about how Emily died shortly after an exorcism performed by Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) the district attorney (Julian Christopher) decides to charge him with negligent manslaughter. Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) handles the prosecution while ambitious attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) is assigned to to the defence but she has her work cut out as the prosecution calls in numerous doctors & scientists saying that Emily needed proper medical treatment & that her supposed possession was down to epileptic fits & psychosis. Bruner feels her only chance of success is not to disprove the strong medical evidence but to prove demonic possession & that therefore an exorcism was the only thing that could have saved Emily.Co-written & directed by Scott Derrickson I have to say that I hated The Exorcism of Emily Rose with a passion, there are films which just rub you up the wrong way & almost make you want to hate them from the story to the character's to the pacing to the production values & The Exorcism of Emily Rose definitely falls into that category for me. Right, to begin with anyone who goes into The Exorcism of Emily Rose expecting a straight horror film rip-off of The Exorcist (1973) will be sorely disappointed, this plays more like the dullest & most boring episode of L.A. Law (1986 - 1994) you could possibly imagine. So basically what we have here is a courtroom drama & supernatural horror film mix of The Exorcist & L.A. Law, doesn't that just sound wonderful? To cut straight to the chase The Exorcism of Emily Rose fails miserably as both courtroom drama & horror in my opinion, the horror is lifted directly from The Exorcist with a teenage girl possessed by an evil demonic spirit, she is tied to her bed while the exorcism is performed, there's the bodily contortions & she even speaks in an ancient language she couldn't possibly know. Trust me you've seen it all before. Then there's the courtroom angle which is no better, a courtroom drama succeeds on it's twists & turns but here there are none with very linear flashbacks that support only the defence & make it all to clear what happened. There doesn't seem to be any middle or opposing ground. Where's the opposing viewpoint of the prosecution? The film leaves one in no doubt about what happened & that it tries to suggest possession is real & the whole message about opening up to other possibilities besides scientific ones has been done before & isn't anything new. Then there are the character's, Emily is barely seen & we never get to know her, her family aren't even given names, Father Moore is underdeveloped & Erin Bruner is just such an unlikable character I wanted to kick my telly whenever she appeared.A lot has been made of the fact that The Exorcism of Emily Rose was based on a true story, that of a young German girl named Annelises Michel in 1976 (suspiciously not long after the original The Exorcist was released...) who also died because of neglect after an exorcism. This film & that case have little in common, the country the story takes place in is different, there's almost thirty years difference in the setting & every single name has been changed. The makers didn't exactly go for accuracy did they? The outcome of the case has also been changed, here in the film there's a terrible 'happy Hollywood ending' in which Father Moore is freed & just made me want to vomit really. The scares are none existent although I did like the fact the makers kept the use of CGI computer effects down to a minimum, there's nothing in the way of blood or gore either & the majority of the films slow two hour duration is set in the courtroom.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this was a surprise hit at the box-office, obviously the vast majority of people being sold on the true story & horror aspects of it both of which are awful. I thought the acting was pretty poor & in particular in my opinion Laura Linney was absolutely awful.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is maybe the worst big Hollywood studio film that I have seen in the past few years, hell I'd rather watch Blackwater Valley Exorcism (2006) again than watch this. Thank God I saw it on telly for free & didn't waste any money on it.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
18,dbborroughs,Okay horror story left me feeling used and abused,5,22 September 2005,"This is more a record of my feeling than a review.Based on a case in Germany Emily Rose tells the story of a priest charged with the death of a young girl during a exorcism. Its well acted and has some genuinely creepy moments. Unfortunately the film made me feel used and abused by the end. There is something about this film that made it an unpleasant experience for me. From the first frame this movie seemed to reach out and grab me with the intention of making me feel afraid. It didn't welcome me in it grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and forced me to see creepy images with a zeal that seemed somehow misplaced or as if it were an excited child that has just discovered some great secret and won't leave you alone until you agree. I felt it was saying ""see. See. This is creepy. Feel frightened. You have to be scared because this is creepy stuff"" It went on like this for the whole movie with the film insisting on making me feel frightened instead of allowing me to become that way on my own. I felt abused by the film.Its an okay film but way too insistent for my taste.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
19,Bunuel1976,The Exorcism Of Emily Rose ***,7,23 February 2006,"A very effective and surprisingly compelling 'horror' film with a unique 'courtroom-drama' framework, in which the uniformly excellent performances propel somewhat familiar (if still frightening) events. While THE EXORCIST (1973) remains the ultimate in 'possession' films, this entry (little publicized when it emerged) certainly gives it a run for its money by providing a balancing act of solid scares (some of which, admittedly, are not very subtle) and spirituality. Perhaps the most disturbing element of this fact-based story is that, unlike THE EXORCIST, the victim is conscious of the possession and is even allowed to lapse, momentarily, into her normal self - but equally disquieting is the fact that the female attorney defending the Priest (accused of the possessed girl's death shortly after the exorcism rite failed!) is herself 'attacked' by the Forces of Evil during the course of the trial!! Among the most effective scenes in the film are the first manifestation of Evil in the girl's dormitory room (in which she manages to fight the 'demons'), the girl escaping the benign influence of the Priest by flying through the window in the initial stages of the exorcism, and the intense sequence detailing the failed rite itself (set inside a barn!).",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
20,zardoz-13,A Tial that's a Tribulation to Watch.,4,19 June 2007,"Any movie that uses the word 'exorcism' in its title invites inevitable comparison with director William Friedkin's nightmarish nail-biter ""The Exorcist"" (1973) starring Linda Blair as the demon-possessed daughter and Ellen Burstyn as her frantic mother. Aside from its heroine bedeviled by Lucifer and its sympathetic Catholic priest hero, the new courtroom drama & horror epic ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" (** out of ****) shares little in common with one of the scariest sagas of the 20th century. Anybody yearning for hair-raising yikes in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" should be prepared to be extremely disappointed. Writer & director Scott Derrickson and co-scribe Paul Harris Boardman, who collaborated on the enjoyable straight-to-video sequel ""Hellraiser 5: Inferno"" (2000) with Craig Sheffer, waste too much time in the well-lit courtroom scenes but not enough in the dimly lit exorcism scenes. Indeed, Derrickson stages most of the action outside the courtroom in dark, sinister places, but nothing leaps out to rattle your senses. Of course, Derrickson relies on standard horror movies clichés like doors slamming suddenly or furniture behaving as if it had a mind of its own to the accompaniment of composer Christopher Young's atmospheric but overwrought musical score. Ace lenser Tom Stern provides "" Emily Rose"" with some suitably creepy imagery, but his visually arresting photography and Young's forceful music cannot salvage this dignified but dull potboiler. Good Catholics may find the message of ""Emily Rose"" reassuring, and the Catholic Church doesn't take the beating here that it took in ""The Exorcist."" Nevertheless, thrill-seekers who swear by blood, gore and more will leave feeling cheated and betrayed by its ""Emily Rose's"" shortage of scary scenes and its off-beat, anti-climactic ending.""The Exorcism of ""Emily Rose"" opens after the fact. Emily (Jennifer Carpenter of ""White Chicks"") lays dead, and the authorities have charged Father Moore (Oscar winning British actor Tom Wilkinson of ""The Patriot"") with her death. Not only does Father Moore reject a plea bargain with the District Attorney for a six year prison sentence instead of a twelve year stretch, but also he demands repeatedly to tell Emily's story. The D.A. assigns Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott of ""Dying Young"") to prosecute. They want Thomas not only because he is a hard-hitting prosecutor but also he is a devout Methodist. Meanwhile, top-notch attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney of ""Mystic River""), who has earned a reputation by representing Johnny Cochrane style clients, makes a deal with her stuffy boss Karl Gunderson (Colm Feore of ""Pearl Harbor"") to handle Moore's defense on one condition. Erin wants in as a partner in his law firm if she wins the case. In an obvious effort to contrast Erin with her distinguished, grey-haired, icy-voiced courtroom opponent, the filmmakers have made Erin an agnostic who gulps martinis, curls up late at night with thick legal tomes, and prefers to sleep single in a double bed. Gunderson accepts Erin's demands. However, he warns her that the local archdiocese, which is footing the bill for the priest's defense, doesn't want Moore to testify. These Catholic Church leaders fear that Moore's eyewitness testimony will expose them to ridicule. Dramatically, Moore refuses to remain silent. Once ""Emily Rose"" introduces us to its gallery of characters, the movie sinks to the most basic level. Everything we learn comes from the lowest common denominator Q & A session that the jury, as well as we, must suffer through in this long-winded, 114-minute hokum. Occasionally, we see a spark of lifeor perhaps horrorwhen the film plunges us into eerie flashbacks. The ads for ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" say that the movie is 'based on a true story.' Just to give you an idea how drastically Hollywood has altered the facts, consider these changes. First, the heroine was originally a German lass named Anneliese Michel, not an American college freshman called Emily Rose. Second, this disastrous exorcism took place nearly thirty years ago in 1976. Incidentally, a fact that the filmmakers ignore is that this event constituted the last official exorcism that the Catholic Church sanctioned. Third, not only was the priest who performed the exorcism put on trial, but also the priest that assisted him as well as the girl's parents found themselves in court facing charges of negligent manslaughter. In the Hollywood version, neither Emily Rose's family nor the attending physician were arrested and charged with her Emily's demise. While Hollywood is notorious for s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g the truth, the people who made ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" appear to have taken a lot of liberties with the subject matter. When director Scott Derrickson and co-scribe Paul Harris Boardman aren't taking liberties with the facts, they seem determined to bore the Hades out of us with a lot of loquacious courtroom chatter. Imagine what ""The Exorcist"" might have been like had Perry Mason shown up instead of Father Merrin, and you'll have a good idea what happens. ""Emily Rose"" shuns sensationalism and undermines its own suspense. We know from the outset that the title character is kaput, and nothing that anybody can do will resurrect her. Moreover, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" dredges up the age-old faith versus facts argument between religious believers and non-believers. Religious convictions derive their power from spiritual faith, not scientific facts. Nevertheless, Derrickson and Boardman advocate the idea that mankind has grown too narrow-minded and negative about spiritual beliefs and wrong-headed when it relies on science alone to account for life's inexplicable episodes. Sadly, the verdict that the jury delivers supports science more than theology. The demons that occupy Emily Rose would make the demons in ""Ghostbusters"" howl with glee. During the trial, Erin faith in agnosticism takes a beating, and she finds herself changing teams before it's over. ""Van Helsing"" make-up artist Keith Vanderlaan seems to rely entirely on mascara to create the demons that haunt our heroine. Ultimately, despite its well-meaning objectives and a fine, first-rate cast, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" ranks as a trial that's a tribulation to watch.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The attorney assigned to defend him as portrayed by Linney has her hands full when exorcism is the basis for the defense. The idea to prolong the courtroom drama instead of the pyrotechniques of a good old fashioned horror movie may be commendable but it is ultimately boring in spite of an original concept that just wasn't fleshed out properly in the screenplay by Paul Harris Boardman and filmmaker Scott Derickson who ekes out a few good chills sporadically.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
22,view_and_review,Is she possessed or is she not?,8,22 February 2007,"This movie rivaled the 1975 classic, ""The Exorcist"". This movie was wonderfully done. It was eerie, chilling, and gripping. It was brilliant how the story brought forth doubt as to whether Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) was possessed or just going through a bad psychotic episode. While a Priest was battling a prosecutor in court to defend his actions, the movie took you through the battle that Emily Rose had gone through. Emily had gone through a terrible ordeal regardless of what side of the fence you stood on. The director did an excellent job of displaying just how spooky Emily was when she was suddenly shown in impossible contorted positions with blackened eyes. Plus, the physical feats Emily performed were just beyond human ability with a remote chance of plausibility to lend credence to any doubters. Ultimately, you can tell that the writer leaned towards the fact that she was possessed. This movie was incredible. I braved the entire movie, and while it had me suspended, it also had me wriggling and uneasy the entire time. This is probably the best movie of its kind since ""The Exorcist"".",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It is essentially a courtroom drama, laced with lots of interpersonal drama, and with Emily Rose's story told in evidence - effectively flashbacks.Based on a true story (a little research leads one to insert the words ""very loosely"" before ""based""), this is a gripping and involving drama, posing some interesting questions. And not answering them. It features strong performances from Tom Wilkinson as the priest and Laura Linney as his attorney. And it features a performance of extraordinary physicality from Jennifer Carpenter. Apart from make-up and, perhaps, a little help on the sound side, her vocal and contortionist abilities enhance her acting immeasurably.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
24,ferguson-6,Is it Possible?,6,11 September 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. Nothing is more frightening than that which we don't understand and hope doesn't exist. Nothing, that is, until you combine it with a true story. This is no slasher in the vein of ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", it is comes across much more as an update version of ""The Exorcist"", which caused many sleepless nights upon its release in the 1970's.Somehow, Scott Derrickson was selected to direct this. Derrickson has very little on the resume, but does a fine job most of the time in creating the necessary tension and illusions to keep the story moving forward. The film is based in a courtroom with the testimony handled mostly through flashbacks of the actual possession and attempted exorcism. The only real time in the film is the trial and a bit leading up to it and the ending.The multi-talented Laura Linney looks very nice as the defense attorney assigned against her will to the case. She pulls off the ladder climber, hot-shot lawyer persona and handles the courtroom scenes very well. Veteran Tom Wilkinson is solid as the on trial priest who performed the exorcism. Relative newcomer Jennifer Carpenter is harrowing in her scenes as Emily. Campbell Scott cranks out another fine performance as the steely-eyed hard-ass prosecuting attorney. His arrogance and irritation with the whole process come across as quite believable. Also nice to see Mary Beth Hurt on screen as the judge.Overall, this is a pretty intense re-telling and dramatization of the facts of the case. I do wish at least one scene had real life lighting, but instead Derrickson was consistent with his vision of near darkness throughout. Can't believe any normal person would have continued to sleep alone in Linney's apartment after all the strange happenings at 3:00 am.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Film deals with the trial surrounding Emily's death after an exorcism goes wrong. Tom Wilkinson plays a Priest on trial and Laura Linney plays the lawyer representing him. Starts out well introducing the trial and flashbacks of Emily going to college then it becomes episodic with her strange reactions to spiritual forces. The audience mostly laughed at its idiotic attempt to scare us and involve us in a boring courtroom drama. Director Scott Derrickson does his best using lighting to setup potential suspense but acting is minimal. Linney fares well as the attorney who also feels the spiritual forces inhabiting her life. Unfortunately Wilkinson is surprisingly weak and unconvincing as the Priest. Campbell Scott also stars although it isn't likely that it will be shown on any career achievement. Jennifer Carpenter overact as Emily in a performance that can best described as half paranoid and half constipated. Colm Feore also appears and reminds us that to see him in a great film, one only has to watch the awesome Bon Cop Bad Cop.

The film is really split into two halves here with this one being basically helped greatly by its really good possession and shock scenes. The opening scene that sets her up to becoming possessed is one of it's best sequences, as the long hallway and the unearthly voices floating around give it an unearthly feel while the first scene in the classroom where she sees a demonic face appearing in the window through a cloud of mist and turns around to see a student's face turn into a distorted demon's face giving off an unearthly roar makes it quite shocking. Running out into the rain and seeing more demonic faces give off the same unearthly roar is a bit clichéd, but it still helps to sell the mood while the finale in the church giving this a quite creepy conclusion. The different manners of how she's become afflicted are quite memorable moments with the frenzied bug-eating, speaking in tongues or just contorting her body into such impossible positions that it really becomes obvious something is wrong with her, and the long, suspenseful and chilling exorcism is the film's selling point, coming off with any number of creepy ideas and scenes in such a drawn-out style is one of the best scenes in the film. Otherwise, beyond the shocks and the exorcism, there isn't much else to like about it. Therefore, everything else in it doesn't really work which is only relegated to the courtroom battle drama. It's marketed as being a supernatural possession film, and the best moments come from those scenes, but the fact that the majority of the film is a courtroom battle with the supernatural elements coming in the form of flashbacks is a real misstep and is likely to confuse those coming in expecting the other kind of film. It's not that they're boring or anything, it's just that it's out of nowhere that it becomes that way, and it can be a disappointment. The fact that these are slow and really long don't help matters, extending this out far longer than it should. This could've easily been an hour and a half, or maybe a little longer, but the two hours running time forces it to keep the courtroom antics going for no reason other than to extend the running time. A few extraneous scenes could've been snipped as well, including the introductory scenes at the bar that repeat information we already know and also keep the running time going, and most of the time simply elicit a feeling of wanting to move along and get to the good scenes. These really harm the film.Rated PG-13: Language, Mild Violence and intense demonic and spiritual themes.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
27,Wuchakk,Scares the hell out of ya,9,17 December 2011,"In an age when most ""horror"" films belong in the comedy section, I can think of only a couple films in the last five years that seriously horrified me. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of them.THE PLOT: The movie is based on the actual story of a German girl who died while being exorcised in the late 1970s. The priest was then put on trial for neglectful homicide. Google it for details.Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) plays an agnostic who defends the priest (Tom Wilkinson), the prosecutor (Campbell Scott) is a believer. This creates some problems: How can an unbeliever defend a believer who performs a service that apparently kills the young woman? How can a believer come against another believer who was simply trying to deliver the girl from spiritual malevolence? The prosecutor makes the case that the woman was ill with various mental disorders and that the exorcism was just a bunch of superstitious mumbo jumbo. By contrast, Erin Bruner argues that these illnesses were the RESULT OF possession -- that the girl's possession brought on the symptoms. This makes sense in light of the scriptural evidence of Jesus Christ delivering people from evil spirits who induced insanity, muteness and deafness.Another important argument of the defense is that a potent drug that Emily was prescribed trapped her in a mode that was resistant to the exorcism.The fascinating story provokes many questions. We need to take an honest look at our mental health practices and institutions. Although there are some genuinely good people working in this field who care about the patients, it seems that the best we can do is drug people and make them, more or less, numbed-up living zombies or even mindless vegetables. Unfortunately this is how they're damned to live the rest of their lives, subservient and dependent on the mental health establishment (that actually needs them to stay ill in order to exist).Such people don't need more drugs and ""therapy."" What they need is delivered. They need delivered from evil spiritual powers that have possessed them. They need FREED. Don't mistake me here, I'm not against mental health people or facilities because I realize they're just doing what they know to do. It's just not working. Again, the mentally ill need delivered not force-fed more drugs and essentially locked-up for the rest of their lives. That's not life, it's living death! Of course, releasing a horde of religious wackos into our mental institutions isn't the answer. Yet, what if some believers who walked in the boldness and authority of Jesus Christ were available, people who show documented evidence of DELIVERING the mentally ill? The New Testament relays case after case of Jesus Christ exorcising demons from hundreds of people, maybe thousands. He didn't numb 'em up and sentence them to a life of living death. Rather he came to set the prisoners free from darkness, heal the sick and heal the brokenhearted! If there are people out there who walk in this same anointing of power and freedom, shouldn't we allow them to minister to our mentally ill? Unfortunately a large percentage of the church is very weak in regards to spiritual deliverance. Except for offering eternal salvation, their gospel is powerless and next to worthless. Yet this wasn't the way of the early church. Paul, Peter and others offered total deliverance. Thankfully, there are still a remnant of these types of believers and these are the ones who can help our mentally ill, as long as the oppressed WANT freedom, healing and deliverance (since some WANT to stay dependent and ""cared for"").I'm only raising such moral/theological/philosophical questions because the film provokes it, so please don't be irked at me for getting all heavy and theological.Despite the numerous courtroom scenes there are certainly enough horrifying elements in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" to please most horror fans, just don't expect Freddy or Jason shenanigans. Like my title blurb points out, this film will literally scare the hell out of you.Interestingly, while it's horrifying ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is also somehow warm and faith-affirming, even sometimes beautiful.My only criticism is a theological theory introduced late in the movie. This theory is incredible wrong. I won't elaborate except to say that God would never allow the option of Emily's possession as a supposed testimony to the world of the existence of dark spiritual powers, rather His purpose is always to deliver such people, which not only testifies to the existence of the malevolent powers but, more importantly, sets the person FREE and gives glory to God.The film runs 119 (the unrated version 122 minutes) and was shot in Vancouver, BC.

28,gradyharp,Possibilities: The Struggle Between Science and Faith,10,24 December 2005,"The timing of this film could not be more propitious as the courts struggle with Darwinism, Creationism, and separation of church and state, creating embittered conversations about fact versus faith. The fact that this film adaptation of an actual event results in a work of such touching tenderness is due to the imagination and artistry of writer Paul Harris Boardman and co-writer and director Scott Derrickson, as well as a fine cast of some of our best actors. This is not a horror flick: this is a thinking person's film that has the courage to discuss the possibilities of things on one can explain.Father Moore (a brilliant Tom Wilkinson) is a priest being tried for negligent homicide in the death of a young college student Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a parishioner who sought his help feeling she was possessed by demons. The archdiocese hires pragmatic, agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney in another superlative role) to defend Father Moore. The prosecuting attorney is strongly religious Methodist Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott in an atypical role well realized). The film is basically a courtroom drama: the polar sides being scientific (medical) facts versus spiritually based possibilities and the writing for both lawyers is bitingly incisive. Mixed into the testimony and preparation for the trial are flashbacks to the events leading up to Emily's death, including the gradual possession of Emily's body by six demons and her reaction to the possession, and the exorcism performed by Father Moore. The priest does not fear jail or loss of clerical collar: his only concern is that he be able to tell Emily's shared story, a story that raises more questions in everybody's minds than providing legal results of the trial.Laura Linney is extraordinary as the agnostic hardened lawyer whose very being is shaken by the case which she tries. The nuances of her character are so well conveyed that we come to understand the un-understandable as she sees it. Likewise Tom Wilkinson and Campbell Scott shine, as do all of the minor characters. The cinematography of Tom Stern is among the most artful of the year and the musical score by Christopher Young is intensely atmospheric. This is not yet another in the endless line of horror flicks, though the Para scientific manifestations of demon possession are graphically enacted (not my cup of tea but necessary for the story). This is a much more important story than that and one that would be helpful in aiding understanding if both agnostics/pragmatists and spiritual people watched and listened. Grady Harp",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
29,The_Void,Intriguing horror drama,6,25 November 2005,"Based on a true story, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is quite a different breed of horror film from what modern film fans are used to. Rather than concentrating on shocks and scares, the film puts the focus squarely on the mystery surrounding the plot; and it does so by setting the majority of the action in a courtroom setting. The result is a movie that's not a full-blown horror film, but rather a mixture of courtroom drama and horror elements. Modern horror cinema really needs all the innovation it can get, and the fact that this story is handled in such a way makes it both original, and interesting; and so I don't hesitate to label The Exorcism of Emily Rose as one of the best horror films so far this decade. The plot follows the arrest of Father Moore for negligent homicide regarding the death of Emily Rose. Doctors diagnosed her with epilepsy, but the Reverend saw Emily's condition as something more, and so advised her to stop taking her medication and have an exorcism performed instead...on his case is ace-lawyer Erin Bruner, who wants to win the case as much as Father Moore wants Emily's story told.The debate between religion and science has gone on for centuries, and it's that same debate that makes this film so fascinating. The court room battle between the priest and the doctors fits snugly into that debate; and the way that the film presents the facts and almost lets the audience make their own mind up ensures that the film gets you thinking. The performances are truly first rate, with an excellent Tom Wilkinson impressing in the role of Father Moore, while Laura Linney does the strong woman thing that she's got so good at; and Jennifer Carpenter brings Emily Rose to life. The obvious film to compare this one to is the seventies classic 'The Exorcist'; but apart from the two films having the same ritual in the title, they really aren't similar. The Exorcist was a more gratuitous, personal tale; while this one is mystery on a much bigger scale. They do both, however, have excellent exorcism scenes; the one here being the best part of the movie, and really making the adrenaline flow. On the whole, ignore all who say bad things about this movie. It's not masterpiece like it's seventies counterpart; but it's definitely one of the best horror films this decade, and will impress all the right people.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
30,zetes,The most offensive movie of 2005,3,5 August 2006,"If not the most poorly made film of the year, it is indeed the most insulting, offensive, idiotic and just plain evil film of the year. It is, in fact, the absolute worst movie of 2005. What makes this one particularly sting is that I was completely familiar with the true story it is based on, that of the German woman Anneliese Michel. I have or have had an interest in the occult, demonic possessions included. Not that I believe in it, but I do find stories of it interesting and often very frightening. I read of Michel's case years ago, and it's a chilling one. It is also one of the complete failure of religion which, as an atheist, delights me, I must admit. What really happened is that two priests began performing an exorcism on Anneliese. They didn't bother to care for her physically and eventually starved her to death. As a result, the Roman Catholic Church required that a physician be present at any future exorcisms that they might sanction. In Emily Rose, which moves the story to America, the priest who is accused of letting the possessed girl die is conveniently already given a doctor to observe the ceremony. It's even specifically mentioned that this is Church doctrine. This fact doesn't come into trial right away (which doesn't make any sense). Anyway, we're pretty much told right off the bat that the priest (played by Tom Wilkinson) is completely guiltless. There's never any doubt, and no ambiguity whatsoever. The only reason he wants to go to trial is so that he can ""tell Emily's story"", as he says about twenty times. And her story, as written by the girl herself, is that she died because the Virgin Mary, whom she saw in a vision, told her she had to so that the people would realize that the spiritual elements of life do in fact exist. So God lets demons take over an innocent girl's soul so that more people would believe in Him. It's Job all over again. The film ends with updates that treat the story as if it happened the way the idiots here have told it, informing us that Emily's story helped people to believe in God. One wonders why it wouldn't do the exact opposite.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
31,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Exorcism of Emily Rose,8,5 November 2005,"After watching this movie, I feel compelled to correct what the marketing folks did, promoting it like an outright horror movie with plenty of ""BOO"" moments, and not an inclination that a major portion of this film takes place in a courtroom. I believe the trailer does not even hint at this having courtroom drama-mama moments, to which many in the audience that I watched this with, went ""bor-ring"", ""dull"", and disappointed many horny teenage boyfriends who thought they could eat tofu with each frightening scene.May I again repeat that this movie does not have plenty of moments which will make you jump, or your heart race. Neither should you associate this film with the kind of expectation from the superb The Exorcist - this film treats the ritual with some respect and doesn't sensationalize it, nor have any kinky spirits to possess the poor victim with abilities to walk backwards down a staircase, or find creative and vulgar uses for the crucifix.What this movie is, it's based on a true story (of course names, etc have been changed, but the premise kept intact) of a priest being hauled to court to stand trial in the 70s, having being accused of causing the death of a young girl through neglect. It's a tussle between science and faith as both defense and prosecution bring forth their theories about the events leading to the faithful night of the exorcism.Therefore, the act of casting spirits back to where they come from, is told only in flashbacks, and at times, with the scientific point of view in mind to debunk spiritualism. The narrative works for a courtroom movie, not so for a horror film. Perhaps the talking point in the movie, is the debate on the need to create a villain, in order for the hero to be a hero. It's similar to the theme that M Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable, and John Woo's MI:2 touched upon. I'm neither religious or spiritual, and this film, like Constantine, drives home the point that it doesn't matter whether you believe in ""them"" - they believe in you / they are around.Laura Linney shines in her role as the lawyer who took on the case as it's publicity and promotional opportunity, and Tom Wilkinson is believable as the Father who dared to challenge Evil in the face. However, kudos must go to relative newcomer Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose, in highlighting the fear and pain that her character goes through. And ooh, the body contortions will just freak you out, and what surprised me was the unusual possession she experienced.I know that there'll be a group in the audience who'll give the thumbs up if John Constantine bursts into the scene and bitch-slaps the devil out of Emily Rose, in order to speed up the pace, but to such horror-action lovers, this will not be your cup of tea. The pacing is somehow deliberately slow to drum through the themes it wants to touch upon.To those who are patient, this movie tells the controversial story of a woman's decision to undergo what she has gone through, all in the name of Faith, and a man of God's decision to ensure that her message gets told.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

33,siderite,Poorly constructed tale of human ignorance,6,9 December 2005,"OK, the movie was not completely bad. The atmosphere was OK, the actors played well, but everything was either too dry or too dramatized. First of all, after you have seen the movie and you think about the entire story, nothing makes sense. Why would demons possess, then kill a person? Isn't it easier to push her to a life of crime and trashy sex then wait patiently to come in Hell to you? And if you make such a show of possessing someone, why bother to attack the priest, the lawyer and the witness that want to tell everyone what you did? Then the possessed meets Virgin Mary who gives her the choice of dying or staying to show the world that the spiritual world exists. So she chooses to stay and suffer, but dies the next day!Also the courtroom debate was hilarious. It's like a lawyer gets the worst possible case and she invents reasons for the acquittal of her charge, and that succeeds, with a small proof that the system works and a little show of frustration from the prosecution so we know that it was actually a victory.I was humming ""dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb"" through the entire movie. I can hardly wait for the South Park interpretation of this movie.Effects: hardly any. Gore: Close to zero. There is a ""horrible"" picture of the dead girl that we see only little glimpses of. Story: dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb. Acting: OK. Casting: terrible. Setting: what is with the red neon lights? Was this shot in Amsterdam or something?Now about the actual subject of the film. I was amazed to see someone from Belgium talking about a similar case in their country during the release of this movie. I am from Romania and it happened here, too, in the same time! Was it a pandemic possession spurred by this Bin Laden of demons shown in the film? No, it was utter ignorance and neglect. The girl actually died of thirst and lack of air, as she was tied up to a post and gagged with a dirty rag.Isn't it funny that the possessed are always girls? Young girls or small children at best. And always the old wise priest ties them down and ""cures"" them.On the other hand, when a person chooses to believe in possessions as well as her entire family, and she agrees to interventions like this, how can you hold the priest responsible?

35,JamesHitchcock,Suspension of Disbelief,6,19 April 2013,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is the sort of cross-genre movie which combines the conventions of two quite separate film genres which are normally thought of as having little to do with one another, in this case the supernatural horror film and the courtroom drama. The film, although set in twenty-first century America, is loosely based on real- life events which took place in Germany during the 1970s. (The Anneliese Michel case). A Roman Catholic priest, Father Richard Moore, is accused of negligent homicide after he performs an exorcism which goes wrong, leading to the death of the victim, a young university student named Emily Rose. As a lawyer myself, I could not really see what Moore had done which would justify the bringing of so severe a charge against him, at least not in a common law jurisdiction like America. I know that the priests who performed the exorcism of Anneliese Michel were prosecuted by the German authorities, but the facts of that case were rather different, and the legal bases of criminal liability are different in a civil law jurisdiction like Germany. In the film the prosecution case is that Father Moore failed to recognise that Emily was suffering from epilepsy and psychosis and bears the responsibility for her death in that he failed to advise her to seek medical help. The prosecutor Ethan Thomas, a devout Christian although not a Catholic, seeks to persuade the jury that Moore's belief that Emily was suffering from demonic possession is based on nothing more than credulous superstition. Moore's defence lawyer Erin Bruner, although an agnostic, seeks to persuade the court that there may indeed be more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in Ethan Thomas's philosophy. Her fees are being paid by the church authorities, who have been deeply embarrassed by the whole affair and hope that Moore will strike a plea bargain whereby he agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge. Bruner, however, believes that the interests of her client will be best served by allowing him to give evidence in his own defence and by arguing that there are certain spiritual conditions which can be neither explained nor cured by medicine or psychiatry. (She never goes so far as to suggest that Emily actually was possessed by demons, merely that her condition was a spiritual rather than a medical one). Most of the action takes place in the courtroom, although Emily's story, including the exorcism, is shown in a series of flashbacks. Some cross-genre hybrids end up as a real dog's breakfast, either incorporating the worst features of the two genres of which they are composed or else ending up looking like two separate films badly cut together. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", however, is quite a watchable film, despite a few faults. I found it unlikely that Father Moore would have found himself on trial in these circumstances, partly for the reasons given above and partly because, as Roger Ebert pointed out, a secular court was being asked to decide a religious question way outside its jurisdiction. The anthropologist called to testify on Moore's behalf seemed to be going beyond her remit, giving not just evidence about various cultures' beliefs regarding spiritual possession but her opinion as to whether such possession was an objectively genuine phenomenon.The film was, however, well acted, with good contributions coming from two fine actors, Laura Linney as Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Moore, and a riveting one from Jennifer Carpenter as Emily in the flashback scenes. Scenes like these are, perhaps over-familiar from use in numerous films of this nature, going back to ""The Exorcist"" in the early seventies, but this does not detract from the strength of Carpenter's performance. The film's main virtue, however, is the way in which it revitalises two genres. The supernatural horror film in recent years has become a very dull and predictable genre, represented by such almost unwatchable movies as ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" and that new version of ""The Amityville Horror"", a worse remake of a bad original. The courtroom thriller, although there have been some decent modern examples, has also exhibited a tendency to become rather formulaic. Here, however, director Scott Derrickson and scriptwriter Paul Harris Boardman manage to shed new light on the ""exorcism""-type horror movie by depicting these events in a new context and to bring fresh life to the courtroom drama by providing it with unexpected subject-matter. I am generally a sceptic when it comes to matters such as demonic possession, but Derrickson and Boardman were at least able to persuade me to suspend my disbelief. 6/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
36,Smells_Like_Cheese,Facts or Possibilities?,8,12 September 2005,"This is by far one of the best thrillers of 2005. I'm not sure what people didn't like, what were expecting? A jump out of your seat horror flick? There's something I've been thinking about because in my sociology class, we are discussing fear and what causes it. Someone brought up ""The Exorcist"" and asked why it's so scary. I think I can answer that and why it's the same way with this movie.Faith, it's one of the strongest things a person can hold to themselves. It's the one thing in this world we have that can hold our last hope. The fact of something unworldly taking over our body and soul is terrifying. What would happen to us? Many people, faith was a lot stronger I believe in the 70's, had their faith shaken up by ""The Exorcist"". Because no one wants to believe that something like this could happen. I could go on and on about this, I have a 7 page paper on it, but I won't.The movie itself is a great one. The acting is absolutely terrific, especially by Jennifer Carpenter and Laura Linney. You get into the mood of the whole flick and freak out more than once. You will get a couple of jumps out of this movie. But don't expect a big horror picture, you'll be disappointed. Trust me, this is a good movie of drama, suspense, and horror. Please, have an open mind. Why would some people not like this movie? 8/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
37,Rainey-Dawn,A Good Courtroom Drama,6,24 July 2014,"The movie is loosely based on the real life Anneliese Michel. The story itself is quite good. I really enjoyed the courtroom drama aspect of the movie. I did not pick a side (defense or plaintiff) in the movie - instead I wanted to hear valid points and arguments from both sides. Some of the arguments in the courtroom I disliked but in that way it is realistic... you may not like some of the questions, statements and arguments in real life court cases.Some of the ""scary parts"" of the movie had me laughing or poking fun at the scene.... it was just a bit too much for such an otherwise good film. If they would have left some of that out I could have rated this movie a lot higher! The roles are well played by all of the actors. Most are very convincing... particularly in the courtroom! The drama keep me in suspense.For me this movie was well worth a one time watch. I do recommend this movie if you like religious-occult themed horror films.6.5/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
38,disdressed12,Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily) is astonishing,9,24 January 2008,"this movie definitely has some blood curdling moments.the story is basically this:a catholic priest is on trial for causing the death of a young girl eh performed an exorcism on,claiming she was possessed.however,the authorities believe he caused her death.through flashbacks, we see the events leading up to that point,including the possession of Emily Rose(Jeniffer Carpenter).Laura Linney is the Lawyer who takes on the case.Tom Wilkinson is the priest.and Campbell Scott is the prosecuting attorney.but there's more than this to the story.the movie has some similarities to An American Haunting,which came out the same year.this movie has a better,more developed story though,and the acting is better.Jeniffer Carpenter in particular,is astonishing.for me,The Excorism of Emily Rose is a 9/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
39,sddavis63,Is It Possible?,10,31 December 2005,"That simple three word question is at the heart of what this superb movie is all about. Is it possible that demons exist and could possess a person? Is it possible that God exists? Is it possible that good and evil are not mere abstract human constructions, but rather exist in tangible (albeit spiritual) form? Is any of that possible? This film is based apparently on a real exorcism, which lends a more dramatic air to the whole thing.The title aside, this movie is not really about an exorcism; it's about the trial of a priest (Tom Wilkinson) who performs an exorcism on 19 year old Emily (Jennifer Carpenter) and who is then accused of negligence for failing to get her proper medical attention when she died. The exorcism is only shown by way of flashbacks during the trial. The flashbacks are powerful, sometimes creepy and at times quite frightening (more frightening, in my opinion, than the movie ""The Exorcist."") The real brilliance of the movie, though, is the way it intertwines two usually very different genres: a courtroom drama with a horror flick. The courtroom drama dominates, but the horror elements complement it nicely.Wilkinson and Carpenter are excellent in their respective roles, however the more interesting characters were Father Moore's lawyer, Erin Brunner (Laura Linney) and, to a lesser extent - because he was a lesser character - Prosecuting Attorney Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott.) Brunner is an avowed agnostic who is forced to confront the possibility of demonic forces being real, while Thomas is a devout, church-going Methodist who won't even consider the possibility of supernatural involvement in Emily's death.As a clergyman (Protestant) I found myself engrossed by some of the spiritual issues brought up in the movie. I personally believe in demonic forces and in the possibility of possession. Having said that, I have never performed an exorcism and have no desire to ever do so. I did, however, find the questions the movie raised challenging and even sometimes disturbing. The movie doesn't really answer the questions it raises. Two plausible explanations are given for Emily's condition. It's left to the viewer to decide which to believe.All in all, an excellent movie. 10/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
40,Buddy-51,not a conventional horror film,7,15 October 2006,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" approaches its subject matter with a bit more intelligence and thought than we are used to in films of this type. The movie, in fact, is more of a courtroom drama with supernatural elements than a flat-out horror film in its own right.Based on a true story, the film begins with the death of a 19-year-old girl from what appears to be a botched exorcism. The priest in charge of the ritual, Father Moore, is arrested and put on trial for negligent homicide. Erin Bruner, a self-described ""woman of doubt,"" is the attorney hired by the Catholic archdiocese to defend the case. At first, Bruner is skeptical of Father Moore's story of what happened to the girl, but after she herself begins to experience strange, unexplainable phenomena in her own life, she starts to believe that there just might be a plausible supernatural explanation for the death.Eschewing most of the over-the-top silliness usually associated with demon-possession scenarios, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" prefers, instead, to concentrate on the running battle between science and rationality on one side and religion and faith on the other that has become a commonplace in our more enlightened modern times. Although the movie clearly sides with the supernatural explanation, it still leaves room for the more skeptical among us to have their say. The dialogue is generally sharp, insightful and thought provoking and the screenplay treats the spokespersons from both sides of the argument with dignity and respect.Although this film is set in the rural Midwest, the actual ""Emily Rose"" was a German girl named Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 and whose grave in Germany has since become a pilgrimage site for believers convinced that she was indeed possessed by Satan.The real focus of the film, however, is on the lawyer, Bruner, who undergoes a spiritual reassessment as a result of her involvement in the case. Laura Linney, as always, brings a seriousness and intelligence to her role of a woman who has her entire view of the world and how it works irrevocably shaken up and altered by the experience.Die-hard horror film fans may be disappointed by the relatively short shrift given to the possession sequences, which are seen only in flashbacks and, which, despite their commendable restraint, often have the feel of a warmed-over ""Exorcist"" about them (although that is practically inevitable with any movie on this subject at this point, I would imagine). However, it is as a courtroom drama that the film scores most of its hits, and those of us who have watched with dismay the steady degeneration of the horror movie genre of late are quick to welcome this approach.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
41,bensonmum2,"""Once you've looked into the darkness I think you carry it with you for the rest of your life.""",6,3 December 2008,"Supposedly based on (or should that be ""inspired by""?) real events, The Exorcism of Emily Rose tells the story of a priest put on trial for the murder of a girl who died while undergoing an exorcism. Despite what the ads that ran when it was in the theater would have had you believe, it is not the story of Emily as much as it is the story of Father Moore's trial. Included in the many twists in the plot is whether or not the court will accept scientific evidence to support the claim of possession by demons. It's really an interesting and, for the most part, well done film. I had no problems with the plot, the logic behind the central themes in the movie, the acting, or most anything else. I actually quite enjoyed the movie. And as a bonus, I found that much of the film succeeded in being scary. I know a lot of people find these movies about God and demons to be unbelievable, but I think if you grew up with the Church and believing in Jesus, these movies can still be effective. If it weren't for a couple of issues I had with the movie, I could have easily rated it an 8/10. Where the movie really falters is in some of the character motivation and the lighting. Movies with horror themes are usually darkly lit  I understand that. But there were some scenes where I had trouble seeing what was going on. I'm beginning to think I've got a problem with my eyes, but, for example, I could barely make out what was going on in the barn during the exorcism scenes. Or take the scenes of Father Moore in prison. What real prison is so dimly lit? Most prisons I've seen will burn your retinas with the overhead fluorescents you can't escape. And the characters didn't make things any easier on me with the ridiculousness of some of their actions. Suppose you were like Emily and thought you might be possessed by demons. Do you really think you would walk down a dark hall without once trying to turn on the lights? Or what if you were the attorney, Erin Bruner, and you had started experiencing freaky things at 3:00 am every morning. Would you really stumble through your house looking for things that go bump in the night without once turning on a light? The answer to both questions  no you wouldn't. Please, somebody turn on a light! It was so frustrating. I was ready to pull out what little hair I have left.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
42,sol-kay,The Devil's In The Detail's,7,3 October 2005,"****SPOILERS**** Based on the true story of the June 30,1976 exorcism of 23 year old Anneliese Mitchael, who died the next day. The ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" has a true event going for it which is what the ground-breaking 1973 horror blockbuster ""The Exorcist"" didn't.Not exactly what you would expect from a horror/thriller ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" has more of it's story take place in the courtroom then in the church. Father Richard Moore, Tom Wilkinson, had unsuccessfully tried to exorcise the Devil, or his demons, out of 19 year-old collage student Emily Rose, Jennifer Carpenter, that cause her untimely death. Indited for involuntary manslaughter the local Archdiocese want's to do everything possible to keep Father Moore from going on trial and pressure's the court to have the case plea bargained down. The church getting Father Moore high-powered attorney Erin Bruner, Laura Linney, to defend him. Right from the start the trial goes sour for both the church and defense attorney Briner when Father Moore insists that he not only go on trial but take the stand in his defense. Father Moore want's not only to make his case that the Devil does indeed exist but want's to use a modern court of law to prove it even, by being found guilty.With most of the movie taking place in the courtroom and in flashback ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" doesn't have the shock value that you would expect from a Devil/Satanic-like film like ""The Exorcist"". The fact that it's based on a true story, the Anneliese Michael case, overcomes the lack of out and out Devilish horror in the movie. With a court verdict that cuts both ways in ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" surprising ending sequence the movie or Attorny Bruner, does make a far more convincing case for the existence of the Devil. The prosecution headed by D.A Campbell Scott, Ethan Thomas,on the other hand makes a case that Emily is suffering from epilepsy and schizophrenia and that only the ingestion of anti-psychotic drugs, which Emily was on at the time of her death, would have saved her life.Attorney Bruner ,herself an agnostic, becomes more and more convinced that Father Moore is somehow telling the truth about Emily's death being caused by Demons, who also start to attack her as soon she takes up Father Moore's case by the end of the movie seems to have become a true believer. It comes out in the trial that Father Moore could do nothing to save Emily, the same way modern medical science couldn't, because she made up her mind to let herself be possessed by the Devil, to prove that he does exist. Also the fact that Emily was on powerful anti-psychotic drugs which was the very reason that she couldn't fight off the Deamons that were attacking, and eventually took over, her body.Fine performance by Jennifer Carpanter as the possessed Emily Rose who's uncontrollable actions, as she was fighting off and then taken over by the Devil's Messengers or Demons, were as good as anything that Linda Blair did as little Regan MacNeil in the original horror classic shocker ""The Exorcist"".",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

44,Robert_duder,"The most disturbing, terrifying, and intense film ever made period!!",10,21 September 2005,"The Exorcism is Emily Rose will of course immediately be compared to William Friedkin's The Exorcist. The Exorcist was made in 1973 and was so shocking it ended up being to date the most disturbing film. No one had ever seen anything like it. I don't compare the two films much at all because there are some vitally important differences between The Exorcist and Emily Rose. First of all, The Exorcist was made in entertainment. It's a mainstream film chock full of shock value, horrifying scenes. It's not subtle by any means. A young girl vomiting and screaming obscenities would scare anyone. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is supposedly based on true events of a young woman in Germany possessed by the devil himself. The film does not focus on the actual possession but instead revolves around the practice of Exorcism, and the faith involved, good vs evil, God vs Satan and how people feel about it. The disturbing parts of the film are so much more subtle, it's all in how it's directed by Scott Derrickson, who up until now has done some really cheesy horror. Still the world he creates around this sensational trial of Father Moore who is accused of negligent homicide in the care of 19 year old Emily Rose, who dies following a unsuccessful exorcism. Emily Rose is far too realistic, and deeply frightening to be compared to something mainstream as any other horror type film. This film is a drama, suspense, that happens to be horrifying in it's wake. That's not to say there aren't disturbing scenes in the film. There is many typical horror, demon type special effects that also add to the frightening quality but this film disturbs at a much deeper level. It taps into our faith and our decisions about philosophy.Some have mentioned that commercials for this film are misleading and to an extent they are right. The majority of the film takes place in a courtroom in an almost courtroom drama style film. But never once does it take away from the sheer terror of the exorcism or the possession which is looked back upon in flashbacks. The usually stone faced, and rather emotionless Laura Linney does a terrific job playing the tough as nails defense attorney who slowly comes to grips with her own faith as she defends Father Moore for murder. Tom Wilkinson, a top notch British actor does a decent job as Father Moore. He shows compassion and love for Emily and a real faith but his character is so incredibly under used. Even when they finally let him take the stand I thought there was so much more they could explore with Father Moore. Nonetheless Wilkinson does a great job. Jennifer Carpenter who plays the possessed and faithfully strong Emily Rose. His performance is well done, although I thought at times she over acted. However I also know that this role is brutally hard to pull off. I mean she's playing a nice down to earth girl who is being literally beaten and possessed by Satan and five other demons of hell so it would be pretty hard not to. Her bodily contortions when possessed is some of the most disturbing scenes in film history. Her facial expressions also make for a great performance so well done to her. Campbell Scott who plays prosecutor and man of Christian Faith Ethan Thomas does a great job. He's so demanding and a strong presence and right off the bat he rubs you the wrong way so that you don't want to like him but even if you don't he still presents a captivating case for Emily Rose's medical conditions as opposed to spiritual turmoil.To call this movie intense would be the understatement of the year. From the courtroom to Emily's bedside during the possession it so intense, it's overwhelming. I almost felt the need to run outside the theater and scream or something just to break the intensity, it's almost unbearable but to have that kind of effect from a film makes for a good film. Between the battle of the lawyers and the exorcism it's non stop and on top of that you've got the horrifying tale of Emily's actual possession which leaves you breathless with terror. The film is brilliantly done mixing two unusual types of movie into one perfect film. Not only that but it raises some very important questions about faith and Catholicism and Christianity and the medical community and I don't think it ever once leans towards any one person's side but instead leaves you making your own decision even if there is a verdict in the end. I expected a real release when they finally announced the verdict and I would perhaps be disappointed or cause me to think even more than I already was but the verdict and the sentencing was done brilliantly and still came as a surprise!! This is the best film out there right now, anyone wanting a good strong film and a scare on top of that should check out The Exorcism of Emily Rose. One of the best films of the year hands down!! 10/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
45,bowmanblue,Supernatural courtroom,7,25 May 2014,"And by 'supernatural courtroom' I don't mean The Exorcism of Emily Rose is like that scene in Ghostbusters II when the two spooks go crazy and have to be zapped before the slime the judge and attorney.It's apparently 'based on a true story,' but then aren't most Hollywood films supposed to be? The 'real' exorcism involved two priests and, although similar, was heavily adapted for the film version.We meet the teenager, Emily Rose, at the beginning of the film. She's just died during an exorcism that went wrong. The rest of the film is basically a courtroom drama where the prosecution tries to prove that an exorcism isn't a real science and got in the way of proper medication for the patient. Then you have the flashbacks which showed what really happened during the exorcism.Of course if the film made it look like demons weren't really terrorising the young girl, it would make a dull movie. So, we have to believe that the possession was really happened. However, based on what other people have said about the film, some people see this as Christian propaganda, designed to 'prove' the existence of God and the afterlife etc.I didn't see it so. I saw it as a kind of modern day take on The Exorcist. Think of it as a horror/thriller, rather something that allegedly happened. If you view it as entertainment as opposed to a recounting of an actual event, then you should enjoy it, as the possession scenes are decently scary enough and the cast all play their parts well.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

48,filipemanuelneto,A horror film made under an unusual perspective.,7,24 August 2016,"This film, loosely based on a real case occurred in Germany, tells the story of a Catholic priest, tried and charged with negligent homicide after an exorcism gone wrong. Directed by Scott Derrickson, which also provides the screenplay with Paul Harris Boardman, the film stars Laura Linney.This is a film made in an original way: based on the traditional formula of exorcisms movies, it innovates basing on the consequences of the exorcism. Its not for all audiences, contains some shocking scenes for sensitive people, but is much lighter (visually) than other similar films. Terror is more psychological than visual, although Jennifer Carpenter, who plays Emily, be excellent in the production of frightening scowls and grimaces. The film manages a very open attitude towards the exorcism, as the court exposing arguments for and against what happened. The film doesn't assume that the devil exists, although its understood throughout the film.The interpretation of Jennifer Carpenter is regular, only highlights in the horror scenes, contrasting with the good interpretation of Laura Linney (who plays Erin, a skeptical defense lawyer confronted with something beyond her understanding) and Tom Wilkinson, who gave life to a priest visibly guided by faith rather than reason. Unfortunately, almost all the other characters are mere props, never deserve more development. Another major flaw of this film are the special and visual effects. In certain scenes, they result very well and can scare enough but, at other times, they are so weird, so poorly made that seem ridiculous, especially when we see it a second time. The soundtrack sought to accompany the film, but its not different from what we hear in hundreds of other horror movies.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
49,insomniac_rod,What is your name Demon? A Horror movie with brains that offers two different points of view...,10,29 December 2006,"I was skeptical when this movie first came out in movie theaters. I didn't believe the hype towards it because I felt it was a cynical copy of the masterpiece ""The Exorcist"" which is the most influential mainstream Horror movie of all time.""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" is a Horror movie that will make you think and feel. It's a different visual experience.Before I get into detail, I want to share something with you fellow reviewers and IMDb users. Well, many years ago I was haunted by nightmares and some ghost and probably demonic manifestations. You know, some houses have evil spirits or kind ghosts. Who knows? The thing is that anytime I had horrible nightmares or whenever the ""dead fell over me"" (typical Mexican explanation when you cannot move, talk, or scream for no reason), it was 3:00 a.m. When I watched this movie I was totally frozen and finally found out an explanation for the ""attacks"" to occur at that specific hour. Now, I don't know what to believe.When I finally watched it on theaters, I was totally blown out by it's powerful message and it's intelligent story. This is more than a Drama with Horror and religious tones. No, this is a clever, interesting, sad story that goes beyond good and evil. Through the eyes of Erin Bruner and Father Moore we will learn in depth from Emily Rose's case. The movie centers on the trial but also gives us important details about the life of both lead characters. For example, we learn that Erin Bruner is being attacked by the Devil in many manners (clock, bathroom, etc.). Father Moore is also victim of demonic attacks and his faith will be a key part in the trial.Let me explain myself. This movie gives the viewer two different points of view in order to make a judgment towards Emily's death. Both explanations are given through flashbacks during Father Moore's trial and in some other points. Also, both explanations are taken to the legal field in order to demonstrate why some kind of trials reach higher levels of understanding. The legal aspect is very rich on information and tends to objectivize the supernatural and clinical explanations.The first option is to choose the religious explanation. From this point of view; six demons entered Emily's body and tortured her soul for unknown reasons, but it later explained that Virgin Mary couldn't save Emily in her physical form but could only save her soul; thus, to demonstrate that evil roams in earth but with Emily's suffering it's also proved that God exists for us. She's some kind of a martyr and later considered as a Saint. This demons were the same that possessed Judas, Nero, Belial, and Lucifer in the flesh. In a shocking, scary, powerful, chilling, shivering scene; an exorcism is performed on Emily and it's when the devil himself takes responsibility for Emily's torture. The exorcism scene is among the most powerful, scary, and shocking scenes in Horror cinema history. Believe me. I'm not easily scared but this scene truly made me want to cringe, specially when Lucifer's name was mentioned. The f/x were spectacular and scary. Also the music and the powerful acting. Amazing, perfect scene that worths the watch. So in this explanation, the Devil possessed Emily but God and Virgin Mary saved her soul. Remember, ""one, two, three, four, five, six, trick or treat?"" it's a reference to the six demons inside Emily.The second point of view is the medical/scientific that deals with psychosis, schizophrenia, and some clinic diseases that Emily experienced. Some diseases displayed in this movie have to do with mental illness. You may believe that Emily was a very sick girl due to physical conditions and mental diseases.Then, the legal explanation works pretty much just to cover both points of view and only centers on the proofs that people can offer in trials. FOr once, I would like to be involved in a trial like this one. Really.The movie is excellent in production values. The acting is extraordinary. Laura Linney and Tomi Wilkinson deserved Academy Award nominations. Their performances are moving, powerful, dramatic enough to make you believe it was a case involving the Devil. Campbell Scott is great and so is Jennifer Carpenter in a breath taking, tender, and sad performance. Nobody like Linda Blair, but Jennifer is magnificent. She deserves big time recognition. Way to make a Horror movie. Heck, this is meant to be a Horror movie! The direction is also flawless but dull at some points but with the extraordinary exorcism scene and horrific flashbacks it turns out to be a shocking viewing experience. The direction is very classy and has the necessary amount of camera angles on the trial scenes. The soundtrack is also excellent, but nothing extraordinary to talk about. The f/x as mentioned before are excellent and are the best money could buy. The editing is also perfect and goes perfect with the movie's macabre tone.Some chilling scenes include possessed Emily scratching her walls, eating bugs, playing the piano, standing in front of an altar, screaming in desperation, watching demons, the exorcism record on tape, Father Moore watching the Devil outside his house, the scene where the Devil enters a bathroom dressed in a black robe following Erin, etc. Oh and of course, the highlight of the movie: the exorcism. People who enjoy watching scary scenes or jump out of your seat moments, this movie will satisfy you big time.This is a complete Horror movie in all the sense of the word because it features great scary scenes, images, and a chilling story that will scare even the most skeptical. Please, watch it with low expectations and be objective. You might surprise yourself...or may I say, the Devil may surprise yourself.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

And such fears do exists in our modern world and is often the foundation of both our frightening certainties and our supernatural beliefs. That any film can encapsulate the essence of both, is often a test of a consummate director. If attempted, his prowess must therefore depend on his assembled cast. This film, evolves from an unusual case in which a young girl, (Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose) appears to have been physically tortured and brutalized and allowed to die, at the hands of a religious minister. The Catholic priest (Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore) is arrested, will stand trial for Negligient Homicide and faces ten years in prison. The trial as the hard nose District Attorney (Campbell Scott as Ethan Thomas) sees it, can be settled quickly out of court, if the priest pleads guilty. But the defense attorney (Laura Linney as Erin Bruner) is bound by the wishes of the priest who pleads that Emily's Story must be told. Putting the priest's life and her reputation at risk, she gambles on the power of faith to stave off the dark forces arrayed against her and her client. For scientific rationalists, this is unheard of and tests the credulity of the viewing audience. However, for the devout, the faithful and for those who hold God responsible for the world's suffering, this is a necessary movie. It is a landmark film for Tom Wilkinson as audiences are used to seeing him play heavies. A solid story in its own right with none of the terrifying graphics of the Exorcist. ****",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

54,MBunge,The lovely Laura Linney heads up a different take on Gothic horror,6,9 August 2010,"This is an oddly affecting movie, let down only by a long, anti-climactic ending. The story is about (surprise!) the exorcism of a 19 year old girl named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), but it's also about the trial of the priest who failed to free her from supposed demonic possession. The movie begins with the arrest of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) and follows his trial in the present while telling Emily's story in flashback. Erin Bruner (the lovely Laura Linney) is the hotshot defense attorney hired by the Catholic Church to defend Father Moore, but with specific instructions to make the case ""go away"" and prevent any embarrassment. Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) is the District Attorney prosecuting the case. Thomas is supposed to be very religious and Bruner is supposed to be an agnostic, but we see nothing of Campbell's alleged piety and Bruner acts more like a person who's never really thought about religion, instead of a confirmed doubter. With little other choice, Bruner decides to defend Father Moore by justifying the exorcism as a legitimate effort to defeat a real demon. But both her case and Emily's condition in the flashbacks gets worse and worse, until salvation appears impossible for each. One of the most interesting things about this film is that it is largely a straight forward courtroom drama. Even though it's about demons, almost all the overtly supernatural elements are restricted to the flashbacks with Emily's and there are non-supernatural, scientific explanations offered up for all of those events. The courtroom scenes are almost identical in tone and style to what you might see in a John Grisham movie. It's a very different take on this sort of tale and it's quite intriguing. The very real setting in the courtroom makes the fantastic horrors confronting Emily more disturbing, while the threatening evil of the flashbacks lends an edge of tension and uncertainty to the legal struggle over Father Moore's future. The acting is quite good. Laura Linney is wonderful, as she is in just about everything, but Jennifer Carpenter also gives a performance that is remarkable in its physicality. There are some special effects, of course, but Carpenter's own bizarre and unsettling movements, actions and vocalizations largely carry the film when she's on screen. Wilkinson and Thomas are also good, but admittedly there's not much more to their characters than what the script requires. In fact, the story as a whole is rather slick and polished, without a great deal of depth. For a film about exorcism, there's not a whole lot of over religiosity or meditations on Church dogma. You might say, it's a very Protestant take on a Catholic horror story. The problem with the film is that the exorcism of Emily Rose occurs, but the film keeps going. After you're confronted by a young girl in the screaming grip of 6 demons, including the Devil himself, nothing after that really measures up. But the story continues for a quite a while, wrapping up Father Moore's trial. It's not bad or anything, but it goes on for too long after hitting such a dramatic high. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is somewhat scary and smart but a little shallow. It's not a must-see, but I don't think you'd regret giving it a look.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
55,MaxBorg89,A legal horror thriller,8,12 December 2008,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is the most unusual of postmodern genre blends: a horror movie and a legal thriller (though maybe ""courtroom drama"" is better). And the most surprising thing is, it works - the surprise being that writer/director Scott Derrickson's first proper feature manages to be incredibly good, following the awful, straight-to-DVD Hellraiser: Inferno.Allegedly inspired by a true story which occurred in Germany, the film, much like your average episode of CSI or Law & Order, starts with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. The woman in question is Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a college student who appears to have died under horrific circumstances. The family priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson), is subsequently accused of homicide by negligence: he believed Emily was possessed and performed an exorcism on her (with the girl's explicit permission), which, according to the prosecution, resulted in her death. While they try to prove that Emily was epileptic, and possibly psychotic as well, Father Moore's lawyer, Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), though not really a believer herself, sets out to convince the public the priest acted in good faith.The courtroom context could have been the movie's death, and there is in fact a hint of pretentiousness in the scene where Erin enlists the help of an expert (Shoreh Aghdashloo) to provide a scientific explanation for possessions (yep, it's almost as dumb as it sounds), but it does actually provide the film with a tight sense of tension that keeps the viewer interested until the end. These scenes are inter-cut with flashbacks chronicling the various phases of Emily's possession/insanity/whatever, and that's where the film's real heart is: the tragedy of a young girl in a situation she can't control. It's hard to look at those moments and not think of The Exorcist, but they work chiefly thanks to Carpenter's genuinely affecting work (that she did most of her scenes without make-up or wires makes the whole thing even more impressive).This isn't just her show, though: Linney is as good as she's ever been, Campbell Scott, Colm Feore and the rest of the supporting cast deliver as expected, and Wilkinson, having the rare privilege of playing a) the lead role and b) a good guy, is quietly moving as a man torn apart by his faith.Most times, two movies stuffed into one don't work. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a fortunate exception: the ending is a bit of a letdown, primarily because no real answer is given, but it remains a compelling study of faith vs. science.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
56,drownnnsoda,Thoughtful Yet Scary at the Same Time.,9,15 May 2006,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a surprisingly good PG-13 horror film, most of them (there are exceptions, like this one) are crap. But this was pretty darn good. Emily Rose is a devout Catholic girl who is currently attending college. She is just like anyone else her age. That is, until odd things begin to happen and she becomes possessed by demons, including Lucifer himself. The audience is pulled into flashbacks, most of the film actually takes place in a courtroom, where an agnostic attorney played by Laura Linney, is defending a priest who performed an exorcism on Emily before her death.I found this film to be pretty scary, maybe it's because I grew up Catholic, but then again maybe not. All of the cast did a good job here, and director Scott Derrikson (who previously directed a Hellraiser sequel) does a good job with some intense camera-work and visuals during Emily's episodes and her exorcism. I actually think this was a bit more realistic then ""The Exorcist"". My reasoning is that ""Emily Rose"" has much better and effects and depicts demonic possession in a more realistic way than ""The Exorcist"" did (in my opinion anyway). This almost makes ""The Exorcist"" look a bit cheesy. The nice thing about the film also is that it has two sides to it - whether you rely on faith or fact. A believer, or an agnostic? That's why it can appeal to those who aren't religious.To top it off, ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" is a good horror film that blends elements of a scary movie with a spiritual message too. But again, I don't think you will find this film as effective if you don't believe in this sort of thing, but it does have two sides. But it's still pretty enjoyable. 9/10.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
57,davispittman,Interesting exorcism film,7,29 January 2018,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) is a half horror, half court room thriller. It is based off supposedly true events. I have some mixed feelings about it. I'll talk about the positives first. The biggest thing that this movie had going for it is the performance by Laura Linney, the star. She really gives it her all and I couldn't take my eyes off of her whenever she was on the screen. She proved her fine acting abilities in The Truman Show and other films, and this one is no exception. The other actors do a good job with portraying their roles too, but Linney takes the cake. Another positive would be the unbiased nature, this is NOT a film with an agenda of any kind behind it. It does not try to disprove demons and it does not push a religious message either. I like that. Many films attempt to push an agenda, and that kind of preachiness is a real turn off. Now for the things that I didn't really care for. I thought that the court room half of the film was better crafted than the other half. I was more engrossed in those parts, not saying the horror parts weren't well done too, but I didn't feel it as much. The overall story is an interesting one for sure, and when the credits rolled, I felt good about the way they told it, not great but good. That is really the best way to describe this film. Good but not great. 7/10.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
58,EVOL666,Very Good Courtroom Horror/Drama,8,10 March 2006,"I typically don't pay too much attention to current U.S. theatrically released horror films - personally I prefer more ""underground"" sleaze and gore, but I can admit that I AM surprised from time-to-time. After several recommendations from some reliable sources - I decided to give THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE a look. It's actually quite a good film - more of a courtroom drama than a horror film, but still has some ""creepy"" elements.The story concerns 19 year old Emily, and her supposed ""demonic possession"" experiences. She initially starts psychiatric treatment to deal with her ""episodes"", but when this fails to bring relief, Emily along with her very devout family decide to try the religious route. Enter Father Moore, who advises Emily to discontinue taking her psychiatric medicine and to trust in the power of God. When the exorcism fails and Emily dies, Father Moore is put on trial for homicidal negligence - and it's the jury's job to decide whether the Father is responsible for Emily's death...When I first saw the trailers for this film, I was thinking it would be a PG-13 teenie-bopper THE EXORCIST rip-off. That's actually not what this film is at all. It's more of a courtroom drama with flashbacks showing the ordeals that Emily went through during her ""possession"". The girl who played Emily was very strong and believable in her role - but some of the other performances felt a little forced and over-acted at times, but not enough to ruin the film. Definitely an interesting take on Faith vs. Science and is worth a look to horror and drama fans - but be warned - most of the ""action"" in this film takes place in the courtroom, so although the film never really drags or gets dull - don't expect an action-packed horror/thriller either...8/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

61,ptb-8,Save ME instead.,3,21 June 2011,"Hmmm... for the first hour in the set-up we are teased with the interesting idea of a court room whodunnit based around a death during an exorcism. Good idea. Well it all turns tedious when in the second hour we get more of the same, and annoyingly, interesting scary ideas are presented and not followed up. As a result we get a cerebral exorcism based film with a lot of arguing. The occasional spooky bits are 2 seconds of misunderstood nightmare from our hapless victim and then a lot of furrowed brows. Potential subplots such as Laura Linney being menaced by forces at 3am at home go undeveloped and a very Omen like moment with a witness having a car accident means nothing and goes nowhere. At the 90 minute point you can see there is no payoff, and like the equally lame THE RITE it all just fizzles out.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
62,ferbs54,3 a.m.,9,31 October 2012,"As I mentioned in my review of the 2002 film ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" there are any number of similarities between that film and 2005's ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" To begin with, both pictures star Laura Linney, one of Hollywood's preeminent mainstream actresses of the early 21st century, here in a brace of unusual horror outings. Both are products of the Screen Gems/Lakeshore Entertainment production company, and both deal with supernatural events that are purportedly based on real-life incidents. Both films go far in convincing the viewer of the possibility of the bizarre happenings portrayed as being genuine and real (unknowable, highly advanced life forms watching over mankind in the first; demonic possession in the latter), and both, strangely, clock in at precisely 119 minutes. But whereas ""Mothman"" retains its real-life setting and historical basis--the collapse of the Silver Bridge in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, on 12/15/67, but updating it to modern times--the latter film changes its based-on-fact setting entirely. The film is drawn from the case of Anneliese Michel, a 23-year-old German woman who underwent a series of exorcisms--67, to be exact!--from 1975-'76. Michel was convinced that her seizures and depression were a result of demonic possession, and ultimately died, as does Emily in the film, of malnutrition. But the film transfers its action to the American heartland, condenses the 67 sessions to one terrifying one, and changes the victim's age to 19. As in real life, the priest who officiated over the exorcism of Emily Rose is put on trial for negligent homicide. And defending Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) in court is a rising hotshot lawyer named Erin Bruner (our Laura Linney), a confirmed agnostic who enters the case with nothing but incredulity as regards Satanism, demons, possessions and the lot. But as the film's memorable final moments show, the facts of the case go far in shaking her long-held beliefs...and those, most likely, of many viewers!I find it remarkable how many reviewers here seem to be complaining about how ""Emily Rose"" cleaves into two fairly discrete kinds of film: a horror film and the central courtroom drama. Even the esteemed ""Maltin Movie Guide"" remarks that the film is a ""peculiar mix of horror movie and courtroom melodrama (that is) unconvincing on all levels."" Well, all I can say is, I must be more easily entertained or easily convinced than others, because I thought the picture featured some highly fascinating, well-staged, brilliantly scripted and perfectly acted courtroom sequences, as well as truly terrifying scenes of shocking horror. Of course, the lion's share of the credit for the double-pronged success of the film must go to director Scott Derrickson, the two actors already named--Linney really is remarkably good; truly, one of the best we've got right now--as well as to Campbell Scott, as the feisty prosecuting attorney, and Jennifer Carpenter as poor Emily. How convincing Carpenter is as the possessed farm girl; much more so than Linda Blair's Regan MacNeil in 1973's ""The Exorcist,"" and without the assistance of foul language and regurgitated pea soup! Another factor that gives ""Emily Rose"" an edge over the 1973 film: Whereas Regan was possessed by only one entity, Emily is possessed by Lucifer himself...in addition to five other demons! And, as we are led to believe, the epilepsy medication that she has wrongfully been given makes it virtually impossible for any exorcism to be successful on her...a horrifying situation of a sextuple nature.But over and above the ghastly exorcism sequence and the many trials that Emily undergoes, what might chill the spines of many viewers the most might be this notion of waking up at precisely 3 a.m. It was at that moment when Emily is first attacked by her demons, and when Bruner and Father Moore awaken each night to supernatural visitants. As Moore explains in the film, 3 a.m. is the ""demonic witching hour...a way for demons to mock the Holy Trinity...an inversion of 3 p.m., the miracle hour, which is traditionally accepted as the hour of Christ's death."" I defy any viewer to watch this film and then not be concerned about waking up at 3:00 A.M. on the dot! I see a lot of horror films, as my reviews here will testify, and never have the slightest nightmares or qualms after watching any of them. ""Emily Rose,"" however, cost me a good night's sleep, and when I recently awoke at 3:01 A.M., it was with the distinct feeling of having narrowly averted...something. Such is the power and effectiveness of this truly unsettling film. ""It scared the hell out of me,"" Father Moore says at one point during the picture, a reaction that I have a feeling will be shared by many viewers. Yes, ""Emily Rose,"" unlike most, gave me a sleepless night, and I can think of no higher praise for a horror film!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
63,aidanratesmovies,"Critics have missed the point with this film- not perfect, but very well done",9,13 August 2020,"Although it does start slow, and may not be incredibly scary, The Exorcism of Emily Rose feels like a very grounded and realistic horror film that is both well written and well acted. The film does have a bit of a struggle trying to tell its story at first, with things seemingly a bit dull, and repetitive before we get into the issues the film is actually trying to focus on. The look of the film is nothing special, rather grey and dark, but there are plenty of cool shots and well executed atmospheric tones to bring a smile to any fan of the horror genre. Jennifer Carpenter plays the titular character, and does a fantastic job at it. She may not be in the film a whole lot, but considering this is one of her first big roles, her performance is absolutely breathtaking, and her presence on screen is done to perfection in every frame and every second we encounter her. Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also provide some very good performances throughout the film, and for the most part, the film does a pretty good job with its casting in general. The writing is a bit messy at first, but once we get into specifics, there is no doubt you will be captivated and absolutely drawn to what you see on screen, and incredibly invested to see how it unfolds. Scott Derrickson again provides for a good directional performance, and provides a good amount of horror and personal anguish, as he did with another film he directed (and a personal favorite of mine), Sinister. In the end, The Exorcism of Emily Rose can be a bit dull at times, but it's what the film becomes that we truly remember in the end, and it certainly isn't anything short of excellent.
My Rating: 9/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
64,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Good Blend of Court Room Drama with the Supernatural,9,4 October 2020,"This film I saw in the theaters. I don't recall who I went to with or if I went by myself, but I saw it on the big screen and really liked it. It is one that I come back to periodically and just enjoy it in general. Part of it is that the subject matter gets under my skin. It has been a couple years since my last viewing though and it is thanks to the Podcast Under the Stairs Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s. The synopsis here is a lawyer takes on a negligent homicide case involving a priest who performed an exorcism on a young girl.We start his at a small farmhouse. The medical examiner has arrived and we learned that someone there has passed away. He goes upstairs and a priest by the name of Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) leaves a room. The examiner goes in. He comes down to relay that he can't be for sure that she died of natural causes. Father Moore is then arrested.We then get to see the district attorney and his stay decide who will lead the prosecution's case. It will be a religious man be their lead prosecutor, even though he is Methodist, not Catholic, but he brings exactly what they need and the care to handle this matter. On the other side, since Father Moore is Catholic, the archdiocese works with a strong law firm. Karl Gunderson (Colm Feore) approaches Erin Bruner (Laura Linney). She is offered the job, since she just got a man who all the evidence pointed to as guilty off with an acquittal. She isn't happy, but she's using her place and leverage to become a partner if she succeeds with this case. The only thing is the archdiocese doesn't want is for Father Moore to take the stand and embarrass them further.From here the trial begins. What this film does is show us the courtroom and we see what the attorneys and what the witnesses on the stand say. Which this means that we're seeing the events that lead up to Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) as he goes off to college and how she seeks into this condition.The prosecution is pushing that Father Moore was criminally negligent and that was why Emily died. Taking this even farther, their claim is that by taking her off her medication as well as not seeking medical attention to help keep her alive. Erin is trying to prove that she was possessed, or at least she thought she was possessed. There was no medical explanation to save her because it was all in her faith and in her mind.While all this is going on, an evil spirit is trying to frighten off Erin and one of her witnesses. It also continues to come after Father Moore as it did when he was helping Emily. This really does complicate trying to help Father Moore who had her best intentions in mind, but she ended up dying. It will all come down to the defense and prosecution to convince this jury of his peers what to do.This film is both sad and frightening to me. It also has an interesting way of presenting this story to us. The movie sets the tone earlier with the medical examiner doing his job and then having Father Moore arrested. I say it this way, because for the most part, we look at priests as good people who are there to help. Seeing what Ethan Thomas says about him in the courtroom really is an interesting idea where. What works in the movie's favor though is that we just know that Emily passed away and we're getting the evidence presented chronologically through the court proceedings.Now if you follow my reviews, you know that I'm not religious. I am an atheist, but I like to keep an open mind and it doesn't bother me that some people do follow it. For me, I just personally don't need it. Erin is like me in that she is agnostic. She has a crisis of faith as things go on though. I really enjoy the idea that is given the case because of the guy who was probably guilty and she could convince the jury to acquit. Father Moore is a much more likeable guy though so there is that working in his favor. Erin though faces supernatural elements that make her question things.On the other side of this we have Ethan. He is a religious man and he was selected that it makes him a bit more likeable when he goes on the attack of Father Moore. There are numerous times that this is brought up. He is dominating this case for most of the movie as well. What I really like though is when Erin finds some chinks in the armor and discovers some witnesses that might really help her case, we see the uglier side of him. He really doesn't seem as good of person when he starts think he could lose. This is really something that I enjoyed.I want to move this over to the idea of the supernatural vs. the logical. We are in a court of law where facts are really what should be presented. There is also an element of telling someone's version of the story and the way they perceived it or what they tried to do. Erin is fighting an interesting battle here to prove that Emily was possessed, but what I like though is that they presenting it as 'she thinks she is possessed' and her faith is causing a 'psychosomatic' type reaction. On top of this, there are forces that are trying to stop Erin, Father Moore and others from what they're doing.From here I want to take this to the acting. Linney does a good here as this shrewd lawyer. She's good at what she does, there she does some things that are a grey area with the law. It is funny when Judge Brewster (Mary Beth Hunt) notices it and calls her out on it. Wilkinson is good as well. He's an actor that I'm not sure I've seen a bad performance and I'm confident when I see him in a role that it will be good. Scott is solid as well. The person who steals the show is Carpenter though. From what I remember, she did all the body contortions herself and that's amazing. She also shows true fear that makes me feel bad and I like her take on being possessed. There are some good actors in support as well with Feore, Joshua Close, Kenneth Welsh, JR Bourne and Hurt as well.Really the last thing to go over would be the effects of the movie. I'm glad that they really don't use a lot of them. I've already said that I commend Carpenter for what she did with her body as that was practical. They do an effect with her eyes that creeped me out. There was some CGI with faces of characters to turn into demons. I liked this as it is a hallucination. This also made me uncomfortable. The cinematography was well done and the only shot that wasn't really traditional is with Father Moore fleeing something that is haunting him. Aside from that, what they do with the soundtrack for Emily's voice during the exorcism made me feel uncomfortable.Now with that said, this movie is one that I've always liked and it really still holds up for me. The acting really helps drive this movie and there isn't a bad performance. I like that present this information through a court room drama and that when the stories are being given, we go back into the past to see it play out. I'm not really religious, but those elements are good. I am a fan of the corrupt that can come from the innocent for sure. The soundtrack works with the sound design of during the exorcism really working as did the effects and the cinematography. I would rate this as a really good movie, just bordering on being great for me. This I would recommend to horror and non-horror fans alike.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

66,onepotato2,thank you...,7,28 January 2007,"...to everyone who smeared this movie and gave it low ratings. It made watching it a very pleasant surprise.I had no agenda that this should be as scary as the Exorcist or be a straight horror movie. And I generally hate courtroom dramas. But I didn't mind the mix of horror/courtroom drama. And the lack of effects for the girl's possession, which must instead be acted out by Jennifer Carpenter, plays to the movies neutrality. Nothing happens to her that couldn't be read two ways. Special effects would have pushed it over the top. I was very moved by Emily's plight because of Carpenters remarkable acting and body kinesthetics.Faced with the prospect of watching it a second time, I could certainly lose twenty minutes of the early courtroom scenes, but they were necessary for the movie.For the record, I am a major atheist and cannot bear Christianity (It's destroying the country, and the world) For all I know Annalise Michel was just raised to be a religious zealot/fanatic, couldn't cope and tore herself up out of mental instability and intolerance. (It happens) But I liked the movie A note on the production quality: Although I got my fair share of scares, emotions and thoughts out of this, I haven't seen a movie look this cheap since Groundhog Day. 2nd tier talent in the major roles is good (Lynney) or mediocre (Wilkinson, Scott). The bit roles are handed to Canadians finest 4th tier talent, which is not sufficient. Lynney has no friends, life or social sphere because it suits the script or because it's cheaper and things are running long anyway? Tom Wilkinson is earnest which is seemingly all he knows how to portray. The spook expert is a bad actress, directed badly in a poorly written role. A number of unflattering, bad haircuts (Wilkinson, Erins assistant) and one mustache are distracting. Were the actors instructed to style their own hair? Some sets look much too flat and ""constructed"" (the church, the courtroom). The courtroom scenes look like they're filmed in a 1970's church basement. There's a reason (as the director notes) that there are compositions to be made everywhere in the Wrightian courtroom: Wright's prairie style was restless, fussy and beats it's inhabitants into submission. Is that really what you want for this movie? The courtroom here needed to be more neutral, or look more dated. Whatever mood is set up in the narrative is continually destroyed by this ""cheerful"" interior.This courtroom is strictly for episodes of Matlock.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
67,RatedVforVinny,"Creepy, gripping, possession chiller.",8,30 August 2019,"A real creepy story, that was based on the true, highly aggressive possession of Anneliese Michael, in germany (1975). The film is half horror movie and half courtroom drama but manages to handle both genres in the most skilful and dramatic way. i think the only case of it's type when an exorcism lasted over a year and then after her tragic death, the priest was put up on trial. The proceedings are fascinating and the quandary posed for the judge and jury, of how to come to any type on satisfactory conclusion. The film is both very scary and gripping. Certainly not one to watch late at night. One of a handful of films that truly creep-me-out!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
68,nycritic,Anneliese Michel,8,7 February 2006,"In 1968, she began experiencing seizures and was soon diagnosed as epileptic. By 1970 she began to hear voices telling her that she would burn in hell. By 1973 she was under the impression that she was possessed and soon after her parents began to find a priest who could conduct an exorcism. Her behavior became more irrational, her attacks turned her into a monster of violence against herself and her family. By the time of her death, she weighed no more than 68 pounds, her body destroyed and wasted because of obsessive genuflections and unimaginable seizures. She left behind, though, a testimony of her horrific battle and a droplet of hope for anyone who would listen. This was Annelise Michel, the girl whose story is told in THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE.There were questions, through: how did she really die? Was there a case of medical malpractice and the usage of a medicine that could induce hallucinations and a state of mental unresponsiveness which rendered Emily Rose, the girl in the movie, incapable of reacting to the rites? Was there a case of neglect and the priest who tried to help her actually accelerated her death? These are the questions that THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE tries to answer and in this, it becomes the first courtroom horror-drama to hit the screen. Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, the defense lawyer who on a dare takes the case -- she wants to make partner at her firm. She is advised, though, by Father Moore -- the priest accused of letting Emily Rose die played by Tom Wilkinson -- that there are other forces at work here, terrible, evil forces who do not want Emily Rose's voice to be heard, her story to be told.This is a very complex movie to review because so much is left for the viewer to decide and as one who just saw the film, I was not present when the events occurred. Do I believe that this girl, at a time when the hysteria of Satan and demonic possession, further fueled by THE EXORCIST's imprint, was indeed possessed? Do I believe that at 3:00 AM a certain paranormal frequency becomes opened and allows the darker spirits to roam freely and do their evil deeds? Not until one scene in which Emily has a dream in which she approaches the Virgin Mary who tells her she has a choice of either abandoning her physical body or returning to it and be tormented until her death did I catch the meaning of this film, what it was trying to say.Like Joseph Campbell once said in his book ""The Power of Myth"", even the most horrendous things are allowed to exist because such is the nature of what we know as God. Emily's possession, as gut-wrenching and unfair as it is, serves only to further the fact that evil does exist, but is temporary -- it will pass. Sometimes we must endure unspeakable things in order to get to the higher plane -- like Jesus in the cross -- and this is the moral lesson that the movie conveys, which THE EXORCIST failed to do so when it came out because it was more focused on the scare than the lesson of compassion.Such is the lesson Erin learns throughout the evolution of this horror-drama. Her entrance into the movie is one full of poise and cockiness but that gives way to an awareness that there are things around her, which she cannot see at first, that are full of darkness, and at the same time, there are others -- such as a moment when she picks up a chain bearing her initials from the sidewalk -- full of quiet awe that indicate she is not alone, but being guarded. Where Wilkinson in pauses unveils his awful story as the broken man who tried, Linney changes from hard-bitten to hopeful. It would have worked more, though, if Emily Rose (played by Jennifer Carpenter) would have been given screen time before her possession. In seeing her almost immediately under psychic attack, I had but a vague image of a young girl, pretty, full of promise but nothing else. Her scenes as possessed are remarkable, but her scene with the unseen Virgin Mary is touching for its sparse mysticism.There will be people who see this as a re-hash of THE EXORCIST with elements straight out of ""Law and Order"". That is fine, but from a spiritual and equally objective perspective I find this to be, while at times a difficult film to watch, not so much a horror story as a story about compassion even at the most horrific moment in a young girl's life.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The exorcising scenes really scared me, specially when she was in the class room and devil came out of another student. The tension between the scenes and the entertainment from the beginning to the end were exceptional and even for us atheists, it almost leads us to believe in those things.

Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, and Jennifer Carpenter give great performances. Some might be disappointed because most of the movie takes place in a courtroom. Even Jennifer acted well as being possessed by demons. This story is about Erin Bruner(Laura) trying to get Father Moore(Wilkinson) out of jail because people think he killed Emily Rose(Carpenter). This means most of this movie takes place in a courtroom. This film is also scary.

A very good, scary movie, almost superior to the ""Exorcist Series"" which has no connection whatsoever with this film. Not quite as gory or horrific as the original Exorcist, but that might be due to minor cable editing for content and language. Very well done, and definitely worth your time if your horror tastes run to this sort of thing. Supposedly based on a true historical event. Warning! Huge spoilers ahead: It turns out that Emily Rose is the reincarnation of another Satanic-possessed victim from a few centuries ago.

72,mjw2305,The Drama and the Horror combine really well,9,2 January 2007,"Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) was a young girl who died under the care of a priest (Tom Wilkinson) under what appears to be supernatural circumstances. The story is loosely based on true events and sees the court battle to search for the truth behind her death. Laura Linney is the agnostic attorney selected to defend the priest, and the movie plays on three main levels.The court case is very believable drama, these scenes are very realistic and they are simply compelling to watch.The story of Emily is played in conjunction with the court case as flashbacks, these scenes are really un-nerving and very disturbing, capturing the sheer terror of her condition.Finally we also see the evil's impact on the priest and his attorney, the closer the case draws its conclusion the more intense the evil becomes.The direction seamlessly mixes to two genres, creating a fresh and exciting movie experience, the cast are quite simply sublime; Linney, Wilkinson and Carpenter all deserve great credit for their fantastic character portrayal's.It's a scary, dramatic and very atmospheric movie 9/10Don't expect a gore-fest, that's not what this movie is about.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
73,Howlin Wolf,Can Science and Spiritualism Co-exist?,6,31 January 2007,"It's a potentially fascinating question, and if you enjoy watching intricate theological debates play themselves out then part of you will get a thrill from this. I found it interesting because so often religion bases itself on special exemption from what law and government must admit is a partly secular society. So there is material to explore, but in being fair (as it must) and giving equal weight to both sides it sacrifices a little bit of gumption. It doesn't help that what little impetus there is to be found emanates from a willingness to borrow liberally elements in other religious horror hits past.The actual plot dilemma is rather novel, but the trinkets it dresses itself with aren't. It's also a shame to watch a fine actor like Wilkinson become relegated to an object in a tug-of-war contested between personalities beneath his own. He could do this role in his sleep, and too many times it looks as if he is. If you want a horror to exercise the brain rather than the heartbeat though, then this is the niche project just for you.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
74,pyrocitor,"Not without its flaws, but a cut above most horror films",8,20 September 2005,"For the most part, films which were intended to frighten the viewing audience usually succeed in instead producing involuntary laughs. So it was nice to see a 'horror' film that not only has a brain for a change, but actually succeeds in being frightening. It may help that the film is allegedly based on true events, which gives credibility to the storyline, and prevents the movie from having those annoyingly gaping plot holes. And indeed, the heading ""Based on a true story"" doesn't come off as a glaring lie. There are indeed events happening in the film which are questionable as to whether they actually occurred in real life, but the beauty of 'Emily Rose' is that most of the film is retold by various characters, so the events described are as the character perceived them. In this way, the film doesn't distance its audience by declaring that ""well, demons were in the film which was 'based on a true story', so demons must actually exist"".But in many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner. And as for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly obvious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie cliché of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clichés.It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. My only complaint is that the characters of Campbell Scott and Colm Feore were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless. So The Exorcism of Emily Rose may not quite be the very best of its genre, but it certainly proves to be one of the more intelligently made ones. The director seems to have for once taken that extra step, and put aside the endless thrills and shocks in favor of making us think a bit. There are some cheesy effects, such as the demonic visions, but there are some genuinely frightening parts, especially the actual exorcism scene, mainly due to the chilling and captivating performance from Jennifer Carpenter as the title character. The principle cast members, Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also give strong performances, bringing many layers to their characters. Quite the quality piece overall, and one worth seeing.-8/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
75,oneguyrambling,"Part courtroom drama, part horror flick. Stranger still it all works...",7,27 January 2012,"Comparisons with last year's The Last Exorcism are inevitable, both films have simple young women becoming possessed by demonic spirits and the ensuing rituals to cleanse them involve much histrionics, menacing and unexpected dialogue in foreign languages and much physical contortion. But where 'Last' was a fake doco flick with a slow build up and a frustratingly tacked on ending, Emily Rose remains true to tone, and is a somewhat odd 50/50 mix of courtroom drama and exorcism with the key scenes all told in flashback.When we meet Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) he is already under arrest for Emily's untimely death. So we know this doesn't end happily for herHotshot lawyer Erin Bruner is assigned with Moore's defence, and she attacks the case with the gusto of one who sees it as an opportunity for advancement. She is told by the 'high ups' in her firm that their client the Church wants this case to pass with minimal fuss and press – the tacit agreement being that a case involving being possessed by the Devil or such and the inflicted being killed while in church hands being somewhat of a negative.The lead prosecutor is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), who uses his own devout religious beliefs to cast doubt upon the authenticity of the defense's claims. His view is that the accused is hiding his negligence behind religion and he should get what's coming to him.The first half shows the two sides painstakingly building their cases through the usual Law and Order stuff including questioning witnesses, most notably Emily's boyfriend and Father Moore himself.Flashbacks throughout show us that the onset of the condition started at her University and was initially diagnosed as epilepsy. With the side effects seemingly that stuff moves around her room unprompted and everyone appearing to her as if she was under the influence of the Scarecrow from Batman Begins Emily is understandably unnerved.After some unplanned calisthenics and the immediate knowledge of foreign languages Emily heads home and the local Father Moore takes over, himself a rookie at this game having never performed anything resembling an exorcism. While on the case both Erin and Father Moore continue to be 'contacted' or 'influenced' by the demons. Why they would be worried about the outcome of the case I cannot guess I would have thought that where Hell and Satan is concerned any publicity is god publicity.Anyway the latter stages bring out the ever-effective hissing tape recording of events, and a sequence showing the culmination of the exorcism ceremony in all it's glory, with a storm, pestilence and the intensity turned up to 11. Did I mention it occurred on Halloween for good measure? Well of course it does.I liked The Exorcism of Emily Rose and think it slightly better than The Last Exorcism despite the slight compromise necessary due to the courtroom scenes. The ritual scenes were probably less realistic (if that is even a claim) but more effective than the events in the latter film, despite or perhaps because of the absence of gore and shlock. Wilkinson, Scott and Linney do their best to add credibility to events which could easily veer into ludicrous territory given the subject matter, but as tends to be the case it is the performance of the possessed that you look at most, and while I have never heard of Jennifer Carpenter since this film she is up to the job here.Carpenter has an amazingly expressive face and large wide eyes that effectively purvey the inner struggle, pain and stress that you would undergo if a pack of naughty spirits had infiltrated your person. She only gets a few scenes in which to ply her trade but in those brief sequences she provides the two or three more memorable images in the film.Emily Rose might not stay with you for long after you watch it, but for the 120 minutes of its duration you won't find your mind wandering elsewhere too much. With these sort of flicks that's all you can ask really.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Part courtroom drama, part horror film. The two disparate genres don't often mix but somehow they make it work here.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

On the contrary, it finally turns into a corny religious propaganda; it's creepy and certainly talks proficiently (at least at first) about spirituality, insanity and exorcisms obviously. Then it gets pedantic and doesn't manage to raise the rhythm, showing a never convincing intersection of legal matters and religious beliefs.

77,lambiepie-2,"Good, but not Feature Film Material",7,27 February 2006,"I liked watching this film because I am interested in courtroom drama. And lets be honest, that is all this is - a fine courtroom drama with good acting from everyone involved. Laura Linley is always a joy to watch, I can't see Campbell Scott enough and Tom Wilkerson is what acting is all about. Colem Fore is also a good intense actor that never seems to have as much screen time as he should - here is another prime example.But this was not a film to go to the big screen. I could have watched this on Television. A nice two part Mini-series ""event"" would have sufficed nicely. The special effects were not all that shocking - and honestly, they DIDN'T need to be for this story.'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' was one of those cerebral type films: one that made you THINK. You had to take a side. And no matter what side you took, you were still asking yourself: What could have been done to save Emily Rose? Personally, I like films like this - but for a theater experience, I need more thrills and chills. Something to go up my spine and 'feel' what I am being taken through. I watched this, and saw an upper crust courtroom drama. But no chills, no thrills, no shock -- no real connection with the family, the priest, the lawyers...just another day on Court TV.I don't wish to be funny but at points I wondered, ""What would Perry Mason do?"" Perry Mason being one of those talented TV attorney's that kept you interested and riveted against his nemesis, ""Hamilton Berger"". And you had to love Perry's Associates. I missed the 'true' adversarial roles between the attorneys. I missed knowing more about the assistants on both sides.I would have liked to have seen more of the archdiocese wresting with this, as well as the poor family...and of course, more of the life of Miss Emily Rose.Maybe they steered away from all of this because of the phenomenal success of ""The Exorcist"" - which was well written and well flushed out - entertaining, spell binding, sad, scary - crept into your soul even though it was ""fiction"". The filmmakers didn't want their film to be seen as copying from that. No worries, they didn't.The Exorcism of Emily Rose was based on fact and what a riveting story to tell. What hard decisions everyone to make, from the court room - the law and what may be faith and belief -- and where would we really stand when faced with such a crisis.As I've said, a good courtroom drama for DVD & TV...but too weak for a feature film.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
78,ElijahCSkuggs,Interesting and occasionally scary film,7,10 December 2007,"I personally believe that exorcisms and the notion of being possessed by demons, is the scariest possibility in the human world. If well done, a movie on an exorcism can be as frightening as anything else seen in cinema or otherwise, and though THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE wasn't a great film, it was still very thought-provoking and at times rather scary.Emily Rose is a devout Christian, a beautiful young girl who once she attends college becomes attacked and eventually possessed by demons, forcing her to leave school and seek medical as well as spiritual help.After a misdiagnoses for her supposed epilepsy and psychosis, a priest is left to help Emily confront her demons, but is unable. She dies a terrible death, and the priest is to blame.It's a courthouse horror film with the occasional frightening flashback, and is led by a very inspiring, believable performance by Jennifer Carpenter. She's quite gifted, and her physical acting helps seal her role and its validity. Laura Linney as the defense, and Tom Wilkinson as the priest charged of negligent homicide are also both commendable, as is, briefly, Shohreh Aghdashloo, as a spiritual doctor of sorts who helps to explain Emily's condition - I was actually hoping for more screen time for her, seeing as she knew so much on the subject. But the script, especially early on, is a little hammy, with some poor dialog and then some failed attempts to scare.

79,marcin_kukuczka,"Scary, horrifying film with a number of serious drawbacks",4,30 October 2005,"THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE is based on a true story... That is what the subtitles tell you before the first scene of the movie. And you think: yeah, that's what I wanted: a true horror based on a true fact, not a fairy tale. When deciding to watch the entire film, soon will you be led to the mysterious atmosphere by the stunning moment of a look at Emily's house - the moment when Emily's cause of death is being investigated. Why has such a young girl died so horribly? What was the reason? By this moment you sit immobile in a theater seat... but later, unfortunately, the action turns into one supreme issue - court and investigation. Young lawyer Erin Brunner (Laura Linney) figures out the circumstances of Emily's tragic death and defends Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), a priest accused of causing Emily's death by the exorcism which was done by him in a wrong way. If it weren't for the flashbacks, the movie would be a complete failure, scene by scene in a court. But let us concentrate on some strong points now instead of discussing its major mistake.The thrilling atmosphere in the flashbacks is unforgettable. I admit that they partly fulfill the wish to be afraid and to watch a scary horror. The noises, the human-spirit figure in black (demon or Satan themselves), the strangers turning into creatures with satanic imagery. This makes effect. I was particularly shocked by two moments: first, this one, aforementioned, in which Emily escapes from her classes, runs through the streets in extreme fear because every person looks O.K. at first sight but later turns into a demon; second, the scene of exorcism alone. Although the priest speaks the classic Latin that was used two thousand years ago in Rome rather than in the 20th century church, and though there are some huge inaccuracies, the whole scene is very well played. ""We are the ones that dwell within!"" is a clear reference to the legions of demons described in the Gospel. The archaic languages spoken by two different voices coming out of Emily's mouth, Emily scratching the walls in satanic fury... This all made me tremble of fear... Isn't that the thing horrors attempt at? Moreover, doesn't it speak for the existence of devils?Another strong point of the movie are the performances, but not Jennifer Carpenter who is mostly pale as Emily (the only scene she plays well is the exorcism) but the actress very worth attention is Laura Linney as the lawyer Erin Bruner. She does a wonderful job throughout. Another star of the film is Tom Wilkinson who also plays the priest very well, particularly in the moments of his conversations with Erin. Overally, they raise the value of the film thanks to their magnificent performances.SPOILERS: There are, however, some seriously kitschy moments that make it difficult to help laughing. The scene that is the inspiration for the main poster of the movie (Emily in white standing in front of a mysterious tree) is a total waste and stupidity. It was to symbolize the Apparitions of the Virgin Mary. On the one hand, Emily is possessed by demons and, on the other hand, she sees the Holy Mother of God. It depends what your religion is, but the movie says Emily is a catholic and according to the catholic faith, the scene is a sheer nonsense! Even from the perspective of pure entertainment, it has nothing to offer. I went to see the movie partly thanks to this picture, and it disappointed me to a huge extend. There are also some minor details that, discussed in general, spoil the movie and question its logic. For instance, there is a moment that Emily has huge difficulties to eat because she cannot hear the sound that many forks and knives make in the dining room. So why didn't she eat alone? And the inaccuracies in the exorcism scene:the exorcisms are usually done in the presence of the closest family witnesses, not doctors who are checking a person's blood pressure meanwhile.they cannot be done by a priest of questionable morality. Therefore, ONLY a person very close to God and of extraordinary faith can drive demons away. There is no mention of that in the movie.it is all a very serious thing. The film, however, shows it as a sort of sensation. The topic alone seems to indicate that. Then, it depends on the viewer and how he/she deals with such a content. Exorcisms are something that should not to be showed in this way for general public who are not very knowledgeable about these things. As a result, such a movie only serves its purpose to fulfill people's curiosity.As an overall opinion, I cannot say that the movie was rubbish. If you like watching horror films at the end of October, it can be entertaining for you. But it is important to state that it's no great work at all. The court sequence together with some serious mistakes destroys the movie completely! 4/10.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
80,MrGKB,Deceptively marketed courtroom drama...,6,31 January 2008,"...transcends the relatively mundane piety of its screenplay, written by director Scott ""The Birds 2009"" and producer Paul Harris ""The Birds 2009"" Boardman, with very good production values, some excellent cinematography by Tom ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" Stern and editing by Jeff ""The Grudge"" Betancourt, and some excellent acting from its leads. Laura ""Breach"" Linney plays Erin Bruner, an agnostic career lawyer bucking for full partnership by defending Father Moore, a priest (the ever-reliable Brit character actor, Tom ""Michael Clayton"" Wilkinson) who stands accused of the negligent homicide of one Emily Rose. Opposing her is a prototypical prosecutor played by Campbell ""Roger Dodger"" Scott, a man of conventional faith who gives small credence to the supernatural. The twist on this otherwise routine courtroom procedural is that Emily (portrayed very effectively by the oddly beautiful Jennifer ""Dexter"" Carpenter) has died as a result of a failed exorcism performed by Father Moore, purportedly to rid her of six demons. The ensuing legal struggle deals with issues of rationalism vs. religious faith, mostly by pondering the evidential legal status of claimed demonic possession.Unsurprisingly, the film plants itself identifiably on the side of the spiritual, implicitly agreeing with the defense's account of supernatural events, which is the only reason I can think of that it did as well as it did at the box office. The tale apparently heavily embellishes the ""true story"" upon which it's based. Still, if that's your thing, or if you enjoy the work of any or all of the leads, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is at least worth a watch.

82,fwomp,Three Strikes And I Was Done,4,22 April 2006,"THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE had an excellent start to what could have been a really outstanding upgrade to exorcism films of old (obviously I'm thinking about THE EXORCIST). But the ending had so many strikes against it that I nearly turned the movie off.The initial premise of the film was wonderful, though, making it appear as if the audience would decide what really happened to Emily (Jennifer Carpenter). Showing back-story during the court case in which a priest is on trial for her death intrigued me. The courtroom drama unfolded with two aspects being shown: one moment we see the medical possibilities of what Emily may have gone through (""Was she an epileptic with a form of psychosis?""), while the next we're introduced to the possibility of demonic possession (""Can an epileptic be conscious during a convulsion and speak Aramaic?"") I was spellbound by the medical/religious dueling and I gave a bit of credence to both sides ...for a while.Tom Wilkinson plays Father Moore, the Rose family parish priest, who was assigned the task of performing the exorcism by the local arch-diocese. But the exorcism goes horribly awry and ""the demons"" remain in Emily. She deteriorates and eventually dies ...which is where the film starts. We watch a medical examiner enter the Rose house and proclaim that he can't prove Emily's death was by natural causes, so Father Moore is arrested for negligent homicide for not seeking medical attention.The Catholic church has an attorney firm on retainer and asks for their rising star lawyer, Erin Bruner (Laura Linney, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), to represent Father Moore. But taking on the case may just be the start for Ms. Bruner. Father Moore tells her that ""evil forces surround this trial,"" and it is here that the film begins to unravel. Instead of leaving it to the viewer to decide what might have happened to Emily, the film becomes a heavy-handed treatise on God, sainthood, and excessive religious symbolism. This completely deflated any possibility of a medical diagnosis, thus ending any after-movie discussion about what the message of the film might be about.Conveniently, Erin Bruner finds a locket on the ground with her initials inscribed on it, giving sledgehammer understanding as to why she decides to continue with the case (""I found that locket, of all people, and I guess it means maybe I'm on the right path""). Give me a break. Strike one! Then Father Moore miraculously produces a letter that Emily had wrote before she died, telling everyone that because Emily was a good person, and made a tough spiritual decision, she ""might be considered for sainthood in the future."" Excuse me? Sainthood for one action? And what about the wounds to Emily's hands and feet. Stigmata, of course. Wait. Stigmata? On a possessed person? Strike two! And then we get to the sentencing of Father Moore and the ridiculous ""recommendation"" by the jury. Would a judge really, honestly, legally, consider that? Maybe. But was it believable? Absolutely not. Strike three! You're out! Had the film retained its ""is it medical or spiritual"" uncertainty throughout its length, I felt this would've been a fantastic success. But as it sits now, it's just a pile of rubbish. What a shame.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
83,gregsrants,Perfect First Date Movie,7,11 September 2005,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is the perfect first date movie.Even as I typed that opening line, I found myself shaking my head from side to side in almost disbelief of what I was trying to say. After all, to try and work up the courage to walk up to a woman and ask her to spend your first encounter on a film that has the word 'Exorcism' in the title doesn't exactly sound like a guaranteed I-am-getting-to-first-base idea.But in a summer that has delivered Batmen, hit men spouses, human cloning and tripod aliens, this is about the best chance you have of leaving the theatre with the date attached on your arm. Sure, there have been comedies. I myself am in the process of trying to impress/woo (or whatever the young people call it now a days) a young dynamo at work and thought The Wedding Crashers to be a good choice for the first sharing of a popcorn tub. Although I know now that it was a much better choice than The 40-Year-Old Virgin or The Constant Gardner would ever have been, I still wish this new courtroom drama/horror/thriller was available in my local listings at the time I asked her to join me (Ok, she asked me  but enough of my personal life).So what is the movie about? Well, this is one of the few good examples where the title of the film sort of tells it all. The Exorcism of Emily Rose, is about, well, the exorcism of Emily Rose. Told through flashbacks as described in the trial of the Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), a priest on trial for the death of Ms. Rose (and before anyone gets their nose out of joint, it is no secret as the first scene indicates that Emily is no longer amongst the living). Father Moore is being defended by Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), an agnostic that wants to use the trial as a stepping stone for her career. On the other side of the courtroom aisle is prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Roger Dodgers Campbell Scott) and the two go toe to toe trying to argue both sides of an argument that asks if religious treatment instead of medical treatment lead to the negligent homicide of young Emily.The story unfolds very much like a Law & Order episode. In fact, director Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno) stated that this is the first ever courtroom horror film ever made. Both sides offer compelling arguments on either side of a religious debate even though neither of the two lawyers are very interesting characters.But watching the commercials and trailers for the film and you wouldn't know that the movie had any courtroom drama whatsoever. It promotes itself as a fright film and there are enough scares and chills in the film to qualify it as such. In fact, if you review the bigger fanfared horror films released lately  The Grudge, Dark Water  this film outdoes them by miles simply by using effective lighting and going back to the ABC book on how to effectively scare an audience. That means you don't need to have cats jump out of closets or big budgeted special effects to put someone closer to the end of their seat.It came to my surprise that I enjoyed Emily Rose. The Labor Day week-end is usually one of the year's weakest and studios tend to hold on to their poorly test marketed entries just throwing them at this week-end in hopes that it sticks. But Emily Rose was the perfect mix of interesting subject matter and goosebump instilling scenes and was a good fit right before we get into all the serious Oscar contenders that begin to be released in the fall.So for those of you looking for a first date adventure, Emily Rose might well just prove to be the ticket. For us second date adventurers, we'll just sit by the phone and await a call.www.gregsrants.com",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

85,rainking_es,"Scary, but probably not too ethical...",7,8 April 2006,"I admit that many sequences from ""The exorcism of Emily Rose"" scared the shht out of me... and since that's what I was looking forward when I decided to watch it I say that the authors have fulfilled their task notably. The shadow of ""The Exorcist"" is present in all the sequences referring to the ritual of the exorcism, but I guess that's inevitable. As for the parts of the movie dedicated to the trial they0re just OK, using most of the topics of that kind of genre (remember this is a movie based on real facts: a German girl was murdered in the 70's while a priest was trying to exorcise her) . And now, let's talk about something that bothered mew while I was watching the movie: is it ethical? I mean, the movie seems to justify the acts of the priest and of the family of the girl. That girl died because of the superstition and the ignorance of her family, not because she had the demon inside. Or any of you believe in demons? So, you cannot create that ""reasonable doubt"". This kind of conditions must be treated by psychiatrists, not by priests or gurus. Putting all that aside, ""The exorcism of Emily Rose"" is quite a good horror movie.*My rate: 7/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Im not usually into the whole exorcism thing but this one was not bad because it went at it in a whole different way. The actors did a good job and it was entertaining also based on a true story which adds to viewing experience.This movie is about a lawyer who takes a case to defend a priest agaisnt a neglegent homicide claim. The priest is on trial because a young girl who he performed an exorcism on died during the process. He claims she was actually a demon.This movie is pretty good not really scary though. I dismiss these religious things like possession and all that its all just non sense but overall not bad movie.,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
87,Superunknovvn,"Very thrilling, but the ending leaves you longing for more",8,10 December 2005,"Yes, I know, we've seen too many mediocre horror movies in the past few years. Yes, I'm fed up with horror stories that are ""based on true events"", too, but don't write this movie off too soon. If you ignore the assertion that this has all happened in reality and just accept that you're in for a supernatural movie, you'll have a gay ol' time with ""The Exorcism Of The Emily Rose"".The first thing to mention is that there has never been a combination of horror movie and courtroom drama before, and while some reviewers have stated that the two genres don't go together well, I have to disagree. The courtroom setting added a lot of suspense to the story and horror movies always work best when there is suspense added to the spooky and creepy elements. And boy, does this movie have some creepy scenes.The four main actors do a fine job and the restrained direction is pretty atmospheric too, except for some minor fashionable shots that are probably not going to age very well (for example, one time Scott Derrickson reverts to Darren Aronofsky-cam, which is already getting old). Anyway, the main attraction is the story itself, and as I've said, it's fast paced and exciting - at least until the third act. Up until that point it's hard to watch the screen at times because Derrickson uses his shock scenes so effectively and steers clear of any jump-clichés. Then a certain climax is reached, the movie reduces its supernatural elements and relies maybe a bit too much on the courtroom drama aspect. On the plus side Derrickson avoids going over the top like so many other horror movies do including embarrassing CGI-orgies in their showdowns. On the other hand, it is exactly that relatively quiet ending that prevents ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" from becoming a real classic. One just has the feeling that the priest and the trial made a whole lot of fuss about nothing, because there's no real solution in the end.""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" has enough chilling moments not to be overshadowed by ""The Exorcist"", the big Kahuna of the exorcism genre, but it's not going to be remembered as a cornerstone of the horror genre. In 2005 you couldn't find a lot of spooky movies that were better than this one, though.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
88,Darkside-Reviewer,The Erin Brockovich of possession movies,4,31 July 2019,Excellent performances from all involved sadly this movie focuses more on the court proceedings of the preist than it does following the possession of Emily Rose so much so that the title character has around fifteen minutes of screen time the rest is all court room hearings and exposition shots very boring.The movie follows Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) as he is tried in court for the death of Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) after a failed exorcism he is accused of providing inadequate care of her that ultimately led to her death he is defended by Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) who takes this high profile case as a way of proving to her boss she is worthy of being partner at her law firm but after meeting father Moore and listening to his story of the possession and death of Emily Rose she begins building a case to free him and has her own crisis of faith when supernatural forces begin to haunt her and those involved in the case.The movie is well shot and directed and the acting from everyone involved is excellent especially Jennifer Carpenters possession scenes from her body movements and screams to even just her eyes she really sells the characters torment and slow decent into madness and torture by the demonic forces invading her sadly we only get a few scenes of this as seventy percent of the movie is a courtroom drama.I recommend this movie for people who are fans of demonic possession movies just be aware the movie is slow and dialogue heavy which focuses on the court room drama more than the actual possession.,The Exorcism of Emily Rose

91,MichaelMargetis,Law & Order: DPU - Demonic Possession Unit,5,11 September 2005,"The latest creepy horror fest 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is nothing like the movie trailers make it out to be. I was expecting just a plain horror movie, but it ended up being like a courtroom drama with some creepy overtones. Yes, there are some 'holy crap!' scary scenes lodged into this, but it is mostly a drama (a lot of the time slow-moving). You shouldn't go into this expecting what I did, just expect a two-hour 'Law & Order' episode surrounding demonic possession, you may like it better than I did. I was enthralled by some of the film, but overall disappointed with it. Too bad.'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' surrounds the real life court case of a priest, Father Moore (Academy Award Nominee Tom Wilkinson - In the Bedroom) who is charged with negligent homicide of a young , Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) who supposedly died during an exorcism. Taking on Father Moore's case is a sassy, smart and sharp rookie lawyer, Erin Brockovich (oops, I mean Erin Bruner) played by Academy Award Nominee Laura Linney. Father Moore and Erin must work together to get Moore off the hook and to tell what really happened to Emily, while fighting the devote and stingy protestant prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott - Roger Dodger) and his theories about how Emily wasn't possessed just had a both epilepsy and psychosis. The film takes place after Emily has died, and she is featured in the flashbacks during the court proceedings.The movie has a few good scares and I admire the original premise, but the film really drags during the beginning and end. There are moments or sequences of 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' that are breathtaking and on-the-edge of your seat kind of , while other scenes are so boring you may fall asleep. One very positive thing you can say about 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' is that the acting is absolutely top-notch with startling and powerful performances from Linney, Wilkinson, Scott and young Jennifer Carpenter who does a very good job in her first major role. Scott Derrickson does a decent enough job directing and I felt the screenplay needed some serious revisions.When it's all said and done, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' ends up being kind of a mixed bag. It has some very good qualities to it, but also has some significant bad qualities. I can't recommend it for theater viewing, but I can recommend it as a good rental when it finally makes it way to Blockbuster. Maybe the sole reason I didn't like 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' as much as I could have is because I was expecting a totally different film and the movie trailers lead me to believe that. Anyway, something about the film just didn't sit too good with me. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 9/10/05)my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces).",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
92,t_atzmueller,What if we'd take the devil to court and who would win the case?,7,24 December 2014,"The title alone will conjure up two images, one being that it's a) a horror-film and b) yet another variation of the occult-blockbuster The Exorcist"". This is not entirely wrong (it is mainly a horror-film and does borrow heavily from William Friedkins film), but at the same time only scratches the surface.Loosely based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, one would have hoped that the film delves more into the psychological aspects: Michel was a bright, young student in Germany, who was brought up in a almost fanatical Christian background. Suffering from epilepsy and what would later be diagnosed as schizophrenia, Michel at one time became convinced that she was possessed by demons (among them the emperor Nero and - I'd almost would like to say naturally - Adolf Hitler). This conviction was only nurtured by the local clergy and Michels fanatical parents, ending in the girls death after a lengthy ordeal of exorcisms, self-abuse and starvation. In Germany the story caused a stir and most involved would surely have gone to prison, if they wouldn't have been protected by the cloth of 'holy men'. The recordings of the priests interviewing (if you want to call it that) the girl are in the public domain and still give the listener a chill, whether one believes in the supernatural or not.But ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" chooses to go another direction. Though the aspects of mental illness are brought up, the producer opted for a slightly more supernatural angle (or at least subliminally). Sure, the movie has some rather spooky, even scary moments, especially during the short vision sequences of Emily Rose and the often disturbing play by Karen Carpenter. The actress does an utterly convincing and excellent job. The rest is pretty much a court-room drama, concentrating on a lawyer defending the priest that may (or may not) have been responsible for Emily's death. An interesting premise, especially in this time and age where religion once again is trying to con its way into everyday life, from schools to politics. For that, the often sinister atmosphere and Carpenters intense performance the film gets a well deserved 7/10 from me.For those interested in the case of Anneliese Michel, I'd recommend the German movie ""Requiem"" Hans-Christian Schmid, which deals with the whole issue without any hint of supernatural mumbo-jumbo. It's a bit on the lengthy side and way more pedestrian than ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", but nevertheless a fine reconstruction of the last days of Anneliese.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

You get about what you expect, with this banal drama centering around a dead girl who may or may not have been killed by a priest. Don't be fooled that this is some freak-out horror flick, as instead you're treated to the umpteenth court case from either television or movies. And this one is more awkward as it's asking the jury to buy the plight of this holy man whom (allegedly) was attempting to exorcise a possessed girl who meets her demise. The film was neither creepy or engrossing, just slack-paced and disinteresting. All attempts at eeriness don't come off, because unlike ""The Exorcist"", no music was relied on. Here we get those annoying ""clangs"" on the soundtrack and dramatic violin music. ""Exorcist"" worked because it just relied on quiet being broken by a deranged spirit, not to mention nasty body movements and profane outbursts. This girl just sits up and spouts Aremaic nonsense, then collapses. The performances are fine, but the material is sleep-inducing. You know what film to rent instead.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
95,nitzanhavoc,"While not a Horror film, still one of the best possession / exorcism films ever!",9,10 May 2013,"The only fair way to begin this would be to say that The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an excellent film. It isn't a typical film of the Exorcism sub-genre of Horror, not is it a typical Horror film of any kind. The tagging is quite accurate, it's first and foremost a crime/courtroom film, secondly a drama film, and only finally a Horror film. Although ye be warned, for the Horror bits are just as frightening as they should be.Based on true events of a woman who supposedly suffered similar occurrences, the screenplay is great. Rather than experiencing the story first hand from the point of view of the possessed or haunted, as we usually do in possession and exorcism films, we are told the story retrospectively as the exorcist priest states his case in court with his defense attorney. The story includes secondary tales of the dynamics between the attorney and the priest, between the attorney and the DA, between the attorney and her boss and regarding the attorney's faith and beliefs. While lacking a good plot twist (probably in order to remain true as possible to the original occasions), the story is good and compelling.The acting is excellent, professional and convincing. I for one have especially enjoyed the charismatic and energetic Campbell Scott as DA Ethan Thomas, and even more than that - Jennifer Carpenter as possessed Emily Rose. It's not easy playing such a role after decades of ""The Exorcist"" sequels and other such films, and yet Carpenter has done a terrific job scaring us straight!The direction is just the way it should be in such a film, combining the aspects of a good courtroom crime film with a good possession/exorcism Horror film. Cinematography is also good but not an emphasized feature here. The soundtrack is actually what let me down a little, as I've expected at least some creepy music fitting a film dealing with supernatural demons.All in all, I must say that a devout fan of Horror films in general and exorcism films in particular - I've enjoyed every second of this film, and would highly recommend it even to people who aren't Horror fans but like a good crime drama. It's a very rewarding experience, and now having watched it twice I'm sure there will be a third time. Great film!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
96,moviemanMA,An Exorcism with a Message,7,13 September 2005,"Exorcisms have been carried out by the Catholic Church for hundreds of years. It is basically the removing or calling out of demons from people who have been ""possessed"". Who knows for sure what goes on during these rituals. The Catholic Church doesn't say much, but what we understand from books and more recently in movies is that they are not pleasant and can be quite terrifying.Director Scott Derrickson brings to the screen The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A true story about a girl named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), a 19 year old farm girl who was looking forward to going off to college. But this wouldn't be any ordinary semester. It would be at school where she would become possessed by what seems to be demonic forces.The movie opens to the investigation of Emily Rose's death. Her family's priest Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is under arrest for negligent homicide due to the unsuccessful exorcism and ultimately leading to her death days later. The archdiocese appoints Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) to defend father Moore in his trial. Bruner has her head held high due to her last case where she got what seemed to be a murderer off. She says that she has no decisive religion but will be dealing with a whole lot through this case.The main question that can't be answered completely is whether or not Emily was actually suffering from a form of epilepsy and psychosis or if she truly was under the influence of demonic forces. Father Moore only wants to tell Emily's story, he wants to relay her message from all of this to the world so they can see what it truly feels like living a tortured life.The movie offers a lot to be absorbed. It asks us to really check ourselves and if we believe that their is a scientific purpose for everything or whether or not supernatural occurrences can be the answer to the unknown like in this poor girls case. It is a very compelling story and will have you on the edge of your seat until the last frame. It isn't like your classic horror movie with special effects taking over and pulling away from the story being told.Linney and Wilkinson are spectacular in their roles, each representing a different side of religion. Even the prosecutor Ethan Thomas, played by Campbell Scott, gives us an interesting look on faith. Wilkinson shows us the extreme faith in God and that the supernatural are the answers for certain things. Linney is more of an middle man in that she says that she has no side to this but learns over time that this girl really had problems of the unknown. Scott's character shows us how a religious man only wants the facts and nothing but the facts. Three mindsets that everyone can put themselves into.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an intense dramatic thriller that will have you fighting back fear yet overcome with intrigue.

It's not a typical horror movie. It's a combination of horror and drama. The movie focuses both on the court case and the exorcism. Usually when I watch a demonic horror movie I tend to slightly role my eyes because it always feels a bit too much so it doesn't make you feel like it's possible but this one actually makes you wonder.

However, if you want a quiet, thoughtful, intelligent examination of good, evil and the power of faith, then this movie just might be for you.Based on the true story of Annelise Michel, a young German girl who died during an exorcism in the 1970s, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a courtroom drama first and a horror movie second. 19 year old Emily Rose is dead, and Father Moore is on trial, accused of having denied the possibly epileptic and psychotic Emily proper medical care in favor of an exorcism. Erin Bruner, an ambitious young lawyer, agrees to defend the Father in exchange for a full partnership in her firm. But as the trial progresses, Erin gets a glimpse into a world of darkness and evil and a glimpse is all it takes to rattle her cage. The story of Emily Rose unfolds in flashback as witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense recall the devout Emily's short and tormented life. Was she indeed an epileptic whom medicine could have saved? Or was Emily touched by god and possessed by demons, destined for sainthood?There is no projectile pea-soup vomiting in this movie, no swiveling heads and no gore whatsoever. And yet, the atmosphere of this movie is genuinely creepy, filled with a quiet, nerve shattering dread. The performance of Jennifer Carpenter as Emily is outstanding; her bodily contortions and wicked facial expressions are quite disturbing in the few scenes where she is allowed to explode with wrath and violence. But it's the silence in this movie that freaked me out the most: the heavy silences in dark rooms where you know something is moving around with ill intent but you never quite get to see what it is. A few quick glimpses of a black hooded Something are subtle and spooky without being cheesy. Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore is excellent as he always is, playing the priest with a quiet dignity and giving us a very human character who only wants to tell Emily's story and accept his own fate with grace, no matter what it may be. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner does a great job as a focused, no-nonsense business woman who nevertheless learns that she can still be scared of the dark.All in all, I was really impressed with this quiet, thoughtful tale. Cheap splatter and lame BOO! techniques are cast aside in favor of a serious look at our beliefs and our disbeliefs, and in the end you are left to make up your own mind about Emily. This film still manages to be quite scary in places, but it's a nice, Adult kind of Scary that you don't see too often anymore.

Excluding a couple of handful of 1990's religion-driven horror movies, there weren't any shocking exorcism scenes like there was in The Exorcist. The possession sub-genre changed when The Exorcism of Emily Rose, along with a couple of Exorcist prequels, hit theatres and really spurred a flurry of possession related movies. The film is also a trendsetter by the fact this it used jump-scares at unexpected moments, which has become a very popular ploy for filmmakers.
 Jennifer Carpenter being twisted up like a pretzel was still unsettling to watch even after all these years. Carpenter as Emily Rose did a terrific job playing the distressed young woman helpless to the demos possessing her. Veteran actor Tom Wilkinson plays Father Moore, a unique role for him, but he also succeeds in making the film better as well as the main lead Laura Linney who did put together a solid performance as the ambitious, tough as nails lawyer. The film did slow down in some of the court scenes and there are some eye-rolling pieces of dialogue and plot-points but the problems were sporadic. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an enjoyable movie, still creepy in parts, and its really a shame that more critics didn't get around to seeing how suspenseful and interesting the film was.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It's understandable the trial should be the centrepoint of the movie, but by making it so boring and paint-by-numbers, the filmmakers force us to focus on the interesting, meaty stuff - the scary flashbacks. And, since they're so well done, why not? All of the flashbacks, from the hauntings through the possession to the actual exorcism, are so well executed and topped off with a great performance by Jennifer Carpenter that it makes up for the courtroom scenes. It is unfortunate, though, because there's an interesting philosophical debate going on in the trial - faith vs. science - one that ultimately become silly with the Virgin Mary nonsense. Also, the film should have left the final decision - faith or science - ambiguous, but the scenes with Laura Linney being haunted - totally ridiculous and not scary - undo any chance of this.

The visual and sound effects are jarring. The stricken Emily is both pathetic and scary. It has its moments, but so do the worst of teen slasher films. Campbell Scott and Laura Linney both seem to be struggling with more than the script. Colm Feore puts in his leering best. But, overall, it feels flat and rather cheesy. It is unclear to me whether the fault lies in the original story, allegedly based in a real account, or whether the attempt to make the story screen-worthy just went flat.

In this movie however I felt the focus was on the very tragic side which ended with the death of Emily. Yes, there are some eerie moments but overall it's not correctly placed in the horror genre. It's way more a drama, court thriller and in this light the Exorcism of Emily Rose is very good. Mrs. Carpenter is simply amazing and totally believable in her performance 9/10. Given the relatively short screen time she holds everything easily together. She portrays a women suffering potentially of mentally illness, possession or something completely different. Her desperate search for help is truly heart wrenching! Mrs. Linney as the attorney gives also a great performance seeing how she evolves during the case once more and more details are revealed.

After her death he is charged with criminal negligence. Taking up Moore's case is Erin Bruner; know for winning hard to win cases. She isn't really religious, but starts to feel an unknown presence when she takes the case. During the court room and through conversation with people, we are taken back to see what happened to Emily and how it came to her death.When making a film about exorcism, it is a hard subject to tackle. Not many movies have really succeeded with the area well. When in concept you think of adding a court room drama into the horror style nature of the subject of exorcism, it becomes quite interesting. Though when it plays out, it doesn't really make it any better. When we are in the court room, it the down point of the movie, as it detracts from the main idea, what really happened to Emily. Though in the flash backs we see what did happened, but it needed more to it. They should have focused more upon Emily and her tragedy, the fight against God and the Devil, not the fight between lawyers.There are some good intense moments. When Emily is first attacked in her room and when Erin experiences a similar event are very well done. The demonic faces that Emily see are disturbing, and Emily's body contorts are equally disturbing, but they are kept to a minimum. They needed more of these scenes to keep the suspense up. The exorcism is done good to, it initially seemed flat as the court room, but picks up when they are in the barn, it really gets going then. But its short lived, should have been a lot more to it.Though it doesn't reach the level of horror or drama it was wanting, its still an interesting watch. It's about time they left the topic of exorcism alone.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
104,mOVIemAN56,Chilling and suspenseful. Succeeds on every level.,9,10 September 2005,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is the recounting of actual events of an exorcism gone bad and its aftermath in the early 1970's. Instead of the film being held in the 70's, the film is brought into present time to give the audience a bit more sense of authenticity, or something like that. The films begins in a chilling way with actual sounds record from the exorcism and with the death of Emily. After her death, Fr. Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is put on charges of negligent murder and is to be defended by the exceptional lawyer, Erin Bruner (Laura Linney). The film takes us through the trial from the beginning to the end. But instead of being another courtroom drama, the film brings suspenseful flashbacks of Emily's last weeks and her invisible possessor. The film is one of the most interesting and chilling films I've seen in a while. It is a courtroom horror film. The film is never intended to truly frighten you, just to show what actually happened to her, whether the viewer believes it or not. The special effects are never overdone or over used, the loud background music does get old and some scenes are a tad unbelievable.Even though some parts of the film don't work well, it is overall frightening. Laura Linney does an exceptional job as Erin Bruner. She brings a powerful performance of a person torn between what is sensible and what real. Tom Wilkinson continues to prove that he is among the top actors in the world with stunning performance of the accused priest fighting in the name of God.But above all others, Jennifer Carpenter is the best off all. Her twisted faces, her contorted body movements, and her above all else us of her voice is incredible. She barely has any lines and is the most powerful of all characters. She is able to bring the horrible powers that have literally affected millions of people and brings them into a sense that The Exorcist did not.The film succeeds on every level, from its odd sense of horror to its courtroom drama. The acting is top-notch and the cinematogrpahy is strong. Don't miss this one!The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Starring: Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Jennifer Carpenter, Joshua Close, and Campbell Scott.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
105,Li_85,Great stuff...Realistic...,8,12 June 2006,"This is a mix of Horror and court room drama. We all want to know what happened to Emily Rose. Was she really possessed or was it some kind of Illness. The answer is possession in my opinion as well as the film. Many people will find this hard to believe especially in USA and UK, since there is not much news on Ghosts. If you go to Africa and some parts of Asia, people know there are ghosts. I personally do, because i have seen similar incidents happen with my eyes, when i went on holiday in Asia. I think Emily Rose is a brilliant example of what is out there. Great Acting, This is a Class Horror movie. There are some weaknessess like the scene where the man gets run over by a car. The movie was going perfectly, but they had to exaggerate it. Another true story is The Exorcist, which was also exaggerated too much with the demon stuff. Overall A Decent Film.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
106,MovieGuy01,Absolutely teriffying horror film.,9,8 October 2009,"I thought that the Exorcism Of Emily Rose was a fantastic horror film. It is about a young nineteen year old Catholic college girl called Emily Rose(Jennifer Carpenter). The Exorcism of Emily Rose tells the trial of the priest accused of negligence resulting in the death of the young girl who is believed to be possessed In an rare decision, the Catholic Church officially recognises the demonic possession of the 19 year-old college girl Told in flashbacks, the lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) takes on the church when she fights in defense of a priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) who performed an exorcism on a young woman, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). The priest agrees to let her defend him only if he is allowed to tell Emily's story. The trial begins with the calling of several medical experts and also the prosecutor, Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott). One of the experts says that Emily was suffering from both epilepsy and psychosis. The defense says that she may have actually been possessed, and that Father Moore as well as her family realised this and tried to help in another way. While alone in her dorm room one night, at 3:00 AM, she smells a strange burning smell from the hallway. When she checks on it, she sees the door open and shut by itself several times. When she goes back to her room, she sees a jar of pencils and pens move by itself. also her bed covers roll themselves down, and she feel a heavy weight press down on her, a force which also proceeds to choke her and seemingly to possess her Throughout this he wonders if they are really happening or if it is just a hallucination that she is experiencing. She leaves school and returns to live with her parents. She and her parents become convinced she is not epileptic or mentally ill but is possessed by demons. They ask for their local parish priest to be called in to perform an exorcism, and the Church agrees. This is a fantastic horror movie to watch, although i would recommend the film to older viewers because of the subject.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
107,fil-nik09,Quite good!,8,16 March 2016,"The exorcism of Emily Rose is quite a good film! As many have said before, it is probably the best film about exorcism after The Exorcist but it is just that I think it may very well be ( a bit) better.I like that the story of Emily is revealed step by step through the eyes of different people and from the distance. It kinda gives the authenticity to the film and the experience of the devil possession. Especially when we know that the film is based on the true story ! The girl who plays Emily is brilliant. The scenes were really 'exorcism worthy' especially those where her body is twisted in unnatural ways. Of course, I know that many special effects were probably used to convey that state of stiff possession, but her face expressions were on point with the body. All other actors in the film were on point with their roles.I wish that maybe the dark presence was much more exploited in the case of the defence lawyer or the priest. But maybe it would take an hour more to the story.All in all, I would recommend this film to horror/exorcism/supernatural lovers. Eight from me.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

A priest named Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is on trial for negligent homicide following the death of 19 year-old Emily Rose after he performed an exorcism on her in her family home. Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) is appointed as his defence. Father Moore won't accept any plea bargain. He does not care what happens to him, so long as Emily's story is told. Public prosecutor Ethan Thomas is seeking the maximum penalty, but he is the least of Father Moore and Bruner's problems, as the demonic forces which destroyed Emily are haunting this trial.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is very underrated. The cinematography, for starters, deserves praise. There are some gorgeous horror scenes. The opening shots of the frozen pumpkins outside the Rose house and the scenes of Emily walking through the fog, are excellent. The possession scenes are terrifying. Them black, dilated pupils were very well done. And the performances are superb. Jennifer Carpenter, Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney could not have been better.

But that's not what it set out to do. It set out to tell a true story and ask the viewer a few questions. Everybody in it is excellent on some level, with Laura Linney being the stand-out performance as is usual in most of her films. ""Rose"" is scary, intelligent and thought-provoking. Its dialogues are several notches above Hollywood films in general.

110,eshwarmail,"Intense, unbiased and compelling.",8,9 September 2012,"An excellent combination of courtroom drama surrounding the exorcism ritual and the supernatural forces along with equally potent acting. If observed closely, it is an unbiased portray of religious beliefs, superstitions, existence of God and Devil and the position of science on all this. Being based on a true story makes it more dramatic.The story is based on court trial where an ambitious lawyer Erin (Laura Linney) is defending the priest (Tom Wilkinson) who performed exorcism on Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) - a young, high spirited devout catholic. State charges the priest of negligence that led to Emily's demise, but he is ready to face and share the truth to the public on what actually transpired.What I liked most is that it is all left to perspective of different people how they perceive supernatural existence. On the account of the priest, Rose's family and Emily herself - the devil, the magic and the visuals are vivid. But on the accounts of those who are skeptical, the manifestations are purely coincidental which leaves the witness to perceive what they want to believe. When it comes to performances, they are convincing and apt. The exorcism and possession scenes are short and intense. Jennifer Carpenter's portrayal of Emily Rose converting from a young sweet girl full of life to a person suffering unbearable pain both physical and psychological is quite brilliant considering I would have never given her a chance from what I had seen her as Debra Morgan in Dexter. Not so much gore or visual gimmicks or cheap thrills.

The film is loosely based on the story of Anneliese Michel who under several Exorcisms, before she died from malnutrition. It's from that the film takes some inspirations from. They film is told through a serious of flashbacks as the court's determination the priest fate. This is a film that felt like it was unique for it's time with so many movies claiming having the word exorcism or Haunting or possession. This film manage to create a story center around a drama but still manages to incorporate horror to the mix.this isn't tour usual film of this category with good conquering evil and banish. As the story progress your constantly being shown through these flashbacks of what is occurred through the priests eyes as well as the family. It does really good in added that skepticism as the court try to debunk claims as the courts keep through science and psychology. Linney carrys her role well she at first really just what's to plead the case but as she spends more time diving into the case and things start to occur you can really see that she feels rather conflicted. You don't really know what's she believes in. Jennifer carpenter does an great job as Emily the ways she's able to move and contorted her body is cringe.

It has it's flaws, but overall it is a solid horror movie that balances the frightening night insanity with the peacefull daily reality perfectly. I love the transition changing the courtroom scenes with the actual exorcism moments which are as scary as they can get.

Father Moore faces life imprisonment for his activities trying to save the teenage girl's life.There are of course flashbacks to the actual possession and how it manifested itself and also the resulting exorcism ritual.Any film that deals with this topic will of course draw comparisons with The Exorcist and any film going up against the 1974 classic will ALWAYS lose.But The Exorcism of Emily Rose is passable even if it employs the broadest brushstrokes and whilst it may look great, there isn't a great deal of detail, nuance or depth to the events.If you flicked onto this whilst channel surfing this is perfectly enjoyable.

The screenplay is simply horrible, everything is wrong, horribly wrong, nothing works at all, no character development or anything of the kind. The performances are also generally horrible, particularly the usually brilliant Laura Linney as the lawyer who try's to defend the equally bad Tom Wilkinson, who is also usually a very good actor.

119,TheMovieMark,Your enjoyment of this movie hinges on your expectations,7,13 September 2005,"Expectations. Almost all of life's joys and disappointments hinge on expectations. If they're met we go home happy. If they're not met we go home frustrated. And if they're exceeded then we go home thrilled, and breakfast tastes just a little bit sweeter the next morning. If you've ever wondered why so many people set their standards low, well, it's so that they can't help but be exceeded. What is failure other than neglecting to meet expectations? Anyway, all that is a long-winded way of saying that your enjoyment of The Exorcism of Emily Rose will most likely correlate with your expectations. I think the marketing department made a mistake in trying to push this as a horror movie. As much (if not more) time is spent in the courtroom as it is on Emily Rose's supposedly possessed screams and contortions.If you're expecting and desiring straight-up horror and scares then those expectations will not be met. There are some creepy moments, but this really isn't all that frightening. Granted, movies don't scare me that easily. Typically, a walk at night in downtown Memphis is required to manage that. However, there was a guy behind me that started reciting ""The Lord's Prayer"" at one point. I don't know if this was an overreaction on his part and he was actually scared (wuss) or if he was just a moron who was trying to be cute. Either way, I never felt any sense of fear or dread.What I did feel was a genuine interest in the story and the courtroom proceedings. The movie is most effective when flashbacks are telling Emily Rose's story. I especially liked how the movie presented both sides of the case. In one scene we'll see things from the point of view that Emily is all demon-possessed and whacked out like she's Tom Cruise in love, and then we'll see the same scene from a medical/scientific viewpoint.But where the movie let me down was in the distortion of the real facts of the case. Yes, as the prologue tells us, this is ""based on a true story."" Those words should always have you reaching for your grain of salt (a necessary item at most movies these days). This should come as no surprise, but two minutes worth of research reveals that the case this is based on (the girl's real name was ""Anneliese Michel"" not ""Emily Rose"") bears little resemblance to the overly dramatic portrayal that the movie gives us.I know it's just a movie, but I couldn't help but be skeptical once everything started to get a little too coincidental. Something happens to a key witness, Laura Linney starts to see dark figures, we're falsely informed that there was only one exorcism and it took place on Halloween, Laura Linney starts to wake up every night at 3:00 AM. The priest tells the audience that this is significant because it's known as ""the demonic witching hour."" It's an inversion of 3:00 PM - one theoretical time of Christ's death. At this point I started to think, ""Oh come on, now THAT can't be part of the true story."" My skepticism started to become a distraction.Plus, it didn't help that I had, ""And she says baby, it's 3:00 AM I must be lonely!"" running through my head. Matchbox 20 lyrics always have a way of ruining a mood.But that's just a small complaint. I was disappointed when I got home, did some research, and found out that most of the movie's details regarding the possession and the priest's statements were indeed fictional and had nothing to do with the real case. My doubts were confirmed. I suppose you have to twist the facts and dramatize everything when you're trying to scare people, but I was hoping this would be a case where truth really was stranger than fiction. I convinced myself to expect that would *not* be the case, so my expectations were met and I went home happy. I was just hoping my Kroger brand cinnamon pop tart would taste sweeter the next morning. Oh well, maybe next time.THE GIST The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an entertaining movie as long as you get what you're expecting. I recommend you go in expecting a courtroom drama with horror elements and a fictional story with tidbits of truth and you should go home entertained. After all, joy and disappointment hinge on expectations, so sometimes it's best to have a good idea of what to expect.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
120,galensaysyes,Every which way but truth,4,11 August 2008,"This is a movie that keeps changing direction and stepping on its own feet as it does so. It tries to be The Exorcist AND Sybil AND Audrey Rose AND Inherit the Wind all in one. The attempt was hopeless, and anyway, the movie is in the wrong form. I'm surprised how many movies are, these days. This one should have been a courtroom drama, probably on a stage, with the events leading to the death described rather than shown, so that the each spectator could assess for himself the competing witnesses' reliability, envision what happened, and decide whether it was supernatural or not. The evidence would have to be balanced both ways, and credible enough either way to leave both believer and unbeliever less certain than they were at the beginning of what they believe. And the believers and the unbelievers all have to be operating from belief systems of sincerity and depth, and have to be able to articulate them. Otherwise, there can be no drama, just the noise of drama - which is what this movie is. The pretrial and trial scenes make a pretense at being serious drama but, apart from their artificiality, interrupt it at every possible point with flashbacks juiced up beyond acceptability in anything other than a horror movie. Not one line of dialogue or piece of casting is believable in the least; everything is phony and movielike and actorish, sometimes to the point of farce. Laura Linney, playing an ambitious attorney, is done up to look like a rag doll, while Emily Rose's fundamentalist family is straight out of Charles Addams. The director's infatuation with the movie ideas in his head evidently crowded out any thought of actually bothering to observe the kinds of people he was allegedly picturing.

Some details have been changed for the movie but the heart of the story remains Science takes on religion in a gripping court room throw down.Starring Jennifer Carpenter, now of ""Dexter"" fame, as Emily Rose a smart and centered farm girl who goes off to college only to be either suffering from a number of medical conditions or possessed by demonic spirits. This movie is stocked with a roster of very accomplished actors such as Tom Wilkinson as the accused Father Moore, Laura Linney as his attorney, and Campbell Scott as the prosecutor. The story is centered on the trial of Father Moore and uses flashbacks to tell the story of Emily Rose and the circumstances surrounding her death.The prosecution contends that Emily was suffering from something called psychotic epileptic disorder. Which would explain her hallucinations, her trance like states, and violent seizures. While Father Moore is a loving and caring priest with a perfect record did he willing put Emily at risk by ignoring her possible medical conditions and relying of faith alone? Father Moore does tell Emily to stop taking her medications because it clouds the mind and prevents the exorcism from working. When Emily dies the official cause of death is dehydration and malnutrition.Defense attorney Erin Bruner takes the case with the promise that she will be made a full partner at her firm. She is coming off a huge win in which she got off a another murder suspect. She meets up with Father Moore in prison an he refuses to take a plea deal, wanting it to go to trail to tell Emily's story (good thing or there wouldn't be a movie). Erin lives alone and after taking the case strange things start to happen every night at 3 am, the witching hour, leaving her to start examining her faith.The story investigates both sides of the case and each do have very good arguments. Science has been batting religion since the beginning of time and this movie doesn't give any easy answers. The acting is top notch and takes the issues seriously. It all depends on what you believe and goes to the core of faith itself. It is one of the better movies out there on the subject of demonic possession.

126,Spaceygirl,Brilliant and unsettling,8,11 June 2007,"""The exorcism of Emily Rose"" is one of the most creepily effective horror movies of recent years, elevated to brilliance only by the cast. Part horror, part Courtroom drama, the plot is a little contrived and hardly original but the acting by the usually excellent Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney is top-notch. The characters are fully fleshed out, unlike the cardboard cut-outs usually seen in horror movies, Laura Linney portraying to perfection her characters internal conflict between her agnosticism and her growing belief in the supernatural. Tom Wilkinson is just as effective as a clergyman caught between the Arch Diocese's instructions and his own convictions. The interaction between these two is electrifying. Jennifer Carpenter turns in a very effective role, veering between sweet and normal to terrifyingly possessed. The cinematography is a tour-de-force reminding me of Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"". The pace is more like an old-fashioned horror story, relying less on in-your-face jumps and more on a slow-burning tension which culminates in a terrifying flashback of the exorcism itself.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
127,Rathko,Crossing Genres Rarely Works,6,15 September 2005,"In 1973, Bill Friedkin and William Batty established a benchmark for cinematic possession that has endured for over thirty years. From the cracked and blistered skin to the unnatural bodily contortions, to the growling voices and the guttural foreign gibberish; our idea of what demonic possession looks like is based largely on the imagery created for that movie. Derrickson and Boardman's attempts to finally steer the possession genre in a different direction is a brave and commendable effort, which makes its ultimate failure all the more disappointing.The Director/Writer team, who have previously collaborated on such gems as 'Hellraiser:Inferno' and 'Urban Legends 2', simply don't have the experience or, it seems, the intelligence to successfully tackle the issues that they attempt to raise in 'Emily Rose'.The screenplay is separated into two story lines; a primary plot involving the trial of Father Moore, and a secondary plot, told in flashback, of Emily Rose's supposed possession. The courtroom drama could very easily have become a devastating look at the presence of 'real' evil in the world, and on several occasions, the screenplay threatens to do just this. Whether through the power exercised by the local church, or the political machinations of high-powered law firms, or Linney's realization that a previous client is killing again, each of these plot points could have been used to explore a far deeper level of the understanding of 'evil' than either the writer or director can theorize. When compared with the personal demons that Father Karris fights after the death of his mother in 'The Exorcist', the weakness of 'Emily Rose's emotional and intellectual core become all too apparent.Having created a primary storyline that refuses to explore the issues it raises with any degree of complexity or depth, we are left with the secondary storyline for entertainment. But whereas the primary plot is resolved in a climactic courtroom verdict, this secondary plot is left hanging in the air. The entire film, like some old-school straight-to-video monster movie, promises a final showdown in which we will see Emily looking all bog-eyed and demonic. When the film fails to show such a blatantly mandatory scene, the viewer can't help but feel cheated, and walks from the cinema feeling deflated and asking, 'Was that it?"" 'Emily Rose' had a lot of potential. It's original vision of possession works, and it manages to balance the fine line between real and hallucinatory with genuine skill. There are one or two scenes that are genuinely scary, and hint at what an effective and terrifying horror movie this could have been. But ultimately, the screenplay's inability to juggle drama with horror results in a movie that fails to bring the strengths of either genre to the screen. The drama simply isn't dramatic enough, and the horror is never allowed to become horrifying. A good attempt by all involved, but ultimately a disappointment.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
128,NerdBat,Not bad at all!,7,22 March 2018,"Probably the most horrific part of this movie is the fact that it supposedly did occur. I myself did some extensive research into the case (obviously names have been changed for the film). The movie really kept me glued to the screen. I rarely find modern horror films that can keep my full attention all the way through, but I really did enjoy this one. You feel bad for Emily, and at first you feel the Priest may truly be the one to blame, but through time you realize that...well, you can draw your own conclusions on what REALLY happened. It depends on your stance on belief in the paranormal, but as the priest's attorney mentioned, we should all keep an open mind. Definitely a must see!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
129,BreanneB,Just saw this movie yesterday!,8,25 September 2005,"I just saw this movie yesterday. The reason I give it 8 out of 10 stars is because although it was good, it could have been better. I think that the idea of showing so much of a courtroom and so little of the story when it happened was a cheesy idea.Emily Rose, has an exorcism and dies. The priest is then put on trial for murder. How could the jury convict him? How could they even bring him to trial? It just shows the errors of the justice system.In the end all I can say to the filmmakers is, the next time you wanna make a movie like this, try and make it more realistic. Even though this is a true story I'm sure a lot of it is slanted for reasons to make it extremely juicy.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Her priest believes she has been posed by the devil but doctors believe she has epilepsy. The movie then follows the trial after her death.

132,rcavellero,Reel evil,9,10 September 2005,"The Exoricism of Emily Rose is such a success on so many levels. Most of which graduate it's stellar cast and makers into Oscar worthy territory. Fabuolus Jennifer Carpenter of the less impressive White Chicks makes here real film debut here as the scariest possessed girl ever put on film(Linda Blair take a hike). She stars as Emily Rose a naive, quiet young girl in her freshman year at college. On a weekend alone she is supposedly attacked by demonic forces and becomes possessed. The film takes place in the aftermath of her failed exorcism and death. The Priest Father Moore played beautifully by Tom Wilkinson has been put away for her murder. Laura Linney gives her most powerful performance as his attorney whom is agnostic and questions his and her beliefs. The film doesn't lean in any particular direction and saves the big questions open for you to answer. It's been a long time since I've seen such an abdunce of talent and intelligence thrown into a horror picture. And don't be mistakened it is a horror picture and a scary one at that. What horror is on film is portrayed poetically and realistically and the courtroom scenes are played with the same pizazz. This will be the film to make everyone question their beliefs. What really happened to Emily Rose? Was she possessed? Or was it a medical Condition? Are their things such as demons? And god and the devil? Should we be scared? Well I have to say I'm leaning more towards yes after this movie. I went in as a non believer and came back questioning and wanting to reestablish my faith. Besides wonderful turns from the expected performers such as Wilkinson and Linney who should receive an Oscar nomination. Carpenter is a real find she's one hell of a screamer and with hardly any use of spfx she manages to look frighteningly possessed. A true breakout star making performance. The script is tight intelligent and wonderfully adapted. And the director whom is graduating from less respectable films such as Urban Legends: Final Cut and Hellraiser: Inferno makes quite an impression here and seems like he's been doing it forever. This should be a breakout hit from audience reaction and should garner a handful of awards from the fabulous work that was invested. So I dare you to go and question your beliefs and witness the exorcism of Emily rose. One of the best films of the year! ****1/2 (out of five)",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
133,skymovies,"The Exorcist, John Grisham-style",5,18 November 2005,"Acknowledged as an actual case of demonic possession by the Catholic church, this 'true' supernatural drama is rendered flat by pedestrian pacing and underdeveloped characterisation. Three parts courtroom blather to one part devilry, it would have benefited from less cross-examining and more head-spinning.""Only I can tell Emily's story"", pronounces Tom Wilkinson's accused priest as he demands to take the witness stand. But any one of half a dozen people present at the trial could have told her tale, and none of them were in trouble. (It's not giving anything away to say that 'Emily's story', as presented here, is essentially just a couple of eyewitness accounts and the reading of a letter).Much appears to have been glossed over and replaced with, well, not much. The special effects are low-key and quietly effective but they won't scare the pants off anyone. And the jerky visuals are at odds with the static trial scenes.Moreover, nothing comes of the things that go bump in the night at defence lawyer Laura Linney's house, Campbell Scott's prosecutor is a two-dimensional yawn, Emily's bumpkin clan are barely heard from and no explanations or theories are given as to why the demonic forces enter Emily in the first place. What satanic purpose might there be to killing a powerless country lass?As a courtroom drama, I have few objections. But as an account of an infamous and unsettling tale, I fail to see where this line of argument is leading.

The priest goes to trial where they presented creepy evidence yo the jury who are also told about odd circumstances. You can guess how it ends. All in all, I don't know why this movie was made.

135,spacemonkey_fg,Religious themed horror is back!,10,12 September 2005,"Title: The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005) Director: Scott DerricksonCast: Jennifer Carpenter, Tom Wilkinsonm, Laura Linney Review: It feels like its the 70s all over again. The 70s a time when religious themed horror movies spawned every other day. That decade saw the birth of such classics as as The Exorcist, The Omen and Rosemaries Baby. But like many Hollywood fads they deluded into a series of bad clichéd horror films that stopped being scary and turned funny instead. Now here comes the rebirth of the religiously themed horror movie in the form of The Exorcism of Emily Rose and I gotta say, I welcome the return of these themes with open arms.The story is based on the real life events of a young German called Anneliese Michel. A 19 year German girl who in 1976 died during an exorcism approved by the Catholic Church. The movie centers around the defense attourney Erin Bruner, who has to protect the rights of Father Moore the catholic priest who was performing the exorcism and who is now blamed for Emily's death. The movie explains the events leading to the exorcism in a series of flashbacks that are shown whenever a new witness is brought to the stand. So in other words, this is basically a courtroom movie with a horror twist.The interesting aspect of this film is the way the story is told. Right from the get go you know that Emily dies in the exorcism which gets you thinking, well, I already know how the movie is going to end, wheres the fun in that. Well the fun in this flick is not the what...but the how. How the events unfolded which lead to the horrible death that Emily suffered. So in spite of the fact that Emilys story is told through a series of flashbacks, the movie manages to be extremely interesting and gripping. With every chilling flashback more and more of the story is revealed right to its chilling conclusion.Now this movie isn't as flashy as perhaps The Exorcist and let me explain why. We all know the exorcist is famous for its over the top head spinning, spider like crawling, vomit spewing, floating above the bed antics. And that movie is great for those delivering us those shocks, but with Emily things are a bit more real. Those scenes of Emily possessed are frightening in their own way, but its just not as special effects oriented as perhaps The Exorcist was. And I think its because the events were not blown out of proportion simply for making a gee wheez special effects filled horror show. No, here the scares come simply because of the fact that these events could have occurred exactly as you see em on the screen. And believe me this movie gets to people, the audience I watched it with was on its tips and toes every moment of the way, the high pitched screams of the girls in the audience let me know that.But don't get the wrong idea, even though this movie isn't heavy on the razzle dazzle special effects, the exorcism/possession scenes are something truly amazing, and terrifying. From horribly contorted bodies to eating insects to speaking in unknown languages...Emilys possession is something frightening in deed.As far as performances go this one is out standing, Jennifer Carpenter has to mentioned because of her grueling tortured performance of a girl tormented, either by her mental condition or the demons she claimed possessed her. With out a doubt the performance that shines the most is hers. Tom Wilkinson and Laura Linney do their thing and its all good and great but Carpenter is the one who steals the show.The spooky factor is very high on this one. I'm guessing its because everyone can identify with these themes. Who doesn't think that their might be dark forces willing to screw with people, dark forces who might pull your bed sheets at night or make your life a living hell. This is the main reason why this movie keeps people at the edge of their seats. But for those of you who bend more to the scientific side of things, don't fret, this movie doesn't just show the supernatural side of things. It also dwells into the scientific and rational explanation of things. This is a movie that will satisfy both the skeptic and the believer. There's an ambiguity about the flick that balances things just perfectly, if this movie had a religious denomination it would be agnostic, like its main character attourney Erin Bruner.And I must say I really enjoyed that angle because in previous movies of this nature they make it seem as if everyone in the world is catholic and that their religious is the one an only true one. On this film its different because the main character is agnostic and even in one point of the film they bring an expert on exorcisms and she goes on about how this sort of thing happens in different religions all around the world, not just with catholics. So its a good thing that filmmakers were aware of this and made its story more accessible to everyone even those who aren't catholics.In conclusion, a great movie thats sure to spook you with its religious themes and a great performance from Jennifer Carpenter. A worthy addition into the ""religious horror"" shelf.Rating: 5 out of 5",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Scott Derrickson,the director of this film,approaches the viewer with a story that is very involving and with a cast that is amazingly put together.The story is as is.A priest(Tom Wilkinson)is being investigated for the death of a young girl whom he says was possessed.There are two sides to this film and those two sides are presented to us in such away that we are asked questions that are challenging to answer.I always believed that Emily was possessed.But that's me.The person next to me watching the film could think otherwise.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" isn't so much about demonic possession.It's about what we believe.Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson both give Oscar nominated deserving performances that strengthens the quality of this film.It's a good film and should not be looked upon as a film of horror because it is not.It is more psychological.Alright,I suppose you can also call it a horror film.""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a suspenseful film as it is a film that is very interesting.If you want to see a film about a girl possessed by demonic forces,watch ""The Exorcist"".That film directly approaches the topic of demonic possession while this film approaches its beliefs.One last thing.Jennifer Carpenter was wonderful in this film and even though the Academy may not nominate her for her performance,she should be.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
138,boyinflares,Are Demons Real?,10,24 November 2005,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is not your typical horror movie, that is to say it could almost be called a drama. That's not to say this film isn't horrific, it certainly is. The fact that it is a true story makes it even more so. What we are dealing with is not a revenge-seeking slasher, but real demons, which of course begs the question - are demons real? Hopefully by the end of the film, you will be able to decide that for yourself, or at least draw some thoughts from both arguments presented at the trial, which is taking place after Emily Rose's death, the People versus the Priest which performed the exorcism on her. The film flicks between the present, mostly set at the courthouse, or the past, specifically during Emily Rose's exorcism and the events leading up to it. The pace is evenly set, and there is never a dull moment as you find yourself touched by Emily's plight, but also following Erin Bruner, played by Laura Linney, who is the lawyer for the priest, and is a very sympathetic character.Linney is fantastic as per usual, Tom Wilkinson who plays the priest is very good, and Campbell Scott who speaks on behalf of the People puts up a good fight. JR Bourne is underused as Bruner's assistant, Mary Beth Hurt is solid as the Judge, and Shohreh Aghdashloo makes an appearance in a small role. The actors who play Emily Rose's family and boyfriend are all commendable.Be prepared for a few jump scenes, be prepared to open your mind to what may be new ideas, and be prepared to be drawn into the war between angels and demons in this splendid horror which boasts a great and chilling score, just as Laura Linney can boast to having great hair.

140,KingM21,Effective exorcising.,7,13 September 2005,"Well, this is one of best outings of the genre, regardless of rating, of the past couple years. Based on a true case that took place in the 70's (though many of the details have been altered or replaced), it's about a young lady who was either possessed by demonic forces or suffered something along the lines of psychotic epilepsy. She eventually dies and the state holds the priest that conducted the exorcism responsible. Enter the fairly compelling courtroom angle, which is really where most of this movie takes place, with flashbacks (from both points of view) of the events that brought us to this point. This is the creepiest movie thats come out in quite some time. Despite the rating, the ""thematic material"" is very strong (the unrated DVD adds very little to it). The segments of Emily Rose (played brilliantly by Jennifer Carpenter...watch her when she's talking to the priest after becoming stiff as a board and stood up!) being ""haunted"" and ""possessed"" is frightening stuff, sometimes subtle in nature (her chilling contortion on the floor) and sometimes not (the whole, hectic, hellish barn scene). Perhaps the best thing about all this is that for the most part, it feels fresh and not like it's a retread of The Exorcist. Also, I must say that the sound effect work here is top-notch. Christian horror director Scott Derrickson (the underrated Hellraiser: Inferno) brings the film together rather well for all the jumping back and forth, though I couldn't help but notice that Hollywood feel throughout, what with certain clichés, acting, and a number of ""jump"" scares (though some were cool and represented Emily's decline effectively).

I am sure there was a reason for the slow spots, though. The movie was not made to please those who love ""slasher"" style movies or ""special F/X"" techniques. This was an extremely well done movie that was all about the story. Believe me, this story will suck you in and spit you out when its done with you. You, too, will wonder if it is safe to leave.

The scenes, the flashbacks, the drama, the horror, the faith vs doubt theme ... all were entwined in a back-and-forth web that maintained constant focus on the strongest feature of all: the Story itself.And what a Story! I won't give it away except to say that the plots and subplots and intrigue and characterizations were all woven together to spin a simply riveting, terrifying, provocative, endearing, challenging Story.I really liked the multiple depictions of What Happens and How the Characters React. You see Something Happen; and then feel Fear; and then watch the Face of the Character on hand experience Fear; and then perhaps the order is slightly changed: you see the Face of the Character experience Fear as the Character gazes in terror over the viewer's shoulder. Then you see What the Character is looking at. And experience Fear.I also really liked the legal conflict ... and the way the Story honored both sides. There's no doubt, ever, where our sympathies lie: with the Laura Linney character. Yet, the prosecutor is not at all a ""straw man."" He is give a great opening, and is effective and believable throughout. This enhanced greatly the Doubt vs Faith conflict that reinforced the Story throughout.And through all this, the Priest's insistence that the Story should be told, is what really drove the action above all. This gave a feeling of authenticity to the Story that both made it appealing, and frightening.A wonderful, wonderful, movie ... !",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
145,commandercool88,Subtly Creepy,8,11 September 2005,"In a world where movies tagged with the pseudo brand 'based on a true story', it's easy to assume that a true story is the least of what was in the mind's of producers when the film was made. It's possibly what startled me most about the surprisingly non-beefed Hollywood tale of 'The Exorcisim of Emily Rose'.Emily Rose, 19, is a small-town girl with an apparent serene but sickly life. And when she receives a full-scholarship to her dream college, the world seems to open up to her. But as fate would have it, Emily is soon divulged into a dark world where she finds herself isolated from the rest of the world. She believes herself to be possessed by demons. She experiences disturbing paranoid hallucinations, contorts her body in impossible ways and screeches and snarls in subtitled Aramaic. Even when her family calls upon the help of their preacher, Father Moore, to oversee an exorcism of the girl, nothing seems to cure the girl. And after her death, the preacher stands trial, charged with neglect that resulted in Emily's untimely death. Was Emily truly possessed by demons, or could her condition have been explained simply by epilepsy and psychosis? It's a subject that's heavily dealt with in the film. Can a person truly be possessed, or is science the answer? When we see things through Emily's point of view, it suggests that she was in fact victim to a demon(s). And with the entire film taking place within the courtroom trial (flashbacks are used to tell the story of Emily), it gives the audience views of both sides and allows the truth to be held by the eye of the beholder. It allows an interesting and thought-provoking take on a divisive and controversial issue.Top-notch and amazingly casted, 'Emily Rose' has all the right ingredients working for it. Led by the Osacr-nominated Laura Linney, she portrays an agnostic attorney who finds herself reluctantly defending the case, but eventually becomes emotionally attached and affected as she comes to question her beliefs, or lack there of, adding some hefty weight to the film. Tom Wilkinson is the accused and devastated Catholic priest who is able to come into his own. Newcomer Jennifer Carpenter more than warrants acknowledgment, conjuring a terrifying performance and enabling herself to contort into otherworldly positions.Co-written and directed and by Scott Derrickson, the film approaches the issue very seriously. Its set-up doesn't allow a surge of scares and scary situations, but that's not to say that there weren't a few authentic and solid scares along the way. A sequence in which Emily's boyfriend awakes to find a jolting discovery will be one to remember for quite some time. It's these early subtle shocks, body contortions and seizure attacks and demonic apparitions, that pack the most weight before the film ventures into the many clichés of the genre. It's whats refreshing about the film, though. It's good old-fashioned film-making, which relies on lighting, sound, and camera angles rather than the preposterous CGI effects that doom many of today's horror flicks. You never find yourself entering the movie world of spinning heads and green vomit, the film grounds itself in the natural world. It's a welcome treat, and something that does in fact up the level of horror and atmosphere. It (finally) realizes that what you don't see is often much more frightening than anything that can be seen.'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' also dodges another bullet with its undeniable range of intelligence. Much of the film's success can be attributed to the intense and extensive trial sequences. The 'Law & Order' like set-up may be a first for the genre, but it's the heart of the film. It provides some serious entertainment, and perhaps a satisfying breather in between flashback sequences.It could have been a great film, but this well-acted court room drama still succeeds in sending a chill down your spine and leaving a lingering impression. 'The Exorcisim of Emily Rose' is an intelligent sleeper suspense that delivers when it's appropriate without becoming a nuisance or over-staying its welcome (if you are the one to welcome demonic possessions, that is). It may not be the film that was advertised on television, it's probably better. It could be one of the better films of the year. It could. What you're left with is a perplexing and intriguing film that provokes questions rather than answering them. If you're a fan of the genre, 'Emily Rose' is well worth the price of admission.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
146,toll-8,Don't be fooled by the title or cast. This is not a good movie!,2,6 March 2012,"Most people would avoid watching this film, mainly for the fact that the word exorcism is in the title. That word holds many connotations towards the devil but if anything most will think of the banned film The Exorcist. I can assure you now The Exorcist this is not.The Exorcism Of Emily Rose is the story about, well the exorcism of Emily Rose. At the beginning of the film we are made aware that she has died during an exorcism performed by Father Moore (Wilkinson). The Doctor on duty that night has then told the police that the death was not caused by natural causes, so Father Moore is arrested on suspicion of murder and later charged for negligent manslaughter. The story un folds with Father Moore on trial for the manslaughter, defended by a non-believing lawyer Erin Bruner (Linney). Moore is told to take a plea and get off with a shorter sentence but he announces that he is not in it to reinstate his reputation, he just wants to tell Emily's story.As the trial unwinds, Emily's story is told through flashbacks. The prosecution are adamant that Emily suffered from epilepsy, the cause of her seizures, or psychotic behaviour, the reasons for her aggressive out bursts. On the other hand the defence are trying to persuade the jury that in fact it was all the work of the devil and that Father Moore was attempting to save Emily as opposed to killing her. The entire story is played out via the courtroom with the flashbacks taking us away from it and other minimal scenes from the present. This is one of the major problems with the film.As I said at the top, people will consider this to be like The Exorcist. Ever since that film, the word alone is enough to send shiver and intrigue down someone's spine. This film however will send nothing down your spine what so ever. The film has as much scares within it as the titles of The Exorcist did. Not once was I frightened and not once was I cowering away like I was when watching Linda Blair's head spin around. I know I shouldn't be judging this based on a film made decades before, but the film will bring these connotations because of that one word alone, and using that one word in your title means you have a lot to live up to.Some courtroom drama films can be brilliant. Many are tense due to the acting and camera work, and others tell an intriguing story. This courtroom drama fails to do either. Not once were the scenes tense, and the direction seemed to be lacking. The acting was below par, especially for the talent on show, Wilkinson especially seemed uninterested and like he was only reading the words off the page and the two lawyers (Linney & Scott) were unbelievable as characters with so much power. The whole part in the courtroom, which was most of the movie, just didn't feel like a real trial. The Judge looked and acted like she was half asleep, and every single bout of questioning ended with an 'objection' cry, followed by 'no further questions'. Every single time! The camera work within the courtroom was also as if it was made for a cheap television channel and not a feature length film starring crowd pleasing actors.Rambling on about the courtroom is boring now, and with a film titled how it is you would not expect to be bored by courtroom drama, but I'm afraid in this film you will. It just plods along with nothing really happening, and every now and again we will get a flashback to Emily seeing people's faces turn to demons. This was not really showing you the exorcist but the aftermath and, unless I'm missing the point, it did not work.The exorcism scenes were alright but they were too and far between, and I was surprised at the end to see the family so involved with the exorcism but voiceless in the rest of the film. Would they not have something to say about the whole thing? The film just rolls over several key issues and eventually stumbles onto a poor, cheesy, unconvincing climax. By the end I was uninterested.The film failed to keep me entertained, and in fact at times failed to keep my concentration. It is not a film to watch if you want thrills and it isn't one to watch if you want tense courtroom drama. It seems to be the wrong story to be told via courtroom. It is based on a true story and perhaps that is the selling point, but after watching it I have realised that I don't really care, and whatever you say I will not believe demons exist. 1 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

148,heckles,"How this movie is different from ""The Exorcist""",4,2 January 2006,"(Some spoilers ahead) This movie is different from ""The Exorcist"" in the same way ""King Kong"" is different from a movie that seriously postulates that giant apes and dinosaurs exist on a remote island. A movie that simply takes a horror scenario based on old legends and runs with it, is distinguishable than one that argues that the horror scenario can actually happen.To this day I do not know if either William Blatty or William Freidkin are religious believers. I do know that they created a rattlin' good film back in 1972, one that you do not have to be a religious believer to enjoy. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have been written by a Mel Gibson type Catholic who believes that the Church is all that stands between a skeptical humanity and the unlimited resources of hell, which stand ready to very visibly put the smack down on the planet.If this movie wanted to be taken seriously, it could address a few questions that any skeptic could compose. What, for instance, is the whole point of demonic possession? If Satan is, as the Bible describes him, a master of deceit, why would he ever want to come out in the open like that? And why on earth would he want to possess a simple, obscure farm girl? Why not take over, say, the President of the U.S.? Or the Pope? Now if I were the Prince of Darkness, that is who I would go for. Billions would be impressed. Some might believe the Pope is too saintly for that, well, so was Emily.Two problems with courtroom procedure: first, the prosecutor shows a picture of the mutilated Emily in his opening argument. Erin should have objected. Opening statements are when the state tells the jury about the evidence - not when the evidence is actually presented. Erin's summation, too? She states ""I know Fr. Moore, and he is not a bad man."" She is testifying about the character of the defendant, and the state should have objected. (What she is really saying is, ""You, the jury, can't convict a priest."" I heavily disagree.)",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
149,Pasafist,The Worst Episode of Law and Order Ever,1,9 September 2005,"When dealing in matters of faith many people tread lightly. Sometimes it because we want to be sensitive and not offend. Other may fear that their agendas may air on the side of propaganda rather than inspiration. In the case of THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE I believe the film makers committed an even bigger sin, they made a film that was just plain stupid.When young Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter, Whit Chicks) went off to college she thought all her dreams were coming true. That is until the six demons climbed into her body, one claiming to be Lucifer himself. The medical community thinks she may have epilepsy and so they put her on meds. Her parish Priest Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson, In The Bedroom) suggests a higher form of intervention and performs and exorcism on her. Now Emily Rose is dead and it's up to a hotshot Lawyer (Lauren Linney, You Can Count On Me) to defend Father Moore's actions and to keep him out of jail.Director and Co-Screenwriter Scott Derickson (Hellraiser:Inferno) claims to have invented the first Horror/Courtroom Drama. I think he's right, and after sitting through this film I know why it took so long for it to happen. It doesn't work Not only because you cannot stop and think for one moment that this is how a courtroom is run. But mostly because you're not quite sure why Father Moore is up on the stand and not the doctor (Duncan Fraiser, The Claim) who was checking her vitals the whole time, Emily's Father, and/or Emily's Boyfriend who were all there at the scene of the crime . They were all present and did nothing to stop it. Why the heck do you only charge Father Moore with the crime? If you go to this movie thinking it's a horror film your seriously mistaken. It's more like the worst written episode of Law and Order you've ever seen. Courtroom cliché's abound, even a minor character who can shed light on the situation is bumped off. Why? Well for once it was an accident, or was it an act of God? The plot thickens, okay not really.The sad part is that there could have been a compelling movie here. Emily Rose's story could have been fascinating. But alas for a film in which the Father Moore spouts out a half dozen times ""I need to tell Emily's story."" We only scratch the surface of who Emily Rose was? Why was she possessed? I can't for one moment believe it was for the half-baked and silly reason the film claims. What was she like before she went to college? Except for on old house full of cats and parents whom I might consider a little odd the film never delves into that.Instead of telling Emily's story the film focuses on a trail that is so convoluted and silly that I almost burst out laughing. The final argument for Father Moore's innocence is that ""There are No Facts Only Possibilities."" Give me a break, what kind of numb-skull logic is that? Did Linney's character get a law degree off the back of a fortune cookie? That's not to say their aren't some redeeming qualities to the film. Lauren Linney and Campbell Scott (The prosecutor) do a tremendous job with a half baked script, and while he should probably stick to directing Scott Derrickson shows that he could make a nice moody Horror film if given the right material.THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE misses the mark so badly its pretty much unredeemable. It's almost a shame because you can tell that a great many minds worked hard to make a film that asked us to explore our faith ""with fear and trembling."" Next time forget platitudes and try to tell a good story. Because good intentions, with poor plotting and sloppy story telling make a joke of any message you might try to foist on your audience.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
150,timhayes-1,fascinating,7,5 March 2007,"As the trailer made it out to be, I went into The Exorcism Of Emily Rose expecting to see an Exorcist rip-off. In some ways it provides just that. What I did not expect was that the bulk of the film be concerned with the trial of the priest brought up on charges for her death due to his performance of a failed exorcism and denial of medical attention. Really, this film is more concerned with the courtroom than it is with scaring the crap out of you. That gives it a fresh edge in the world of filmed demonic possession. All scenes regarding the actual exorcism and Emily's hallucinations of demonic forces are presented as flashbacks told by those testifying in court. The film itself takes neither the scientific nor religious side in the case and instead leaves the viewer to decide based on the facts given. Was Emily really possessed? We will never know. There are certainly some strong facts that would suggest it. On the other hand, there are also facts to support the theory that she was mentally ill and what she saw and did were parts of her condition. At any rate, it is up to the viewer. The film merely tells the story; you have to make up your own mind what side you wish to believe.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
151,ghoulieguru,Not Guilty,7,16 January 2006,"You know, I didn't go see this movie in the theater because everything that I had heard about it led me to believe that it was essentially the Ally McBeal Halloween Special. I wish that I hadn't listened to the haters and actually gone to see this movie on the big screen, because I ended up enjoying it on DVD. My hesitance to see the movie came primarily from the fact that I knew that about half of the movie took place in a courtroom. But what seems like a completely unworkable concept, a courtroom drama with a demon, actually ends up being a fairly effective and creepy horror movie. The Ghoulie Guru Jury finds the Exorcism of Emily Rose Not Guilty of being a bad movie.The only parts that don't work in this movie are the courtroom scenes. I don't like courtroom dramas, and this one has all the clichéd moments. The impassioned speeches from the defense, the surprise witnesses, the whole bit. I don't like movies where you spend 90 minutes waiting for the verdict to be passed down by the jury. But, if you can get through the courtroom scenes, there are some great moments in this movie. I can't help but think that this movie would have been so much scarier if it had been linear. Most of the scariest scenes are told in flashback, which takes away all their venom. I already know that the priest survives the scary exorcism scenes because he's the one telling the story. It's the same thing that crippled the Exorcist prequel. We all know that Father Merrin survives, so why should we be scared? However, if they had told the story linearly, then the whole structure would have been even stranger. You would have had 45 minutes of a scary movie and then 45 minutes of a courtroom drama. As it is, mixing the two up seems to be the only way to really make this movie work.In the end, I wound up liking this movie a lot more than I thought I would. I also think it's a better demonic possession movie than either of the Exorcist prequels. The scenes of Emily when she's possessed are almost as scary as some of the better moments from the original Exorcist. I also like the fact that the movie grounded the idea of demonic possession in medical fact, a bit like the old 70's movie THE ENTITY. It's not a perfect horror movie, because the courtroom scenes really do drag the thing to a grinding halt every time, but this is a solid rental for fans of the genre and might be worth adding to your collection if you can't get enough of the demon possession movies.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
152,eonbluedan-1,An entertaining shoulder shrug,6,1 June 2014,"Nowadays, how loosely based upon facts a story can be to warrant the title card, ""Based on a true story"" is hugely debatable, and so it is with 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' that the actual events may well have been twisted and exaggerated as the tale was passed on; certainly whilst watching it, we can't help but feel a reasonable amount of license taken for dramatic effect. Nevertheless, much like 'The Exorcist', to which it owes quite a debt in its clinical delivery, the tale, truth aside, remains pretty compelling.Indeed, director Scott Derrickson deals well in the drama of horror, rather than just the easy-to-reach clichés of the genre. He would later go on to prove himself keen on story and mood over simple shocks with 'Sinister', but with both films, he is at his weakest when having to deliver the more obvious horror element, playing his hand far too heavily.This movie has a good cast and keeps you gripped, for the most part. Whilst dealing in the low-key legal side of events, it is a genuinely interesting piece of work; it is a shame that the finale turns it into an almost apathetic shoulder shrug, quickly forgotten when in fact it should be keenly discussed.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
153,terrible2,Spine-Chilling / Creeped me out...,8,29 December 2005,"Kudos to Scott Derrickson, a recent director on the scene who has obviously watched some classic and cult horror films. Too many new (so called) horror films use the same formula, which doesn't work at all (see ""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"" and any other pretend horror flick made in the past few years), they all suck, and need to take some lessons from this film. I can honestly say that ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" sent chills up my spine, and that hasn't happened since the original ""Exorcist"". If not for the (boring) courtroom drama, this movie would be an instant classic. The horror scenes are well shot, and tend to bring the viewer into the room (not a pleasant place). I even jumped a few times and that never happens to me. The acting is excellent by Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Jennifer Carpenter is sensational as Emily Rose, I haven't been that creeped out by an actress since Linda Blair.

155,andell,Possession or Epilepsy? Hollywood always opts for drama.,7,11 September 2005,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"" I found them disturbing, and a bit scary. I myself tend to be a bigger horror fan: I found a movie like ""The Others"" to be well made if not a bit short on scares and a bit boring; movies like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" are just juvenile to me, for I have yet to find the fear in either of them. I passed on ""Dark Water"" just because I got fed up trying to find out what I should be afraid of in it.However I can say I have the distinction of finding ""The Exorcist"" to be a very chilling movie: so when this movie came out, I wasn't sure I would watch it. Well today, I yielded, and I must say, I was surprised at the outcome.No matter what you read here, the movie does have some genuine scares in it, and while many of them appear in the trailer, not all of them do. Moreover, it is true that it appears as though the story of Annaliese Michel, which was the 'truth' behind Emily Rose, in fact seems to have been tailored to meet the needs of the filmmakers. This is unfortunate.To their credit, the film makers keep you guessing. A credible case for the onset of Emily's condition as being psychotic epileptic disorder is made very well; conversely, the defense manages to put together a compelling case from an anthropological/psychiatric side of the equation that in fact demonic possession was the cause of Emily's condition. Emily may have learned all of the languages she speaks while ""possessed,"" or it may be in fact proof that she was possessed. Indeed, right up until about the last 30 minutes, the viewer is left wondering if in fact Emily was epileptic, or if she was possessed.For me, the movie weakens considerably when it makes the mistake of taking the decision away from the viewer, and leaving us with a note in which ""Emily's story"" is fully told, and this chapter of Emily's life can expire. In truth, Emily as a character is so vague that we know her better from the terror she feels and the demon inside of her than we do from anything she does. She chooses not to go hand in hand with the Virgin Mary and be spared her pain: why? Because she is pious? We know her home appears rather puritanical, and her family is rural, but aside from also knowing she wanted to be a teacher and is smart, there really isn't anything else about her that we know. Except that she must choose pain to support the will of the Almighty.That's Hollywood: the drama and the heroism of the young woman must somehow prevail, even when it seems that she really was on the losing side of things. And of course, the Jury's recommendation is more or less like washing their hands of having to decide: yet another weakness.For me, the movie is compelling, and it is interesting, and it is scary as well. It fails in some ways, and really succeeds in others- however do everyone a favor and keep any kids under, say, 14 at home. This isn't the material for them to watch.7/10 from me on this one!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
156,cwrdlylyn,EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE : Courtroom Drama Spiced Up With Some Terrifying Moments,8,25 April 2006,"THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE It's rare that I am ever genuinely scared by a movie. I've watched many classic horror films and been entertained, but hardly thrilled by them. The only film I've ever seen that really terrified me and stuck with me afterwords was THE EXORCIST, so I was nervous my cynicism and affection for that classic would make me view EMILY ROSE as a mere imitation. However, I was wrong.THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE has a few similarities to the 1972 classic, but it does more then enough to make itself stand alone as an effective, taut thriller. It tells the story of the trial of Emily Rose (played brilliantly in a brutally physical performance from Jennifer Carpenter), a young girl who either died from possession or from the poor advice of her priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson).Father Moore is being defended in the trial by Erin Bruner (played by Laura Linney), a lawyer who doesn't believe in the world of Angels & Demons. During the trial, Emily Rose's story is told and the idea of Exorcism is explored from many angles; scientific, religious, medical, etc.Mostly the film focuses on the trial, and it makes for an intriguing courtroom drama. The courtroom scenes do have their share of flaws though, particularly a melo-dramatic performance from Campbell Scoot as the opposing attorney. However, the different reasonings given to justify a spiritual case are quite interesting.However, most people are going to see this movie to be scared... and despite the fact that most of the focus is in the courtroom, EMILY ROSE delivers such a wallop in it's frightening scenes that it manages to appeal to both audiences. The scenes of Emily's possession are shown in flashback, and for me, spacing these scenes out gave me just enough time to calm down between scares. Here, as opposed to in THE EXORCIST, we are really shown the act of the possession... the physical action of the demon entering her, her physical decline as she is taken over. It's all shown in graphic detail, but these scenes are made shockingly real thanks to Jennifer Carpenter.I thought the courtroom element would leave me bored, however, it actually ended up making a nice framework for an intelligent and frightening film. The only thing I didn't like were the melo-dramatic performances from Colm Feore and Campbell Scott as men who are too jaded by their ""system of law"". These men should have taken some notes watching Laura Linney, who manages to both embrace her character's cynicism while also fusing her with honest humanity. However, nevertheless, EMILY ROSE provided just the right amount of thrills for me, and is one of the most frightening (though flawed) films I've ever seen.... B+ ...",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
157,evilmatt-3,"Not a horror film, but something better",9,10 September 2005,"Okay. The game's up. Despite what you've seen on TV, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is not really a horror film. Approximately half of the film has elements of what are best described as horror, but the other half is mainly a legal drama with heavy theological and ethical implications. It's not really not a horror film any more than it's a film on legal ethics, a subject to which the film devotes almost as much time as demonic possession.Make no mistake, though: this is a great film, and will be recognized and remembered in the way very few films are. Kurosawa's Rashomon was groundbreaking in its own moral and philosophical musings, and until now, the potential of that film has never been explored.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is the next logical step after Rashomon- that is, a film which explores the nature of truth and moral responsibility in the subjectivity of human experience through the blending and clash of two disparate movie genres: a horror film and a legal thriller. The Exorcism of Emily Rose, rather than being part of either of these genres, uses them to illustrate the absurdity of our search for truth (or in the case of a homicide, an explanation).Whereas the characters at the end of Rashomon despaired that they would never know the truth of a murder, this film wisely suggests that perhaps, in the end, obtaining an explanation is not the point. It suggests that truth may in fact be something deeper and less tangible, which a hard-nosed insistence on the ""facts"" cannot hope to touch.In year of one disgustingly bad film after another, this is the best by far.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
158,FilmFan777,Better than expected,8,10 September 2005,"The trailer can be a bit misleading. Once I knew more about it before seeing it, I think that helped.So in a nutshell... This is based on a true story from Germany about a girl who's parents believed she needed an exorcism. In the course of it, she died and the priest conducting was charged with negligent homicide and put on trial in responsibility for her death.Go in knowing this comes more from the court proceedings and the relationship between the defense lawyer (Linney) and the priest (Wilkinson)(whom both do an excellent job), peppered with flash backs of not only how the priest and family believed events unfold, yet at times from the description of the prosecuting attorney,(campbell scott who also delivers an exceptional supporting performance),which adds a flavored perspective.Scary? Hardly a hint of CGI and no real special effects HOWEVER... that was part of the beauty! My skin crawled more in this film then... I can remember last. And good ol' fashioned crawls too! Mainly due bringing back some of the old story telling without all the special gizmo's (hey, I luv em, but didn't miss em here for a second). Simply the situation itself, with some good drama, character depth, and good acting that helped put you there and made you fear when actual fear is pretty hard to come by in theaters today. And an honorable mention for Jennifer Carptenter who played Emily Rose. Not relying on special effects and over animated camera work, she made you feel her possession through her facial and physical expressions which really helped sell the fear factor in this film.So all in all, if it interests you in the least, go into it thinking a court room based drama with flashbacks of events, and I believe you'll come out enjoying it a bit more.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
159,persian-belle,A Greatly Misunderstood Film,1,7 January 2017,"Not a horror film, but an excellent film.A debate between science and religion In my opinion, this film is one of the great ones. Of course that depends on your philosophy and beliefs. I am an agnostic, meaning I am not at all affiliated with any religions but I like to keep an open mind about the those phenomena that are still unexplained to humans.I am also a fan of science and well-read in psychiatry and clinical psychology. While definitely not a fan of any man-created religion, I do keep an open mind about what could be on the other side.As a horror film fan, I had been waiting to watch this film. I admire Shohreh Aghdashloo (although she was given a small role here) and didn't know Jennifer Carpenter at the time. I was at first disappointed because I was expecting typical horror entertainment. However I realized that although there are a few creepy scenes, these are mostly realities that many schizophrenics have to deal with often. Many of them live this in their crises when they hallucinate, become delusional, etc. It's such a patient who is the most scared, not those who observe her. The film shows us how scary it is for her.Now the question remains, whether this is a mental illness or has roots in ""Evil"", as defined by the Christian tradition. During the entire time the viewer is searching for this answer, and at the it remains open-ended, thus giving much credit to science and psychiatry (explaining that in this modern age there should be medical intervention) but at the same time leaving the door open for the paranormal.I admired Jennifer Carpenter after this film. She usually does not play the role of the typical Hollywood glam girl who are dime a dozen. This girl can act. If you have seen the Dexter series, you will know what I mean. All the actors are great.

The colours, the musical score, and (surprisingly) muted and in-obvious special effects work very well indeed.The other genre is the courtroom drama. Based on actual happenings, the writer does not waste time trying to look at which side is right. The perennial problem of faith and doubt is examined. Examined in a way where ""evidence"" is presented. The audience, like the jury, must weigh up the matter.Laura Linney as the defendant is well-cast. She gives her character the right blend of authority contrasted with confusion. The dignity she brings to Erin is excellent. Likewise Tom Wilkinson, as the accused neglectful priest. Campbell Scott, as a church-going ""believer"" is impressive as the prosecution. At no time does the film approach the TV courtroom drama genre.

162,KillerLord,A Horror Movie With Class!,10,20 September 2008,"Most horror movies are designed to be cheap thrillers. The usual rise of the evil followed by an apparent demise! But time and now comes a movie that weaves the genres of horror and drama so beautifully that our notion of the horror genre is proved wrong. This movie stands out in that class along with The Exorcist, The Ring, Shutter, etc. This movie is not just another horror movie but has a significant element of thought, drama and emotion. The movie is based on a true story about Emily Rose who suffered from the symptoms of possession. A major part of the movie takes place in the courtroom where Father Moore, who carried out the exorcism of Emily Rose has been charged with negligent homicide. The battle explores the incident as recollections by the witnesses. The horror and supernatural element of the movie comes in as the witnesses describe the events of how Emily started feeling an alien force taking control of her. And how well handled is this, you will surely appreciate when you see this movie. No blood and gore! No unnecessary violence. Simple yet effective shots that do enough to scare you and yet not nauseate you so that your mind does not get distracted from the interesting debate on faith, superstition and science that is unfolding itself in the courtroom. The whole debate in the courtroom really brings out the role of faith in our lives. Be it the opinion of a religious leader or that of a medical professional, the eventual outcome of a treatment rests on faith. The common man has to show faith both in the religious advice doled out by the priests and also on the medical advice. One may argue that the medical advice was given based on scientific evidence. But who has seen the evidence? The professionals alone! They have an understanding and an experience based on which they give their opinion. But who can say that religious leaders are wrong? They can also argue that they have trained themselves to experience the things they talk about. This sort of sums up how the courtroom debate revolves around the issue of faith. The movie moves forward in a controlled fashion. It does not try to be too scary and neither does it try to work without a base and a plot. It combines both in an optimum way and keeps the movie viewer interested. In my opinion, it is among the most intelligently done movies in the horror/exorcism genre.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Yet, the movie did not really cover the above. The audience of the movie is led to believe that Emily Rose was actually demonically possessed. The lawyer (defending the priest) seems to work towards the validation of demons and possession.

Obviously, the first thing to do when watching this movie is to completely forget about that ""real"" apparatus that is thrown in our face and take it as the interesting work of art it is. Now, it is almost impossible not to establish the almost unavoidable parallel with The Exorcist, yet it should be noted that Emily Rose is more concerned with giving several interpretations to the possession phenomenon that going for the pure onslaught of satanic presence as its thematic sire does.In fact, the possession is displayed with tact and more through the use of intense acting and strong imagery than through any shocking acts, those that do occur are fairly spaced and cannot be said to form the body of the narrative. The movie tries a smart and sensible compromise between the purely rational and the drama that surrounds a religious experience.***Spoiler***The fact that we already know, from the start, that Emily has died withdraws a certain tension from the movie but adds something in terms of a psychological drama, as we weave our way through the last days of the character's life, showing her a person and not merely as an ultra Christian girl.***End Spoiler***Handling the matter with some discretion, the movie never becomes spectacular and its fatal flaw as the way in which it tries to set itself on a judicial arena- a place where such matters as demon possessions cannot be met with any approval. The premise becomes ludicrous, a mockery of itself, completely jesting at the courts without trying to do so. ***Spoiler***Another interesting and original aspect to this movie is the way it tries to give a purpose to the whole possession, it is not a random act of malevolence but it entails a deeper message, and to make sure that same message gains its full meaning, it requires the full acceptance of the sufferer. The scene in which Emily talks with the Virgin Mary, who is never seen or heard, in the misty fields at the bleak hour of a gray morning is amazing in that it shows a conscious choice that assures that the all the pain and strife served a greater goal. It is also a beautifully shot piece of imagery, reminiscent of the Virgins Suicides in its dream-like allure.***End Spoiler***All in all, it was interesting, at times great, a nice albeit flawed effort.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

169,patlightfoot,Thought provoking,7,25 March 2006,"I thought the court room arguments were convincing. A very thought provoking movie, whether one is religious or not. And the final judgement was a just one, I thought. Tom Wilkinson is one of my favorite English actors, he is very convincing in any role he plays. How true was it though? Emily was originally inspired by an exorcism done in Germany, and the writer of the book admitted that 'Emily' was epileptic and was not possessed by Lucifer or demons, but thought she was?Well - that changes things doesn't it? Had she suffered epilepsy before she went to University, or was this a sudden new disorder she developed? Arguments can be raised, that a sudden attack of a Grand Mal, could have been initiated by the reality of a demonic possession. That was thought provoking for sure.I do believe there are two external spiritual forces that can affect the human psyche. Creative (positive - good) or Destructive (negative - evil?)But only those who believe or accept the reality of demonic possession could believe or rationalise Emily's demise. Most of us would be labeled as mentally insane, despite rational episodes.I personally think that 'Emily Rose' was a mentally and spiritually disturbed young lady. And the sudden removal from a possible repressive yet protective, overly God-fearing and Roman Catholic upbringing came as a shock to her senses and moral conscience. When she became convinced she was possessed by demons, when in reality she was confronted by the alleged freedom and choices for the first time in her life rather than being controlled. Goodness, she may have developed schizophrenia, or had be given acid or some other hallucinatory drug that destabilised her brain chemicals.Incidentally when I watched this film, I felt I smelt burning too? That was purely psychological. Whatever was the truth, the court arguments were great, and I didn't find it warranted the genre of horror. The original 'Exorcist'& 'The Omen' were far more frightening I thought.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
170,johnmbale,At Last an Intelligent Horror Film,10,7 November 2005,"Was pleasantly surprised by this film, went not expecting anything more than a rehash of The Exorcist or maybe The Amityville Horror, but it was a well acted and intelligent story, using a court case as the structure to examine the results of a failed exorcism that causes a young girls death. Supposedly based on a such a case in Bavaria in the 70's, it places blame on the Priest, Father Moore for allowing the girl to quit medication for epilepsy, and cause herself bodily harm. He is charged with negligent homicide. Told in flashbacks from this court case, the actual exorcism is predictably lurid, though perhaps not as over the top as some previous films. Jennifer Carpenter as Emily makes the most of her physically demanding role. Yet finally it is the court room scenes that capture your interest, thanks to the acting of the three main characters, Tom Wilkenson particularly convincing as the unfortunate Father Moore, Laura Linney as Erin Bruner the Defense Council, and Campbell Scott Prosecuting. The verdict comes as a shock, and the whole case poses a rather fascinating problem. In some ways this film is more frightening and disturbing than the original Exorcist, and certainly 3. a.m. will never be the same again.

171,Surecure,Maybe would be an above-average movie of the week,6,28 September 2005,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose features strong performances from the two female leads -- Jennifer Carpenter and Laura Linney -- and effective direction, but offers little more. The script contains far too many holes to be completely forgiven and does contain some rather disappointing performances from several of the supporting cast. Even Tom Wilkinson (whom I am a fan of) delivers a performance that is hit and miss: he provides strength to many scenes but also detracts from others.The two largest problems with the film reside in a weak script. Firstly, the prosecutor is introduced as a religious man, though this element is completely unused in the film. It was an excellent angle to add to the film and would have elevated the drama, but instead it is used as a throwaway addition.The second largest problem comes from the introduction of a doctor who witnessed the exorcism. While the film builds itself up as an attempt to offer both sides as equals and allow the audience to think it through for themselves, the deck is artificially stacked in favour of the religious side by entering a source to completely discredit the scientific side in the audience's mind in such a way that it will not change the outcome of the trial. It almost seems like the writer has approach avoidance on keeping a completely balanced view.While the film does achieve an excellent feeling of unease and suspense, it ultimately fails to live up to the promise made in being such a unique perspective on religious suspense with a strong cast. While it is indeed a unique film and possesses strong performances, it fizzles out and does not make itself to be more than just movie of the week quality.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
172,Roger_Sterling,Pleasantly surprised,8,27 September 2005,"I heard that this movie was set in a courtroom trial. And it is. The only time you see Emily is during flashbacks. A lot of people have complained that it there were only certain scary parts. But man, when those scary parts happen, do they ever scare the hell out of you! The scene in the barn was very well done; as was the first scene in Emily's dorm. The part where Jason wakes up and finds her on the floor twisted and staring at him scared the crap out of me. The movie is intelligently done in the fact that it shows you both sides of the story, how it could have been demonic possession or Epilepsy. Parts that were more uncomfortable than scary where the parts when she says ""I am Lucifer, the devil in the flesh"" and ""You think you can beat me, father? Try"" or something along those lines. The virgin Mary scene was nicely done, with the fog and such. Jennifer Carpenter was brilliant as Emily. Tom Wilkinson did nicely as Father Moore, and Laura Linney was great as Erin. This movie should and probably will go down as the scariest of 2005. There really is no competition.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
173,lumieretrain,The Exorcism of Emily Rose by Scott Derrickson,7,1 June 2019,"The stories about exorcism are one of the most popular subjects to be told, through books, movies, television series and comic books. Some of these stories can be based on shocking real events, which would make the audience reflect about the beliefs conflict of the main characters, as it is one of the most important elements of the stories. These stories move on until the soul of an innocent, would be taken by one or more demons, to turn the innocent into a ferocious monster to commit the horror. Initially the parents of the innocent do not understand what is happening, but they would try to be as helpful as possible. Until the parents are searching for help, to end the horror which is slowly increasing. Then an exorcist would try with all of his will, to save the soul of the innocent, but with an inevitable consequence. Some of these stories would end either, with the death of the exorcist or even with the innocent. The filmmaker Scott Derrickson decided to release a movie about an exorcism, based on a true story which would be told through flashbacks. To let the audience reflect about two different point of views of the story, by making it interesting and mysterious filled with suspenseful scenes. In 2005 came out The Exorcism of Emily Rose by Scott Derrickson, with Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson and Jennifer Carpenter. The movie's plot: The lawyer Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) would defend in the court, the priest Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson). As he has been accused of negligent homicide, while he performed an exorcism on the teenager Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). The movie uses the horror elements with gothic atmospheres through shadows, specific sounds and spooky images, to make the story scary by giving the audience tension in the most unexpected moments. But in the same way, the story can be also emotional, to see how the young girl get through the horror until her life would be taken with a dramatic consequence. The camera captures the most unexpected moments, to be unforgettable in every angle shots and as well as through the camera movements. The story gets interesting at the court scenes where would be seen two different point of views, the medical point of view and the religious point of view. To explore how the court would try to see, which one of the point of views is be believable and how the priest should be judged. Laura Linney did an excellent job as Erin Bruner, an agnostic lawyer who would do anything to defend Father Richard Moore. Even she has difficulties to be a believer, but she is strong enough to be not stopped by anything, neither if the court would get complicated. Tom Wilkinson did a well done performance as Father Richard Moore, a priest who in the course of the story explains how he tried in all the way to save Emily Rose. In the same way, he helps Erin Bruner to solve her doubts, as she would understand better about Father Richard Moore. Jennifer Carpenter was extraordinary as Emily Rose, an innocent who had so much will to build her future. Until Emily's path turns into a great horror which she cannot escape, even Father Richard Moore tried in all the way to save her. The score by Christopher Young was elaborated, to balance the story's atmosphere to be workable. Some tracks of the score get scary with great suspense in every notes of the rhythm, until other tracks get emotional to describe the inevitable faith of Emily Rose. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is one of the most intriguing and captivating movies of all time.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Sure it's not brilliant and it has a lot of problems, but it's not terrible neither. At the very least it's trying to do something a little different with a genre that's been done to death: how many demonic-possession horror movies do we have out there now? Exactly. And they're all just carbon-copies of each other. Everything's either a house is possessed or a family member is possessed etc. However with Emily Rose they put a refreshing spin on it by turning it into a court case and telling the story through eye-witness accounts etc. The priest in charge of the exorcism is prosecuted when the demon- possessed girl dies. And that's where my optimism ends, while I do commend the film for trying something different, everything else is bog- standard clichéd horror fare: the dark figure in the shadows, the sudden noises at specific times of the night, the possessed eating insects, hurting themselves, scratching the walls, etc, etc. Oh, and the screaming, how much screaming can there be in a movie?!

177,Junker-2,Insulting,2,1 April 2006,"Back in the bad old days, before the advent of modern medicine, people with conditions such as epilepsy were treated horribly. Not understanding what caused these conditions, such people were often thought to be possessed by demons. They were shunned, beaten and locked away in asylums or even prisons.Today we know better than to treat human beings in such a manner. Or do we?The problem with ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is that it asks us to take a large step backwards in our thinking. In the disguise of ""keeping an open mind"" it asks us to reconsider what modern science has taught. Hey, maybe those crazy acting people with this so-called epilepsy are really demonically possessed after all! The movie pretends not to take sides. It wants us to believe it is presenting the facts in a fair and balanced manner. But the film does take sides. It is very clear the message the makers of this film wanted to convey. Just watch the courtroom scenes.In presenting his case, the prosecution is clamped down on hard by the judge. He is not allowed to ask any questions with even a hint of speculation attached to them. Yet when the defense makes her case, suddenly the judge allows all sorts of wild speculation. ""Why do you think God allowed Emily to suffer so?"" Would any courtroom allow such a question? Only in a movie such as this.Oh, the acting in the movie is fine. The cinematography is good. In fact, there is plenty to admire about the way the film was made. But first you must get past a theme which is way past insulting. People with epilepsy and other such conditions have challenges enough in life without having to overcome people wondering if they might be possessed by the devil.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

There are some scary scenes but not that scary. But, one scene was particularly very creepy. The scene is that in the actress house at 3:00 the clock stops and she smells gas.

It is a court drama mixed with flashback horror  highly effective in every single scene, which Emily is in. Lurking and terrifying.As it is based on a true story, the film is much more unpleasant, disturbing and frightening than other horror movies released in many years.

I'll say it one more time. Very disturbing, very scary, very smart, very unforgettable. This film is awesome. One of the best I've ever seen, and I'm only 12 years old.

I really enjoyed the simple fact that someone was able to take a real-life story, (or a story with such ""possibilities""), and make it so utterly clear and horrifying. This is nothing like ""The Exorcist"". Not at all, in fact, this one is primarily flash-back, rather than on-site, which is what I prefer, personally.The first thing I look for in a horror film is how realistic the movie is, and, for the record, one that's based on true events USUALLY turns out good. The second is that it hasn't already been done before. However, this isn't entirely bad, if you take a look at the newer ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films.I'm sure that there will/could be better films out there, but I've seen a lot, and I give this one an excellent rating.

182,AppleBlossom,Thought provoking,8,25 July 2006,"Actually I only just watched ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" several weeks ago. The film is indeed a thought provoking piece of cinema and I'm always intrigued by events of the supernatural. It might not have been gory or horrific in the general sense, but it sure made my hair rise in a few scenes. The acting (to me) was impeccable, making it all the more convincing and coinciding the story with a courtroom drama was a nice touch. It definitely asks a lot of probabilities and we the viewer have the task to question our own acceptance of the plight of Emily Rose in the end. The film states it's based on true events and this to me; whenever a 'real' story comes about scares me more than all the gore and monster films put together. We have something new in the way of combining a courtroom drama with horror or is it the other way round? No bother though, those two elements in this film (I think) work quite well together leading the viewer through some suspenseful and eerie moments. The main actors, to whom I have very high regard for, sure showcase their individual performances and demonstrated their talents within this film. One unknown actor though I haven't had the pleasure of seeing before is the title character; Jennifer Carpenter. A relevant newcomer I see starting her career only back in 2003 with Ash Tuesday (2003). It'll be interesting to see what her next film project will be, and I do hope she makes the right choices.

To it's great credit, it manages - mostly - to show restraint and not overdo things, adding greatly to the terror and horror. It is visually and psychologically scary, precisely because it remains within the realms of plausible, and lets the viewer make their own mind up. The cinematography and score are a work of art. The characters are interesting and compelling, the acting spot on. The ideas behind the movie were clearly very well thought out, and the whole story hangs together and is well told - a rarity.

Whether you're an atheist or devoutly religious, whether you do or do not believe in the spiritual or the demonic doesn't matter. This movie is an examination of faith vs. facts, facts vs. possibilities, and whether any of us can make room for reasonable doubt about the good in people. Compelling and with solid acting from start to finish, with its share of unsettling moments. While I did hope for more scares, and while I did predict certain plot elements, it didn't take away from my experience of the movie.

But nowadays, those trailers show all the best stuff in the movies and leave nothing but the long boring scenes for the actual movie. The trailer for this movie was entertaining but contained all ""possesed"" scenes and left a long, tedious and boring trial that lasted 110 minutes. It was supposed to be a horror movie not a court room drama.Many people seem to like this film despite its obvious flaws and that is OK, but this movie is not scary by any means. The script was bland, the acting was bad. Carpenter was the only decent actress in this film and she did a good job. It's a shame that the movie went nowhere so she ended up being overshadowed by this awful film.The plot was terrible, I mean, why would you accuse a priest of medical negligence when there was a doctor present in the exorcism? That was just stupid. And the final ""veredict"" was like a kick on the throat. Many mainstream films feel the ""need"" to have happy endings, which I think is wrong but acceptable.

Laura Linney plays the same part she played in Primal Fear, only this time she's defending Tom Wilkinson (as the exorcist accused of the negligent murder of Emily) and is being haunted by either demons or her own imagination. There are some intense moments from Emily's last days that rule the movie, thanks largely to powerfully-lunged contortionist (and Louisville native!) Jennifer Carpenter as the title character. My favorite scene is the attempted exorcism that moves from the bedroom to the barn - exciting and just what the movie needed to be rescued from obvious liberties taken with the story, like Linney's haunting nights and the fate of a surprise witness to the exorcism.

I really really hate them. Unfortunately this movie has the most court room scenes then any other movie I have ever seen. It felt like People's Court plus Divorce Court with the exorcism playing in the background. Actually it is quite amazing. Is there any movie that contains more courtroom scenes? I challenge anyone to tell me of a movie that has more court room scenes. Any ways, I really hate courtroom scenes because the exaggerated emotional rhetoric This movie averaged an objection every two minutes. Come on! I watched trials. Real trials do not contain emotionally charged rhetoric and objections every two minutes. I actually got sick of seeing that judge's face. She said ""over-ruled"" and ""sustained"" along with every annoying two-minute objection.It is too bad about the court room annoyances. I almost liked the way the movie was heading. It was Religion vs. Science. This supposed exorcism of Emily Rose shows both sides of the argument. It debunks the superstitious modes of belief of possession. It supports the idea of Emily's problems as a result of an Epileptic-Psychotic problem and not a possession. It felt like Darwinism vs. Creationism in another form. I found it hard to be scared during this movie while there was reason to believe that a curable medical problem is the cause of Emily's problems. The movie was supposedly based on a true story, and it leaves it up to the viewer which side to believe. I personally would side with science and medicinal explanations for the problems Emily were experiencing. This movie was a fictitious account based on a true story. I think it would have been a better documentary then a fictitious recreation.According to the end credits, Emily's gravesite has become a shrine and pilgrimage for religious believers. It kind of reminds me of recent current pilgrimage sites. For example, recently there was a water stain under a bridge in Chicago. The water stain was shaped like the Virgin Mary. People flocked to that water stain. People needed vindication for their belief, and it was found in a water stain. I am sure people will find vindication watching this movie, but I actually felt the opposite. I felt it was a vindication that in a civilized society you will never find a true possession. Only in third world countries that lack medicine will there be possessions. Or in this case when medicine is refused based on belief will you have the same supposed possession, as was the case with Emily. She did not continue medical treatment, and her condition worsened.

We're told she died soon after an attempted exorcism by the Rose family's parish priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson). The state contends her death was directly caused by Moore's involvement, and presses charges in a controversial case that will, in essence, put the entire archdiocese on trial. Emily was epileptic and psychotic, alleges the prosecution, and died after following the priest's advice to discontinue medication. The defense counters that Moore's involvement was at the Rose family's request, that all involved believe Emily's torment to be spiritual, and aggravated by medication, and that Emily herself consented to the exorcism. Who is right? And more importantly, is being wrong a criminal offense? These are intriguing questions involving entirely differing worldviews, and the associated subjectivity of ""facts."" Yet ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" shies away from establishing ANYTHING as demonstrable true. Emily is either epileptic or she isn't, for example, and this is likely to be provable in court. Argument over the causes of a remedies for such is one thing, but it's hard to imagine such a fundamental point still in dispute at the end of a lengthy trial. It's also unclear what Father Moore's specific involvement was that may have caused Emily's death. We're told she died from various traumas, exacerbated by acute malnourishment. At least in the flashbacks of the exorcism we're shown, though, Moore rarely even physically touches the girl.But while ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" goes to sometimes too-great lengths to remain seemingly ambiguous, it also repeatedly suggests it has its mind made up; Emily was possessed by demons that ultimately killed her, and which may have their sights set on the subsequent trial. Defense lawyer Erin Brunner (Laura Linney) keeps waking up at 3AM  the demonic witching hour, according to Moore  and a key witness is incapacitated after apparently seeing some otherworldly omen. Like all courtroom dramas, the film ultimately comes down to a verdict and, like most, tries to have it both ways. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" seems to want to be an arty horror flick, but that would require it to take sides unabashedly. Doing so, or remaining truly undecided to leave the audience to its own conclusions, might have made it a more intriguing film.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

192,Dorjee_Wang,Not your typical horror,9,16 June 2015,"I remember watching this movie a few years ago and I got absolutely creeped out yet loved it back then (Hey! Don't blame me I was just a kid then).Recently I popped it in again and re-watched it. And I was really happy that my choice a few years ago wasn't bad (lol!). Because this movie is an absolute gem amongst horror.It steers clear from typical horror movie because it doesn't follow the usual ""build-up-halfway-throw-everything-after-half-time"" strategy. The movie is based around a true controversial story. It's unusually is a court drama-esque horror which accounts the case of manslaughter of the eponymous girl against a priest. Dealing with faith vs doubt, it highlights a lawyer's internal conflict on being doubtful yet defending a priest. The horror in this case is shown throughout the movie. It is overall very intelligently made.But the unusual setting or the plot isn't what makes this movie great. The strong performances by both leads (Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter) is what sets this cut above the usual horror movies out there. Linney does well here, her character's internal conflicts on what to believe, her agnostic approach to defending a priest are carried out great but Carpenter is the true hero of this movie. A naive girl being possessed by multiple demons, her demonic countenance, her bloody contortion, deserves an award based on how well they were done. Her performance will scare you out, so be warned.The performances, the screenplay, the directing, everything works on this movie's favour. While it could've done better with a shorter length, you won't regret using up your 120 minutes on this movie, because it's spectacular. 9/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
193,luke-346,"This is not your normal, standard, run-of-the-mill generic horror. It is better than that!",7,17 November 2006,"There aren't many moments in this film that will have you on the edge of your seat, as is there aren't many moments that will truly terrify you. What this film will do is open your eyes to the genre and the idea of demonic possession.I agree with some other comments in that this film will probably be missed by many of those that choose not to watch horror (or film snobs), however I would implore people to watch it if they fancy the idea of seeing an interesting court room drama with a horror twist.The film centres around Emily Rose whose character is loosely based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, a Catholic woman from Germany who died in 1976 after several unsuccessful attempts to cure her from an ""alleged"" state of demonic possession through psychotropic drugs. The film centres on the court room although it makes clever use of flashback sequences to depict the trauma that Emily Rose sustained during her time of the alleged possession.From an artistic point of view the film isn't as great; it lacks any real vision and horror that the title might suggest. Although the obvious influences are there (from Friedkin himself to modern Japanese horror) the films ultimate demise lies in it trying to balance religion with scientific debate yet never really managing to succeed, leaving it with quite an ambiguous feeling. What the film does manage to do is deliver the 'possibility' of a scientific explanation for all the ideals and theories that surround exorcism (as opposed to the religious beliefs) thus leaving us with many questions unanswered. As with many films that concern religion in today's society, I feel this is a shame.However, having said all of the above I still feel that this is a very interesting take on the genre and is something that should be watched  purely for (if nothing else) the debate that might ensue.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

195,jon2005,The Exorcism of Emily Rose,8,22 May 2006,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a unique film in that it is a mixture of two rather different genres. It has been advertised as a horror film, and to an extent it is, but its central theme is a courtroom drama. It may at times be an uneasy mix of genres, but it is a brave move to combine them, with mostly excellent results.Based on a true story, The Exorcism of Emily Rose centres around the trial of Father Moore (Wilkinson), who is arrested for negligent homicide after an exorcism of a teenage girl (Carpenter) goes wrong. Father Moore was convinced, as was Emily herself, that she had been possessed but the prosecution starts to give convincing evidence that Emily in fact suffered from a severe medical condition. Father Moore is defended by atheist lawyer Erin Bruner (Linney), who tries to defend the priest whilst fighting her own beliefs (or lack of them) which doubt whether Emily was actually possessed, and Father Moore's warnings that she could be a target for the demonic.Emily's story is told in flashbacks during the court case  a fairly standard exercise  but this is where the horror element of the film comes in; with a stunning performance from Jennifer Carpenter, we slowly see Emily falling deeper and deeper into her possession/illness. However, we spend surprisingly little time getting to know Emily herself, instead just focusing on her condition when it relates to the trial. There are some real shocks to be had here, a stand out point being Emily running through the rain while the faces of everyone she passes appears to start melting  it certainly is creepy, and this is where The Exorcism of Emily Rose stands out from, say, last year's Exorcism: The Beginning. It builds its atmosphere steadily but creatively, and whilst there are shock moments, it is genuinely more terrifying because of the mood it establishes, and it urges you to watch on regardless.The horror sections of the film, whilst good, are nothing that new  it's on the level of most good horror films, but on its own this is not enough. This is where the courtroom drama angle steps in. In this film, the audience is constantly wondering as to Emily's condition: was she really possessed or just ill? The reason the answer is so unclear is because of the brilliant way that the trial is presented. Every time something religious is presented, the prosecution (ably led by the religious but scientifically-minded Campbell Scott) is able to bring up a convincing scientific argument, then Bruner will bring up a convincing counter-argument. What makes the trial so good to watch is the fact that there are very few holes in the arguments  each are, from their own point of view, equally as valid as each other. It is an excellent example of the ever-ongoing religion vs. science debate, and is handled with clever writing and a deft directorial hand.The Exorcism of Emily Rose does take a while to get going, preferring a slow build up before the trial reaches its zenith. From the exorcism onwards though, the tension shoots up and stays up throughout. The exorcism itself is very gripping, terrifying and thrilling. From there the film is enthralling, and is supported superbly by the whole cast, especially Laura Linney who has to hold much of the film on her own. The sight of her in a supposed horror film immediately tells us that the film will be much more than it at first appears, and it does not disappoint. It has moments of unnecessary laying-on of the demonic side of the story, but mostly excels because it prefers not to take sides as to what truly happened to Emily Rose.After recent disappointments of horror films lately, The Exorcism of Emily Rose can sit on top of the pile with pride. It's well worth seeing for trying, and succeeding, in being different and much cleverer than your average dose of horror. Who'd have thought it: a thinking man's horror film?

197,conspracy-2,"""Based on a true story"" doesn't mean that what you see ever happened.",7,16 October 2006,"The real Emily Rose, a German girl named Annaliese Michel, had a story which on the surface is similar to the Emily Rose in the movie, but the details are pretty far off. Significantly, the court case ended very differently in real life than in the movie. The movie's depiction of the exorcism is full of mystical spiritual ghosty happenings which have no basis in fact. So, in other words, this is a pretty darn loose dramatization of the true story on which it is based.Having said that, it's not all bad. The film does, for the most part, go out of its way not to make it's mind up for the audience. A skeptical explanation is provided for every supernatural one, and the two viewpoints are given reasonably fair and balanced treatment. If you're convinced of either the saintliness or the psychosis of Emily, you're not going to be swayed. That's a good thing, but it seems to forget this idea for the exorcism scene, where no rational questions, explanations or debunkings are asked or given for the wild story told in court. That's a shame, because aside from this fault, it's actually a lot less sensationalistic than it could have been.In conclusion: meh. It's a movie.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

My travels in the developing world, even to this day, give me encounters with the demon-possess and people engaged in ""spiritual warfare.""

202,GrimmBrother,A thought provoking thriller filled with suspense,8,24 December 2006,"The Plot A young girl named Emily Rose dies under the care of her parish priest. While attending college, Emily believed she became possessed. After medical care ceases to work, she turned to her religion. In the care of her priest she dies and he goes on trial for her death. He is represented by a career-minded and driven lawyer who does not believe in God.Thus is the story of Emily Rose, told by those in the trial and the priest who watched her through her possession. Plenty people believe that Emily just had epilepsy but others believe she was possessed by the devil. But which one is it? The Pros Don't think that this is a trashy horror film because it really isn't. This film is so interesting and thought provoking. It makes you wonder about life beyond the real world, AKA, the spiritual world. It actually seems so true. After all, it is based on a true story. The acting is really good and the story is just so intriguing. It isn't exactly a horror though, although there are plenty of frightening scenes.The Cons The only thing that I would've liked to see is other real things that happened to the real Emily Rose (which isn't the real girl's name by the way). So many other strange things happened to her and it would've been great if we got to see them in this film.Worth Hiring/Buying? Yes, if you are a fan of or collect movies where people are possessed, ie, The Omen, The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, then this will be a great addition to your collection. Even if you don't like movies like that then you may still just enjoy this, after all, like I said it isn't exactly a horror. It is more like a mystery and a thriller.The Final Word This is a fantastic film filled with mystery, horror and suspense.

204,jeev7882,"Entertaining, but not insightful",6,18 September 2005,"Grade: C (6 stars) I have mixed feelings about this movie. One one hand, it's well acted, relatively well written and directed, and overall it's entertaining. On the other hand, I rolled my eyes about a dozen times because the movie failed to convince me that Emily Rose was anything but a psychotic schizophrenic country girl whose condition could only be interpreted as spiritual by the Roman Catholic Church.No offense to Catholicism in general (especially to my Catholic and Christian friends), but I often find that events involving God or the devil on Earth are never looked upon rationally by Catholic religious leaders. That being said, I found it strange that Father Moore was tried for negligent homicide and not Emily's parents. Father Moore's intentions seemed to be noble even if he was mistaken. Emily's parents were the ones who didn't just take her to the hospital to be cared for. They agreed to cease her being fed. They watched their daughter deteriorate in their own home and they did nothing about it except entrust her care to a priest whose only real solution was to attempt an exorcism which then failed.As you can tell, I had somewhat of a bias towards this subject going into the film. I'm not saying that I do not believe in demonic possession, but I think with our knowledge of psychological disorders these days it is very hard to justify such a claim. There are a million and one question marks surrounding the validity of a demonic possession claim such as Emily Rose's. Let's apply Ockham's Razor (in a nutshell: when faced with two equally valid alternatives, choose the simpler) to her situation as presented in the movie. The evil all powerful devil decided to possess a basically useless 19 year old country bumpkin, or she was schizophrenic? The Virgin Mary (don't even get me started on that one either) visited this girl and gave her a choice to go to heaven or stay on Earth so people would believe in the spiritual realm, or, again, poor Emily was hallucinating due to her deteriorating psychological condition? Movies like this usually have trouble balancing science and faith. Emily Rose is heavy on the relevant scientific testimony in the courtroom, but easy on the spiritual testimony. The movie clearly wants us to believe Emily's story, but all the spiritual elements are treated very lightly. Dr. Adani, a defense witness who was supposed to create a relevant link between the scientific and spiritual worlds, gives a ridiculous and over the top testimony that would have been appropriate for a stoner hippie in some low brow comedy.In the end, I did say that this movie is entertaining. It's a little long, and some of the scenes should have been cut shorter, but the flow and structure are tight. We always know where the movie is leading us. Emily Rose is predictable, but it knows where it wants to go, which, these days, is very refreshing. Laura Linney fills her shoes well as the confident attorney (though she seems to be the same person in every movie she is in) and Tom Wilkinson is the rock of the movie. It made more sense to me for Father Moore to be the main character because he had a stronger tie to Emily, and he had a more believable character arc as well.In the end, I'd say if you have to see it, at least wait for DVD. After all, an evening show movie ticket costs about $10 these days. Factor in the gas money and the quality of a movie (especially for a ""dinner and a movie"" date) is increasingly important.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
205,BrigitteD,"At last, an intelligent horror film.",6,21 September 2005,"After a series of unnecessary sequels and prequels to the classic 1973 film which started it all, ""The Exorcist"", ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" attempts to present itself as an original endeavor. It may be original in the fact that it's the first horror film to camouflage itself under a primary legal drama, but maybe not as much when you consider that it's based on a previously publicized real-life case involving a German girl in the 1970's.The film is first and foremost a courtroom procedure which relies more on factual dialog rather than physical occurrences. Of course, it is occasionally punctuated by the obligatory startling jolt, but here, it is used to accentuate certain details, and not merely as a reactionary prop.Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter), is a young girl who has been raised by a devout Catholic family. Not long after leaving her desolate farmhouse to attend a city college, she begins developing unnatural physical and psychological manifestations.The film presents Emily's story after her tragic death, via courtroom testimony and recalled flashbacks, during which a priest, Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson), is standing trial for negligent misconduct following a failed exorcism attempt which is believed to have caused Emily's unfortunate ending.Assigned to defend Father Moore is Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), a borderline alcoholic, who still feeling guilty over the outcome of a previous murder trial, agrees to take on the case in the hopes of ascending the ranks of her career. Despite her representation of a religious subject, Erin is an agnostic, but soon, she begins reevaluating her beliefs, after she seemingly becomes stalked by ominous presences and indications during the darkest hours of the early morning.Opposing her, is Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a man of Catholic faith, yet, one who finds the whole hocus-pocus nonsense of evil spirits a ridiculous concept. He attempts to prove that Emily was not suffering from a spiritual imbalance, but rather, from a more believable medical ailment. It seems Emily was a schizophrenic/epileptic patient, which would explain her contorted seizures and hallucinations.The film is somewhat of a mentally interactive one as it asks that the audience draw up its own conclusion of what it believes really contributed to Emily's condition.As for the possession sequences, they are presented in a more realistic fashion, remarkably more subdued than the ones delivered by Linda Blair, and without the use of vulgar expletives.While it won't have the ability to make viewers faint while watching it, it will instead leave them with a lot to ponder.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The trailers and commercial led me to believe that this would be a supernatural thriller, like the Exorcist or the Omen.****Spoilers in this review****However, this is all bunk. This was not a supernatural thriller at all. It was a courtroom drama, much like LA Law or The Practice or even Century City. The whole ""supernatural"" aspect was simply a plot point in a courtroom drama story. Even then, the ""supernatural"" aspect may not even be true, considering that the court case itself was debating whether or not the character Emily Rose, *actually* experienced a supernatural encounter or simply had medical issues. ALL of the ""creepy"" parts of the movies (and there were only a few) could have simply been coincidences because the movie did NOTHING to prove that they *actually* happened.Okay, so it's a courtroom drama movie. How was it? Meh. It was okay, I guess. I'm not one for watching dramas, however.

Turns out the family that lived in that house made up all the ghost stories to get attention and money from the movie rights. They confessed to it. Studios continued giving the public what they wanted with more sequels and remakes of this confessed lie, all for the sake of profit.This film is based on something that supposedly happened in Germany in the 1970's, and now it's a film put in theaters, charging $10 a person, where it takes place in America in present day, playing to a population of 300,000,000 people who 85% believe in God, and 75% are Christian. That's a lot of money to be made. Just ask Mel Gibson, and the creators of Narnia.The only message of this film is, skeptics are just crabby and not realistic, and anything that's weird or coincidental in life has a purpose, and anything new to science is spiritually related. Science and reason are the bad guys, while irrational hopes for the fantastic to be true are more than hopes. It's a feel-good movie for people who fear or dislike skepticism. There is an attempt to make it sound like a balanced ending when she talks about ""possibilities"", but that's inconsistent with the rest of the film which says ""demons are real, demons are real, demons are real!"". Most people would rather believe the film's message because most paying customers don't consider skepticism an option, but yet want to make sense of this ""spiritual world"", without even considering once that the REASON the spirit world doesn't make any sense because it doesn't exist in the first place, so a movie like this will get high marks, even if it were shot with a home camcorder, and acted with the local neighbors.I call a mistrial.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

This is typical Hollywood - if the original story isn't sexy enough then twist it around till it sounds good. I'm getting really sick of them doing this.The real story is based on a German woman called Anneliese Michel who died in 1976 after undergoing an exorcism. She, her priest and her parents all believed she was possessed by demons. It all happened not too far away from where I live here in Germany so her story is a very well known one here in this country and there was widespread German public interest in this movie when it came out. However, the movie bears very little relation to the real story.Why was it necessary to move the movie to the United States? Why does the story have to be set in the present instead of 1976? Plus the movie totally distorts what happened to the priest and the parents. In the movie, the priest gets convicted and then freed with a ""time served"" sentence and the parents seem to walk away scot-free. In real life, the priest AND the parents all got 6 months probation. In the film, the prosecution demanded up to 10 years prison. In real life, the prosecution was content for the priest to be fined and the parents to be convicted but not punished.So in other words, this movie has been hyped up for excitement value. I was half-expecting everyone in the courtroom to be suddenly possessed and talking Aramaic.A new movie about Michel is coming out this year called ""Requiem"". It's a German language film with English subtitles and it is apparently much more accurate than this film.The acting in this film was not bad but the filmmakers accuracy with their fact-checking leaves a lot to be desired.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

And they take advantage of ignorance and poverty, selling nothing but a stupid, medieval idea about the good and the bad. After that, let's go back to the film. Is really a pity to see a great cast wasted. In one point, one of the lawyers says ""¿What is this? ¿A bad Twilight Zone episode?"" Exactly! Even worst is the fact of two BIG mistakes about exorcisms in this movie: 1- Only the Vatican can approve the making of an exorcism, and only after a long study of the case. Here the priest just ask his superior, and starts the next day. No way. 2- Never, by any reason, can a person stays in the room during an exorcism like the boyfriend does here. Only the priest (one or two) and, if necessary, someone in the family. It's nothing but crap...religious crap.

""EMILY ROSE"" is indeed scary and smart. you could tell the director did some work on this one. the colors used in this film are so intense and beautiful. Like how they use purple and orange in the terror scenes. And red in some other scenes. the acting superb. laura linney is so convincing and believable. the girl who plays Emily is so talented both with her acting skills and with her body. The scenes were she speaks in other languages and jumps around the room are so creepy and fun to watch. I understand that the director wanted to be subtle by not showing too much, but a little more horror would have been appreciated. Oh well the horror that is present is pretty satisfying. And what aids the horror other than color is music. The scores for court room and investigation scenes are just as perfect as the scores for the terror scenes.

219,Brent_P,Quality film that may lose interest to some audiences based on its poor marketing.,6,17 September 2005,"Like just about everyone else on this site, I went to this film with my hardcore cheezy horror flick buddy expecting another Japanese remake or another teen-scream job filled with cheap scare tactics and bad CGI featuring the usual creepy kid. Well, I got neither. Instead, the ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is more of a courtroom base drama, which tactically uses every single scary shot that are in the film in the trailers with the attempt to bring in a target audience, which may have disappointed some viewers.As mentioned before ""Rose"", is really a courtroom drama that centers around the trial of Father Moore (Wilkinson) who is on trial for his role in the death of Emily Rose (Carpenter) defended by an agnostic lawyer, Erin Bruner, played pleasantly by Laura Linney. The death of Emily Rose is in question: was she possessed or was she suffering from severe psychosis and epilepsy? After all medical tactics and tests had been exhausted and unresolved, Father Moore is brought in to cure her of her possession which unfortunately takes a wrong turn. It's during this trial where you see both sides of the court as Emily's recollections are revisited and where the creepiness comes in.Truthfully, I really wasn't disappointed with the fact that film was marketed incorrectly as I'm not really a big fan of horror flicks. I'm more annoyed with the fact that film, which was supposed to be based on a true story, was nothing close to what the actual story. The real case was set in Germany, involved 2 priests both which were on trial along with parents. Also, according to various information, the conference of German bishops agreed that she was NOT possessed. Quite an important piece of information since the film leaves it up the viewer to decides whether or not she was really possessed.Not only I was not scared, since they wasted all the creepy parts in the trailers, I was completely bored. The movie starts in the courtroom and ends in the courtroom and its filled with every courtroom cliché known to man. Rude and abrasive prosecutor? Check. Charismatic and underdog defense lawyer? Check. Surprise evidence? Check. Key witness dying or disappearing? Check. Surprise verdict? Check. After awhile I though this movie was based on another John Grisham novel.The acting was pretty good and dialog and the storyline is enough to keep you interested. The film also does a good job at reliving the events leading up to her death, shows both theories on what happened to her both with convincing tales. This is what really builds the film and holds it together. And, regardless of the tons of clichés, the film is still somewhat original with the rest of crap that's in the theater. Overall this is quality film that may lose some audiences due to the fact it isn't directed by Wes Craven and the acting is quite good. But, in the end I'd suggest Googling ""Emily Rose"" instead of watching the movie if you really want facts concerning her exorcism.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

A creepy score, some disturbing imagery, and plenty of moments that startle, but not quite scare you are what made Amity spooky, yet in a fun way, a quick adrenaline rush. 'Emily Rose' relies on practically the same method, however; a different level of fear is taunted. 'Amity', also based on true events, still never left you with doubts that what you saw was just a Hollywood scary movie, 'Emily' delves a little deeper and perhaps far too close to our reality by provoking a more conscious awareness to our individual faith, if you believe in God and his ability to directly take care of us, then you have to believe that evil is just as prevalent and is exactly what God protects us from. If the writers, both story and screenplay, stay as true to the actual events as possible and you have faith, I dare you to ponder the possibilities and what if you saw it with your own eyes.Jennifer Carpenter pulled off demonic possession so convincingly that I had to remind myself, ""she's just an actress."", but then again, I don't really see that one everyday!

Yes, I have a scary movie blanket(SMB), one that is big enough to cover me while I'm completely stretched out and I am able to pull up over my head. This one had me pulling it up just under my eyes several times. The whole plot is great, basically a young woman that is overtaken by a demon, and the way this is portrayed is wonderfully scary. The bedsheets being pulled away from her while she is in bed made me clutch my SMB tighter! ;) The way this girls face contorted when she would scream, was that her real face or did they enhance it? I'm not asking in a 'smart' way, I am truly serious. It was very convincing. The scariest part of the movie, for me, and even my husband found it a bit heavy, was when she started seeing things; ie the storm cloud that looked like the devil or , what has to be the freakiest thing I believe I have ever seen in my life was when everybody she saw made a face with black stuff coming out of the eyes and mouth and made that horrendous noise! The scene that really sticks in my head is when she is in class and she sees this shadow or whatever pass the window and it freaks her out, she looks over and this guy is looking at her all weird because she is shaking and shrieking, and then she looks back over to the window and then looks back at the guy and his eyes are oozing that black stuff and is making that noise. That was the freakiest thing ever because it was totally unexpected! And everyone she sees, even people in cars, on the sidewalk or in church looks the same way. FREAKY!!! I must say that was brilliant, and I was thinking this would be sheer pure hell if this was to happen to anyone. I mean, could you imagine?

I wouldn't even call this a horror movie though there are some really scary parts. I really think this is more realistic than The Exorcist.

I know a lot of people won't be able to see it for what it is because of the supernatural/horror elements (which are usually a turn-off for film snobs), but the movie is just extremely well-made.Consider the fact that Linney's character's true conflict is not winning the trial, but a satisfyingly complex internal struggle which I will not name so as not to spoil the movie. Or the plethora of food for thought that the movie offers, regarding existentialist issues of perception vs. objective truth, and social issues of liability and responsibility.Some very interesting scenes that find ways to express things in subtle and creative ways without spelling them out. And an incredible and ballsy performance by Jennifer Carpenter, which takes Linda Blair's possession to a whole new level. Also, notice how a key dramatic monologue is presented, contrary to what we might expect, with no sentimental music in the background. The cinematography is also great. I was reminded of Dario Argento's vivid colors in Suspiria on more than one occasion.Although it's not the focus of the film, the movie also offers a few very cool scare moments, and seeing Emily possessed is terrifying.This is my favorite ""underdog"" movie of the year so far.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

228,rocky_lifter69,How Hollywood Does Exorcisms,5,20 April 2009,"I was never overly interested in this movie as I knew it would never live up to the terror in The Exorcist. When I was finally dragged to see this movie, I found it to be an entirely different monster. And not in a good way.The movie itself plays out as more of a courtroom drama with a case rooted in horror film elements. It centers more on the trial of the priest that attempted to exorcise Ms. Rose and his defense lawyer. Apparently because the priest (Tom Wilkinson) was unable to help Emily and she ended up dying from her ""symptoms"", they are trying to hold the priest responsible. We get a bunch of flashbacks that show Emily go from nice, wholesome farm girl to demonically possessed and the attempts made to get the demons out.I can't say a whole lot good about this movie. It is terribly boring and has more than a few horror film clichés. The only praise I can give is to Tom Wilkinson, whose a fantastic actor even when given such poor material and to Jennifer Carpenter, who does some downright scary things in this movie. The part when she's on the floor in her dorm room all twisted and contorted? That was done with no visual effects. She did it herself. And the barn exorcism where she howls and shrieks in inhuman ways? Yep, her again. She even got so into character that she forgot the scene was done and attacked Wilkinson.

It also showcases the legal drama that unfolds as a lawyer (Laura Linney) defends a priest (Tom Wilkinson)accused of causing the death of a young woman by way of an exorcism ""gone bad"".The premise is good, and being based on a true story, I rented the film thinking it was going to be a sort of ""Inherit The Wind"" sort of thing.What I got was a surprisingly disturbing thriller that went beyond the courtroom to that possibility of demonic forces. The main part of the story was very engaging, yet there are questions that abound.For example, why didn't the writers and director flesh out the character of Emily Rose more? Why were we not exposed to more evil manifestations in the heroine before her death? Did the other family members witness ANY sort of strange occurrences going on? (That is, apart from the live hornet's nest shown at the film's beginning on a winter's day) Why didn't the prosecution pursue the psychotic break theory more vigorously? The film did have moments of sheer suspense and graphic acting out of demon possession WITHOUT the gore, feces, vomit, etc. popular in other movies of this type. The heroine, played by Jennifer Carpenter, made my spine tingle during her moments of anguish- her contortions were so realistic. The voice overdubbing during the possessions was chilling, although a bit too loud in my opinion.Both Wilkenson and Linney gave sturdy performances.

Then the trailer came and I started to see the potential. Now I have seen the movie, and I have to say that I'm impressed with the whole production. I see it as The Exorcist meets A few good men. Tom Wilkinson is excellent as the Man of the cloth accused of negligence during the exorcisim. Its clear to see that Tom has come along way since his role in The full monty, and with this character and his portrayal of the Dr in Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind, Tom is reaping the more meatier roles of his stripper friends. All though not a full blown horror film, the scary parts are shown in flashbacks, this is quite spooky. I'd go as far as to say that Emily Rose when possessed freaks me out more than young Blair, especially when contracting in weird positions on the floor. The movie moves along at a reasonable pace and is easily understandable. I can't help but think though that if this movie came out, say, thirty years earlier, it would have gone down as an absolute classic horror, but i believe it will be, i'm sorry to say, just a movie of the week.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

""Excorcism"" ends by lapsing into a failed finale so adolescent, it appears to have been a rejected script from Lifetime television.How did a film begin so well and fall so fast? My wife's theory is that perhaps the original ending planned for this film was ditched for testing poorly with audiences. Perhaps. But I think the pre-occupation with The Excorcist may be closer to the heart of the problem.

233,sammy105,Solidly made and focusing more on facts than on generic scare tactics,10,28 December 2005,"My initial outlook on watching the movie was that it would scare the hell out of me. That it did, and I suppose watching possession movies alone in a dark basement may not be the smartest thing, hehe. Strangely, I can mostly take it. Anyway, the basics of it were that the acting was accurate, the horror was believable and breath-taking, and the directing was skillful enough to put us in the right mood. What I found ironic was that the girl they'd put in the main role didn't seem like the right type at first. When I first saw her in her room telling her mother she was accepted to college, I was taken back by her innocence and humanity, no doubt. I didn't have second thoughts on her ability to portray the role correctly, but my thoughts were on her personal effects from this role. In the special features, the interviews with Jennifer carpenter were almost sad, I thought. The girl's voice trembled; she looked pale. Even though that's not necessarily a bad thing that the actress herself seemed freaked out of the project, it made me look at the movie more sympathetically than I expected to. I started wandering if the girl was that thin before the filming, or if she had to starve for the role. My conclusion is that compared to Linda Blair, Jennifer Carpenter did not have the natural evil in her to come out; the sufferings looked real as they could get. I wasn't upset about the lack of demonic faces throughout the film; watching an innocent girl tortured was bad enough. And sadly, the film wasn't only about the portrayal of suffering: Jennifer seemed overtaken by the role and maybe even shaken up by it, which added to the effect of the film from her own fears. But that was just sad. I would recommend this film to others, though not to be watched alone; the only thing I'll add is that the filmmakers kept stating in the after features that the movie was closely based on the real story. But why was the name changed as well as the location? The story is really based on Anneliese... something, a German college student. I guess I'll now be waiting for a movie even more closely based on the truth, using the real name and everything.

Fortunately, I was disappointed. The actual production itself is done very professionally, and the characters/actors do their jobs well. We are less concerned with the actors than the people they are portraying, and that is a very good thing.The movie is extremely believable, and hopefully will cause some people to realize that Satan is indeed alive and well--and would love to possess more of us.At the very least, it should help non-believers consider the possibility that there just might be a spiritual realm out there, complete with God and Satan, demons and angels.Because of Emily Rose and her story, perhaps some people definitely will pause and wonder, and get their spiritual lives in order.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
235,carnivalofsouls,A horror film about lawyers - not as scary as it sounds...,6,6 May 2007,"Let's face it, is there a worse horror sub-genre than the ""exorcism"" film? With the exception of the film that spawned it, 'The Exorcist', and maybe 'Ganja and Hess' and Blatty's underrated 'Exorcist III', these films have primarily been derivative trash along the lines of 'Beyond the Door'. Now then, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' provides us with an even less appealing sub-genre - the ""courtroom horror film"". Its title even clues you in that it is essentially 'The Exorcist' (young girl possessed by demon) meets 'Audrey Rose' (which has the lugubrious honor, in its final third, of being the first courtroom horror film). Nevertheless it is better than it should be, thanks to the casting of Laura Linney (wearing lots of make-up), Campbell Scott and Tom Wilkinson. Yet despite an eerie opening, it never really becomes its own film, too hung up on presenting a two-sided argument than creating atmosphere or chills, while the possession and exorcism scenes unfortunately recall Friedkin's classic, but without that film's technical brilliance. Perhaps an ambiguous character study, along the lines of Tourneur's 'Cat People', of Emily Rose descending into psychosis/possession would have been better advised than focusing on the aftermath of her death.

I think some people are turned off by the movie because they go in expecting ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", thankfully Derickson does a much better job of depicting true to life events better than those two. The movie very clearly states it is a courtroom horror/thriller film. And it delivers.The actors all do a top notch job, Linney especially depicts a typical agnostic very well and I think Derrickson is very fair to both sides of the spiritual debate. He intentionally leaves the question up for the viewer to really decide, as it should be, but I think the ultimate fate of the priest in courtroom...*SPOILER*** That being that he is found guilty and yet set free reflects wonderfully on the idea of God's grace given to mankind. We are all found ""guilty"" and yet pardoned.********* Some of the events depicted are reminiscent of films like the Omen and Amityville Horror, but, to be fair they added to the entertainment value without taking away too much from the realism and real questions the film brings up for each of us to consider.Hollywood very seldomly depicts Christianity in a good light or makes real statement about spirituality, This is one of the good ones.

There are some very good scenes that show the torment she goes through and may scare you a bit.Some scenes of the movie are beautifully shot, for example the end scene with the fog.I think all the main cast played their roles very well but Tom Wilkinson stood out for me, the man is a very good actor.So while I don't consider this film to be an all time great, it still makes very good viewing and is definitely worth watching.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Comparisons with ""The Exorcist"" will inevitably be made but this is a far more thought provoking film than the 1970s classic. For those wanting to see a gore fest, there are some ugly moments. But if you prefer a good story and real acting, then this film will not disappoint. Exactly the right balance between shocks and plot is struck and there are some genuinely scary moments also. Add to this, a legal battle and the politics of a big law firm, and you have a movie which attempts to keep all the balls in the air. It is the horror plot and the plight of Emily Rose which engages the audience most though. Her story is told in a series of flashbacks that are never disjointed or abstract. Indeed, it is the realism of her tragic story that is the most frightening thing in the film. It may even make you curious to read up on the true case the film is based upon. Solid and unpretentious performances from Tom Wilkinson as the priest and Laura Linney as his lawyer enhance the realism of the plot and steer it well clear of spoof horror. My only criticism would be that promising sub-plots end up going nowhere. Don't let this put you off though. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is that most rare of things.

I've noticed a lot with these PG-13 movies that the director tries to get a cheap scare out of the viewer by making something popup. I know that that's the normal with horror movies, but with a PG-13 rating it is so hard to accomplish this since there can't be a lot of gore.However, the movie itself should not be viewed as a horror movie. We get an interesting plot that includes the actually exorcisms rather just a movie with only exorcism like I suspected. This really helped boost the movie from what was bad to decent. On top of this, the acting was magnificent. Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) was by far the best played character. Campbell Scott did an excellent job as the prosecutor. He played the part as if he was the antagonist, and to some extent he was. The rest was the cast also did a wonderful job playing their respective parts. This helped boost the movie from decent to good.Overall, it was a good film. Don't expect to see original horrifying scenes. Every horror scene in this film has been done before.

241,EvilBaldDude,What I call a real horror film,8,26 December 2005,"There are two types of horror films.One is the type where they try to dazzle you with cheap computer generated effects, disturbing images, lots of gore, and other clichés.The other is the type where they just have a scary story, well told in a scary way.The Exorcism Of Emily Rose fits neatly into that second category.Jennifer Carpenter (such an attractive little biddy!) is excellent at contorting her face and body in a disturbing manner, to make you feel she really is being possessed. Little if any special effects are used, just good acting and a bit of makeup.On the minus side, I felt the script itself wasn't all that crash hot. The film meanders at points. But I still think it stands out, as an example of the fact that special effects and gore are no substitute for good storytelling and acting.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
242,nolanm_182,Better than I thought it would be,8,16 February 2006,"When I saw the trailer for this film, I figured it was going to be some sort of rip-off of the original Exorcist. Surprisingly, the movie was very good. Die-hard horror fans will probably be disappointed by this film because it is not just about a girl being possessed, its also a courtroom drama involving the priest (Tom Wilkinson) who is on trial for the death of Emily Rose, who died in the exorcism. Laura Linney gives a good performance as Wilkinson's lawyer. The movie does a good job balancing the scares and courtroom scenes equally. Some parts of this film did creep me out because they are so well done. Director Scott Derickson does a good job on the this film when you think it would be just a remake or a rip-off. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a good film for the fall and you should definitely look into it.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

244,mmjnr10,The Best Horror movie since The Exorcist ..Hands Down!!,9,1 July 2011,I honestly believe this movie is so under rated and for a huge fan of powerful horror movies I rate this one up there among the very best of all times. The storyline is terrifying especially for those with religious backgrounds; this one seriously touches your spine!! The movie is well written and acted mainstream type movie that I am sure for those serious followers of horror movies would have a feast watching and getting terrified by its incidents which start In the lead actress student dorm with one of the most terrifying possession scenes in cinematic history in my humble opinion and goes through several stages till it reach a climax with the exorcist trying to cast away the evil spirit to discover that there are multiple spirits to cast which proved too strong for him cope with.All in all this movie is a must watch especially for those fans of exorcism and demonic possession and in that category I honestly believe it's the best movie of its genre since The Exorcist with only one other movie that arguably can be better and that is The Rite by Sir Anthony Hopkins,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
245,girlingreen,"Not just another ""Possesion"" movie",8,3 December 2005,"This is exactly the sort of movie that receives the tag-line ""controversy"" before its initial release. Given the spate of possession movies since the infamous ""Exorcist"" movie in the 1970's, I wondered why people would be interested in another Demonic Possession movie in 2005. The reason became apparent when the story unfolded. I sat among a multicultured audience that evening, watching the harrowing spectacle of Emily Rose's plight during her period of possession. Whether or not we believed she was truly possessed or suffered a mental illness is unclear, but our hearts went out to Emily Rose regardless. Her suffering was poignantly touching and excited pity rather than revulsion during her manic demonic bouts.Kudos goes to the cast who brought the story to life. The controlled performances of EmilyRose,Fr. Moore and Erin Bruhrer were impressive to say the least. In fact this movie felt more like a t.v drama or a documentary without expensive S/Fx to hinder the story's flow. During the scene when Fr. Moore read out Emily's letter, there was utter silence in the theatric. This really impressed me, as the audience was a mixed religious group of Arab nationals, Hindus and miscellaneous others. I could almost read their uppermost thoughts. Was Emily Rose really sane when she accepted her fate in the field? Why did God allow all this to happen to her? I don't think we left the cinema theatre with the answers to these questions. But we did leave in thoughtful silence and reflection.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It is based on a true story, and they have done a good job here at presenting both sides of what may have happened, leaving you to decide for yourself which version you believe.

248,kyleroberts,Prepare yourself to start believing,8,6 December 2005,"I am quite fond of Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson, therefore I chose to go see this psychological thriller, although I am no longer a fan of this genre (after 'Saw'). I was not disappointed. I had a feeling that it was more like a documentary rather than a fiction film. I had had the chance to witness a real exorcism procedure and had a very different perspective on the whole film. I like the fact that it presented the story both from the science/medicine viewpoint and the religious one. If you have doubts, or if you wanna check out what kind of forces are around us, you should definitely try it out.

249,pattay72,Wait For the DVD,4,18 September 2005,"Shame on people who gave this movie good reviews. I went to see it based on your comments. ""Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."" This movie could have been so much better if the director had not included so many meandering courtroom scenes that served no purpose to explain or add to the plot. There were of course, too many clichéd visual tricks which got old fast, and after the obligatory, but generally good, horror shots ran their course, the audience became bored and fidgety. And why the judge's character got so much scene time is beyond me.A basic flaw was that the many subplots were too shallow and vague (what's with Linney's boss being so threatening?) that left us expecting more. The priest was certainly a pivotal character, and yet he was mostly presented as a sweaty, nervous stutterer, acting more like a guilty child molester than a man of the cloth firm in his beliefs. Too bad the aspect of Shoreh Agdashloo's appearance was left so unsatisfying as well. The entire premise of her character as the expert on possession could have explained a lot about Linney's legal approach, and to be sure, if the director had used her more as an expert witness, the audience would have also been more on the priest's side, feeling more satisfied in Emily's demonic possession versus the epilepsy theory. It was such a major scene, such a major turn of events in the film to hear Agdashloo's testimony, and yet nothing really came of it. But then, everything in this movie left you waiting for more. Also, as someone already mentioned, the car accident was the most asinine ever.There were just too many duplicated scenes in the courtroom and the lawyer waking up every night at the same time or looking glumly into her martini (we got it, we don't need to see it a hundred times). The movie basically just dragged you into a stupor. The priest kept saying, ""I want to tell Emily's story"", but the irony is that the movie, nor the priest, never really did.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
250,darkcybergeek,What happened to Emily?,8,17 September 2005,"I was really surprised with this movie, in many ways. I went in expecting notting really, and got out frightened. I really couldn't sleep! The movie is very slow and as most of of you know most of the scenes take place at the court. And although i found this to be original in a horror movie, because of this i found the movie to be at times dull and uninteresting. But i forgive this due to something i will explain soon.Now what i liked about the flick is we'll the acting, especially Jennifer Carpenter and Laura Linney. They we're just amazing. Very believable. The rest of the cast was good, but just this too stood up! Then there we're the exorcism scenes, and they we'e just scary. I haven't been scared by a movie this year, but this one? Yeah it was scary. The atmosphere it created was one more thing and there was one scene in particular that i thought to be the most intriguing visually. (*Spoilers*)It involves Emily walking outside her house and there's a lot of fog.(*End of spoilers*) I just love it, it's so intense.What i did not like was the use of CGI, at times it took me out of the film. I hate CGI in serious horror movies! They take the seriousness out. And then there was that ending...I really think it was very unreal, i would have ended it with a more depressing end. For a movie i really had no hopes i thought it was smart, scary, and at times very intense. I suggest you to see it if you love movies as much as i do.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

252,titanrd1,Pretty Good,8,10 September 2005,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" By: Ryan DePesa""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" has a somewhat misleading title. ""The Trial of Fr. Moore"" would be much more suitable. While it is not quite what it is made out to be in the trailers that we've all seen running for months it remains a fascinating film all the same. It's been a trend recently to promote horror flicks as ""based on a true story"" (""The Amityville Horror"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" etc). It is refreshing to finally see a horror film built on a foundation of reality that follows through.The film begins as Fr. Moore, exorcist to Ms. Rose, is charged with reckless endangerment leading to the death of, you guessed it, Emily Rose. Fr. Moore's defense attorney is Erin C. Bruner, who will be made partner if the trial goes her way. In an effort to clinch the promotion, she bargains with Moore. In return for allowing him to testify (which the archdiocese is sorely against) and ""tell Emily's story"" he will allow her to do ANYTHING else it takes to win the case. It is through this story, told in short spurts by several different characters, that we see Emily's possession and exorcism.Our first glimpse of Emily is that of a teen girl thrilled over receiving a college scholarship. Next thing you know, she's out of the little farm house and in a dorm. You know nothing good can happen in a horror movie when there's a close up of a clock at a particular time. In this case, it's 3:00am which we are informed is the ""witching hour"" for demons to attack (it is the opposite of the time that is believed to be Christ's time of death). Emily is awoken from a deep sleep by the smell of something burning. She goes out into the corridor to investigate and finds nothing but an eerie swinging door. She returns to her bed, a bit spooked, and is almost immediately pinned by an indiscernible presence which seemingly enters her body through her mouth. From this point on, she begins to suffer hallucinations, seizures, malnutrition, and as the evil spirit consumes her further: speaking in tongues, and stigmata.As Emily's story of possession gradually builds, the trial keeps us optimistic as to the cause of Emily's behavior. The prosecutor, Ethan Thomas, has an explanation for everything. He believes that the hallucinations and seizures are a caused by ""psychotic epilepsy,"" The speaking in tongues - a foreign language class, and the stigmata - self inflicted. Ultimately, it is up to us to decide whether she was possessed or suffering from an illness. One could find notable reasons to support each possibility. I'm still unsure which I believe.If you're looking for a movie to scare you this is probably not it. There's about two moments that may shock you but no shots that are truly scary. I'm not complaining though, for the whole film retains an eerie atmosphere while never loosing it's plausibility. The acting is superb, there's no weak link in the chain. It's interesting to watch a federal court deal with a matter of faith and even more so to watch a self proclaimed ""woman of doubt"" (Erin) become a believer. In one of the most profound pieces of dialogue in the film, Erin describes how she came upon a locket, lying in the street, with her initials engraved upon it. She was taken aback by the idea that out of all the people who could have found it, she did. And for once in her life, she felt like anything she did wrong in the past was forgotten and she felt like she was on ""the right path.""""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a thought invoking film with a real story and heart - 3 ½ stars.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
253,henben,Will give you nightmares,7,13 December 2005,"After seeing this movie you'll be very afraid of being woken at 3 am. And if you do wake up at 3 am...well, let's just leave it at that for now. I had never heard of Jennifer Carpenter before this movie. Now I think I'll be hearing a whole lot more about her, and seeing more of her as well. And well deserved it is - her portrayal of Emily is superbly scary and harrowing while at once you feel the terror in her mind at not being able to fight her inner demons. To be fair, all the actors are excellent. Linney's agnostic/mystic who tries to understand this strange thing called faith. Wilkinsons quiet, softspoken, priest and Scott's man of faith appalled by what has taken place. The movie elegantly shows the same stories from different points of view and quietly balances between faith and science. However, as I had expected, everything sort of leans over on the faith-side towards the end. It would have been nice if that had been left entirely up to the viewer. There are some genuinely scary moments in this film and you get a good look at what has driven Emily into madness/taken possession of her body. The climactic exorcism is of course the scariest part, the best thing is that they don't overdo it. Everything falls within what could take place if she was, or wasn't, possessed. A final word of advice - don't watch this right before going to bed.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
254,InfiniteInertia,Clever film that avoids cliché's and heavy handed religious overtones,7,21 March 2006,"I watched this film last night with a friend who also appreciates ""Exorcist"" style films and horror movies; neither one of us had heard of the film previously.I was pleasantly surprised by the way it avoids all the usual religious and moralistic pitfalls; telling people what they should believe in and chastising anyone who doesn't pray regularly...Instead the agnostic defence lawyer played by Laura Linney, is gradually exposed to reasonable doubt herself: over the guilt of her client and his whole system of belief and right/wrong ; good versus evil. It is a clever story of how even selfish and self motivated people still do the right thing where innocence has been made to suffer and/or die, going as far as to portray death to those who try to take the stand and testify against the devil (that poor Psychiatrist)! After seeing all this coincidental evidence over the course of the trial, leading toward the only possible explanation that there are supernatural forces waging war on earth with the lives of all us minions held in the balance, she cannot help but pursue an honourable course of action.Another underrated and excellent performance by Laura Linney (gorgeous to boot); demonstrating good acting and a believable character change arc resulting in a quietly spoken modern suspense film, that probably dips down under your radar.Having neither the violence or gratuitous gore of many horror/suspense films; it is one that most of the family can enjoy, and Christians etc will especially enjoy the moral drama aspect of the fathers' plight.Rent this film & you wont be disappointed.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Yes, there are moments that are telegraphed a mile away (the one and only professional witness that can back up the priest's claims meets an expected end before being able to testify), but still, the movie is more a lesson in faith than it is another story about the devil and the Catholic Church doing battle.It is nice to have expectations of a movie going in and then it turn out to be something totally different.

The acting really made this film work. The limited use of special effects was welcome after so many crappy movies with slashers and computer-generated monsters. Campbell Scott played a crucial role as the straight-laced religious man who prosecutes the priest. Every time the story gets carried away with the supernatural, he provides the rational explanations and the right touch of skepticism. The fact that Laura Linney's character is not religious and doubtful to the end also makes her fear more affecting. The actress who plays Emily Rose is incredible. Her physical performance makes the exorcism scenes work. Great piece of work.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
258,ventery,A Tragic Story of Demonic Possession,8,23 April 2019,"As I read through various other user reviews, I noticed two distinct ""flaws"" that the viewers were commenting on and that is the religious undertone of the film and the apparent exploitation of the tragic death of a young girl. While I sympathise with many viewers and agree that the death of Anneliese Michel was very tragic, I think it's important to remember that this is a film created to entertain viewers and that's exactly what it did.The apparent exploitative aspects of the film was not clear to me because there were many differences in the film that did not correlate with the true story it is based on. Whether we like to admit it or not, there are many of us who question the existence of both good and evil, and what ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" did, was it awakened our instinctive human nature: our insatiable curiosity about the morbid and dark aspects of life.As such, I will be giving my own interpretation of the film based on my experience while watching it. After all, that is why we review films, is it not? To relay our experience to help others decide whether to watch the film or not.I'm going to start by giving a short summary of the plot. The film centers around the trial of Father Moore who stands accused of homicidal negligence when he performed an exorcism on Emily Rose. Throughout the film, there is a time jump between the past and present as defence lawyer, Erin Bruner tries to discover what happened.The atmosphere of the film was very ominous and added great zest to its horror factor. The tone was set beautifully with very little lighting in most scenes and eery camera movements throughout. Of course the CGI effects were also executed well or perhaps all due credit should go to the make-up artists who did an amazing job on Emily's transformation from a ""normal"" girl to that of an ill-looking possessed soul.As for the acting talent, I have to compliment the casting director's choice of actors and actresses. Jennifer Carpenter was outstanding in her role as Emily Rose and somehow managed to make both ""possession"" and ""psychotic epilepsy"" believable. Another stand out performance was that of Tom Wilkinson who played Father Moore. Wilkinson's performance was very believable and I felt myself sympathise greatly with Father Moore, even so far as believing that his faith was sincere. And of course, no one commanded my attention quite like Laura Linney did. She played agnostic lawyer Erin Bruner and had me glued to the screen from start to finish - her performance was both sincere and riveting.Furthermore, the underlying themes in the film is what made it so creepy. Not only does the film touch on the biggest of all taboos; demonic possession but it also touches on the most basic of all human qualities: our tendency to try to rationalise everything and it's this aspect of our human nature that was so beautifully portrayed by the members of the courtroom, from judge to members of the jury. Another noteworthy theme was that of religious faith which weighed whether exorcisms are in fact real or whether they are nothing more than psychological manipulation aimed at making the possessed soul believe they are possessed.Whether you believe in a higher power or not, there is no denying that ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" awakened your imagination and left you questioning your own ideas about faith and demonic possession. That is what I took away from the film and that is why I think it deserves an astounding 8 out of 10 stars.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

There was nothing about this story that drew me into it. The pacing, the characters, the alleged disturbances all were too simple and drab to make me even care about this Emily Rose. There wasn't much for me to conclude that his chick was actually possessed and in fact, I believe she was just a very ill person.There wasn't one creepy scene that you hadn't already witnessed in previews and they gave up her fate at the beginning, so you already know what'd going to become of her right off.Total waste of a rental.

But it is something totally different. It's MUCH better than that.It IS VERY creepy, but it isn't a horror film. It's a fascinating psychological study combined with a tense and moving courtroom drama.And if that fact keeps you from seeing this film, then it's YOUR loss. But I really enjoyed it.The stupid TV commercials for the ""Unrated"" version are misleading because they try to set this up as a gory, supernatural movie. They even have a quick clip where Emily Rose has glowing eyes -- but that isn't even in the film!! In fact, there are very few special makeup effects or CGI -- which is good. Cheesy effects like that would have taken away from the real story.The scenes of Emily's possession are both frightening and heart wrenching, but it's all because of the incredible Jennifer Carpenter who plays Emily. Her intense acting and her amazing ability to contort her face into masks of sheer pain and terror make you feel like she is actually being tormented by demons -- or she is merely suffering from a psychological breakdown. That's just it, you NEVER know which.BTW, the ""Unrated"" versions is misleading, too. It's just a crappy marketing move by the studios. There is no blood, gore or nudity. In fact, I don't think they even used profanity. Guess the studios didn't have the guts to let this film stand on its own merits.But, if YOU are looking for a well acted, well written and well directed movie experience, then rent this DVD.But if you are just looking for another run-of-the-mill gore fest, then go rent one of the cheap, low-budget slasher flicks littering the Blockbuster shelves instead.

264,johnyjoe,"...Yah, it's different... but does that make it good?",2,4 March 2006,"I'm not sure I'm on the same page as most reviewers here. Maybe it's that I saw this movie in my basement (in the dark), which doesn't have the same impact of a movie theater... but this movie was horrible.To some up the clichés, it's about a single blond living alone in an apartment who investigates the bizarre death of a young lady, then ends up getting in a ""spooky"" situation involving ""demons"".The movie had its creepy moments, one of which would be seeing Emily's contorted body lying on the floor, but this doesn't make up for the outrageously long court scene that is so tacky it make me laugh several times. Of course, even my childish giddiness couldn't last, as the court scenes seemed to last longer than that of a full episode of Law and Order (I think we can all agree watching a court room for over an hour is equivalent to watching pre-school play for more than twenty minutes, which is unbearable).What really bugged me about the court-room drama is the dialogue was mediocre at best, and when the scenes dragged on for over ten minutes a piece, it became more and more obvious that the research must have gone more into the exorcism than the dialogue in the court.Speaking of the exorcism, it lasted about ten to fifteen minutes, and it definitely wasn't scary. I'll admit, the scenes themselves were terrifying, but there was one thing that got in the way: The subtitles. I know everyone hates being left in the dark during movies, but really, do we need to know the demons inside Emily can count to six in four different languages? And can we not figure out from the testimony of the priest that she has demons in her without having to read it off the bottom of the screen as she screams it in German (was it German? I couldn't tell...). The subtitles took away from the mood, and drew attention from the actual horror scenes. I found myself desperately trying to read the dialogue and watch the exorcism at the same time, then afterwards I realized the subtitles told me absolutely nothing I didn't know already.In a horror movie, especially one of such potential, do we really need to focus our attention on the human aspects of it? Not that they didn't talk a lot about the supernatural aspects of Emily's condition, but... they didn't show enough of her perspective, and when they did it always ended with a close up of her face as she either screamed, frowned, or it would just show her have a seizure. The movie didn't do what I wanted it to do; go inside her mind, show her perspective. I know that the priest wanted to help, and I know that his defendant wanted to try to help him by going along with what he said, but what I didn't know was what Emily was going through. I found that disappointing, especially since I've been waiting for a movie to truly go inside the mind of someone in such a position (feverish hallucination type of thing... I mean, wouldn't that scare you more than watching a bunch of doors open and close?).There should have been more scenes like the one of Emily talking to the Virgin Mary (as seen on the cover). That scene was very well done in comparison to the rest of the movie. It was such a bizarre and artistic scene... it's a shame they felt the need to resort to cheesy looking cats attacking the priest and horses going crazy (The Ring, anyone?).So thats my honest opinion on the movie. I didn't like it at all. It wasn't scary, it was barely interesting, and it didn't break far enough from your standard cliché horror movie.K. T.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Even the most frightening scenes and events, are totally realistic and possible inside psychological pathology without having to invoke the supernatural. This is the movie's main objective, and it manages to reach it very well. All other events with a greater touch on the supernatural side, are third-person opinions and depictions of the events, thus possibly exaggerated by the biased mind of the witnesses.Second, all characters are somehow emotionally or personally involved in the story. The Defense attorney is after a promotion, then all she wants is to do the right thing because the last time she didn't. The D.A. is defending his Christian faith against ignorance and superstition. The mambo-jumbo expert on possessions is well over her head into philosophical denial and pseudo-scientific New Age fantasies. The witness doctor wants to believe in the possession because it is easier to him, than assume that he was not so experienced as he thought. The parents need to deny that their rigorous education was the cause for her daughter's suffering. Even the priest wants to believe that he was doing the right thing, because the opposite was to assume that he was a murderer. ALL of them were deluding themselves into a fantasy that clouded their judgment.As I see it: Emily Rose was a young woman with a strong sexual desire. She received a very strict education against sex, and there she was, away from her family, in an university where she could do anything (anyone?) she wanted - and she just had met a boy she liked. Why did it all happened one night when she was alone? Was it because she was fantasizing she could be making love with her boyfriend? Was she masturbating, or having any sexual fantasies? Anyway, that conflicted against her frigid education by her beloved parents. And then it struck her. Maybe she had had an argument with her boyfriend. Maybe she invited him to her room - and he denied it. Maybe she was jealous. Maybe she was hiding some shame - maybe she had lost her virginity to some guy or other and that was eroding her with guilt. No one cared to know what her troubles were. Neurologists diagnosed her as epileptic, her family called her possessed.The possession was her way to unite her family with the boyfriend. It gave her the attention she needed to the conflict between her education and her sexual desire. She even says the name of the demon was ""One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six!"" (and in more than one occasion that ""Six"" sounded more like ""Sex!"")That's why I loved this movie. It showed that reality can look a lot strange to the unaided eye, and that resorting to the superstition and the supernatural can only end in tragedy. We are all human beings, with human feelings. We need to be more attuned to these feelings, because doing so we will need no supernatural explanations to what is aching inside of each and every one of us.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
267,brooz,Based on a true story...,6,2 February 2007,"These words introduce the movie. It always gives me a bad feeling. Specially for a supernatural movie.It gives the impression that the story is true. Which is not. This movie is based on the 'Anneliese Michel' case, Deutschland, 1976.I had some fun being thrilled by this movie during its first half; But afterward, I was seeing it as an ad for Catholicism. And I think it is. I have been reading on another comment that both sides are equally represented. I can't agree with that. We see scenes where Emily Rose is possessed, speaking weird languages, suffering under contact with a cross; black cats attack the priest at the beginning of the exorcism; everybody wake up at 3:00AM with anguish;and so on. Is there a single scene that shows with humanity and compassion the side of the doctors?***********SPOILER AHEAD****************In the end, the whole argument of the movie is not valid. When, Emily Rose is proposed by Mary the choice between dying now or suffer before that, she chooses the suffering in order to prove the existence of the Devil (hence the existence of God). As long as she is possessed, she sends people toward the church. Hey! Lucifer is meant to be a smart guy! He should have guessed that the more he acts that way, the less souls he would collect. Hence Emily Rose would not have been possessed in the first place.***********SPOILER ABOVE****************Good acting, by the way.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
268,rsilverst,Not very impressive as a suspense movie,5,28 December 2005,"This movie did not have a lot that impressed me about it. The acting is not particularly good. It constantly feels like a television show rather than a movie. I kept thinking I was watching ""Law and Order"". The first half of the movie is a bit scary, but it was mostly the use of sound effects that made it scary. I know that many horror/suspense movies use auditory stimuli to heighten the fear response - but it was very transparent in this movie. In a better executed film, you don't notice that it's just the sound that is scary.The movie ceases to be scary somewhere in the middle, and then it's just silly and lame. The biggest problem I have with it is that while it claims to be a ""true story"", I think that's a pretty subjective statement. Maybe the ""story"" is based on a story that has been told about a real-life situation, but I have little doubt in my mind that demonic possession is nonsense. The girl was psychotic, and that's that :) The movie ended up seeming a bit like a sales pitch for Christianity, which bothered me as well. All in all, a weak film. I'm surprised it got so many stars as it did.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
269,kinky_friedman,A film where the problem literally lies in the title,6,22 June 2006,"***MILD SPOILERS***This movie is by no means a horror movie. Granted this film has supernatural themes in the middle, but essentially this is a tired courtroom thriller. First of all, the main lawyer (the feminist, Ally McBeal-esquire biotch) is a tired stereotype. She's out to get the big boys and beat them at their own game! This stereotypical character is in a typical problem- she has been assigned to a nutcase defendant and has to find evidence to help prove him innocent or she won't get the job she wants. Sounds familiar? It should. The basic plot has been used in every courtroom TV drama. But wait! This film would be boring without a twist! And a twist there is. Instead of having the defendant (played by Tom Wilkinson) be committing any old murder, he accidentally killed Emily Rose- a 19-year-old supposedly possessed by a demon- during an exorcism. The tale of the exorcism is laid out by testimonies in court. About 90% of this film takes place in a courtroom. The other 10% takes place at Emily Rose's house and college. Had it been reversed- having the story unfold in order, and focusing on the exorcism- this film could have been interesting. Exorcisms were interesting a few decades ago when The Exorcist came out, it would be even more interesting to see how exorcisms have evolved since then in this film. But no! This film focuses on the lawyer (ironically enough named Erin) trying to get evidence to prove the priest's innocence. The two biggest flaws are as follows. The word ""exorcist"" (or any conjugation of it) demands your brain to think of The Exorcist. The Exorcist was a powerhouse beyond any other. Truly terrifying to most people. When the producers slapped on the word ""exorcism"" on this film, they were promising a horrific experience. They failed to execute a disturbing movie, and that is why I am left with a bad impression of it. It's just not scary. The other flaw is that the movie treats the supernatural merely like a possibility. Maybe Emily was mentally ill, maybe Emily was possessed. Either way, the ending leaves you hanging and albeit confused and hypocritical. But there are some good points. Great camera works and editing. Where the film is flawed in following the lawyer's hunt for evidence, you still DO want the lawyer to find the evidence and you still DO want to know the whole story. While the story of the exorcism is far from shocking, it still is fast paced and definitely not boring. The film also has a mildly Christian message. You root for the preacher the whole thing, and the lawyer opens her eyes to the possibility of God. Perhaps she became a Christian... and the movie doesn't hide the fact it's spiritually- it blatantly displays it on the back of the box. This confuses me, because while it is spiritual, it has an unrated version... I liked this movie, but if you don't like courtroom thrillers, you simply won't like this movie. I give this movie a C.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
270,angelalyn14612,Good Movie,8,10 September 2005,"First of all this was a good movie. I wouldn't necessarily consider it a horror movie like Friday The 13th but it was suspenseful like The Ring. I had to look away sometimes because being a suspenseful movie watcher all my life I knew by the sound of the chilling music something was gonna happen that would freak me out and boy did it do its job.It wasn't overly predictable. It was a look back on what exactly happened when Emily Rose got possessed and how it ended. It wasn't a ""push the catholic belief down everyones throat"" because defending the Priest was an agnostic lawyer trying to not only get ahead in her career but convince a journey that medical science could not determine she had a medical condition but a demonic possession. Cant tell you anymore than that.The movie had a ""dark"" look and was cozy it kept me on the edge of my seat and the way she got possessed and how she looked was way freaky. Good movie and worth to own on DVD!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
271,sethian79,Good court room drama with sprinkles of good horror,6,21 February 2006,"I thought this movie had to much court room scenes and to little Emily Rose scenes. This movie was not advertised correctly, I don't remember any court room stuff in the trailers when it came out in theaters, and then I go to watch the movie expecting something more like The Exorcist and instead I get something more like The Firm or A Time To Kill. The scenes with Emily Rose were very effective and freaky, but there wasn't enough. I had this problem with The Village, a movie that turned out to be more drama then horror. I thought the movie was well done as far as acting and direction, but it did not deliver on a horror level like I expected. If the movie would have eliminated the whole court thing and been about what happened to Emily while it was happening to her instead of in flash backs then it would have been more intense and effective, I think. I would give this 6/10. Still interesting and entertaining, just didn't deliver like I thought.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
272,rawdeal007,Nothing New,6,26 March 2006,"Well, my title is a little off to begin with because a court room - horror is actually quite fresh and new. But what I meant by 'nothing new' is that the horror part of the movie has been done before in every aspect. Inevitably, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' will be compared to The Exorcist. When I first heard of the movie, I thought, like most people, that it was just going to be copycat. That's not the case here, and although it does have its similarities, it does not focus on the exorcism per se, but more on the actual character who has been 'possesed'. The movie is easy enough to watch and never gets too complicated and I didn't feel let down when it ended or overly pleased I had watched the movie.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
273,bryan220,WHOA...creepy. but good!,9,11 September 2005,"I'll start off by saying this: this is a creepy and scary movie. There u go. It is freakin' scary! there were so many of my friends who think there so great and everything and they even got scared. And so did i. This is a very GOOD movie. but not amazing. The possession of Emily is awesome! its sooo cool...but creepy. The main part of this story is not exorcising Emily, but finding out if Emily was indeed possessed or was she just having hallucinations. By this, the priest that tried to cure her was blamed for her death(not really a spoiler; u find out this in the very beginning of the movie) so he has to go to court. This isn't really all a horror. its mostly a court room drama/ a horror. But u will get freaked out most of the time. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone below 12 years old. it will be way too scary///",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
274,fotw,Would make a fine bed-time story,1,9 April 2006,"I saw this movie with a friend of mine at his place a few months ago. By the end we were both literally asleep. The flick couldn't have been more boring if it tried. ""The Exorcist"" was too boring as hell but 30 years ago everything was. A 2005 movie has no excuse to rock people to sleep (which I doubt was an intended effect). And don't even get me started on the whole faith thing - I'm tired of people trying to force religious crap down my throat, to hell with all that! That's what this is - one long, hyper-mundane, preaching piece of $#*""! Anyway I'm guessing that most people out there will miss the point (so did I actually but I couldn't have cared less about what was happening on screen) which is that God is trying to prove his own existence by proving that of Satan.

If you are oblivious to the supernatural it wont scare you at all you'll actuall find it really dumb.... cause you wont get it..but if you understand the movie and know history and thefirst book of the torah , genesis..it will scare you... there are many heart jumping moments in this the film. The actors and script are well thought out and it is well filmed. Its based on a true story of an ordinary girl called emily rose who goes off to university and comes back possessed by not one ,two , but 6 demons..each of which resided in evil characters throughout history...

277,Lord_of_all_zombies,Not A Movie About An Exorcism,9,2 August 2008,"I watched this movie expecting it to be an attempt at a gripping horror movie with startling images and ""try-to-make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat"" moments. I didn't get this. Instead, I get something MUCH better.A girl, Emily Rose, supposedly ""possessed,"" is exorcised by Father Moore, her family's reverend. Eventually, Moore convinces Emily to cease her medical remedies and begin a religious one (The exorcism, performed by Father Moore). In this process, Emily is killed and Father Moore is convicted of Negligent Homicide. The story is then in the courtroom, determining whether Father Moore is guilty of ""killing"" Emily Rose.The brilliance behind The Exorcism of Emily Rose is its debate-worthy storyline. The movie itself strikes as more of a commentary on religion and the real world. It addresses the psychological aspects of religion, as well as the scientific ones. Yet at the same time, there are aspects that are unexplained, leaving it open for people to believe what they desire. Points and counterpoints are fired back and forth on both sides of the issue, and in the end the jury comes to its decision.If I say too much, it will give it away. My suggestion would be to watch this movie very open-minded and be ready for points both FOR and AGAINST religion itself.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
278,jail_house_nurse,Excellent movie!!!,10,15 September 2005,"This is an excellent movie in most respects. The only problem I had with the movie, was the poor medical and psych research. The reference to drugs that don't exist, and the Dr.s didn't seem to understand the basics of a seizure disorder. I'm a bit naive to psychology, but the psychiatrist seemed to have less education than I on this subject.I must say that the acting and writing in this movie were superb. Anyone who likes the original exorcist, will love this movie. I was afraid of the dark for several days after watching this movie. The supernatural aspect of this movie was very thrilling. And Tom Wilkinson should get some sort of an award for this movie, he was very credible, and sincere in his role of the priest, Father Moore, in this film.

From the beginning to the end it's thrill me and still on my head for a few days even I had to googled the true story of Emily Rose which is happen for real to a German's girl. I love this movie above my horror/thriller list, and still there's a question which is an unanswered on the film, only 2 movies that makes me had the same feel about this film ""The Passion of The Christ"" and ""Eden Lake"".

Yes it might not be as good as Primal Fear, but maybe it is , maybe it's much better or just as good. The one thing you should know is that, in my opinion, this movie is worth watching. You can find in ""The exorcism of Emily Rose"" good directing, wonderful acting and a decent screenplay. Besides, Laura Linney looks terrific....I think she looks better and better each day.

The plot of this movie is also good. This movie consist of many opinions about devout catholic and like a epileptic syndrome. In this movie, you can not say Emily Rose got demonic possession in the court because the judges didn't believe that thing. So Father Moore must face what his ""did"" to Emily Rose.

283,moskwiz,Do You believe?,10,27 August 2006,"Despite the fact, that this movie is largely built upon the effect of 'scaring the pants off you,' which, I might say, it does a rather good job at, this movie also includes a well-developed storyline and what is more important - it involves the viewer. I am a big fan of horror movies and I often rate horror flicks by the ability of the story to effect the viewer. Could this happen to me?! One couldn't really say that movies like 'Dawn Of The Dead' or 'The Blair Witch Project' effect the viewer personally unless they were a Blair resident or in-fact a person of sort undead. Watching this movie however, at a point, the viewer has to ask him/herself a question, yes worn out, but still - do I believe? And at that point you find yourself asking much more than if a man is guilty of a crime or not.The world as we know it, is b a s e d on duality. Be it between good and evil, wrong and right, indeed the god and the devil or whatever other polarities; in the end we all must choose a side. After you have watched this movie, which you really should (preferrably in the dark, alone, around 3 am), ask yourself another question - who do Y o u think represented who in this trial of everlasting duality?I am not saying this movie made me a believer or that it could or should. However if you have yet not asked yourself that eventually unavoidable question, this movie should force that question into a queue that must be answered in the end.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a brilliant example of a true horror movie, made with modern technology. The effect-to-point ratio is just right. People have seen too many zombies, mutants, monsters etc. by now and I am glad to see that the classic, psychological horror theme is returning to the genre. Let's just hope this marks a new wave in horror-industry and we can finally start enjoying horror-movies with more point and less Humanoids from the Deep.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

However, after viewing it, the scenes showed during previews were the only scary scenes throughout the movie.By midway into the movie, I was trying to figure out whether the point of the movie was to give me a fright, or convince me that Emily Rose was so Godly...that she was possessed by Demons...Maybe one of the biggest oxymorons of all time. There were definitely some startling parts, but once faith started entering into the film, it was the beginning of the end for me. Then to end on the quote ""Emily's story is being told to thousands today,"" made me felt that I was just coerced into seeing a movie to try to convince to believe a girl who had gone loony.

Which isn't to say this film is not scary- some scenes are genuinely unsettling, and all the credit should go to Jennifer Carpentar who plays the possessed Emily Rose as good as any since Linda Blair. To its credit the acting is also quite good and with thespians such as Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson it better be.

286,jt19992012,"Terribly directed, edited and photographed...a disaster almost saved by Christopher Young's music",2,11 May 2014,"This is a perfect example of what happens when you have a no-talent, clueless director trying to tell a story, working from a decent script, but not having the slightest idea of how to make a good movie out of it. Jeff Bettancourt's editing is absolutely horrid, too -- hundreds of shots too long or too short -- mostly too short. Didn't we learn ANYTHING from Stanley Kubrick??!!! Guess not.But even worse than the incompetent directing and horrendous editing is the vomit-inducing photography from Tom Stern. The courtroom scenes look like something from an industrial video. I've seen porno that looks better than this. There are tons and tons of murky, underexposed and grainy shots. Then there are lots of horrible Shakicam shots, the type Stern would later use to completely destroy ""The Hunger Games.""I mean, was someone actually looking at the rushes each day, staring at this garbage, clapping each other on the back and saying: ""Yeah! Yeah!! Perfect, Tom! Looks fantastic!!!"" And don't even get me started on how he lit Laura Linney! She should have sued for malicious defamation of image. If Dietrich or Garbo or Monroe had been photographed like this, they would have ended up extras. If'd shot anyone like this in film school, they would have thrown me out of the department after whipping me for wasting precious film stock.What Tom Stern does -- what he's always done -- is use high-speed stocks, then underexpose them by using almost no lights. I guess that's his attempt to emulate the ""Prince of Darkness,"" Bruce Surtees. Nice try, Tom -- It didn't work. The resulting image is almost always dark, blurry, grainy and horrifically underexposed. It basically looks like someone shot a 16mm industrial film on 20 year-old unrefrigerated ECO stock, then decided to push it five stops. The drag it through mud. Great work, Tom. How much were you paid again?But I don't put the blame solely on Stern. I blame it on the idiot director -- the half-wit responsible for one of the worst films in the history of cinema, ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake.Somehow Stern did a good job on films like ""Gran Torino"" and a number of other excellent Eastwood films.What was needed here was someone with just a fraction of Eastwood's talent and taste, telling Stern what he wanted. A great cinematographer, like Deschanel or Roizman or Storraro or Zsigmond or Bartkowiac, naturally knows how to do fantastic work that helps tell the story in a dramatic and powerful way.Stern, on the other hand, is basically a gaffer, thousands of miles away from the brilliance of these world-class DPs.And when you have a gaffer basically responsible for telling a story on film, you better have a genius director supervising and telling him what you want. Or at least someone smart enough to say, ""These dailies like complete crap, Tom -- get on the ball, fast, or you'll be cleaning the studio toilets by tomorrow night.""If someone doesn't say things like this, a film cab get into serious trouble.Hence, ""Emily Rose.""",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
287,miknnik,Cerebral Horror Film,9,26 March 2007,"I checked the IMDb information on The Exorcism of Emily Rose and learned that it had won two awards in the best horror film category. I'm glad it did because I believe it deserves them, and maybe more accolades. I've always loved reading Gothic horror stories, but the horror movies are almost always disappointing to me. Many of the horror movies are gory but otherwise laughable, almost comical--Friday the 13th for instance. Some others are based on a certain faith and may trigger fear in some viewers, but it may not have the same effect on those who do not follow the doctrine. I confess, I thought The Exorcist was pretty absurd. But not The Exorcism of Emily Rose, no. Several different factors contributed to this film's riveting story. First, the cast, naturally. Laura Linney never fails to deliver a good performance no matter how small or difficult her role is. In the role of Erin Bruner, she is very persuasive, as a defense attorney as well as an actress. In The Exorcist, Max von Sydow's Father Merrin looks and is portrayed like almost a mythical being himself, but in Emily Rose, Father Moore is just another priest, who firmly believes poor Emily is possessed. Tom Wilkinson plays him convincingly. Jennifer Carpenter is simply amazing as Emily. I bet she, without any grotesque makeup or special effect, scared a whole lot more people than any other monsters or ghosts did in the recent horror film history. Campbell Scott, however, does not look or sound like a ""shrewd son of a bitch,"" aka Ethan Thomas, a prosecutor, who is known to shred the opponent in the courtroom. If you ask me, Erin Bruner really beat the crap out of the D.A. Another brilliant aspect of this movie is that it does not side with either the sacred or the secular and forces us, believers and non-believers alike, to think not only what and who to believe but also what 'the reality' is. In other horror flicks, we must accept certain premises: Catholic teachings; that Jason will never die; that a vampire is a blood-sucking shape-shifter that can be killed only by a stake through the heart, the sunlight, etc. If you don't believe in them, the stories are merely nonsense. But in Emily Rose, the viewers are like the jurors in the courtroom--we are there to think and judge for ourselves. If you have ever studied anthropology, you probably know that 'the reality' is not quite the same for everyone and in every culture. Most of us scoff at the notion of a voodoo curse, but there are records of the deaths of some voodoo believers who passed away shortly after they learned that they had been cursed. Those cases document that the victims were in perfect health, but their bodies simply shut down. Was it psychosomatic? Most likely. But I can almost hear Erin Bruner asking, ""Is it possible....?""",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
288,Isaiah53-1,Pleasantly Surprised,8,10 September 2005,"Like most that went to see this movie I was expecting ""The Exorcist"" re-incarnated. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case at all. As you well know by now the movie centers around a courtroom drama involving Emily (Carpenter) who died after a failed exorcism attempt. Being Catholic, I was extremely happy to finally see a Hollywood production where the Church is not portrayed as the ""big bad Catholic Church"". Fr. Moore (Wilkinson) is portrayed as a loving, caring man of God; who (like most Priests) care deeply for their parishioners. The film is pretty much theologically correct, the only exception being the fact that Exorcisms are always performed with at least two Priests. I enjoyed this slower, non-gory, non-sexual, non-profane, tale whose suspense pulled you in from the beginning and held you until the end. Incidentally, I did a little research on the net and discovered the movie was based on the real life experience of a German-born girl named Anneliese Michal who died in 1976. I am sure the director took some artistic-liberty in telling the tale, but in all it was an excellent film. I am sick to death of CGI, over the top, dead children/ghosts horror movies.

290,Maidenmayhem23,The best film of 2005,10,16 January 2006,"I watch nothing but horror, so 2005 was a fairly dull year for me, only one good movie, The Skeleton Key, and the rest (Amityvile Horror remake, White Noise) all left a very bad taste in my mouth. However this movie probably saved me. The Exocism of Emily Rose, as most know, is a true story based on what happened to a young girl in Germany. When I decided to watch it, I thought it was going to be a cheap rip-off of The Exorcist, oh how wrong I was. In fact, I might go as far as saying this film is even BETTER than The Exorcist. The sights that Emily sees while possessed are extremely creep, the blured out face, black bleeding eyes and looked very sik(the good way). The acting is terrific, and I truly felt sympathy for Father Moore as he told the story. I also felt a great deal of sympathy for poor Emily, she was just 3 years (I'm 16) older than me and just knowing that something like that could happen to me at any time truly terrified me. The reason I give this a 10 is because I see very little flaws in this great movie. A new classic.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
291,cranny0414,"Ho-Hum, Another Diappointment",3,10 September 2005,"As I sat on the couch one night, my husband and I sat through a very interesting ""coming attraction"" called ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"".... We just looked at each other, and marked the release date on the calender.I wish we hadn't.First and foremost the previews shown do not tell you that this movie actually takes place in the courtroom. 60-70% of this movie is the attorney's and witness testimony. The only images you get of Emily is the flashback they show of the exorcism during the trial. I will admit, some of the images and the sounds during the exorcism did give me goose-bumps, some of the special effects were OK, but that's it. This movie did not grab my attention; in fact I found myself waking my husband up... HONESTLY. He feel asleep twice during the movie! I felt like I was watching CourtTV!! I like to watch drama's, but this was so hyped up to be a ""Horror"" and the only ""horror"" there was is the fact that I paid to sit and watch it. Unbelievable!! I just wish SOMEONE would come out with a true ""horror"" movie! We left the show just shaking our heads. We couldn't believe it. One good thing did come out of going to see it though... my husband and I spent some good quality time together...playing in the arcade! In my opinion... save your money... wait till it comes out on one of your movie channels through your cable company... that way you can turn the channel.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Just like there is only one Madonna, one Cher and one Bjork, there is only one Exorcist with no room or need for another.Lots of pointless screaming and bad acting by Emily, it all looked so silly and just could not draw me in. A lot of blatant copies of scenes from The Exorcist and even dialog. Big waste of time and money on the part of everyone involved. I guess if you had never seen the original, this might work for you, but it was more like an episode of LA Law or Boston Legal. It was work getting through it.

293,pinkishdarko,Thought through. Interesting and frightening,8,4 October 2005,"I read thousands of reviews of Emily Rose before going to see it and they all said that is was terrible. Two of them quoted ""One of the worst experiences of my life."" and ""I fell asleep in the first ten minutes and woke up when the credits came up.""Ihad actually planned to go see Flight PLan that day, but it was sold out so I sadly went to go see Emily Rose. I was shocked at how different my opinion and the critics opinion varied.I thought the movie was clever and filled with interesting information. Whoever played Emily ROse did a pretty damn good job as well, even though all she did was scream and have nervous breakdowns. I did like the main woman's character, but she wasn't my favorite. It actually wasn't as scary as I had planned, but I definitely sat at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Overall, the story is very controversial and interesting and i loved thinking it all through on my drive home.

294,DrFontane,The Propaganda of Emily Rose,2,22 February 2010,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is an OK film. It is occasionally nicely done and would indeed be scary if I had seen it alone. However, some things are downright ridiculous and the plot focuses far too much on the trial, which is full of religious propaganda.I would like to make an ethical note on this film of exactly that: I think it is very representative for how the medium of film lends itself very easily to such a purpose. I'd like to share some notes on it, because many films play on something similar. Before I begin my note, I'll first justify why I at all bother (apart from the fact that I enjoy it). We draw experience and moral lessons not just from our own experience, but from the experience within films as well; If not literally or consciously, then still unconsciously. Considering its experience was brought to us by a writer rather than life, it can't hurt to be even wearier of what it teaches us.The Exorcism of Emily Rose is inspired by the true story of Anneliese Michel. Let me first say that I love films that are ""inspired by a true story"", if not only because almost every film ever made is inspired by a true story in some way. Emily Rose and Anneliese Michel share a fate, being that they suffered from either possession or a severe medical condition (most likely a form of epilepsy) and died of either the unsuccessful exorcism or the medical negligence of her condition. The film focuses on two interlocked story lines: one being the exorcism of Emily Rose (in the past) and the other a trial of her priest, being accused of negligent homicide (in the present).What's very convenient about films is that they have the capacity to already make its premises true before they even begin to argue (and this film clearly tries to make an argument). We already know that the priest is a good man who did the right thing in carrying out his exorcism, because Emily Rose was quite clearly possessed (as we've been shown). In court, he is opposed by someone who tries to explain everything ""scientifically"". There's already quite a manipulative setup in that this guy makes a questionable use of the words ""facts"" and ""evidence"". The film ends with the previous skeptic lawyer who makes an even more questionable speech about ""facts"" and doubt. I'll quote a part of it:""The prosecution wants you to believe that Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder was a fact because facts leave no room for reasonable doubt. But this trial isn't about facts. This trial is about possibilities. Is it a fact that Emily was a hypersensitive as Dr. Adani suggests? A person who's more likely, by her very nature, to become possessed? I can't say that, but the question is: Is it possible?"" () ""Is Father Richard Moore guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, of negligent homicide? Did he, in fact, neglect Emily's needs in such a way that her death is now on his hands? No! That is not a fact. The only fact the only thing I know beyond a doubt in this case is that Father Moore loved Emily with his whole heart.""I find that use of ""fact"" and especially the morality of it not only questionable, but dangerous. I can agree with her on one thing: Emily's psychotic epileptic disorder isn't a fact. It's a fact that there was something going on with her, but a psychological disorder (I'm not a doctor, I'm not going to advocate that specific condition) has a probability much higher than possession. There should indeed always be room for doubt, but it is amazing how often science is accused of having all the answers when it is faith that claims to have the absolute truth (without ""reasonable doubt"") while science always starts from that very doubting perspective, moving up the ladder of probability (not certainty).The argument of the film is as follows: ""The priest was in the right, because his superstition is true. Then that means he would be convicted while being innocent."" This is an argument often found in films dealing with any form of the supernatural. There is always an annoying skeptic who is wrong because the superstition is right. We are almost taught that we shouldn't be that guy who didn't believe it and should have listened from the start. But even with the priest being right in the film, I would argue there wouldn't be any good reason for the judge to be on his side.There should always be room for doubt, but that doesn't imply every possibility is an equally probable one. If there would be ten witnesses of the rape and murder of a girl, with the accused having her blood on his hands and his semen in her temple of womanliness, there would still be the possibility that the minds of ten people played tricks on them and he was set-up in some way. However, that's so unlikely that the evidence before us suggests a high probability he's guilty. Considering we're not all-knowing that's not a perfect system, but it's the best we got to have as least innocent people accused as possible. One last irony I'd like to point out is that the reason we know the priest is in the right is because the film shows us the evidence of it. Why not leave some room for doubt on that?",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
295,HarVSatan,Demons Need Exorcising? Bore Them To Death!,1,18 September 2005,"Good Gravy! What a flat and boring piece of celluloid this film is! Laura Linney & Tom Wilkinson,prove they are exceptional actors,but they are stuck in a thanklessly boring story.When I saw the trailers,I assumed,that this was NOT going to be like ""The Exorcist"",that would've been a fools course. That's the one good thing,they didn't try to go beyond the supposed ""true story"". But this comes off about as ""true"" as ""The Amittyville Horror"".The characters don't hold your attention. You don't really care too much about ""Emily Rose"" as she is too under developed as a character to be concerned about. ( Her boyfriend has better character development!). The promises of ""horrors"" are nothing more than what you see in the trailers! (i.e. people's faces distorting ). ""The Devil"" appears in shadows and silhouettes as a cloaked figure...an interesting device,if it hadn't been done a million times before.Then there is the bulk of the film,which is about an hour and a half of courtroom drama. Really boring courtroom drama. Perry Mason would've solved this in minutes! Another curiosity about this film is that it gives you no specific time-line. If it's based on a ""true story"",WHEN did it take place? There's really no clues to the era. It's obviously post 1970,but we are told little beyond that.There probably IS a really good draft of this story,with developed characters,and less courtroom babble...but this ain't it!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
296,nima-azad,It's not about reality or anything,3,11 August 2018,"The exorcism of Emily Rose states ""based or true events "". It's not. It's a fictional story loosely related to a sad story which happened actually in Germany. 
There is been always struggle between believers and non-believers. But there is a line which Agnostics stands. And there is a vast spectrum here. Anyway, as an audience there are major significations between those lines. As an Agnostic one which prefer to be a believer by the reason not faith, this film was bothering. Let's tell you way.A young girl tragically dies during a so called exorcism ritual. She stopped taking medicine before she got worse. Clearly she suffered from something but that was not supernatural. Our brain is very sensitive and complicated. It can be learned to how perceive and see the world inside and outside us. Emily raised in a Catholic family. She majorly learned how to believe the world she lived in. She suffered pain? Yes, but that was her mentality state. If see felt happiness that was a mental state too.People see and hear things that others could not. They are special in their mental states not in personality or state of being. The have distorted images from their minds and no clues to separate them from each other or understand them. So they need ""unknown ""to explain it. When we have a headache 
something happened in our body. No entity from outside tries to occupies our life. When the pain grows we will try to find the reason. Pain needs attention not rituals. In serious events it will need more attention and close treatment. But there is no spiritual treatment for that except finding peace for our body and mind. 
At the end, this film was so disappointing. Clearly says that something happened from outside and something from outside our hands ended it. But in a good way, by the life a young innocent girl to suffer. Sadistic ...",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Thing is because it is based on a true story, you wonder how much of it was true. Even if it was a small part it still makes me wonder could we be possessed like the character or even the real life person who it was based on.I have watched many scary horror films in my time and many of them to me were comical. I just find comedy in horror (probably because it helps me get through the film a lot easier). I remember watching 'The Exorcist' at age twelve and I think then it was less scary than when I watched it recently. But this film, it kind of sucks you in, you get involved with the characters and then you start to believe the film adaptation of the real life person from this 'based on a true story' story is actually real.I watched this film on my own and when the film finished it was exactly 3.00 a.m. in the morning which is the part scared me. Let's just say I was sniffing around the house for smoke and checking all the doors and leave it at that. A well crafted film, very real and sure to scare you. If you like films like 'Chainsaw Massacre' then maybe this film may not scare you but if you liked the film 'The Exorcist' then watch this film.

301,deadlypen,An Embarrassingly Bad Movie,1,1 April 2006,"This is a movie that attempts to combine the horror and courtroom genres and falls flat on its face somewhere in a yawning void between them. The supposedly 'horrific' scenes are devoid of chills, shocks or atmosphere; the scenes in court are without tension or credibility. None of the cast come across as real characters; most of the acting could be described as sub-par for a daytime soap opera.The writers (who also occupied the Director's and Producer's chairs) said that they made a deliberate decision to avoid using a 'look and feel' that might be considered too familiar by horror fans. One example they gave of this concept in action was the rejection of school locations with Gothic architecture in favour of a more ordinary, everyday building and campus. Unfortunately, they took the ploy too far and ended up choosing settings which had no ability to create mood or cause suspension of disbelief at any level. The school buildings were reminiscent of one of those indoor car parking facilities built out of bad concrete; the only thing to be said in their favour was that, unlike the courtroom set, they didn't make me think that the walls would wobble if one of the cast bumped into them.The (not so) special effects were no doubt intended to be subtle; in fact, they were so subtle that they made no impact whatsoever. A child with a Walmart Halloween play-set could probably have devised a more impressive spectacle.There are unintentionally funny moments when the writers wish to impress us with the cut and thrust of the opposing lawyers' eloquence. A great screenwriter can sometimes take weak, banal or vapid material and use pace, action or the sheer power of well-crafted words to distract us and hold us to the end of the picture - but this movie does not have the advantage of anything remotely like a good script. Consequently, we are all too aware of every clanking, clunking line...and there are many of them - all delivered by actors whose performances range from ham to cardboard. When so many players in one production fail to register as believable characters, the Director must be held accountable.The best horror films succeed by taking their audiences out of the real world and replacing normal logic with the story's own internal laws and rules - in such a way that we can be sucked into accepting unreal situations as real. A skillful writer would not wish to constantly stop the flow of the narrative and keep on reminding the viewer of alternative interpretations - but that is exactly what happens in this film. It is a scrappy, unsatisfying and shoddy effort.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
302,Luminaria,"Excellent - frightening - but because of the possibilities, not the special effects...",9,19 April 2006,"My son gave me this movie for Christmas. It's taken me 4 months to be ""in the mood"" to watch what I thought was going to be a gruesome horror movie - well, silly me! It's not gruesome. It *is* horrible, though, watching the terrible things that happen to Emily Rose as she goes through the torments inflicted on her. Knowing that the story is based on true events made everything much more frightening. Just a few nits to pick - I wished that they had included a little bit more information about the actual case at the end - such as the ""when/where"". I can see why they didn't want to release the girl's name. But everyone knows that now anyway.... I just think it would have helped the movie viewer to have a simple statement, such as ""The film is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, a young German woman who died in 1976. She believed she was possessed by six or more demons, and after 4 years of medical and inpatient psychiatric treatment, she turned to the Church for help. She died after a series of exorcisms were unsuccessful. The autopsy report stated that her death was caused by the malnutrition and dehydration that resulted from almost a year of semi-starvation. Other theories suggest she might have suffocated due to side-effects of the powerful drugs she took."" The film was so much more simplistic than even these basic facts. Emily has only one session of exorcism. We never see the priest apply for permission from his bishop - nor do we see the extensive requirements for exorcism which the Church requires - such as ruling out medical and psychiatric causes for the ""symptoms"" BEFORE permission will be granted for the rite of exorcism. I really wish that this had been made more clear.But over all - movie is very well done - and the point is very well made. The lawyer's closing statements to the jury says it all - it's not the facts of the case we need to look at, but the possibilities - and the possibility being raised here is that maybe evil isn't just the absence of good, or the making of poor choices - maybe evil is also an active force in the world. Maybe there really are demons - and they really do hate us - and they really do prowl the world seeking the ruin of our souls. And maybe their best weapon of all is the fact that even so-called ""people of faith"" - like the Prosecutor - don't believe in them any more, don't even accept the possibility that they exist.

The murder took place in the form of an exorcism performed because of the girl's epilepsy and borderline personality.I could have accepted the concept of plain horror movie based on that story, but to turn this sad event into a defence for cold religious fanatics that killed in the name of God - and for two of them even their own daughter - makes me wanna p***.Taking into consideration the fact, that more and more innocent people are being killed directly and indirectly by religious fanatics of various kinds through wars and acts of terrorism, just makes the purpose of this film even more disgusting.If you want to see a horror movie about exorcism go see an ""The Exorcist"" movie - if you want to see the true story about the case this movie claims to be based on go see the German movie ""Requim"" (2006).",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
304,mac4lyfe,Some scary moments but slows down at the end.,7,29 August 2005,"(this review contains spoilers) I just saw a pre screening of TEER. The movie is about the so called possession and subsequent death of a college student during an exorcism.The priest that conducted the exorcism is under trial for her death and we have a courtroom drama over the event. The first 2/3 of the movie was great and was building momentum only to slow down the last 1/3. We don't get much info into how she became possessed, why she was alone in her dorm at the time, or why she allowed the devil in... but there were some genuine scary moments especially when you thought she, Laura Linney's character and /or the priest were going to meet the devil. This suspense more then makes up for the slow courtroom ending. The film didn't try to pass judgement either way as to whether she was or wasn't possessed, leaving it up to the viewer. It never really answered whether Linney's character actually believed her client (the Priest) nor did it give much credible evidence to prove or disprove the event. The courtroom was where the movie bogged down. This was a basic prosecution/defense debate with a very predictable ending. The ending was also very flat leaving a lot of questions unanswered. The devil was apparently after Linney but somehow stopped...The screening I attended did not have the priest say ""no injection of the devil"", nor was there any levitation (that I read occurred elsewhere). There was also nothing about her body being exhumed to find a decomposed corpse which the catholic church said meant that she wasn't possessed (since the possessed do not decompose)There was no gory, bloody, graphic effects other then a twisting, stiff twitching of her body at times. All in all an entertaining movie that does an OK job of suspense minus the courtroom drama. 6.5 out of 10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
305,time_waster,"""Inspired by a true story,"" but Facts Don't Matter?",4,12 September 2005,"This movie didn't suck, and the acting was great all around. That's about all the good I can say about it. I would have enjoyed it as a halfway-decent thriller or a courtroom drama more if it hadn't claimed to be based on a real story. But when Laura Linney says during trial that ""this case is not about facts,"" that summed up about everything wrong with the religious apologists I've seen in the media lately, from George W. Bush to the Kansas Board of Education. This idea that facts don't matter has poisoned cultural discourse for the last decade or more: some people seem to think that, as long as we have Faith, our negligent fact-checking won't lead to any wrongdoing.It would be one thing if writer/director Scott Derrickson and co-writer Paul Harris Boardman simply presented the ""facts don't matter"" tactic as part of the defense's legal strategy, but they add details to the story that try to shore this argument up. To its credit, the story concludes with the priest being found guilty of negligent manslaughter, which is apparently what happened in the real-life case in Germany. Weighing against this are the made-up story details about Linney's and Tom Wilkinson's characters being plagued by evil signs and visions, and the attending physician being killed just as he tells Linney that he sees the demons. Combined with Hollywood pop-psychology (""schizophrenics never know they're schizophrenic""), these would be workable, if clichéd, in a movie that admitted it was solely fiction, but here they serve only as a crutch to prop up the sagging drama and as evidence of the screenwriters' bias.The acting was excellent, but, not having seen Hellraiser: Inferno, I can't say that this is due to the direction. I do know that Laura Linney has handled herself well before in Mystic River and You Can Count on Me, and Tom Wilkinson was great in In the Bedroom and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; here, they clearly pick up the slack left by the script. Wilkinson, in particular, plays the best Flawed Holy Avenger since Jason Miller. It is not an easy thing to come up with a convincing character when the story around you is thin, but they manage to do it. Relative newcomer Jennifer Carpenter did fine as Emily, although her role consisted mostly of contorting herself and screaming hysterically. I really felt for her at moments, thinking that, regardless of whether it was demons or psychosis that ailed her, it was horrifying to think what she must have been going through.That emotional level got me through the movie. The storytelling shortcuts and the intellectual dishonesty grated against me, but I was able to cope with it for the two hours or so that I sat there. If only it hadn't claimed to be based on real events, it could have told a better story, and more honestly.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

A girl really went through this. A girl really did die during her exorcism. In real life they never concluded whether she was really possessed by six demons including Satan. I thought the movie was performed very well. However I feel they should have added at least another fifteen minutes of Emily's story. The acting was amazing. The reality of it was astounding. However anyone could tell that the doctor was going to die. I feel this movie should win best true story of the year. This movie is much better than the Exorcist. It really makes you ask yourself whether she had epileptic psychosis or was possessed. The scene in the church where the building bleeds and the Priest barely makes it out terrifying. Especially when he sees Satan staring at him. Its also creepy that during the possession shes speaking all kinds of languages that she supposedly knew. Small subtleties like that make you wonder. Emily's story only has a duration of about half an hour. The rest of the movie takes place in a courtroom. If you rent the movie on DVD the title screen shows the barbed wire fence dripping blood which conflicts the stigmata belief of the story. Choosing that as a title screen is good evidence that somebody doesn't believe she was possessed. Overall I thought this movie was shocking, gripping, exciting, and a good tribute to Emily's memory. AS long as you remember that this is a true story you can feel the intense emotion that would have been there. I give it an A+!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
310,yancyscott1,What I needed from a film,7,5 May 2006,"Finally a chance to see this one on DVD this week compelled to write about it because I will be going to see An American Haunting this weekend and I have see references in reviews to this movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see that The Exorcism of Emily Rose was a 'horror' film that not only has a brain for a change, but actually succeeds in being frightening. It may help that the film is allegedly based on true events, which gives credibility to the storyline, and prevents the movie from having those annoyingly gaping plot holes, it will be interesting putting this up against An American Haunting, from what I have read there are similar characteristics. There are certain events happening in the film which are questionable as to whether they actually occurred in real life, but the characters do help to pull it off and keep you moving forward, even if you did stop and wonder for a brief moment.I found 'Emily Rose' to be different from almost every past horror movie in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable, they are effects you have seen in half a dozen other horror films attempting to pull of the same scare moment. The cast gives an overall strong performance and I would recommend this film to other horror/drama fans.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

They said horror movie are made to frighten u any ways but people judge them on the basis the 'terrifying creatures' that tend to scare them but I changed my preseption about these movies and believe me it still awesome without the appearance of those cretures. I love this movie (as I watched this alone at 1 O clock) , I love how the movie works in both the place, 1st in the court room and the incident happened to Emily.

The fact that the movie was said to be based on actual events fed my curiosity, but also led to my total disappointment. Instead of focusing on the tragedy of this poor girl that was slowly tortured to death during nine (9!) month the movie followed nearly exclusively the priests character (using the vehicle ""lawyer"") without thematizing any of the horrors he brought over his victim. YES, this could have been a horror-film if the court-parts had delivered some insight into the helplessness of obsolete institutions and their followers dealing with reality and opposition. But sadly, the movie never uses this opportunity and thus sinks itself because it fails to give us somebody to suffer with. And without this identification the movie is a mere advertisement for the catholic church - just not as openly announced as for example one recent Mel Gibson film. THIS really scares me so in the end I have to admit: the movie did the job.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
313,shaws4god,Great Film. Incredibly Unsettling. 89 out of 100,10,10 August 2006,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose caught me off guard. I thought I was in for a thriller/horror movie with the same old Hollywood elements. Man, was I wrong.The Exorcism, of Emily Rose is a movie based on the real life story of Emily Rose, a young lady who headed off for college and ended up losing her mind or being possessed by Lucifer...you decide.All the elements of a great film are there: wonderful storytelling, incredible acting, good pacing, and entrancing visuals. Jennifer Carpenter (as Emily Rose) puts in one of the best acting performances I have seen in a while. I am headed to find more movies with Carpenter in them as I write. Laura Linney as Erin Bruner and Tom Wilkinson as Father Moore are strong as well.Make no mistake, the Exorcism of Emily Rose is not a horror movie, per se. But...it is very scary. I found this movie more unsettling than any horror movie I have watched this year, and I have watched many. The scene with Erin Bruner in her home was amazingly tense. Also note that there is no blood and gore in the film. This is not a film with average frights, as it may linger in the minds of even seasoned fright buffs. I went to bed after the film (I work second shift), rolled over to look at the alarm clock, and it read 2:59. It turned 3 AM as I looked. I had to get up and check all the doors in the house. I was truly creeped out.I guess the fright in the film comers from the fact that it could happen to any of us. It also comes from the unknown. Was Emily crazy?Anywho, I can't say enough good about this film. It is a court drama, a story about people you will care about, and one heck of a frightening and unsettling film that tackles huge questions about God and demons.Total Score (out of 100) = 8948 (out of 50).

It was tired, cliché and showed me absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen many times before.The court room scenes were boring to begin with but the soon lapsed into the realm of the ridiculous (Father Moore reads a letter in which Emily describes talking to the virgin mary) and the seriously tedious (any of the court scenes in the second half).The only thing that offered any kind of reprieve from the banality of the above was the actual possession sequences, Which started off well but then built up to a massive anti-climax (especially after i have been reading so many comments on here stating that the 'Barn scene' is so 'Disturbing', which it definitely was not). I was left thinking, is this IT, is that ALL!!!!! Do not listen to anybody who tells you that this movie is a masterpiece, or even anyone that tells you it is good.

I personally sat and laughed through the entire film, it was that bad. I'd say the worst film I've seen this year so far in the theatres. I think if this is what is considered as a new quality horror film, we're in serious trouble. Mind you it's not even that much of a horror film, it's a horribly idiotic and corny drama that spends half it's time in an ""okay"" horror story and the other half in the most atrocious made for TV/student film-ish courtroom drama. It was all drivel that came off really ignorant, I kept expecting Campbell Scott to say ""Objection your honor, this is clearly SHENANIGANS!"" It was a brutal film and unless you want a good laugh and you've just seen too many good quality films that you can't take one more then go see this. Otherwise spend your money on something else.

It really told the story of Emily Rose. I'm sure it won't be as entertaining for those that do no believe in the supernatural but those of you that do believe in this sort of thing, then it'll hit you a little harder. The scenes of Emily's possession were by natural scary and will probably leave you with a really uneasy feeling when you go home that night. The actors performances were good for the type of movie this way...don't expect any academy awards for this one. Everyone played their role and they played it well.

318,akillmzeier,Not what I expected -- but good,8,15 September 2005,"I went to see this film on opening weekend because I didn't really have anything else to do. I had seen the trailers and was expecting an Exorcist rip-off (as if we don't have enough of those already). Anyway I was surprised to realize that The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a courtroom drama. I know several reviewers on this site have complained about this fact. They thought they were going to a horror film as it had been advertised. I actually enjoyed this movie. I guess I went into it with little or no expectations. I was impressed by both the writer and director's ability to explore different sides of the argument. A priest is on trial for the ""negligent homicide"" of Emily Rose as a possible result of an exorcism he performed on her. The prosecution's arguments are based on science and medical testimony -- whereas the defense has to find some way to validate the priest's faith-driven actions. It is a complicated web of epilepsy, schizophrenia, pharmaceuticals, arcane Roman rites, and extreme Cathoilicism. The resulting courtroom dialogs I found engrossing on both a mental and emotional level. Well written and thorough. There is an open mindedness here that I find refreshing.As for the possession scenes -- I have to admit I found them pretty damn scary. I'm fairly jaded from a childhood of watching intense horror movies so it takes something special to give me a chill. I think the reason these scenes are so frightening lies in the duality of possibilities: Emily Rose is either possessed by a supernatural being, or she is so mentally and physically ill that she is able to destroy herself from within. I find the latter just as chilling as the former.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
319,neil-hargreaves,More courtroom drama than chilling horror,6,18 December 2005,I went to the midnight showing of this movie at my local cinema hoping that the film lived up to some of the hype I'd read over the past few weeks.The trailer looked promising enough and as I settled into my seat I fully expected a roller-coaster ride of exorcismic fun.Unfortunately the couple of parts that made you jump had already been in the trailers and the remaining content of the movie settled around the courtroom where argument was put forward but in no real detail.The actual exorcism was not scary really and again merely highlighted a good opportunity missed.I don't know if any of it was accurate to the real story - I've read up but can't decide whether this movie tried to stick to the facts and lost the impact or whether this movie went for Hollywood excitement and failed.And the bits about the female lawyer getting scared at 3am was just silly.I'm glad I saw it - but wouldn't watch it again.Overall - my score - 6 out of 10,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
320,CrookedStairs,A Crooked Stairs Review: The Exorcism Of Emily Rose,10,18 February 2019,"Let's get this one put to bed. More years ago now than I care to remember, I sat down in a movie theatre with a friend for a very late night showing of a new horror release. Loving the genre as much as I do, I was pretty excited for what was to come but equally having noticed the lack of significant promotion for the new release with largely unknown cast and crew I was fairly sure I was in for another mediocre ride...
BASIC PLOT: A young bright girl from a poor background goes off to study at college. However she soon finds herself caught up in ever increasingly violent and terrifying attacks while on and off campus from a seemingly unseen force. When things escalate and both the Courts and the Church get involved, the only question becomes what truly happened and why...REVIEW: I will be honest from the get-go. This movie has become my line of measure for *newer* horror releases and for me also one of the best horror films I have seen that has ever been released. I say that having been a horror fan for 20 years so please do allow me to clarify.The story and screenplay itself are the key to the movies success. Although the movie doesn't start in a particularly slow manner, all the necessary information is translated quickly and effectively in a few opening scenes. We see the fragile family and key characters, and the audience cares from the start. From there, (without giving too much away) the story is so fantastic and unique because it is so open to interpretation, as the court section of the film conveys. The story shows both sides of the same tale in places, each terrifying in its own way, with the weight squarely on the viewer as to what they feel is taking place. Ethier way what the script effectively does is draw the viewer into the story and makes them become more emotionally attached to the characters while battling what they feel is the truth.Technically, it's an absolute joy to watch. This movie is Scott Derrickson making his directorial mark in horror, littering the film with dark and ominous shots guaranteed to get the blood going. Incredible lighting making use of Derrickson's soon to be trademark of eerie coloured lighting in certain scenes (look out for strong purple lighting in key scenes here and what it may represent). The sound and score is subtlety so unnerving, building more on slow tingly terror than bigger dramatic moments, but there certainly are moments also... The editing is fantastic, keeping a strong pace to keep even a casual viewer engaged but slow enough for someone who's really into the storyline to also gain more information when needed.The acting is probably the biggest surprise. In horror, if you don't have the actors let's face it, you don't have the movie. The fact that the 'big 3' in this film came from an entirely different world to horror, indeed with all of them being much closer to the world of comedy, speaks volumes for what was created. Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson were just perfect. I believed every word, they added much needed weight and they were key in creating the overall tone of the movie. Of course, the main shock (and I'm sure it was for most) was in young actress Jennifer Carpenter. Her portrayal of the title character was genuinely other-worldly. For a young actress to go from a small part in a comedy such as 'White Chicks' a year prior to this performance is just incredible. This whole project worked because of the care and professionalism each member put into it and for me that is tangible at every moment throughout the picture.VERDICT: A friend asked me recently when discussing horror movies, ""what was the last movie you watched that made you keep the light on?"" I had to think for a while. It had been a while. There have been movies that have made me uneasy, scenes that have scared me, shots that have startled. But in truth the last time I remember actually going to bed, keeping that little light on because of what I had witnessed was The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. The movie just speaks for itself really and seems to hit home regardless if you believe in the subject matter or not. As an horror fan, it is my go-to if I need a stark reminder of how things can be done effectively in the newer aspects of the genre and this one never loses its sting. 10 years later and I'm still rushing for those lights...",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
321,mike-3322,Hmmm.....,5,21 March 2006,"As someone who has a great deal of interest in, and derives a great deal of enjoyment from, the horror film genre, it gives me absolutely no pleasure at all to say that The Exorcism of Emily Rose, while not a bad film by any means, was something of a disappointment to me, having just finished watching it on DVD.Why? The advertising for the film is the biggest culprit for me. I felt this was rather misleading throughout, suggesting that the film is something it isn't, and it's a poor state of affairs when the online advert for a horror film (in this instance, the one with the fridge magnet 'game' on it) gives you more of a fright than the film itself ever manages.To be fair to the film, it has a novel storyline, and some of the demonic vision sequences near the beginning of the film, while possibly just a little influenced by The Ring, do make your skin crawl.The court-room scenes, however, jarred for me, the dialogue was often banal (for instance, demonic possession is suddenly introduced to the jury as a possible cause of Emily's death without a trace of self consciousness or irony) and some of the characters (the counsel for the prosecution in particular) either stereotypical or plain irritating. What's worse, though, is that the film seems to make a habit of failing to follow up tense build-up scenes with any real kicker (the 3am scenes in the counsel for the defence's apartment are the worst culprits in this respect), and that's frustrating to say the least.Comparisons with The Exorcist and, to an extent, Exorcist: The Beginning, are inevitable, and while the three films purport to steer in different directions, the new film can't help but live in the shadow of the 1970s classic original for my money.Maybe I'm expecting too much from modern-day horror films, but I'm still waiting for something to top the heart-stopping feeling films like the original Ju On: The Grudge, the US re-make of The Ring, the original Halloween and the original The Shining have inspired in me over the years.Sadly, this film, while good in parts, just isn't it.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

About 30 minutes in we were ready to turn it off, but we finished it. I remember looking at the clock at least 30 times wondering when it would ever end. Neither of us had ever been so bored with a movie in our entire lives. I would go as far to say this is in my top 20 worst movies of all time.

Besides, I think the jury did not understood the ""reasonable doubt"" standard in criminal cases. If the jury thought Father Moore was guilty...why they recommended a ""short sentence""?

327,cameron-wilsonx,"Horrible Fabrication/Misrepresentation of ""Based on a true story""",1,14 November 2011,"The movie claims to be based on a true story. It is as far as it's about a girl who was decidedly possessed (by her priest) who ended up dying and the courts ultimately found the priest guilty. Aside from that and a few other minor details in common, the story was a complete fabrication and distortion of the real case.As an example, in the real case, both parents and there were two priests who were charged and found guilty. There was no doctor involved there were no mysterious murders surrounding the case. There was not some hot agnostic prosecutor who apparently finds spirituality borne through her fear of events that didn't happen. The priests didn't get off and didn't go into hiding. Emily Rose doesn't have grave site that people mass towards for spiritual guidance.This movie was more about perpetuating the fears that are borne of religion and in a very untruthful and shady way, attempts to reinforce the ""scary"" aspects about religion in order to gain converts. The funny thing about these ""true"" exorcism movies are, it only seems to happen to the very devout. Here's a lesson for you: if you don't want to be possessed, don't be religious! It's miraculous! Aside from all of the religious punditry, the movie was OK. There were a few points in the movie that were pretty awful. During one of the scenes with the Defense Attorney is interviewing the priest, she asks him to testify as to why God didn't do anything for Emily. Now this might not strike many as incorrect but you typically can't testify about why someone else did something because you're not him/her and you don't know. And, the ""person"" the question was being asked about was God. As far as I know, the only Western religion who even claims to have the authority of being able to speak with God and provide mandates from God is the Catholic church but that's exclusively through the Pope. So asking some random priest to testify as to why God didn't do anything for Emily during her supposed exorcism is even more ludicrous! ...terrible movie.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
328,Wintersnake,"Finally, a grown up, modern horror drama movie about Exorcism.",10,12 December 2005,"Still ruling on the throne as the best Exorcism movie ever, The Exorcist has now finally gotten a rival that will be remembered for a long time. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a haunting movie that shakes the very foundations of our beliefs, and forces us to ask the very same questions that the jury in the movie is faced with.Based on a true story, The Exorcism of Emily Rose takes place in modern time, when a girl has died after being subjected to Exorcism by Father Moore. Moore is put on trial, charged with neglecting Emily's medical need, forcing his view that Exorcism was the only way to cure her. The lawyer Erin Bruner gets on the case to defend the Priest, and along the way she'll start to face her own demons, question her faith and fight for something she's not sure about.The star of the show is Emily Rose. As her normal self, she's a sweet girl, but just like Regan in The Exorcist, she masters the sides of good and evil as she turns over to the dark side once the possessions begin. Her face distorts, her body twists into unbelievable positions, she becomes incredibly violent and dangerous. While her looks are never as gruesome as Regan in The Exorcist, they're much more real, which serves the movie well. The movie presents us with situations, unexplainable, yet backed up with enough visual proof to convince us that what were seeing, was an actual possession, while it then proceeds to question our decision with lots of reasons and explanations for why it's impossible, and backs it up with scientific explanations to confirm this. Yet, it leaves both camps open, although it slightly tilts over into the ""Possessed"" side. Not so much that it becomes biased towards one side, but probably in order to create reasonable arguments that she was possessed, since arguably, the medical and scientific side is very powerful and believable in the movie. If the visual signs of her possessions hadn't been so dominant in the movie, it would have been much harder to create the wanted effect on the audience. Yet for all her behavior and changes, she still remains human, her voice, eyes, body movement and so on are still explained in a scientific way, making it possible to say ""She was not possessed"" based on the movie. Personally, I like to think that she was possessed, but the movie does such a great job of making both sides convincing that I'd accept both possibilities.Much of the movie doesn't actually take place with Emily, rather it deals with the events in and out of the courtroom, in the trial. Some of these scenes drags a little bit, but not so much so they become boring. They still focus on Emily, the Pros and Cons of her treatment, the beliefs and denial of her possession and so on, keeping even these scenes interesting, and quite vital to the things that occur in Emily's scenes. They are also never used for cheap scares, the movie is far above such silly attempts to scare. It mostly keeps the scares in the scenes with Emily, making the courtroom scenes almost a relief at times, since it allows the viewer to reflect on the scenes that happened, and make up his own decisions based on the arguments and evidence further displayed in the courtroom. So, if viewed properly, the movie never really looses the grip, it just switches hands between scaring us, and giving us explanations of what happened.A visually powerful movie, both in terms of Emily's tortured state of believed possession, and the overall photography, usage of color and closeups, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is not for the faint of heart. There's no gore or blood to speak of at all, and apart from a few visual effects as Emily's world of sanity is falling apart, there's very little CGI to detract from the feeling of reality. Yet, Emily does all the work, her body and face alone. Some of her expressions are so weird in a creepy and wicked way, that when considering she did most of all by her self, makes the whole thing downright nasty.Yes, the movie is still fiction at heart, but it manages to paint a very chilling and real picture of an actual possession. There's no 360 degree head spinning, pea soup puking or heavy levitation here(Don't get me wrong, it worked in The Exorcist). Only a girl suffering from symptoms that can be either explained with science, or with the Supernatural, and not once does it try to state which of the sides are true, leaving it fully up to the viewer to decide. And even if she wasn't possessed, any illness that would cause her condition are so scary that they leaves us feeling helpless and scared in the end, no matter our personal belief. Easily the most grown up, modern Horror movie for years, that rivals The Exorcist. Where The Exorcist reigns supreme with visual power and sheer terror, The Exorcism of Emily Rose grabs us psychologically, and leaves us trembling with questions about our own lifelong beliefs about good and evil and if something like that could happen to us.This is a movie that should be seen by all who watched The Exorcist, all horror fans, and even those who thinks that possessions, demons and exorcisms are just bogus. You can convince yourself that there's nothing supernatural about what she went through, the horror that still killed Emily Rose are so gruesome that it takes us all with her and changes us.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

First of all, I fell asleep after the first hour then I began to slowly wake up to see if the movie got motivating and entertaining. It wasn't remotely frightening, it was slow going, the transitions of flashbacks and the whole trial was irritating and they we're very keen on special effects or sudden alarming music like they have in a lot of horror/suspense movies. I never startled once, even at the beginning where she freaks out during class or when she was sleeping in her dorm room. To be honest, I figured they wouldn't have a lot of court scenes and that the film would go in depth and see ""WHAT SERIOUSLY HAPPENED TO EMILY ROSE?"" from the very beginning to the climatic end. What was up with the ending? Tom Wilkinson is found guilty and somehow walks Scott free. That didn't make a lick of sense!! What happened there, guys?

Other than that, the film was quite good, not great, but not corny either. I also felt that the characters stories involved in the prosecution and defense of the priest who performed the exorcism on Emily Rose were poorly written and were void of any depth. Although Laura Linney gave a great performance. Even a brief appearance by a secret eyewitness which I thought would have lead to something exciting, was over just as fast as it began. I was hoping for more focus and background on Emily Rose herself. The movie still wasn't half-bad, I recommend renting it when out on DVD, but if you're a fan of being scared out of your seat, watch the movie in the theatre for the effects.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
333,belikekj,Not without flaws,7,28 January 2012,"For the most part, films which were intended to frighten the viewing audience usually succeed in instead producing involuntary laughs. So it was nice to see a 'horror' film that not only has a brain for a change, but actually succeeds in being frightening. It may help that the film is allegedly based on true events, which gives credibility to the storyline, and prevents the movie from having those annoyingly gaping plot holes. And indeed, the heading ""Based on a true story"" doesn't come off as a glaring lie. There are indeed events happening in the film which are questionable as to whether they actually occurred in real life, but the beauty of 'Emily Rose' is that most of the film is retold by various characters, so the events described are as the character perceived them. In this way, the film doesn't distance its audience by declaring that ""well, demons were in the film which was 'based on a true story', so demons must actually exist"".But in many ways, 'Emily Rose' is different from almost every past horror movie in the sense that it doesn't make really obvious attempts to frighten its audience. Instead, director/co-screenwriter Scott Derickson seems content to make us think. There are several questions raised in the film regarding religious beliefs and the public's general perception of them, but these are all handled in an objective and impartial manner. And as for the scare factor, since the filmmakers aren't overly obvious in trying to scare the audience, the film actually is frightening at several points - again, unusual for a horror film. The frightening events regarding Emily Rose's exorcism are all the more frightening as they don't seem horribly staged and predictable. (although the cheesy demonic animation, as shown in the trailer, could have been done far better) It's true that composer Christopher Young seems unable to resist the horror movie cliché of having horribly over-dramatic music which builds to a climax at the most frightening moment, but for the most part the movie is able to surpass the usual horror clichés.It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. My only complaint is that the characters of Campbell Scott and Colm Feore were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless.So The Exorcism of Emily Rose may not quite be the very best of its genre, but it certainly proves to be one of the more intelligently made ones. The director seems to have for once taken that extra step, and put aside the endless thrills and shocks in favor of making us think a bit. There are some cheesy effects, such as the demonic visions, but there are some genuinely frightening parts, especially the actual exorcism scene, mainly due to the chilling and captivating performance from Jennifer Carpenter as the title character. The principle cast members, Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also give strong performances, bringing many layers to their characters. Quite the quality piece overall, and one worth seeing.-8/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
334,jamesfnomar,Great movie- acting and dialog needs work- scary as hell!,8,15 September 2005,"I saw this movie last night with about 3 other people in the entire theater. I left the theater feeling satisfied- after all- I just watched one of the most terrifying experiences of a human being on film.First off, comparison to the Exorcist. And yes I am comparing because it IS an exorcism movie (as well as a courtroom drama). The actual possession and exorcism scenes were done more affectively than The Exorcist. I think the whole aura surrounding the scariness of The Exorcist was it is an original and very profane and graphic for its time. The cinematography during her 'episodes' was magnificent. The actress who played Emily Rose deserves an award for her insane portrayal of a woman possessed by demons and the devil. There were many affective scares throughout the movie. Her contortions were uber creepy and the noises she belted out were spine tingling.Some complaints, the acting from the priest and the prosecution lawyer were sub-par. Tom Wilkinson's dialog was too forced and tried to sound menacing and not natural. He never came across as a priest- may have been a wrong casting for this role. The lawyer was just horrible- you notice his acting with every line.I thought there were plenty of Emily Rose scenes and all were extremely creepy. You feel for her as the demons take over her body and soul. This is an excellent movie. I recommend to any film lover, especially scary movie lovers such as myself.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Her facial expressions and bizarre postures give the movie several very creepy moments.I also really liked the priest who, despite being ridiculed by lawyers and psychiatrists, just kept on doing what he could for this poor tortured girl. The priest was admirable.I liked the ending too. It was noble and uplifting despite the obvious sadness.PS I don't know if Annelise Michel was really possessed or not.

Having them and witnessing them are two different things.I never realized just HOW FRIGHTENING they appeared to others. And now I do. The spasms. The contortions. Unable to control your body. I understand that (except for the demonic possession- NO THANK YOU!!!) all too well.I am still unsettled but very impressed that this film chose to unfold Emily's story from flashbacks from eyewitnesses (priest, parents, sister, doctor & boyfriend) and not Hollywoodized it.I really feel for Emily.

I knew that everything they did in this movie they wanted to be totally original and different from any other exorcism movies. Knowing that it was based on a true story was a good way to peak my interest. After watching the movie, I must say I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. This is a slow, boring movie all about a trial. It's a lot more like Primal Fear or Murder in the First than it is The Exorcist, only not as good as either of them. There's very little footage of the actual possession/exorcism, and what they do show isn't really very original or well shot either, and did I mention that it's not scary either. And the supernatural stuff that was going on around the trial just reeked of the low quality stuff that filled movies like the Grudge. It was just a sad way to make the movie ""scary."" I'll take atmosphere over bumps and boos any day, and unfortunately this movie lacked it. If you want to see a good movie or even just a scary movie, pass on this one.

338,amitkurup,"Intense, Gripping and definitely not PG-13",8,20 May 2015,"As far as the genre of horror goes, I wont like to put it into that domain. this is more of a psychological thriller woven quite nicely into a movie. it does stay true to the fact that it will manage to scare the crap out of you but still I am not inclined to put this in horror.The exorcism of Emily rose is inspired by true events which makes it both shocking and disturbing. When you know that it is quite possible that this has happened to someone it disturbs you no end although you don't even know Emily rose.This movie is about exorcism as is evident in the title itself. How Emily reacts to the exorcism is the crux of this story. the main two characters of this movie Emily ( Jennifer carpenter ) and Father moore ( Tom Wilkinson ) carry this movie on their shoulders all the way. The movie talks about a exorcism gone wrong in which a girl, Emily rose dies. the priest involved, Tom Wilkinson is given a good lawyer to defend himself, played quite aptly by Laura Linny. Most part of the movie is played out in courtroom and the scenes look quite genuine.You will never imagine that Jennifer carpenter is not the actual emilly who went through the ordeal. she is perfect and it is a travesty if she has not got any awards for this. Tom Wilkinson is in his usual elements and doesn't over act although there is a lot of scope to over act some of his scenes. He is very assured even when he is saying something about GODs and Demons which you yourself would not ever believe. His belief in his own work makes this movie the movie it is.See it with your eyes open and you will be pleasantly surprised by the end of it. Of course after the movie, sleeping in the night is no guarantee.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

I do not discredit their dogma. Who knows, I may be wrong.If I had to go to trial over a possession case, and both sides argued as wonderfully convincingly as they did in this film, I can say that we would probably be deadlocked for a while. Usually, it seems that many films are one sided. You are supposed to feel one way about the characters. However, in the court scenes, and after the ending statements, I must say that I was indecisive.As for the rest of the film, it may be a little over-dramatized, but it did have it's jumpy moments.

340,joelduplessis,"It's not a horror, it's a drama. And it's a great one.",9,17 September 2005,"Those who were disappointed by this movie were those who went expecting a horror or a supernatural thriller. While it is deeply disturbing and occasionally frightening, The Exorcism of Emily rose is not The Exocist, nor does it try to be. Rather, it is a thought- provoking legal drama that challenges the viewer's presuppositions about the relative authority of spiritual versus physiological explanations for human experience. As the court case surrounding Emily's fatal exorcism unfolds, the jurors -- and by extension, the movie- goers -- are faced with a conundrum, expressed by Roger Ebert as follows: ""A juror who does not believe in demons must find the priest guilty, if perhaps sincere. A juror who does believe in demons must decide if Emily Rose was really possessed, or misdiagnosed. In a case like this, during the jury selection, are you qualified or disqualified by believing one way or the other?"" In other words, is a secular prejudice any more (or less) valid than a spiritual one? The Exorcism of Emily Rose leaves this question unanswered, just as did the real case of Anneliese Michel on which the film is based.Horror film buffs tend to like their monsters outlandish and their plots twisted, so that their entertainment never threatens the normalacy of their real life. This movie challenges that neat separation by offering a plot that is more human than twisted, and a monster that exists and operates in the everyday world of hundreds of millions of everyday human beings. An overworked musical score and unsatisfying character development of Emily does not detract from the effect. In the end, The Exorcism of Emily Rose is well worth watching for anyone who is prepared to think and be challenged, if not disturbed.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

342,DCompton86,Quite Interesting (possible spoilers),8,9 January 2006,I found the movie to be quite interesting. The actors and actresses all did exceptionally well and made their characters very believable. The court room drama seemed very real on how everyone would act - and the possible possession scenes weren't as stereotypical as it is shown in most movies. I give a little bad credit to the writers for not researching the case that the movie is based off of (a German girl named Anneliese Michel who was reported to have epilepsy and hallucinations) very well. The movie seemed a little biased to epilepsy and epileptics and I doubt a whole lot of research was done based on acting - which offended me since I am epileptic - but overall it is a film definitely worth being seen.,The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Somehow, I missed the part where it said ""based upon a true story"" and I'm glad I did. The courtroom drama is believable and not the sort of contrived clap-trap I've come to expect. The supernatural segments are tastefully done and reserved. Even-handed is a phrase that comes to mind. Particularly entertaining were all the players who come from other movies and TV shows that never quite reach BIG NAME status and thus are a refreshing cast who perform ably and create the verisimilitude that makes this a great film. This is a film well worth watching ~ yes, it did give me chills and I did look askance at the shadows in the room ~ and I highly recommend it.

Mixing a court drama with an exorcism is I think one of the most brilliant and original ideas I have ever seen. And I think the movie develops it well. Set aside for what I think are wonderful performances by the main character, especially Laura Linney (remember her as a lawyer in ""Primal fear""?), the structure of the story is almost perfect. Yes, there are ""bugs"" in the story (know any movie that doesn't?), but overall it's scary, compelling and innovative. I loved this movie, especially in a panorama of high school horrors I'm fed up with, and it's a powerful re-reading of the exorcism theme that not even the Exorcist sequel was able to accomplish. I wish there were more ideas like this, mixing different genres and creating something that is not necessarily aimed at easy scares. Kudos!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
345,telescopium,Worth the money.,9,20 September 2005,"Very well written movie. It was suspenseful. The music played along with that wonderful and wasn't over done. The effects were good, with out being cheesy. The plot was unique, and although exorcism has been in the movies before, this one was very well done. Much better then any I had previously seen. The movie left you with a creepy chilled effect. Perfect for upcoming Halloween I might add. The part I like best was how they used small details, such as the time, and how they explained it. Very well done movie.This movie has a R rating and is not good for children, but it isn't offensive. It has a lot of frightening images, and would really scare any kids under 15 or 16. The religious content is non-offensive in the way that it was done, and I really liked that. Some movies that deal in the subject of religion can be a hard subject to approach.

I found the language that Emily speaks when she is in a haunted state fascinating. In the scene's in which she undergoes those attacks the acting is amazing! The actress playing Emily Rose does a very good job.

The link below takes you to an article of the original Russian story:http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=2337672005 This version is based in America, surprise! and modern day. Where as the Exorcist all took place in a little 'ol house, this follows Emily from home to Uni and back home again where she is taken to be looked after, and where the Exorcism kills her. The story is mainly based around the court case where the Priest is in defence of killing her and that her death was caused by accident from the strains of constant excorsims. The other side of the case is, the priest killed her because he requested she come off the drugs for the diagnosed psychotic epilepsy.A really good movie, it can be slow paced at times i.e. the court parts but that doesn't matter as it's good stuff, and the chiller parts make up for slow parts for people who would get bored.All the demonic parts happen at 3am (the devils witching hour, i.e. the opposite time that Jesus was said to have died, that being 3pm) I finished watching at 1.30am then went to bed...spookily enough I then woke up at 3am on the dot!! nice! nowt happened like!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Unfortuitously humans, whatever they ""believe,"" be it ""science"" or ""religion"" or neither or both, are at times found capable of error. What? No one ever died under psychiatric care? Whether we believe in heart transplants might depend. Is anyone pointing a knife at our heart? Perhaps it isn't the ""religion"" or the ""science"" so much as it is the knowledge, wisdom, experience and skill of the person using it. Ethan Thomas, the prosecutor, seemed to possess no wisdom or experience, nothing but an obstinate and unfounded belief in ""science."" The priest, on the other hand, had a medical doctor present to help. According to everything I have read and seen about exorcism they always do by their own requirement. The finding of the jury was absolutely based on the closed-minded superstition, and ""superstition"" is the correct word, that the medical testimony of the prosecutor's doctor was infallible. That doesn't make any sense. Perhaps no one is comfortable believing in the possibility of possession, even the religious. And no one is comfortable believing in schizophrenia or multiple personality disorders, even scientists. This movie might be comforting in that it denies those possibilities, tries to ignore them.

350,Satria,"Obscene, exploitative propaganda piece",1,10 November 2005,"First of all ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is not a well crafted film. The hollow plot devices and dialogues are laughably stale, cinematography and editing are lacking any style and the scares simply fall flat. A cast of usually brilliant performers delivers uninspired, phone-in performances. Of course, I could dismiss this flick as a dumb, misguided, scare-free piece of drivel. Unfortunately, it's much worse than that.Like most pictures dealing with the subject, this film actually treats demonic possession as real and thus depicts the practice of exorcism not only as viable but as a necessary tool against the forces of evil. This generally makes exorcism pictures propaganda material for a rather medieval method still covered by today's catholic doctrine. Now, it's not that I generally oppose the catholic faith, but this particular practice is despicable. While most pictures of this horror sub-genre go more for simple scares than philosophical discussion, this film takes a stance for exorcism by putting the conflict in a court room.The filmmakers make a big deal out of the fact that the film is based on a true story, suggesting that the case of ""Emily Rose"" substantiates the existence of demonic possession and that all the people involved were in fact not unscrupulous religious fanatics, but upright men of faith. If you are familiar with the true case, which took place in Germany in the late 1970s, this depiction will strike you as disgusting and cynical spin doctoring. An obscene, exploitative propaganda piece void of any integrity or empathy for authentic human suffering. Anneliese Michel (the ""real"" Emily) and her grueling fate are not treated with the proper respect.In short, Michel was a deeply religious, though psychologically disturbed young woman, who was basically tortured to death by a her parents and some priest, because everyone involved agreed that her epileptic convulsions and tourette-like rantings were clear signs of demonic possessions. Severely beaten up, with her front teeth knocked out(all supposedly by the demon inside her) she died of starvation after days of exorcism. The practice of exorcism had been made fairly popular in catholic circles through the smash hit success of Willam Friedkin's The Exorcist a few years earlier, so it was a small leap of faith for Michel, her family and that priest to believe exorcism was a viable option. After Michel's death copies of an audio taping of her exorcism became a very popular device to promote the catholic cause in church groups - basically making Michel a poster child for exorcism. Two years after Michel's death, her parents and her exorcist were convicted, but came off with ridiculously short jail sentences.Treated with the proper respect and integrity and with some actual brains behind the project this film could have made some powerful statements about fanaticism and homicidal tendencies, if it only had stayed true to it's source material. The true story of Anneliese Michel is a haunting testament to the cruelty of men. It could make for a very intense, grueling drama. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is quite the opposite. It's an unwilling farce, exploiting the sad, cruel fate of Michel, using cheap shock effects and cheesy story-lining.It is beyond me why such brilliant actors as Laura Linney, Campbell Scott (two of my absolute favorite actors) and Tom Wilkinson would have participated in this horribly, ill-conceived borefest. After all, they have been known to usually star in intelligent, independent-minded films. This is just a clumsy exploitation flick pandering to the religious right (who made this cheap movie a box office-success). It saddens me to think they did it for the money, but it saddens me even more to think that they actually believed this film to be a project of integrity.The torture of psychologically disturbed Anneliese is turned into the saintly martyrdom of Emily, who decides upon meeting Mother Mary halfway into the exorcism, that she would rather have some more fatal demonic torture than being let into heaven right away - because that is the true way of showing Satan and his pals who's boss (beats me how that works). All of this is being told through some corny letter from Emily that the exorcist reads out aloud while in the witness stand. The jury then decides, that even though he is clearly guilty, he should not be put in prison, because he's not a homicidal fanatic, but rather a nice old man who stands by his faith. The judge agrees and let's good old Tom Wilkinson go. Of course, by this time (close to the end credits) the film has already established that the priest actually is right - since we can see the demon doing all sorts of shenanigans: harassing Laura Linney's lawyer lady and stopping her watch at 3am (the demonic witching hour, we learn - by the way, the only demonic thing going on at that time around where I live is Larry King interviewing Dr.Phil and other phonies), yanking poor Emily around, widening her pupils to give her what can only be described as Demonovision, making her play piano and letting her speak Aramaic, Latin and of course, the ever evil German (so the demon is musical and multilingual - neat, eh?). To make the whole thing a fair and balanced experience for the audience, Campbell Scott's disgruntled prosecutor gets to show his cynical debunked view of events, but it's clearly established through light switches moving by themselves, some kooky doctor witness mysteriously getting run over by a car, a lame version of aforementioned audio tape (the true recording is terrifying, by the way) and some silly locket with the defender's initials, that there are definitely divine and hellish forces battling it out here.So in the end this film cheesily gives a thumbs up to exorcism, while using the horrific true story of a victim of that very practice as a basis. It's sickening.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The case is very interesting for psychologists.Here I try a summery of the German sites: Anneliese was strictly catholic educated by its grandparents and parents. So strictly that the families held the virgin of Fatima in honors on each 13. of the month.If she became older she had the same wishes as every young girl. But she could not permit the desires, because they were sin. Therefore she fled itself in conference areas. But than happened that she could not hold no more under control the conference areas. In these conference areas she spoke out that what she want and what she hate. So she spoke out for example that ""each 13. monthly is her shitday"". Attention, she said ""her"" not ""my"". When she was out of control she always talk about herself in the third form not in the 1st form. She could wish or criticize only as ""Demon"" something. She never criticize something as ""Anneliese"" because she had fear to come into hell. The film conceals that it gave over 50 exorcism meetings. It conceals also that the ""Demons"" reclaimed lost stricter catholic rules in churches. For example that the communion wafers to be put into the mouth and not take themselves by the members of the church.The mother Maria ""appeared"" her also, when she concerned the question whether it may put on trousers or not.

I hated this movie and so did everyone else in the theater. I was biting my fingers to avoid laughing the whole time. Avoid at all costs! 2/10",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The performances were outstanding, The suspense was outstanding, One of the few movies that my sit on the edge of my seat. I would NOT recommend this movie for people with heart disease or any of that sort.This movie is THE most frightening movie of the century. What makes it even more scarier is that it's True. The voices that are used in the movie are true. and it just makes you swallow hard and want to pee in your pants. I really was very excited to see this movie and I admit I was really scared and excited at the same time. A True Classic, Linney Does a Great Job .. One more thing ..

Those movies may have been scary in their time, but in 2005, ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is far scarier and more disturbing. There will be no heads turning in 360 degrees or pea soup on walls, but the character of Rose will convince you that the devil does exist.The Performances by Laura Linney as the defense attorney and Tom Wilkenson as the Priest compelled to tell Rose's story are reasons alone to spend your money on this film. I was also impressed with Cambell Scott as the professed Christian prosecutor. A huge step up from Dying Young.In any event, the movie is absolutely a must see, but be warned that the subject matter will linger...it's very disturbing.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
358,Envy2071,The Exorcist meets Law & Order,7,10 September 2005,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is a courtroom drama/horror movie that was probably conceived with the notion of attracting viewers of both the Sci-Fi Channel and the ever-growing fanbase of crime/courtroom dramas fueled by CourtTV and TNT. The fact that it is a peculiar combination only succeeds in making it all the more riveting. For a movie based on the topic of exorcism, a genre torn apart by dozens of ""Exorcist"" rip-offs and parodies, TEOER somehow manages to maintain believability. It is supposedly based on a true story, and for once it seems that the filmmakers did not exploit it into an excuse to show explicit violence and buckets of blood and gore. Granted there are demons, and they make up for the majority of the movie's frightening moments. These demons , however, are only seen by Emily, and one never sees them physically attack her or anyone else. From the way Emily writhes and contorts her body, however, it is plain to be seen that the damage is being done on the inside. The acting is fine throughout, though it is a pity that Colm Feore was not given more screen time with his great acting skills. Most people still see him as Andre LiNoge from ""Storm of the Century."" All in all there is not much in the way scary stuff. The demons are kind of freaky, but the film usually relies on the fear of the unseen to strike fear into its audience. The movie makes the viewer wonder, more than anything else, and think about the probability and the truth to such things as demonic possession and exorcism. It's not a bad way to spent a couple hours, especially in comparison to the other stuff Hollywood's been shoveling out lately.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The element that added to the fright this movie produced is probably the line ""Based on a true story"". The fact that a few people have gone through that, either being psychotic or possessed, is simply frightening. This movie pulls on every string that may scare you; the few jump parts, the visuals, and just the pure fear it instills in your mind.

I wounder around what year this all took place? Scott Derrickson did a fanominal job directing this movie, Jennifer Carpenter did an amazing job as Emily Rose and I don't think that anyone else could have done any better. Tim Wilkinson did a great job as Father Moore also, he made the plot so much more entertaining as did Laura Linney who played as Erin Bruner.

That's not to say that this particular case is or is not real... but overall. Even with this in mind, the movie still provides some good spooky and scary moments, but it's certainly not ""over the top"" with this.

But after about 2 hours of a mix of boring courtroom testimonies and uninspired possession scenes, I was left totally unmoved by the film. The storyline is quite simple, bovine-faced young woman is possessed by many demons. After her death, the priest,who tried to expel the demons from our protagonist, is tried in court for negligence. Also in the story, is a lawyer battling her own inner demons and questioning her faith (or lack thereof). I think this movie would've been much more interesting if they hadn't centered the actual story of the exorcism around this trial. I think, if you're looking for a good exorcism movie, save yourself 3 dollars and rent the original Exorcist movie.

What happened to Emily Rose is still under question but no matter what happened it was a terrible thing to happen to any human being. I firmly believe in a spiritual realm so I believe that Emily Rose was possessed and that many of the prosecute arguments were lame and full of loop holes that should have been pointed out. Further more I would have held him in contempt of court because he was often times rude and ill mannered.Although not what some people would think of as a horror flick, really what's more frightening then Satan?

I love scary movies, but this type of stuff just flat out frightens me! I saw it the day it came out and to be honest with you, I was rather happy with the way the movie was thought out, produced and the way the actors ... acted. I went in expecting to be scared to death. I came out knowing more about exorcisms.This movie isn't a typical 'scary movie'. This movie is more like a documentary in a movie style format. There's a lot of courtroom drama. It has a few parts that made me scream in the movie theater and parts that make you sit there, astonished, and wonder if maybe this could actually happen, if so how often and to whom? It focuses on the events according to the priest that was handling the exorcism and the attorney that tried the case.I think that if you see this movie and are expecting a movie to make you scream, jump or be 'halloweenish' horrified - this isn't the one for you. If you're looking for a movie that has a tape from the exorcism played, a true story that's in 'documentary style' format and takes place mainly in the courtroom - this is the one for you. Like I said, there are parts that made me jump, made me scream, made me wonder and almost made me cry. I hope this helped!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

No great education is  required to have an understanding or opinion. A great movie provides  satisfaction to the audience. Period. This is the most abysmal failure  at a drama I can recall. I saw much better courtroom drama on ""The  Practice"". ""A Miracle on 34th Street"" beats this movie all to hell for  courtroom drama. As a horror this movie also fails miserably. Nothing  horrible happens other than the death of the protagonist and the  audience never sees it. Don't dare compare this movie to ""The Grudge"",  which was only a decent movie, but vastly superior in both suspense and  thrills to this stinker. Contrary to other viewers I saw no great  performances delivered (unless you think screaming is a great  performance) and no performance could have saved this film's writing.  No relationships are established between the protagonist and any other  character (even the antagonist) The entire movie relies on the weakest  backstory delivery of flashback, and the protagonist's major challenge  is not set up to overcome, but rather lasts the length of the film, and  no satisfying resolution is ever achieved (whether you think the  protagonist is Emily Rose or Father Moore). Even the weak courtroom  drama is resolved in unsatisfying half measures. Bottom line avoid at  theater prices - and only watch if someone else pays to rent.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It's funny how so many people are upset over this religious movie as if Hollywood keeps spining out religious films! If there is anything of value about 'Emily' is that there are not enough films about God. Because if you believe in God, you must believe in the evil one - Satan. Totally believe that someone can be possessed like Emily, but it didn't go far enough in showing 'why' she was possessed. A much better film about the last days is a movie called 'Gone' that was in Blockbuster last year - it was suppose to be one of the best rentals at the chain.

Although this was based on a true story I'm certain that there were portions that were either put in or taken out for the purposes of good Hollywood storytelling. However, the story was told so well and the possession scenes were so horrific that I felt chills go up my spine. The only drawback I found was at the very end when the jury recommended a sentence of time served. I work for the legal system and I know that for a jury to recommend a sentence in place of the judge's sentence is completely bogus and never happened in the real story. Despite this, I found every aspect of the film to be genius and one of the most horrific stories (next to The Exorcist). Definitely, one of my favorites of the year!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
371,justin-sleeper,Much better than expected,8,9 February 2006,"After reading reviews for this movie, my expectations went from sensational to barely any. The movie itself proved to be much better than expected. It is not ""The Exorcist"" nor is it a slow-moving court drama. It is a well done combination of the two.The movie dares viewers to take a position as to what truly happened to Emily Rose. The viewers make the same journey as the characters in the movie, especially Emily Rose and Erin Bruner. Both positions of medical or supernatural causality are presented and convincing, though the movie was clearly bias towards the supernatural.I found the lawyers' characters interesting in their preconceived beliefs and their consequent reactions to the trial. Laura Linney was excellent as her role as the defending lawyer, and you can clearly see the character's change in beliefs and values.The exorcism in the movie is not nearly as detailed, grotesque, or lengthy as the one in ""The Exorcist,"" but it was intense and disturbing.This movie is definitely worth watching.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
372,bfauvelle,Makes you think!,8,26 February 2006,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is part courtroom drama and part horror movie. The movie takes place as Emily Rose's death is announced and a Catholic priest is charged with contributing to her death. An upstart lawyer takes the case in the hopes of furthering her career and ends up being drawn into the mysterious circumstances that lead to Emily Rose's possession and subsequent death. The movie moves back and forth between courtroom scenes and flashbacks that help tell Emily's story. It is advertised as a true story, but is actually loosely based on the possession of a German girl named Anneliese Michel.Before watching this movie, I was skeptical of how effective the movie would be considering that it was rated PG-13. I have a certain bias against movies rated PG-13 when their title suggests that it should be R-rated. I was not overly disappointed with the possession and excorcism scenes. The most noticeable part of the movie that seemed to be cleaned up was the lines of the possessed Emily Rose. I would expect that a demon would use course language and obscene material to insult the priest and other characters. The demons instead challenged the priest using stern, but clean, language.Being interested in the scary things that religion has to offer, I enjoyed the various tidbits of information regarding demonic possession, such as the 3:00am demonic activity hour. I thought that this movie effectively stirred emotions and left me thinking about God and evil both during the movie and after the movie. For the non-religious movie-goer, I can see how this movie can be perceived as ""preaching to the non-believers"". Regardless, if you like to be religiously challenged, I think you would enjoy this movie.I thought that the actor performances ranged from very good (Tom Wilkinson) to adequate (Laura Linney). The young actress who played Emily Rose did a nice job in developing the innocent aspect of her character.Personally, I think that if the movie was strictly based on the Anneliese Michel excorcism and not an Americanized Hollywood version, it could have been much scarier. I would have even gone as far as using a German speaking script and having English subtitles. Knowing that the events in the movie were actual fact would have made the effect that much scarier.Overall, I think this movie was very good. It is not fair to compare to such a legendary movie as The Excorcist, but in comparison to the lame horror movies released in recent years, this is one of the best.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

I counted at least 12 spine-tingling moments in the film, which considering half the film took place in a dry, engaging courtroom setting, means that there was a big scare every 5 or 6 minutes when not in court! Not the typical junk that passes for horror fare these days, the movie tries (and succeeds, in my opinion) to keep the viewer engaged from the beginning. You have to pay attention, as it a smarter movie than most Horror movies these days. The characters are all believable, as is the story line, and lo and behold, so is the scares. Most horror movies try to scare with lots of blood and gore, these days, but Emily Rose scares you by creating an atmosphere. Whether its based on a true story, or not, it seemed to hold my attention throughout. There is no reason to spoil the movie by rehashing it, so I will just highly recommend it to anyone and everyone that wants to have the hell scared out of them!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

A lesson on how to make a film using 5 set locations.,1,25 March 2006,"When i was first watching this film, there seemed to be some kind of promise in it.. the poster looked alright, so i thought - why not ? I won't be disappointed! HOW WRONG I WAS.Firstly, there are the main sets used in this film, which are switched between faster than you can imagine;1. The courtroom 2. Her house 3. The street outside the courtroom 4. The barn near Emily's house 5. Emily's house + surroundings.Now, firstly, the film was very bad on all levels because there was so much sucking up to the church that if an alien watched this film, it would believe that every single word of the bible is complete truth and is irrevocably 100% proved. The idea throughout the film was ""she had faith"", and this is portrayed in so many ways that by the time you're 30 minutes into the film, you realise how many times that sentence can be re-phrased.Now, another thing which, was to the amusement of several people around me was my guessing when a ""flashback"" would occur - it seemed that no sooner had the lawyer opened her mouth that we were presented with another flashback occurred, and i was surprised that when she talked about the bible, there wasn't a flashback to a man sat there, reading it out verbatim.If you're bored by seeing how many times a film can include Christian terminology and try and pass it off as absolute fact, a.k.a ""a true story"" as well as to bring up seemingly magnificent pseudoscience to illustrate a very long, drawn out point, then i suggest you walk into your video store and laugh if you see this title.Very well filmed, extremely poor acting, enough Christian terminology to tranquilise a herd of elephants and lots of lovely shots of her getting up with tons of make-up on.

Thankfully, I have learned that this is how many trailers work, but I still go see a movie praying that I'm not wasting my hard-earned money on a really expensive and really long commercial; let me savor something! I was pleasantly surprised at The Exorcism of Emily Rose; going knowing that it's not only about her exorcism, but also about the trial that follows.This movie is also about alternatives,what ifs, and perceptions. A good movie for psychology majors--as am I--who are trying to learn about mental illness, diagnosis, and the DSM-IV.You don't need to know much about Emily, science, exorcism, or the Bible to be able to follow this movie; but, if you do, it'll definitely make you raise questions about your own faith, beliefs, and what you've learned throughout life about yourself.Will you like this movie?

You will like this movie if 1.) you are of Catholic faith or are struggling with your Catholic faith. or 2.) your religious education level has not surpassed the 11th century. Sorry, but this movie is like ""The Exorcist"" meets Law and Order. Nothing provocative, nothing new. Just the same old stuff. I call this type of horror, ""Catholic Horror"". It's only scary if you are religious or are scared of religion. It's like all other Pop horror. Special effects and imagery are all standard. Looks just like ""The Ring"", or any of those other ones. Not scary at all. I'm not even saying I don't believe in demons, but if demons were real, they wouldn't ""possess"" someone in such an obvious physical way. If they were smart they'd take a far more psychological approach. The Demonic Poessession thing is so primitive and this idea simply can't hold up in modern society.

Selecting some elements from her symptoms,'exorcism' and death and the subsequent trials, the movie tells a slightly similar story. Although cleverly disguised as an 'objective' court-room drama/thriller, in actuality the movie discreetly implies that the girl might have been possessed rather than simply suffering from a mental disorder. The tagline of the movie is ""It is possible (that demons possess people)"". (The Vatican must be a big fan of this movie...)In reality, Anneliese's death was explicitly due to the negligence of her parents and the priest who was trying to 'exorcise' her severe sickness. The German court subsequently found all three guilty of negligent homicide (after which Vatican was quick to withdraw its initial approval for the priest to perform an exorcism ritual on the girl).A more honest and intelligent take on Anneliese Michel can be seen in the German movie Requiem. If you like to be aroused emotionally by fraudulent suggestions and fantasies or if you like feeling sorry for ignorant priests who take exorcism seriously, then you might enjoy this movie and its emotional yet disturbing message.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
383,jonomanley,Do not expect a horror movie.,8,21 September 2005,"One thing that can be certain about this movie is if you don't like horror or don't like courtroom dramas, then this movie is not for you.Some people complain that this movie was too boring because of the use of the courtroom scenes in between the scenes of possession and exorcism. What you have to realize is that the director is trying very desperately to steer the audience away from the ready-mix variety horror films that are already out there. If you want to be scared every three seconds, go watch one of the typical horror movies out their like Boogeyman (sorry Mr. Raimi), or The Ring Two. If a movie is presented in this constantly shocking way, then it because a type of pornography, an all out assault on the senses. By the end, you are so desensitized and tired of the constant jolting sequences and cheap scares that the climax is hardly that. What director Scott Derrickson seems to be trying to do with this film is the same thing that director Sam Raimi was trying to initiate with his early film ""The Evil Dead"" or Miike Takashi's ""Audition"". Both are films that use very quiet, lulling sequences to give you a chance to recover after startling or very loud scenes. This element of film making does not bore you, however, gives you just enough time to feel secure again. This creates a high/low effect in your ability to be scared or shocked, whereas most films today start out high, and because of this constant shock that the director tries to lay on you the climax is as useless and powerful as a wet firecracker.The courtroom scenes, in this instance were used to create this low effect and left the climax (both the actual exorcism and the reading of the verdict)to be an actual climax for the film, rather than finding out who the killer was after having figured it out before the opening credits were finished.If you can't tell already, I liked this movie. A lot. It's a refreshing change from most of the porno/horror movies out there today. But I will admit it has it's flaws. Just like all movies.But, just like Derrickson's other film ""Hellraiser: Inferno"" was a change from the rest of the Hellraiser series. Now, I'm not saying it was the best Hellraiser film, but it was more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. It's interesting to see new directors pave the way for new avenues of movies.So, like I always say to my customers at Blockbuster, you may not like this movie, but I certainly did. Don't listen to critics people, don't even listen to me, go see the movie yourself, make your own decisions.And one more thing. To the guy who reviewed this before me, when you said ""This was more like Exorcist II rather than Exorcist.."" Please...Unless you're really really mad at a movie, don't compare it to the Exorcist II. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was not supposed to be ""The Exorcist"" and if you went in expecting that, then I can see why you wouldn't like this movie.Hope you all enjoy.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The Exorcism of Emily Rose acknowledges something churches today deny. It acknowledges that a Christian can be possessed. Something I know to be true. I was raised in a Hindu cult that led to my own demonic experiences. I do not like to discuss these experiences in detail. I will only say that once when my parents took me to a psychic séance, the psychic told a woman she was talking to her dead sister. I saw an apparition in the form of a girl standing next to the psychic. The psychic gave a description of the girl to the woman, and the woman verified it was her dead sister's description. Afterward, as we were leaving, I looked over my shoulder and saw the apparition of the girl change its shape. What I saw scared the hell out of me. I realized I wasn't seeing a ghost, but something else I wasn't supposed to see. This was the beginning of a series of horrific experiences which only got worse the more I tried to get away from my parents' religion. At age 17, I converted to Christianity without my parents' knowledge. I'd love to say the experiences suddenly stopped when I did, but they actually got worse, and I eventually came to understand the reason. These entities hate God with such intensity that they seek to condemn anyone who follows God. However, my faith in Christ is the reason I am still alive today. These experiences nearly cost me my life and the lives of people close to me. I believe that possession is very rare, but it can happen. This movie is the most realistic film on this subject. It conveys an important truth: Most cases of possession do not result in the victim becoming homicidal. Quite the opposite. In most cases, the demon seeks to kill the possessed, as is the case in this movie. It was also the case with Anneliese Michel, the girl this movie is based on. She never killed anyone. Instead, she was the one who got killed. Further, she did nothing to invite these things in, which is often the case with possession. Usually, possession occurs in a child who is sexually abused, as was the case with me. However, Anneliese Michel was not abused. She targeted simply because of her faith. This is something else the church denies, and unfortunately the church blames the victim of the possession, saying it has occurred due to a lack of faith. The other myth this movie debunks is the false belief that a simple Christian prayer will make a demon (biblically a fallen angel) go away. Unfortunately, this is not the case. This film accurately portrays how hard it is to get rid of something like this by the fact of the failed exorcism. Even the bible states that some of these spirits can only be driven out by continuous prayer and fast. It also warns that once cast out, these entities will search for another host, but when unable to find one, will return to their original victim with seven demons more wicked than itself. This shows how hard it is to fight something like this. Anneliese Michel had several exorcisms performed on her. They all failed. Why? Because these entities have no fear. They operate on a fierce determination born out of pure hatred. This movie does an excellent job of portraying the horrific nature of these fallen angels without using blood, violence, or ridiculous special affects. The movie is frightening for what it truly is. It has sparked serious conversation and deep thought among Christians about the subject of possession and why it really happens. I strongly recommend it to believers and nonbelievers alike. It isn't just a horror movie. It's also a spiritual drama with a deep purpose. I'm not easily impressed with movies on this subject, but this movie exceeds all my expectations. Don't expect a Hollywood ending, because you won't get one. One thing this movie makes clear is demons are nothing to mess with. In true form, they look like angels, because they used to be angels. All the more reason to be careful. None of us would leave our children with someone we don't know just because he/she looks nice. Most criminals look normal and decent. Demons are the same way. They don't look frightening. They can take forms intended to frighten, such as the hooded figure Lucifer takes in this movie. I have seen similar forms in my life by things like this. However, they will only take frightening forms to those who pose a threat to the evil they are trying to reap. They will take these forms to intimidate the individual they see as a threat or to intimidate the person they are possessing. This is the case with the priest in this movie. Lucifer appeared to him in the form of a hooded figure in an attempt to frighten him from performing the exorcism. I cannot list enough reasons why I appreciate this movie, but I will warn anyone who hasn't seen it that it is very disturbing. I would not recommend allowing young children to see this movie. I will one day recommend my son watch it, but not until he is old enough, and only if he feels he can handle it. My wife was unable to watch the movie because of her own memories, and this is very understandable. This movie is not for everyone. For those who have encountered something like this, this movie may be too frightening. It frightens me, and I am not easily frightened. However, I admire the courage that Emily Rose and Father Moore show in this movie, and find this movie to be an inspiration to me as a man of faith.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
386,mail-642,not a blessing to us,5,19 September 2005,"My wife and I just went to see the film in Santa Barbara and we didn't like it for the following reasons: - it doesn't glorify God - only teaches that demons are real (but shows no escape plan) - talks about the mother of God (though God doesn't have or needs a mother) - misuses the term ""work out your own salvation with fear and trembling"" - the pastor never showed a hint of love for the poor girlBesides all that we really found the film boring and didn't like most of the acting.

387,joleneb607,Good film,6,10 November 2013,"It helps of course that the cast all deliver quality performances, the obvious standout being Jennifer Carpenter as Emily. Her possession scenes are nothing short of incredible, the sheer torment she seems capable of portraying is utterly captivating. Laura Linney also shines in the lead, giving a powerful and affecting performance as the attorney of the convicted priest who performed Emily Rose's exorcism. As said priest, Tom Wilkinson also manages to impress, delivering a quietly effective and very human performance. My only complaint is that the characters of Campbell Scott and Colm Feore were really badly written, coming off as the typical antagonistic figures, and nothing more. Both give satisfying performances, despite their one dimensional characters, especially Feore, who has always been talented at taking terribly written characters, and giving them life and personality nonetheless. So The Exorcism of Emily Rose may not quite be the very best of its genre, but it certainly proves to be one of the more intelligently made ones. The director seems to have for once taken that extra step, and put aside the endless thrills and shocks in favor of making us think a bit. There are some cheesy effects, such as the demonic visions, but there are some genuinely frightening parts, especially the actual exorcism scene, mainly due to the chilling and captivating performance from Jennifer Carpenter as the title character. The principle cast members, Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson also give strong performances, bringing many layers to their characters. Quite the quality piece overall, and one worth seeing.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
388,vera-bishop,Absorbing and Shocking!,10,24 March 2012,"""Emily Rose"" was a great and powerful film.It was a great idea to center the film around the court case, rather than going for a straight horror approach. The whole medical explanation vs spiritual explanation debate of the case is what makes the film so entertaining. And they leave it open ended, as both sides plead their case very well, leaving some audience members convinced of one, others convinced of the other.Regardless, it gets the audience thinking, examining, exploring the possibilities available. Very well done. Great script, great visually, great sound. Very very well done. Strong performances by Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson (who even looks like a priest), Jennifer Carpenter, Campbell Scott, and Duncan Fraser. I really enjoyed this film. One of the most gripping and entertaining films of the year, by far. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing who's going to win the trial, as the momentum sways back and forth. I highly recommend seeing this film. In a year of terrible films, this one has few peers.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
389,insomniac2006,why do great actors do bad films?,4,19 September 2005,"If the intention of this movie is to do Emily Rose any sort of justice, director Scott Derrickson missed the mark. The story is supposedly based upon the true occurrence of the possession of a young girl (Jennifer Carpenter: White Chicks) and the attempt of a priest (Tom Wilkinson: Batman Begins, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) to save her. When the girl dies, either from Satan or science, the priest is blamed and charged with negligent homicide. After refusing a plea bargain which his defense attorney (Laura Linney: Kinsey, The Life of David Gale) urges him to take, the case goes to trial and the real horror begins. That is the horror that will forever be deeply ingrained in my soul that two such brilliant actors as Linney and Wilkinson would take this script. By constantly switching gears from Father Moore's mundane trial to Emily's undeniably eerie last days, any developing suspense is totally diminished. Derrickson should have studied up on the concept of flashback, but, then again, what can we expect from the writer/director of Hellraiser: Inferno? The real credit for this film belongs to Carpenter, who contorted herself into shapes I was not formerly aware the human body could take. Hopefully her role will lead her to bigger things, because her performance was excellent. Despite the blasé direction, the script had its moments. The lighting was well done, and the special effects were subtle but very effective. Both added to the ghostly ambiance of the flashback scenes. To quote a friend, ""It was trash, but it was good trash."" I have to admit there were disturbing highlights. For instance, when Emily first becomes possessed, she sees people's faces melt into demons. I blamed drugs, but that was later refuted by a doctor's educated testimony in yet another courtroom scene. Later in the film, the viewer receives the privilege of watching Emily eat spiders, and, let's be honest here, that's just downright creepy. Although the film had its moments, overall I was possessed with boredom.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It's very interesting to see how they try to establish if Emily was indeed possessed or if she was simply a very sick girl. But don't get me wrong. The moments where they show her being possessed or excised will definitely make you shiver. Very nice special effects and a very good performance from Jennifer Carpenter.

They are not horror. They have a new designation. They are slasher flicks. This is NOT one of those films. It is creepy. It is frightening. It is truly a ""horror"" film. The fact that it is based on a true story makes it that much better. Whether or not you believe in Demonic possession or not, makes no difference. It's simply an on the edge of your seat scary movie. I took my two teenage sons to see it last night and when the movie ended, we all just sat there a few minutes without saying a word. Got up, left the theater in a state of stunned shock. The way the story is told is done very well. Not since Linda Blair's head did a full 360 (a little over 30 years ago), has a horror film creeped me out so much. I loved it. My boys loved it as well.

This movie shows you the horrors of a truly possessed girl. I consider more of a Christian teaching than a horror film. There were a few parts that made me jump, but overall, it is about a wrongly accused priest who loved this girl and wanted to save her. I think that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and I recommend it to any and all Christians, and perhaps those who know very little of the Christian faith.

If you don't believe me read up on it. READ ""The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel"". That is the true account book in which this movie is based. Basically the only things changed in the movie is it doesn't show Emily urinating herself and it changes the name of the characters for obvious reasons. Don't listen to the ""It's a rip off of the Exorcist"" people. This is no rip off. It is completely a new thing. Too many people wanna convince you that this is stupid and not scary and is ""A COURTROOM DRAMA"". This isn't true.

It has a rather misleading trailer, and the plot is actually taking place inside a courtroom, which the trailer only shows us for a sec. It has minimum special effects, because the point is the story of Emily Rose and what happened to the priest who did the exorcism, not the exorcism itself (see the exorcist if you want hard core). So, in conclusion, it's a good movie, but u can wait a bit before you go and spend your money to a theater. In a few months it will be released in dvds.

396,Specksynder,"Way more than a mere ""Exorcist"" sequel....",7,31 January 2006,"Combine the atmosphere of the original ""Exorcist"" with the plot twists of a well set and scripted judicial movie and you have an outcome that ranges on occasions from the mere spooky , to a whole new level touching a frame of issues around the ""faith vs reason"" nucleus, visualized through the compelling performances by Liney and Wilkinson. The story revolves around the exorcism of a young girl and the trial which follows her death with the priest performing the ritual in the seat of the accused. The filmmakers adopt a bipolar structure in the representation of the events leading to the exorcism (the intrusion's a evil spirit/onset of a psychotic disorder) corresponding roughly to the ""religious-empiric"" and ""scientific-analytic"" points of view. In this way the underlying(?) issue of faith vs reason is kept alive and is portrayed in the intellectual and emotional transformation of the heroine during the length of the trial. In one instance this confrontation of science against religion is depicted in an a scene teeming with symbolism where the medical examiner finds himself face to face with the distraught priest leaving the room of the dead girl. The manifestation of the opposing sides of human nature could not have found a more suitable expressive medium, in this one scene. The photography does more than its fair share in creating a proper (psychologically unsettling for the viewer) environment for the events depicted, attaining peaks such as the introductory scene of the medical examiner entering the house where the overall coldness of the lighting and the range of colors constitute an almost otherworldly image. In terms of atmosphere and overall immersion the direction performs exceedingly well and in some films (particularly of this genre) that is one virtue sorely needed to create a coherent outcome.

397,frodo_688,Philosophically Successful,10,22 December 2005,"Philosophy, faith, politics--that's the stuff this movie is made of. Is it right to bring up God in a court of law? Can a nonbeliever really represent a man of God? What is the nature of evil? All these questions and more this movie represents, according to the original intentions of those who made this movie. This movie was a noble manifestation of noble--and vital--questions that every person should ask themselves regularly in their lives. More than that, it is entertaining in addition to thought-provoking--visually stunning, and a wonderful window into the world of the supernatural. Oh, come to this movie to be entertained--come to it to be challenged--but do not expect to go away without either sentiment. I may also take this opportunity to state the immediate inherent ties the movie received with The Exorcist from so many--this movie has stood its ground in triumph over that one. The Exorcist was irreverent, profane--certainly repellent to persons of faith (like myself); this movie took no side in the ever-ensuing debate over faith and fact, fact and possibility; and presented no such evil to the extent that its wrongly-called predecessor in exorcism movies did. I congratulate the makers for so easily and wisely shouldering off that burden from the beginning, making a film to unite horror and courtroom movies, and to provoke thought rather than simply to entertain those who take no offence in profanity.

401,adriankoh-1,Fact versus Faith in a courtroom setting with a little Exorcism thrown in,7,15 February 2006,"This is an interesting hybrid of two film genres: courtroom drama and religious horror. I am a fan of both genres, so I found it doubly enjoyable, especially with the immensely watchable Laura Linney in the central role.Ms Linney plays a seasoned and ambitious lawyer who is assigned to defend a Catholic Priest who (it is claimed) is responsible for the death of a young girl (Emily Rose of the title) entrusted into his care. A self-proclaimed agnostic, Ms Linney's character finds herself questioning her own beliefs (or lack of them) during the course of the trial, by the end of which there is little doubt that her life will have changed forever.As always, the courtroom stuff makes entertaining drama, though it may not pay to look too closely at the main legal premise (the principle of ""causation"" is never satisfactorily established); but the primary focus of interest is, ultimately, the philosophical conflict between the 'rational' (fact) and the 'spiritual' (faith), highlighting the issue of the role of religion in the 21st century. For the characters in the drama, there will of course be no definitive answers, though the makers of the film clearly intend otherwise for the viewer by introducing flashback sequences that can only be explained in supernatural terms - in a sense a mistake, perhaps, as this detracts from the essences of both debating perspectives.These flashback sequences however do provide the vehicle for the film's horror elements: demons and ghosts; moving objects; mysterious shadows; even the devil himself, it seems. There is much subtle borrowing from classics like the Omen and of course the Exorcist, but some of the horror ideas are original, like the scene where Emily is found out of bed all contorted. All entertaining stuff, if you like that sort of thing, but almost certainly window dressing for the film's core plot.Another important theme the story explores is that of commitment and sacrifice. The Priest, all but completely abandoned, refuses to depart from what he sees as his chosen responsibility to Emily Rose (""to tell her story""), even at the risk of incarceration. As a backdrop, it lays the foundation for the fact/faith debate; on screen it leads ultimately to the unleashing of the most disturbing vision of all that the film has to offer.The film is nicely photographed and the story is coherently presented. The cast is not A List, but more than competent. Other than Laura Linney, the film features Tom Wilkinson as the priest, sporting an uncomfortable American accent; Campbell Scott as the Prosecutor; veteran Mary Beth Hurt as the abrasive but fair-minded judge; and newcomer Jennifer Carpenter as the unfortunate Emily Rose. All acquit themselves well, but it is Linney you watch, Linney you root for, and Linney who completely dominates the film.Which of course is never a bad thing.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Whatever the case,it was tragic. I will add the actor playing Emily could really scream up a storm. The movie was also pretty faithful to the actual trial from what I could see. I attended a preview last week and will probably see it again when it comes out. The restraint of the film was noted by me and my friends too,because it didn't scare solely for the sake of sensation.

Though the commercials showed scenes of a young girl in distress from seeing numerous demons and ghouls everywhere, there are hardly any of these scenes in the actual movie.

406,davidlibrarian,Pleasantly and Annoyingly Ambiguous,7,15 September 2005,"This film has more in common with the Amityville Horror than The Exorcist. Interestingly, as the article located at http://www.catholic.org/cathcom/national_story.php?id=16563 explains, The Exorcist might have been an influence upon the residents of the little German town of Klingenberg (home of the actual girl), having been shown approximately one year before the actual events. Felicitas D. Goodman is the author of the book, ""The Exorcism of Anneliese Michel,"" that details the occurrence of the real story.To its credit, this film works its charm slowly and without any over-the-top special effects in order to achieve its eerie reference to evil. In this respect, it is like Amityville. Simple movements of the door and other objects suggest the presence of a malignant force. The more obvious similarity between the two is the 3am clock display and its significance with demons. On the other hand, the point of view of the film comes off as somewhat questionable. There does appear to be an attempt to show both sides, however, the viewer is often taken so far inside any given situation that the events that occur seem less convincing (or even meaningful) than the description provided by the voice-over narration. Like in Lauren Linney's film, The Mothman Prophecies, this work is both pleasantly and annoyingly ambiguous. It would also have been nice if the film had included the possibility that the ""hell"" Emily experienced was self-generated, and not just a matter of simply being either an internal or external separate force. The idea we humans are limited in how twisted and sick we can become just isn't realistic.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The dialog is sometimes sparse, though sufficient enough to allow your own thoughts to fill in the blanks. I don't need everything explained to me. This movie is written in a manner that assumes a reasonable level of intelligence.Good acting. Laura Linney, as the defense attorney, gets better as the movie progresses. She looks and sounds like a real person in a very difficult position. By the end of the movie I can't take my eyes off of her, and can't help but hang on every word. Tom Wilkinson, as the priest, is always believable. Both ultimately take the high road, though Linney's character needs some coaching to do so from Wilkinson's character.Bad marketing?

409,MCtF,"1/2 Fun, 1/2 Dull",5,5 December 2005,"The Exorcism of Emily Rose is, much like Emily herself, a confusing movie. I saw the Portuguese Preview and for the first half, it intrigued me. I was glued to the seat following the plot. First of all, let me clear something up: this is NOT a scary movie. You can get scared by it (loud noises, the usual stuff) but it isn't scary in the sense that you have to sleep with your lights on. And why? Because of it's 2nd part. When the Indian doctor comes to court to testify, the film takes a dive and never comes back. It jumps from Religious Thriller to Recover-Your-Faith style of movie...and that absolutely destroys it. (Notice that the Indian woman never stops shaking her head, bad stereotype...). The movie starts revolving more around the court room procedures and the lawyer regaining her faith than on Emily and her so called possession. The possession scenes, although creepy, aren't given the attention that they deserved (because they are the best part of the movie). I couldn't help to notice that Emily looks a lot like the X-Men characters Toad (black eyes, jumping and all that) and Sabretooth (the scratching and biting) but that's just me (altough that would be a wicked twist) :) If they had cut the movie before the Indian doctor and put in the possession and some nice follow up, then this movie would have been much better. But as it is, a story not about Emily, but about an attorney who recovers her faith in God and saves some backwoods preach to some degree of ineptitude from the prosecutor (those constant objections completely destroyed it) make this movie a 5. Not all bad, but not all it could have been....",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

412,quezadawife,Not A Typical Scary Movie,8,28 December 2005,"The movie did an excellent job of getting the story out. I felt as though the intention of the movie was not to scare me (although it did in some aspects), but to tell a story. The story took on different perspectives and was based on the actual events of the trial that had occurred. The trial just happened to focus on an frightening event which helped to make it a scary film. The movie offered the viewer to take a chance and consider that maybe these events that were being told of might have happened the way they were being told. Although it discusses religion and demons, the movie neither proves nor disproves its ideas. It is simply a story about the trials. Everything we saw happening to Emily was through the perspective and belief of those involved somehow. The movie surprisingly has a touching and intellectual aspect that might disappoint some audiences who wanted ""just a scary movie"". The movie captures you, but not in they way you expect it to, and that it was makes it a good movie for an audience: unpredictability",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
413,alanogilby,Emily Rose; well worth watching if you are interested in that subject,8,4 February 2006,"This is a film that makes everyone who sees it question their beliefs without even knowing it sometimes. It cannot be compared to other films of the same nature such as the Exorcist. It is good that this film does not focus on the actual ritual of the exorcism throughout the entire show. the court room scenes are excellent and I like the way the the story is being told in court and then flashs back to the actual events being talked about. This is a film which has many twists and the fact that it is loosely based on a true story adds to the excitement. From a religious point, it really does make you question the whole good/evil thing but it really depends on your beliefs. as it is mostly a courtroom based movie, there is going to be the climax at the end of Guilty/Not Guilty but again, waiting for this whilst hearing all the different arguments adds to the excitement. One criticism I do have is that after I watched this, I found myself on the Internet trying to research Emily Rose to find out how much this is 'loosely based on a true story'. I found out that it is based on a girl who was possessed in Germany but a lot of parts were changed for the purpose of entertainment.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

To me in todays life people forget that,even though they go to Chruch and believe in God that there is a Heaven and hell and they are very real,this movie,to me,opened peoples eyes.Even though you cant see things doesn't mean they are not there!To me, this movie is trying to let people know that God is alive and walking among us and that He is trying to help us change and he would never forsake us.Even though somethings cant be understood through science,doesn't make it any less real,also there is somethings doctors cant fix, only God alone, through His will ,can fix it! I, myself, am not that smart and there is a lot of things I don't understand,but I believe in God and I believe in the devil and this movie brought a lot of things forward. It also shows that it doesn't matter of what faith you are there is only one God!This film brought out so much that it is really hard to comment on one thing,but the part were ,after the first exorcism, she goes and sees the Virgin Mary,and She tells Emily that she has not been forgotten and gives her the choice,to me that showed that no matter how much we may suffer on earth that He will always be with us!To me this is one of the BEST movies ever made,and it gave me chills!The people that were in the movie were great,Laura Linney and Jennifer Carpenter were excellent.The setting ,to me, was terrific for movie,it went right along with the contents of the movie.

421,wfrazerjr,"If you like boring courtroom sequences centered on demonic possession, this one's for you.",3,17 September 2005,"I'm not a big fan of scary movies. I'm naturally a jumpy sort, and I don't see anything with a lot of graphic violence in it. I can't fathom why people complain about pornography, and yet they're glad to plunk down $10 to see dismemberments and shootings. Nice values.In spite of this, I gladly went along with my wife choice of our Friday night flick -- ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose."" I do like a good spook story, and I assume a PG rating to mean there will not be wanton use of chainsaws and machetes.Unfortunately, this film's screenwriters cast out the demons of excitement and intensity through the choice of setting. Despite what the trailers show, 90 percent of ""Emily Rose"" takes place in a courtroom, as the story centers on the trial of the priest who attempted the exorcism. You go in expecting pea-soup fountains and spinning heads and wind up with ""Brimstone & Order."" This isn't to say the movie isn't a little scary. There are moments of enjoyable creepiness and fright, and the understated special effects are more jarring than might be expected. ""Emily Rose"" does nice work in paralleling possession with the prosecution's explanation of a possible combination of psychosis and epilepsy.But the trial sequences come off hokey and predictable, and the insight into Laura Linney's defense attorney are too cliché -- she drinks, she's gotten an acquittal for a man who ends up murdering again, she's trying to make partner. Tom Wilkinson's turn as Father Moore is decent, but he's just not given much to work with here. He seems awfully damned calm for a guy scrapping with Lucifer, and there's just no ""The power of Christ compels you"" for him here.And Campbell Scott, who I don't know much about, is atrocious as the prosecuting attorney. The character is meant to be starchy and stuff, I'm sure, but it's tough to take a guy with an 80s porn-star mustache and Snidely Whiplash overtones too seriously.Give Jennifer Carpenter credit for slogging through this. She plays possessed pretty well, with the requisite gnashing of teeth and screaming, but the screenwriters never give us a chance to know her and like her before Satan sublets her soul.What really galls me, though, is this whole ""based on a true story"" crap. I'm not going to go into much detail, but a little research will show the actual case turned out much differently than the movie does, including the conviction of both the priest and the parents. Anneliese Michel is a German girl from the late 60s/early 70s who more than likely was seriously ill rather than possessed, not a farm girl in the 80s who got screwed over by the devil.You might jump a little in your seat, but ""Emily Rose"" withers and dies before the end of the first scene.

422,vteam2002,And yet it could have been so much better...,4,27 July 2006,"Emily Rose presents some wonderful modern twists on the faith vs fact debate. Christians will love it for its validation of their role in the battle of Good vs Evil, atheists for its validation that Christians are out of their minds (agnostics, of course, will continue to ponder).The movie is a new take on the exorcism theme, and for that alone its worth seeing. Exorcism movies are always about extraordinary events set against the background of everyday reality, but in Emily Rose the two worlds collide into horror movie vs courtroom drama. Although its based on an account from an anthropologist who investigated an exorcism case, its hard to pick out what bits of the story come from that source. Jennifer Carpenter as Emily is amazing actress. Her possessed scenes are riveting; she totally has the right look and holds nothing back. I shudder to think of how she researched the role. Unfortunately she is the only ""believable"" character in the entire movie. The rest are caricatures. I think the dialog could have been improved, as some of it is a bit over the top.Overall, because of some very interesting side twists, Emily Rose is worth the ride. Unfortunately the parts that are ridiculous take away from what should be considered a breakout performance for Jennifer Carpenter.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
423,cherylannsanders,"Superbly portrayed, although potentially a stretched story",10,5 September 2006,"The tone of this film sets it far apart from typical courtroom dramas and stories of the demonic or supernatural. Despite the fact that the movie takes it's leave from reality (as 'based on a true story' films often do), it does so in an incredibly tasteful and classy manner. The film is devoid of typical courtroom melodrama (you know the type - screaming, yelling lawyers behaving in ways that defy normal rules of conduct) which is, in and of itself, quite refreshing.But even more refreshing is the portrayal of the extremely sensitive topic of demonic possession. In this film you are not forced through the beliefs of any particular faith, religious doctrine essentially does not make an appearance. Demonic possession is presented as an experienced believed by many around the world and is not associated with any specific religious belief system. Instead we see two opposing opinions (medical versus spiritual) surrounding the afflictions experienced by a young girl and, although the story centers around the spiritual, it can be enjoyed regardless of which opinion you share.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

The priest which performs the actual exorcism(Tom Wilkinson) is being accused of the murder of Emily Rose( EXCELLENT performance from Jennifer Carpenter).Things aren't nor simply or can be easily comprehended and there isn't a logical explanation of whatever has happened during Emily's ""illness"" and ""curing"".

If i would've known how it ended I never would've watched it in the first place. The entire case was based on the fact that there was no doctor giving her any medical treatment. A doctor was present the night the exorcism was performed!! How can a priest be charged with negligent homicide if a doctor was there?? The ruling at the end is insane!!

I also recommend this movie for those who really want their pants scared off of them, because this movie messes with your mind afterwards. Just remember to watch a happy movie right before you go to bed, and to leave a light on, and by a night or two, it won't scare you as much.

I say different. It's now my favourite movie. All those sensitive people out ther would enjoy it as much as I did. The movie had a very meaningful message(if there was one), fight till the end.

436,RoniRossa,An Advertising Problem?,6,12 September 2005,"It seems to me that the major problem with The Exorcism of Emily Rose lies in how the average moviegoer perceives the movie as he or she is walking into the theater to view it. On Saturday night, opening weekend, I was expecting a horror movie, full of creepy supernatural effects and the kinds of abstract, anonymous, ambiguous horrors that really create and instill a unique sense of fear in me. I was let down.What people should understand when walking into this movie is that, primarily (in terms of time on screen), this movie is a courtroom drama. The emphasis plot wise is on the story of Emily Rose, but her story does not receive as much screen time as the courtroom. As a result, the entire movie is cloven in two, really.On the one hand, you have a courtroom drama that revolves around what really constitutes reckless endangerment, reasonable doubt, and some other courtroom jargon. Yes, faith is brought up as an issue, but the filmmakers did a good job of not making it the primary focus of the plot, and instead they shifted the perspective to one of, ""How is this person's belief relevant to this case?"" So, in that sense, the courtroom drama part of the movie was played out rather well. Overall, however, I felt that this part of the movie lacked the kind of emotional punch that one might get from watching Chicago or (especially) A Few Good Men. (And really, what else do courtroom dramas have going for them other than emotional punches?)Now, if I were to rate only the courtroom drama part of the movie, I would give it about a 6.5. However, there's more to the movie. The story of Emily Rose is told through flashbacks that you get either through witness testimony in the courtroom or in personal interviews conducted between the defendant, father Moore, and his legal counsel, Erin Bruner. Well, to be succinct, the horror aspect of this movie is accomplished through moments, really: startling images, well-done crescendos built by music, sound, and lighting, and recurring themes are really the only scary facets of this film. The individual moments within themselves are very well-constructed and executed (I thought the music really pulled through a few scenes), but in the overall perspective of a horror movie, this film falls just a bit short of the mark.6/10. I'd recommend this movie to horror fans and anyone else who really just wants to see it. If you're not sure you want to see The Exorcism of Emily Rose, I would recommend saving your money for something else.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

I was aware going into it that the movie is based around a court trial, but unfortunately the trial is most of the movie. There were so many times that they built up a creepy moment and then return to the court for another long drawn out sequence. Unfortunately the court room scenes tended to diminish the effects of the horror sequences. The only true scare in the movie has nothing to do with the exorcism. When and if you see the movie you'll see what scene I mean.Don't get me wrong, it's still a decent movie (these days I base how good they are by whether or not I fall asleep during the show :) ), it just wasn't a great movie. Wait to see it on DVD and save yourself some $$$.Horror movies (excluding Grudge, The Ring and Amityville Horror) are really becoming lame. We need REAL horror and originality.

438,tolchocker,Demonic possession or mental and physical ailment?,6,26 August 2005,"Scott Derrickson does many things right in this little ""courtroom horror"" picture. His possession scenes are top notch, with most of the chills coming from jarring camera work and generally only subtle special effects. Rarely is a special effect in this film more than a digitally altered scary face or subtly enhanced human ability (as often seen in The X-Files). The rest is done through editing, lighting, and scoring. I believe that Derrickson did this for a very specific reason - to add credibility to both sides of the courtroom argument. Was Emily possessed by demons or mentally/physically ill? Emily's feats of strength, obscene bodily contortions, and other frightening abilities can all be explained by both science and religion. For some of the more supernatural moments that Emily experiences, Derrickson lets us observe from two perspectives: demonic influence and objective science. Since this is of course a horror picture, there are noticeably more scenes of the former. This is a good thing because Derrickson unfortunately does not handle drama very consistently in this picture. Several key moments in the film, including a fervent assertion made by the district attorney, that should have resonated with the audience instead made everyone in the theater laugh at the scene's ridiculousness. Still, the scares are top notch (particularly a long exorcism scene which begins like Friedkin's Exorcist but then takes some surprisingly different turns) and presenting both religious and scientific explanations for the possessions (which was never an option for the head-spinning, levitating Reagan) will satisfy both believers and skeptics. Worth seeing.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
439,scootr5255,I definitely believe!,10,25 May 2008,"I heard it said in the movie, if I believe in Satan, what does that mean about God? This happened to me. I was dating someone that was NOT GOOD, and one night he started to say something to me, ""Im Satan, I'm Satan! He was scaring the crap out of me. Then I remembered what my sister, a born again Christian said to me, that if anything ever happens to you and you are frightened you can say I rebuke you in the Name of Jesus. I wasn't yet a Christian, well maybe in name only but not exactly by faith. He stole money from me on this one night, was claiming he was Satan, he has also raped me, by holding me down while his young friend had his way with me. When I rebuked him in the Name of Jesus, his chair flipped completely over backward. Then I went to a club a few days later and I tried acid that night, but only a half a hit because I was afraid of it. At the end of the night I was completely sober. What I saw! A couple were close to having sex against the wall, another girl was vomiting in the corner, just a mishmosh of such bad situations and I was the only sober person there, and I said to myself Satan has to be real, and if Satan is real, that God has to be real. I soon went to church and gave my heart and life to Jesus. I've been free from the fears and guilt of my past and totally at peace. A church had a man come in looking for help with his possession. The altar was covered in red velvet. My husband who was there saw his fingernails grow before his eyes as he tore the velvet to shreds just like when Emily clawed the wallpaper in her room. I then experienced a man that came to our church, but I'm not sure he really was looking for help, he went to the front of the church where we all were worshiping and he started to mock and swear at our pastor loudly. He said terrible things, tremendous vulgarity. Pastor asked all those that were not sure of their relationship and also young children to please leave the building. You never know when the demons will come out and go into another host. I think he just ended up needing to be removed because he was just there to make trouble. They have to want to be set free.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
440,jahwomble,awful,1,11 June 2010,"The exorcism of Emily Rose,really is an average to pretty mediocre courtroom drama, made worse by the constant and heavy handed introduction of blatant Christian propaganda permeating pretty much every scene. It's one redeeming factor was Jennifer Carpenter's superb performance,her scenes unfortunately were few and far between though, she really worked for her fee here. It felt to me from quite early on that the message about the agnostic lawyer eventually accepting the existence of a god was just really obviously and the whole point of the film. So unless you really want to sit through what feels like hours of pro Christian cinema, don't bother.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Then there is the highly pertinent subject considering the moral forces at work in present day American leadership and direction, if one wants to consider the film from that perspective, as I unavoidably do. How superstition is treated in relation to verifiable fact was depicted again on an even keel I think, although I do not understand how an objective judge could not have sentenced him for negligent homicide. To keep people alive, all avenues must be treated equally, not negligently as this man and the church did.

Is Emily's death cannot be controlled by medicine ? Way two thumbs up . This is not the movie it is the open lesson of unanswered questions.Best philosophical movie ever made.This movie takes you to the edge of your seat . Not recommended for children's under 14.It shows you what happened to Emily Rose who can't be saved by medicine but can by Exorcism but leads to God who wants his power to be shown by taking Emily's life and showing he still exists.Go grab your tickets if you want to see a best philosophical movie .Some scenes are so scary that you avoid seeing them .,The Exorcism of Emily Rose

There are many great things about this movie. The acting is great and you get really drawn into the trial, and the Exorcism scenes are very convincing and are very close to what an actual possession is like ( I read about paranormal phenomenon, it is a personal hobby) and is closer to the real thing than the exorcist. It was great to see an accurate-to-the real-thing ( possessions not the actual story of Anneliese Michel, which the story can be read on my new site at brandonsparanormalpage.bravehost.com; the only other remotely accurate to the subject phenomena is White Noise .

I gave it a 10 because I really like the movie and I think you'll enjoy it if you don't go in thinking it's a ""scary movie"". It has a wonderful cast of actors who did a very convincing portrayal.

Before watching please be aware the Jesus loves you and if you are in danger or scared you can call out His name, and He'll be there. Even if your mixed up with the occult in some way, Jesus died for you too. Call out to Jesus Christ, tell Him you know He died for you, Ask for forgiveness for your sins(in action or in thought, sin is sin, we all sin ie.thinking this about someone ""I could kill you"" is sin). Know that Jesus is truth and the Devil is a liar, to the point that he's convinced himself that he could still win the battle of good and evil. He is wrong, he has already lost everything, including any right to any human being. If you think otherwise, YOUR BEING LIED TO. I tell you that I have myself casted demons, not because I am special in any way, but because I believe every word in the Bible. If it says go out into the world and heal, cast demons, speak in tongues...it's true. Period. Just know this before you watch this. Blessings be to God. God bless Anneliesa Michel.

I wouldn't recommend this as a horror film, but it's a pretty good thriller and it has some great takes. The court scenes are also part of what makes this a good film, it leaves you waiting for more, and helps you understand the story a bit better. I honestly think the IMDb score doesn't do the film any justice, even if it's not ""gore enough"" or gore at all, it does have some jumpy scenes.

451,danafrancaix,2 hour Law and Order Episode....,7,10 September 2005,"This was the longest episode of Law and Order that I have ever seen. It's a good thing I like Law and Order,but I don't need to pay $8.50 just to see it. It comes on 3 different channels and there are 10+ years worth of episodes. The commercial trailers for ""Emily"" were misleading. They tried to make it seem like the movie was about Emily and they gave away all of the ""scary scenes"" and none of the plot. The three main stars (Two lawyers and a Priest) were hardly seen in the trailers. The script also leaves something to be desired. ""There are demonic forces all around."" ""We need to tell Emily's story."" blah blah blah, you could almost predict what people were going to say. The actors worked well with what they were given, thankfully.My biggest complaint involves the content of the movie. The ""real"" Emily Rose was a young lady named Anneliese Michel from Germany who was , in fact, not possessed by the devil. She had seizures and psychosis for some 8 years before her exorcisms started and didn't believe that she was possessed until a priest convinced her that she was. The movie places the characters in modern day America (the US) and adds other elements to make the viewer believe that there are demons at work in and out of the courtroom. The movies makes the audience believe that Emily is suddenly taken over by the devil one day while she is at school. The movie does a good job of telling Emily's story. But Anneliese's story is lost at the expense of drama, suspense, horror, and potential movie profit. It reminds me of ""Fairy Tale: A True Story"", a 1997 movie about young girls who find fairies in their back yard that is supposed to be based on the ""true"" story of young girls who faked fairy photos in their backyard with their daddy's camera, cut-out fairy photos, and some bobby pins. This movie is good if you like:*Law and Order *Abnormal psychology *Religion (esp. if you are Catholic) *DemonsI happen to like all of the above, so I can give this movie seven stars. Watching the psychological explanations for Emily's behavior is quite entertaining. Based on the previews and the movie's ability to tell the real story, this movie is poor. But going into it with an open mind and seeing the movie for what it is (a crime drama with a few jolting flashbacks and some fairly good acting) might leave you feeling pleasantly surprised.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

There's not much to say that wouldn't spoil the ending, although the ending for the most part was slightly predictable. It's what happens before ... the flash-backs, trial testimony, the suspense that wasn't predictable. I will most likely see this again once it hits the theaters. I was not the only one in the theater to 'jump out of my seat'. Although only rated PG-13, I personally would not recommend viewing by anyone under the age of 18, due to the intensity and religious beliefs. And to know this was based on a true story is the most disturbing ... I'm still wondering if she was possessed, or was it actually epilepsy??

Memorable acting, and stunning visual features dotted the Law-and-Order skyline with creepy backgrounds and frightening acting on Jennifer Carpenters part. Worth seeing in the theater, and in my opinion, a possible Oscar-nominee nod for Jennifer for her harrowing portrayal of Emily Rose. Viewers of this movie will easily be moved to question their own values and thoughts about these controversial issues that dot our courtrooms, political libraries, hospitals and universities around the world.

It's actually much more of a courtroom drama - focused on supernatural versus scientific/medical views. You DO see the story of Emily Rose's exorcism, but the movie is actually more intensely focused on the priests role in the exorcism. There are actually a few major conflicts in the movie to hold your interest - Emily vs the demonS, the people vs the priest, and Erin (Linney) vs her religious beliefs.Overall an excellent movie with a great performance by Laura Linney (think Primal Fear).",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

One conversation I had with my girlfriend about a psychic experience she had indicated that a person is non-judgmental in the afterlife about earthly experiences and chooses what will best serve their evolution in the succeeding life.But the Exorcism of Emily Rose made me again wonder about people who die full of hate. Can they become objective or will they retain their hate? The movie did make me consider the idea of evil in other realms as well as in this one.

Would I have liked to see more scary, jump-outta-your-seat parts?? Yes. Did I wanna see a movie where there was nothing but special effects and pee-my-pants moments, but no plot or storyline?? No. So, I'm glad that Emily Rose turned out the way that it did. Too many movies today--especially scary movies--rely on scaring the crap outta people and not really making a movie because they know that the scenes that made them frightened are what they're gonna talk about...""Oh, man did you see that?!""..""That was such a cool special effect!""....""Did you see the way he sliced her up?!""(that last comment was for example---That comment was not to imply that there was or was not any ""slicing"" of anyone in the movie, The Exorcism of Emily Rose). But ask them what the movie was actually about and they won't have much to say.Don't go into Emily Rose expecting to be scared out of your pants or brought to tears. And PLEASE don't expect to walk into the theater expecting to see anything like The Exorcist or whatever other movie you've seen before that you think might be like this one because, frankly, that isn't fair to the directors and the producers who wanted to make their own movie and their own project about something they were interested in. Go into the the theater just wanting to be entertained,go in open-minded and maybe even willing to learn about something you heard about in the movie, because that's all people want when they make movies; they want you to think that it was good and they hope that their movie left some type of impression.

458,mynewaesthetic,For the Intellect and the Heart,8,28 April 2014,"This film isn't meant to scare the living heck out of you. Unless you're scared easily, it's probably not even meant to scare at all (I only jumped in my seat once, and my family swears I'm afraid of Beetlejuice). It's a movie dependent on chills and dread produced by that ""Based on a True Story"" teaser; it forces you to think more than you'd probably like to watching a supposed horror film. It's almost clever; it holds that eeriness over you, the kind where you're waiting for something more heart-racing to happen, but you're mostly left analyzing every new bit of information (e.g. what exactly happened with the first murderer Bruner put away? If this film isn't set in the '70s as the real case was, isn't it a little silly not to introduce the possibility of schizophrenia?). That itself had me on the edge of my couch, gripping the life out of my popcorn bucket (but I'm a knowledge nerd, so probably in the minority here). All around, I'm satisfied with the design and structure of the film. I think Derrickson went the right way with appealing to a instinctively hope-seeking audience, giving the viewers a choice in whether they believe Father Moore is guilty or innocent, whether Emily is possessed or sick. And he does it in a way that you genuinely want to believe: in Erin as she goes through her own spiritual battle, in Emily's unwavering faith, and in Father Moore's devotion to Emily and his creed. It's a classic good-triumphs-over-evil story, even if you don't believe the evil exists. It's the possibility that it does that matters here.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It does not go for cheap jumps, easy scares or even show a scary monster. The part that gets to you it that it could be true. For hundreds of years people have claimed possession....this movie makes you really think about what if. The girl who plays Emily doesn't help. She contorts her body in these horrible poses that make the idea of it that much worse. A particular scene in the movie had no jump set up, nothing more than a camera pan to Emily on the floor....the whole audience gasped in shock. I have no way to convey why this movie was scary or why it got to me and most of the audience I saw it with, but it did. Many of us hurried from the theatre and to our cars. I came home and turned on lights. Hopefully I don't wake up at 3:00 am. I may not go back to sleep ever.

461,make-and-do,Learn from Emily Rose,8,12 September 2005,"This isn't so much of a review as it is a call to action. What Scott Derickson has achieved with The Exorcism of Emily Rose, is not only a well-crafted horror film, but also a thought provoking, discussion sparking, belief examination. How refreshing it is to walk out of a film and begin to intelligently discuss not only the story and questions presented in the film, but also the conversation that bleeds from this. And it's mainstream. People have and will see this movie because of its commercial appeal and they too, will discuss and ponder the questions. So, my call to action is two sided. The big one is to Hollywood: Learn from Emily Rose. People are sick of the re-makes, uninspired drivel and crave for originality and challenge. The second is to the ""independent"" filmmaker: Learn from Emily Rose. You're only as good as your audience says you are. Relevancy is the key. Compromise is never in the art, but only in the questions. What questions are the audiences of today asking? That's relevancy. Save your philosophical examination on maintaining purity in art for the film majors. Learn from Scott Derickson.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

First of all the anticipation of fear as i have been mentally scarred by the exorcist for years now so new what to expect. Boy was i wrong. Firstly the scenes of the possessed girl all be it freaky not quite what i expected. Then the feeling of contempt towards the lawyer who just wanted to earn a fast buck but ended up just as enthralled by the case as me. Then there's the girl herself tormented for years by not only the demons inside but the feeling of not knowing whether or not it was all in her head. Everyone telling her shes just ill but they cant see what she can. And finally we have the priest. A very prominent figure in my catholic upbringing. A constant reminder to me that this just might not be a Hollywood movie but an actual thing which could happen to anyone at any time.

The acting was ""Award winning"" for almost all of the cast! With minimal special effects the movie has some of the most spine tingling moments in it that I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of movies. The way that they portray the possession leaves you totally believing ""something evil"" was dreadfully wrong with this poor girl. The producers and director do a good job of showing both sides of the coin and it pretty much comes down to what YOU actually believe. I realized at one point while watching the movie that I almost forgot the same person played both ""Before Possession Emily"" and ""During Possession Emily"" she such a convincing job.

You end up feeling sorry for Emily too really because she just seems to be an average girl. The fact that she was like this made it even worse for me. It did actually tend to drag at the end when they were deciding the verdict for the priest but that was probably because we realised we had sat there for two hours already and I'm not too patient. Doing it as a sort of court room drama, it kept the plot going and gave the audience a breather.

I believe the majority of people will believe in it, WHICH freaks you out because then it really becomes real, maybe even around you.

Believe it or not this was the first horror movie that I found more funny than scary. Although I gotta admit the acting was actually pretty darn good. This is not a horror movie in my book I consider this movie to be a drama/thriller but not horror.

I am the type of person that can watch blood and guts all day long, but when it comes to the demonic or supernatural stuff I am just plain creeped out! This movie isn't necessarily ""scary"" but it certainly is disturbing! And in my opinion, a movie that creeps you out as much as this one did, is a good movie! With the exception of Emily's mother, I thought the acting was great! And although it starts off a little slow, it definitely picks up speed. The thing I liked most about this film is that it explains everything. Why do people get possessed? Especially those that are very religious, such as Emily Rose? Everything seems to come back full circle and well explained. And the movie lets the viewer choose for themselves, was this simply science(epilepsy) or demonic possession? Both are given in detail and allow you to make up your own mind and both are very convincing! After the movie I found myself thinking about this film the whole night.

I seen several parents in the theater with younger children ( 8,9,10,) way to young.But it is just pg-13 right? Wrong! This movie is way more R, than any movie I have seen so far in the 2.5 decades I have been watching movies. This was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.( I am no wimp, I thought ""the Exorcist"" was not scary.)But I found this movie terrifying.I say this to adults if you choose to watch it, so be it you have been informed. But do not let your children see it. And if your set on letting them. Let them watch it after you do. To wrap things up if you want scary movie, too scary, this is the one. If you want to go to relaxing night at the movies. ""run"" this is not the movie.Just remember this was not a fiction based movie.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

I had been waiting for this movie to hit video for quite some time, and when it did....WOW!!!! I'm exactly 36 minutes into this film, and let me emphasize......... WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!!!! This movie has absolutely no flow, no characters to even slightly care about, zero suspense and those are the highlights, people. Oh the creators tried to lead their audience down a path full of suspense and intrigue...blah blah blah. But, they failed miserably.We Were lulled into a state of mind like,""Oh, I hope that Laura Linney's character can solve the mystery of the inconsistent timepiece."" This movie successfully merged all the plagiarism of the true Exorcist film with the campiness of a Scooby Doo mystery.And before the nay-saying sheep pan me for not giving the film a chance(due to an apparent infatuation with a true original), choosing to enjoy this film because Hollywood forced it down their throats, lemme say this.....I don't even particularly worship the Excorcist movie other than to recognize it as a classic.Simply put, do not waste your time with this dog, lest you come back to hear me say...I TOLD YOU SO!!!! Only Laura Linney herself saves this from being a 1 out of 10.Excuse me, the movie has just hit the 55 minute mark and I have to put it back in the case before I begin to feel dumber than I did before it started.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
475,peggysue1959,Horror or Comedy?,2,10 September 2005,"I wasn't impressed with this movie at all. On the other hand, any horror film that has come out in recent years is pretty bad. Instead of gripping the chair during this one, you'll be more likely to burst out laughing--I did that several times.I didn't think that the graphics of the demons were that good in the scenes where Emily is being taken over. They looked more like a small child's nightmares rather than supernatural phenomenon.It also annoyed me that the locket was never opened. I left the theatre thinking to myself, ""The chick found a locket--shouldn't the locket contain something?"" I seriously thought that in the last scene when she gets into bed for the last night and looks at the clock, that she would open the locket to find a message from Emily after the trial, but I was left unsatisfied on that hope.I also feel as though the plot of this film, as well as the way it was laid out was designed to make agnostic people feel as though they should be die-hard Catholics. I thought it was very ironic when Moore asks Bruner if she practiced a religion or not. I definitely saw that coming.This film serves as a decent piece of comedy. I laughed through many of the scenes in which Emily acts out violently, such as during the failed exorcism.Hollywood really is going to hell.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
476,sawdeye,"Not perfect, but still a modern-day triumph",9,27 August 2005,"One of the trailers for ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is for the forthcoming 2005 remake of the John Carpenter movie ""The Fog."" While that movie will no doubt provide a thrill or two, just watching it, you know it won't be the same kind of level that the brilliant ""Emily"" brings. While that will have killings and ""boo"" moments and the usual, this movie right here is something intellectual, deliberately paced, and, ultimately, genuinely terrifying.While not revealing too much, the plot focuses on the trial of a priest (Tom Wilkinson), convicted with the negligent death of young Emily Rose (a breakout performance from Jennifer Carpenter). Laura Linney plays Erin Bruner, in charge of his defense, while Campbell Scott proves why he's one of the most under-appreciated actors today with his venomous role as the district attorney. The priest and Rose's family say she was possessed by a demon, while the prosecution says she was epileptic and the priest, Father Moore, ultimately lead her to her gory demise.This is where the movie turns convention on its head: the story is told almost entirely in flashback. While one would think that this would weaken the story, it does not. As a matter of fact, Father Moore's testimony on the exorcism itself and it's inherent flashback are the most terrifying events seen in cinemas for years. In viewing these sequences, one cannot help but think back to its superior and obvious forbearer: ""The Exorcist."" Yet, ""Emily"" is not a renamed remake of it by any means. As a matter of fact, for once you get to see what Emily sees, which is really drawing from more elements of the oft-neglected Tim Robbins' movie ""Jacob's Ladder"" than anything else. In a rare event, the special effects never ONCE look fake, adding further to the sheer terror of the film. The score is brooding and creates a squeamish and uneasy mood (especially during Emily's first ""posession"" in her dorm), and the script, for once, actually goes through religious symbolism analysis in compelling detail, not once ever dumbing down to the audience. This isn't a non-stop terror thrill ride - it's a smart one that knows when to play it safe, and when to scare your pants off.Given that, it should be noted that ""Emily"" isn't perfect. The script makes Father Moore say ""dark powers"" and ""dark spirits"" way too much, and a few might not like how it ends somewhat low-key (though the climax is extraordinary). Yet when you come down to it, you have a phenomenal horror movie. Hopefully it will ascend to the ranks of modern-day classics, and people won't write it off as derivative, because it's not. ""Emily"" will make you think, sometimes laugh (it knows when to place a good joke to break tension), but ultimately scare you - no other film in recent memory has done it better.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
477,alaina698,Glad I Saw It For FREE! IT'S HORRIBLE!,1,30 August 2005,"This movie was advertised as being a thriller, but what they don't show is that the whole thing is a trial. The only parts that are shown on television are the small sections that are flashbacks during the trial. The acting by the prosecutor (he's some unknown actor) is laughable, it's so bad. Laura Linney isn't anything to write home about, either. The people in the theater where I saw it (I saw it on the preview night, August 25), were laughing at all the wrong parts. I'm pretty sure we weren't supposed to be laughing during the prosecutor's opening statements, or when the defendant was recalling seeing a horrific demon; but as I said earlier, the acting was extremely novice. I am a high school teacher and I saw some of my students there. One of them said she fell asleep and the other one said that she and her boyfriend thought about leaving before the ending, but didn't because her mom would have made her go to bed early! I've seen children's movies with better endings and more bang for your buck. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE (especially if you are a horror movie fan!)",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
478,vikings_robert,"It was fantastic , but i have my gripes!!!!",8,9 September 2005,"this movie was quite a scary flick. an exorcist movie in todays times , i love it . the reason i only gave it an 8 ( really should be a 7.5 ) is because of the pg-13 rating . I'm not sure why Hollywood is trying to get a younger audience when this should be a rated ""R"" movie . i think if that were the case , this movie would almost compare to the scariest movie of all time ""The Exorcist"" . Anther complaint of this film was that being a courtroom type move , it felt like a super scary lifetime movie ( and i hate lifetime movies ). the last complaint i have ( I'm not sure if this was just the theater i saw it in ) but the audio was messed up . it sounded like all the voices were echo like . it really bugged me and gave me a headache. don't get me wrong about this movie . i thought it was fantastic and i will definitely buy it on DVD when it comes out (hopefully it will have a unrated extended release) . if there are any Hollywood higher-ups out there reading any of these reviews , make these type of movies rated ""R"" , make a remake of the original ""Exorcist"" , and i cannot wait to see the remake of ""Evil Dead"" . to everyone out there , if you want to see a movie that will scare the pants off ya ( especially the demonic parts on Emily ) i urge you to see this movie . After reading some of the negative reviews , people COME ON !!!! this is not a slash em up gore flick , it deals with the supernatural . sure the story may be alittle choppy at times , but if they had to explain everything , this would be over a 4 hour movie . the HORROR in this movie is the fact that it is based on a true story . the thought that real stuff like could happen . demonic attacks , possission , witching hour(3am) , and hauntings . all this could happen . thats the horror in this film !! if your looking for a gore movie , this is not it. like i said , if you liked the supernatural classics like ""the exorcist"" or ""evil dead "" please see this movie . the things emily does durring the possission will leave disturbing thoughts in you mind such as old samara did in ""the ring"" that is all i will say .",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
479,Yesman567,"Very well done, refreshing change in the genre",9,12 September 2005,"With so many just plain bad horror movies coming out lately (The Cave, White Noise, The Grudge), and the lack of any good entertainment in the genre, it was a breath of fresh air to finally see a good, possibly great ""horror"" movie after so long. Without resorting to cheap scares, bumps in the night, and corny catchphrases, Emily Rose was able to rise above the rest of the horror crowd of the past few years and stands as a must-see for any fan of the genre.Be warned, though- If you're a fan of constant action, blazing story, and nonstop scares, this movie may not be for you. The general pace of the movie falls along the lines of Silence of the Lambs, at least as I remember it; There are sometimes long breaks between the horror elements in the film, but this doesn't keep it from being an interesting and intensely fear-inducing experience. In my opinion, this pace actually contributed to the movie's entertaining nature. The viewer wasn't spoiled on scares within the first 10 minutes, and the end of the movie was just as tense as the first scenes. So, if you're a fan of cheap ""jump out of your seat"" scares, this film may not offer as much to you as it did to me personally, but is most likely still worth your 2 hours.Overall, I feel that this film is one of the strongest in the realm of horror in the past 3 years. Possession has always been something that bridges the gap of what is scary in many people between different cultures and backgrounds, and this film has taken advantage of that fact perfectly, following in and improving on the footsteps of The Exorcist. I would highly recommend this film to any horror junkie like myself, and even if you're not one, give it a try anyway. It's sure to be entertaining, at the least.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

But I was wrong It was a very good movie and I wounld'nt mind seeing it a second time. No long drawn out story it gets straight to the point and never a dull moment. Not overly focused on horror but has a good plot, but definitely scary (creepy).Excellent for a person who studies the mental health field or believers in the Christian faith or both.I really began to study the background of the movie when I got home because it is based on a true story .

482,navy_mr_goodbar,5 out of 5,9,12 September 2005,"First off, the trailer IS misleading. I originally found out about the misleadings before I went to go see it, so I knew ahead of time it would not be like the trailer intended it to be.In the end, I gave this movie a 5 out of 5. If it were on a 10-scale rating, it would be a little under a 9, but I found it good enough to give it a 5 in the 5-scale rating.Pros: {{Great story line.}} If you're into the story of the movie, this is a good one to see. As long as you get into it, you'll be able to immerse yourself into the movie experience and have a true feeling for the story. -- {{Great acting.}} I found the performance of Jennifer Carpenter (Emily Rose) in the mind-boggling contortions to be an awesome addition to the film. It truly made me believe she was stuck in those positions w/o will. -- {{True story to movie similarities.}} If you read the true story, they made it a lot like the real-life story. From her seeing demonic images to her eating spiders and speaking in foreign tongues, I found it quite life-like to the real-life story.Cons: {{Trailer misleading.}} Like stated before, the trailer is misleading. You're expecting to go and see a SCARY movie, but in the end you feel a bit disappointed because it's more creepy than it is scary and, if anything, only makes you feel scared sleeping by yourself at night. -- {{Lots of conversation.}} If you get bored easily of continuous talk and debate, this movie is probably not meant for you. This movie is more of a court discussion than anything else which will leave people desiring less talk and more action/screams. -- {{Ending kind of ruins it.}} I'm not the only one on this, others agree that the ending kind of left you saying, ""Huh? That's it?"" You're kind of left with a feeling of incompleteness with the movie because it ends in a ""dull"" manner. Throughout the entire movie you have a feeling of doubt and what's going to happen next so you're in suspense. Then the ending hits leaving you wanting more. (If you see it, you'll understand my point of view exactly.)In the end I still gave it a 5 out of 5 simply because I'm the type of movie critic that loves a great story and doesn't mind too much talk.

483,fcleiser4,Standard horror movie that leaves one in a state of questioning,6,12 September 2005,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose""...I bought a ticket for this movie expecting to see a remake of ""The Exorcist"", but I was wrong. This should definitely be considered a horror movie, just not to a degree of ""The Exorcist"". This movie focuses more on leaving a cliffhanger at the end. The question, does Emily have epilepsy, or is she really possessed, goes through unanswered.There is virtually no suspense at all, something that caused me to give this movie an average score. Throughout the film, I could successfully predict what would happen, and that isn't something good in a horror movie. I must admit though, there were a few scenes that caused me to ""jump"" which, in my belief, was the goal. These scenes range from subtle sound effects to cinematic visual effects. There is one scene in particular, in which we (the audience) see things from Emily's perspective, and realize just how warped her mind has become.The characters are developed, but not enough. The acting is good, especially from Jennifer Carpenter, the woman playing Emily Rose. She is screaming most of the time, but her facial expression can be clearly seen and understood.Overall, this is an above average horror film, but it is not one of the better movies of it's genre. I was tempted to rate lower, but this movie did make me think. The one question in the movie is never answered, leaving viewers to fend for themselves. However, a thousand more questions come to mind as well. Questions that aren't meant to be answered. Life...Death...Purpose...so many questions that need answers, and yet we have so little time to search...",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
484,CosmicCharlie,Worth Watching,7,9 September 2005,"This is an interesting film. While it's not terribly frightening, the film's juxtaposition of court room drama, and the exorcism scenes are intriguing. I found it to be less of your stereotypical demonic possession movie (ie: The Exorcist), and more of a film that leaves you pondering the possibilities and questioning our more modern perspectives and scientific rationales for things that sometimes can't be adequately explained through these means. The fact that it's based on the reported possession of Anneliese Michel (circa 1970, Germany) does make the film more unnerving. The actor's performances, while not exceptional, are at least engaging. The special effects are rather limited, but well done.

485,spooktacularfx,"The Exorcism of Emily ""BLOWS""",4,9 September 2005,"I had just got back from watching this movie, and quite frankly it wasn't scary at all....not the least bit to my knowledge. It was profoundly done with a ""Law and Order"" style.This movie was more a courtroom drama than a horror, and could find itself right up on the shelf at the video store along with movies like ""A Few Good Men"".Now about the special effects: What special effects???? I have seen more special effects in a black and white cartoon than in this movie. In my opinion this movie deserved more effects (i.e. makeup, gore, blood, etc.) It certainly lacked the effect ""The Excorist"" contained on showing shear terror through the eyes of a witness to a real-life exorcism in progress.The wrap-up: If you are in your late 30's or 40's and into t.v. shows like ""Law and Order"", or even ""CSI"" you'll find this movie to be right up your alley.

But it was mostly just courtroom justice and manila folders. Yay for manila folders. But the courtroom scenes did provide a break from the horror and such. Some of the scenes with Emily Rose were either horribly acted or overacted. But still...she's mostly a crazy possessed girl. We don't have to see her acting.I doubt it was actually based on a real event. Most movie directors add that for a scary effect. I saw Amityville Horror and Texas Chainsaw Massarce. Both are urban legends and both are claimed to be 'based of true stories'.This movie uses both traditional science and untraditional science to explain the phenomenon of 'possesion'. One side explains it by saying she was epileptic and had psychosis. Another tries to say she was actually possessed. By SIZ demons. Including Satan. Someone must be creative. But this was a good movie seeing as we know so little about Satan and god. BLAHSCARY.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
487,asurma,"Great film, not horror",10,9 September 2005,"I thought the movie was outstanding: story, acting (with one exception), and script. The one exception being when the professor was on the stand during the trial... she was a bit over the top with her body language while speaking (I think she was trying to hard to act Indian).With that being said, a lot of people did not enjoy the film. The couple right of me actually walked out 30 minutes prior to the movie ending, and they weren't the only ones I seen leave early. The comments I heard from others, after the movie was over and we were all walking to the theatre exits, were: ""I can't believe I paid to see this"" and, ""This was such a waste of my time."" They obviously did not enjoy the film and I believe I know why.This is not a horror film. It's based on a true story, and presented in a believable manner. Nothing is done in an over-the-top manner. You will not jump out of your seat in fear, unless you are a 13 year old child -- and there were many in the theatre. And, yes, they did jump/scream many times (including once when a cat hissed). Half of the movie is flashbacks, and the other half is courtroom drama (ala The Practice).I went into the theatre expecting just such a movie and enjoyed it greatly. The vast majority of people (children) who saw it were expecting a horror movie (like maybe The Grudge) and felt let down. Those are the ones who did not enjoy it.I, for one, usually don't go to see horror movies. Movies I enjoyed in the past were Sixth Sense, Fight Club, Sin City -- just to name a few.I think it's unfortunate that the movie trailers do portray it to be a horror movie since that is bound to disappoint viewers.Again, it's a great movie if you think you would enjoy a drama based on a true story with a hint of the supernatural.

It is believable and overall a good movie. It's not FANTASTIC but it's definitely worth seeing. It's interesting and shows the medical, scientific, and religious sides of exorcisms. I would recommend it to all regardless of their religious standing. The Exorcism of Emily Rose starts out with a court case against a young girl who was allegedly possessed by the devil. It's very interesting because the writers decided to throw in all angles of exorcism.

I am a paranormal investigator and researcher and I do believe that possession from so-called black entities we call 'demons' do exist and our own psychics have confirmed this and I have seen them myself with my own eyes in places we investigate. It can be very scary when this happens. You have to know the right way to react to such things and not freak out. There are such a thing as ghosts and the demons that control them sometimes. I will let everyone have their own opinion and belief on this topic. This is what this movie strives to do - prove that there is the possibility that strange unknown dark forces do exist in the physical world we live in. We mostly are ignorant to things such as this and ghosts in general even though this kind of stuff predates history itself. If I had directed this movie, I would have done it somewhat differently and would have focused more on the actual torment this girl went through during her possession that led to her actual death. Unfortunately, this would have been compared to ""The Exorcist"" even though it is an entirely different story altogether. This movie by the way was also was very loosely based on what actually happened to a girl that was possessed in this manner and the trial that took place as a result of her death.

However the exorcism of Emily rose was very very creepy and very compelling. I could not imagine how much work and effort was put into this film. I am Catholic, which probably affected me even more-so than agnostics or any other ""religion"" for that matter. the movie made me look at both point of views. and even caused me to question my beliefs, however i believe that the religious perspective ( although the scientific and medical point of view was very very persuasive ) was much stronger and always will be. The Exorcism of Emily rose was much more than just Demonic possession and Exorcisms... it was a cross between Law and Order ( only 10 X better ) and the exorcist, possibly Constantine.

The previews are misleading in the sense that the build the movie up to be a actual horror movie. Being a big horror movie fan, i went into this film thinking it might be at least worth my time, possibly evoking the creativity of the original Exorcist movie (also based on a ""true"" story), which i knew would be too good to be true. Instead this film in actuality is an equivalent to watching a law & order episode with a very heavy Christian propaganda twist. Granted a lot of horror movies seem to have this theme, but to reiterate, this is not in the slightest a horror movie (all the ""horror"" parts are shown in the preview). Nor was the movie even interesting. The story was easily figured out in the first few minutes. Typical unbeliever turns believer, believer question faiths; hard to manipulate this formula. Personally i am getting sick of all the propaganda movies coming out, be it horror or typical military hero-style recruitment films. This movie is not a movie to take seriously or get a good laugh at, just an overall waste of time. WHERE ARE THE REAL CREATIVE PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE WORLD? PLEASE, SOMEONE GIVE THEM MONEY TO MAKE A FILM! If you want to see some good horror films, i would like to recommend Suspiria (or anything by Dario Argento 70's movies), Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Exorcist, The Brood, etc. i even liked the Dawn Of The Dead remake.

Emily Rose is infinitely less over the top than the Exorcist which actually works to its advantage as it tries to convince it's audience that the story being presented is, in fact, very possibly true.The beginning of the film sets you up for a decent horror flick with some great atmosphere that descends into cheap scare tactics through most of it's duration. There are some great visuals and genuine chills sprinkled throughout the film, but too many walking around in the dark waiting for the surprise and well placed loud sound effect 3 times louder than everything else on the soundtrack. Seriously, even ""The Ring"" didn't sink to that level as often as this flick.The scares or broken up by courtroom scenes which are not done particularly well or acted particularly well, but serve their purpose to advance the plot and raise questions about the story's authenticity which makes them interesting enough. Half of the movie feels like a decent horror movie, while the other half feels like a bad courtroom drama, and this is where ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" falters the most in my opinion. It almost feels like the movie cannot decide what genre it wants to be, and not in the genre-bending good way.Now for something positive... the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. Most of my complaints apply to the earlier portion of the film. As the movie builds to a climax it does, in fact, start to get better and better. The actual climax in the form of the exorcism scene is actually very well done and gets many extra points in my book for not cheaply ripping off ""The Exorcist"". After this climax is a resolution that lasts a little too long, but doesn't hurt the movie as much as about 10 other things I've already mentioned.My verdict: Rental Don't expect too much out of this movie or you'll be very disappointed, expect a cheaply made B-horror movie and you might be pleasantly surprised. Very good production values, better than most other recent horror movies, a good story to tell make ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" enjoyable, but mediocre at best.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
498,wicket812001,A good film with a solid purpose!,8,12 September 2005,"Reading some of the previous reviews listed on this website I felt compelled to leave my own review of this film as a retort to some inaccurate comments. I saw this movie on opening weekend, and thought the film made strong efforts to get its story through to the viewer. This is not by any means just a typical horror film. Several of the previous reviews listed indicated disappointment based on the fact that their was not a ton of blood and gore present, and in the end the evil villain does not die some horrible death, while still allowing room for a cheesy sequel. This film stays true to the real premise of the Emily Rose story and the intention of the film, which is to allow the viewer to decide was Emily truly possessed or just another individual suffering from a psychological disorder. Much of the film does take place in a court room, and depicts some pretty intense moments that were portrayed very well by the actors. The remainder of the movie consists of flashbacks as to the actual witnessed occurrences of Emily Rose's possession, which contain some pretty eerie scenes. I would still say that many of the people in the theater were truly scared, and in fact several couples got up and left before the end of the movie. Even though this film possessed less gore and blood it is still frightening in the same sense that ""The Exorcist"" scared so many people over twenty years ago, and that is that people are much more truly frightened over what they believe may actually happen, and not just another slasher film. I feel that is in this sense that the plot to this movie goes deeper than just visual imagery and may effect viewers on other levels, especially those with a high regard toward their own religious beliefs. I would highly recommend this film to anyone not going to see just the most recent horror film release, but to anyone who might be a bit more interested in what really happened to Emily Rose!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
499,blazing64,This is a must see movie!!!,10,12 September 2005,"Yes,I am along with the previous commenter...This movie is SCARY!! Again, because it is a true story ..in fact, i was still freaked when i got home, and slept with the lights on. More importantly, though, the reason i give the film a ""10"" of ""10"" rating, is due to the story of the inflicted girl, and the pure impact it had on me. If it was just a ""scary movie"", i would not have givin it such a high rating.I am not an easy person to please when it comes to movies. So take my word for it when i say: THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!!

I thought that at the end of the movie, when they were doing updates, it said the movie was based of The Life and Death of Emily Rose. But i can't find it anywhere. Does anyone know where I can get the book or the title or it? I can't find any info on Emily Rose and I would like to read up on her. Where anyone believes the story or not something happen to her.

501,Doctoyota,Big Let Down,1,13 September 2005,"It was painful to sit through because the commercial hyped the film as scary. Anything remotely scary was so spread out through the movie it was impossible to create any tension or ""spookiness."" Just when you thought things were getting underway the movie went back to the courtroom. The commercial was definitely scarier than the movie! They were obviously trying to run off of the coattails of the Exorcist. I don't remember seeing a single courtroom scene in the previews. It's extremely disappointing when you go to a movie expecting to be entertained and then find out the movie is a courtroom drama! There was a lot of groaning and looking at watches in the theater. I had huge expectations for this movie. I can't help but feel mislead. Not many satisfied people leaving the theater!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

When I went to see ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" I was horribly disappointed. I was expecting to at least jump out of my seat once or twice, but sadly, that didn't happen. The attempt to scare movie go'rs was sub-par at best. The fact that the movie wasn't even centered around Emily Rose was very disappointing. This was more of a law movie then anything else. Hurray for the depressing attorney... thats not what I came to see. I wasn't there to hear about the trial, I wanted to be scared, and lets face it, court rooms aren't exactly frightening. I'd say that the directors get an ""A"" for effort but... they don't. This movie did not provide any chills or scares. Definitely not worth the money I paid to see it.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
503,CatholicPriest,Good But Confusing,7,13 September 2005,"As a Catholic Priest I was VERY interested in this movie! I have never done an exorcism but I know several priests who have. There are lots of good books & articles on real exorcisms available today & I wish somebody would make a film which reflects the successful outcome of most exorcisms. The case of Annelise Michel (Emily Rose) in Germany in 1976 is one of the saddest cases in the past 2000 years. In addition to having severe medical disorders & possibly being tormented by a dark spiritual force, the young girl also starved herself to death ... & her parents & 2 priests allowed her to do so! The film is really about 2 separate but related true stories: 1)Emily's ""possession"" by a demon 2)Emily's tragic death by self-starvation. The courtroom scenes do a pretty good job of explaining the differences between medical/psychological disorders & demonic possession. The film does NOT explain why Emily's parents & priests did not get her medical help as soon as she stopped eating. The film implies that this tragic neglect was part of the official Exorcism Rite of the Catholic Church. NO WAY! When priests perform an exorcism (a priest is NEVER allowed to perform an exorcism alone) there is usually a doctor or nurse present who monitors the medical condition of the victim/patient. Some exorcisms are even done in hospitals. Allowing someone to starve herself to death is NOT part of the Rite of Exorcism! It is also an inhumane act of negligence! For an accurate description & text of the Rite of Exorcism, Google-search ""Rite of Exorcism"" & read for yourself. The movie did make my heart beat a little faster for a few minutes & it made me think ... two things which make a good movie. But I hope people are intelligent enough to realize that most exorcisms have a ""happy ending"" ... the case of Emily Rose is a rare & very sad exception.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
504,ska345,Better than you thought,8,14 September 2005,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" starts out on a small farm in the middle of winter, when a medical examiner drops by the Rose family farm to declare whether or not a death was accidental. The audience will soon discover that a family member has passed away and the priest who has been watching over her for the past few months is going to jail for neglectful homicide. The family's oldest daughter, Emily played by Jennifer Carpenter, had just started college on a full scholarship and becomes possessed late one night. While the doctors at school diagnosed Emily with epilepsy and psychosis to explain away her violent seizures and visions, she firmly believes that she has been possessed and soon returns home to her Catholic family, and to be under the watchful eye of the family priest played by Tom Wilkinson. After an unsuccessful exorcism at the end of October, she passes away. The prosecutor in this movie pushes the case in the direction that their family is superstitious and the guidance from the priest Father Moore is what eventually killed Emily. This movie follows the trial of the priest who is not interested in proving his innocence, but to tell the story of Emily Rose, and is told mostly through flashbacks. Most people are expecting heads spinning, pea soup being projectile vomited everywhere, basically an ""Exorcist"" rip-off, that is not the intent of this movie. While a lot of the movie focuses around the court room, it's not the kind we're used to seeing on television; and this is to its disadvantage as the trial is actually quite boring. The intent of this movie is not to completely scare the audience, but to open the minds of the individual to the idea that there is a separate spirit world. The performance by Jennifer Carpenter is electrifying; while her vocal talents may not have been completely her own in this movie her seizures and facial distortions were enough to chill the blood of any skeptical movie goer but the film does more to provoke thought and discussion that to simply frighten.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
505,gmfbear1,Not So much a Horror picture as a Morality Play,8,15 September 2005,"Having been hooked on ""True Life"" horror stories (The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, etc), and other stories that raise spirituality questions, I thought that ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was a very well done movie. There was no Hollywood ""Gore and Guts"" effects, no big blood baths, no over-the-top special effects. What it did was tell a story and make you actually think, rather than sit and get hit in the face with stage blood. Very well told, very fair to the Courts and the State, very fair to the Catholic Church (having been raised Catholic I am always looking for Catholic-bashing), and very fair to the character and her family. We need more true life spirituality stories like this as a choice for movie goers.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
506,abonakis,A very unique horror film...,9,16 September 2005,"This film was provoking, stimulating, and most of all...disturbing!! It also should have been rated R because I, as an adult, left the theater feeling haunted. The images from the movie stayed with me since then. I've seen a lot of scary movies, but I think this one left its mark. It leaves the audience with lots of questions to debate with their peers following the movie. What was brilliant about ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is that the supernatural realm is almost enforced into the minds of the audience. It asks the question: ""How far can science go in the explanation of possession?"" It is mind-boggling and very ere. In this film, science clashes with supernatural and leaves the audience with a piercing analysis. A must-see flick!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Excellent screen characters and wonderful flashback sequences - one of the best horror flicks I've seen in years.

509,a_det1017,"Very, very good",10,17 September 2005,"I am a horror movie fanatic, but I was still really scared to go see this movie. Its told by Father Moore, after he is arrested for negligent homicide. Some of the images on the screen are very disturbing, but it's not your typical scary movie. I would place it under thriller, or drama, because its very suspenseful, and thrilling. It is told in flashbacks of what happened to Emily Rose, before she died, in court. Erin Bruner, Father Moore's attorney, at first is just out to prove that Father Moore is innocent, but then her story totally changes into something unbelievable; but believable at the same time. After listening to Father Moore tell Emily's story, she begins to think that Emily didn't have epilepsy, but was possessed by demonic forces. Even I was scared for a few nights, just thinking about the possibilities. But overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend that you (and of course someone else to comfort you) go to see this movie, if you can handle such things. The images on the screen, and sounds are very disturbing, so think about how much you can handle before you see it. If you think you can, go see it now!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

It would have made a great documentary, and I definitely want to read the book. Emily herself, played by Jennifer Carpenter, was fantastic in all of her contortions and writhings. The courtroom debate (and subsequent images) of the possible causes of her condition make the film feel like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Book in which you are shown all of the possible outcomes at once. The only thrills in this movie are cheap ones, and the courtroom scenes are redundant. If the producers were attempting to give an objective observation, they succeeded. If they were trying to be entertaining, they failed. Next weekend I'll stay home and watch a cable special instead.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

Although this movie was made to be scary, I also think this movie was made to make people think. To intrigue them...perhaps question their own beliefs. It isn't preachy at all, but it does show an assorted points of view. When they are doing the actual exorcism, it gave me the chills. It was very disturbing. That was my favorite part! I think they portrayed a person that is possessed very well! It seemed very realistic. I have heard it is based on a true story. I don't know how much of it is true, but the fact that this young women was actually possessed by demons is amazing. I can't imagine the agony she had to go through.

The priest kept asking who was in Emily over and over. The demons got mad and gave a name of who lives within. Over all the movie wasn't that bad. The court was a little boring. It had it's scary parts. The movie was OK to me and I would see it again when I have the time. I would say if you we're thinking of going to see the move, go and see it.

In fact, the exorcism was a very small part of the movie(although was done with a lot of intensity). I enjoyed the ""playing with your mind"" horror like movies use to be. I clutched my bag of popcorn so tight in anticipation. This is the first movie I went to in theatres since the original XXX, and I was not disappointed! If you are into blood and guts horror, then this isn't for you. If you like being scared by old fashioned mind games, then this is right up your alley.

That said, I saw this movie to see the treatment of exorcism in a court room drama.That's what Emily Rose is, a court room drama, filled with lawyer politics, over dramatically questioning witnesses, and a lot of ""Objection"" premise...blah...blah...blah. But that's what I liked about it. It wasn't a horror movie, though some images were startling, but mostly chilling. It wasn't really a thriller, though you sometime feel chills. It was an honest look at the nature of belief; a look at the question, what is real or not; more acutely, if enough people believe in something, does that make it real? Is the sincerity of belief reason to excuse mistakes, if indeed a mistake is made? This movie is a fascinating look into the simulacra; what is the difference between the signified and the signifier? To the point, is demon possession really psychosis, or is what we call psychosis possession? If you're looking for a horror/thriller, you may be disappointed.

This had a good story line and strong points. I felt like something was missing though. Timing seemed a little off through the trial and the Emily Rose scenes.Because I enjoy watching non-fictional films this movie attracted me.I suppose I was attracted to this movie because like we learned in class, humans love to know the truth and seek the facts.

I did think this movie was well worth the money, but it would have been much better if I could have seen the parts that I found the scariest a little better.It did make me question the whole possession theory since it was supposedly based on a true story, and I think I may read up more on the subject.

I saw ""The Exorcist"" when I was 14 and it scared the hell out of me. When I watch it today as an adult...It is almost laughable. Emily Rose was not that way at all. Emily Rose was a person you didn't learn about personally. You just learned about what happened to her and the priest that was on trial for ""neglecting"" her, and the effect it had on the lawyer defending him. The Bible tells us that Jesus exorcised demons from people in his day. I, for one would think that he would have known if it were demons or a psychiatric illness.

The Exorcism of Emily Rose is ostensibly based on the story of Anneliese Michel, a German college student who believed she was possessed by multiple demons, including Lucifer, Nero, Judas Iscariot, and Adolf Hitler. The film is inspired by true events that chronicle the tale of the priest accused of negligence resulting in the death of a young girl believed to be possessed. To top up to the chilling facts, just recently, a Romanian priest currently stands accused of the same crime. Just last month, a 23-year old nun died during an exorcism ritual.

526,janinamousley,"A story well told, leaving much 'food for thought'.",10,18 November 2005,"If one is a Christian, one cannot deny the existence of Satan. During Christ's own earthly ministry, 2,000 years ago, He drove out demons from those possessed by them and gave His authority to His Apostles to do the same. This same ministry has been passed on to their successors through the Catholic Church. We Catholics believe that Jesus Christ is true God, as well as true Man, and He did not lie about Satan or trivialize his influence. Nothing Jesus Christ did or instructed His Apostles to do was irrelevant or unimportant. So it is no surprise that the priest in the film treats demonic possession very seriously, discerns it carefully, and then performs the rite of exorcism, as do other priests in the Catholic Church, who have been given this authority. Though this action is in response to Christ's command, it is not an easy thing for anyone involved. The film shows the seriousness of the matter, the terror experienced by the person possessed, the natural fear and concern of the priest, the family and any other witnesses. One is asked to judge for oneself whether such a thing really occurred or does occur, as we listen to the eyewitnesses, and like the jury called in the court we cannot help but consider whether the priest was negligent and the young woman misdiagnosed. We are all faced with the question.... whether this really happened. Yet we are told that this is a true story, and it is very simply, but well told. If we believe it, it confirms that even in our modern times, Jesus Christ's ministry of exorcism is needed and available to us in 2005 and His love for us, and for Emily, transcends what appears to be human defeat.

527,kikolom,A movie that is at the level of the topic with all its depth and subtleties,9,22 November 2005,"I think this is a great movie, for it has been able to deal with something that challenges being put into film. The film presents plainly the main aspects that concern a possession: the relationship of darkness and evil. The spectator realizes that is is not a sort of dark danger, but evil itself, not something that scares but that removes something ""inside"". The movie is deep because (as the story itself probably was) stays away from sentimentalism or sensationalism, just lets the story find its own way. It is amazing how well the real depth of the story is gradually presented, not all at once from the beginning, for it is the same thing in reality, culminating in the difficult question of the (christian) mystery of evil: why did it happen to that girl?

528,madison80,Oh Lord Give Me Strength,3,1 December 2005,"Oh for heaven Sake! I normally love movies like this but not this one. I feel like it went on for ever, the Titanic took less time to sink!! I believe that its just another of those ""Amity Ville"" movies again. Where they say its true story but yet again Hollywood puts fiction over the facts. The trailer looked great, spooky, creepy and built the movie up showing it to be tense and evil. But I should of just watched the trailer again as I really feel that it was such a let down. This movie is like a lot of them, too much hype for an average flick!!! I really felt disappointed when I left the cinema. But maybe that's just me, and the rest of the world loved it!!

529,RussKaos,Good but not the right one...,6,25 November 2005,Well this film was pretty good and there's no denying that BUT I was expecting to see a lot more of Emily Rose. Instead we had endless courtroom scenes which got a little tiresome after a while.The film was good in the sense that it showed you what went on and what was happening in the present day. Whilst watching the film I had goosebumps throughout most of it and although it was overly scary there were parts that made me jump and that didn't look pretty. I mean there wasn't any blood but if you've seen the trailers you'll know what I mean.I have given this film 6 out of 10 just because I think it needed more work done to it. For once I managed to follow the story where as I normally get lost. This could be a good thing but I like a film to really confuse me and mess with my head. This did a little but not enough.I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it to go and check it out so that you can decide for yourself if you like it or not.Russ,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
530,heff1999,Faith Vs Science,1,2 December 2005,"This isn't so much a 'horror' movie as a courtroom drama about religious faith and the part it can play in society today. The story of Emily Rose and the subsequent 'exorcism' is told in flashback as a catholic priest is on trial for Emily's death.Having removed Emily's medication to control her alleged epilepsy (which was'nt giving any relief anyway) the priest convinces Emily to concentrate instead on 'Faith' to rid her of the six demons that now periodically control her body.There is nothing new in this movie. As a previous commentator noted, if you have seen the trailers then you have pretty much seen the best bits. Melting eyes, crab contortions and guttural voices.Because the story (predictable as it is) revolves around the court case and we only get glimpses of what actually occurred, I found myself unable to empathise with Emily and her plight. Like I say this is all about religion and a possible role for it in todays modern world.I gave this a 1 rating. It's as poor a movie as I have ever seen, but of course, you may like it. My best advice is ""don't bother"" but I'm sure those of you who like this sort of thing will :D For those of you who enjoyed this movie, maybe you could tell me why? What has it got that the original and far superior ""Exorcist"" doesn't have?",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
531,zhasius,Movie Review,9,4 December 2005,"""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is a thriller film set in a distant small village which has its own community and is not under any town influence. A lawyer takes on a negligent homicide case involving a priest who performed an exorcism on a young girl. Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson play the title role and are involved in all the spirit fights because only they dare to go against nature and prove that demons which killed Emily Rose really exist. The story starts after police officer finds the death body of a young girl and medicine expert stats that her death might not be natural. Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) pleads the case in a court and tries to prove that Father Moore (Tom Wilkinson) is innocent. The story consists of short narrations of witnesses. Each of them tells a part of the matter and eventually Father Moore finishes the entire story by showing a dicta phone with recorded process of exorcism and a letter of Emily itself in which she writes about demons inside her. However priest is convicted but by attester recommendation his punishment was the time he already spent in jail during trial process. Even though Father Moore is faced to be guilty viewer sees that he in not. Although the film last almost 2 hours and is rather long, the script is exciting, involving and full of thrilling scenes. The acting is excellent and very realistic, especially Jennifer Carpenter as the demonic Emily Rose and of course, Father Moore is perfectly representing the church and fighting for its correctness. The story will make spectator to tremble from the very firs accords of music until the last mien of Emily Rose. ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" was the most popular film of the weekend of its first-night in Lithuania. It is well worth seeing, as it very terrifying movie. Moreover, as it is based on the true story of Anneliese Michel, a young German woman who suffered the same fate as the fictional Emily Rose in the 1970s forces viewer to consider this movie with even bigger solidity. I really recommend you to watch this film as it had a big influence on me and changed my opinion about demonic forces and underworld. Do not miss it, it will change the way you think about these thing also.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
532,tony-pearshouse-1,Good but not scary enough,7,13 December 2005,"I was pleased that there weren't many computer animations and the more obvious ones didn't really add to the film. Too many horror films rely on computer-generated scary bits which often do not scare at all. There's a fair amount of tension and the courtroom drama adds to the film. However, compared to The Exorcist this film just falls a bit short, even though it is much longer. The exorcism is too short and I feel that more could have been done during it. The story is supposed to be true. I would have preferred a bit less truth and a bit more fright. Still, I enjoyed the film and would recommend it to those who like religious horror films.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
533,sokagra,Great movie,10,19 December 2005,"Absolutely Excellent! Probably the best op the ""Exorcism"" film until now! Give it some time in the start of the movie. It gets very exiting and spooky. You can pick a side you believe in. The spirit of the movie makes you think... You will think that if you believe in this kind of things, it could happen to everyone of us. You come to care about the young girl, Emily and you get a close relationship with the priest and Emily Rose and Erin Bruiner. This store makes you think if there is more from earth to sky. It is very beautiful done and the actors are great. The film ends like it should, but not as expected in my opinion. 3 AM is now a spooky time for me :) - Whait and see ;)See it!!!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
534,blacklightvortex,Gorgeous but Boring,1,28 December 2005,"I kept waiting for it to get scary. I thought perhaps I selected the unscary option on the menu. No such luck. Not frightening at all - just boring. Like twiddling your thumbs boring. We've seen the exorcism stuff before and the story moved like a catholic mass on a Tuesday morning. However, every frame of this movie is a work of pure visual art - the director and his team had a master's eye no doubt and the sound design is superb. For those reasons I'll keep my ""unrated version"" DVD but that's it. Scary? No.With the director's commentary enabled, the director recalls some advice from Clint Eastwood where too much ""analysis is paralysis"". This movie turned out to be a quadriplegic. The director should have kept those words in mind while making the movie instead of recalling it for the commentary.Beautiful to look at but nearly impossible to sit through without laughing at how 'serious' it's supposed to be.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
535,emjcbrown,The Exorcism of Emily Rose,9,1 January 2006,"I thought this was an excellent and gripping, movie that was extremely well made. It captured the meaning of the story and really put forward the important aspects. It involves the audience in a personal way and as the trial progresses we learn more about Emily Rose. I personally hadn't seen the first movie and was pleasantly surprised at how I enjoyed it. I was of course sinking in my seat and blocking my ears as the sounds affects and light affects were superb but the breaks in intensity when flicking back to the court room made the movie that much more interesting, understandable, and realistic. One thing I would like to add on a personal note. The locket which the lawyer found had the initials ecb which are my initials and I would very much like to know where I could get one similar. If anyone can help please let me know! I think it was an excellent movie",The Exorcism of Emily Rose

537,hazeleyes2010,Creepy...,7,15 January 2006,"This Movie was really interesting...it really gave me chills. I was expecting it to be really gory, and it wasn't so much that type of scary as it was just creepy, and the really creepy parts I wasn't really expecting. They'll just jump out at you. I liked some of this movie...I really get into the scary ones ya know, and this one made me jump out of my seat and grab onto the nearest arm I could, but other times it was just confusing, even in the very first scene,I didn't know what was going on. It gets better though as the movie goes on, and scarier...I won't reveal the scariest scene! Overall, it was a somewhat confusing yet very interesting movie to watch...have someone there with you though! We had to take my friend home after watching it, and he was left there in an empty house, which is not something I would think the average person could handle after watching a movie like that!",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
538,rajumfm,good movie not just sticking to scary scenes,10,22 January 2006,The movie revolved around the faith and beliefs ...the lawyer who was antagonist ..or rather not sure of what she is was able to help the priest because she saw the genuineness in his belief..Apart from that the court room scenes were taken very well..the unexpected scenes were the Emily will not be found on the bed and his boy friend sees her on the floor in a pose which was kind of similair to epiliptic pose but has got the unusual element which really sent shivers in spinei think the scene where the doctor misses the testimony in the court and dies in an accident was also unexpected.. the really touching and punch in the movie was the last court room scene where the priest reads the letter of the Emily reminds every one irrespective of the religions and faiths sometimes got to choose the painful way to get the our true goal and help others on the way..,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
539,imthebomb,You want morality? Read Kant!,5,27 January 2006,"A lot of people read too much into ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", praising its approach to issues such as professional ethics and the legal/spiritual relationship. In fact, as the movie goes on it became clear to me that it's not quite as deep or insightful as it tries to be. Any such moral or theological issues were represented with such superficiality and dubious legal processes that no real lessons are taught, and no deep issues even half-way posed. The awkward contrast of religious themes within a legal system is not explored, explained or even justified in any depth. Thus the courtroom aspect of the movie is not so much a debate, but a repetitious presentation of two entirely different value systems which (for good reason) are generally kept separate in any real-life court of law. As a result I was left dissatisfied with the justification of the legal conclusion (or lack thereof).Similarly, the characterisation is more contrivance than brilliance. Both Ethan Thomas (Scott) and Erin Bruner (Linney) are characterised as aggressive, quick-thinking lawyers, supposedly setting the courtroom scene as an intriguing intellectual battle-ground. There is enough legalese, quick retorts and quasi-intellectual rhetoric to give the superficial illusion of an engaging legal process, but in truth the court proceedings become legally laughable and slightly predictable. Relatively strong performances by Tom Wilkinson (Father Moore) and Laura Linney (Erin Bruner) ensured that the courtroom scenes were at least somewhat interesting, despite the aforementioned script problems.Ironically, the strongest feature of this film is the part which many of its biggest fans wish not to mention. It's horror scenes use simple techniques effectively to create a palpable air of foreboding in every flash-back scene from about 20 minutes onwards. Jennifer Carpenter complements this with an intense performance as the possessed Emily Rose. Not being a particularly seasoned or avid horror fan, I found the regular flashbacks a bit heavy for my taste, but nevertheless I think they were well done, and scared me in a way that few other movies could do.Am I the only one who believes that a court-room drama should consist of more than just legalese and quasi-intellectual courtroom rhetoric, and should actually have a strong legal basis? I'm not sure how loosely this film was based on the 'true' story it supposedly represents, but I'm quite sure that the real-life trial would not have been much like this at all.You want ethics? Read Immanuel Kant. You want theology? Read Paul Davies.If you want a mildly interesting yet contrived courtroom drama with surprisingly strong horror scenes, then watch this.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
540,PGraham002,Fine Film,10,28 January 2006,"A great film. From beginning to end, and Carpenters performance as Emily was tremendous. I thought all the actors and actresses were great in their parts, apart from the Priest , Wilkinson. Even though I am English, I could not understand why an Englishman was chosen for the part. He put on a fake accent, a sort of American one, and it was not convincing. But I was mesmerised by 'Emily's' performance, especially the scene in the barn. Would watch it again and again. I have read the case of the German girl that the film was based on, and for once the Hollywood version sticks closely to it, although obviously based in the US and not in Germany. But what made it so good, was there was less of the flying objects used by other directors in 'excorsism films of the past, and relied on the personal possession.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
541,sandramae_21,"Yes, it frightens me but with a discerning will",8,1 February 2006,"The movie comprehensively presents the separation of the ""spiritual"" world to the real dimension, where we the living live. It leads us to a courthouse of supernatural beliefs that science or medicine could not explain. It accommodates the questions of whether there is indeed the existence of various perspective-both the darkness/evil and the Divine and that how can we save ourselves from being the victim of this ""other (dark) dimension""? In the movie, Emily Rose (beautifully and creatively played by Jennifer Carpenter) wrote a letter admitting that she met the Virgin Mother and explained to her the purpose of her sufferings-to let the people know and be aware of the existence of the demons, and that the people have to work for their Salvation with fear and trembling (in the end, this verse was embossed on Emily's epitaph). I have to admit that my acquiescence to the Virgin Mother is not that strong. I am a Catholic but other members of the family are not. They used to explicate the role of the Virgin Mother as a mere servant not deserving of too much accolade. And I was eroded to such thinking that praying a novena for her is not a part of my spiritual habit. Watching this film help me fathom the role of the Virgin Mother as (maybe) servant (indeed), a more merited servant and more than that She is still the Mother of Christ.I like the rebuttal defense of counselor Erin Bruner (incomparably acted by Linda Linney) where she stated, ""... I am a woman of doubt...Facts leave no space for possibilities...""In reality, we tend to believe on what the reason can explains to us logically and disregard the ""other supernatural"" possibilities. Our constitutions, justice system and even our personal disposition are all bounded on factual reasons.I like the movie. Yes, it frightens me but with a discerning will. The will to resist dark forces and embrace the known Divine. In the same way, it made me understand the spiritual dimension which reason can not explicate. That man is indeed a composition of a temporal body and of an immortal soul; that even we acknowledge the immediacy of this supernatural dimension or not, we are still bound to comprehend the philosophy behind it; that whether we are believers of a Supernatural Being or not, we are still a battlefield of goodness and evil.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
542,kustomdragon,Opinion of Exorcism of Emily Rose,1,14 February 2006,"This movie was not only horrible in all aspects of the movie, this movie was hard to follow, was not well made and wasn't scary in the least little bit.So in saying that the movie isn't even worth putting in your DVD player, and please don't waste the movie on renting it and most certainly don't waste ANY movie on buying this unless your a fanatic of horribly made non-fictional films with bad direction and producing, in that case get some popcorn and a pillow (you will need it, possibly have a pretty girl with you as well because you will need someone to talk to while the movie is playing.

545,lilem1236,it was amazing,9,23 March 2006,"This film was one of the best exorcism films I have ever seen. In my opinion it's not scary it's just one of those types of movies that will make you ask your self many questions. The scenes in this film are just incredible I give Jennifer Carpenter 2 thumbs up on this one. Though this movie does not follow the exact true story of Anneliese Michle it does give you a great idea of what really happened to her. Also it's a film that may make you wonder are demons really real? Was Emily Rose really possessed or was she in need of series medical treatment? I guess you will have to watch ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" movie and have your own opinion on that. My personal opinion this was a possessed and sickened girl that nobody really cared about and she was desperately in need of help. Maybe if Anneliese Michle was given the treatment of care she was in need of she would still be here to day",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
546,peterhall049,A poor film,1,25 March 2006,"The film ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" is blatant propaganda, all but unwatchable for its cringe-inducing transparency. Its first purpose is not to tell a story but is instead to persuade viewer that exorcism - and therefore the Devil and God - are real entities.The story centres on a courtroom, used as a vehicle to ""prove"" the case of the film makers. The courtroom drama is interposed with cuts of the ""posssesion"" which are designed to add verisimilitude to their case, but which I find disingenuous.The use of an ""anthropologist"" as a ""scientific"" witness to back their case yet further is appalling, especially when contrasted with the frailty of the medical evidence given in support of the prosecution (that is, in opposition to the film makers views).I concluded this film is really about ""science versus religion"", and that its maker believes such a debate exists to be won; a proposition that surely is most unwelcome.",The Exorcism of Emily Rose
547,murt-2,Great concept bad direction,7,26 March 2006,It is a shame that when seeing this film advertised it is constantly put in the 'not another one' category. Before watching the film I had in mind that this film would be a tacky imitation of 'The Exorcist.' However I was pleasantly surprised with the result and aesthetically this film is far superior to the Exorcist in my opinion. This film is not a scary movie rather a psychological thriller and whereas in 'The Exorcist'there is a lot of incoherence and disregard to the spirituality of the concept of Exorcism this film is very sensitive. The only regret I have about this film is the commercial way in which it is presented. The suburban lifestyle of the family and the personalities could have been more vividly depicted and in general there is no style in the direction of the film. For this reason we have an average view of the film even when some qualities show a lot of promise. The best character is by far the prosecutor whose hypocrisy is infuriating. The priest portrayal is fairly weak and his strength could have been better captured by the actor. In general I think this story could have been a great film if the resources/direction had been there.,The Exorcism of Emily Rose
