0,MartinHafer,heavy-handed and unnecessary,6,8 December 2005,"The original VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED (1960) was one of the most brilliant, spooky and ""best bang for the buck"" movies ever made. With a tiny budget, it managed to do so much. So, why remake this wonderful classic? Other than to make a fast buck without spending much effort, I can't see why. And, unfortunately, this does appear to be the reason why the film was made. Gone are the thrills and suspense. Instead of an eerie build-up, we have more gore and a movie that is a ""dumbed down"" version for people who insist on hi-tech films. In its place is a flat, pale imitation of the original. I don't know about you, but I find that in at least 80% of the cases, the original is better.So why does the film STILL get a 6? Well, with such a great plot it is almost impossible for the film to still be very watchable.Save your time and watch the original--it's often on Turner Classic Movies and it's available on DVD and video.",Village of the Damned
1,Leofwine_draca,Stupid remake is a career low for John Carpenter,2,27 November 2016,"An insipid, uninspired retread of the 1960 original. This film is typical of what happens when America churns out yet another remake of a classic film. The result is shallow, glossy, and totally dull. John Carpenter, who has made such brilliant films as HALLOWEEN and THE THING, obviously took the money and ran in this case, as the film contains none of his typical atmosphere or style. Instead it has a bland, TV movie like atmosphere. The chills in the first film from the spooky children are replaced instead by clumsy over-emphasis. Gone are the sinister kids, instead we have aliens (what else? Post X-FILES, no film can be complete without an alien in a jar) with glowing multicoloured eyes. Unfortunately, the special effects are rubbish, and look far too computer generated to be anything but realistic. The 'horror' in the film comes from the series of murders that the children commit.In 1960, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED achieved fame from a chilling atmosphere of the unknown. In 1995, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED achieves nothing with a handful of boring murders, which aren't even particularly gory. The most gruesome demise is that of Kirstie Alley, but it has to be said that we were pretty thankful it took place; Alley sleepwalks through her role here and comes off as totally unlikeable. The same can be said of Christopher Reeve, who gives such a bland, expressionless performance that you can't help but smile at the end. His riding accident which left him crippled took place right after the completion of this film; it's disappointing that he had the misfortune to end his able-bodied career on this note. The only actor of interest in the film is Mark Hamill as a shotgun wielding vicar who gives an over the top performance bordering on psychotic. He's fun.The children are annoying bad/cute child actors and actresses, who try very hard to look sinister but fail miserably. The only moments worth watching in this film are the comic scene where a man is burnt on a barbecue, or the ending where policemen and soldiers all suddenly start shooting each other for no reason. There is also some tension in the explosive finale, but it comes far too late to lift this film from being anything other than a middling, stupid affair.",Village of the Damned
2,SnoopyStyle,The kids the only cool thing in the movie,5,13 October 2014,"A mysterious shadow passes over the small coastal town of Midwich, California which makes everybody unconscious when they are inside the perimeter. Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) was out of town during the incident. Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) is with the feds National Science Foundation. Frank (Michael Paré) is killed during the incident leaving his school principal wife Jill McGowan (Linda Kozlowski) a widow. Mark Hamill plays Reverend George. Then they discover that every woman got pregnant and just as surprisingly, every one of them wants to keep their babies. Single girl Melanie Roberts (Meredith Salenger) has a still born. The children grow up smart superior beings with telepathic powers. Mara Chaffee (Lindsey Haun) is the leader of the children. David McGowan (Thomas Dekker) is the runt who lost his mate when Melanie Roberts lost her child.This is a movie that could use a '5 years later' insert. Once nobody is willing to abort their babies, the movie can jump ahead. There is nothing absolutely necessary other than the alien baby and that may have been better as a reveal much later in the movie. The movie needs to jump to the creepy kids because that's the best part. Lindsey Haun is terrific as the cold-hearted leader and Thomas Dekker is adorable. They are the only cool thing about the movie.",Village of the Damned
3,claudio_carvalho,Interesting Remake of the 1960 Masterpiece,7,27 September 2020,"One day, in the village of Midwhich, the whole population and animals faint at the same time, causing many accidents and attracting authorities to the mysterious behavior including Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley). Out of the blue, people and animals awake, and soon the local Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) realizes that all the women are pregnant, including a teenage virgin and Mrs. X, whose husband has been traveling for one year. The towners have a meeting to decide what to do with the babies, but Dr. K seduces them with the promise of a large allowance from the government to keep the babies for further research. When the babies grow-up, their parents realize that they have dark powers and soon they realize that Midwhich is in danger with the insidious children. What can be done to stop them?John Carpentsr's ""The Village of the Damned"" is an interesting remake of the 1960 masterpiece. The storyline is basically the same but with state-of-art special effects. The creepy and dark conclusion fits well to the plot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Cidade dos Amaldiçoados"" (""The Village of the Damned"")",Village of the Damned
4,gavin6942,An Alright Film With Great Supplements,6,5 April 2016,"A small town's women give birth to unfriendly alien children posing as humans.At the time this movie was made, John Carpenter was owed a movie by Universal. He was actually hoping to do a remake of ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"". Instead, they offered him ""Village"" and he agreed. The script had interestingly been worked on by none other than Wes Craven, and then Carpenter made his own changes: pushing to make it closer to the original version, but with a female perspective.The casting is pretty great, which is not unusual for a Carpenter film. He has always surrounded himself with good actors. Chris Reeve and Kirstie Alley are the big names, but horror fans appreciate the supporting cast: Buck Flower, Michael Pare, Peter Jason, Mark Hamill. Even the kids in retrospect have become small horror icons in their own way. Thomas Dekker, the main child, has gone to on play John Connor in the ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"" and appeared in the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" remake.Charlotte Gravenor, the hairstylist, bleached the hair of the actors who played the children, and then applied white hairspray to their hair. This made them appear like aliens, and in some cases even made their hair fall out. Bruce Nicholson and Greg Nicotero applied a special effect where the eye pupil colors change when the children seize control of the adults. Critics said that the eye effect was ""less impressive"" than the hair effect. And I would agree. The hair is very striking, and works great with the black-and-white theme, whereas the eyes are just alright.At this point in Carpenter's career, he was not making the big hits he is best known for. Although one or two more films were pretty decent, it is interesting to see how this fits into his arc. Carpenter himself has said he wasn't ""passionate"" about making ""Village"". Was this the cause of its less-than-stellar reception by fans? Was it just caught up in the trajectory? Or maybe Carpenter had lost his ""passion"" for directing altogether... The Scream Factory disc includes an all-new ""Horror's Hallowed Grounds"" with my good friend Sean Clark. This may be his best one yet, though the sound volume seems very uneven. There is an impressive (44-minute!) retrospective on the career of Peter Jason, who (among many other things) appeared in seven Carpenter films. He has such great tales of working with Orson Welles, among others. This is the hidden gem that makes the disc worthwhile. The film retrospective, with Carpenter, Sandy King, Michael Pare, many of the child actors, and others, is also great, and at 50 minutes very thorough. I could complain about the lack of audio commentary, but with thee features it would probably be unnecessary. Well done, Scream! One of your better discs.",Village of the Damned
5,lee_eisenberg,what happens to Christopher Reeve sort of foretells what happened to him soon after,7,16 January 2007,"Looking back on John Carpenter's (happy birthday, John!) remake of ""Village of the Damned"", it's surprising to see Christopher Reeve here, given that the movie came out right before his accident paralyzed him. If there is any connection - and I admit that I may be going overboard in trying to analyze this - it's that the movie portrays something seemingly impossible happening in this small town, and it probably seemed impossible for the former Superman to get paralyzed.But like I said, I'm probably trying too hard to read into the movie. As for the movie itself, I liked it. Like most of Carpenter's movies, it's good for some entertainment, and certainly creates a horrific feel (and of course, there's the possibility that it's an allegory for rejection of new kinds of people). Worth seeing. Also starring Kirstie Alley, Linda Kozlowski, Michael Pare and Mark Hamill. I guess that it was inevitable that Superman and Luke Skywalker would eventually co-star.PS: Christopher Reeve and Mark Hamill share a birth-date: 27 September 1952.",Village of the Damned
6,rmax304823,Eyeballs From Hell.,3,25 July 2007,"The original ""Village of the Damned"" was a taut, lean black-and-white story of some telepathic alien kids growing up in an English village, causing grief and anxiety before being collectively extinguished by their professor, the only person in the village whom they needed.This film, 35 years later, sticks more or less to the same narrative path, based as it is on the novel and the earlier screenplay, but is louder, splashier, and gorier. It's not nearly as original or powerful as the first version.I'll just give one example of what I mean. Almost at the very beginning of the 1960 film, we see the professor (George Sanders) drop unconscious to the floor while speaking on the phone. Wolf Rilla, the director, cuts to other gray village sites and shows us bodies sprawled in awkward positions on the ground, the floor, the furniture. A bath runs over. An iron burns a shirt. There is no musical score, no sound but running water from the bath. We get the complete picture. Everyone and every thing is knocked out cold, and the spell lasts for an hour or two.In this version John Carpenter, the director, gives us a livelier opening in full color, presenting the cast of characters, which is an okay choice, but when the spell descends on the small town and scenes show us unconscious bodies all over the place, the visuals are accompanied by an irritating assemblage of electronic noises that, one supposes, are designed to be ""eerie"" or ""spooky"" but simply don't compare to the matter-of-fact but ominous silence of the original. And here, too, a bath runs over. But instead of a shirt burning, a man burns. Another man, struck unconscious while driving, has his pickup roll off the road and collide with an object. Does the truck explode in a fireball? Are you kidding? This sense of the endlessly conventional, of excess run amok, continues throughout the movie. The original was not a profound work but it did raise some interesting issues, illustrating them without directly addressing them. Here, the issues are spelled out in pompous speeches -- ""You are not HUMAN if you don't feel emotion!"" Of the performances, I could only credit Linda Kozlovsky's and Chris Reeve's. The others are either forgettable or, worse, unforgettable. (The kids all speak with a lisp.) The original was not aimed at a highbrow audience or even an especially adult sensibility but it succeeded in reaching everyone. This one aims lower and flunks. Nice location shooting, though. The comedian Mort Sahl used to joke that the residents of Marin County were always trying to get the toll raised on the Golden Gate Bridge to keep out the riff-raff.",Village of the Damned
7,ma-cortes,Some women give birth various strange children with supernatural power and extraordinary intelligence,6,2 November 2011,"Acceptable Carpenter's remake with the premise is still interesting enough to watch it , dealing about several strangely emotionless children all born at the same time in a small village in Midwich . The scene is an American village of Midwich in which rare mist overcomes the idyllic coastal location . At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. Everybody falls into a deep, mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. When the army gets involved, they find this force has precise boundaries. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. Some months later every woman (Linda Kozlowski , Meredith Salenger) capable of child-bearing is pregnant . All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant. And the glowing-eyed children they have will prove to be worse than what they could have feared. The children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange, penetrating eyes that make people do things they don't want to do ; all of them have telephatic powers . They result to be mind-controlling demons or aliens . Meanwhile the doctor (good performance by Christopher Reeve) along with a scientist (Kirstie Alley in a new role who doesn't appear in the former film and doesn't do much sense) attempt to stop their plans of conquest .This Sci-Fi thriller contains chills , suspense , intrigue and creepy events about some precocious deadly children and their quest of power . However, it suffers from unimaginative account because being a copy from original film (1960) by Wolf Rilla with more violent and explicit scenes and fails to provide the intelligent atmosphere from previous story . Furthermore , it packs better cinematography by Gary Kibbe who photographs colorful scenarios from the village .Suspenseful and thrilling musical score by the same director John Carpenter .Other renditions based on John Wyndham novel titled ¨The Midwich cuckoos¨ and well adapted by Stirling Silliphant are the following : The black and white classic (1960) by Wolf Rilla with George Sanders , Michael G. Wynne and Barbara Shelley and followed by ¨Children of the damned (64)¨ by Anton Leader with Ian Hendry , Alan Badel and Barbara Ferris . Rating : Acceptable and passable , providing pleasant screams for the viewer . Essential and indispensable seeing for John Carpenter followers .",Village of the Damned
8,dbdumonteil,Damned remake,1,8 May 2002,"Why oh why oh why do remake exist?Who needs them anyway?Wolf Rilla's work (1960)does exist,it's often shown on TV around the world.This is a classic,still very impressive today.Yes it's in black and white .Yes it's a very short movie (70 min).And no,there are no stars.(actually there's one:George Sanders,sorry).And yet it's a must -see.John Carpenter is one of the worst directors of the fantastic genre.Everything he touches turns into dirt.He's never invented anything:all that he does is either obnoxious remakes(this one,""the thing"")or rehash of better works (""Christine"" and ""duel"" for instance)...or horrible horror ""original"" stuff (""prince of darkness"",""Halloween"",""vampires"").His atrocious strident music follows suit.There is not one ghost of an idea here,unless the ending-leaving-the -door-open-for - a-sequel(Oh god preserve us)counts.The dialogue is triteness itself in the first part:uninteresting cardboard characters,whom we've seen a thousand times or more,exchanging trivialities which are a saddening bore.The second part ,more ""intellectual"",is a rehash of the humanist views of the late fifties/early sixtiessci-fi (C.Reeve urging the wiz kids to tryemotion,feelings,tenderness).Please do yourself a pleasure,and watch Wolf Rilla's version.",Village of the Damned
9,Quinoa1984,how can evil be so... bland?,5,2 April 2008,"John Carpenter more than likely did this one of the paycheck, not much else. There aren't really many markers of it being a balls-to-the-wall Carpenter flick, even with his name, per usual, above the title. I've never seen the 1960 original sci-fi movie (one which some have told me lives up to its classic cult stature), but I can guess that even within its B-movie limitations it pulled off similar material with more gravitas. Much like it's any-town USA setting, it's about as exciting as white bread. What Carpenter didn't really break through a whole lot in his interpretation is how to show us what's to be scared of as opposed to what is done, which is basically *telling* us to be scared. There's a difference (and it's not to say it's a failure, it's a somewhat well-directed picture, though 'somewhat' as in nowhere near what the director is usually capable of). But this might be a likely example that critics could make for Carpenter losing his 'spark' in his later films, which thankfully isn't entirely true.It's a story of alien (or some kind of) insemination, where all the women in a small town are knocked up during a 'black-out' where some chemical makes everyone unconscious for a couple of hours. Scientists watch closely (i.e. Kirstie Alley, motivation- smoke cigarette), and none of the women, oddly enough, feel this is peculiar enough to abort their oncoming spawn. Instead they welcome them into the world, and they very quickly become the little creepy rules of the town. Of course, the 'Man of Steel' (or rather here trying to be 'Mind of Steel') Christopher Reeve won't sit down easily for these extra-terrestrial tykes. It becomes a kind of game of 'do you want to adapt, or just dominate?' And it's not much of a game after a while, except with the mind control thing, and the one kid, David, who just doesn't know how to join the cool kids with those pesky emotions.All of this should, and could, be ripe for Carpenter's picking. But he directs it (and maybe this is just in pan and scan) like a TV movie, and ironically the most recent works of his, Cigarette Burns and Pro-Life, both shot for Showtime, look a helluva lot more appealing for the cinema than this. Only one scene, where a grizzled janitor comes in and heckles the kids and is met with a very gruesome death, seems to spell out the full-blown bad-ass mind-set that has his personage above the title card. The rest of it is just, well... there, I guess. What could have laid for some really outrageous exploration of territory previously met (or, perhaps, an even more direct approach to the original novel as opposed to an adaptation of the 1960 film's script) seems like rote work, professional but non-committal to challenging us with the material. Why not get into some of the other questions here. Is it just part of the society that didn't want to abort any of the pregnancies, or was it simply mind control? Why was Reeve the only one who could do the 'brick wall/ocean' trick? Hell, why not make it an all out bloody war? These questions, and more, are left for a by-the-numbers treatment, and it's a shame. It's watchable for the time it's on, but there's no reason to go back to it again.",Village of the Damned
10,wes-connors,John Carpenter's Midwich Horror,3,1 November 2009,"""From the master of suspense, John Carpenter, comes a chilling new version of the sci-fi classic. Something is terribly wrong in the tiny village of Midwich. After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town, ten women mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birth,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, ""and the reign of terror begins."" Mr. Carpenter doesn't evoke either the other ""master of suspense"" (Alfred Hitchcock), or even Wolf Rilla; although, he does include examples of his own abilities to startle. Still, this is a curious and uninspired re-make. About the only thing that works is some added characterization for ""David"" (Thomas Dekker) and the feminization given ""Mara"" (Lindsey Haun). The original ""Village of the Damned"" (1960) is the one to see; return to this film for the curiosity, an embarrassed cast, and a few laughs.*** Village of the Damned (4/28/95) John Carpenter ~ Christopher Reeve, Linda Kozlowski, Kirstie Alley, Thomas Dekker",Village of the Damned
11,Coventry,Damned remakes!,4,23 May 2004,"Back in 1982, it was John Carpenter who proved that remakes don't necessarily have to be pointless updates with less thinking and more budget. His version of `The Thing (from another world)' really was a tribute to the original and a milestone horror movie itself. Yet, it seems Carpenter already lost these skills, seeing his `Village of the Damned' is an irritating and highly uninteresting film. Thankfully, the plot and structure remains loyal to Wyndham's novel as well as the original film from 1960. This brilliant original was modest, sober and very straight-to-the-point production, but it immensely effective and still one of the scariest movies I ever saw. Carpenter retells the story of the little white-haired freaks but (regretfully) adds too much sentiment and ethics. Granted, it still has quite a few eerie moments but it isn't nearly as terrifying as the black and white original. Thus, in case Village of the Damned scared you, I strongly recommend to hunt down the original! Carpenter focuses a lot more on the intellectual capabilities of the children and lets them talk too much. This effect, compared to silent and staring youngsters, loses a lot of its impacts. By the way, the `leader' of the children now is a girl.I guess that's due to the role of feminism over the years. Village of the Damned also suffers for a dreadfully bad casting job. Kirstie Alley is miscast as the stone-cold doctor who holds back essential information. Skywalker Hamill plays the town's priest which isn't exactly the role of his life neither. Christopher Reeve is rather good in the role George Sanders terrifically played earlier. Overall, John Carpenter's Village of the Damned certainly isn't the worst movie ever, but it one of the most redundant ones ever made",Village of the Damned
12,michaelRokeefe,Remake of a 60's thriller. At least the effects were good.,6,1 May 2000,"Being a John Carpenter fan, I expected way more than I got. Thirty five years after the original and you would think there would be a lot of improvement. The bad deeds were more interesting. The children's glowing eyes did seem more wicked. But these things did not save this movie.Groups of women around the world are having emotionless children that have a way of dismissing people they don't like. Greedy, unfriendly and power hungry little kids from WHEREVER!  Kirstie Alley and Linda Kozlowski seemed to have taken their parts pretty seriously. Mark Hamill was more or less wasted. Cold popcorn rates over Christopher Reeve. I can't blame Mr. Carpenter for the finished project. I'm sure he meant well with what he had to work with.",Village of the Damned
13,Theo Robertson,Not A Disaster But Not Great Either,6,26 October 2011,"John Carpenter's VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is considered a rather weak film . With hindsight one would have expected more since his version of THE THING is considered a classic of genre horror . But did you know it isn't a reputation that was instant ? THE THING from 1982 totally bombed at the box office and many critics were turned off by the stomach churning visuals . The reputation grew down to the fact that ET influenced film makers in to making nice family films about cute aliens coming to Earth to be saved from the nasty humans by nice cute kids . Like wise THE THING special effects are indeed special where a crew of effects artists slaved day and night to create something special . By the mid 1990s film makers were getting lazy and relied on CGI . Even some like myself who hated THE THING on its initial release can appreciate it in a nostalgic light Hopes must have been high that Carpenter could weave a similar kind of magic to this remake and surpass the original but tellinglly as the credits come up you'll notice the 1960 screenplay by Stirling Silliphant is namechecked . Silliphant wrote a very faithful adaptation of the original Wyhdham novel and this shouldn't be viewed as a criticism . This means however that if you know the story there's not a lot of surprises to the story . There also seems to be a bit of compromise involved and that is Carpenter includes violent scenes that are in no way gory . I did appreciate the lack of gore such as when Kirsty Alley's spook disembowel's herself but can understand why some people didn't like and would have preferred a bit more blood . Likewise the final shoot out seems to be included to put a bit of action in to a movie that by its very mechanics is a very slow burning type of mystery and does tend to jar with the rest of the storyIn all VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is by no means a bad film , certainly not as bad as some people claim it to be but by the same yard stick there's no one claiming it's any way better than the original 1960 British film , probably down to a lack of embellishment and a very much TVM feel to the proceedings",Village of the Damned
14,poolandrews,Average at best.,5,13 December 2006,"Village of the Damned starts one ordinary day in the small American coastal town of Midwich where at precisely 10 O'clock in the morning every living thing faints into unconsciousness. News of the strange phenomenon quickly spreads & government agent Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) is there giving out orders before anyone knows whats hit them, everyone seems baffled as the area in which the strange occurrence has happened is clearly defined, very odd. Suddenly at six O'clock, four hours after the initial black-out, everything & everyone regains consciousness. However the oddness doesn't stop there as the local quack Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) quickly realises that a large number of the female population of Midwich are pregnant including the local virgin (there's always one...), pregnancy's that stem from the day of the black-out. The months pass & the babies are born but as they grow into children there definitely seems to be something wrong with them & why re so may of the townspeople having 'accidents' & committing suicide...Directed by John Carpenter I thought Village of the Damned was an OK time waster but it didn't exactly knock my socks off. The script by David Himmelstein was based on the original Village of the Damned (1960) which I have seen & the first obvious difference is that it is now set in an American town & not an English village which was the setting that served the original so well. While the film moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't that boring as a whole Ididn't think it worked, the character played by Kirstie Alley for instance seems only to be included so Capenter can use her whenever the need for some scientific exposition is called for even though the origins of the children are never really made clear although the script hints at aliens. Many of the other character's also feel surplus to requirements except to be killed off by the children for the most minor of reasons which never convince, I mean why make your mum put her hand in a pot of boiling water? Think about it, why? There's no reason whatsoever. It's watchable for sure, in fact when I think about it one reason why I may not have much love for this is because I've seen the original which this follows quite closely so the story wasn't particularly surprising & I sort of knew where everything was going.Director Carpenter has a fine CV of horror & sci-fi to his name although I doubt Village of the Damned will be anywhere near the top of it. It's fairly ironic when you consider that Carpenter directed possibly the greatest remake ever when he helmed The Thing (1982) which was a brilliant retelling of The Thing from Another World (1951). Unfortunately the children themselves inspire bouts of laughter rather than fear, they look absolutely terrible with white hair & glowing eyes. The film lacks scares & atmosphere & is a bit flat.With a supposed budget of about $22,000,000 I was amazed when I found out, where did all the money go? It looks more like an average made-for-TV film than a 20 plus million Hollywood blockbuster. The acting is so-so, Village of the Damned is probably the only film where you will see Luke Skywalker & Superman together...Village of the Damned is an OK film, I didn't think much of it & I doubt I'd watch it again. The story would probably have made a better X-Files (1993 - 2002) episode rather than a full length feature film.",Village of the Damned
15,utgard14,Unnecessary remake is one of Carpenter's weakest films,4,5 November 2013,"Garbage remake of a classic film replaces subtlety, originality, and intelligence with in-your-face shock violence. This is especially sad knowing this film came from a director I admire a great deal, John Carpenter. He was running out of steam in the 90's and it shows here. Gone is the smart script, tense direction, and memorable performances of the first film. Here you have a movie with a significantly larger budget made 30 years later and it fails to capture any of the chilling effectiveness of the original. The children are not spooky. They wear bad wigs and do not grip you with a sense of uneasiness the way they did in the other film. Even if you try to remove comparisons between the films and judge this on its own merits, it's still a weak effort that fails on most levels.

They were out for six hours, so I imagine that the aliens had a good time.The Mexicans beat John Carpenter in a remake of Wolf Rilla's 1960 sci-fi/horror film, but I doubt if anyone ever saw it. This was a good story and it was creepy to boot. All those blond-haired children has to remind you of the children of the Third Reich. I am sure that they did this with a purpose. Perfection achieved, but at the sacrifice of humanity.I haven't seen Christopher Reeve since Superman I,II, and II, and he really did a good job here.

17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,An A for atmosphere,7,29 July 2009,"Carpenter seems incapable of actually making something not worth watching... I have certainly yet to see something of his that qualifies. Even the ones of his films that I didn't expect to love, I've always at least liked. This isn't his very best, no, but it certainly delivers. It pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits start rolling. I haven't seen the original, of which this is a remake, nor have I read the novel. Thus, I can make no comparisons, although I certainly have no problem with the prospect of pursuing them. The mood is expertly built up. Most of the acting performances are great, including those of the children. The majority of the effects are excellent, and they're never downright bad. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The plot is well-told and develops nicely, with surprises along the way(I can, of course, not verify if they are expected by those already familiar with the story from earlier sources). This is terrifying, and there are no cheap ""jump scares"" that don't pay off. The dialog is well-written and quotable. All of the music is the relatively simple(if it ain't broke don't fix it), well-composed pieces that John usually gives us. I recommend this to any fans of him, and to a lesser extent, anyone else who helped create this. 7/10",Village of the Damned

One of the best efforts about it comes from the absolutely chilling effect here done with the titular children, who are quite possibly among the most chilling and terrifying kids seen in the genre. The pale, pale features, light blond hair, emotionless faces, monotone voice and insane ability to continually be with each other in numerous groups for each of the different encounters manages to make for quite an effective time here even before getting to their powers with their physical appearance generating quite a large amount of scares enough. The powers that come into play here are utterly effective as well, making for some great times here with the effect of the spinning eyes and flashing lights emanating from there which all centers around the idea of them being aliens or some other life-force that happened upon the scene and really makes for quite a fun time overall here. Those powers are given quite a wide berth here which comes from some really great action scenes including the early scenes of them out in town causing the mass amounts of suicides by jumping over cliffs, driving vehicles into exploding canisters or just generally forcing their will upon others and makes for a grand set-up to the second half where they take over the town and set-off into the barn to be by themselves which is really quite enjoyable as there's plenty of fun here with them taking out the Army troop sent in to kill them and the finale where he has them trapped alone with him. These here do manage to make this good enough to hold out over the few minor flaws on display, namely from the first half here where there's just way too much mystery going on that doesn't get resolved at all. Not only does this part feature the mysterious wave that comes over the people but it's also entirely unclear how exactly that enabled the woman to become pregnant as nothing was shown to have happened to them in order to cause this nor did anyone say anything about how it happened. The whole pregnancy angle is a huge question mark, and leaving it as unexplained as it does is quite troublesome, as is the remaining parts of this since it's built up around the governmental protection policy of studying the children which never comes to fruition and it all seems to go back to normal anyway almost immediately after. As well, the last real flaw here is the rather bland way they tend to go about enforcing their will on people, as they just flash their eyes and that's about it. The effect is cool, but it doesn't really provide much in the visual sense. Otherwise, this was quite fun and highly enjoyable.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language and continuous threatening actions toward children.",Village of the Damned
20,Rainey-Dawn,Not A Bad Remake,7,7 September 2016,"Not a bad remake of the 1960 classic film. Carpenter did add some violence to this remake... 1995 people are wanting more on-screen, more blood, guts and violence in their films - so Carpenter gave them some but it's not overly violent or bloody. I don't think this film is violent or bloody enough to satisfy most teens of the 1990s.The story is a pretty good alien story to begin with and I think the cast and crew did a good job on this remake. No, it is not the original but it's still a pretty good sci-fi horror movie to kick back and enjoy.As far as the children, I think both the 1960 and 1995 films are very creepy kids! I would be very nervous with them around - and the longer I was with them, the more I learned about them the more frightened I would become - if this was real! lol.7/10",Village of the Damned
21,disdressed12,one of Carpenter's best,9,29 December 2006,"One of John carpenter's best movies.the basic premise is that an unknown force passes over the small village of Midwich,at which point every living thing goes unconscious,awakening many hours later with no memory of the event.it is soon discovered that nearly all of the women are pregnant dating from the time of the blackout.once the children are born,it is discovered that they are almost identical to one another.it is also soon revealed that these children are not what they appear to be. the movie is basically an update on the 1960's classic Children of the Damned.Obviously it has been changed for contemporary audiences,but the core of the story remains the same.there are some first rate acting performances here.Christopher Reeve proves he can act in a non Superman role as Dr.Allen Chaffee,and Kirstie Alley also shows some acting chops as Dr.Susan Verner.Also in the cast are Michael Par^e and mark Hamill,also with fine performances.but the real credit must go to young Lindsey Haun(11 at the time)who steals every scene she is in as Mara,the leader of the children.This girl send shivers done your spine with simply a look.she is quite terrifying.brilliant performance in a brilliant movie.special note must also be made to the score of this movie,co written by Carpenter.very haunting and eerie music,a perfect fit for this movie",Village of the Damned
22,The-Sarkologist,The fear that others will take our place,5,27 December 2013,"John Carpenter seems to like putting his name with his movies as the official title of this movie is ""John Carpenter's Village of the Damned."" This movie is not his original though, rather it is based upon a movie made in 1960 and a book by John Wyndym, who also wrote Day of the Triffids. My friend described this movie as a ""B-grade horror movie"" and I am sort of inclined to agree with him except that there is a little more to it than simply nasty monsters.One Saturday afternoon, the entire village of Midwich falls asleep. The doctor (Christopher Reeve) is out of town and when he returns he finds that the FBI, state police, and army stand at the road leading in. They are all mystified as to why everybody fell asleep. Later they all wake up (and a graphic scene of a man having been cooked when he fell asleep on a barbecue is shown) and soon it is discovered that all of the women in the town are pregnant. Nine months later about nine children are born, four females and five males. One of the babies is still-born and quickly taken away by the FBI scientist (Kirsty Alley). These children grow up to become very intelligent and possessive of psionic abilities, and they begin to take control of the town.The nature of the children need be examined before the entirety of the film is looked at. These children are albino and travel in male/female pairs, all except one whose female partner died in childbirth. These children have no emotion and consider themselves to be the superior to the human race. Where they come from it not clearly explained, but that is the nature of horror movies, there is no need for explanation.The single child, David, is one of the keys to the movie. As he does not have a partner, he begins to evolve differently to the children. He begins to understand pain due to the emptiness that the absence of his partner causes. He is torn between looking for a place within the children and without. His desire to belong and his loyalty to the other children cause a conflict within. The leader of the children is a female, and this is possibly a symbol of the nature of the children. They are opposed to everything that humanity stands for. They view humanity as an enemy and thus a female, generally considered the submissive sex, rises to become the leader of the children to challenge this aspect of humanity.There are two basic fears within this movie: the fear that there exists a race that is supremely more powerful than humanity, and the parental fear that their children will rise to take their place. One of the major themes is that the children are superior to humanity. They exist to replace humanity and to destroy them. This is a basic fear as humans generally want to be the dominant. The problem is that we are not. Our fear of an extra-powerful entity is justified with the existence of God. People deal with this by making God their ally in everything they do. God is somebody, to most people, that lives with humans and demands nothing. This is not true for God demands obedience and we refuse to give it. Because we refuse to acknowledge him he will destroy us, and because of this we should respect who he is.The second fear, that of parents towards the children, is also a justified one. At one stage a parent will have many expectations of the child, but as the child grows and begins to become independent, this changes. There is generally a struggle between the child and the parent with the child wanting to go his or her own way while the parent wanting his/her will for the child. This movie manifests the ultimate fear that the child is superior to the parent and also uncontrollable. It is not the parent who controls the child but the child who controls the parent. Not only are the children in control of their parents but they also have the power of life and death over the parents, as is revealed quite quickly in the movie.I enjoyed Village of the Damned. It was not a movie that stands above other movies, but it is one in which there is some thought. The horror in this movie is more subtle than a lot of other movies, the horror being more social than spiritual.",Village of the Damned
23,slightlymad22,Christopher Reeve's Last movie Before His Accident.,7,8 November 2014,"With an all star cast Christopher Reeve (Superman The Movie) Linda Kozlowski (Crocodile Dundee) Kirsty Alley (Cheers) and Luke Skywalkwr himself Mark Hamill, John Carpenters ""Village Of The Damned"" is certainly a well acted and entertaining movie. Plot In A Paragraph: The quiet little American town of Midwich, is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. This was the final feature film completed by Christopher Reeve before a horse riding accident on 27 May 1995 left him paralyzed. Reeve was a splendid actor, who at the height of his popularity, rather than appear running round with his top off shooting a gun in mainstream action pics chose to make interesting movies with a good story and good characters. (He was quoted as saying ""I wanted to be an actor, not an action star"") Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than Superman/Clark Kent, and he ended up making TV movies like this to pay the bills. ""Somewhere In Time"" one of his flops upon release, is one of my favourite movies and one can't help but wonder what other wonderful films we may have missed out on.",Village of the Damned
24,Movie Nuttball,Great John Carpenter movie!,10,10 October 2003,"John Carpenter's Village of the Damned in My opinion is one of his best and darkest films! The cast was really good which includes Christopher Reeves, Mark Hamil, Kirstie Alley, Linda Kozlowski, Michael Paré, and Peter Jason! I really liked Christopher Reeves and Mark Hamil's characters especially Hamil's. I don't know but there is just something about his character that is unique. The film is top notch with excellent music and direction by John Carpenter! If you are a Carpenter fan and love horror movies then I recommend Village of the Damned!Movie Nuttball's note: It was so cool to Christopher Reeves and Mark Hamil in a movie together. It was like Luke Skywalker from Tatooine and Superman from Krypton joining each other for a movie! It is really cool to check out!",Village of the Damned
25,Dr_Coulardeau,Slightly too cold on a very hot subject,9,23 July 2008,"A classic of science fiction by John Wyndham, The Midwich Cuckoos. John Carpenter makes it into a film that is disquieting. The end of the world will never come of course but it is all already programmed within our own genetic heritage. Evil is in our genes in the possibility that is being developed and progressively monitored by the social system that our human nature is producing to see the end of emotions, of empathy and compassion, the end of any kind of emotion. It is all the more disquieting because this social system of ours is producing absolute individualism and yet it is this very absolute individualism, when becoming the common point of a certain group of people that will lead them to absolute and cold is not glacial power and destructivity in the sole name of survival. That sounds and is horrible but absolutely possible. There is no difference between these mutants and the posse that is going to lynch them. They only want to survive even if that means the destruction of the other antagonistic group. But the story has no way out, no smallest ounce of hope. The doctor whose wife produced one of the children who should have been ten and are nine because of a still born will eventually use dynamite to destroy them. Even if you want to go beyond the divide you will unavoidably be led to the conclusion this divide is an absolute barrier. You will be transformed into a monster yourself. There is no escape and it is not the fact that the David who lost his mate who was the still born is escaping with his mother that promises a better future that will bring us hope. Alone he might be nothing, his feelings for his lost and unknown mate might be movingly pathetic but he cannot go against his genetic nature and his genetic nature is to look for a mate, for a partner in survival. Yet I found Carpenter's characters slightly too superficial, not deep enough, too cold in one word, though Carpenter is simple and that is an asset in the genre, no baroque or even rococo over-killing. That's lucky because those kids are nothing but a new branch or brand of Nazi SS, and those new branches or brands are becoming by far too many and too common in our modern world though they are always isolated in one little section of the world and have not been able so far to go beyond two or three places at the same time. But they are mobile and that is the real danger because they can eventually build some kind of a network. This time it is becoming really scary.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Village of the Damned
26,poe426,"Birth control, courtesy of John Carpenter...",9,13 July 2010,"The pros far outweigh the cons in this remake: for one thing, Carpenter gives us an idea of what it might be like for the WOMEN who have been so mysteriously violated (something I don't recall at all in the original, although I like the original); for another, his always outstanding craftsmanship makes for pleasant viewing- and, despite some of the more horrific elements of the story (as when Kirstie Ally is forced to dissect herself), he once again shows remarkable restraint. Of course, there ARE a few surprisingly out of place moments (for a movie crafted by the best director this country has ever produced): the janitor dummy, for instance. But, minor cavils aside, Carpenter once again handles an ensemble piece like a true professional. There are moments of great visual beauty in this film and, coupled with scenes of skin-crawling terror, VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is yet another feather in the cap of the Master of Mood.",Village of the Damned
27,filipemanuelneto,It's not as bad as many people say.,6,18 December 2018,"Remakes made to make money quickly are a common thing in the film industry. To be honest, only a short time ago I knew that this movie was a remake. In fact, he became more famous than his predecessor, although the experts praised him and said that this film had no reason to exist beyond the profit he could raise. They may even be right, but this movie survived the test of time, and its predecessor did not.Why did this happen? I think the weight of the director, John Carpenter, had a lot to do with it. Carpenter was able to create around him a legion of admirers, keeping alive his work. On the other hand, we still have Christopher Reeve, the eternal superman, in the lead role.The script is the same as the original film: a group of children with similar characteristics grows in a secluded location after a bizarre incident where several women get pregnant without knowing how. Children quickly become the focus of bizarre accidents where adults self-mutilate or commit suicide for no apparent reason, as if deprived of their own will.I recognize that this movie is not the best of Carpenter. It is far from that! But I can not throw it in the trash. Unlike some people, I felt that children were an intimidating presence, not so much for what they could do but for their lack of humanity and for the possibilities they had at hand. The film frightens us more by what makes us think than by what it shows us. However, the film ends up being lost, by embarking on easier and more predictable ways, with the action being more and more banal. Christopher Reeve stands out at this point, his good performance being an element that prevents the second half of the film from being deeply unpleasant.",Village of the Damned

I'm a big fan of most of the films of John Carpenter. This is not one of his best movies but it's not one of his worst either. It's a watchable movie. It has more than a couple worthwhile moments. It often feels like a weak Stephen King movie. The cast of B-listers do a nice job. John Carpenter makes this one worth a watch. In lesser hands it probably wouldn't be worth the trouble.",Village of the Damned
29,Anonymous_Maxine,"An entertaining film that remains faithful to the original, but the remake of The Village of the Damned just doesn't manage to reach the same level or mysterious creepiness of the 1960 original.",6,10 September 2002,"First of all, the kids in this version are so goofy that it almost ruins the movie just because it's so hard to take them seriously. That lead girl is pretty convincingly evil, but as the movie goes on and with repeat viewings (yes, I've seen this movie several times. Feel free to judge me), she becomes more and more clownish. This is kind of like the remake of Psycho, it just wasn't necessary, and also like Psycho, The Village of the Damned is a film that's better in black and white. Shooting it in color takes away a lot of the potential that the movie had to be really creepy and scary. It brings the story itself too much into the light of reality, and the subject matter of a film like this does not stand up very well in the light of reality. This is probably why so many horror films fall completely flat. Maybe if they would come out with more horror films in black and white the genre would not be in such a sad state. With horror films especially, less most definitely is more. There were some other things changed or added in this version that were just frivolous and unnecessary. The increased violence, for example, did absolutely nothing for the story and just reminds us of some disappointing changes that have taken place between the audience of the 1960 version and the audience of the 1995 version. Have we really decayed so much that we need more and more violence in the movies to keep us entertained? I shudder to think.This is one of those movies that I watched when I was in high school and absolutely loved it. I was fascinated with the whole concept of a whole town losing consciousness because of some passing cloud of evil and a few of the women turning up mysteriously pregnant. I loved the mysteriousness of the movie, I was terrified out of my seat, and was overall enormously impressed. But I was in high school. I loved a lot of stupid movies in high school. Kind of like Armageddon. Now that I know something about movies I can look at something like this with a little bit more of an informed point of view. The story is undeniably interesting, but it was just as interesting in the original. I am sad to see that the great John Carpenter, one of the better directors of the horror genre, has directed a completely unnecessary remake of a film that could only be made worse with the addition of color and all kinds of augmented violence and goofy special effects. They eye trickery that they pulled in this movie was pretty cool, but got real old real fast.
Watch this movie. But watch it for the story, not the color or violence or special effects or even for Kirstie Alley. In other words, just watch the original.",Village of the Damned

31,GOWBTW,I liked it!,8,5 August 2007,"Despite of the minor changes from the the 60's version, John Carpenter put some magic in making this movie. One of the changes was there were 9 children instead of 10, the other child was a girl who was stillborn at birth. The women who bore these smart, yet sinister offspring realize their bundle of joy, are a bundle of terror. Only one of the children rebelled against the other eight. I liked the examination scene where the young girl gets her pupils dilated, her eye had a very spooky hue after the drops took effect. Kirstie Alley did a great job playing the shady doctor. Christopher Reeve was also great in his character. It's a shame that horse-riding accident made it his last walking role. Knowing what cause the pregnancies came to front, the town make a way to fight back against the dangerous kids. Only one wasn't interested in the plot, and he's probably find another victim in a few years, or otherwise live peaceful with his only family.

I did think movie would be better as John Carpenter did this remake, So I looking forward to it but soon as the movie started I knew this movie not going to be good. I didn't really like how they kinda change the story , gave really lame back story to kids being borned , there not one moment did have this kids creepy or scary at all.It was tame from start to end and neverfeel moved forward as the movie was such their.I thought this was going to be a lot more better, so how they about to die, we actually see the death scenes in this movie, seen before and the aftermath but not when happens, it cuts way to the kids was lights in there eyes. The acting was really wooden by some of the main cast, I don't maybe they took make this more main stream movie.I think must be worst John carpenter movie but a least movie wasn't boring, it maybe a little intruded how the movie going pan out, even that ending was a load of rubbish.2 out of 10",Village of the Damned

It's just they-get-pregnant and then they-have-them.It picks up when the kids are on the scene. I really like that they don't have a hive mind this time round and the renegade kid was an interesting twist. I love characters that question whether they owe loyalty to their own kind and it plays out very sympathetically.It teeters on the edge of being a greatly satisfying piece of cosmic fiction but it doesn't keep its card close enough to its chest and the camp level is high.The little girl who acts as their leader is totes adorbs in her cold malevolence and she is really what makes this move worth seeing.Not bad, not a classic.

34,lukem-52760,Probably Carpenter's Most Underrated Movie!!!,10,24 October 2020,"Extremely underrated is what comes to mind with John Carpenter's brilliant ""Village of the Damned"" from 1995, it's Excellent in my opinion & has an Awesome ensemble cast with the legendary Christopher Reeve R. I. P (SuperMan films) as our main man here as the small town local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee & he's great in his role & shows what a great actor he was & is better away from just his Iconic Superman role. Kirstie Alley (Cheers,Look Who's Talking) is also really good here as the government Investigator who is monitoring the small town & it's pregnant women after ""The Event"" where everyone in the small town passed out for a few hrs & months later find out most of the ladies sre mysteriously pregnant but by what? & how? All leads to that day of the freaky event. Alley brings a real smartness & strong independent & in charge woman to her role & i personally think it's her best performance & role as scientist Dr. Susan Verner. We also get a nice role for the legendary Mark Hamill (Star Wars Trilogy, The Guyver, Sleepwalkers) & as always Hamill is solid on screen & makes me think he should've been a much bigger star, especially after the Star wars trilogy but he's always entertaining & watchable & here he plays the town Reverend George. There's other small roles for some Carpenter regulars (George Buck Flower & Peter Jason) & also a bit-part for Michael Pare.I genuinely loved this flick since watching it on TV one Saturday night in the late 90's & consider it one of my favourite Carpenter films. Village has all of Carpenter's style & unique tone all over this movie with it's creepy music & it's gorgeous cinematography & big wide shots & lovely imagery & the small all American little Coastal town under attack from something evil like his Classic The Fog (1980) also i really like Carpenter's 90's work & think his Vampires starring James woods is an underrated Masterpiece!!!In the Mouth of Madness is a Cult Classic too, Carpenter is a master storyteller of the weird & Scary, he's easily my favourite movie Director of all time.Also i liked how this is an adult film with adult problems about pregnancy, birth & weird kids lol instead of a bunch of horny teens getting killed.Carpenter frames this movie beautifully & keeps a suspenseful tone throughout as well as a Cool cast of characters to entertain us. No one does mood or Atmosphere better than Carpenter & Village is full of it. The kids are creepy & sinister & i love how the towns people start coming together to fight back against the Evil Children.The music score is fantastic by Carpenter all through ""Village"" & is an underrated soundtrack that too.I just love that 90's fashion too for all the characters & that small town look.Truly an underrated Gem & actually another great movie from John Carpenter & is as thrilling as as anything else he's done.I love 90's Horror & i really miss 90's Horror as i grew up during that special time & was hooked on stuff like TALES FROM THE CRYPT. 80's & 90's were the greatest time for the Horror genre in my opinion.",Village of the Damned
35,drownnnsoda,Atonal and disjointed but reasonably entertaining,6,8 January 2017,"""Village of the Damned,"" an adaptation of the ""Midwich Cuckoos"" and remake of the 1960 film of the same name, chronicles mysterious occurrences in a small Northern California town where a miles-wide blackout occurs among all the residents; inexplicably, ten women in the town find themselves pregnant, and all give birth to children on the same date nine months later. The children exhibit mysterious as they age, and seem to possess a sinister plan.One of the lesser appreciated remakes, ""Village of the Damned"" had something of a lackluster production history, reportedly slapped together and ushered out by Universal Pictures after being severely edited. John Carpenter, in spite of penning and directing one of the most successful independent horror films of all time (""Halloween""), has been hit-and-miss for the majority of his post-""Halloween"" career, and ""Village of the Damned"" is considered by most to be a definite miss. Fans and critics aren't incorrect in saying so either, because the film is far from a success; the main issue it has is that it feels remarkably streamlined and atonal. An example of this is that the narrative briskly and somewhat sloppily progresses from the pre-birth of the children to their elementary school ages, yet there is no sense of time having passed. The ostensible ""main"" characters, a doctor and a government scientist, played by Christopher Reeve and Kirstie Alley, respectively, slip in and out of the narrative carelessly, to the point that they almost seem ancillary. Meredith Salenger plays one of the town's pregnant young women, and the only one to birth a stillborn, while Mark Hamill is the town priest—these characters also seem to fall in and out of the narrative, and the result is that the film doesn't seem to be grounded in any one character. None of the performances are remarkable, though I'd chalk this up largely to the sloppy editing and narrative arrangement.All that said, the film is beautifully shot, and is extremely atmospheric. There are fantastic compositions of the children and moody meditations of the landscape. It's overall an aesthetically interesting film. The special effects feel like overkill at times, especially with the kids' eyes—granted, it was the early nineties when the film was made, so it's permissible, though it does age the film considerably. The extravagant sci-fi effects at the end are decent and more or less effective, though the conclusion feels just as disjointed as the rest of the film.At the end of the day, I can't help but feel like much of the faults in the ""Village of the Damned"" are a direct result of studio intervention that left it feeling like a disjointed hodgepodge of Carpenter's original intention. While it does feel confused, it is at least entertaining and cinematographically astute. Not one of Carpenter's best by any means, though it's difficult to tell how much its defects are a result of weak foundations or Universal's meddling. 6/10.",Village of the Damned

After an unseen force invades a quiet coastal town. Ten woman mysteriously find themselves pregnant. Local Doctor (Christopher Reeve) and an mysterious government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kristie Alley) decide to help each other. When the woman simultaneously give birth... and the reign of terror begins.This is a remake of the 1960 Classic film. The new version is directed by John Carpenter (Escape From New York, Escape From L.A.). Carpenter gives this version with much more explicit violence. Although the original was much more eerie but Carpenter manages to top several key scenes from the original. One of the Highlights of this remake is the Strong Performances by Reeve, Alley, Linda Kozlowski, Mark Hamill (as a Priest!), Thomas Deeker as David and Lindsey Haun ""The Leader of the Emotionless Children"".The Remake does look better in Color than the 1960 Black & White original. This new version was a Box Office disappointment. The film plays better on Video than it did in Theaters but it is a must see in Widescreen, especially Gary B. Kibbe's terrific cinematography. Carpenter cut several scenes before the film's release. Scenes like 9 infants getting up together in the same time (Which is a Babies Puppet F/X from K.N.B EFX Group), 8 Children Attacked and Probably Killing Three Other Children. There is good visual effects by Industrial, Light and Magic. Carpenter Co-Composed the film's music.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an terrific-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD Features are the Original Theatrical Trailer, Bonus Trailer from Other Films and Production Notes. It would have better if the DVD has an audio commentary by Carpenter and Deleted Scenes.

Midwich is a small isolated town on the California coast which is stricken by a mist and sleeping sickness. When people come around all of the women of child-bearing age are pregnant. The offspring are strange, platinum blonds, ultra-intelligent, apparently possessed of ESP. They act against anyone they see as a threat, even seem to have capricious cruelties. In this version the US government get involved. observing the children, sponsoring their families with grants. Kirstie Alley is great as the sinister scientist who at times seems more threatening than the children themselves as she studies this alien invasion. Some disturbing scenes as the children force people to mutilate themselves and commit suicide, the kids even literally melt a foe. Their mind control extends to forcing soldiers to shoot each other. I reckon this film provided inspiration for some of The Simpson's classic tropes as the school janitor acts like Willie and the angry mob brings so many Simpsons episodes to mind. Not one of Carpenter's best films but highly entertaining. 7.5/10.",Village of the Damned
39,I_Ailurophile,You could do worse. But.,5,7 January 2021,"Well this is an oddball cast, isn't it? Christopher Reeve, Kirstie Alley, Mark Hamill - and, of course, regular Carpenter collaborators Peter Jason and George Buck Flower.It's not bad. But it mostly lacks those Carpenter staples, the tension and atmosphere, that he does so well, and that defines his films.At least for me, the beginning of the film is the strongest part here: the ominous event of the town falling unconscious, and the unexplained concurrent pregnancies. Once the creepy kids take over the town, and the narrative, 'Village of the damned' mostly just becomes a series of violent deaths and injuries through psychic manipulation, bereft of substantial style or suspense. At no point is it scary or particularly thrilling otherwise, and despite the efforts of all involved, the bulk of the movie trundles along without any real impact.I'm very much a John Carpenter fan, and this lies near the bottom of his filmography in my opinion. Maybe it's the rose-tinted glasses talking, but I'm inclined to think that's just the nature of the remake--of working with someone else's material instead of his own, and perhaps more specifically with a plot that largely relies on the hit-or-miss horror trope of ""creepy kids.""You could certainly do worse, as far as movies go in this genre. But 'Village of the damned' is hardly extraordinary, and unless you're a Carpenter completionist, the best reason I can think of to recommend it is if one wants to watch something without having to really engage with it.",Village of the Damned
40,TheFearmakers,Teach them well and let them lead the way...,6,22 May 2019,"What happened to John Carpenter in the 1990's is a mystery. Even more mysterious is why it took four years after THEY LIVE to enter that decade, and then direct an unnecessary remake, MEMOIRS OF THE INVISIBLE MAN, which is THE THING compared to what's possibly his worst film, also a remake, titled VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, and yet it's still pretty fun to watch i.e. bag on...Starring a handful of actors and actresses who all starred in franchise films, there's main man Christopher Reeve in his last role before the tragic horse riding accident...Alas, the four-time SUPERMAN is pretty wooden here as the politically-correct husband of one of several townswomen who... after the entire town of Midwich falls unconscious at the same time... wind up impregnated by what the characters later learn (obvious to the audience) are alien children...Who are the best thing going, especially the leader played by an icy-cold Lindsey Haun, with a penetrating expression of experience and cunning, and she's more worthy to fear than the one good kid is to sympathize with...And it takes a VILLAGE to feature cult icon Mark Hamill of STAR WARS fame as a preacher who seems more possessed by bad acting than the children are by the unseen/whispering wraiths...As for the once ""Master of Horror"" Carpenter - where there should be urgency there's malaise, and the 1990's computer effects, meant to enhance the children's powers, are so distracting you'd think there never was a JURASSIC PARK or TERMINATOR 2 to pave the way...What's the most fun, while resembling the kind of self-aware camp fest this ultra-serious nosedive could have used more of, is how the kids march around the woodsy, seaside small-town like possessed ducklings...Carpenter tosses in a few humorous adult-reactions to these walking, stalking, talking encyclopedias. Meanwhile, his soundtrack has the usual ominous backbone but is constantly interrupted by an acoustic guitar that never quite finds a riff.There IS the usual horror genre body count (Carpenter regular George ""Buck"" Flower as a surly, boozing school janitor is a standout) and a few cheap shock moments, seeming more intended to wake up the audience than to provide suspense for the characters/cast within...Rounded out by CROCODILE DUNDEE ingenue Linda Kozlowski married to EDDIE AND THE CRUISERS Michael Pare, and of course there's a stranger in town, Kirstie Alley, a government agent keeping a secret from the wickedly inquisitive children...But it's her sporadic connections with Reeve, the town's good doctor/reluctant hero, that belongs in a better movie than this science-horror remake that Carpenter didn't have his heart in since his soul is nowhere to be found.",Village of the Damned
41,Samiam3,A few good scenes in an otherwise lousy entry from Carpenter,5,7 May 2010,"I find it a little difficult to pass judgement on remakes when I haven't seen the original. Personal belief aside however, I look at Village of the Damned and I see a creepy story, but one that is a quite devoid of life, and featuring flat characterization and a clumsy narrative. Every now and then, the movie throws a shocker at us, but it is never shocking enough to qualify as a good payoff for having to endure the overly long boring sequences that lead up to it.The curtain rises on a small prairie town, it is a bright sunny morning as the community prepares for an annual celebration. Then all of a sudden everyone drops dead (or do they?). After a few hours they all wake up again and every women in town is pregnant. They all give birth on the same night. The children start growing at an incredible rate, and they possess a telekinetic power which may pose a threat town only the town but the world.Village of the Damned lacks the atmosphere, tension and a sense of surrealism which can be seen in all of Carpenter's previous films. Even the couple movies of his which I find unwatchable have a little sense of creativity to them. If you take a little time to sit and reflect on the movie, I suppose you mind find something interesting about Village of the Damned, but I would say that this Carpenter movie is a bore.",Village of the Damned
42,davidmvining,Missing the Point and the Horror,3,21 September 2021,"Ugh...just...it's hard to believe that John Carpenter, who took the duties of remaking Howard Hawks' The Thing from Another World and executed so well could remake another 50s science fiction film and fall on his face so thoroughly. Carpenter has gone on to say that he took this job as merely a paycheck, but his comments from the time show a surprising enthusiasm for the project, revisiting another childhood favorite film. I think some of my problems with this extend to the source material (though I've never read the original book The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham or seen the original film by Wolf Rilla), but there's a really brief move from the first to second act that feels like its missing twenty minutes of really important stuff. That missing material undermines everything that comes later, creating an empty bit of spectacle that fails to impress on any level. It ends up feeling shockingly pedestrian.The town of Midwich in northern California is a quiet community of a few hundred people, and they're mostly gathering together at the school to help raise funds for a bus. Everyone within the town borders blacks out for about six hours leaving only the town doctor, Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve), free from its affects since he's gone one town over to see someone. His wife, and everyone else is unconscious until everyone miraculously wakes up with no seeming side effects other than a handful of people who died because of where and how they fell. Everything seems fine, though the NSF scientist, Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley), showed up immediately and seems to know something about what happened.Weeks go by, and it turns out that ten women are all pregnant, with their start date all the date of the blackout. These are a mixture of married and single women, and there's even a woman whose husband had been in Japan for a year. This opening is fairly effective and the start of a better movie than what we eventually get. There's an underlying sense of unease about what's going to happen because the event defies any kind of explanation. Then all ten births happen, and the movie begins skipping ahead.I would be surprised if the original novel didn't include the idea of all ten children looking essentially alike with identical silver hair and wearing similar clothes, but I kind of think it was a mistake. I understand the effort to set them apart from regular kids in an easily identifiable way, but I think the horror of kids being that obviously different from normal kids (of which there are pretty much none in the film) undermines the basic idea of something that should be innocent turning out evil. I think they should have looked like normal kids, is what I'm saying. Yes, there are explanations for it (something about DNA being the same like they're all siblings meaning that they are purely implants and not actually the children of the women), but I just don't think it makes for good horror.Another thing about this film that I think undermines the horror is the setting. The remote town is good, but setting it in the modern day prevents the little town from feeling too remote from the rest of the world, and into this comes a representative of the federal government. I don't think it helps that Kirstie Alley, an actress I have no issue with, doesn't feel right for the kind of no-nonsense government employee who's willing to break ethical rules to get what she wants. She just doesn't have the right conviction, but that's not the big problem. The problem is that the town is remote, so it should feel like these people are dealing with this issue alone. Having a federal government employee there to eventually explain a bunch of stuff doesn't allow for that remoteness to stay feeling remote. Having Dr. Verner there makes things feel more normal.Now, that's all an issue, but my biggest problem is the waving away of the first ten years or so of the children's lives. We get one quick scene where one child convinces her mother to put her hand in boiling water before using her weird powers to convince her mother to jump off a cliff. There's no real time dedicated to getting these parents emotionally tied to their children, no matter how alien they may end up being. I think that lack of attachment is really weird, and it makes the final half of the film feel off. The complete lack of attachment, after a pretty decent first act that built up most of these parent characters, doesn't feel right. Most of the parents end up falling off the face of the movie anyway, and the few that do stay around have so little screentime that their sudden change in attitudes from the beginning are jarring at best. There's real whiplash in the second half that the movie never gets over.Another problem is the children themselves. Beyond their look (which I don't like), they're surprisingly unthreatening. Now, that may be a weird thing to say about a movie predicated around children with psychic powers that force people to suicide themselves, but the manifestation of these powers is surprisingly reactive. They don't go around finding people to screw around with. They mind their own business, and then the janitor comes up and starts threatening them, eventually hitting one of the face, and they then force him to commit suicide. Is it too much? Of course. Is it the work of a movie antagonist that needs to be blown up with dynamite? I'm not so sure. It's made all the murkier by the fact that the children remove themselves from the town to live in a remote barn with the explicit goal of not interfering with humanity. This is a mess of an ending.There's more going on, but it ultimately leads to little beyond a stinger for a potential sequel that never materialized. This movie is just a disaster of a film. The horror never connects. The characters fall apart completely. The storytelling is unclear. A promising if unspectacular opening act just spills into confused nonsense for the last hour, and there's nothing to really recommend. This is Carpenter's worst film by far up to this point in his career. Thankfully, he could never possibly reach this low again. Right?",Village of the Damned
43,MartianOctocretr5,Village of the illogical remake,3,17 September 2006,"A mysterious and eerie opening start this movie on the right track: every living thing within a few miles radius of a town's (symbolically name Midwich) center is inexplicably put to sleep simultaneously, for exactly six hours.Christopher Reeve is a local MD who discovers women all over town have become pregnant, even some who had unsuccessfully tried to have children in the past. Kirstie Alley is a (ready for the cliché?) government scientist who wants to study the children. Reeve is good as the amiable and respected doctor, Alley is also good as the scientist whose intents are shady and suspicious, but the best performance of all is Lindsey Haun, leader of the malevolent children. Unfortunately, the fine acting and sinister opening of the film fall victim to a script that unravels.The children's mannerisms are, at times, frightening evil, but at other times, they come off as burlesque. The marching in military order looks absurd. The robotic speech replete with multi-syllabic pseudo-intellectualism and other traits, has been used before. And why in heck doesn't anybody get suspicious when the kids that were conceived during a ""blackout"" all have albino hair and sparkly eyes? Also does it take a genius to notice that people are dying all over the place? Nobody takes any action at all, and instead assures these murderous thugs ""how much they are loved."" The surprises promised by the opening never materialize, doomed victims have ""I'm about to get killed"" stamps all over their faces, and the ending is a rehashed idea that shows an absence of creativity. These and other illogical plot blunders starting about 1/3 way through the story comically undermine any scariness or entertainment value. It gets boring and clichéd. See the original version instead.",Village of the Damned
44,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Amazing Movie,10,2 July 2014,"This eerie film isn't your typical ""murderer on the loose"" film. It provides horror by raising that question we all avoid... are there beings superior to us out there, and would they view us as equals, or would we be treated like cattle to them, useless creatures in the way? It starts off with Midwitch, a small town with charm and a tight-knit community. When everyone within the town faint during a school picnic one day, it intrigues the National Science Foundation, especially Dr. Verner, a stern and headstrong scientist who secretly knows what is happening but she doesn't let on. The local sheriff claims confusion; there is no industrial chemical plant nearby or anything that could knock out a whole town... when everyone wakes up, three have died, including the husband of the school principal. She is shocked and overjoyed to discover several weeks later that she is pregnant... but all the women, even ones who have never tried to have a child, are pregnant as well, and every pregnancy dates to the day of the strange fainting spell.When the children are finally born, they are all similar in appearance, white hair and hostile blue eyes, pale faces and uniform gray clothes. One of the babies is born dead, from the teenage mother who was a virgin although somehow she conceived a baby. Verner steals it for an autopsy, and in a deep depression the would-be-mother kills herself.The children, especially the leader, Mara, are all intellectually superior to the adults, don't play like the other kids in town do, and they are always around during a tragic death. They can control minds, Verner knows this, and confides in the town doctor that these kids are not from earth but are some race unknown to humanity. Only David, the principal's son, shows signs of emotion; there may be hope for him.This film is thrilling to the end, I saw it on TV once and loved it. The acting of the children is so good it's scary, likely the effect wanted, and the soundtrack is eerie yet beautiful. Every actor did a great job. I wouldn't suggest kids should watch it; there are disturbing scenes such as an unborn dead child, Dr. Verner cutting herself open with a surgical knife, a woman setting herself on fire and a priest shooting himself. If you're a fan of alien movies though, or movies about beings with psychic powers, this movie is a great one to try.",Village of the Damned
45,mentalcritic,"Not bad, not good, just average...",5,16 October 2004,"If my summary doesn't tell you anything about the quality of this effort, then hang your head in shame. A film directed by John Carpenter should not be average. It should stay in your mind long after you've finished viewing it for a good reason. This is, after all, the man who directed such classics as They Live, Big Trouble In Little China, and The Thing that we're talking about. Normally, when I see his name on the director's credit, I expect big things out of the film.The problem here is that the whole production has a very made for television feel to it. The effects, while very high-rent and solid in their execution, feel very much like they were designed to plug up holes in the story. The iris effects are an excellent example. The writing staff, unable to think of a more subtle and effective method of demonstrating that these children have unnatural powers that enable them to convince people to do terrible things, overutilise these psychedelic iris effects to a point that would be comical if it didn't feel so childish.The cast has a very low-rent, daytime television feel to it, too. While Christopher Reeve had made himself synonymous with the Man Of Steel to such an extent that the idea of the Superman films being remade seems like Hollywood's ultimate blasphemy, a look at his resumé in front of the camera on other films gives the impression that he was just another B-list actor who caught a very lucky break. Linda Kozlowski is famous for being the straight arrow in a very stereotypical comedy series about a type of individual that hasn't really existed in the English-speaking world since the dawn of mass media. You could put clips of her in those films next to clips of her in this film, and, set decoration aside, not be able to tell them apart. Mark Hamill provides us all with a dose of that patented Christian Love () by telling us how these children have no souls, aren't like us and therefore must die, and so forth. Surprisingly, he delivers the most believable and credible performance in the entire film, even if he does look a bit worse for wear.The redeeming factors in this adaptation are another masterful score from Carpenter, combined with the kind of closed-open ending that Carpenter has been famous for ever since The Thing. Instead of the typical ""they all died, the end"" ending that is characteristic of lesser horror films, Carpenter stimulates the viewer's imagination by giving it some room to move in. I mentioned the scoring for a good reason, too. Carpenter also has the ability to make the human voice seem like something other than a useless tack-on, as opposed to 99.99 percent of the RIAA's output. The intonal humming of the choir during the closing credits theme will stick in your memory long after you've forgotten the film. It makes the barnyard siege sequence in particular stand out more than it really deserves.I gave Village Of The Damned a five out of ten. With a different cast and a better writer, it could have earned a ten out of ten. It is one of the few films with a score that I'd like to own on compact disc when I couldn't give a toss for the film itself.",Village of the Damned
46,ODDBear,Indifference to violence,7,2 June 2005,"John Carpenter's remake of the 1960 original has little to add but it's more violent and explicit. The plot is the same; 10 women get pregnant simultaneously during a group pass out. Several years go by and the children all look similar and stick together. They appear to be anything but normal and once they start killing the residents of the small village it's clear they have to be stopped.Carpenter is really a master of suspense and some scenes work remarkably well, however this is not one of his best films. Not much happens here and the film drags a bit, plus the inclusion of a government intervention and a possible world wide epidemic of these children does little to further the film. Still, Carpenter manages to create a decent amount of suspense and uneasiness by playing on the film's simple premise; that little children are the evildoers here. The soulless stares and glowing eyes are enough to creep you out. The social statement about people (and children) becoming indifferent to violence is a valid input, since the film couldn't really go for the same underlying meaning as the original, which was made during the cold war; the children personifying the threat from the east penetrating the west.An average John Carpenter film is still a lot more interesting than most other horror films out there.

Nothing less is to be expected of John Carpenter.The late Christopher Reeve (1952-2004) gives a solid performance as the local doctor and all around nice guy protagonist Dr. Alan Chaffee, who unfortunately is the father of the ringleader of the evil hell-spawn children. Sadly, this was his last theatrical film before he was paralyzed below the neck in the notorious horse riding accident. Not to be overly sentimental with my praise, but he really was an underrated actor.Interestingly, in addition to featuring Superman/Reeve, Mark Hamill, AKA: Voice of the Joker and also everyone's favorite Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, also appears as an ill-fated priest along with former Vulcan vixen Kirstie Alley as an FBI agent keeping an eye on the evil little bastards.",Village of the Damned
48,jluis1984,Good Old School Film-making,7,16 November 2005,"John Carpenter, a respected director among the horror genre enthusiasts, gives us a remake of the classic 60's sci-fi /horror movie. Many people consider it the weakest Carpenter movie, but now, almost 10 years later, it's easy to notice why this movie was considered a failure in it's time, and certainly it's easier to appreciate it for what it is: an old school horror movie.A year before Scream gave new life to the genre, this movie told the story of a small village lost in the rural areas of the U.S. where something strange happened one afternoon when the entire town fell unconscious. By strange circumstances 10 women got pregnant that day, but only 9 children survived. The remaining children look all the same and behave in strange ways, creating horror in town. All this while a government team studies them.Christopher Reeve stars as the father of the leader of the children, Mara. Co-star Kirstie Alley as the government scientific in charge of the study. To be fair, the acting of the children was superb, while the acting of the adult characters was somewhat weak. Reeve steals the show, and Alley just seems out of place.As I wrote before, the whole movie has that early 80's feeling, and I would dare to say that it feels as something made for TV. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's probably the main reason this movie is not very popular. This old school style maybe was not very attractive for 95's audience, Carpenter would go in a better direction once reunited with Kurt Russell in 96's Escape From L.A.I have not seen the original movie yet, so I came to it without any expectation, I can't say I ended pleased, but I found it entertaining, although quite slow at times.It's worth to notice that it has beautiful cinematography, and even when it may be a flawed effort, it's worth a rent.

More graphic violence, longer discussions about the phenomenon: isn't the tension better if we are left to let the violence grow in our global experience, not just as artifacts of the story? Dozens of cops, soldiers, firemen... and the token government scientist blinded by her outstanding research: this is no longer a small village cut from the world, this is a disaster movie set.I can't understand the urge for Carpenter to shoot such a bad script while the original story and adaptation must have been way better.",Village of the Damned
50,ersinkdotcom,Feels like the iconic director was going through the motions,7,18 April 2016,"""Village of the Damned"" doesn't have that John Carpenter quality we've come to expect from the director's more ""personal"" projects. The passion we see in his remake of ""The Thing from Another World"" is all but absent here. I don't get a sense of emotional attachment to the source material like I do for Howard Hawks' original 1951film. Maybe that's because I've read and seen interviews with Carpenter and his production partner where they admitted they were less than enthused to take on the movie and had ulterior motives. Since ""Village of the Damned"" was made before the CGI craze hit Hollywood, we get a lot of practical and traditional special effects. Director Carpenter features not just one, but two burned and charred bodies for horror enthusiasts to enjoy. The visual effects of the children's eyes are also a treat to look upon.John Carpenter shares the responsibility of the musical score for ""Village of the Damned"" with The Kinks' singer, songwriter and guitarist Dave Davies. The combination of these two talents makes for an eclectic soundtrack. Let's just say it's not quite as menacing as what we've come to expect when sitting down to watch Carpenter's productions. John Carpenter's ""Village of the Damned"" isn't necessarily a bad movie. It just feels like the iconic director was going through the motions. Almost like he really didn't have any personal stakes in creating something that would stand the test of time like his own ""Halloween"" or ""The Fog.""

The general attitude is, ""Hey...they may have made five other people kill themselves, but that's not going to happen to me.""

He can't seem to decide what tone to strike, blending, for instance, moments of intentional camp (as when villagers literally march down the streets with torches and pitchforks like a 1930s Universal horror film), bland moments of social or ideological commentary (as when the women are given the option to have abortions), a long and violent gun-oriented action sequence which would seem more at home in a gangster movie. Additionally, the makeup used with the kids is ridiculous, and substantially detracts from any creepiness they might exude. Furthermore, the editing is unimaginative and the score probably Carpenter's least interesting of all. As much as I hate to say it, being a true Carpenter fan, this movie is not on par with his other work, nor even in comparison to other low-budget horror films of the era.

Village of the Damned, on the other hand, is simply above average at best. Though it does possess some genuinely creepy scenes and the child actors are rather good, the cheap feel, regardless of a sizable budget ($22,000,000 in '95 is about equivalent to about $30+ million today), makes it feel far too much like a TV movie instead of the feature that it was. The performances are apt, and Reeve put forth his good effort as usual. . . but, something about the combination of all the elements just simply didn't make it a very good movie.

For anyone who has seen the 1960 masterpiece by the same name, it will. But wait, there's a new twist here: seems the Super Secret Government wants the women to carry their children to term, and will pay them well if they do. Oooh, scary!Where the original ""Village of the Damned"" delves deep into the emotions of a terrified small town in England, this remake barely skims the surface. It's a superficial attempt at best, and the lackluster cast doesn't help much. Christopher Reeve takes over the George Sanders role, and doesn't do much with it, to be perfectly honest. Hey, he was a great Superman - no argument there - but watching him try to play a dramatic role just made him look severely constipated as well as making me feel terribly sorry for him. Kirstie Alley is the head of the Big Bad Scientific Government Thingie, and she's plays her role like Rebecca from Cheers with a lab coat on: ice-cold, devoid of emotion and totally unlikable. She dies a horrible death at the hands of the creepy kids and deserves every minute of it. Mark Hamill is here too, playing a kind priest with a dumpy wife, and Meredith Salenger is the virgin who miscarries and spends the rest of the film carrying a bottle of booze around. Generation X much? But wait, there's still more twists and stuff! Seems that Christopher Reeves unearthly daughter is the leader of the unholy children, and Michael Pare's (whatever happened to him, anyway?) ""son"" has inherited some human weaknesses, like compassion, and doesn't really want to be evil like the other kids. Wow, all of a sudden, it's a Sci-Fi After School Special. Of course, the kids must be destroyed and Superman - er, Christopher Reeve - has to do it, but what about the Nice Little Boy and his devoted mother? Who cares?This isn't a very good remake, sadly. It concentrates more on gore than plot, thereby robbing itself of any credibility it was hoping to establish. After a nice opening shot of the Unseen Presence gliding in over the coast of California, any attempt at a spooky mood is abandoned, which is a real shame because I know for a fact that Carpenter can do Spooky when he wants to, and do it well.

John Carpenter has never been a director to master the art of understatement, and maybe that's why this movie is such a pale shadow of the 1960 version.The best parts of this film are those that mirror the original. But since the remake was made in the 1990s, Carpenter could throw in grueling childbirth scenes, boiling arms, barbecuing heads, a grisly shootout, an alien baby that looks like one of those 1960s troll dolls in a bottle, and of course, the option of abortion for parents who don't want to go through with their strange pregnancies. In 1960, the idea of an alien ""virgin birth"" was left understated; Carpenter gives us pregnant women in white robes reaching for the heavens. What happened to the original eerie emphasis on how fast the children grew? I don't recall any mention of that in the remake; in fact, Alley mentions how long she has been observing the children.The most misbegotten idea of all was the addition of Kirstie Alley and the subplot involving government agents SUPPORTING the alien children. And out of nowhere, in a town that seems vaguely Episcopalian (with emphasis on the 'alian'), a wild-eyed bunch of torch-waving fundamentalists appear to confront the children. All we're missing is a fat burgomeister in lederhosen.The eyeball effects are good, adding color change to the original glow (which effect, by the way, still stands up in the B/W version). There are no glaring problems with casting or acting either; this was just an unnecessary and uninspiring remake of a classic film.",Village of the Damned

Carpenter proved with the masterpiece The Thing that he could make an excellent remake, but this is not a very interesting film.Some of the stuff with the evil children manages to be somewhat creepy, but overall this film just didn't manage to engage me very much.I haven't seen the original Village of the Damned, maybe I wouldn't like that one either.5 out of 10.",Village of the Damned
59,patriciogl10,Those eyes...,7,15 September 2018,"This is a remake of the 1960 movie of the same name, but it has added value: it was directed by John Carpenter. So, in a small village one day everybody suddenly faint at the same time; but when they wake up, all the women
are pregnant. Nine months later, all the children are born and quickly they grow to wreak havoc with their body-controlling and mind-reading abilities. The platinum-haired children simply do as they please, their ultimate goal is to expand their colonies across the globe and will get rid of anyone standing in their way trying to oppose them.Such an interesting concept all-around. The film features great acting performances by the late Christopher Reeves (in his final performance before his accident), Kirstie Alley, Mark Hamill, and specially Lindsey Haun
as Mara and Thomas Dekker as David (I recognized him from Seinfeld). Carpenter really knows how to set the atmosphere; in the beginning there are several characters introduced and quickly you get the ""small village""
vibe. Some parts reminded me of Twin Peaks, especially the amount of characters and their interactions. The look of the children, their outfit and hair was phenomenal, it is one of the things you instantly remember about this movie, and of course the effect of their eyes when using their power.I gotta say, I wasn't blown away by this movie, but I did liked it and enjoyed it. I prefer John Carpenter's other films, like Escape from New York, The Thing and They Live. Nevertheless, it is highly regarded by a lot of people who saw it in their youth and that has a special value, I completely relate to that.Take your chance on this film; is not Carpenter's best but enjoyable nonetheless.",Village of the Damned

61,Toronto85,Village of the Damned (1995),6,22 June 2011,"In the small town of Midwich, women give birth to alien children in the 1995 version of Village of the Damned. It follows the same story from the 1960 film. One day, everyone in Midwich falls unconscious and it is a complete mystery to scientists and doctors. Soon after, many women in the town become pregnant. There is just one problem. They have no idea who the fathers are. That's because these aren't regular babies. These are babies from outer space.There are many differences between this one and the 1960 original. The level of blood/gore is obviously higher as is the body count. There are also some nice added touches to the original story. I like the discussion of abortion in the remake. Obviously in 1960, that wouldn't be a topic brought up in a major motion picture. In 1995, that is an obvious solution to having an ""alien"" baby growing inside of you. The government also bribes the parents of the babies, three thousand dollars if they agree not to abort the babies. A nice touch in the film to give reason as to why none of the people chose to get rid of their baby.I liked this modern version Village of the Damned. John Carpenter is one of the best horror/sci-fi directors, and he does bring the goods in this one. The acting is just okay. I thought Kirstie Alley was miscast as the smart scientist/doctor. I think she would have better suited the role of one of the parents instead. But all in all, it was just okay. The children are creepy just like the original as well. One child though shows human emotion, which separates him from the others. I liked the addition of that in the movie too.If you liked the original check this one out, it can't hurt. It is a pretty decent modernized version.6/10",Village of the Damned

I can't see where the rating R is at in this movie. There is hardly any bad language. There is barely any blood. There is a little action. There is nothing to claim it to be rated R. I can name another movie done the same ""Dead Silence"". I can the ones making the ratings making stupid mistakes, but that stupid is really stupid.Almost about as dumb as having rated PG-13 horror movies, and saying they are horror. I can sit through every single PG-13 wanna be called horror movies, and pretty much fall asleep through them. That is how sad those Directors are. They want to go towards wider range of people. When then call them thrillers, because that is really what they are. Thrillers are for chillers, and horror is for gore. I am sick of good Ole horror movies that have the gore to go with the horror are getting terrible ratings while the lame PG-13 chillers are getting better ratings.I will say it until I die, that those PG-13 so called horror that are really chiller thrillers should never be called horror. Just the claim is dumber than snot. As for the gore, it isn't real blood or guts. Its all fake. So if you can't handle it something is wrong with that person, not the movie.

63,a.lampert,Disappointing Re-make,4,9 October 2021,"I saw John Carpenter's name as director and Christopher Reeve as the star and was quite looking forward to this well known story. I'd read the book called The Midwich Cuckoos and seen the original film with George Sanders decades ago but couldn't remember much apart from the creepy white haired kids. How disappointing was this inferior remake. Chris Reeve, Kirsty Alley, Linda Koslowsky and Mark Hammill do their best but as soon as I saw those white silky wigs on the kids I despaired of it ever having any tension. The direction looks flat like a TV movie from the seventies, not a mid-nineties movie. There is no sense whatsoever of any tension or horror as billed. There are reasonably good explosions and some violent scenes that are adequately filmed but that's it. The kids aren't scary at all like they are supposed to be and the build up to the point where the authorities say the situation is out of hand just isn't effective at all either. The special effects rely purely on the kids eyes lighting up and glowing, very lame. Avoid and try to find the original or read the book by the author of Day Of The Triffids.",Village of the Damned
64,joshi_3592,"The best remake by John Carpenter since ""the Thing"".",9,24 September 2009,"I had heard a lot of bad reviews about this film, but I think it was a great Carpenter film. I haven't seen the original, but I really liked this one. This is the second remake by Carpenter that I've seen and just like ""the Thing"" this movie really has a creepy atmosphere. This movie will keep your heart pounding at the end, it also had some of the greatest suspense I've ever seen.The movie is about a small town which has an complete blackout. Every woman, man and animal falls asleep for six hours. A few month later all the women realise they're pregnant. The all give birth to strange children with seemingly no emotions and white hear. After many suicides and self wounding related to being alone with the children, a government scientist start suspecting something supernatural with the children. I don't want to ruin the fun so I'm gonna stop here and leave the rest for you.Like most john Carpenter films this is an exiting and creepy film, which keeps you interested at the end. Only problems were the middle section were a little slow, about ten minutes of the film was a little boring. but hey that's it, ten minutes. Also I must admit it did lack some of that humour often in Carpenter films, but i guess that wasn't supposed to be here after the children got into the picture, so i can't really complain about that.Simply said, this is not Carpenters best, but far from his worst. it keeps your attention going, it's very creepy, and the ending was very good. My verdict is 9/10.",Village of the Damned
65,Minus_The_Beer,The Kids Aren't Alright,5,14 September 2010,"The 90's weren't too kind to writer/director John Carpenter. After pioneering the slasher genre in the late 70's and redefining the marriage of sci-fi and horror in the 80's, he was met with flop after flop, with each successive film receiving a smaller budget than the last. Enter ""Village of the Damned,"" a little-seen remake of the 1960 film based on the novel by John Wyndham. While Carpenter's mark is clearly made, the director's frustrations can't help but ooze through in this serviceable yet underwhelming thriller.A sleepy small town is knocked out only to find its female residents (apparently all 10 of them) inexplicably knocked up. To terminate or not to terminate, that is the question. When a chain-smoking scientist (a pre-weight gain Kirstie Alley) offers the women a cash bonus in exchange for seeing their pregnancies through, they ignorantly accept. Unfortunately, the little tykes grow up to be little Hellraisers in need of a good spanking. They are mean to their parents, they defy anyone who gets in their way and worst of all, they manage to look sort of cute in doing so. Even Superman himself (Christopher Reeve is his final film role) proves to be no match for the toxic tots, as the film caps off with a match of wits that is, well, child's play.In spite of his low budget, Carpenter makes the best of things. Quite possibly the director who is best at making something out of nothing, our hero replaces heavy gore with carefully placed sound effects, effective musical cues and other things best left to the imagination. In one scene, a woman's hand is forced into a boiling pot of water to the point where her arm looks like a giant hot dog. Although we never see it really happen, it's one of many moments in the film that will have you squirming in your seat, imagining things far worse than what's on screen. That's the brilliance of John Carpenter, and why ""Village of the Damned"" isn't quite the dud it's been made out to be all these years. Sure, it's got hammy performances all around (Mark Hamill in particular plays it up as the town priest) but it's still an interesting little film that goes to show that even at his lowest point, John Carpenter can run circles around everyone else.",Village of the Damned
66,mitchell5954,Not One Of Carpenter's Strongest Flicks!,6,30 October 2013,"Village of the Damned is one of those films that has everything going for it but does not quite live up to its potential. It is definitely not one of John Carpenter's stronger films. The film is not bad because there are definitely many good points to it, but also quite a few not so good points. This film has a great premise. The cast was great and the effects were pretty decent. I will say the beginning and the ending are both great and suspenseful. However, the middle portion is the factor that really brings the film down.The movie stars the late Christopher Reeve as Dr. Alan Chaffee, Kirstie Alley as Dr. Susan Verner, and Mark Hamill in a small role as the village priest. The story is as follows. One day, in a small village called Midwich everyone suddenly collapses. They wake up not knowing what happened. A couple days later it is revealed that all of the village women have become pregnant at once. The babies grow at an exponential rate. They discover that the babies are of extraterrestrial origin. Even the government gets involves to uncover this mystery. The babies are born and grow very quickly in a few weeks or months. These children all have white hair, little personality, and have the ability to ready and control people's minds. Eventually they mind control people to have them commit suicide. Now it is up to Christopher Reeve to stop them.Again the film starts out great where you have the whole village suddenly losing consciousness. They, along, with the audience, are trying to figure what could have caused that. Then you have every woman in the village getting pregnant. This is all really interesting. What could have caused this, and what is their intention? Then at the end you have a fun sequence where the military comes in to deal with the children. The children then take control of all of their minds and force them to kill each other. That was a very fun scene with great production value. There are even some decent kills during the middle.However, the middle portion I found to be very boring and lackluster. Most of the middle is focused on the children, how different and inhuman they are, and the village and government debating on what to do with them. There was barely and horror, tension, action, or anything like that. I just did not care and found myself almost falling asleep. Mark Hamill's character gets killed off in a stupid way during the middle as well, which annoyed me. I am a fan of Mark Hamill, so I did not like him being killed off so early. There are some decent kills by the children here and there, but not enough for me.Also we never find out what these children really are, where they came from, and why they are doing this. We know that they hate humans, but we do not know why. All the questions that I had during the beginning of the film were never addressed. This is why I do not think this movie quite lived up to its potential.Overall, Village of the Damned is not bad, but was a bit disappointing. If you are a fan of John Carpenter and his other works then give this a look. Just do not expect something on the level of Halloween, The Thing, The Fog, etc.",Village of the Damned
67,The-Social-Introvert,Quickie Review: Village of the Damned,5,24 August 2015,"Village of the Damned was made well into the I'm-tired-and-I-just- don't-give-a-damn-anymore stage of Carpenter's career. Like The Ward 15 years later, it feels so bland and pointless. What is there to gain from watching this film? It's not scary. It's not funny. And it certainly doesn't make use of a cast that includes Christopher Reeve (in his last role before he was paralyzed by falling off his horse), Kirstie Alley, and Mark Hamill. The direction is lazy, the execution clumsy. The end could leave you pondering on the fate of two of the main characters (one of whom happens to be an inhumane psychic monster- child alien – but don't worry, he's probably a goody now that he lost his sexual partner who became a test tube blob because she was stolen at childbirth by the government after her mother was impregnated by an alien space ghostwait, what?) but by then you'll have dozed off. Flat and tedious, Village of the Damned is a tired product from a fatigued director.Best Scene: The part where everyone in the town faints as a result of the alien-ghost thingies (where they every explained?) is the only good scene in the movie. It also provides a chilling death-by- barbecue.",Village of the Damned
68,midge56,Enjoyable movie. Forget Carpenter.,8,28 March 2013,"This movie is still enjoyable to watch despite Carpenter.In fact, Carpenter had no business entitling this movie as his own since it was not his story or his screenplay in the first place. That was pure, unearned ego on his part as he tries to make his fame by latching onto the brilliant efforts of the original films & writers. Carpenter only added unnecessary, offensive gore to an already great story. The effects on the eyes were good & the extended gov't involvement with more focus on science than paranoia was also a refreshing addition as was the stillborn specimen (but that should have included more details on the lab findings than we got.) The priest character was OK until he became a suicidal gun nut which was ridiculous on too many levels to list. The boiling pot, self evisceration, barbecue, consumption by inferno & ""walking tall"" gun battle were just intolerable gore which added nothing to the movie.The original movie only had the children harming someone who had caused them harm or perceived as intended. This movie had them killing the innocent for no reason. That seriously degraded the story. The original contained unjustifiable gov't paranoia over acts of self-defense. By the killing of innocents such as the mothers suicides which made no sense whatsoever, it justified the paranoia to kill the children. The original idea was the children were unfairly judged because they were different & had unique abilities; acting only in self defense.I did like the survival ending on the new version. That could make an excellent sequel.It is a mistake to remake popular movies like this film, The Omen & Stepford Wives which were already great to begin with. (& never ridicule a cult classic such as was done with Stepford). Only an idiot would take plot change advice from disgruntled complainers instead of fans.It would be OK to colorize BW films and beef up the special effects & sound improvements on the originals for redistribution as was done for Star Wars & Star Trek. Sequels of great cliffhanger films would be much better ideas to pursue if done in the spirit of the original story. But it is a bad idea to redo an original classic verbatim without offering much more to the story. The desire to see more details & missing parts of the stories is what makes deleted scenes so popular with the public. They don't like to be left hanging in the dark. Hence, the need for a sequel on such movies. Not a remake of the same hanging, unanswered questions which offers nothing extra to fans.It would be better to make follow up sequels on these popular stories rather than trying to duplicate the original verbatim with a completely different cast. There's also nothing worse than an actor doing a popular film remake, who refuses to watch the original or a director who makes changes simply to imprint their ego onto it like a dog marking a hydrant.We might like to see what happens if the children survived & learn the source of their origins; as well as endings where they are successful in survival & goals as well as exceptions to their demeanor like David with multi-layered personalities.Classic films should not be used as a venue for some egomaniacal director to headline his name on the title of a movie he didn't write as Carpenter has been repeatedly guilty of doing. Perhaps he should do something original for a change rather than riding on the coat tails of someone else's ideas & efforts.Don't listen to the opinions of people who get off on gore. They are only happy with chainsaw, saw & serial hacking butcher type Jason films with no appreciation for thrilling & innovative story lines.This classic, one of a kind story has captivated audiences for over 50 years since it was first released. So even a glory stealer like Carpenter can't do too much damage to ruin it. So forget Carpenter. The actors did a good job portraying their roles despite his direction.This new version of the movie is still based on the original classic so it is still enjoyable to watch if you use the fast forward to elude the gore scenes.",Village of the Damned
69,MWNiese,Great Adult Cast Paired w/ Annoying Children,6,30 August 2008,"John Carpenter has been one of the few directors to turn in quality horror remakes: This one and the ""Thing"". It is debatable as to whether or not this film truly is a horror movie. In actuality it should be grouped as a science fiction/ suspense. The original was definitely not a horror movie, so Carpenter's version shouldn't be considered as one either. Which is probably why it has such a low rating on this web site and in the film community in general. It seems like people were really let down that Carpenter didn't take the original and throw in gratuitous violence, pointless nudity, and excessive profanity. I'm sorry Carpenter disappointed these Thespians, clamoring for some slit throats.Carpenter's ""Village"" is an intelligent science fiction film. I read several of the negative reviews on this web site and didn't find much sustenance behind them, and confounded my suspicion that people were generally unhappy that it wasn't a blood bath. I don't think it was marketed wrong either. Film goers should have realized, based on the original, that this film wasn't going to be a brainless slasher fest. Oh, and then there are the reviewers that have to mention Carpenter's ""Halloween"" in every single Carpenter movie review. Come on folks, let's try to bring some fresh angles on Carpenter's work besides that it, ""Wasn't as good as 'Halloween'"". Get over it people. Just like Lucas will never make another ""Empire"", Carpenter will never make another ""Halloween"".Perhaps if any one complaint should be lodged, it should be that the film does lack energy. But no film is perfect and even if we don't realize it, we routinely overlook flaws in just about every film we watch. But people just have to hold Carpenter to this ridiculously high performance level. Look, the bottom line is that this is a well produced remake. The cinematography, editing, special effects, sound score, acting, and directing are at the very least slightly above average. If you don't think so, I would really tend to question your true knowledge of quality film production aspects. Carpenter's ""Village"" is much better than any of the drivel horror remakes completed in the 2000s, a decade defined by sloppy attention deficit disorder you-tube remakes.",Village of the Damned
70,bbrasher1,NOT BAD...FOR A REMAKE,7,1 March 2003,"I saw this one when it first came out, then I went to Suncoast video and picked up a copy of the original, which of course, was far better(few would probably disagree with that assessment.) As far as remakes go, it was somewhat faithful to the original, even though the little monsters were more overtly evil-in the original, they displayed absolutely no emotion whatsoever, which made them much creepier than their 1995 counterparts. Thomas Deckker, who bore a striking resemblance to Martin Stephens, who played the head creep in the original VOTD, portrays David, the runt of the litter who doesn't quite fit in with the others because he's just a little too ""human"". Lindsey Haun stands out as Mara, who leads the group on a murderous rampage.Even though this one is not up to the original, it still packs a punch.Similar to JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING, the monsters are virtually indestructible, not because they can't be destroyed by conventional weapons, but with their ability to read minds, or, as in the case of THE THING, where the title fiend is able to assume the identity of anyone or anything it chooses-it makes for an unnerving viewing experience.Sadly, this was Christopher Reeve's final role before his tragic accident.Rating: ***1/2 out of *****",Village of the Damned
71,Erewhon,"Not merely bad, but terrible",3,13 October 2004,"John Carpenter has made more bad movies than he's made good, but this would be a leading candidate for his very worst. Despite excellent photography and use of color on misty California coastal locations, despite a very good performance by Christopher Reeve, this reeks.The script by David Himmelstein (etc.) repeats some of the main story points of the first film; every change from the original is not just a mistake, but a catastrophe, other than the shift to an American locale. First, we never know the origin of the children; a whispering shadow passes over Reeve at the beginning of the film, but that is, shall we say, less than illuminating regarding the origin of the children.In the original, the children develop in the womb much faster than normal, and continue this accelerated aging after birth. No mention is made of this in Carpenter's version. In the original, it's clearly and explicitly demonstrated that the children have a shared mind--here we're simply told they do--there's very little evidence for this and some AGAINST this idea, as with David, the ""good"" kid among the Midwich children. (Speaking of children, although we're shown that the town has lots of regular kids, once the ""dayout"" children are born, we never see a single normal child again.)Kirstie Alley is awful, but it's not entirely her fault; her part is all over the place, at first a scheming villain who later becomes semi-sympathetic. Just what she's doing in the story is never made clear. Nor is much of anything else. Thee were lots more women who could become pregnant in the opening scene than who eventually give birth. Bringing in a government representative serves the dopey function of suggesting a conspiracy without actually having to depict it. Killing Reeve's wife early on reduces his connection with the children, but there he is, still in the story.This is a misbegotten mess.",Village of the Damned
72,NicolasCostoglou,Movies are the window to the soul...,10,30 April 2017,"John Carpenter's ""Village of the Damned"" is the second remake of a classic movie he's made after ""The Thing"" and in my opinion as great.I first watched the movie when i was still a little child close to my teenage years and had no idea what it was about, and it hooked me right from the start, because of the hypnotic soundtrack and the great sense of mystery. I recommend everyone who hasn't watched this film yet, to stop reading this, or any other information about it, and to watch it without knowing anything, it's perfect then.The movie is directed masterfully, every scene is well thought out and perfectly shot from director of photography Gary B. Kibbe. Most of the suspenseful scenes are incredibly subtle. Most of the time, it's just the way the scene is lit, or the camera moves, which gives you chills.The movie is also very atmospheric and it get's the right amount of juxtaposition between the village-folk, where everyone knows everyone and you care about all of them, and the terror which will take place through the only thing we thought might be innocent: Our children.The acting is also superb, everyone gives a fitting performance most of all Christopher Reeve and Linda Kozlowsky. But i also have to mention the children: The are fantastic, they act well along with the adult actors and seem very adult themselves. I'm also very impressed that they act flawlessly in long takes, and they never had to cut around their performances.This is also very important, because the actors are what holds the movie together, every scene is focused on them and it's the reason why it's such an intense and suspenseful experience.I also really love that all of the terrifying death scenes and the finale act, aren't just there to show brutal violence, they doesn't show the violence, but the reaction of the characters to it, and that's the reason why you feel the impact of it. The same with the scenes where they try to block the mind powers of the children, and most of all in the finale act, it's masterfully put together and you really feel the intensity, and helplessness of the characters.Lika all of Carpenter's movies, this one also has a double-edged- ending, which is great as always. The protagonist get what they wanted in the end, BUT there is no hope in the future, love it.All in all one of my favourite Mystery-Sci-Fi-Thrillers with great acting, direction, and soundtrack, all the more effective if you don 't know what it's about...",Village of the Damned
73,sampah70,A realization that John Carpenter is just a mediocre director,1,13 September 2018,"For 30+ years I had in mind that the household name John Carpenter (JC, a pun of Jesus Christ the Carpenter?) is an insurance for a quality horror/mistery movies, along with Stephen King, Wes Craven etc. (though I reckon most of Wes Craven movies just his unique/stupid style to scare people).Everytime I watched horror movies, I shut down my brain quite a bit since most of them are rather stupid (and zombie flicks are the most stupid of all), yet most often I still felt cheated by their stupidity. The JC label as director caould make it easier, it biasedly sweeped my doubt out to the outer space,
just like it did with this movie, subconsciously I was forced that this was a quality horror, particularlly with even Superman were starring in it.Then one time I watched (or rewatched, I'm not sure) the original movie which still in black-n-white and directed by Wolf Rilla. It was released in 1960 or some 35 years before this, yet far more artistic beyond this JC's crap.
Even AFTER 35 YEARS! that's mind boggling.This movie made realized that JC was a such a freaking mediocre director and suddenly all his movies I've watched were unmasked, they're no different with bunch other stupid horror jumpscare movies full of cliches, overacting, nonsensical BS for the sake of drama or tried too silly to scare the audience but failed miserably.A 5 year old kiddie can jumpscare you, no skill or budget needed.

74,clh-1,"Not Exceptionally Terrifying, but Worthy of Watching",7,30 October 2005,"I find this film something that although not extremely scary, is very compelling to watch, preferably at night, in the dark, alone. I kept wondering ""What the heck is going on?!?"", which of course kept me watching, as it wasn't the annoying form of confusion but actually a cerebral story in the finest mystery/thriller tradition. Although I wondered why only a few members of the cast could actually develop an ability to mask their thoughts with simple imagery, it stands to reason that we would need a handful of people to be cannon fodder. I also wondered why these supposedly superior beings that could destroy most of civilization would need ""regular"" people to provide for them, when they are so obviously smarter than us. But the film works. I haven't seen the original, so can't make any comparisons, although Black and White is infinitely more terrifying. The cast is exceptional, Christopher Reeve, Mark Hamil, and Kirstie Alley all put forth some very good performances. The film doesn't take the easy way out and just splash gore across the screen for the slack-jaws in the audience. All blood and death is minimal, and used just when the shock is needed most. And enjoyable film to add to your Halloween roster.",Village of the Damned

This movie was a little creepy because the little kids were eerie and it was set in a very small town.  The storyline was pretty interesting, but the acting was a downfall.  I was surprised to see Christopher Reeve in this movie.  I have never seen him in any role except for Superman.  I thought he did a great job in it.  It seemed like this movie was filmed for TV and not for the big screen.  There were some gory parts in it, but all in all I thought that it was not as good as I hoped that it would be.  I think I need to see the original one and compare the two.  I'm glad I saw this movie though.",Village of the Damned

C Reeve did try to give a great performance as did K. Alley and the kids but there was just no hope for this movie from the start. I love John carpenters movies but he did a really poor job with this one. The high light for me was seeing Mark Hamill get killed. He has gotten such a swelled ego since the Star Wars trilogy that he needs to be knocked down a few pegs. in the movie you can see he was there but was not acting so much as hey I am Mark Hamill so I am god, and you will love this movie or my the sith have there revenge on your soul. The movie tried I will give it that but if there was a lower rating then a one on this site I would give it a negative number like maybe a 3 or 4 minus. If for no other reason then they took a classic and ""Damned"" it to a place that nothing should go.

78,Royalcourtier,Misjudged and unsubtle psychological thriller,3,31 July 2002,"The John Carpenter version of the Village of the Damned/Midwich Cuckoos is not a success. A previous reviewer has complemented the director on his original ideas. Unfortunately there are few evident in the film, and most were derived from the original film, or the book.Village of the Damned is of course based on the best-selling book by John Wyndham. Incidentally, it is a work of fiction, and NOT based on a real event. The original film version (1960) was an entirely successful thriller. It fully exploited the potential of the material- the confusion caused by the ""day out""; the fear and trepidation, and in some cases the humilitaion, of the unexpected pregnancies; the realisation that there was something truly unnatural about what was happening; the town trying to adjust to the changing situation; the slowly increasing sense of menace as the children grew older and more assertive; the rising fear as the community realised that the children were not just different, they were dangerous. Little of this development is evident in the 1995 remade.This version was closer to a B-grade horror film. The physical shock elements largely superseded the psychological. Rather than suggesting a slowly rising sense of menace, Carpenter prefers to show a barbicued local. I suppose that this type of film is easier to make.The telepathic connection between the children- indeed their oneness-  was not indicated. In fact the symptoms of humanity shown by David, and his insubordination and eventual flight, are totally at odds with the basic storyline.The actors and acting were variable. The children were generally very good. But many of the adults were either miscast, or acting poorly, or both.There were a number of very odd changes to the story. If the children were afraid of being killed if they remained within an isolated community, why move out of town to a disused barn? This would make it so much easier for the authorities to kill them without hurting the locals. The other communities of ""cuckoos"" were simultaneously killed, so it is immediately expected that the Midwich children will follow. Surely if the US Government had intended to kill them as well they would be attacked at the same time as the other world governments acted.The entire American government and scientific community was represented by one doctor- whose specialisation of epidemiology seemed rather odd. There was apparently no discussion of what the children were- or where they came from- until virtually the end of the film. Their extraterrestrial origins was then only hinted at- courtesy of a suitable gruesome alien body and accompanying ""self-autopsy"" by the doctor.I have to say that this film was a considerable disappointment. A much better result could have been achieved with the material.",Village of the Damned
79,jwtrox08706,Pretty Good Friggin Film,8,24 April 2007,"From the moment the movie started with that tension-building music...I was hooked. These kids mean business. Christopher Reeve had an amazing performance, as usual. Kirstie Alley was okay in this film, but it wasn't an award-winning performance. Mark Hamill did a good job with his character, the minister. Now, on to the children. The standout performances had to have been Lindsey Haun and Thomas Dekker. Lindsey Haun did a wonderful job playing the ruthless leader...and she was only 11. ""You can't stop us, you know. Don't try."" I loved it. And Thomas delivers a heart-warming and sometimes tear-jerking performance (I may be exaggerating a little there), but for an 8 year old (at the time) how can you say his performance wasn't any less than what it should have been for this film and for the character he had to play, and the ending of the film leaves you thinking. All the children are gone, except David (Thomas Dekker). Mara had always said only the fittest survive, and David was the last of the children...he survived. The music left some unresolved tension at the end...is David REALLY not ""one of them"", or was this his survival technique...blend in, show emotion and sneak in through the back door? That was the best part of this film is it leaves you thinking...which is a very common staple for a John Carpenter film...have an ending that leaves loose ends and leaves people thinking about the movie and try to come up with their own resolution, instead of doing the thinking for them. That's why I give John Carpenter's Village of the Damned 8 out of 10 stars.",Village of the Damned
80,Payback1016,I honestly think it's better than the original.,10,11 January 2017,"Don't get me wrong, the original is a great classic and noting can really top that. However the Carpenter remake does take interesting steps that even the writer of the book. For example the stillborn. While much like the first movie, it's no surprise that there have been other Damned kids, whom have been swiftly eliminated. Neither side anticipated the complications that are seen in everyday child-birthing. Not only that but it's handled pretty realistically on all sides. With the mother, she wanted to have the kid in spite of the implications of the conception and the consequences the other parents faced and her denial of that pushed her over the edge. With David whom the child was to be his partner, he is the only one of the Damned that learned about pain and loss and is able to empathize with Reeve's character, who also suffered loss. This in turn caused him to at least try to reach out to the kids in hopes they could feel the same way David feels, which would give both humanity and the Damned a chance to live in peace. I can't help but praise Carpenter for trying to find a grey area, in his remake of a black and white classic.",Village of the Damned

The story, acting and special effects made it a better movie.  I think it was the other way around with his attempt to remake ""Village"".  In the original, the truely terrifying element was children that appeared to be normal children, but weren't.

I really appreciate John Carpenter's directional style, and his direction does make this at least interesting to watch as a fan. Yet, this one is low on style or scares. When he does take the music and style to a high level the movie is certainly best in those scenes. I wish he had spent more time on the style parts of the film and made this a more trademark Carpenter horror film.
The actors are also fine but not great. Reeves does a nice job and I also enjoyed Mark Hamill as the priest, but there just aren't any excellent or extremely likable characters to feel for or care about.

Why wait until the end to see which, if any, of the main characters are left alive? There's no concept of time. The kids grow, but are they growing up in weeks? Months? Years? There's no way to tell. It's just plain old boring.The best part of this movie is the first half hour or so, before the kids actually show up. THEN this movie is a bit creepy, unpredictable, and it even has a couple scenes with some decent shock value.

87,Trampyre,Lost Opportunity...,6,14 February 2006,"What to do when making a film of an allegorical Science Fiction classic novel? Unfortunately, John Carpenter didn't have a clue... The original film version of VILLAGE got most of it pretty right. In one of the paperback versions of the source material THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS was a mini study guide, which proposed questions to many themes in the novel. If only Mr. Carpenter had read these... This version of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED is way too action-oriented... explosions...brutal deaths...hysterical townspeople... ""The Children"" themselves don't really follow the design of author John Wyndham, especially highlighted by ""Mara"", the ""leader"" of this child invasion- she wears EVIL with a capital ""E"" on her face. The children are much more sinister in the original, outstandingly encapsulated by the performance of Martin Stephens, whose blank-faced stance defines ""emotionless"". These pod children become much more sinister and terrifying than Carpenter's brood, who (except for ""David"") read more like Patty McCormack's ""Rhoda"" in THE BAD SEED- their intentions are obviously no good from the beginning, and with LOTS of camp overacting by vets like Mark Hamill, there is nothing scary (or interesting, for that matter) in this remake.

90,catalyst8-1,A Pointless Remake.,2,18 February 2008,"If you haven't seen the original 1960 film, or read Whyndham's 'The Midwhich Cuckoos', then you might possibly like Carpenter's remake. It has degrees of suspense, and passable acting (perhaps most surprisingly by Christopher Reeve in his last performance prior to his paralysis), but these qualities are inconsistent throughout the film and it frequently falls flat.If you've seen the original film then avoid this one, especially if you have read Whyndam's novel too, you will only come away from the experience with a sense of disappointment and feel cheated of the time you invested in watching it. This film lacks many things that the original had - great and consistent acting, tension, and suspense to name but three.There seems to have been a conscious effort to add gore and violence, and that decision is perhaps the main reason this film fails so miserably compared to the original. The gratuitously graphic nature of the violence directly detracts from the suspense and tension so evident in the original. Whereas in another carpenter remake 'The Thing' the effects and violence enhanced the sense of dread, here they are responsible for destroying it.There are other reasons that this film is quite dire, one of them being the narrative compromises made to attempt a recreation of the visual style of the original film e.g. the children all wear matching clothes which, in the original, was logical since in England children do indeed wear school uniforms. However Carpenter's US town sees the children uniformly garbed with no reason, other than to draw attention to their uniformity in a massively clumsy and illogical visual device.Take my advice, watch the original and avoid this. It's one strictly for carpenter fanatics, not people who are simply fans of his work.",Village of the Damned

92,chambara8112,Very Exceptional Moment When a Remake Beats an Original,10,26 December 2004,"There are very few horrors in Hollywood that are truly scary from an adults point of view like this one. it looks almost like it was done by an European contemplating the violence in contemporary America but in fact, it's surprising that was John Carpenter himself who's very well aware of that marginal point of America (frivolity of violence) that is so deeply implied in this movie. So this brainy stuff in horror is one of the aspects why this film didn't make good in box-office.Beginning: i love the way how we are introduced to our essential characters then the family and full of harmony feeling that follows as if we're treated to something romantic, and in one moment everything is destroyed. The black-out scene is so chillingly frightening in a very serious tone achieved especially due to that sweet beginning. What follows is what you actually get and that's a very tragical feeling that something bad is gonna happen which is masterfully directed almost in a non-speakable way. That feel of dread flows through the ""childbirth scene"" that features little flashes of happiness for their characters (for a short time). One of the most beautiful scenes is the ""baptizing of that baby"" showing us our human side in contrast to that inhuman-or should i say extraterrestrial.OK first death scene: brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. From the ""boiling-water scene"" to jumping off a cliff it's almost without words which makes it all the more powerful conclusion. Here i must say i'm a big Carpenter fan and i've seen all his movies but this scene (along with that one at a cemetery w/ Alan Chaffee & David) is one of his most spectacular i have ever seen and only proves that Carpenter is indisputably far better filmmaker than before. After the interrogation with K.Alley we are treated to a beautiful film-montage of the village shifting to a truly majestic scene of the marching children which accompanying an enchanting music with an appropriate sound nuances directly for the children's theme. Second death scene was done in a very old-fashioned style (which is more or less beautiful and disturbing than just frightening), that is important for us just to get to a point when they represent a real threat with complete lacking of any empathy and compassion for others which leads me to mention a cute scene with David learning something about humanity: in that scene you can take David as some kind of a symbol of hope that there still can be a little of humanity or take Linda Kozlowski character as a symbol of a parent that's actually responsible for that humanity to the future, anyway beautiful scene. Interesting moment is the suicide of Salenger's Melanie Roberts character - was she compelled by some outer force (extraterrestrial) or was it her own decision (which doesn't make much sense). There's truly magnificent scene with David and Reeve's character at a cemetery concerning human emotions - i almost thought that i was watching some Jean Cocteau film, and those who say that Garry Kibbe is a low-class cinematographer should see at least this scene, definitely this film is one of his best collaborations with Carpenter. There are many really old-fashioned scenes that were fancy maybe in 50's or 60's but in a way they're still very elegant and impressive, mainly because Carpenter took from those days only what is at its core virtually timeless, so i don't think there's a way that Village Of The Damned could seem to be dated, on the contrary there's a chance that this will probably find its audience in the future! And by the way for a Carpenter film you gotta have an acquired special taste. What i also admire is that carnage scene at the end of the movie which is a really classic Carpenter scene affluent of the rhythm and style similar to 'Assault On Precinct 13'. Anyway going through with this remake is an experience of a life time that the 1960 version by far ain't equal to. I have seen Carpenter's VOTD 8 years ago and still i can't put those images from this film out of my mind, i was really convinced that i was in that village and believed those events were happening, that's something i can't say about a lot of pretentious movies in Hollywood today.I think Carpenter really outdid himself with this very powerful film that not only beats its inferior original but even in its way Carpenter's early stuff like 'Halloween', 'The Thing' or 'Prince Of Darkness'. You know, it's very easy to prefer a film that is shocking and very serious like 'The Thing', but Village Of The Damned is pretty much opulent in his portrayal of violence in a more brooding sense, it's not so much a horror within itself(The Thing) as it is rather a low viewpoint of the true horror outside and about the way how to deal/struggle with that. So from this perspective it very easily transcends something like 'The Thing' but in fact they're both great, even though 'Village Of The Damned' doesn't try to be that extremely documentary-like serious and 'The Thing' doesn't succeed in that intelligent satiric portrayal of violence and old fashioned artistic film beauty.i can't help but this film is simply a true masterpiece that is criminally under-appreciated.",Village of the Damned

94,Top_Cat84,The children save this movie from obscurity,5,21 November 2014,"So in this film a mysterious invisible fog penetrates a small Californian town, making everybody collapse and pass out. When they come to again the women soon realise that they are all pregnant. Despite the fears of having deformed babies they are all persuaded to keep them due to the promise of financial reward. Soon the babies are born and grow up to become murderous little children through their use of mind control.From the children being born to them being of school age happens in the blink of an eye. I suppose this had to be done, but it just seems sloppily executed and a bit disorientating.In one scene all the women have near-religious dreams persuading them further to keep their babies. The effects at this point reminded me of effects in the Ghostbusters franchise, despite being filmed six years after Ghostbusters 2. There appears to have been no advancements in SPX in this period (which I find hard to believe). This being said, I did really enjoy the effects when the little children, with their white make up and blonde hair, started shining their eyes. The imagery of this was perfect for the film.The children in the film act particularly well. Christopher Reeve is good but doesn't get a real chance to shine as his character lacks depth. He's a character who I really wanted to care for but I just couldn't feel that emotionally connected with him. Kirstie Alley adds nothing of note to the film except about thirty cigarettes due to her lighting up in nearly every scene.So, not a complete travesty but I imagine I won't go out of my way to watch it again anytime soon.",Village of the Damned

97,jenkins-stewart,"""Beware the Children""",5,14 December 2007,"Village of the Damned is one of the weakest entries in long line of troubled mid 90's horror films made (or inspired by) King, Carpenter, and Barker. Unlike the cult classics, or camp classics of this era, such as King's television mini-series The Stand, or Carpenter's own Vampires, this film was, and is, a tremendously underwhelming bomb of a movie.Like many other ""hurried"" films of the late 80's and early 90's, the premise of the film and the way in which the premise unfolds in the first few scenes are really the only parts which received any solid production. Watching this reminds me of Cronenberg's ""Scanners,"" not stylistically, but in terms of its quality of ""going flat"" within the first 20 minutes, and then limping along with emptied enthusiasm for the duration. The ending of the film thus requires some sort of explosion if for no other reason than to wake the sleeping audience and inform them that the movie is over.Kirstie Alley gives perhaps the absolute worst performance of her career. Her work here is indescribably bad. I could use a colorful metaphor or clever turn of phrase to poke fun at her performance, but such colorful animosity is undeserved it is simply horrible acting. The work of her fellow actors and actresses, while significantly better, is none the less bland and passionless. It is evident that none of the cast were happy working on this film, especially Reeve. The acting becomes increasingly forced as the plot reaches its climax, with the cast desperately (or perhaps unwillingly) attempting to remain in step with the film's direction. The only thing which propels the plot forward is the formulaic method by which each of the characters is mind-controlled and compelled to commit suicide by the unholy children. This too is not only predictable but also acted very poorly. It is not the psychic children forcing the adults to kill themselves, it is the script, and the director: there is simply no illusion cast.The special effects in this movie are a joke. They are neither so laughably bad as to provide a twisted form of entertainment nor are they filmic in any way. They are rather the quality of those from a 90's made-for-television movie, if not worse. The sets in particular are a grave disappointment warehouses draped with white curtains are used extensively as stand ins for shady government facilities. There is no real gore in this film either, save one brief shot, making it one of the most ""soft-core"" horror films of all time. All the deaths are decidedly un-graphic and un-horrific: violence occurs in-between shots of the death-about-to-happen and the death-having-happened. This film simply cannot scare you it cannot chill you it can barely even hold your attention past the initial stirrings which set the plot in motion. Like the film's cliché score of a child's lullaby (used to great effect in films like Rosemary's Baby, and utterly meaningless here) this movie will put you to sleep.The original Village was a landmark horror film notable for its concept, execution, and camp value. This film serves only as an embarrassing page in a dismal chapter of Carpenter's career: an unmitigated, but ultimately forgettable disaster. The fact that it has received DVD treatment is something of a miracle. You should not buy this film. I hardly suggest that you even watch it, since it is barely even worth your time. I recommend it only to insomniacs or those in need of a mindless distraction. In order to be worth watching a film must be either significantly worse, or better than this. This is mediocrity: there is just nothing remarkable about it. ((50% completion grade: nothing more. Grade F work))",Village of the Damned
98,maxvox-96919,Abysmal clumsy acting and camera work,2,10 April 2019,"Admittedly, I am a big fan of the original 1960 version of this film. But I am not averse to a remake if it at least does a good job with basic film making. This film does not.To wit.1. The characters
An array of ridiculous stereotyped characters like the ""pious innocent-faced young priest"", the stumbling drunk school maintenance man who sneaks nips from a bottle in a paper bag, the chirpy school teachers, the ""Cruella DeVille"" style know-it-all in-your-face ""angry female doctor who knows better"" (Kirstie Alley). Nearly every character in this thing is written as an over-the-top caricature of a real person.2. Acting
Ugh. Even the leads (Alley and Christopher Reeve) turn in unbearable overdone performances.3. Camerawork
I am not sure how to describe this, but many scenes are shot with clumsy close-ups from distracting angles or viewpoints - often below ""level"" looking just slightly up at the actors. It was bad enough that I started being distracted by it.The whole thing really comes off as more a high school film project than you would expect from the likes of John Carpenter. Christopher Reeve and Kirstie Alley are not notoriously ""brilliant"" actors. I mean, Reeve made it big playing an on-screen cartoon character (superman) after all, and Alley is the perennially bossy/frustrated ""Rebecca Howe"" from Cheers. But I would have expected at least passable performances.
---------The story line is largely the same as the 1960 version, albeit with additional gore and explicit display of things that are only hinted at in the earlier film, and a side plot involving the evil intervention of ""the government"". That adds more tension and psychological disturbance to the viewer, which is not a bad thing. But it does nothing for the story.",Village of the Damned

Mind Control has always been the worst thing we imagine alien or artificially created lives could do to us. "" No coexistence possible between the 2 species "" . It's really scary to think that a child can control her mother's mind to make her kill herself, and then destroy mankind. At the same time they are smarter and much powerful they are weaker than mankind because they come in pairs, as we saw with David, David didn't grew as fast as the others because his "" other half"" was missing. Still this is till one of the scariest films ever. I guess that mind control is the only thing I ever feared, and putting this in a movie was an excellent Idea. I mean think a little thing about it, what would be worse? being made slave, being murdered or do something against your will ignoring what you're doing? Loosing all power over your thoughts and body? I think this is an excellent film to tell people that they need to be strong and be able to resist to accept everything without thinking about it. We see it when Mra tries to find out what her "" father"" is thinking of, and despite all the effort she is putting into it he manages to resist.",Village of the Damned
100,angeljuuhachi,best movie i've seen in a while,10,27 April 2002,"Critics didn't seem to like Village of the Damned(1995) but when I asked everybody I know, they all liked it.  Gee, I wonder why.  Village of the Damned is about 9 platinum-white haired children who can control bodies and read minds. Their quest for survival leads to horror and destruction.  There are really good acting performances by Christopher Reeve, Kristi Ally, and Mark Hamil.  The two best ones were Lindsey Haun as Mara and Thomas Dekker as David, two of the main children. Lindsey Haun is stunning in this movie.I don't know if any other child could've pulled off a role like that.  She was emotionless, cold and commanding, yet still beautiful and stylish. She's now 17, and still just as awesome.  Thomas Dekker did good in the middle of emotionless and empathetic .Village of the Damned is not like a slasher movie with tons of blood.  It cuts down yet still looks real. It sends chills down your spine when you watch it, and the glowing eyes are cool.  And like my friend said, ""Even if the entire movie completely sucked, Lindsey Haun would still manage to keep the entire movie awesome.",Village of the Damned
101,DostoyevskyClone,Beware of this bad directorial decision...,3,31 July 2003,"Mr. Carpenter  atmospheric director and brilliant music man  what made you decide to make this movie?  What were you trying to accomplish here??  Did you really think that the children with glowing eyes were scary???  What were we meant to take from this debacle????   Why am I writing a review that's so negative about a John Carpenter movie?????  I'm sorry - this movie wasn't scary, thrilling, entertaining, or thought-provoking.  I felt a dread at the very beginning of this movie when the music started playing and it didn't feel like Carpenter music.  I felt even worse a few moments later when the shadow moved over the landscape  very poor.I'm really sorry Mr. Carpenter  I didn't think I still had the capacity for such cruelty. Ghosts of Mars' was better than this (and I want to say Vampires,' but I still haven't seen all of that yet).",Village of the Damned
102,reelmartin,Gripping,7,17 June 2000,"My mother turned on Village of the Damned one evening because Christopher Reeve was in it.  I knew absolutely nothing about it beyond the fact that there was a movie by that title.  After ten minutes I was completely hooked. After it was over I thought about it and realized there were some flaws, but still, while it lasted I was fascinated.  I recommend it.",Village of the Damned
103,gben,Typically bland remake...,2,8 June 2007,"The original 'Village' from 1960 is a wonderful, eerie slice of British sci-fi. This utter nonsense starring superman does not deserve the credit of being seen. Go and rent the original, remove any preconceptions you may have about old movies, put yourself in the mindset of a cinema goer from 1960 and revel in the quiet charm and ultimately chilling experience that this film delivers. Or you could read the book by John Wyndham 'The Midwich Cuckoos', in fact do anything other than watch this contender for 'Worst Remake Ever'. At least IMDb voters seem to agree - 7.5 for the Brits, 5.3 for the Yanks - this time go with public opinion!",Village of the Damned
104,bridgettecarroll,This is one of my favourite movies,10,2 May 2015,"This is one of my favourite movies, one of the very few horror movies that don't scare me, and I prefer the ending of this over the original movie. I have the book this is based off, and this is one of the very few movies that I can watch more than once without growing bored of it. My favourite part is that David stands out the most (in a good way) among the alien children and he's my favourite character in the movie along with how he can feel empathy and he can understand people's feelings. He has a heart and he's misunderstood, but that was only because the child he was supposed to be paired with died. It's just amazing to me how it became a mixed blessing, even though the death was bad, but it's helped him out in the way that he's portrayed as a good, but misunderstood. I don't have anything negative at all to say about this movie!",Village of the Damned
105,ificouldfly,A UFO passes over a village and all the people black out . Weeks later 10 women are revealed pregnant. The children have powers to make people do what they want...,6,30 December 2007,"I was surprised bad by the film. I wanted to see the filmed Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. Unfortunately there was nothing in common between book and film, besides children . The film has lost all the philosophy that is found in the original story. There are quotes from the book which sound just not in place, when they are not connected with the book's philosophies. Also - all the characters in the film do not exist in the book, especially the women - in Wyndham's story there are no women as important characters. This is just an ordinary not very scary horror film, with old school shooting. May be if you haven't read the book, you will like it. For me it was a disappointment.",Village of the Damned
106,chasandjamie,Love,10,31 January 2019,My all time favorite movie. I watch this movie every chance I get. With they were make another updated version of it💜💜💜,Village of the Damned
107,sharjohnvaz,"Carpenter fans, but...",6,10 February 2007,"We are John Carpenter fans--the 5 of us--(and horror fans in general),but our consensus is that the original ""Village of the Damned"" film of 1960 is still the best version. We can't really all agree on 1 or 2 specific things that set the original apart from this remake. We do agree (among us) that the little children in the 1960 version just somehow seem more menacing, and the adults are appropriately helpless when the children's alien powers are used. Our teenagers are quite amused by the hive-like behavior of the children in both the 1960 and 1995 flicks. It's odd to see Ms. Alley brooding and walking heavily as she chain smokes her way through scenes--lose the cigarettes, the brooding is okay. Don't get the wrong idea, we do enjoy this film, especially Christopher Reeve (alive & well).We are ordinarily very selective about the sequels we watch and enjoy. We tend to watch ""Village of the Damned""(1960) and directly after, view ""Children of the Damned"", simply because we like the films.",Village of the Damned
108,heather_orourke_fan-1,Great Movie,10,7 December 2004,"John Carpenter 1995 remake of the classic Village of the Damned is also a classic. whatever what people may have say, this movie is awesome. the late great Christopher Reeve acting are amazing. its just sad to know that its is last movie before his horrible horse accident. but Reeve is not the best actor in the movie. i would give that title to Lindsey Haun. Lindsey acting as Mara, the leading child is simply amazing. this version is, in my opinion, way better than the original 1960 movie. a lot of people wont agree here thought...i totally recommend that movie, since its my 3rd all time favorite (first being 1982 Poltergeist and second, 1986 Aliens). i give Village of the Damned, a 10/10",Village of the Damned
