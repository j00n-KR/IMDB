0,MartinHafer,Fantastic...but not perfect.,9,30 November 2018,"""Searching"" is one of the best films I've seen in a long time...and I'd place it among the best movies of 2018. This being said, it's got a minor problem that kept it from earning a 10...it left some deliberate Easter eggs which betray a few of the movie's twists. I noticed one...my daughter noticed another. But although we DID anticipate some of the film, overall it still delivered many unexpected suprises AND is incredibly entertaining and unique.John Cho is the star of the story. In a heartbreaking montage, you see him and his wife experiencing great moments in their young lives...including welcoming a daughter. However, she develops cancer and dies...leaving the husband to raise their daughter alone. Now, the film jumps ahead...the daughter is now a teen and seems very normal and talented. But all is NOT well....as, out of the blue, the daughter vanishes...leaving the father frantic. The story is about his search for her which includes his searching her computer trail. I could say more...but don't want to ruin the twists.The amazing thing about this story is that all of it is told as if you are seeing everything on the internet--such as Facebook and other social media posts as well as videos. This is super-clever and original...and the twists and turns only make it more clever and engaging. But, as I mentioned above, the filmmakers occasionally include Easter eggs...which, if solved, might help the viewer anticipate a few of the twists. Still, you WON'T anticipate them all and the film is brilliant and incredibly well made.",Searching
1,Leofwine_draca,A novel thriller,6,31 July 2020,"SEARCHING is an Internet-based thriller with a novel premise: the whle story is told via a computer screen and all of the myriad programs, apps, emails, social media accounts and videos that goes with it. It's not quite original, having already been used for the horror film UNFRIENDED and its sequel UNFRIENDED: DARK WEB, but unlike those two films, this one is actually pretty good. John Cho is fine as the distraught father, putting his Harold & Kumar days long behind him, and the film has a really good pace to keep you watching constantly. There's plenty to say about familial relationships, grief and the facelessness of a modern, Internet-based society, and if it does get increasingly convoluted and mildly ridiculous come the final twist at the climax, it's still a good 'un.",Searching
2,SnoopyStyle,cat goes fishing,6,19 October 2018,"It's the computer screen of David Kim (John Cho) over the years. It documents his life with his loving wife and adorable daughter Margot. They are devastated by the death of his wife. Margot is 16 and there is growing distance between them. When she goes missing, police detective Vick (Debra Messing) investigates.The computer screen gimmick works for the most part in this movie. The introduction of David's life is touching and his harrowing search for his daughter is very consuming. The movie loses me for awhile when there is an obvious deception which is glossed over. The issue nagged at me and nagged at me even while the investigation goes on. The investigation becomes meaningless until the issue gets re-examined. By that time, the movie rushes to finish and it can't do it with an action sequence like a normal thriller. This is the best example of the computer screen movie but it is still constrained by the concept.",Searching

And it takes advantage of the tech aspect of it all. Now there might be scenes in there that would have profited of ""traditional"" filmmaking, but as it is, it really works out for everyone and everything.Having said that, there are also some minor holes. But interestingly enough, I didn't have time to think about them while watching the movie. So if you are not too cynical and do care about what is happening, you may not notice too. If you did, it may spoil the fun a little bit. So try to just take in what is happening, don't overthink it and let the emotional ride take its toll (no pun intended)",Searching
6,Sleepin_Dragon,"An excellent film, despite the distracting direction.",8,1 September 2018,"I am so glad to see so many positive reviews for this film, and I can see why, as it is an excellent film. How nice is it to see a Chinese/American cast lead a film, very welcome indeed. The story is excellent, I really liked how it unfolded, it's a thriller set very much in modern times, the prime obstacles being social media, and the people who live their lives through it. The action was excellent, and as a lover of twists in movies, I was well served here, plenty, lots of things I didn't see coming, really enjoyed.Personally I didn't like the direction of the film, just as the same format spoiled The Shallows, I didn't like the way the story was told, too much advertising for the media giants, and it distracted from the film. The start was very slow, and the ending stretched the imagination beyond belief.A few minor quibbles, but they didn't detract from what is an excellent movie, the best thriller I've watched in a cinema for many years, I also felt it gave an important message about Social media, and the dangers and restraints it places on people.Nice to see the thriller genre can still surprise. 8/10",Searching
7,jboothmillard,Searching,7,20 September 2018,"I saw the trailer for this film a couple of times, I was first interested because of the star of American Pie and the Star Trek reboot movies being the lead star, and the concept looked interesting, all shot from the point-of-view of smartphones and computer screens. Basically in San Jose, California, David Kim (John Cho) and his daughter Margot (Michelle La) have become somewhat distant, following the death of his wife and her mother Pamela Nam Kim (Sara Sohn) from cancer. One night, Margot leaves to go to a study group, while David is sleeping during the night, she calls him three times. He discovers the missed calls the next day, he tries calling her back, but she does not answer, he assumes she is attending a piano lesson. But when he calls the piano instructor, David learns that Margot cancelled her lesson six months ago, he discovers that all her lesson money went into an account, and she transferred $2,500 into a now deleted Venmo account. David decides to report Margot missing, the case is assigned to San Jose Police Department Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) who asks him to give her more information about his daughter. David contacts all of Margot's friends after successfully logging into her Facebook account, and finds that she has no close friends. Vick finds that Margot created a fake ID for herself, she suggests to David that she stole the money and has run away. David discovers that Margot had a YouCast (video blogging) account, and she frequently communicated to a user called fish_n_chips, and through her various social media accounts, David finds that she frequently visited Barbosa Lake. A search crew is sent to Barbosa Lake, there they discover Margot's car underwater and the $2,500 inside. Looking through the crime scene photos, David recognises a jacket belonging to his brother Peter (Joseph Lee) inside Margot's car, he also finds they were interacting often, suggesting a sexual relationship between them. David visits Peter to confront him, taking surveillance cameras with him, the two get into a fight, but Peter tells him that they were communicating to smoke marijuana together, and accuses David of being an incompetent father. Immediately after, Vick calls David to tell him that former convict Randy Cartoff (Ric Sarabia) has made an online confession video, admitting he sexually assaulted and killed Margot, he committed suicide immediately after. While preparing Margot's memorial on a website, David coincidentally discovers an advertisement picture, an image of a young woman matches the profile picture of fish_n_chips, this is a stock photo, he contacts the model of the photo, she does not know about Margot or the case. When trying to call Vick, David accidentally learns that she was not assigned to the case, she volunteered. Suspicious, David finds an article that features Vick volunteering in rebuilding houses with several ex-cons, in the image she is standing next to Cartoff. Believing that Vick is involved with Margot's disappearance, David contacts the Sheriff's police department, she surrenders to the police after they arrive with David. While being interrogated, Vick reveals that her son Robert created the fish_n_chips profile to catfish Margot, he gained knowledge of her from stalking her, and he led Margot into believing his family was in need of money. After Margot paid him the $2,500, he began to feel guilty and wanted to pay her back, Robert followed her to Barbosa Lake one night, he got into her car without warning, she attacked him in confusion, and Robert accidentally Margot into the ravine. Robert desperately called his mother for help, to protect him, Vick shoved Margot's car into the lake, manipulated evidence and the crime scene, and forced Cartoff to falsely admit to killing Margot before murdering him. David and the police rush to the ravine, where Margot is found alive. Sometime later, photos show that Margot has applied for college to major in piano, her status is pending, she and her father David have reconciled and have many phone and video conversations together. Also starring Alex Jayne Go as Young Margot (5 years), Megan Liu as Young Margot (7 years) and Kya Dawn Lau as Young Margot (9 years). Cho gives a pretty good performance as the concerned father determined to find out the truth behind his daughter going missing, Messing is also interesting as the detective updating him, the action mostly takes place through various recognisable social media platforms, it really makes you realise both the good and bad sides of using this technology, it may sound like something that could have been boring, but the unconventional plot and inventive structure is far from it, it keeps you guessing all the way, a stylish and watchable thriller.

8,BandSAboutMovies,Way better than a gimmick movie!,7,7 February 2019,"Aneesh Chaganty created a movie called Seeds with Google Glass that hit a million views in under one day. Following its success, he was part of the Google Creative Lab, where he spent two years developing, writing and directing Google commercials. This film was originally intended as a short, but got the funding to be a full movie. That meany that Aneesh had to make the leap from a dream job to another dream job, but one that had no guarantees. Luckily, Searching is a great first effort. And it doesn't hurt that it grossed $75 million dollars on a $1 million dollar budget.The entire film is viewed via different screens, starting with David Kim (John Cho) looking back on the last two years. The pre-movie sequence effortlessly uses the tools we experience every day to tell the story of how his wife died and he became distant from his daughter, Margot.Over the next few days, he'll learn just how little he knows about her as she goes missing. He'll have plenty of help from the public and Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). But even time he thinks he's close to finding her, she slips further and further away. In fact, she may be gone for good.Unlike traditional narratives that only show one side of the story, the film uses YouTube comments, hashtags and social posts to show every facet of its characters, even the tiniest of background roles. I loved how much information got packed into every frame.As someone who works in marketing, I also adored how stock photography ended up playing such a major role in the mystery. I really don't want to say any more than that - this is a ride that you should take without knowing all that much.The crazy thing is that Aneesh filmed the entire movie playing every single role, with the real actors being fit in after the film had a rough edit. I'd love to see more of this, which is only hinted on the disk's extras. In fact, if you're someone that bemoans the loss of extras on recent films, this movie is packed with features that explain how the film was created and its many easter eggs.Speaking of that, this movie is bursting at the seams with hidden messages. In a shout out to the first movie made in this style, Unfriended, one of that film's characters named Laura Barns appears as a trending topic throughout the movie. There are multiple news articles about one of M. Night Shyamalan's biggest fans getting to meet the director (this would be Aneesh, angling to meet his real-life hero). And throughout the film, there are multiple stories about an alien invasion, whether they run as trending topics or on crawls during news shows. I love the idea that life keeps going despite this world-changing event.Perhaps most amazingly, when this movie was edited for foreign countries, every screen was recreated in its respective language, as well as every typing sequence, keystroke by keystroke.I know that this movie is based on a gimmick, but I was shocked how much I ended up enjoying it. Check it out - perhaps you'll feel the same way.",Searching
9,oscaralbert,Best described as THE CRYING GAME for the Computer Age . . .,10,7 September 2018,". . . this reverse SIXTH SENSE film is the first flick--from a field of literally hundreds--to integrate the computers, social media, screen shots, found footage, and search engines of Our Digital Age into a Classic Cinematic Triumph of which Humanity can be proud a century from now. Starting with its poignantly somber opening right through to its cleverly concealed climactic epiphany, SEARCHING constitutes a intricately constructed masterpiece that easily transcends half of Hitchcock's films. (Those viewers who would quibble over SEARCHING's ""red herring"" false leads and plot points straining credulity should take another look at Hitch's VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, NORTH BY NORTHWEST, and either version of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH.) Competing for casting acclaim with the concurrent flick CRAZY RICH ASIANS, the SEARCHING filmmakers rely at least as much on their lead characters' ethnicity to teach lessons about our Modern 21st Century World which transcend the movies. KIN may THINK that it's about Family, but SEARCHING is 110% more so.",Searching
10,neil-476,Excellent,9,9 September 2018,"David and daughter Margot are devastated when mother Pam is taken by cancer. Perhaps they are getting past it when Margot disappears. As David helps police detective Vick by trawling through Margot's computer looking for clues, he gradually realises that he didn't know Margot as well as he had thought, and that her disappearance might be deliberate.The title of this film is clever. It refers to David's search, and also indicates waiting for the computer to return a result - this film is all on screen. Mostly this is computer screens (social media, messenger apps and the like), but also TV news reports. Of the recent films presented as screen views, this is by far the best. It tells a strong story, with a number of twists. And it tells it well with great emotional depth. In particular, the opening - home movies showing Margot's birth and her growing up, as far as Pam's death - is as emotional as the prologue in Up.John Cho is David and Debra Messing is Vick - both are excellent. Newcomer Michelle La does well as Margot, a tricky part given Margot's tendency to keep herself under wraps.I thoroughly enjoyed and was gripped by this. Unusual, and very well done.",Searching

So we watch this story play out through text messages, video chat, surveillance footage, news reports, etc. It's a gimmick I've seen a million times that can be either novel or a drag, depending on how it's used. Here it's used well, and I never had that feeling I so often do in movies of this type that it became implausible to continue the gimmick. John Cho plays his role well, especially when you consider that he often was acting alone. I'm not sure Debra Messing was ever entirely believable, but oh well. The movie has a major twist and a lengthy segment in which one of the characters explains the whole film to the audience and nearly had me laughing out loud at the obvious plot exposition, but that's just the kind of movie this is and you'll have more fun with it if you suck it up and go with the flow.Grade: A-",Searching

For that alone it's already special as you never have the feeling there are shots were people meet eachother in real life. I was a bit skeptic in the beginning but the truth is that the more the story advances the more you get into it. It's not all perfect as to me they could have mixed a bit of real life filming with it but even without that it surprisingly worked. There are enough twists and turns to keep you interested and if I have to be honest I didn't see the end coming, and that's always positive when you watch a mystery movie. The acting wasn't bad at all concidering that most of the actors are more series than movie actors. The hidden moral of this story is that you should watch out what you put on the social media sites.

16,Red-Barracuda,Highly original and compelling thriller,8,24 June 2018,"This is a thriller which can certainly be accurately described as original. It takes a fairly typical suspense story about a recently widowed father whose daughter vanishes one night and presents it in a most unique way. The whole film plays out on the computer screen via programs such as Facetime, iMessage, Gmail, Tumblr, Facebook, etc. In this way, it reflects the reality that so many people now live, given that so many nowadays are literally never off their devices. In this way, the film is completely relevant and taps into a scenario most will be able to clearly identify with. The conceit is also terrific in that it accentuates the mystery element of the story, where we stumble upon clues via the various social media platforms. The very limitations of the set-up ultimately amplify the material and take it to another level. I found it to be one of the most original, gripping and compelling thrillers I have seen in quite a while. Lead actor John Cho must be credited too with giving a strong central performance as the grieving father, with some good additional work from Debra Messing as the detective assigned to the case.

The one aspect, no spoilers since it happens almost immediately, was what triggered me and with that foundation, the rest was at a critical drama level until the finale.Basically, we having a loving family of three: Mother, Father and Daughter and when the mother succumbs to cancer, Father is sad, but carries on with taking care of his high school daughter. One day, she vanishes and we watch the entire episode of his loss and grief from the point of view of computers and the internet. The movie is about her disappearance and his attempts to find her, hopefully still alive.While I love the concept of the movie - it takes place exclusively online or within a computer, this movie's emotional rollercoaster is at an eleven and for that, you have to thank John Cho's best performance in this career. Everyone else helped and was believable, but I rode his emotional coaster this entire time and was never off track.Wow, even with the restrains of only filming computer screens - which were comforting from year's past screens I am so familiar with - the movie was one of the most well-paced, unique and interesting mysteries I've seen in a long while. Also, the third-act...NEVER saw it coming. So, well done!Highly recommended, though if you've lost a loved one, specifically spouse, Mother or child, this one might be tough for you, as well.***Final thoughts: Admittedly, since I recently lost my own mother, I didn't spend 2-3 minutes of this film NOT in tears. The mother's death did set me off, but since now the Dad was left with his own immediate family member, his daughter, I was 100% with him this entire sad journey. Not sure this would be the same reaction from anyone seeing this, but personally, I was choked up this entire film.Also, admittedly, I did JUST watch this for my crush on John Cho.

20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"You can search all you like, you won't find a better 'found footage' film.",8,4 September 2018,"'Searching (2018)' is a tense and exciting edge-of-your-seat thriller that's also surprisingly realistic, thanks mainly to its phenomenally fresh presentation - an all-encompassing, detail-oriented and all-around supremely executed 'screen-capture' style that never breaks, not even for a second, and is so much more than the gimmick it might at first seem. Indeed, this concept infinitely enhances the film to the point that it wouldn't even be worth making without it (a more conventional movie in which John Cho sits in front of his computer for most of the run-time wouldn't be anywhere near as involving as this). It's so well achieved that you often forget about it despite being constantly in awe of how simply brilliant it is. It just makes sense and always feels like an extension of the narrative, rather than a marketing trick. The plot is never forced into its constraints, instead expanding out from and being communicated expertly through them. There's an incredible attention to detail, from the little things such as a 'control-paste' key-command to the larger things such as a video-chat being left open being the reason why the lead character's face is visible. The feature is able to convey so much character even when nobody is physically on screen, though, fantastically putting us in the headspace of the person using the PC. Its style also provides clever solutions to possible narrative problems, such as flashbacks and exposition, and it even comments on our current social-media craze in an elegant and accurate way. Perhaps my only gripe with the piece is its slightly overbearing and non-diegetic score, which is most notable in the opening sequence. Once the movie is underway, it isn't all that noticeable but still feels slightly out of place. However, even when the story succumbs to slightly more conventional beats and an ending exposition sequence that's overt if excusable, the picture is constantly invigoratingly original, amazingly compelling and bracingly exciting. It's also surprisingly moving. Not only is it easily the best 'found footage' film I've ever seen, it's up there with the best thrillers of recent memory, too. 8/10",Searching

A widower (John Cho) finds that his teenage daughter (Michelle La) has disappeared, and begins frantically going through her social media and online presence in the attempt to find clues about what may have happened to her. Helping him is a detective (Debra Messing), and the more he discovers, the more he finds that he doesn't really know his daughter at all, which is further unsettling. The film thus has several gut-wrenching components of loss - losing the wife/mother (Sara Sohn) to cancer, having a child disappear, and gradually discovering the image you have of a loved one is woefully incomplete - for isn't disillusionment another form of loss? Creative in its story-telling, which is entirely from the perspective of interfacing to various devices and applications in the modern age, the film also serves as a highly realistic 'documentary' for the way we connect to the world for so much of our lives. It's hard to believe now, but in a few decades the technology shown will likely be viewed as quaint, and in time may fascinate watchers of 'old' movies as much as little elements in films from the 1930's tickle us. I was worried this might be too gimmicky or impede the film in some way, but it doesn't at all. At the same time, while the computer interfaces feel highly realistic, there were elements in the story that weren't, for example, its timeline, and some of the actions of the characters, but I don't want to spoil it.There is real tension as the film plays out, because of the emotional stakes involved, and because we really don't know what's going to happen. There are just enough possible suspects and aspects of the evidence that we get led down a few different paths in our mind, perhaps similar to the roller coaster ride the father is on. I'm not sure if John Cho's performance has enough angst and grief in it, but he's reasonably strong, as is the rest of the cast, and in a very interesting way, the film explores the depths of parental devotion.

Count me in, this was on paper destined to be something special.Sadly whenever I hype a movie up like this they tend to fall flat, but not Searching. No, no Searching lived up to my high expectations and the John Cho movie demonstrated that this is one of those guys like Ryan Reynolds and Will Smith who truly can do it all.The whole movie plays out through pc windows and camera footage. Yes it has been done before with the likes of Unfriended (2014) but they took the concept to the next level here and it works considerably better than you'd imagine.John Cho delivers an emotional tour de force with some of the best written material I've seen in years. It's so clever, so intricate and just when you think you've got it all figured out another spanner is thrown into the works to make you re-evaluate everything you've seen so far.As I'm getting older I'm becoming a harsher critic because I've seen everything before.

30,paulclaassen,Really awesome!,7,14 January 2019,"Being another cheaply made film with no real camera work, action, interesting sets, etc, I was very hesitant in watching this, and quite honestly expected a boring yawn of a time. Instead, this was thrilling and rather suspenseful. John Cho is excellent as the father who soon realizes he never really knew his daughter at all, and that there were more going on than meets the eye. It is fascinating the way the story unfolds, and we learnt more about the case as the father did - almost as if in real time. The film pays great attention to detail with everything being very authentic, and very credible.I didn't find Debra Messing particularly believable as the Detective. Yes, maybe because she is too well known as Grace from Will & Grace and I kept expecting her to suddenly do or say something stupid or out of place. She just doesn't cut it as a serious actress. Someone like 'Julianne Moore' would have been awesome in this role. Nevertheless, this was a very entertaining film and a huge surprise!",Searching
31,zkonedog,An Engaging Mystery In A Unique Format,8,1 September 2018,"A couple of years ago, an episode of the TV show ""Modern Family"" introduced the unique concept of doing an entire episode pictured either on mobile devices or social media. ""Searching"" takes that concept and runs with it, producing a film that tells an engaging mystery through the lens of social media and the internet.For a basic plot summary, ""Searching"" sees father David Kim (John Cho) start worrying when daughter Margot (Michelle La) doesn't come home after a supposed study-group night with friends. This scenario quickly escalates to a missing persons situation, and Detective Vick (Debra Messing) comes onto the scene to lead the investigation. As the search for Margot intensifies, David digs into her social media and other online accounts and finds that the daughter he thought he knew wasn't necessarily the Margot presented to the rest of the world.Because this is a film based around a mystery premise, I can't say too much about the plot for fear of spoilers. What I can definitively disclose, however, is that by no means is this a ""gimmick"" film. It would have been easy for that to transpire, as the visual concept (all technology) is so entrancing. Fortunately, director Aneesh Chaganty makes sure that the plot or characters are never overshadowed or pushed aside by the tech focus. Stripped away of all the phones, computers, and the like and done in a more traditional method, ""Searching"" still would be a solid, suspenseful mystery.Another thing I appreciated about this movie is that it doesn't moralize about technology or social media at all. I'm not saying that such an approach would be bad, necessarily, but I do feel like it has been done to death in recent years. Here, the technology is used for both good and sinister purposes, and never once explicitly commented on. It just ""exists"". This approach felt refreshing to me, as it presented the material as ""what is"" instead of ""what should be"", and in this case I think the film was better for it.Overall, I very much enjoyed ""Searching"" for its ability to tell an engaging mystery tale full of interesting characters, and do it in a completely unique fashion. This can appeal to a wide audience, and is something you can pretty much take the whole family too (right down to the pre-teens) and everyone can find something to relate to or think about.",Searching

The writing is well done and polished.John Cho delivers a very genuine performance as the lead father in search of his lost teenage daughter. There are some clever and intriguing aspects about the film and there seems to always be something to ponder about.Ultimately the ending gives several twists and may feel quite predictable, none the less it was still quite an enjoyable watch seeing everything unfold.

33,eddie_baggins,A well-put together thriller let down by a terrible last act,7,17 December 2018,"Working with what may at first appear to be a rather gimmicky concept and delivery, Searching ends up being a surprisingly effective thriller made by utilising common household/personal items such as laptops and mobile phones to create an immersive and often well-thought out missing person's narrative.Directed by first time director Aneesh Chaganty with support from Wanted filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov, who producers here, Searching follows John Cho's dedicated single parent David Kim whose trying to uncover the reasoning behind his 16 year old daughter Margot's sudden disappearance, with nothing more than some unhelpful detectives and a previously hidden online world that Margot lived in to help him in his cause.For a first time filmmaker, Chaganty does a fantastic job combining all these elements into one cohesive whole and while for a time at the start of the film the delivery is a little off-putting, you quickly forget you are watching a film largely taking place over online searches, social media stalking and face time conversations, with Searching perfectly encapsulating our modern day reliance on these technologies to function to in turn explore its narrative arc.Front and centre to all of this is Cho whose given the best role of his career yet as the likeable David.Still best known for slacker stoner comedy Harold and Kumar, Cho is constantly engaging as David who will stop at nothing to uncover the mystery of his daughter's disappearance. It mustn't be an easy task delivering an acting turn in such a non-conforming way but Cho is up for it and displays all the emotions you would expect from such a story despite its unique delivery.With such strong beginning (featuring a nostalgic technology overload) and middle-acts, it's unfortunate for Searching that things take a rather detrimental turn for the worse when a late act twist leads to an increasingly unbelievable and misguided finale.So much of Chaganty's work leading up to the films eye rolling end game feels so well put together that it's hard to complain too much but it does feel like Searching was the type of film that had the idea and smarts but just not the foresight to wrap it all up in the final stages, making Searching a constantly engaging and enjoyable exercise but one that finishes in a largely forgettable way.Final Say -A seen a million times before thriller that feels fresh and new thanks to its smartly designed construction, Searching is a lot better than many would've expected it to be, let down only by its mediocre last act.3 ½ Bieber concerts out of 5",Searching
34,TheMovieDiorama,Searching manages to turn social networking into an emotionally charged twisty thriller.,7,12 September 2018,"We've seen this style of filmmaking before with 'Unfriended' and, whilst it did work, felt too gimmicky to be taken seriously. Chaganty's directorial debut utilises the same aesthetic appeal and adds a substantial amount of realism to enhance both the emotional investment of its characters and the plot itself. Not to mention the trip down nostalgia lane, I haven't seen Windows XP in years! A father attempts to find his missing daughter by investigating her social networking profiles, with the help of a police detective. The beauty of this thriller is how simplistic it is. No gargantuan set pieces or over-elaborate plots filled with convolution. This is simply a parent's worst nightmare that unfolds through the point-of-view of smartphones and monitors. The realistic yet relatable story immediately absorbs you in. Chaganty ingeniously commences character development from the first screen as we witness this loving family blossoming together. Then, as tragedy strikes, the emotional complexity of the situation beckons you to feel the character's emotions as the theme of parenting remains prevalent throughout. This wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for Cho's nuanced central performance, practically holding the whole film together. As with all thrillers, there are twists and turns to keep you engaged. Whilst I did piece together the mystery before it revealed itself, it was executed with such astute precision and methodical planning that you start to believe you are the one investigating the case. All the clues are present, and Chaganty's subliminal direct address makes the whole experience more enjoyable. After a certain revelation is discovered, the concluding ten minutes unfortunately destroy an intelligent thriller. The constant explanations of foreshadowing detracted from the intellectual narrative and rapidly succumbed to over-explaining. The suspense had dissipated, tension was relieved and motives were overwrought. Borrowdale's score also felt reminiscent of 'The Sims', just too optimistic. Still, an innovative thriller.",Searching

36,matthewssilverhammer,Solid Mystery Thriller with a Unique and Pointed Gimmick,8,8 September 2018,"Our modern, tech-heavy, screen-focused world is a dichotomy. The insidious and powerful danger of an internet-dependent world is that it manages to make us both more connected and less connected simultaneously. It provides us with unending knowledge and leisure, but also isolates and exacerbates loneliness. Searching uses its unique storytelling gimmick (everything taking place within the characters' screens) to get this across, all while giving us a solid crime-mystery-thriller that replaces the genre-staples of quick edits and shaky cameras with dramatic clicks-and-drags.
The film opens with a powerfully moving, Up-esque montage (where we get to see massive jumps in technology over the past 10 years), before settling into its proper story. Cho plays a widowing father whose daughter suddenly goes missing, and he has only her digital and social media presence to help him find her. With the slowly revealed clues and skin-crawling details, it will certainly tickle the fancy of currently ubiquitous murder-porn addicts. However, director Chaganty's control over tone (especially the moments of welcome comic relief) and Cho's soulful lead turn make this scene-turner shine above lesser, seedier whodunnits.
Sure, there are some less-than-realistic moments that hurt the flow. For one thing, I don't know anyone who uses computers as thoroughly as these people (does anyone actually use the address book on their computer desktop? If so, I doubt they fill in the notes section with details on how they know the person). It also isn't completely immune from the melodrama that can often accompany mystery-tragedies like this. Mostly though, Searching is a heart-pounding, devastating, and undeniably compelling experiment.",Searching
37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Searching"" offers new thrills with solid storytelling behind it",8,7 December 2018,"Gimmicky concept films such as ""Searching"" -- a mystery that takes place ""entirely on a screen"" -- bravely put themselves out there. They aim to be the first to uncharted cinematic territory while opening themselves up for scrutiny. Aneesh Chaganty's feature film debut dares to be a pioneer in the category of films that reflect our digitized lives, and while it will take a lot of deserved fire, it does a few things exceptionally well.""Searching"" stars John Cho as the father of a high school senior gone missing (Michelle La), who sifts through all manner of virtual clues to piece together what may have happened to her. Yet that's not where the film begins, which is the first clutch call of the script written by Chaganty and Sev Ohanian. They give the Kim family a tragic back story and chronicle that digitally at the beginning of the film, adding a layer of depth that is both non-essential to the plot yet essential in so many other ways. Think of it like the digital age version of the tear-inducing montage in Pixar's ""Up.""A missing person thriller doesn't need that element, but it adds so much emotional depth to the story (and provides some misdirection in mystery, but that's secondary), helping pull some focus away from the screen gimmick. Like a better version of an Apple or Facebook commercial, Chaganty serves us a reminder of the way our devices have captured and chronicled our lives and lets that simmer in our brains as we watch the rest of this entertainment-focused film unfold.There are holes to poke in this mystery like so many mystery-driven films before it, yet Chaganty and Ohanian have found a crisp, clean means of hooking their audience. Watching the film feels akin to that high you get when you are hunting for answers through Google and find them, or dare I say stalking someone on social media and discovering the key details about them.The story follows David running his own digital investigation alongside the detective on his case (Debra Messing), setting David up as the audience's mirror in a way a character hasn't ever really done before. In a way, ""Searching"" is the closest the genre has come to merging pure fiction with a choose-your-own adventure mystery. We experience the illusion of being in control of the story because David's ideas of where to look next or what guesses to make so closely resemble the choices we'd make on our own under the same circumstances. Even watching David figure out how to get into Margot's various accounts, working his way backward, is a familiar experience to so many yet not one we've ever seen reflecting in a movie before. That's a unique thrill and Chaganty nails it.Between offering such a fresh viewing experience and its unexpected emotional angle, ""Searching"" overcomes the ploys put in place to keep the whole story happening on a screen and any issues one might have with the core mystery. They are obvious but forgivable in service of some really thoughtful, smart writing and craftmanship that ventures into new forms of storytelling.~Steven CThanks for reading!

39,paul-allaer,Will have you at the edge of your seat from start to finish,8,11 September 2018,"""Searching"" (2018 release; 102 min.) brings the story of David Kim and his 16 yr. old daughter Margot. As the movie opens, a clever video montage shows Margot growing up over the years, while David's wife Pam struggling with heath issues, and passing away in 2015. We then jump to the present, as David and Margot are on FaceTime one evening, and Margot telling him she's going to spend the entire evening with a study group at a friend's house. Soon thereafter things take a surprising twist... At this point we're less than 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is a missing person mystery-thriller the likes of which I have never seen before. The entire movie is filmed from the perspective of a smart phone, a computer, television footage, or security camera. But more importantly, after the opening montage of Margot growing up over the year, we are quasi-immediately thrown into the action, with David on the defensive to try and piece together what has happened. Credit surely must go to director (and co-writer) Aneesh Chaganty, who makes his feature length debut, and what a debut it turns out to be! The visual and audio composition of the film is striking as well (I really like the original score by Torin Borrowdale, another name that I previously was not familiar with. The only recognizable presence for me is John Cho (best known as Sulu in the Star Trek franchise reboot), playing the role of David Kim. But ultimately the biggest surprise for me is how tense the movie stays throughout. I'm trying to recall another movie where that is the case, and while I'm sure there are others out there, I can't think of any off the top of my head. Given the unexpected box office success this movie is becoming, surely a sequel will be forthcoming. Bring it on!""Searching"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to immediate positive buzz. After a limited release in August, the movie expanded wide, with ever great acclaim.

40,jtindahouse,A masterpiece that defies its limitations,10,16 September 2018,"Just by complete coincidence the last movie I saw before 'Searching' was 'Unfriended: Dark Web', another movie set entirely on a computer screen. That one was a horror movie, while 'Searching' is more of a mystery/thriller. Is this becoming the new ""found-footage"" concept to take the movie-making world by storm? Probably not, because there is just so much limitation on what can actually be done with the concept. Which brings me to the first thing I liked so much about this movie. Early on in the film I thought to myself, this concept is all well and good for now - but it is seriously going to hamper it later in the film when things heat up, right? Wrong. The movie does an incredible job of never being (or at least feeling) limited by the way it is presented. This is quite an incredible film in a lot of ways.The next thing that caught me off-guard with this film was just how intricate and clever the story was. Again, early on I found myself thinking that they had kept the film very simple in concept so as to allow them to work around it easily for the computer screen concept. And again how wrong I was. This movie is a roller-coaster ride of both emotions and plot-twists. And they weren't just there for the sake of it, or to pad the runtime. They had genuine validity and had always been set up expertly earlier in the film.And that's the third thing that blew me away. The amount of retrospective thinking this film allows after the credits roll is incredible. All the clues were there, all the hints were right before our eyes, none of the red-herrings cheated in any way. This film is a masterpiece that demands multiple viewings. I really hope people aren't put off by the concept, or associate it with 'Unfriended' and don't see it because they don't like horror. This is a brilliant film that demands to be seen. If you haven't already, rush out and see it. You'll be very happy you did.",Searching
41,hellraiser7,Cyper Detective,10,19 October 2019,"We are always trying to find and create connections in more ways then one, one of the things most suspense thriller have in common are in the connects the characters make under the circumstances, this always happens because the protagonists are most of the time people that are alone. It's not just these life and death circumstances that drive them to connect but also show the overall importance of it, because sometimes we need the other to help us win or even save our life.This is a suspense thriller like certain web sites got lost under the radar but is one of my favorite suspense thriller of all time.It's truly a unique kind of suspense thriller as it's all done from the use of the web. I love how the film has a participatory sense as the dad is detective 1 and you the viewer or viewers are detectives 2 and 3. As David is constantly clicking and observing, we are observing with him trying to piece it all together with him. The way it's handled it almost feels like a Point and Click Adventure game for the PC, as most of those games were about observation and investigation. I really love the use of each of the social media apps as each of them turn out to be essential puzzle pieces thorough the film.The suspense is great as it is just tense from beginning to end as you are constantly on edge and at the same time visuals and thoughtfully invested. From the very beginning I really like how the suspense gradually starts up, when you see a certain signal on the computer pop up, I just felt a great disturbance in the force, that little detail you already know Margot is in terrible danger, this really hits home because things like that do happen. But at that point the search is on, from the amount of point and click investigating and the video feed you see you don't dare take your eyes off the screen otherwise you might miss a crucial detail.The mystery is very well put together as there are some twists and turns and even a few red herrings in places that could almost throw you off track. Like for example most of the evidence we see seems to lead to the possibility of a typical runaway case but just like the dad I'm not one hundred percent invested in that possibility because certain things about it don't add up.But what also powers this film is the main protagonist himself, played well by underrated actor John Cho. You really feel a strong sense of pathos for him as we see him determined as hell conducting his own search for his daughter. But also some depth from the very beginning of the film which is sort of similar in a way to the film ""Up"" though that's a different story. As we see he's been having to deal with loss of his wife and how he's been going though the motions of being a single parent. Though you also feel equal pathos for the daughter Margot (Michelle La) we don't fully know at first but from most things we uncover we can see she hasn't been a happy camper after the loss.I like how the residing theme in this film is about reconnection. The dad really does want to reconnect with his daughter, you could say this whole mystery was one hell of a way to do it. However, we see from our finding that even the daughter herself wants it too not just with her dad again but life itself. From this amount of depth it made you care all the more, made you want to win, every minute in the investigation truly counts and wining and losing does matter.For any fan of the suspense thriller genre, this film is worth searching for.Rating: 4 stars",Searching

As written and acted the various character are multifaceted and layered more so than they usually are in this sort of fare. Cho, especially, gives a striking performance as the father doing everything he can to find his daughter. I think if told conventionally this would be a gripping thriller.Fortunately, the story is told in a ground breaking manner. It's cross between a found footage film and captured social media. The entire film is presented through social media, captured desktop footage, hidden camera etc. It all adds up to a style that is unique; and the language of the film is easily learned and not annoying. Best of all, without being overbearing, the film talks about how much technology influences our interpersonal relationships and plays around with what it means to know someone. The twist only re-enforces this thematic point. On the surface it's a whodunit but look deeper and the film is about whoisit.

When Margot fails to respond to his phone calls and messages, David becomes concerned and files a missing persons report. However, when the police struggle to find any leads David turns detective himself and with a mixture of belief and hope he decides to use his daughter's laptop in the hope that it may provide some explanation for her disappearance...Director Aneesh Chagantry has certainly done his homework here and seems to pretty much use every modern day internet site to frame the story; Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Face Time (so Iphone and Apple)Tumblr, You Cast (is that made up as I've never heard of it?). On the one hand this could be seen as cynical commercialism - I'm sure the founders of a lot of these sites will appreciate the free advertising, but is Chagnatry over-egging the pudding here?. However, it could also be viewed as a terrifying social commentary on the potential dangers of social media. Despite the heavy product placement after watching this film I still see it falling more into the latter camp.This is director and writer Aneesh Chaganty's first project and despite the fact that I felt that he may have over-researched things slightly - I'm not really sure that all of the various websites and social media platforms were really necessary in order to tell a compelling story. That being said, he does direct with a sense of urgency and does get a really strong performance from John Cho (when watching this film I almost forgot that this was the same guy that played goofball characters like the milf guy in American Pie and Harold in the Harold and Kumar films). Cho totally absorbs himself in the character of a frightened parent doing everything he can to find his daughter. Cho's performance is anchored by a good script which sees him behaving and acting in exactly the way any normal parent would react when trying to find their child (at no point did I ever find anything forced or contrived about the way David acted which only enhanced the viewing experience).One thing the film does touch upon is David's own belief that he has failed as a parent and has let his daughter down; he doesn't seem to know the names of any of Margot's friends and also forgets her birthday at one point in the film. Despite this I didn't see him as a bad father (and the way he doggedly tries to find his daughter proves otherwise). I viewed it that his wife was perhaps more involved with his daughter's social circle and birthday's and other occasions and therefore David took a back seat in proceedings (which he clearly regrets and only really sees after his daughter goes missing).Just when you're starting to piece things together the film throws in several twists and turns at the end and I have to admit that I was thoroughly involved in proceedings and didn't take my eyes off the screen once throughout its 100 minute running time.Searching is a very good film that is thrilling, intriguing and in some ways terrifying - I've always said that the internet was a brilliant invention (thank you Tim Berners-Lee) and likewise the likes of Facebook and Twitter are a great way to meet new friends and keep in touch. However, Searching does explore the dark side of technology and highlights how easy it is for an individual to wear a metaphorical mask online and become whoever they want to become (and unfortunately Margot was on the wrong end of such deception).Despite an overuse and somewhat unnecessary use of product-placement Searching is an excellent film which acts as a both a frightening cautionary tale and a terrifying social commentary and, judging on his debut effort, I'll be sure to check out anything else Aneesh Chagantry has in the pipeline in the future.",Searching

Desperate, dad breaks into her laptop to look for clues to find her.

Yes there was impersonation, but there wasn't any freud or anything, the son didn't do anything bad to be honest, it was an accident.

Which brings us to...Searching, which is essentially an engrossing story of a father and his missing daughter. But this Gone Girl scenario is totally told via social media outlets. John Cho plays David Kim, the distraught father suddenly concerned about the whereabouts of his missing child and Debra Messing is Officer Vick, the chief police detective on the case. (Both are very good in their roles)The screenplay by the director, Aneesh Chaganty, and his co-writer, Sev Ohanian, borders on a gimmicky premise by conveying its narrative seen only through today's technology: computer screens, video cameras, television newscasts, cellphones, etc. This concept gives the film an innovative look, but it also locks in the characters into the film's plot structure. The film begins with a moving montage of past videos which quickly establishes the family's dynamics, other scenes strain to use this all-media approach to tell the narrative with logical sense. This conceit ultimately forces limits on the filmmakers to be inventive and set up a clinical approach to addressing a compelling mystery. Fortunately, the filmmakers are up to the task and deliver a highly original modern-day whodunnit. However, even with all their hard work, the film will seem dated in a few years, almost a period piece with the fast advances of most new and future technical devices introduced on the market every year.While the film cleverly follows a father using the Internet as his primary tool to locate his missing daughter, it can be a tad redundant in its imagery of multiple screens, websites, and written text messaging for the entire ninety minutes or so. Sometimes the mechanics of the plot seems so forced into sticking to the computer concept of the film making some scenes contrived and illogical, especially as the film leads to its slightly far-fetched but within-the-realm-of probable conclusion.Still, the director brings much style and complexity to his tale. Mr. Chaganty has created a well structured mystery with enough twists and turns that keep the action moving as the clues are slowly revealed. The moviegoing audience immediately identifies with the parent-child dilemma and the investigation of a possible abduction/ murder case and becomes riveted to the ongoing mystery and its well written characters.Tautly directed and innovative in its vision, Searching is a nifty little thriller, one that may be easily overlooked by the general public.

Your Results Have Matched 1,9,1 September 2018,"It's been advertised like crazy in the theaters and it seems to be limited release, so I can say I was happy when I saw my first film tonight hit my theaters. Tonight's installment promises to be a real suspense/thriller, and bring with it a new story that will have everyone talking. Yet, do the trailers tell an accurate mini tale, or like the Internet this film is based on, does it hide something else that will prove to be lackluster. Robbie K here, and tonight I first review: Movie: Searching (2018)Director:
 Aneesh Chaganty
Writers:
 Aneesh Chaganty, Sev Ohanian
Stars:
 John Cho, Debra Messing, Joseph Lee 
LIKES: Good acting: John Cho is primarily the central character, carrying the weight of the cast on his shoulders and working some major magic. His character was designed well, a realistic portrayal of a father panicking to find his child and balance all the emotions that go with it. As for his co actors, they too play their parts well, each integrating themselves heavily into the role and crafting a believable performance that fits so well in the movie. All characters are essential to the film, and this is a shining example of character utilization. Realistic: Dramas often lose the grip on the reality, going down some wild tangent to bring a unique twist to the movie and go down the super dramatic path. While Searching is certainly a drama, Chaganty did a fantastic job guiding the story and keeping the film feeling like something from real life. It's as if we are actually in a new story and this display of believability and planning is a solid reason for how I remained engaged into the film. No distractive, annoying characters that overshadow here... it's a straight up balanced role. Story layout: The movie is certainly a mystery, but within it is also some serious character development and a suspense that keeps on evolving. I agree with my fellow reviewers that Searching's story layout remains true to its purpose, but manages to slightly rotate the tale to give it a refresh and snag your intention. In addition, the plot is laid out quite well, with strong attention to detail and careful planning that paid off in the long run. Replaying the movie in my head, I was able to understand where all the clues were and applaud the set up Chaganty and the crew had set up. The Twists: I mentioned this above, but the twists deserve their own category in how well they worked in this film. The movie used the surprises in very creative ways, and didn't overdo them to take the film too far down a weird road that makes no sense. Therefore, one should enjoy the surprises in store. The Pace: Dramas can be slow, but Searching's speed is steady, progressive, and entertaining from start to finish. The editing was fantastic to balance inclusion of the necessary details, but not get lost in the trees that make up this complex forest. It managed to develop the characters at just the right moments and build on the foundations, but yet make sure not to derail from the tracks of the story itself. As such, this pace keeps the whole tale intriguing and not a snooze fest. 
DISLIKES:Predictable: This is grasping for straws, but I was able to figure out who the culprit was fairly early in the game. The movie sets up enough clues that seem subtle, but the choice of dropping them at those times gives it away. In addition, the cliché presentation leads to some linear techniques that given the history of the genre point to the right conclusions. Not the most major dislike, but something to consider. The Laptop Presentation: Is it unique? Yes! Does it integrate you into the full experience? Yes! However, I fear that the presentation will be copied and grow stale. It's not so much a dislike in this film as it is a warning to not go nuts and use this style for every film coming out in the new age. 
The VERDICT:  Searching is a movie I didn't expect to like as much, but while it is a tried and true story, it's got a fantastic presentation that freshens it back up. The acting, story development, and pace all align to make a great movie and thanks to these qualities makes the movie feel like a new original. It's attention to detail is fantastic, and the pace is exceptionally balanced like other aspects of this movie. While not perfect or the most groundbreaking piece of work, this glorified crime-drama certainly hits its mark and brings the results you might have been investigating. I'd recommend this one for the theater and strongly encourage to not watch too many trailers to maximize the twists to the T. My scores: 
Drama/Mystery/Thriller: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0",Searching

I would highly recommend seeing it in a theater, that is if it is still in theaters at the time of you reading this review. Plot - This is a movie where all you need is a vague idea of what its about - a father looking for his missing daughter. This movie is full of well-executed twists and turns that shouldn't be spoiled. Characters - Everyone is extremely well written and and well acted. I've never seen a movie that pulled off a montage of the main characters' lives at the beginning of the movie well. The opening montage well establishes the characters and their relationships with no dialogue. I was on the verge of tears by the time the story began it was so good. Every other movie I've seen attempt something like that just fails horribly, and makes the montage end up being a poorly-executed exposition dump. This movie deserves praise for all the well-done character moments - not just at the beginning but all throughout the story. Cinematography - If you didn't already know, this entire movie is done found-footage style where most of it is a computer screen. If you know anything about these types of movies, they are almost guaranteed to be some of the most comically inept movies ever made. Luckily, this movie was made by people who understand how the internet works and is consequently brilliant. Like I said, this movie is great. It does everything extremely well.

62,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Searching,8,6 October 2018,"""I didn't know her. I didn't know my daughter"". Me, well I ""know"" that Searching is far and away one of the best Geek Squad movies of 2018. As something that makes mouse double-clicking, secretive livecasting, MapQuest seeking, and Facebook watching so eerie and intricate, Searching ""searches"" for greatness and nearly achieves it via the belated Age of the Internet. Man if only there was a little more human to human interaction between the pawned characters. Sigh.Anyway, Searching chronicles widower and doting father, David Kim (played by Harold & Kumar vet John Cho). David discovers that his 16-year-old daughter has gone missing. With the help of detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) and the use of said daughter's left behind computer, Kim plays detective himself as he contacts her friends and acquaintances while looking for clues to her whereabouts. So OK, Unfriended is what happens when every confined scene is enhanced through the inkling of someone looking at their upgraded laptop. Oops, I did it again. Wrong pic. I'm talking about Searching (ha-ha), a classy PG-13 thriller in which lead Cho gives a raw, seething performance. Searching is also an exercise in effortless storytelling and triumphant editing due to the flick's re-imagining of a reheated gimmick (every moment is seen through the eyes of bludgeoning, social media and Unfriended, I mean Searching is all the better for it). Rookie director Aneesh Chaganty (he has only done ""shorts"" and ""video shorts"" up until this point) provides meat hook tension, thought out technobabble, and twists and turns you don't see coming. And while Searching may not be completely compelling, it still provides shattering moments that relinquish the factors of gore, suggestive language, and teenage horror remnants. It's a smart, game-guessing refresher that would've qualified as a second-tier Murder, She Wrote had it not been for its superior whiff of World Wide Web/Blair Witch advances. My rating: 3 and a half stars.",Searching
63,rannynm,"Amazing and unique storyline, keeps you on the edge of your seat",9,5 September 2018,"This new drama/thriller grabbed my attention since the beginning, because of its amazing and unique storyline. I felt thrilled to discover what would happen at the end and, whether or not the outcome would be what I expected. I came up with my theory for the conclusion by putting together the clues from the movie, little by little. It is very entertaining, because the film gives the audience an opportunity to be detectives for a moment and try to solve the very unique mystery in the film. The storyline is about a father, David, that enjoys watching his daughter Margot grow up while posting pictures and videos of her to social media, sharing his happiness with his love ones. As Margot enters her teenage years, she starts to grow apart and seem distant from him. One day, she disappears after telling her father that she went to a study group. David looks on the internet to try to find clues about where she may be. Her friends don't seem to know much and don't help either David or the detective that comes on the case to figure out what happened to her and hopefully find her alive. My favorite scene is when David starts to get desperate because of Margot's disappearance, leading to him brainstorming ideas about how to find her. This results with him going into Margot's computer to find answers as to whereabouts. This is my favorite scene because it is very meaningful and is the moment he starts to realize, although he doesn't admit it, that he truly does not know his daughter at all. When he opens her laptop, it is as if he is entering unknown territory and we see the distance between him and Margot. He was very close to her, while she was growing up, but as soon as she hit the teenage years, she became a stranger. The important message in this film is that better communication between family members is encouraged and will improve the dynamics of the family. For example, in the beginning of the movie, the reason for her disappearance is unknown and that leads to the suspense and mystery of the storyline. But, let's say hypothetically that Margot disappeared on purpose, because she was dealing with a problem and, since she had grown apart from her dad, she didn't feel he could help her. If parents, especially those raising their children alone, communicate and interact better, they can help their kids through the tough times. They ease the process of going through conflicts, so that running away is not their only choice. I recommend this film for ages 13 to 18, as well as adults and I rate it 5 out of 5 stars.

(PG-13)Unusual, gimmicky mystery thriller takes place almost exclusively on the screens of computers and cell phones, detailing the efforts of a distraught father (Cho) trying to find his missing daughter (La). The visuals are distracting at first, but as the story becomes more absorbing, they're easy to (almost) forgive and forget--there's just no sensible reason to present the narrative in these terms aside from technological commentary. Full of dead ends and red herrings, the sinuous suspense and Cho's credible central performance grab the viewer's attention and won't let go; those efforts are undermined, however, by a late twist so labored and unlikely that the film never recovers, souring the whole experience.

Aneesh Chaganty's script is strong, the main characters are fleshed out well - yes, we do feel for the struggling dad (played by a terrific John Cho) who thinks he knew his daughter well but didn't.The film primarily revolves around the relationship between Margot (Michelle La) and her widower dad David (Cho) and what transpires when Margot suddenly goes 'missing' - Chaganty entertains us with a brilliantly crafted, multi-layered film that never loses its grip over the audience. We really don't see the final twist coming, and it's one that sticks. It's one that doesn't feel made up or compromised. In fact, the film, as a whole, is mostly cliche-free.When the object of interest is a computer screen, it's slightly easier to deceive the audience. Therefore, even when major revelations are made during critical points in the film, we feel that there's more to come. There could be something more on those social media accounts, something that we missed in Margot's personal folders, a vital clue that may lead to a twist - Chaganty puts these tropes to great effect!I also read that while the filming only took around 2 weeks, the edit and animation work involved an effort of nearly two years.

77,sharky_55,👍,8,4 December 2018,"We've seen this so-called 'gimmick' before, where an entire story is told via digital screens; Open Windows with Elijah Wood, the viral sensation Unfriended, and even Modern Family had its own comedic take on the way parents snoop and keep track of their kid's lives through social media. But Searching is no gimmick. Amongst other things, it shows us the desperate lengths to which parents will go to protect their children, even as they realise that in an increasingly digital age, much of their lives are broadcast to the internet rather than disclosed at the dinner table.That's the conundrum that widow David Kim must go through, having to piece together the puzzle that is his teenage daughter's life after she unexpectedly goes missing one Friday afternoon. It's a grizzled performance from veteran comedian John Cho, who had little to mourn with in the indie drama Columbus, but does well in an atypical setting here. Almost all of his emoting is directed at a webcam, with no eyelines and minimal blocking to work with. Yet Cho sells his sorrow with his gaunt, sunken eyes. There's a particularly haunting moment where he stumbles on what he thinks are the last remnants of his daughter, and it harkens back to the same waves that The Blair Witch Project first made back in 1999. Who knew FaceTime and an grimy Pokeball keychain could be so harrowing? But the shaky, barely-illuminated footage works for a reason. It conveys a universal feeling of dread.So this medium may not be inherently 'cinematic' in the same sense that modern audiences are used to, but it taps into a language that we are all familiar with. We know what the number of likes and comments on a post means for social status, and know to read between the lines of cryptically scarce text message (even if David struggles in his grieving). Rather than allow this to be a limitation, director Aneesh Chaganty wields the vast range of apps and websites at his disposal to keep this thriller taut and engaging (only briefly faltering in some instances where news broadcasts and security camera footage need to be used to advance the story, but our suspension of disbelief is never strained). The digital trail is littered with clues and red herrings alike, and so sometimes it feels inevitable that one of the earlier screens will contain vital information to blow the next step of the case wide open. But that trope's been a mainstay in the genre for decades, starting with the neo-noirs of last century, and then every television police procedural ever. It's effective because when the viewer makes the same deduction as the detective, we're rewarded with the satisfaction. The payoff is in the final reveal.Released a week after Crazy Rich Asians, the film is another big step into Asian representation and normalisation of a minority culture into the mainstream, but it also speaks volumes about the nature of living out our entire lives on social media (season 2 of American Vandal had a similarly sobering message). If you're looking for proof, it's right in front of us; how else could the film have been made without all that material? In-between the snapshots of selfies and smiles of these digital facades, there are so many gaps. It's tragic to see David reach out to his daughter in the only way he knows: bonding through a reality TV show. The ending could have been overly cynical, but I think he proves that he is trying. They both learn important lessons, and deserve to have that second chance at being a family.",Searching
78,educallejero,Pretty nice movie with good twists and turns,6,7 November 2019,"It's not a masterpiece nor it wants to be. It doesn't want to challenge our view of the world. It doesn't have political commentary at all. It is just a thriller of a disappeared girl and the desperation of its father, from the point of view of the father and the heavy influence of social media and internet in our lives.Cho was good. Debra was ok. Some people found some wrong uses of technology (nitpick?). My problem was more about how the first and second acts have really slow/boring segments. But I don't think they damaged the movie at all. It is in fact a good movie, more than anything because of that great third act and the conclusion.",Searching
79,jon.h.ochiai,Human Loss on All Platforms,9,2 September 2018,"Writer and Director Aneesh Chaganty's ""Searching"" poignantly tells the story of human loss through the eyes of all media platforms. It's striking, distinctly disorienting in its imagery. Yet, ""Searching"" possesses undeniable power. In ""Searching"" the unthinkable occurs: Widower David Kim, played by John Cho, discovers that his 16 year-old daughter Margot, played by Michelle La, is missing. David along with assigned Detective Vick, played by Debra Messing, must discern what may have happened to Margot through her Social Media footprint and texts. Concerned David gets that he really doesn't know his daughter in the aftermath of his wife Pam's death.""Searching"" opens with the heartfelt eloquence of ""Up"" or ""Arrival"". Margot is born. FaceTime feeds, Tweet, Facebook posts, texts, and computer screen shots mesmerize telling the story of Margot growing up albeit in grainy resolution. Pam, played by beautiful kind Sara Sohn, loves her daughter and David so dearly. Quietly, Pam loses her battle with lymphoma when Margot is 14 years-old. Although, ""Searching"" is entirely filmed through the sometime dizzying perspective of multi-media platforms either FaceTime or whatever, it's profoundly about the human loss; its impact on all of us. We're all human. We shall all experience loss.David soon discovers through Margot's Social Media footprint, that she was this lonely girl, basically without any real friends. However, Margot was close to David's brother Peter, played by breezy cool Joseph Kim. David's online research fuels abhorrent suspicion in their confrontation in one of the movie's electrifying scenes. In the aftermath, David confesses to Peter that he was waiting for the last couple of years for Margot to come to him and talk about her Mom's death. Peter with compassion in his eyes tells David, ""She wanted you to come to her first..."" David gets it. We get it. Our humanity reveals in our shared loss. Debra Messing is strong conviction as the single Mom Detective Vick, who helps David determine what might have happened to Margot, including the unthinkable. David's immersion into Margot's Social Media presence reveals the young girl in desperate isolation, whose only friendships arise as virtual in the platform ""Youcast"". David's path derails in anger. Fortunately Vick is there to reel him in. However, all is not what it seems in ""Searching"". Eloquently composed, Aneesh and Sev Ohamian's story of ""Searching"" is about the power of compassion. We can never truly know what goes on inside another. Yet, we can have compassion for them. Or at least recognize when we did not. In this narrative message John Cho is sublime, and fiercely vulnerable. John authentically captures David as the man who gets that he never allowed himself to experience the loss of the love of his life, yet expected that both he and his daughter would maintain the stiff upper lip and prevail. This might also be the cultural dynamic as well.Aneesh explicitly tells the story of the Korean American family experiencing tragedy. As Japanese American I get the inherent cultural mandates and constraints. In either Korean or Japanese culture the well of emotions lie just beneath the surface. Instead of suffering and done, suffering sustains in the affect of saving ""face"". John and Michelle are so authentic in their portrayal. That I believe gives ""Searching"" its distinct and unique power. The ending amazes. It shall move. My friend Cheryl taught me, wabi sabi - Beauty lies in the imperfection. ""Searching"" isn't perfect, and that's its distinct beauty. There is the poignancy in loss that completes us; makes us whole. Wisdom allows that to occur. Wisdom is also having compassion for others, especially the ones we think we know too.",Searching
80,RforFilm,"Always keeping us on the edge with more clues and twists, Searching is a very tense mystery that takes full advantage of it's computer setting",10,6 September 2018,"How many of you have ever deleted your Internet history? I'm sure that half of you would say never while the other half would claim ""all the time"". Our computers may hold all of our work and data, but they also contain some of our biggest secrets and even curiosities. What people are worried about is that it'll somehow get out to the public. There are a lot of security programs and computer settings that everyone will setup, but I simply tell people to consider how much your willing to share on your social media platforms. Because we live in an era where we want more followers then friends, many of us do make the mistake to giving away too much about ourselves.With today's movie, we get an understanding of the double edge sword that is the Internet. Yes, we now have a bigger address book of people we can reach. Yes, we can connect further with those with common interests. And yes, we can even use those resources to make ourselves smarter. Unfortunately, there is a lot of people that are willing to take advantage of those that are more naive. That fear is put into motion in Searching. The majority of the movie is all set within computer monitors, smartphones and occasional news footage that all deals with a kidnapping. Software designer David Kim (played by John Cho) sets everything in motion when his teenage daughter Margot (played by Michelle La) goes missing after failing to show up for piano lessons, school, and even a friends camping trip. Of course he calls the police and detective Rosemary Vick (played by Debra Messing) is assigned to help. While doing her work in the real world, she encourages David to look through his daughters digital devices and social media platforms for clues.Some of those things include going through her Facebook and contacting each ""Friend"", only to find out she wasn't really close to her. Further exploration into her computer and email reveal that she's been transferring money to an unknown source and that she feels disconnected from her father after the death of her mother from cancer. David continues to pander Detective Vick and his brother Peter (played be Joseph Lee) for answers as he climbs further into platforms where his daughter was on. Not only does he discover how needy was to make a connection but just how her relationships really were with classmates and family. An entire movie that's told from a computer is nothing new (see me review from the horror film Unfriended), but is alright as long as the story is engaging. Searching is not only a tense thriller, but is a fun mystery to follow along with John Cho. What could have been easy marketing for Facebook and Google is all calculated and feels natural as a clue to each question and mark for the victim. While I'm not a forensics investigator, this is something that I'm sure real detectives deal with everyday in a world where we communicate online as much, if not more, as the real world. Given how raw the material is, you really need an actor that's going to feel real and John Cho is just the right man. Having matured long since his days as Harold, the White Castle seeking pot smoker, he now carries a lot of the burden and terror a lot of parents have with children going into a platform where anything could happen. Even if he's not as competent as his daughter with computers and social media websites, he still trudges though, looking through every digital crack just for any lead for his daughter. Has I been in the same boat, I too would be going through my children's pages and even pulling out a credit card to pay to deep search. In the spirit of good mysteries, where Searching is the strongest is what you don't know. It does the smart thing of not only having a good twist, but several twists that kept throwing me off on what was happening. Once everything is spelled out, it really does make sense and you respect more on how everything was cover rather then how it was found. It feels strong enough to be a modern day Sherlock Holmes tale.I'll give this ten Gmail login pages out of ten. I'm not kidding when I say that searching may be one of the best mystery thrillers I've seen in a while. This reminds me how well these need to be built in order to keep deceiving it's audience. We both care enough to want to see justice, but are rarely sure if we want to know. Give it a watch and then recheck your data online.",Searching
81,cultfilmfan,Searching,10,9 September 2018,"As I age, I find myself having to get used to and adjust to the new norms and ways of filmmaking that are being introduced to us as viewers and critics alike. I had heard great things about this new film, Searching, but as I was watching it and discovered that most if not all of the film was told using various means of social media such as Face Time, YouCast, or various other methods of calling, texting and communicating over the world wide web. To some this probably seemed like an interesting way of telling a story in a radical and brand new way, but to me, I found myself getting a little agitated and also losing interest as I really have no desire to watch, or engage with someone using these various means of communication and nor do I use any of those services myself. I thought the overall film would be lost on me, but I stayed with it and mustered all the patience I had with it and I am glad to say that my perserverance paid off and I started to like this film a lot more and I then started to see that a truly mesmerizing story was taking place in front of me and because of the zeitgeist and times of our day, perhaps this new approach of telling the story was not so useless after all and maybe I was just being too old fashioned and I am glad that I soon found much interest in the story, the film and yes, even the technological approach it took to telling this tale. Searching is not just your run of the mill mystery, or thriller film because I think it is a lot better than that. It takes a story that very easily could have become cliched, or formula ridden and instead gives us something new to look at whilst all the while keeping us the viewers in complete suspense and not only capturing our interest, but truly keeping us guessing as to what and how this mystery would end and I for one could not see the various twists and turns in the film coming and I would go as far as to say they were a very pleasant surprise as well as turning what could have been a mediocre film into a true masterwork. The film knows how to tell a good story and certainly keep everyone guessing as to how it will turn out as well as capturing your interest and holding it throughout the film, but I would also say that this film is a bit of a commentary on several bigger issues that I am very glad were explored through the course of the film. One such issue is again as I have gone on about in various other reviews is the danger of technology and how young people of this generation are getting more and more familiar with it and also at the same time how they seem to be getting less careful with it by exposing much critical and personal information online that could ultimately cause them harm not just to their computer, or online status, but to their personal safety as well. There are a lot of good things to say about computers, the internet and technology, but we can also say that it has taken away communication and has made life in a sense too easy and caused us all to become a lot lazier. I would hate to see how people would communicate and function in society in a generation, or so to come when this will be an even more widespread problem. The other issue that is a key note to this film is the topic of parenting, especially in a day and time where we are too wrapped up with our own lives to truly care about what our children are doing and also just not spending time, or taking an interest in their activities. Parents seem to be reaching out more to their kids in social media platforms, but I would still venture a guess and say that good old fashioned one on one talking is what is needed here and actually taking an interest and being a part of your children's lives is so important and perhaps less tragedies such as the one depicted in this film will soon fade away if we could simply just take the time. Finally in a smaller, but still impactful way, the film shows how the media also has truly taken over and glamorized tragedies and sorrows of other people and how nothing is essentially private anymore, but all made tailor ready for one's viewing pleasure. It's hard not to think that maybe there is a lot of fake news going on and maybe a lot of what they are covering is not nescessarily the truth, but a well written story as well. The acting is very good here particularly by leads John Cho and Debra Messing and I give kudos to the amazingly suspenseful script which uses no violence, or profane material to tell this story and they don't need it either and they provide a film that is not only enthralling, but told in a unique and original way with also a lot to say. I am glad I stuck through the film and it turned out to be one of this year's best achievements and times out at the movies. Highly recommended.",Searching

83,spookyrat1,Boring C.B.S.!,3,17 March 2020,"I'm sorry but I just can't share the love for the admittedly, critical and commercial film success that is Searching. I'm really pleased that John Cho, being an Asian-American, was able to take the lead in a mainstream American made film, for supposedly the first time. I also desperately wish it had been a better quality project than this ""gimmick movie"", which takes place on a mock computer screen. I watch movies because I want to enjoy the sensations involved with watching a film; not end up feeling I've been staring over someone's shoulder at their computer screen for a couple of hours. That's the chief problem with Searching; that and the extremely weak storyline.Very little in the narrative of this film which follows a father (John Cho) trying to find his missing 16-year-old daughter (Michelle La) with the help of a police detective (Debra Messing) appears plausible or realistic. For much of the time ""worried dad David"" just sits in the kitchen on a phone or a computer drinking coffee, feigning anxiety for the missing Margot. 90% of his searching is done from the comforts of home with his fingers doing all the heavy lifting. It doesn't ring true.Neither does the acting, nor actions of Detective Vick. Two things here; Debra Messing can't act to save herself and detectives don't do their interviews via FaceTiming. Straightaway, I was calling ""fake"" on her and so was totally expecting ""the big so-called twist"" when it came, that apparently had sucked in so many other punters and critics. Officers also don't volunteer to run a missing person's task. They are assigned. This sort of stuff was just ridiculous. As was Dave, breaking one young fellow's jaw with seeming impunity, on one of his rare ventures out of his house. And Vick somehow (we are never really told how) persuading an ex-con to falsely admit that he abducted, raped and murdered Margot ... and then to kill himself!!! I could go further, but I think most astute readers will catch my drift.If you are happy watching minutes and more minutes of a movie absent of dialogue or human characters and just seeing various familiar social media windows and panels clicked up there on the big screen, you may well like this film. I don't deny for many, they will appreciate the innovative cinematography and the very obvious post-production that has gone into this work. But for me, this was just a very boring gimmick film, with an extremely weak, unconvincing storyline. I would have much preferred seeing a more traditionally presented film, with far less narrative contrivances, arranged to suit the demands of what many would describe as its ""unique visual presentation"".",Searching

Much of the movie is played out in the style of a computer screen which some people may find annoying, but for me this worked quite well. I'm quite sure this will resonate in particular with parents of children growing up in the technology age.

87,bob-the-movie-man,A phenomenally intriguing social media-focused movie.,10,19 August 2018,"There have been many movies that have featured computing and, more specifically, social media at their heart. Some these have used the device of the view ""from the screen"": 2016's entertaining ""Nerve"" had elements of this, with the majority of the rest of the film being 'augmented reality' over the video. But it was 2014's teen-horror ""Unfriended"" that set a new bar being seen entirely through a computer screen. No surprise then that the producer of that one - Timur Bekmambetov - is also behind ""Searching"". For - although taking a few liberties with news vidoes, that may or may not be showing on Youtube - the whole film is shot through computer screens. ""Oh no!"" you sigh ""another gimmicky B-movie"". Far from it. Not only is this a really helpful training film for Windows tips and tricks! It's also a totally absorbing crime mystery anchored by a superb script that keeps the audience guessing to the end. John Cho - most famous as Sulu in the Star Trek reboots - plays David Kim who is trying to control his 16 year-old daughter Margot (Michelle Ya, in her movie debut). Kim, working in some form of product development, is no technology luddite, and when Margot disappears he uses his nous about social media to try to piece together the fragments of the puzzle to assist police Detective Vick (Debra Messing, ""Grace"" in ""Will and Grace""). To say any more would ruin what is a masterly roller-coaster ride of twists and turns. The script by first-time director Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian doesn't let its audience relax for a moment, spawning more movie cul-de-sacs and red herrings than a classic Agatha Christie. In the acting stakes John Cho - who really doesn't get given much to do in the Star Trek background - is here impressively believable as the parent, struggling with both bringing up a teen - enough to stress any mortal out - and an emotional past. Ms La is also equally engaging, given most of her scenes are via close-up web cam.Criticisms? The film, at 102 minutes, might have usefully trimmed 10 minutes to be an even tighter 90 minute classic. I also thought it pulled its punches in the finale, where a director of the calibre of Hitchcock might have gone for a much darker angle without a qualm. But I'm nit-picking. This is an excellent thriller that also effectively drills into grief and bereavement. It also ironically highlights that whilst broadcasting by people has never been more prevelant, communication between family members has seldom been so lacking. Clearly people agree with me that it is excellent: the preview cinema audience I saw this with was buzzing afterwards, and this won the ""Audience Award"" at Sundance.

As for the others, the film will make a total sense because it's so easy to understand.

John Cho does a phenomenal job as David Kim and goes over the top where you expect him too. Yet, his over-the-topness can sometimes alienate the viewers.

94,msbreviews,Rating: A,9,29 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I only watched a few clips from Searching at the theater while waiting for another film to start, but never fully paid attention to its trailer (after all, I try to avoid those marketing scams every day). From what I had seen, I instantly thought that it was going to flop. An unknown director, an ""ok"" cast and a seemingly straightforward mystery which I guessed it was not going to be that big of a riddle. Furthermore, it was filmed entirely through a laptop or phone camera's perspective.This movie wasn't on my watchlist, but after hearing all the buzz and seeing such great reviews, I decided to give it a shot and OH MY GOD ... Never judge a book by its cover, this is one of the best films I've seen this year! Unbelievable work from debutant Aneesh Chaganty who is able to capture the movie's essence mostly through a webcam. A WEBCAM! Do you have any idea how hard it is to produce a captivating film when all of it is seen through a laptop or a phone?!By far, the most surprising movie of 2018. Aneesh committed himself to his craft and delivered a brilliant mystery, filled with twists and turns. Just think about the premise for a minute: a daughter goes missing. The first question that comes to mind is ""how?"" On one end of the stick, we have the ""she ran away,"" and on the other, we have ""she was kidnapped or killed."" Between those two extremes, Annesh and Sev Ohanian go through every single possibility and sub-possibility.The following question probably is ""who?"" Once again, we have the ""she did it all herself"" but we also have the most common outcomes: ""family did it"" or ""complete stranger got to her."" The writers go through each one, and the mystery never seems to be closer to being solved. I love how I can divide the film into several subplots, where each one corresponds to a potential answer to some of the questions. David Kim investigates each clue with the help of Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing), and both keep eliminating event after event, going through subplot after subplot.This is what a mystery should be. Very rarely we, as the audience, are one step ahead of the characters. If a specific end is discarded, David focuses his attention on another, as we would do. Aneesh cleverly plays with the audience's overall knowledge of generic mysteries, tricking us several times into thinking that we solved it when truthfully we are not even close. When what truly happened is displayed, everything makes sense. There are not any plot holes or questionable motivations. Everything that occurred, no matter how insignificant, has a reason behind it.There's a sense of uniqueness that no other movie ever accomplished with this method of filming. Definitely, the aspect I love the most about Aneesh's craft is how well he shows everything on the laptop. Without a single word or dialogue, he is able to give a backstory to our protagonist's family by merely showing pictures and videos. Even by just moving the mouse pointer over a file or searching for a word on the Internet, the character development in this film is outstanding and incredibly fresh.Most of what helps move the plot forward is through something we see. Not hear, not lazily exposed by a character, but either through a simple message or a notification from an antivirus program. Every ounce of story's detail is remarkably exhibited through so many different computer's features that we never thought it was possible to tell such an interesting story like this. Searching deserves tons of praises for its jaw-dropping storytelling method, and Aneesh should receive some awards for his terrific work.One final compliment to Aneesh's screenplay. I was scared that the fact that this movie is from Sony that I would witness tons of product placement. Fortunately, Aneesh is smart enough to avoid being on-the-nose or slightly obvious when giving a certain product its marketing. There's never a feeling of being inside a big commercial for Apple, Microsoft or whatever. Yes, there's Google Chrome, Facetime and other apps we know, but not even for a second the focus changes. The features are there to provide a modern and realistic vibe to a mysterious story and never to advertise themselves.The tone and pacing are beautifully handled. While you might be worried that the camera's perspective may get a bit tiresome, the fact that the film moves quickly will at least attenuate your concern. I was visually delighted by what I was witnessing, but I understand if it gets too much for some people to manage. Tonally, there's never a misstep. Aneesh keeps the dramatic vein pumping, and the mystery is always delivering new hints and puzzles to solve.Cast-wise, John Cho is emotionally amazing. From the suspenseful expressions looking for some clue on a laptop to the tension and emotion that he brought to so many scenes, he elevates the screenplay and his character to a superior level. So, story-wise and technically speaking, this movie is almost flawless ... Almost. I genuinely thought of giving Searching an A+, but my stupid brain has two nitpicks that I can't just ignore.One is related to the mystery itself. I wrote above that rarely the audience is in front of the characters. Well, there is a plot point that is kind of obvious, but it takes both David and the cops too much time to realize that they have a pretty explicit clue of where Margot might be. I know that they would get there and that they had some other hints to follow, but it still feels doubtful that they wouldn't start right off with that.The other nitpick has to do with Aneesh's commitment to the film's perspective. I do praise and congratulate him for filming such a captivating story through this wonderful method. However, since everything we see is through a camera, there are a couple of moments that feel forced, like leaving a laptop's lid open when 95% of the times people close it or leaving a window opened with a stream of a particular location where the characters are going to be. I hate myself for these nitpicky details, but I really want to save my A+ for the right movie(s).All in all, Searching is one hell of a surprise! Undoubtedly, one of the best films of 2018 and from a first-time director, Aneesh Chaganty! A tremendously unique style of filming elevates an almost seamlessly written mystery, containing constant twists and puzzling clues that leave the audience captivated throughout the entire runtime. Filled with contemporary details and a mind-blowing use of a simple mouse pointer to develop both story and characters. I don't have enough words to describe how amazing this movie is. Go see it now, and you won't be disappointed!",Searching

97,MrDHWong,An unconventional edge-of-your-seat thriller that never disappoints,9,6 December 2018,"Searching is a mystery film co-written and directed by Aneesh Chaganty. Starring John Cho and Debra Messing, it is an unconventional edge-of-your-seat thriller that never disappoints.In San Jose, California, David Kim (John Cho) has a strained relationship with his teenage daughter Margot (Michelle La) ever since her mother Pam passed away from leukaemia two years prior. One day, Margot goes missing and David desperately searches through her laptop for clues as to what could have caused her disappearance. After finding nothing helpful for over 36 hours, David files a missing persons report and Detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) is assigned to assist him in tracking down Margot's last whereabouts.Suspenseful and well-made, Searching near-perfectly makes the most of its simple, low-budget (US$1 Million) premise to become one of the best mystery thriller films in years. It is just so rare for a film of this type to elicit such an amount of tension in the viewer and not be seen as nothing more than a cheap marketing stunt, which is often what happens nowadays. Each time it feels like the mystery has been solved, the film will often throw in a red herring to keep the case going until the real answers become clear. There's no cheating either, all of the clues are there. In a rather unorthodox move, the film is told entirely from the perspective of computer screens, iPhones, and YouTube clips, but this never once feels gimmicky or awkward thanks to the creative direction of newcomer Aneesh Chaganty. Instead, we are given a clever commentary of how modern technology has changed the way society view news stories and the way in which social media spreads it. John Cho does a brilliant job holding the film with his convincing performance as a desperate father wanting to reunite with his daughter, and Debra Messing is also worth mentioning as the detective doing everything she can to solve the case.I rate it 8.5/10",Searching

101,andrewroy-04316,An absolutely brilliant movie with innovative editing and a story that works both as an emotional film about parenting and a well-crafted thriller,9,29 January 2019,"To call Searching a ""gimmick film"" is unfair to the intelligence and care given to the layers of the plot and emotional pull of the film. At its heart, Searching is a classic, well developed mystery thriller, and if that's all it was I would consider it a strong movie. The mystery is never obvious, has lots of possibilities and factors to consider, great red herrings, an excellent twist that is a satisfying solution, and the best part of the mystery aspect is all the small details that hint at it and you realize looking back. While I could go deeper into what makes the mystery great, the reason Searching is among the best 2018 films I've seen is the emotional attachment we develop with David and the societal commentary it subtly makes in its very accurate characterization of family life in the social media age. While their tones and plots couldn't be more different, many times watching it I was struck by the similarity I felt to Eighth Grade, and I think they found success showing the integration of technology and family interactions through each movie's excellent editing. Searching was probably the best edited movie I saw all year, from the early sequence that immediately builds a connection to the family to the clever ways of maintaining its technology lens in scenes like his visit to Peter's house. The only flaw at all in the movie is the ending, and even that isn't a plot hole or serious issue so much as an imperfect explanation of what happened. The events are plausible - one character just isn't thinking because of the shock and concern they're feeling, so they act a bit irrationally. Once you get over that minor lapse of judgement, it makes sense, even if it didn't feel as seamless and perfectly crafted as everything that came before it. Still, I didn't feel disappointed or let down by that scene, it was just fine and unremarkable, and in no way does it affect my overall consideration of the film. Watch it as a clever thriller that you have the clues for but are unlikely to solve, watch it for the creative technology in society commentary and great editing, or watch it for the emotional and thoughtful family/parenting story. Whatever the reason, just watch it, for you will not be disappointed.",Searching

105,sweidman-28016,"Interesting ""Found Footage""",8,28 October 2018,"Searching Review:Searching is a new thriller about a father trying to figure out why his daughter, Margot, has gone missing through her computer. This movie intrigued me because it was a cool concept and they used the point of view of the computer like few movies including Unfriended and The Den. I really liked this movie. It was was a cool mystery and it was interesting the whole time. John Cho as David Kim did such a wonderful job. You could feel real emotion and his frustration. Debra Messing played Detective Vick and she did a good job too. Going back to the whole computer point of view, I thought it worked well for this film. You can see David write what's on his mind through texts and delete it like how people do every day. It also was a movie that payed rights to use real company names like Google, Facebook, and Apple. Because I thought it was supposed to be a found footage movie, there is a score to it with a nice piece at the beginning. It really bugged me at first but then I realized it wasn't found footage. It's just a film with a cool perspective. Now this movie has a big twist at the end that people were talking about and saying how amazing it was. I just must be pretty smart (as I do watch a lot of movies) where I predicted most of the twist. Everyone else in the theater was talking about how they didn't see it coming but I found it to be a bit predictable so I wasn't as surprised. There were some parts of the movie where I kind of wished it wasn't in the perspective of the computer but I was fine how it was going. This is a pretty good thriller movie, one of the better recent ones, and I think people should see it. I drove down to Madison to see it at a theater because it wasn't playing anywhere near here, but it is coming to theaters around here tomorrow and there were some premiers earlier this night.

Initially I thought this was quite restricting and a bit off putting, but after about 15 minutes I was fully on board with the way that they opted to tell this story.The impressive part of this film really is how it is told, through screens, online messaging/videos and video chats. As mentioned I've never seen a film like this before, and it brought a real sense of eeriness at times to the film. Using text messages in place of dialogue and as exposition could have come off as clunky and awkward but worked remarkably well in Searching, managing to build tension and intrigue really well. As a result of this Searching feels like a very minimalist and restrained thriller which sets it apart from films of a similar ilk. Full credit to the director and creative team for putting this together.In terms of the plot it was solid. There were several good twists and turns, although I did think it was always a little too obvious when we were being dealt a red herring. If the film was able to more effectively disguise this it could have been better. This isn't to say there wasn't a good level of mystery, which was sustained really well throughout the film. A perfect length really for this genre.John Cho also put in a great performance as the increasingly desperate father, putting a strong and convincing level of emotion into the role.What more to say other than Searching is a very solid and engaging mystery thriller which will keep you guessing for its duration, displaying some artful and unique storytelling along the way.",Searching

They all felt like the writer's caricatures. The detective was condescending which would never happen. None of the calls felt real, because they were rushed. The phone barely rang before a pickup and no one could type that fast to text.The whole thing was too claustrophobic with just the computer screen telling the story. I admire them for trying something new but it was annoying.The daughter had no apps installed on her computer? Nah, don't buy it. The dad figured out her password in one try? Come one, man.Debbie Messinger was so annoying. She talked like Hal from 2001, so wooden and robotic. I didn't buy for one second she was a detective, nor did I buy that personal relationship she developed with David and FaceTiming him from her home. You want me to believe they had a detective on the case within 24 hours and she was FaceTiming David giving updates from her bedroom? And she cried during a FaceTime? Come on, man.Margo's character had zero personality and no energy, which made her super boring to watch.Then the dad started screaming at the kids and interrogating them? Come one, man. Nothing made any sense. For example, they showed NO reason for why Margot would live a secret life despite having a close relationship with her dad from all the home videos growing up.Sorry dragging an image into google doesn't result in a bunch of other images from that person.This is the problem with plot movies. No character or relationship developments. All plots but without any emotional connection to any of them.If you are going to make a movie like this, make it believable.

The different modes of communication are integratedseamlessly. Today's younger generations use technology with ease to interact with peers, as well as conceal certain truths, projecting only an image they deem fit to display. In the film, we see how young people may take advantage of these platforms to express themselves in an honest way online that they simply cannot do in the company of a parent. i think movie is so good for parents to look after their kids in soical media, it shows how person for explame guy can find beautiful girl in google imagines and then puts it in profile but it's girl online but in real life it's guy with fake identity, fake name everything profile name and account is all fake. that's how i want every parent or older brother or sister to watch their love ones to be careful of what your kids are doing in social media that's what movie is trying to show, like movie unfriended is good for bully's not to bully anyone on Online. well for this movie for parents to watch your kids in this generation what they are doing online who they are talking to strangers online, this is type of movie it's showing. espite the unprecedented access people now have to one another, whether by phones, screens, or text, does the communication itself between us really improve? What is the definition of a friend in this digital world, when the term friend is so casually used? And what, if any, are the differences between our ""real-life"" persona, and the ""digital"" one we choose to create?

While this may be true, there are also some elements of the film that don't feel too exploitive.John Cho's portrayal of a frantic father who must find his lost daughter using clues pieced together from her social networks is admirable. As you can imagine, this is not an easy role to play, and requires being able to tap into a wide range of emotions. We get to learn about his daughter, Margot (Michelle La), at the same time that he does - through numerous video clips, recorded chat sessions, Facebook posts and many other documentation. Throughout this discovery period, Cho demonstrates he's a serious actor - not just Harold Lee.Of course, the fact that all video content that 'Searching' is based on is through second-screen video from - FaceTime sessions to broadcast news streams to live streaming chat sites - is unique. It doesn't make the movie, but it also adds something else to it. That said, the plot is limited and falls into the same trap that mystery dramas often will, with a ridiculous twist that comes out of nowhere and a cliched climax.If 'Searching' does nothing else, it should raise awareness about the dangers of social media, as well as the ways it can also help us in trying times.",Searching

All in all, Aneesh Chaganty's directorial debut intelligently makes use of modern technologies to meticulously construct an intriguingly mysterious investigation, and even if the viewer witnesses the admittedly simple story and learns about the characters only via screens and chats, both aspects are extremely well elaborated, since the film knows to utilize its practical features masterfully, and thus it becomes an unexpectedly tricky, twisted and compelling thriller that exhausts all of its possibilities and delivers an unconventional but undeniably intense experience that will definitely leave many speechless.

The reason why I became aware of this flick is that its trailer was part of the preview of a film I was watching recently, and I gotta tell you, already those roughly two minutes were extremely promising to me, hence I tried to track it down and saw that it was on Netflix, at least until the end of the month. I previously heard many things about it, from many sources I personally trust, but honestly, none of the things that were said in fact do this film justice. I know, this type of film that takes place only on technological devices and via screens is not everyone's cup of tea, but just like ""found footage"" films (of which this sub-genre is the spiritual successor), I simply loved the way it was constructed. Funnily enough, I watched this film via my own laptop, what kind of made the experience even better. In my opinion, the reason why this movie works out so well is that it is utterly realistic: it is an ordinary case, of an ordinary family located in an ordinary place - there is nothing supernatural about it, nothing unrealistic and most importantly, no horror - you feel terrified simply by the way it is narrated, because all the devices, ways of communication and websites are non-fictitious and known to the everyday user of the internet. I think this extreme closeness to reality is a crucial factor to its effectivity. Already in the first ten minutes, when we learn about the early history of the Kim family, I felt like crying, cause despite its shortness, this scene packs a punch. The entire evolution of the family goes hand in hand with the technology shown, and seriously, I nearly sobbed, because we get to see the ups and downs of the Kim household that ends with the tragic and untimely death of the mother Pam. Two years after the tragedy is where is films sets in: John Cho convincingly plays the worried father David who tries to investigate the sudden vanishing of his only daughter Margot, and even if that sounds like nothing, the film processes this premise unexpectedly ingeniously. On the outside, it is mystery thriller, but there is a devastating drama in its core that defines the plot tremendously. Cleverly, the director shows how David, who kind of lost himself after his wife's death, tries to find his daughter and learns about her a lot. It is kind of sweet how he is overchallenged by the technology his child uses, and yet it is extremely smart how he manages to overcome the obstacles, nevertheless. Within a few days he uncovers so many things he didn't know about, learns about websites and apps he has never used, and, most shockingly, finds out that his daughter lead a totally different life. What amazes me tremendously about this movie is how it never becomes boring once and instead manages to find innovative ways to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Multiple times, I got lead astray, many times the details are in the subtleties and all the time I didn't know what was going on. Seriously, the film is inscrutable to the very end, and I for one didn't see the twist coming at all. Did I say twist? I meant twists, plural! Yes, believe it or not, there are several twists in the end that outdo the brilliance of the previous one each time. What I furthermore loved about this film is how it didn't hesitate to express social criticism as well: after it has become a big issue, the media report on the case constantly, and all of the sudden, all the people that disliked Margot, who turned out to be a loner, pretend to be her friends and act like they are important just to get media attention. Oh, and that is raises awareness to the dangers of social medias as well as viral videos is another thing. However, no matter what it thematizes, all the time it is extremely compelling and remains on the same level of brilliance, and honestly, it constantly grabbed me by the feelings and turned into an emotional rollercoaster. In the end, it is one of those underappreciated flicks that I completely underestimated, cause let's face it, this film was a downright masterpiece. Yeah, some may find my rating to be slightly too high, but I assure you, it has been a while since a thriller has hit me this tremendously. It has got a lot of heart, likeable characters and a twisted plot that takes your breath away. It becomes even more magnificent afterwards when you find out that many little hints that in fact give away the ending have been placed right in the beginning. Oh, and has anyone else noticed the reports about the ongoing alien invasion that apparently takes place at the same time? Anyway, this film is an intense and emotional masterpiece - highly recommended!",Searching
123,gavinp9,Interesting and unique mystery.,7,6 October 2018,"'Searching' is very much a film of the times - an inventive concept of always being viewed through a screen -computer, phone, FaceTime, YouTube, TV, etc. It's directed by first-time director Chaganty, who's only 27, and does make you realise how much screen-time occupies our lives these days. Thankfully, rather than a film with just this gimmick, it's actually a well-made mystery/thriller. David (Cho) is struggling to connect with his teenage daughter, Margot (La), after his wife passes away (nice montage to start the film). As I imagine most teenagers do these days, she mostly communicates with him by text, so once he hasn't heard from her for more than a day, he starts to get worried. Detective Vick (Messing) and Peter (Lee), his brother, get involved in trying to find out who her friends were, via Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc.The film does well to lead you along David's logic as he's trying to find his daughter and Cho is good at showing his anguish. There's a few good twists and some nice tension at times. Great final 15min - the entire film's well-paced and keeps you on the hook throughout.",Searching

Look for it in the cinemas,7,14 October 2018,"A 16-year-old girl (Michelle La) goes missing and her dad (John Cho) starts his own investigation, searching the one place no one has considered yet - the girl's computer. Also starring: Debra Messing, Joseph Lee, Sara Sohn.""Searching"" is an impressive debut by one Aneesh Chaganty who directed and co-wrote this multi-faceted story which works equally well as thriller and drama.The storytelling is pretty straightforward but the unique thing is how it's done. Mostly everything is shown through picture within picture - the screen is filled with video chats, TV footage, home videos, security camera content, and various web app interfaces, such as Gmail and Facebook.On paper, this sounds rather lifeless, and one surely is tempted to call the execution an one-trick pony - but the trick turns out to be impressive indeed.Witnessing somebody's life on the screen (mostly we just see one guy using apps and web-services on phones or computers) can be surprisingly captivating.The authors have found a variety of approaches to portray all that swiping, typing and clicking in a way that does not put the viewer to sleep, or at least make one disconnect mentally.I have seen very few movies about modern digital technology which feel thought-provoking but also visually interesting, and ""Searching"" surely is the new benchmark of any work of this kind. The director surely deserves an Oscar nomination for pure inventiveness. It's amazing how much he makes the viewer relate to the main character emotionally just by showing him use the computer.Here and there we even get some biting social satire about how (social) media can bring out the selfishness and shallowness of human nature but the authors don't hammer it home, and let the more sharp-eyed find it as small pleasure.But buried underneath all the digital stuff, we also find a authentically moving human drama about parent and child relationships, and a man who just can't let go.Soaked in fear and desperation, he never surrenders to bitter reality that there's seemingly nothing more to be done than wait and hope for the best.John Cho is great in this role. Who knew the Asian dude from all these mainstream movies such as ""Harold & Kumar"" or ""Star Trek"" is actually that impressive an actor.I especially loved how much of his internal struggles are conveyed by not words or facial expressions but just bodily positions: how he sits, stands etc.Most of the time, he's the main or only actor on screen, and he commands this space like a master. Easily as worthy of an Oscar nomination as Chaganty's directing work.The final chapter feels like a bit of a letdown, at least compared to what's happened before. But thanks to committed performances, the story never loses that critical amount of emotional heft that makes one care about the characters.",Searching
128,jb_campo,Awesome thriller - spellbinding!,8,29 April 2019,"Searching tells the story of David Kim (John Cho - Star Trek), loving father of Margot (Michelle La), as he searches for his daughter who goes unexpectedly missing while in high school.This movie tells much of the story via the computer and phone screens of today's social media. What an incredibly interesting medium. David ventures into apps he's never used, searching for clues. He finds various devices from Margot and starts doing a deep dive into an unknown world - the internet.Detective Vick (Debra Messing) gets assigned to the case. She has a long record of finding missing people and throws herself actively into the search for Margot. Along the way the plot twists and turns you inside out and around again. You learn about how Margot was affected by her mother, and influenced. You learn that maybe you don't always know your kids as well as you think. You learn that the internet is not always a nice place to venture.There's not much for cinematography here, but actually, the screen medium beautifully shows you the inner thoughts of the father as he clicks around, thinks, changes his mind, what is he doing, oh, he's thinking this. The screen views throw you so many red herrings, you are not quite sure who is guilty of what, or not guilty of anything.Cho is terrific as the father, with all the emotion you would expect from a father whose only daughter goes missing. Michelle La is terrific too for such a young actress, as Margot. And for the short time on screen, Sara Sohn as the Mom Pam is also really good. Messing delivers a solid job as the Detective too.Acting is great. The plot is terrific - complex, scary, defeating, and maybe hopeful. You go thru so many twists.

129,WalkdenEntertainment,"If your Searching for a creative film, you've found it...",9,15 November 2018,"Perhaps you've never heard of this film. It is in fact a new release which I feel has gone somewhat under the cinema radar with a very short and limited release within Australia. Thankfully I had the honour of witnessing the directorial debut of Aneesh Chaganty in cinemas before it ran away from the big screens. Searching is in fact a thriller.After a father's 16-year-old daughter appears to have gone missing, the father decides to take a look at her laptop. As he browses though her computer, he soon discovers a world of mysteries and clues that will allow him to hopefully discover what has actually happened to her.By the way, I forgot the mention... the film is done completely with the cinema patrons only seeing ""computers screens"" which in fact show different elements, different cameras, Skype calls and the list goes on. Yes, you heard right... the entire film and its story is shown like this.While the film is set around computer functions (like current operating systems and older ones) we also see popular programs and apps such as Facebook and Instagram which many viewers will relate to (young and old). I was rather impressed with just how much was I able to truly connect with this film, especially as we ourselves have used all (or most of) what we see in this film. It's clear to me that the director has in fact invested money towards brand licensing to give the film a true realistic look given the situation. And you know what? It flipping works!A film that is told from the point of a computer screens does sound boring when you read about it on paper. But in the cinema, I was shocked and completely impressed by this feature. At no point did the film drag, feel dull or feel uninteresting. Once the situation of the daughter being missing appears, I was highly invested and cheering the father on, happy to join him in trying to discover more about his daughter's odd disappearance. The view of the computer screen only makes you feel like you too are looking for clues, plus it only increases the level of both hype and suspense. The pace was also perfect as I was able to keep up, read all the text on screen and see everything. At no point did I feel like I missed out on any detail.The next day after watching the film I found myself continuing to think about it. And certain elements in this film may seem a little too much to accept, but in the moment, I found myself believing it because it all looked and felt realistic. I will also admit that the character/actor was a little weak, and at times didn't feel believable in the character they played (truly, it's minor negative for me).Overall, Searching delivers one of the most creative and suspenseful thrillers I have seen in 2018. It's story alone is unique, suspenseful and creative. The way the director chooses to tells the story is risky, but oh boy it works a treat here.9.0/10

It has been a while since I was so riveted and drawn in to a mystery thriller in this way trying desperately to figure out and uncover the truth of the mystery. Which is a sign of this film's brilliance, the way that the film is set up, while on paper may sound like another one of those 'gimmick' films but in reality works to its favour and aids the story telling. I am of course referring to the fact that this film is told through the lenses of the technology, webcams, CCTV, cameras, phones. This film takes the angle of these everyday things and tells its story in this way throughout. The reason why I think this actually works to the film's favour is that it manages to make the already brilliant acting seem even more authentic and genuine, because there isn't a sense of being on a movie set but there is a sense of realism and a sense that you as an audience is peering into the lives of these people. This realist approach is captured so brilliantly as the use of technology goes into such fine details. The filmmaker took notice of the apps that we use, the internet trends and all of this comes together to form a brilliant backdrop to the film that exuberates authenticity. But all this only goes to elevate John Cho's performance in this film, the way he conveys emotions is especially fascinating to watch. Especially considering that most of the time when we see him he is reacting to the computer screen. His facial expressions of distraught, confusion, pain and worry is so brilliantly acted out in this film that is bound to be one of if not the best John Cho performances. Pitch that with a mystery that is filled with twists and turns that ends in the final reveal that was smart and unpredictable, we have ourselves a wonderful thriller.",Searching

What I wasn't fully impressed with was the acting. John Cho wasn't able to pull my strings and pick up the right chord so I was left unsatisfied with his performance.

Dick's Electric Dreams"" or ""Rick and Morty"" have made it plain: unstoppable technology is naturally the next step for human evolution, but also the next for automatic annihilation. For this reason, not all people find a door to a new dimension in this generation's tech breakthroughs. In this cybernetic roulette, a unison click equals life itself.As TV format has dissected the toxicity and clear danger of mixing artificiality and humanity, the silver screen, with a shorter range of time and a playbook to stick with, has chosen to delve into cinematic spectacle skipping from the lightest ( ""Tron"" by Joseph Kosinski or ""Ghost in the Shell"" by Rupert Sanders), bloodiest tone ( ""Unfriended: Dark Web"" by Stephen Susco or ""Upgrade"" by Leigh Whannell) to the most formal, thought-provoking philosophical and social examination (""The Social Network"" by David Fincher, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" by Stanley Kubrick, ""The Matrix "" by Lilly and Lana Wachowski, ""Ex Machina"" by Alex Garland and even ""Black Panther"" by Ryan Coogler).""Searching,"" trapped in-between, is a restless thriller that weaves mystery through every-day tech devices, in the style of Blumhouse Productions' awkwardly entertaining found-footage derivate ""Unfriended."" But what sets apart the Sony Pictures/Screen Gems flick from the fatuous average matinée and places it between one and another category is how much three-dimensional treatment it employs to build an effectively paced family drama packed as a Hitchcockian pic of modern-day underpinnings. Gifting a pertinent, compelling final turn for anyone going to the cinema, this cyber-crime mystery-thriller is, besides the perfect vehicle to deliver a brilliant performance by the leading actor, an introspective, absorbing and effective offering that will delight followers of this emerging sub-genre.Winning the Audience Award and the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize for his directional debut at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, Aneesh Chaganty deftly breaks into the good-thriller scene balancing visceral tension building and dramatic storytelling that, although simple in concept, shapes a well-timed writing according to its purposes. Director Chaganty fully knows the kind of story he wants to tell, therefore manages to get on the audience's nerves with a modern, uncomplicated verve that never finds in excess the answers it needs. Co-writing alongside Sev Ohanian, these two relatively novel screenwriters test their most inventive skills to assemble an electrifying, tech-influenced whodunit/whydunnit that faces a short crisis of cogency halfway through.
Moreover, some comical punches are masterfully distributed throughout the first two acts, injecting into the story a vibe of freshness and levity never colliding with the in crescendo tension and the convincing drama.Slightly approached by some other films, it depicts adolescence with palpable veracity, avoiding teen-life problems as bullying or suicide to delve deep into introspection and media abuse by means of youthful characters that play the same stereotypes with relatable confidence, these teenagers belong entirely to our world, which helps considerably in the credibility the film seeks to reap.The script is the agent that better works for the idea thanks to the three-dimensional, kind-of grounded drama, never unbalanced towards melodrama or pastiche, always enriching the relationships between characters. Don't waste time waiting for the most buoyant revelation of the darkest youthful secrets nor hi-tech sequences with explicit violence, there is more well-aimed drama than breathtakingly intense suspense in this story about a fractured father-daughter relationship, the family life between mirrors gestated since a painful past event.The fact that a single actor holds the entire film together speaks volumes, indeed, says it all. John Cho, Hikaru Sulu in the rebooted ""Star Trek"" trilogy, is an actor who takes quite seriously his job, his latest true proof. He's not in front of the ""camera"" all the time, but still, the actor delivers a fantastic performance, rich in nuances, interchangeable in purpose. The ""FlashForward"" actor looks, and acts, as a fairly bona fide modern-day father who tries to get along with his reclusive daughter, neither slipping into over-the-top comedy nor verging on saccharine following the fascinating, heavy-hearted opening montage. His committed performance certainly strengthens the idea, getting we're worried and intrigued at once; his search, instinctively, is ours as well.Debra Messing delivers a good performance likewise, both as a police detective as a single parent. The Emmy Award-winning actress' character features a sharp wrinkle and a plus challenge that pushes her to drive the story quietly, at least, up until the not-so-shocking twist comes in. Rosemary Vick, her character, instantly reminds us of detective Kim Dickens from David Fincher's marriage ode because of her strong nature and physical resemblance.Nine producers on board, it's hard to reckon how much money it costed, even with three production companies not entirely unknown overseas. Roughly speaking and based on conjectures, it might be slightly higher than ""Unfriended""'s $1 million budget, its main reference. That being the case, Sony did not think twice about paying $5 million for its world rights at Sundance earlier this year; an investment that, thanks to the genre, the innovative setting and the raving critics coming out from the fests, will be easily recovered in the first week of release.Unlike many people think, cinematography in this genre of geometric anatomy and websites does matter. Cinematographer Juan Sebastian Baron keeps an accessible, deliberately careless digital visual style - mostly - true to a teenage girl's laptop. A new film crew category has emerged from this movie: virtual photography, which is run by Will Merrick and Nicholas D. Johnson.A solid, understated editing work for this found-footage ramification is primal, therefore, the very same directors of virtual photography are editors here setting up one hour and forty-two minutes of clicks, pop-ups, chats, FaceTime video calls compelling because of the flowing, intriguing development the narrative seeks not to neglect. Torin Borrowdale's soundtrack conflates the sinister investigation-kind melodies and synthetic-yet-exciting sounds of artificiality, honoring its nature of virtual environment without fear.
""Searching"" by Aneesh Chaganty is not as wildly unpredictable nor is it original as many critics claim, it's a timely digital-era drama varnished with unexpected suspense gimmicks with enough strong suits to become a time-worthy, enjoyable experience for parents and teenagers alike, for viewers committed to scrutinizing under its taut virtual thriller layer. With a formidable performance by John Cho, an emotionally and strategically geared screenplay, a truly great direction which balances the mainstream and the indie, and a suitable soundtrack, this family drama set on screens has something to say, at least, up until before the third act.",Searching

The film follows a dad trying to find his daughter who goes missing without a trace one day, and through her laptop screen, we then see everything he sees and every clue he finds to Margot's disappearance. Unlike Unfriended which made you feel like you were missing out on half of the film when someday would do something you couldn't see, this movie captured everything we needed, like how at one scene when the dad leaves, we then see that scene through a news report or something where he's gone doing whatever where as if it was Unfriended, the character would just leave and leave it be. The only problem I had was kind of the ending bit where it was all revealed, SPOILERS, I feel like how it turned out to be the detectives son was a bit of a let down and I really feel like they could have done something else like maybe it was some sort of organisation that killed young girls or it could have ended in a turn of events like Taken, he goes a bit out of the country and finds her with men like or something, I didn't necessarily mind the ending, I just felt there could have been more to it.

Also the gimmick of the film (the found-footage aesthetic) doesn't take away from the quality, in fact, it adds to it; it resonates well with our current technology-based society. The finale's big ""reveal"" is absolutely ingenius; it truly echos with the film's ongoing theme.

147,Bertaut,"Rubbish plot, but aesthetically well crafted",7,9 September 2018,"Searching is a film with two main organisational principles; there's the thriller plot, which ostensibly keeps everything moving, and to which everything else should, in theory, be in service. Then there's the aesthetic design, with the entire film taking place online, the images presented taking the form of what is seen on computer screens, iPhones, security cameras etc. One of these principles is exceptionally well handled, the other isn't, and it shouldn't take a genius to guess which is which. If we're being really honest, in fact, the plot becomes more and more incidental as the narrative progresses and ever more ludicrous flights of fancy are introduced, transposing the story from a search for a missing girl into a litany of clichés and melodrama. On the other hand, the main reason, indeed probably the only reason any of us saw the film at all is because of its unique visual schema, and thankfully, this aspect is realised with an impressive degree of craft. You know you're in reasonably secure territory when the filmmakers are self-aware enough to begin an online film depicting the latest in consumer technology with the sound of an old dial-up connection.Written by Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian, and directed by Chaganty, the film begins with a montage of video clips depicting various events in the recent lives of David Kim (John Cho), his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn), and their daughter Margot (Michelle La). The montage covers several years, taking in Margot's childhood, Pamela's diagnosis with cancer, the disease going into remission, her relapse, and, finally, her deterioration and eventual death. This brings us up to roughly the present day, with Margot now a teenager who has drifted apart from her father, although David himself doesn't seem to have noticed. In the early hours of the morning on a night when Margot left the house to attend a study group, she calls David three times, but he is asleep and doesn't hear the phone. Seeing the missed calls the next morning, and realising Margot isn't in the house, he tries to call her back, but her phone is turned off. Assuming she left early to attend a piano lesson, he calls the teacher, but she tells him Margot cancelled the lessons six months prior. Thereafter, he discovers that the money he had been giving her for her lessons was instead being deposited into her bank account, and, several weeks ago, the entirety was transferred to a now deactivated Venmo account. Frantic, David reports her missing, with the case assigned to Det. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing). However, as David and Vick begin to delve deeper into Margot's life, David is shocked to learn she has no friends at school, and has instead an online existence of which he knew nothing. Meanwhile, every investigative avenue seems to throw up another mystery, and as time passes, it begins to look more and more as if Margot has simply run away. David, however, refuses to believe this, with his wildly vacillating suspicions regarding who may have been behind her disappearance ranging from a friendly YouCast (video blogging site) user, a disrespectful pot-smoking Facebook user, his own brother Peter (Joseph Lee), and everyone in between.Although the plot has a reasonably strong forward momentum, with a well-judged pace, it comes across as initially insipid, and ultimately rather ridiculous. If this was a standardly shot film, without the unique visual design, no one would be giving it a second glance - the thriller plot is clichéd, derivative, and trite, and despite the foolishness into which it descends, it's also fairly predictable (I guessed who the villain was, although not why they were so villainous). In this sense, the film reminds me of something like Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake (1946) or Sebastian Schipper's Victoria (2015). Both feature dull and hackneyed plots that serve only as something onto which to hang the structure, rather than the other way around; Lady in the Lake is shot entirely in the first-person, whilst Victoria is shot in a single continuous take, and neither is worth looking at for their plot, characters, or dialogue.With this in mind, the aesthetic aspect of Searching is much more successful, with almost the entire film taking place on a computer screen, with Facetime conversations, iPhone messages, security camera footage, and TV material rounding out the design. It's a fascinating hook, and thankfully, it does more than simply exist to carry a poorly written plot - the filmmakers actually have something to say, albeit nothing too revolutionary.The first thing to know is that the aesthetic is extremely well crafted; from Chaganty's direction to Juan Sebastian Baron's cinematography, to, especially, Nicholas D. Johnson and Will Merrick's editing; logistically, this can't have been an easy film to plan or shoot, and the fact that the various components that go into making up the final image all work so well together suggests a great degree of care. In tandem with this, whilst the overarching plot is poor, Chaganty and Ohanian's writing is excellent in terms of how it continually finds natural ways to confine the action to a screen - whether it's David looking into Margot's finances, Vick watching FaceTime conversations, TV news showing security footage - never once did it feel like a gimmick, like it was being forced to stay within the computer screen simply to satisfy an abstract aesthetic rubric. It all worked reasonably organically, and after a few minutes of acclimating yourself, you barely even register it anymore.Within this, the filmmakers are even able to throw up a few surprises. For example, the structure grants us more access to David's interiority than would be possible in a regular film. How so? Simple - by employing something we've all done, many times. On several occasions, David is shown typing something during a conversation, only to delete it, and send something completely different, whether because the first message was angry, or emotionally revealing, or accusatory etc. Anyone who has spent any amount of time talking online or via text will be familiar with this, and the use of it in the film allows us a glance into his psyche, showing us where his mind is in an unfiltered sense, before self-censorship kicks in. It only happens a few times (if it happened too much, it would become meaningless), but it really does impart a degree of psychological verisimilitude that I wasn't expecting.Additionally, as mentioned earlier, the film actually uses the visual design to offer some social commentary, which is, again, something I wasn't expecting. Chaganty himself is a former Google Creative Lab employee, so he would know a thing or two about issues such as the uses and over-uses of technology, the unpleasant side of online culture, and the notion of digital footprints, and it is these areas where most of the film's more salient points are concentrated. For example, the addiction to technology and social media so prevalent in today's culture is right there in the set-up - the entire Kim family are obsessed with speaking to one another via phones and computers, and recording pretty much everything, often at the expense of having more natural face-to-face conversations. Another subject is the toxicity of the internet, the prevalence of online troll culture, and the tendency for people to say things online that they never would in person, believing that the anonymity afforded by the internet gives them the right to be unpleasant. This is communicated primarily through one scene - after watching a news report about Margot on YouTube, David begins reading the comments, which almost immediately start making jokes about him having killed her, and being ""father of the year"" (presented as a meme, obviously, because typing is such a drag).A very pertinent topic in the wake of Trump's election is the dissemination of fake news, and this is conveyed through a half-funny, half-unpleasant scene - shortly after realising Margot is missing, David speaks to Abigail (Briana McLean), at whose house the study group had taken place, who confesses that she barely knew Margot. Later on, however, when the media is swarming all over the case, she is seen on the news, tearfully lamenting how much she misses her ""best friend."" The impossibility of ever being invisible online is another topic. Yes, the film is about a person who had an entire online existence that no one knew about, but that was only because no one had looked. Once someone did, and once a few threads were pulled, everything is exposed, as the impossibility of erasing ones digital footprint becomes manifest in the story. Anyone who has spent any amount of time online will be familiar with many of these issues, and the fact that they all ring so true, without the film becoming preachy, is a testament to the quality of the film-making.Finally, and this cannot be overemphasised, the film includes a pitch-perfect, perfectly timed, perfectly delivered Justin Bieber joke that is absolutely hilarious, and has to be seen to be appreciated.",Searching

149,Jared_Andrews,"Best Yet of the ""Computer-Screen"" Movies",8,10 September 2018,"A story told entirely through a character's laptop screen - it's an increasingly popular gimmick that's now been done enough times that it can no longer be called fresh. But, thankfully, this is best execution of the style to date. Aneesh Chaganty dazzles in his directorial debut, displaying a mastery of the medium, crafting a compelling film narrative told entirely through someone's laptop activity. The movie comes out hot with a mostly nonverbal tale of love and family that's shades of 'Up' and nearly as affecting. An emotionally warping scene like that to kick things off lets us know immediately that we're in good hands. The music choices give a strong signal of this as well. I firmly believe that music choices in the opening minutes of movies are as reliable an indicator of the movie's quality as you'll find. This moving love story tells that us the family is close, or, at least they were before mom died. Now dad David (John Cho) is raising his daughter Margot (Michelle La) as well he can, but they seem a bit distant. When Margot mysteriously goes missing, he finds out just how little he knows about his daughter. He and police detective Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) scramble to find out what happened to Margot - was she kidnapped, catfished, or did she runaway? The work they put in to unravel this mystery is frantic and exhausting. They track Margot's car on traffic cams, they contact all of her Facebook friends, and they dig for anything of use they can find on her laptop. The level of detail displayed in the investigation is so thorough that it's as much an education in snooping as it is entertainment (not that parents should follow these steps to snoop on their own kids!) It's a constant thrill ride throughout, even as conventional storytelling techniques seep through the cracks at the end when the laptop screen gimmick proves too challenging. One answered question leads to five more unanswered, and a few false endings and twists will leave you breathless. In movies, there are twists and then there are TWISTS. ""Searching"" has TWISTS.

154,ctowyi,This is a movie that very much informs these times,8,17 October 2018,"I saw the trailer for Searching a couple times at the cinema. The one adjective that exploded in my mind was ""gimmicky"". Watching the story events unfold on a computer screen projected on a cinema screen definitely screams gimmicky, but I have to admit it worked and it is also an absorbing nerve-shredding exercise. The narrative device serves the story well and I can't help but feel the movie wouldn't have worked as well with a more traditional approach. The novel concept also serves to make a statement of these current times where social media and the internet rule every day and every moment of our lives.There is an air of inevitability about the inventive concept. We live in times where social media and the internet are so much a part of us - where we are, what we are doing, our likes, desires, frustrations and all our myriad of feelings are showcased like beacons and loutish statements that our lives are so vivid. We craved affirmations in the form of a ""like"". However, herein lies the great irony: for all that the social media purports to do - making the world smaller and connected, it can also make one feel lonelier as one ogles at everybody's life which somehow feels more colourful than yours.Once Cho's David Kim meticulously investigates Margot's digital footprint, he learns that he doesn't know his daughter. How well do you know your children? What is written on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and the likes, how much can you trust it? The movie does a good job of showing the duality of these social platforms.Cho is well-cast as the anxious father and his emotional range is palpable. Equally effective is Debra Messing as the no nonsense policewoman. Newcomer Michelle La is also excellent as Margot.All the more impressive is that Searching is Indian-American Aneesh Chaganty's directorial debut. The movie won the Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize and Next Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. His grasp of the thriller genre is impeccable and I am sure you will hear Hitchcock's name mentioned in the same breath. What I find most impressive is his use of the concept and how it never feels laboured all through a breathless 103 minutes. It all feels plausible and natural. Just observe the initial few minutes in which it gives texture and breath to Margot's life from birth and you are already vested in the characters on a computer screen.It is very hard to pen a review for Searching because the thrill is in the visceral experience and not knowing what comes next. This is a rollercoaster of a ride and just when you think the rollercoaster car has completed the most death-defying loop and is about to pull into the station, it does one more wild cartwheel with your insides hanging out and your adrenaline shot through the roof. This is a movie that very much informs these times.",Searching

The first 5 minutes of this film draws you in and it's 10/10 for most of film only in small doses did it drop to 9/10. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as you can get to it but gets the top score for originality . It's so immersive , you're there , you are the father , he does what you would do . People who don't use the internet may not get this film but for those who do - you're going to love this . This uses the big screen to condense your vision into the small screen - filmed in a form of first person POV - but you see both sides of the camera - you see what the character sees and and you see the character be it visually or in text form.This thriller is what cinema has been waiting for - the next step is the 4th dimension but that's an idea I've been working on so it's not relevant to this review . Like all good thrillers it's got twists and turns and although you might guess the ending as I did you are still not sure as you're constantly given plausible alternatives . What I loved about the film was the journey as the characters develop so does the operating system , software and hardware making the story very believable - it's definitely a film for the gadget loving social media using cyber generation and its use of live chat is groundbteaking - the film just feels so real - with typos and corrections , deletes all making it so absorbing .

John Cho is the father of a 16-year-old girl who disappears suddenly. His anguished ordeal and subsequent work with the investigating detective, played by Debra Messing, comprise the film's twisting journey, which will tax the viewer's threshold quite often.Although the film can be a bit much sometimes, it never dulls in its impact or loses is narrative power. You will be drawn in from start to finish, from the film's brief introduction to this family to its conclusion. A pulsating soundtrack amplifies the tension level. But fair warning, you might be somewhat exhausted at times because this film does not pull any punches in portraying the father's angst and is therefore tough on both the father and the audience's psyche. You also might learn something about how much can be found out about someone online in a relatively short period of time.I used to never pay attention to John Cho as an actor but by now his acting bona fides are concretely demonstrated and he's quite good here, bringing all the angst, fear and rage that a distraught parent will experience in a story like this.

182,RMurray847,4.0 out of 5 stars Well-executed if implausible thriller,7,8 January 2021,"The premise of the film is simple. Widower John Cho has had trouble connecting with his teen-age daughter, yet doesn't realize how out of touch with her day-to-day life he's become. And one day, she disappears suddenly, and foul play is suspected. He works hard to solve the mystery himself, and collaborates with a police detective (Debra Messing), uncovering some dark secrets in the meantime.The gimmick with this film is that the entire story is told through a computer screen. Facebook pages, you tube videos, emails and messages, old videos stored on hard drives, etc. Lots of video chatting. (The movies UNFRIENDED and UNFRIENDED: DARK WEB used the same device.) It's a low-budget let surprisingly effective and immediate story-telling device. We share with the father a sense of discovery. We learn as he learns. He doesn't know things we don't know...nor do we know what HE doesn't. It's fun, but on occasion, the credibility of this is stretched pretty thin...and when dad has to step out of his house, we still keep up with him because he is the subject of news reports that we get to watch. So yes, the device is clever but often strained.What really works well in the film is the convincing work by star John Cho. He's come a long way from his HAROLD AND KUMAR days, and gives a well-rounded portrait of a smart man, crushed by grief and now confounded by how little he really knows his daughter. (He finds out, for example, that she has stopped going to her once beloved music lessons...but has kept the money and said nothing to her dad.) His convincing work makes us look past the confining story-telling device, and pulls us into the emotion of the story. He makes SEARCHING more than just a clever story...it has a real emotional impact.There's a real mystery here, and it takes a couple of pretty cool turns. I found myself surprised a couple of times, EVEN as I then berated myself for not having ""seen it coming."" But hindsight is always 20/20...I liked being surprised.Somehow, this movie didn't garner a huge audience in the theaters, even though it is vastly superior to others of its ilk.

In this movie, YOU CAN'T TRUST ANYONE. And people are willing to misguide and mislead him. If he wasn't just a laid back dad. NO this dad is willing to do everything himself. And this film makes you really believe that he is a father looking for his daughter. And everything is SHOWN to us instead of being TOLD. The father daughter relationship felt so REAL. The dad humor was on point, and when things got serious it felt real. It was like ""Taken"", but if it happened in real life. Google search the hell out of your daughter's life to find her.

So wait a second...if none of these things mattered, then who was the bad guy? Oh, it was some kid who we didn't even see the entire movie. A character who was mentioned, but who wasn't in the film. Great writing. Not.
So the bad kid's mom is a cop who helped him cover up the crime (of pushing a girl down a hill...not exactly Murder One) . And then at the end, she simply confesses?

Her friends don't know where she went, she hasn't answered his calls; so he decides to use her laptop and privacy in order to find her with the help of Detective Vick.I was pretty intrigued by the premise and the film's style. It uses the same style as the Unfriended movies, with the entire movie being told through a computer screen. And while those movies were more horror based, this one instead is a thriller that went above and beyond my expectations.This is an intense, engaging and even thought-provoking film. This is easily the best use of the computer-only style in a theatrical movie, although it's still a new style. Starting at minute one, it's used to tell a heartbreaking story between the daughter and her mother through shared images and videos. There are also scenes where we see text being typed out through texting and Facebook chat that convey feelings, that get deleted for various reasons. Moments like those got me to think about how the characters behind the screen were thinking. I love the little details like those that signify show, don't tell, especially since we don't always see John Cho's face.Aside from the computer-only perspective, the story had me hooked. Once we gain access to the daughter's Facebook account, we begin to learn more about her and the things she has done after the tragedy that struck at the beginning. From the information that we get, the story becomes intense and very thought-provoking. It gets to the point where you have no idea what's gonna happen next. And by the last 15 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat.I gotta say, I was blown away by how amazing this movie is. It uses the computer-only perspective well using aspects of shot, don't tell and has a story that is just gripping from start to finish.

After that, he proved his mettle once again in the Exorcist by acting both as a loving orphanage caretaker and a grief-stricken man possessed by a demon. So, when I heard about Searching, I was more than excited.Searching definitely beats the expectations. Its an engrossing, edge of the seat thriller which goes through unexpected twists and turns throughout its runtime. What works the most is the emotional angle placed on the side. The troubled father-daughter relationship is subtly put in front of the audience, making it more engaging. While watching it, I found myself looking for clues, or any sign of her, as I wanted her to find his daughter. The film has this much tension to grip your attention. The presence of Cho adds to the charm of it. The supporting casts, especially Debra Messing, did justice with what little time they were on screen, as it was a full-on John Cho's show. Along with all this, the background music from start to finish perfectly reflects the mood of every scene. The effectiveness of skilful direction is clearly visible. I'm sure, Chaganty will be getting a lot of work now that Searching is being praised everywhere.One thing, Searching is no Columbus. But it comes close. It is one tight thriller which won't allow you to check your phones or look at your friend emptying the popcorn bucket. So, if you got time this weekend, do not miss this.

208,Vivkon,A Homo pad's Look at Life Around,10,13 September 2018,"The Homo sapien as a biological species has a strong ability to discover and accumulate knowledge (writing books, creating songs, study). His counterpart is the Homo pad who has the ability to distribute and retrieve information. Homo pads look at life through the interface of modern software devices (ipads and iphones, chats, social media, streaming and broadcasting video system). In this movie, ""Searching"", the concept of how one looks at reality through the computerized world is examined. It is obviously a great achievement in directing (Aneesh Chaganty) and photography (Juan Sebastian Baron& Will Merrick).The way of storytelling in this movie features surfing from screen to screen, browser to browser, window to window, tab to tab. This is a fresh and new trend for the big movie (see Profile, 2018; Hardcore Henry, 2015; Black Mirror, 2011-,). This technique allows us to look at situations through the eyes of characters, to be online with characters, to be a part of the character's user activity. This screening modestly simulates immersive theater with its absence of any barriers between actors and audience. ""Searching"" lets movie viewers join that quest to discover the mystery of the disappearing daughter of David Kim (John Cho). For the touch-screen generation, whose lives interact with smartphones and touchpads, this movie provides an easy way of perceiving and reading the procedural narrative for rescuing a lost person. Additionally, this movie presents some life hack about how to act in complicated situations. For example, jus do your own research anytime: classify and eliminate information on irrelevant issues; try to involve more people for troubleshooting; trust people and information, but don't forget about reviewing and double-checking. Although the tech features of the movie are its most original aspect of the picture, viewers can discover one strong social message. It is about the parents responsibility. The movie raises the issues of the role of parents in the maze of their children's social media and IT. There are two clear patterns of parenthood: David with daughter Margot, and Rosemary (Debra Messing) with her son. They have absolutely different styles of parenthood and it is difficult to say which is the best example of parenthood. David is a typical perfectionist with an engineering education, who has a well organized PC desktop and files in folders. Rosemary is a detective, who swings from one project to another, usually with an untidy hairstyle. If their children didn't have problems, the parents wouldn't engage in discovering the children's social network. Technology has been extremely helpful and useful for David's and Rosemary's families in their search for David's daughter (Michelle La). As can be seen, the delivery of the Searching story via Homo pads look, provides the movie making process with this new concept. It pulls viewer into the heart of the movie. Emotionally it enhances feelings and totally engages in the movie narrative. This form of observing the story enhances the emotional reaction of the viewer. Probably, without touch-screen special effects the storytelling of the movie would be boring. Regardless this, tech fans will applaud for IT framework, and regular moviegoers also will enjoy this story.",Searching

Reporting her missing and initiating a widespread search with the assistance of Detective Rosemary Vick (Messing), David tirelessly searches for his daughter with the hopes of bringing her home safe. Chaganty's film adopts an uncommon storytelling device in that the entire film takes place within various different screens, with Facebook messenger, Facetime, and news reports being some of more prominent platforms through which the story is presented. Though this cinematic storytelling tactic has been seen once before in tech-horror flick Unfriended (2014), it proves to be a thrilling method for Searching, resulting in an edge of your seat film that will have you hooked from the start. For those concerned that its format will be a turn off, don't be. Before you know it, you'll forget about the format entirely due to the strengths of the storytelling. Chaganty and Ohanian's screenplay is sharply written and fiercely intense as the drama escalates, and John Cho is terrific as David, who's fragile desperation aches terribly once the investigation gets heated. Searching is a film reminiscent of every parent's worst nightmare. Its central question asks: do you really know your child?

The idea to solely use computer perspective/facetime for an entire movie was genius and utilized extremely well. The pacing and tone throughout the film really showed how gifted Chaganty is at telling an amazing story. I really felt for the characters and the movie never let up, there was always a new clue or twist that kept me immersed in the film. It's very difficult to find a good mystery let alone one that uses modern technology as the main focal point. It would be impossible to be disappointed with this film.

But here we are with Searching.The technology in this film isn't simply there as a gimmick. Of course, it is a gimmick, but it is used fully, so it's not merely a gimmick, and is actually quite interesting and clever at most points. The subtleties are practically nailed, as mouse movements seem natural, and hesitations come as natural moments of drama, and as a result the way the story is presented allows it to be interactive, and makes it hard not to sympathize with the father in this story as he tries to uncover the mystery of his missing daughter.The mystery is actually rather surprising, which is uncommon for me with these types of movies as I often guess the ending pretty close to the start as I did with Saw V, Looper, and Identity. The brilliance is that it could be one of several things, and the film goes through each in a believable order and doesn't feel like it misses any ground and the reveal feels natural, believable, and doesn't feel contrived.Though it's a rather minimalist film, there's never a dull moment. Every moment feels genuine and important even though most of the film is one guy interacting with phones and laptops. I vastly prefer a film like this which opts to be psychological rather than try to wow you with visual effects or crazy twists or wacky, obnoxious characters.Aneesh Chaganty did a great job with this film and I look forward to see what he has in store in the future. I do hope he goes in a new route with his next film though, as I think this film's gone about all the good their is to do with the concept.",Searching

This movie, which is about a dad finding her missing daughter using the internet, is the best movie I've seen this year. A movie strictly screen recorded from laptops will soon drive the medium of filmmaking to newer, exciting heights. What could've easily sounded obnoxious and trite somehow evokes more drama, tension, airtight plot progression, and a strong grasp of cinematic language. There are many movies that surpassed my expectations, but not since this years YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE has a film truly transcended me.This is one of those ""dad-knows-best"" movies that secretly critiques and twists that formula to interesting heights. Sure we see the main character dive in to multiple websites and somehow piece together who the killer is faster than the police, but the films genius is in the context. We all became so engrained into technology that a simple dive to your daughters Instagram account makes us detectives of our own. So watching this man explore comments and track phone numbers becomes instantly more relatable yet seemingly implausible.Speaking of implausible still at awe of how perfectly written this is. Strip away all the gimmick and you have a really smart, sturdy thriller that expertly blends interesting themes into the genre mold. But what takes this the extra mile comes from how Director Aneesh Chaganty's talented use of screen record. Every type and clench of the Delete key perfectly resembles speechlessness and every pull on a webpage to reveal clues clenches with tension. A gimmick like this could only go so far by anyone, like the dudes who still make those UNFRIENDED movies, but this guy really holds his own with it.It's also, by all stretches of the word, a deeply uncynical film. Anyone could easily commentate on how much we're fixated on our laptops, yet this film reminds us the cherished memories we keep with it. Anyone could easily revolve around the incompetencies of parenthood admist a tragedy, yet it still finds sympathy and pathos instead. Anyone could easily blame the callous behaviors of teenagers on the internet, and yet the film never dwells or even highlights that to be the main issue. It properly sets up the vivid world we live in today, yet all it's used for is to tell a thought-provoking yet sympathetic story.SEARCHING is just pure master stroke within every frame. John Cho, Michelle La, Sarah Sohn, Debra Messing, and Joseph Lee all deserve Hollywood stardom after this considering the powerhouse talent they bring; the filmmaking, yes filmmaking, hits every right beat; the lingering questions emotional ballast, like the family photos you keep in your folder, stays with you forever; there's just too much to recommend in this.

241,Kristamw,Stellar,10,3 September 2018,"A thriller mystery that keeps your heartbeat up and down with multiple red herrings and a tiny dash of relieving humor to get you through the suspense. What works so well here are a number of things. Searching does not follow the typical formulaic outline of a mystery thriller. It uses a laptop to tell its story. It intertwines many puzzle pieces. And it contains a plot that hinges on a loving father who is convinced that his daughter would not just run away, even though clues, like her not taking piano lessons for the past six months and using that cash her dad gave her for them to pay for something mysterious, don't resonate with the daughter he knows.
Character Development: Excellently executed. The dad, David Kim (John Cho) plays the endearing father who is admiringly patient as he sifts through his daughter's laptop, tracing her digital history to uncover answers. But as the 37th hour of the detective's case arrives, Mr. Kim's sense of urgency turns up a notch. Desperation and a deep desire to find his daughter fuel his own investigation amid doubts of who his daughter was and how well he actually knew her mixed with a barrage of strangers in his daughter's life who may or may not be involved with her disappearance.
Pacing/Writing Quality: The director's (Aneesh Chaganty ) decision to film the entire movie through a laptop may seem unwise, yet it works because it sets exactly the right pace. Being ""on"" tends to exhibit things like urgency, distraction, and heightened awareness, and all of those things come alongside to effectively steer Mr. Kim's inspection and intensify the corners we keep turning with him.
Content (language, sex, & violence): The cleanest thriller. One use of the F-bomb, but this is shown in an unsent text message and its use is non-offensive. There is no nudity, no sex, nothing graphic shown. The only violence depicted appears in two scenes: in a tussle between the father and another character and in a scene where a character swings at the father, though this is shown from a distance and is very brief. The only blood shown is the dried blood on the father's chin, after he is hit.

You really gotta' keep up and pay attention just as if you were the desperate parent conducting the same search. It puts you in the same mindset of the father which has a very different and unique gripping effect over other movies of this genre.

I think I loved it primarily because of the fact that it was about family and issues we all could relate to and I felt the father's pain and determination and persistence to get to the bottom of his daughter's disappearance.I'm not Asian but I especially love the fact that the main familial characters were Asian. I get tired of seeing films that are comprised mostly of Black, White or Hispanic characters. America is a melting pot and just like Black and Hispanic children need to see movies characters that look like them and go through problems they can relate to, so do Asian American children.

279,neobateman,How much do we really know others? Even if they are our own flesh and blood?,8,15 September 2018,"These are questions raised in Aneesh Chaganty's directorial debut, Searching. A film I walked in not knowing what to expect and that I left pleasantly surprised. Star Trek's John Cho plays David Kim. An everyday citizen and father who attempts to reconcile with his daughter after a family tragedy. On one seemingly normal day, his daughter Margot disappears. David is forced to use the resources on his computer to figure out what happened to his daughter. This film is yet another example of the idea of setting an entire film on a computer screen. I initially liked the concept but the films that used it never impressed me because they never went past the idea of 'cyberbullying is bad' or 'the internet is evil'. This is what I appreciated about Searching, the film is far more mature and allows the audience to see into the minds of the characters. They aren't purposely inventing fake personas to protect themselves from the evil forces of the internet. No they are defined by what they post on the internet. I found that the small details that are thrown on screen really effective in exploring the characters. Whether it was a small ad or a comment on a photo. John Cho should be a movie star at this point and I hope that this film allows him to become one. He has generally been sidelined to supporting roles and here is allowed to really shine as a frustrated and panicked father trying to cope with this situation. He is funny and relatable turning into worried, turning into resourceful and full on panic. His performance is magnificent and should be commended because he is in fact limited by what he can do on screen because of the aforementioned setting. I thought that the film had an excellent structure, very lighthearted and relatable at first and turning more dark and twisted as the story progresses. However what I think amplifies Searching to what in my opinion is one of the best films of the year is that it actually challenges our own perception of society. Without trying to spoil too much, David attempts to find his daughter by contacting people who appear to have relations with her. However when talks to them he somewhat hits a brick wall, no one can say much, but as the case becomes a trend (not a spoiler!), the reactions by them change. This raises the question, why? Are they actually exploiting a tragedy for attention? This seems very familiar if one follows things like youtube drama. I found that the implementing of these themes made the film a lot more effective and elevated it from just being a very fun thriller. At the end of the day, Searching truly surprised me. Not only was it an engaging thriller with a great leading performance by John Cho but what made it even better for me was the social implications this film showed and finding a solid balance of not being too preachy. If I had to point out a flaw it would be that there were many twists and turns in this film. There were some that I felt were only in there to trick the audience, of course most thrillers do this but the ones that do it best feel organic and real. Searching fails at this especially one really seemingly disturbing twist that doesn't really go anywhere and is simply there to trick audiences. Other than that I highly recommend Searching, in my opinion one of the biggest surprises this year.",Searching

281,pokedom,Actually a masterpiece,9,16 September 2018,"Just got back from the theater and I'm in a rush. I want to just blunt this review full of positives upon positives in a frantic dash to tell everyone to go watch this masterpiece ASAP, but I also want to just take a little bit of time to think it over and then come back tomorrow with an even better description of why you should see this masterpiece ASAP. This is one of the best movies I've seen in some time, and that's not an understatement.I guess there's a nitpick. The mouse on screen goes way too slow. I know this because every mouse I've ever seen click on things or used myself to click on things is fast, jagged movements, sometimes even imprecise to the point of clicking on something accidentally. The one on screen was like a commercial telling us how to use the internet, it's going so slow as if to show the universe ""and this is where you click to find your daughter"". When it hesitates you know it's doing so on purpose but when it's not it still feels like the person behind the screen is hesitating to click and move it around.... I think that's it. It should say a lot that the only thing I could find wrong with it was one really dumb nitpick.The style, oh my god the style. Everything is from the viewpoint of the monitor on a computer. I know what you're thinking ""I've seen my Unfriendeds I know where this is going, they're gonna mess this up aren't they?"" Never once is a fake website used. No part of this movie is faked saved for the series of events broadcasted on a site such as CBS or CNN or what have you. The only time we see actors are in photos, Facetimes, and the news broadcasts. And despite this it's never dull. Because of the story, which I'll get into don't worry, every action, every click, has a weight to it. It's so great.The characters all act like humans in a terrible situation. Special shoutouts to John Cho, who is the Daniel Day Lewis of this movie. He give a grounded and real and powerful performance. He's also extremely tech savvy. He knows his way around websites and files, he's not just some bumbling idiot on a laptop. He's not perfect, how can you be on a place as big as the information super highway, but he does more than enough to qualify as very tech smart.The story itself is very simple and very very effective. Not once did it take a break to get too crazy, and the only time it took a moment to show off a website was when our lead was learning how to use the livestreaming site, which still made sense seeing as how he didn't know it even existed before. You can tell how important everything is, how serious the situation is, how it sets itself up for the frantic final act.Speaking of the final act, I have to mention that this is a twist movie. I must say that the twist does paint the movie in a different light, but after it happens everything starts piecing itself together perfectly. It's a great twist that makes me want to see it again!I highly, highly, highly recommend this movie. I've gushed enough, it's on you now to go see this one.",Searching

In addition to being a lackluster father, the man was kind of dumb.

302,pinemaples,What you're searching for.,10,12 September 2018,"When I first saw the trailer for Searching, I thought it looked good, but I didn't expect just how good it would turn out to be. The new mystery thriller stars John Cho as David Kim, a father scrambling for any information he can find on his computer after Margot, his daughter, goes missing.The presentation is a little unorthodox in that it mimics a ""found footage"" style, which is mostly seen only in horror movies. What sets Searching apart from movies like Unfriended is the way the camera pans around the screen, smoothly guiding the audience's attention towards pertinent details, while smartly hiding extra particulars lurking in the background until they begin to become relevant. In a way, this echoes more traditional mystery styles, where a detective might unknowingly pass a stranger on the street in one scene, until turning around and recognizing them as important to the case. Incredibly, this approach never wore out its welcome for me over the 102-minute runtime, as I quickly forgot it was anything out of the ordinary.Part of this is due to the incredible world-building and how fleshed out and well-rounded the characters are. Over the course of the movie, you get to know each of the primary characters, as well as many secondary and more minor ones. Different traits organically pop up over natural interaction and the audience gradually learns how none of the characters are exactly what they appear to be on the surface. It also helps that this is some of the best acting I've seen in a movie, especially from vehicle lead John Cho, known for other roles such as Harold from Harold and Kumar, or Sulu from the newer Star Trek movies. Debra Messing and Joseph Lee both pull their weight too as the detective leading the investigation and the brother, both of whom David grows to rely on as the story proceeds. Michelle La easily stands out among the rest as David's vulnerable yet increasingly enigmatic daughter Margot. There are no cliches, no stereotypes, and no cardboard-cutouts. These people feel like people.When the mystery comes to a head and reaches its climax, the reveals are never out of left field and each point makes sense as you think back to how all the events connected over the course of the film. It almost begs a second viewing so you can look back on the way all the events unfolded, re-examine each of the clues that were scattered along the trail, and shake your head at the notion that you couldn't see the truth from the beginning.Yet, through all of the mystery, the movie never loses its heart. You can't help but feel you're right there with David the entire time, being outraged at the unjustness of each person standing in his way, crying every time he is defeated and hits a dead-end, and reveling in each connection you and David make together. You feel that David's failures are your failures, his successes are your successes, and his family is your family. The opening sequence in particular, reminding me strongly of the Pixar movie Up, left me heartbroken. The writers simply excelled at putting the viewer in the situation. I was right there with David, every step of the way.I cannot recommend this movie enough.

305,GoldenBlunderbuss,A interesting way to tell an engrossing story,8,26 July 2018,"A father hunts social media and the internet for clues to his daughter's disappearance, but has to ask what if she wasn't abducted? What if she simply ran away?We live in a world where our every action, thought and impulse can be broadcast to the world if we chose (or even if we don't). To therefore see a film where that plays into the hands of people on both sides of the criminal spectrum forces the audience to decide as to which side the fence they sit with regard to personal data protection, as well as tackling the effects of catfishing and leading multiple 'fake' lives online.The story circles around the efforts of a recent widower whose daughter isn't returning his calls and appears to have gone missing in an abduction case; however, her social media and banking accounts leads the police to suspect that maybe she ran away. Not content with the version of events, the desperate father follows his own line of enquiry to attempt to uncover what really happened to her.Since we're looking through the online world for the majority of the time, the film has a lot to say on the vindictive nature of a mass online audience with no moral boundaries or sense of individual responsibility. There are the 'Best Dad' memes, the needlessly speculative neighbours who just want their 15 minutes of fame on NBC, the trending 'dad did it' hashtag, the endless ""thoughts and prayers"", and the flip-flopping of people, through crocodile tears, who now claim to have been best friends his daughter for the sake of 'views' and 'likes'. The way the film is delivered exclusively via laptop screens - from the revelation of a family tragedy via calendar invites to characters' inner thoughts being typed in a text but then deleted - is one of its top strengths and gives it the draw that keeps the audience 100% engaged up to until the final (incredibly satisfying if exposition-heavy) whodunit reveal. It would be wrong, however, to say it was unique or pioneering; let's not forget that 2014's Unfriended did it to a lesser degree than Searching manages.There will be some people who will hate the way it's presented as being on a PC monitor, who won't like the ending twists, who will despise the use of social media as a plot device. I think they're wrong; it's deeply refreshing to see something new, vibrant and different done so well for a change.Best Quote: ""It is the police's job - not yours - to act on flakes of evidence.""",Searching

Instead, this film treats it as a platform to tell a compelling mystery story with an excellent performance by John Cho and a quite honestly revolutionary sense of direction at its center.""Searching"" concerns itself primarily with the character of David Kim, played by John Cho (Of 'Harold & Kumar' fame), who's daughter goes missing suddenly and is only left with a trail of breadcrumbs that exist entirely on the internet. Whether it be social media, text logs or anything in-between, the film becomes a frantic search to find his missing daughter.The film itself is an odd hybrid of the Found Footage genre and of an actual narrative film. What I mean by this is that we still see close ups, we still hear a musical score, and still see various camera tricks incorporated into the film, but our vantage point is limited only to a screen and what may appear on it. Because of this, the direction expertly resorts to showing many forms of multi-media to paint a story that a feature film could tell. From the film's wide-spanning opening (Which is oddly reminiscent of Pixar's ""Up"" in more ways than one) to every direction it goes beyond that, the film stays in its proverbial lane and uses its media and its story platform to tell a compelling story within its mean.This execution, by first-time director Aneesh Chaganty, is done BRILLIANTLY. There is not a single moment where you do not buy what is occurring on-screen when it comes to the way these sites and media function (Aside from a few hiccups that I will get into later), and it truly shows an understanding of both the limits of this scope and of the media they used to tell this story. Crazy as it sounds, it is an incredible accomplishment seen here by Chaganty that the film remained comprehensible, well-directed, and ended up as the first film of its genre to ever incorporate social media properly.Speaking of which, it is a delight that we do not get any fake websites in this film. What I mean by this is, there is no ""sub-in"" for Youtube or Facebook or anything of that like. Facebook is Facebook, Youtube is Youtube, Tumblr is Tumblr, etc etc. It is both a treat to those who look for authenticity in this concept that not only did the crew know what they were talking about, but also to see that they trusted audience to expect realism and no substitute. Fake social media sites in film is out, and incorporating the quite real social media sites around us is IN..and I couldn't be happier.This could perhaps be enough for a downright experimental film to be considered serviceable, but what truly elevates this even further is John Cho's fantastic performance as a father at his wit's end fighting to find his daughter. Though we only get small bursts of the clear talent and commitment he has for this role, by the time the film was over even his own mouse cursor and movements depicted by his searching through the internet had its own injected 'character' to it.Despite how well the film is executed, a few flaws do hold it back from being a masterpiece by a first-time director. The climax of the film and the conclusion we reach to the mystery itself is a bit fantastical and hard-to-buy for my tastes, though it hardly ruins the entire film structurally. In addition, Michelle La as the daughter character is not especially good in the scenes she is featured in, which was perhaps why the only scenes I never felt entirely invested were the ones where she was front-and-center. Considering this is her first feature film role, that's perhaps simply inexperience coming to the fore, but it still hurts the film when her scenes are sandwich between a fantastic performance by John Cho.Along with these problems with story and performances, the minuscule details between the lines of the film's internet setting are a tad fuzzy. Namely things regarding the service YouChat and how it is presented, along with the tiniest nitpicks in presentation like the mouse cursor moving so buttery-smoothly it became hard to buy. In addition, my feelings toward the film having a background score are a tad mixed, though I grew to accept it as the film went on. Simply a matter of tastes.All of that said, ""Searching"" is a quite masterfully done thriller with an execution that is truly a marvel to behold. Never has this genre of found footage been able to crack the concept of painting a thrilling film through the scope of a computer screen until now. With the internet seemingly 'cracked' by these writers and directors, however, this film ends up a first of its kind and quite the investing ride to take at the theatre.I highly recommend you see this film and support something so indie and so unique.

Why I liked this movie can be summed up quite succinctly with four simple words: compelling story, engaging presentation. Allow me to elaborate.This movie has an incredibly well written story. It starts with a heartfelt sequence of home movies that endears you to all of our main characters in minutes, quite similar to the beginning of Up (2009). It then unfolds a mystery, layer by layer, until you are quite literally on the edge of your seat, in anticipation for the final reveal. At no point along the way does it ever really slow down or get dull. Everything that happens is meaningful and contributes to either the narrative or the tone. A big part of the story working so well has to do with the excellent performance from John Cho. The entire premise of the story hinges upon his performance as he is the emotional core of it all. Without him, this movie might not be nearly as good. In addition to having a tight, well-written screenplay, Searching also is presented in an incredibly fascinating way. Chaganty uses the restrictions of ""screen life"" to his favor by creating inventive and new ways to present information. In doing so, he truly draws the viewer into the perspective of John Cho's character as everything is essentially shown from his point of view. This heightens both the tension as we learn things at the same time he does, as well as makes his character that much more empathetic. 2018 has had a pretty stellar summer in terms of the quality of movies that we've seen, and Searching thankfully doesn't break the trend. It wouldn't surprise me if this becomes the sleeper hit of the summer. It's quite good. Do yourself a favor and go see it!",Searching
311,spotboyfilms,A Thriller full of Hope,10,31 January 2019,"This is an incredible film, the type that comes around every once in a while, like District 9.
All technical awesomeness aside, John Cho's performance is just awesome. He really pulls you in in the way he interacts with every aspect of discovery, conflict and resolution.
The beginning of the film carries the same emotional weight as the beginning of 'Up.' You are really pulled into John Cho's characters relationship with his daughter.
Then the film goes into thriller mode. Technically, this done brilliantly. You are always looking at a screen of some sort no matter what is going on. You figure out things when John firgures out things using the same clues that are in front of you.
The twists in the story are brilliant. And I for one did not see any of them coming.
Finally, the film leaves you with a message of hope, and love. It is one of the great endings in film that I haven't seen in a very long time.

You search for the daughter along with John Cho, you discover things as he discovers them, and the twists just keep on coming. The twists are well earned and upon second viewing (and the next 4 viewings, I love this movie) you realize how well established they are. Every word of dialogue is very carefully placed and chosen. To me, this movie is a classic and unique, in the same way that 'District 9' is. There's no other like it. (I know 'Unfriended' exists from the same producer, but 'Searching' is in a league of it's own). Do yourself a favor, Watch this movie if you haven't seen it.

313,chasemykleby,The mystery unfold through the devices that consume our everyday existence helps complement the movie's themes about personal connections and the dangers (and benefits) of tec,10,9 March 2019,"""Searching"" Movie Review
(10/10)Searching is told via computer and smartphone screens, a device that helps elevate the final product. The decision to have the mystery unfold through the devices that consume our everyday existence helps complement the movie's themes about personal connections and the dangers (and benefits) of technology.
Chagnaty never feels limited by working on this canvas, keeping the proceedings visually engaging throughout Searching's taut runtime and making something mundane like a web search feel very dramatic. There are some neat tricks on display (see: the ""sleep screen"" transitions to indicate it's a new day), and the technology component helps Searching feel fresh and unique, despite the on-paper setup (teenage daughter disappears) being familiar. The news article's are filled with easter eggs, and if you are really paying very close attention to the details on the screen, you will find out the abductor halfway through the film.
Searching isn't just an exercise for a showy new style. It helps greatly that Cho gives one of his finest performances as David. One does not need to be a parent to empathize with his character, with the actor brilliantly portraying the desperation of the situation. What makes Cho's turn stand out even more is that he has an opportunity to explore various sides of David, taking part in some actions that are morally questionable (but justifiable from his point of view), forcing the audience to contemplate what they would do if they were going through the same thing. Cho has to do much of the heavy lifting and carries Searching on his shoulders, proving he's a more-than-capable leading man.
The supporting cast is great, even if all the focus is meant to be on David. Messing is a strong authoritarian presence as Vick, serving as a nice foil for the increasingly concerned and despondent David. The two stars play off each other nicely, despite most of their interactions taking place through FaceTime video chats. Joseph Lee is also good as Peter, David's stoner brother, who has more layers than one might initially think. As for La's Margot, she is a little more than just a human MacGuffin, as there are important moments of character shading that clue the audience into the kind of person Margot is.
In the end, Searching is a most pleasant surprise, serving up a gripping narrative and an outside-the-box concept that works in spades. Chagnaty announces himself as a director to watch, and it'll be interesting to see where his filmmaking career goes from here. Don't be surprised if you here this movie's name come up around Oscar Season.
(P.S. I can not stress this enough, but PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEWS HEADLINES, for you will discover the secret movie inside the movie!)",Searching
314,rubya,"Not bad, not great",6,6 June 2019,"The premise of the film is good: dad uses the digital footprint of his teenage daughter to try and find her when she goes missing.
The execution is ok although the use of computer screen gets a little tiring after a while, and I can't imagine any police investigator using Facetime extensively rather than phone calls, especially from home.
The acting for me is not great. Debra Messing is basically Grace Adler (from Will & Grace) trying to be a cop. John Cho is overacting yet seems to lack real emotions, being either overly calm or overly aggressive, usually not really in keeping with how a real human I imagine would be in these situations. This makes his character a little annoying and difficult to care for.
There are some interesting twists and a sad reference to today's social media fame pursuit and sympathy seeking when people Margot (the teenage daughter) barely knew claim to be her best friend or post ""hopes and prayers"" on social media for attention as it happens in real life.While it's not a bad film, there are some aspects that are distracting, mostly the lack of professionalism from the police as a whole.
An investigator involving a parent in extensively searching for clues as to his daughter's whereabouts without anyone putting a stop to that nonsense. Yes they would ask for information, but they wouldn't make the dad an unofficial part of the police staff. The daughter's computer would have been taken from the start for a professional to look into.
And at the end it looks like one investigator was able to manipulate a whole police force, without any supervision, nobody questioning who and when had searched the area she simply said had been cleared; nobody looking into the alleged murderer and finding the simple link between him and the investigator which may raise suspicions; and worst of all: a guy says he killed the girl, there's no body yet and the police and media are fine declaring she's 100% dead, for sure.All in all, it's a decent film but felt more like a TV, Sunday afternoon thriller than made for the cinema.",Searching

John Cho flexes new muscle as a parent, an involved parent and widower to a teenage girl who has closed off a part of herself following the death of her mother. But we don't get to explore that initially. It is just one of the layers that is cleverly exposed as this thriller meticulously unravels to it's conclusion. It doesn't dumb down for a minute and if you don't understand search engine parameters, you'll learn a few things so the film gets a point or two for teaching you something and the film doesn't make you feel like an idiot if you don't know. There are other layers going on in this film that's ventured forth, social media constructs, teenage angst, isolationism, loneliness, to name a few and it touches on these things without taking away from the plot.

The movie really shows the stress of a father trying to find his daughter and the ups and downs he goes through. Searching also shows the determination and strength of David Kim ( Father of Margot Kim ), his daughter who goes missing.Searching is about a young teen girl called Margot who suddenly goes missing on a normal day. Her father David Kim figures that something bad has happened and starts to think he should call the police as it's becoming worrisome as she hasn't been home and hasn't responded to her fathers text messages or FaceTime calls. When a detective gets involved in the case everything starts off well and parts of evidence had been found, but as the movie goes on secrets are uncovered and may ruin everything.If you are thinking about watching Searching i would definitely recommend as it's a great thriller movie and an enjoyable watch.

For starters, it's very much a modern film and very accurately, almost too accurately, depicts the average online social life of modern teenagers and young adults as well as the darker side of that aforementioned online social life. In this film, David Kim (John Cho), discovers his daughter Margot (Michelle La) failed to return home one night after going out for a study group. Initially he doesn't think much of it, assuming she got home extra late and then had already left for school the morning after she disappears.However, as time goes on things don't seem to add up and it quickly becomes clear that something happened to Margot, and it's up to her father, David to find out what. However, that turns out much easier said than done, because as he learns more about who his daughter truly was when he wasn't around everything starts to make less and less sense, until he's forced to admit that he never TRULY, knew his daughter, and that perhaps is the scariest thing about this film, and I would imagine for any loving parent to have to admit to themselves.Searching is a truly tense, riveting, and emotional thrill ride which I would recommend for anyone to watch who enjoys excellently crafted thrillers with an emotional undertone of family drama which asks both the viewers watching and the characters in the film the question of how well we really know our friends and family members, because sometimes finding out the answers might be too hard to handle, especially if it's done the hard way.Also have to give director Aneesh Chaganty, a positive shout out for crafting such a clever, remarkable film, especially for a first time directorial debut just out of college!

365,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,Innovative and groundbreaking for being GOOD at what it does,9,28 June 2018,"The word ""gimmick"" can be thrown around to describe a major element of a film that changes up the ordinary tropes we'd expect from a rather straightforward flick. There is 3D, timeline splicing, animation, found footage, you name it. Some films almost even fall into these places as a genre. When they do, you get the inkling that the people responsible for thinking up the movie likely have these elements in mind at the forefront with the story as an afterthought. Only when that occurs do I call those elements gimmicky. And it's not that a gimmick is a bad thing, but if that is what you rely on to make your story compelling, it will often become a crutch for poor storytelling or one-and-done enjoyment. Sometimes it is done right, in which case the gimmick works... but most of the time it has that negative connotation for good reason.However, there is another breed of films where you can get that feeling that a story was thought up, and ultimately it was decided that the best way to tell that story was by use of something like 3D, etc. When that happens, it is no longer a gimmick nor does it fall into that genre, so to speak. It is just the best way to tell that story, even though the story could work very well without it. I am no longer attracted to the film because of the device being used, but rather I can almost ignore that it's happening because I am so engraved in the story being told.Within the found footage narrative realm has come screencasting, where we see the world through somebody's computer or phone screen. The first and only film of this variety I have seen was Unfriended, which takes place on one user's laptop screen as she does a group webcam chat. This played off as a gimmick because it was the only way to tell the story. Searching is now the second screencasting film I have seen. It has a bit of a hybrid feel though because there are jumps to other footage needed to tell the story (perhaps from the news or something) and there is also a score that the characters otherwise wouldn't hear. Gimmick is also the last term I would use to describe what it does. Of course, this is plainly because the story is what drives the film and could be done without this style, but also because this style is doing more than tell a story: it is telling of our generation's attachments to/reliance on technology, the internet and most of all social media. The right audience will connect with this very well because they will feel very comfortable and familiar. This is where the film gets to breathe and even provide what one could call comedic relief (in just how real it all is to our technological experiences).Director and co-writer Aneesh Chaganty came up with something extraordinary, and very smartly crafted this film into something where the main character's (played by John Cho) computer and phone are not devices (no pun intended), but they are now characters. There is an inaudible dialogue between him and screen, and the audience fills the gaps of what each of them are saying to each other. I say the story could be told without the screencasting in play, but the audience would need another way of being exposed information through needless dialogue, either to oneself or other characters. That, or we would still be looking at computer screens for a very long time, or time would have to be served filling scenes in other ways, so restructuring the screenplay would be required (which is possible, but I think Chaganty found the best way to tell his story).I am still on a high with this film, to the point where I temporarily feel comfortable saying this is my favorite film of the year so far. The trailer that I just watched on this film after the fact would lend you to believe that it is a suspense/thriller, and even though it is suspenseful and thrilling I would not identify it as that. I would call it more of a drama/mystery. I think the first ten minutes of the film easily define what the entirety of the film will play out to be with regards to what emotions it will tap into you, and the opener of this film is one of my favorites in a long time. Thinking back on it, it's probably what really seals what I really think about Searching as a whole, and puts your mind at ease for the screencasting style that Chaganty tells the story with.This film is about a father whose high school daughter turns up missing, and he cooperates with the police in doing his own personal detective work through means of his electronic devices to help aid their investigation. Thinking back at some of the missing persons films I have seen in my days (Gone Girl, Prisoners, Taken, Man on Fire, Gone Baby Gone, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Flightplan, Ransom), these stories have ranged from: straightforward to conspiracy-laden, kidnappings to runaways, found alive to found deceased to never found at all... and Searching gives you reason to believe that any of these possibilities could be true, all within staying very real. I think that's what makes this movie work most, that by the end of the day you convince yourself that you felt you saw something extremely grounded and strangely relatable. I mentioned the technology/internet/social media aspects, but the characters also relate well, and because it takes place in the Bay Area it also gives more bonus points for someone like me because I have an extra connection with the locations that are mentioned or utilized. It's best that you try and not decide for yourself what kind of film or outcome you hope to see going into it, and instead commend the shrewd genius in weaving the pieces together in a very levelheaded manner.Absolutely none of this works without the sturdy acting by John Cho. You clearly see the image of a wrecked and broken father attempting to find his daughter. He has a compelling way of making us feel his his hurt and desperation. Chaganty once again used the screencasting element well here in having his character's on-screen actions say so much as well, from his mouse gestures to the things he starts to type but deletes before sending to other people, etc. The audience will not have to work too hard with these facets because of competent directing and brilliant acting. What I suggest you do work really hard at while watching, however, is what I would call the Easter eggs this film has. When a screen pops up with a bunch of e-mails, news articles, or chat conversations, you want to pick up everything that you can because you won't be able to pause and rewind in theater. But furthermore and most importantly, every revelation of this film can be grasped if you work and look hard enough at everything that Cho's character works and looks at. This is a good thing, and what makes it even better is this film is never predictable (mostly because you know as much as the protag does, because you are literally seeing the film through his eyes). You get to stay on the edge of your seat through this process, even if nothing is really going on, because you feel like you get to take everything in at the same time that he does. There is a lot to process here, and again it is all in such a very real way.This one is such a good time at the theater, and I think the only people who will be disappointed in this flick is if they: find the screencasting to be too much of a gimmick for their taste, feel misled by the trailer's overly suspenseful tone, or they already have one or two predetermined outcomes in mind that they want to happen and it doesn't suit their liking. Comparatively, my biggest gripes in this film stem from things like characters typing messages lightning-fast and perfectly (and people responding faster than they would even be able to read the message sent to them), plus off-screen voice acting was very wooden. That's pretty much it. As it stands tonight though, it is my favorite film I have seen this year. I don't want to call it groundbreaking what Chaganty did as far as influence goes (I don't expect many of these films to suddenly churn out as a result), but as far as accomplishing intent in a unique manner I think he did what no one else has before, and it works far too well for the story he told.For those who are curious, this film is not yet rated but I can easily say the MPAA will give this a PG-13.",Searching

The all-done-through-the-internet framework actually slows the film's action down because it's like everything is being relayed to you third hand, like a bad anecdote from a friend of a friend told in a pub. Also, the actual underlying story is so banal and prosaic it make the film feel even flatter and more pointless when you get to the big denouement. It's also full of tokenism and childish red herrings, like hints of drug use/dealing and online predators; it's Dangers of the Web for beginners.Finally, it seems to be cursed with bad acting. As these actors are perfectly serviceable in anything else I've seen them in, I can only assume the overwrought melodramatic acting was asked of them. Either that or it's something to do with the format because the actors weren't getting either enough interaction with others or it was too fractured into random scenes so they weren't getting continuity. Or maybe he's just a bad director.I hate to make the comparison, but it has the same amateur feel as The Blair Witch, and I fear it is suffering from the same 'It's innovative so it's fabulous' BS that plagued its reviews. Innovation is only innovation if it improves things. This ultimate orgy of product placement improves nothing. I can only assume it was its potential for advertising revenue and selling it to the 'yoof' (after all they live their lives this way) that got it made.

I didn't know my daughter."" - David Kim (John Cho) to Det. Sgt. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing)""As a parent myself, I can only imagine what you're feeling."" - Det. Sgt. Rosemary Vick (Debra Messing) to David Kim (John Cho)Potential spoilers belowTowards the end of the opening montage in Searching, Margot Kim (Michelle La) logs onto her Facebook account and clicks on the post box. No words are typed. The text cursor blinks, blinks, blinks. Adjacent, the words ""What's on your mind?"" Finally, Margot scrolls down her feed to a photo of her mother Pamela (Sara Sohn), clicks, holds, and drags the image off the web browser to a prepared funeral program document.It was at this early moment in Searching that I knew, in terms of screen POV as a cinematic tool, that it has already surpassed both 2014's horror film Unfriended and its sequel Unfriended: Dark Web from a few months ago. As a matter of fact, it would not surprise me if this filmmaking novelty will never see a better outing than this thriller that, for the first time in Hollywood history, stars an Asian-American actor.
It has been two years since David Kim (John Cho) lost his wife Pamela (Sara Sohn) to lymphoma. David feels confident that he and his 16-year-old daughter Margot (Michelle La) have moved on from grieving as Margot studies for finals and anticipates summer vacation and college applications. All of sudden, Margot goes missing. David goes to the authorities, who open an investigation and assign Det. Sgt. Rosemary Vick (a dedicated Debra Messing) to the case. As the hours and days pass, David's brother Peter (Joseph Lee) suggests that David start examining his daughter's laptop. This takes David through the gamut of modern communication tools, both everyday and cryptic, where perhaps the tiniest detail within text, images, or video could bring his daughter back.When Unfriended pioneered the screen POV technique four years ago, many criticized the horror flick beyond just succumbing to obnoxious modern horror clichés such as irredeemable characters. The new criticism focused on how Unfriended gave audiences a stale movie experience riddled with numerous computer inaccuracies and leaps of logic. The improved setup for the sequel Unfriended: Dark Web from a few months ago did little to make the screen POV gimmick more involving.Searching, by tackling a more traditional thriller plot, reveals that the prior two horror movies unwisely constrained themselves to a real-time progression. Writer-director Aneesh Chaganty, in collaboration with fellow writer Sev Ohanian and d.p. Juan Sebastian Baron, set out to render the story's screens less as a creative box and more as a different type of camera. Sure, certain revelations can come off as convenient and some text responses from off-screen characters come much sooner than most human hands can type. Nevertheless, the aforementioned craftsmen, along with editors Nick Johnson and Will Merrick and score composer Torin Borrowdale, generate a compelling and even methodical clarity to the proceedings. One way they do so is through screen zooms akin to customary camera pushes and cuts, giving more attention to the editing instead of just sitting back in a disaffected fashion like with the Unfriended movies. The filmmakers behind Searching transform loading signs, typing notifications, the movement of the pointing cursor, and the mere blinking of the text cursor in such ways that one can easily substitute the current frames with non-computer/phone screen close-ups of an anxious David Kim. They even generated tension from an overnight screensaver scene!Searching's biggest blessing comes in the performances of its cast. John Cho has come a long way from his days in the Harold & Kumar stoner comedies (for mature viewers only). He impressed me in last year's quiet and soothing arthouse drama Columbus and now he carries Searching with vigorous conviction. Michelle La, despite not appearing for much of the thriller's present-day bulk, gives an under-appreciated turn as the missing Margot Kim. Seen in flashback when her father stumbles onto her YouCast channel, Margot's suppressed despondence after the death of her mother and at her subsequent lack of a social life and distance from her father reminded me of Mark Rylance in Ready Player One from several months back. Finally (and without saying much), Debra Messing's turn as Det. Sgt. Rosemary Vick will likely serve as the predominant reason for revisiting Searching in the years to come.In light of how the cinematic horror and thriller genres often use novel ways to make their entries stand out, many have compared screen POV to the found footage device popularized in 1999's The Blair Witch Project and 2007's Paranormal Activity. As essential and iconic as those two films are, instead I hold Searching in the same high regard as the 2007 Spanish found footage horror film REC. With regards to their respective narrative gimmicks, I honestly believe that both Searching and REC will end up as the best cinematic experiences - or at least, the least problematic cinematic experiences - their gimmicks will ever produce.Neither screen POV nor found footage are destined to produce all-time cinematic masterpieces. Yet even the worst novelties deserve one or two chances to prove that they can be worthwhile. For screen POV, Searching is one chance taken that deserves all of its success.(Parental Note: Searching has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA ""for thematic content, some drug and sexual references, and for language"". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""infrequent strong language, moderate violence,"" and ""drug references"", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""mature themes, including suspicions of incest, images of and references to drug use, a mild oath, at least one rough and a few crude terms, and a single crass expression."")R.N.B.",Searching

Although the film is made on a shoe string budget, with not that noticeable of a cast, 90% of the run time playing on a computer screen, it conveys more heart, character, and emotion, than 99% of other movies.
The acting is very good, dialogue, music and tone is fantastic and for the first time in movie history, the internet is portrayed in a realistic way. No fake websites, no comments and people that feel out of touch, but everything feels like the real thing.
Also, the characters and motivations felt realistic. The way the father (mis-)handles the death of his wife when interacting with his daughter, him finding out he doesn't know her at all, his drive and (over-)ambition.
The final twist was a little predictable, but besides that, an absolutely outstanding movie. Great drama/crime/ thriller with loads of emotion that will have you shed a tear.",Searching

423,ryancortero,A very unique way of storytelling,9,14 September 2020,"Searching is a mystery thriller film starring John Cho, and written by Aneesh Chaganty who also directed this as his first feature film. The whole movie is presented through electronic screens in a very creative way (If you have seen season 6 episode 16 of Modern Family, it is similar to that).The plot is that a father (John Cho) is trying to help find his 16 year old daughter (Michelle La) who went missing. The problem with watching at home is that I could get easily distracted or go on my phone, but during the whole movie, I was very immersed into the mystery. With the way it was presented, I felt like I was part of the movie. I like the way the movie sets up different things and makes you suspect certain people. With mysteries, there's a possibility that the answers may not be satisfying but I found it went really well in this movie.I really only knew John Cho from the Harold and Kumar movies, so seeing him in this role was like seeing a completely different person. John Cho does a really great job at playing the worried father who will do anything to find his daughter. Within the first 10 minutes or so, I already felt sympathy for his character.In my own opinion, Searching is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen. It may take a while to get used to how the film is presented, but I think it works well, especially in this day and age of technology. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes a good mystery.",Searching
424,Blogger66,Will ALWAYS remember this film!!,9,30 September 2018,"I saw ""Searching"" movie two weeks ago and couldn't stop thinking about it. Today was the point where I felt I need to get this out of my chest. No other movies are like this! Not just an original, but also one of the most creative films I've ever seen. I am going to skip all the explanations of the story and focus on the messages I've received from this movie. In the social media era, we face issues differently than ever before. David Kim (John Cho) avoided his grieving process of his wife's death. It built up inside him and lost himself as a person. He started to isolate himself and used media to communicate with his daughter (Margot), even though both lived under the same roof. For example, he reminded her when his favorite television show is on and texted her when she didn't do her responsibility like throwing away trash. It's a way of him staying in touch with his daughter while avoiding the grieve of his wife's death. Margot felt like she also lost her father after her mom died. She hardly could make friends for three reasons. 1) She's a female (usually females have a harder time to make friends compared to males in high school)
2) She's an Asian American. (Doesn't have the white privilege to make friends easier) 
3) She's sad. (Who would want to waste time spending with a miserable person in high school?)It's common for people like her to express her feelings through social media and felt important in an alternative world. She drowns herself with her addiction to the alternative world. Once Margot was missing, it came to David's realization that he didn't know Margot after looking through her social media activities. I found it interesting when it referred to Pokemon characters. Uxie as being the pokemon of intelligence for solving problems and erasing memories, and Chameleon who can hide and use camouflage. It was frighteningly amazing to watch how people in this society employ through social media. See how nastily pervert men can be. See how people could easily reframe themselves into someone else. How people can be so comfortable making rude comments through the digital world. How easy to find detail information about someone. I think people really forgot how different we are living in the digital world. The difference is beyond unbelievable amazing. I left the room thinking I should remain disconnected from social media. I am thankful for my decision to deactivated my Facebook, Instagram, snapchat, and Twitter accounts. I rated Searching with a 9. The only downside is the ending part where Pamela was guilty. Typically of a twisted story in Hollywood.",Searching

456,cornerofspace,An innovative examination of reality currently.,10,6 April 2021,"Searching (2018) has a simple premise but with a very interesting presentation.The film is almost entirely shot in the lens of technology (either with a webcam, a computer monitor, video tapes, phones, television screen, etc.) What this means is you're seeing the main character often through a lens, whether it's through the phone's camera, the laptop screen and what he's searching on Google, and direct footages he might be viewing such as a video tape.This sort of presentation puts us in an illusion that we are experiencing the scenes unfold in real time, as being physically present and observing the main character perhaps as a friend or watching these footages as the police. You can't help but follow along and try to guess what the main character will do next to unravel this mystery right in front of him.The theme is also fairly interesting. It is essentially examining social media in our present reality. A father eventually realizes that he doesn't really know much about her daughter after seeing what she does on social media. It made me question about what would happen to me when I become a parent. You can do your best as a parent, but your children might end up at a place you totally didn't expect.Now, this film is entirely fictitious, it is not based on a true event but it very well could be. It highlights how impactful social media can be and what a scary place it could be. It is a must watch for viewers who want to experience something different. While the plot structure and acting are fairly predictable, you can still sense the tension in many scenes. The film can show something as innocuous as a stock photo and make it feel sinister and wrong.I rated this a 10 because of how much this film surprised me. According to IMDB, the crew only spent under a million to produce it? That is a fine achievement given the stellar presentation of using technology in such a way to tell a story. I do have to add that the trailer is very misleading, however. It was building the film to be some sort of cheap horror flick, which is entirely not what this was.As a debut film from a new director, I am very interested in what he will make next!",Searching

However, this one was such a pleasant surprise... but first, the caveats. If lots of dialogue, investigation process, lack of awesome special effects and explosions, and ""relationships"" bore you, then pass on this one. By design, this movie will force you to read text of chats, e-mails and websites from the screen, so bring glasses if you use them. Also, if you have the attention span of a flea then forget this one. Finally... if you have utterly no idea of what the Internet or social media actually is, then best see this with a more savvy friend to explain some stuff.It is a suspenseful story that builds and takes some twists and curves along the way. The characters were very well acted, interesting and generally likeable... I ""cared"" about them. I was totally surprised by how the story ultimately unfolded, and loved the ending. I WARN you, though... do NOT, NOT, NOT read spoilers about this one because they will totally ruin the movie's payoff for you.

I truly was not sure at any moment what the next outcome of the scene would be or even if this was going to be a movie with a ""happy"" or ""sad"" ending.The movie did a very good job investing the audience into the main character to really ""feel"" the urgency and the pain they were experiencing.The music score also was well executed by guiding the audience to feel the moments of epiphanies when vital clues were discovered or when there seemed to be a dead-end to the trail.Nothing was predicable, however once the movie ended I was pleasantly surprised to notice that very minor hints were laid throughout the movie, alluding to the eventual conclusion.There were no plot holes I could recall. The use of social media, social engineering, and the internet was spot on. I was surprised to see that all the websites used were real (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Gmail, Reddit, Google Maps, etc). They were utilized in the same way any person would attempt to trace down somebody. Even the way people would ""troll"" in response to messages and comments were exactly how they would appear in real life.I also appreciated the accuracy of the technology to the time period. Using Windows XP as the operating system, AOL Instant Messenger and low resolution digital video for the scenes that take place 15 years prior, then seeing the evolution to iMessage, Facetime, and high definition video recording on a modern Mac and iPhone.The cinematography was also very unique and worked well. All camera angles were from cameras that would be in a laptop or phone. Something that didn't seem out of place since it's common to constantly be surrounded by personal video recording devices. That in itself was a statement of how integrated we have become as a society with our technology.I was truly invested during every second of this film.

467,tkmcc-08780,"Innovative, great story but may have reached a bit",8,14 September 2018,"To begin with, this story is told entirely through screens - computer monitors and TV's. It's surprisingly natural since we spend so much time in front of screens. While the movie is a great drama and crime story on its own, the use of screens is skillfully exploited to build plot twists, tension and pacing.The basic story really touches on family, loss and a father/daughter relationship that's both tragic and triumphant. Anyone with children will immediately identify with these elements. The use of screens is essential here as Cho (the dad) not only searches for clues to his daughter's disappearance but also slowly gets to know his daughter in ways he never knew. The search for clues is central to the crime drama and provides the backbone for everything else. Several sometimes subtle clues jar with the apparent story line, or just seem odd or important but aren't followed up right away. Unlike some other movies, in Searching these are intentional and do eventually lead to red herrings or an unexpected story twist.The movie does have flaws. While the use of screens is very successful, there are some places where it's stretched a bit to make it work. Some of the clues stretch credibility, but I didn't think it was too distracting. I suspect that if I watched it again I'd find some more loose ends, but the innovative screen approach and frantic pace of the movie makes these a harder to pick up, at least for me.",Searching

Apparently there have been a few attempts at these before that I hadn't heard of. To put it simply- I was blown away how engaged I was.The pacing of this movie is incredible- there were countless ""edge of your seat"" moments where you thought you had the central mystery figured out only for it to take multiple turns. None of it was hard to follow or caked in layers of symbolism and hidden meanings either, unlike other suspense movies. Just good old fashion, build and twist storytelling.The attention to detail toward the way the father interacts with his screens blew me away in its accuracy. This is the most realistic film about modern technology and social media I've seen so far.Some details include: the way we type out messages only to delete them, the way we wait for a text bubble to appear and disappear in order to figure out if the other person is thinking to hard, the targeted depression ads that popped up for the father based off his obsessive search history, the scrolling binges, the social media stalking, and the and all the other little things you and I have done with our phones that we tend not to ever talk about.My only complaints are a lackluster(ish) ending to the story which felt a bit too... easy? I felt like it was building up to an INSANE weird conclusion, but was a bit let down by how the final 15 minutes unfolded. Also, there were not any super memorable moments or scenes (the kind that make you look back at masterpiece movies and play them back in your mind).This is a hidden gem forsure.

I thought I'd seen Chekhov's gun at some point, and I knew where this film was going. I didn't expect it to end the way it did, but I was glad that we get closure as the viewer. We know what happened.I've never seen Cho outside of a Harold & Kumar film, but his performance in this is fantastic. Thankfully not typecast into stupid stoner films, we get to see just how deep into the well Cho can reach to pull out a great performance. The whole cast was convincing on this film, we see a father go from being the cornerstone of a family to the close yet still distant single dad to a man desperately trying to find and hold onto the treasure that means most to him. It's a great whodunnit that doesn't make us sit through melodrama with actors exaggerating performances to seem emotional. I felt like the emotional element was actually realistic, this wasn't Twin Peaks levels of corny.I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention that yes, like everyone else says, ""hooray, this film got the technology correct for the real world,"" and it's kind of a drag that people have to compliment the film for being refreshing about THAT.

I was a little apprehensive towards the idea of seeing yet another film that uses the PC screen gimmick. After the somewhat mixed reception of the first Unfriended movie, all movies that have used this gimmick have just not done it justice for me. However searching succeeds where the others fail, characters. Searching is quite unique in how it develops character, it uses the advantages of its PC point of view to develop character in ways that are of course unique to this type of film and its PC POV. Another great positive about this film is the way it's paced. Although some might enjoy a somewhat slower film I for one loved how Searching kept me intrigued and at the edge of my seat from start to finish. Another great aspect of the film is John Chos's performance. It's not nuanced or artistically intricate, it's direct, straight to the point and effective. He more than capably carries the film hitting all the right notes in the time that he is on screen. However, not all is perfect in the film. My main issue with the film is found in it's third act. It's a bit of a spoiler so I will refrain from mentioning it, but I have to say that I think the movie kinda trips on itself towards the end. I wasn't all that big of a fan on how they executed the last 15-20 minutes of the film. A much better job could have been done, yet this pet peeve isn't big enough for me not to recommend this movie. Because in the end Searching is a film that utilizes its unique POV to tell a story about family in a way that I haven't seen before. It destroys the bad reputation that PC POV movies have nowadays and hopefully it teaches more filmmakers to utilize this unique POV in new and better ways. As of now I find myself liking this film enough to put it in my top ten of the year, so yes, watch it if you have the chance. I would highly recommend it.

This was very well done as you ride along with the main character as his roller coaster of emotions goes up and down the winding track as he searches for his missing daughter. There are a couple things I believe that could have been left out the movie for a more 'WTH' moment at the end but it hardly mattered. The movie carried itself regardless... for a good ending. I personally enjoy movies that have actors that I don't know. This movie in my opinion would have been ruined had Tom Cruise or Liam Neeson over-played the main role along with other well known figures. This father was actually believable in the role. I think the weak link in the movie was Debra Messings acting (the only actor that I recognized in the film). You'll see what I mean,,, though she wasn't exactly horrible. Bottom line: Though some things seem kinda far-fetched like the face-timing of the lead investigator as she sits at home or in the office, or how tech savvy the father is, or that the families entire life has been recorded to video and pictures,,, but overall I really really really really enjoyed this movie... and I believe you will too. I absolutely loved the ending. Go watch this.",Searching

The numerous plot twists appeared to be an homage to ""M. Night"" Shyamalan from a fellow Indian amateur film director with an obvious digital and iPhone/computer addiction, along with a fixation on Shayamalan's derivative plot twists that ended up becoming uninteresting after ""The Sixth Sense."" Since the writer and director of this movie was 22 years old at the time I can forgive him to a certain extent, but in the end there was no closure about what happened to Defective Vick or her son.

The ENTIRE movie takes place on a computer screen. Now of course I figured a great deal of the movie would involve a computer, due to the title. And I have nothing against computers...I spend half my life on one! Which is why I sometimes like to watch a movie to get AWAY from the darn computer screen.I kept thinking...soon this will all transfer OFF the screen and INTO real life...soon...soon...but no, that never happened. And that, evidently, is the ""gimmick"" of the movie.A gimmick is okay if there is also strong story telling and good character development. But without these vital features, a gimmick is just a gimmick. And that, my friends, is boring! Okay, not that the movie was boring...it's interesting enough (hence the one lone star rating I gave it). However, I don't believe anyone would want to watch this movie more than once. Why would you? There's no reason on earth. The people are all very 2-dimensional cardboard cut-outs....you don't care what happens to any of them since you don't get to know any of them as people! They are all just ""pawns"" in the writer's head, and that's it. Nothing more.I would have liked to get to know the daughter more...her idiosyncrasies...her personality...her likes and dislikes...then I would have cared a lot more about what happened to her. She is so devoid of character, it's disturbing. We see her staring blankly at a screen most of the time....why couldn't she have been given some character? Hey writers...that's what makes it all engaging! Some humor here and there might have been nice, as well...at least in the beginning....more ""humanity""....The plot seems very contrived. Someone posing as someone else online? Oh geez...like THAT'S never happened before (sarcasm)! A young father who has never even heard of the site Tumblr? Hard to believe. Many features of this plot seem totally unfathomable.This movie is okay (maybe) to watch once....(get it cheap, from Redbox, perhaps) just so you can experience the ""gimmick"" of an entire movie taking place on a computer (if you want to, that is)!

So why did i like this movie so much?
This movie is about a father who loses his daughter ""gone girl"" one night when she got to some study group. He gets a detective on the case and they together try to find his daughter. They use a very interesting way of showing this movie through the use of social media, and the entire movie are viewed through a computer.The characters in this movie give a very good performance all the way,
It is very good storytelling and a tension that creeps up your spine, and you feel like your more and more on the edge of your seat,
One thing that really kept me on the edge was the way they showed what is happening. You start getting drawn in and you look for clues and think about what is happening through the whole movie.
It is a whole lot of commercial of different websites here and it work good.
You kind of see the story of this girl through internet and i get this nostalgia feeling when you see the OS version from windows xp, the birth of facebook and youtube. All of this is done very great while also drawing you into the story.There is kind of a feeling that you are reading a Agatha Christie book and looking for clues and who the murder is. And it is some twists here and there that really shocked me.Who is this movie for:
I think if you like mystery movies, thrillers this is a good choice to go for.
If you like movies like Gone Girl, Disturbia, Unfriended or Prisoners this movie is a good watch.Summary:
I sit after this movie thinking and that i don't get much of when i watch recent movies. This was a very good put together movie with good twists, good performance, perfectly storytelling, very interesting points of view.Conclusion:
I got my first born child this year and after watching this and see how random things can happen in life. What can happen to your child unknowingly i sit and feel terrified. What is to come of her life and what is around the next corner.
As a fresh father thinking how much you get to love your child and always make things matter for her. How much will you get to really know your child.

562,lewismillican,Unique and gripping,8,19 June 2019,"With gusto and confidence 'Searching' tries and succeeds to break the boundaries or parameters of how a movie should be filmed and expressed. Stellar acting, coupled with an engaging form of cinema makes it an absolutely riveting pleasure to experience. With a method of cinematography and filmmaking that is particularly underused, 'Searching' makes it its own mission to develop a story that can be told in its entirety via a computer screen (or webcam) - and does so with resounding success.The computer is the core of this movie, and it is the content that the Kim family upload onto their computer that gives this movie legs. Right from the birth of their daughter: Margot, parents David and Pamela record and photograph everything for it then to be uploaded onto their computer. This is how the tone is set, the emotional attachment surrounding the family's special times that have been recorded creates a great narrative. Similar to 'Up' in that it manages to capture many years of life into a 10 minuet emotional rollercoaster of succinct, beautiful storytelling. Unlike what many may have expected the 'gimmick' of expressing through a computer screen and a curser really doesn't wear off at all. In fact it only gets more compelling when the inevitable happens in Margot's disappearance, the pun of 'Searching' really comes into play. Using social media and apple software as the main tool to do so, the familiarity of the process of 'searching' comes to the forefront - although with greater consequences.First time feature director Aneesh Chaganty does an incredible job in capturing the level of desperation father, David is going through, in the hunt for his daughter. Through discourse and his obsessive natural instincts as a loving father it made for an incredibly intense journey. The subtle links and clues that are spotted through photo's, texts and the dark web add to the aura , level of engagement and believability. What's more is the fact that this ambitious plot of twists and turns would have been a perfectly adequate thriller on its own without the 'computer' element. however, it's precisely the fact that Aneesh decided to film the movie in this way which makes it stand tall above other 'missing people thrillers'.No doubt Searching is bold, which is always commendable in any movie, but the fact that it pays off is extra special. The obsessive nature of David's online search for his daughter awakens the mind to the sheer power of the internet and computer software as a tool for both good and indeed evil. Searching is packed with quality performances, moving scenes, and awe-inspiring plot developments that will leave any thriller aficionado more than pleased with their choice of movie.",Searching

The story is simple but the way its been narrated to you is surprisingly unique. It has all the kinds of elements that you want to experience in a movie.

564,allisonlscates,Very original filming and suspensful movie!,10,3 July 2018,"I got the opportunity to see an advanced screening of Searching through the Atlanta Film Society and I really enjoyed it! A quick summary, it's about a father, David Kim (John Cho) whose teenage daughter, Margot suddenly disappears and goes missing. David desperately tries to find his daughter by going through her social media and her text messages, and he discovers there was a lot about his daughter that he never knew. The entire movie is filmed in a unique way, by it being presented through computer screens and POV shots. At first, when I saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be another one of those shaky camera, first person type filming (think Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield) and I was pleasantly surprised that it was nothing like that at all. I thought that the film was great. I like who-done-its and this one was done very well. It was excellently written and acted. Aneesh Chaganty does a fantastic job building suspense. What was good about the movie is that there are a lot of surprise twists that keep appearing as the movie progresses. When you watch the film, pay attention to all the little details, because they all build to something and serve a purpose in the film. Overall, I enjoyed the movie tremendously.

573,conn-57441,Surprise favourite film of the year!,9,12 September 2018,"I was one of the few that actually like 'unfriended' for trying something new in the horror genre, it obviously was not a perfect film but it was a fresh idea. With 'searching' we are given the same concept as unfriended but it is used in a much smarter way. From the first 5 minutes which immediately tug on your heartstrings ( think 'Up') to the way social media is shown to have a huge effect on police cases and those involved it just makes an almost tired film genre (missing person case) feel brand new again. John Cho ( usually known for his comedy roles) is also equally brilliant considering that we are just seeing his reactions on a webcam, watching him going through the motions of the case is heartbreaking at times. Like I said before this film is still a missing persons film so it does follow certain cliche moments at times and if you weren't keen on this type of film before ('unfriended') then you may not be swayed with this one, but I really did like this film, the twists kept me on edge and I would be happy to see what other ideas/ films could be done under this new, fresh film genre!",Searching
574,djkimtech,Surprisingly Intelligent Commentary,6,16 September 2018,"TL;DR This film is well versed in how the internet works and makes very smart commentary on how the internet works while having a pretty exciting plot. I would highly recommend this film despite its minor flaws that mainly come from how new this kind of filmmaking is.Whereas most other films tackle technology with the cynicism of a cranky, old man, Searching feels like a film that was made by someone who actually uses the internet and can make very intelligent commentary about the culture around it. While the premise of filming an entire movie on a desktop sounds incredibly cliche, and the general plot has been abused by the Hollywood formula one too many times, the creative decisions on how the mechanics drive the plot gives this film an incredibly fresh feeling.I love how the websites and software used in the film were real instead of made up. This choice kept the film grounded in reality and gave legitimacy to the arguments made by the filmmakers. One of my favorite points made by the film was on internet commenters. Yes, there are people on the internet who are ready to comment jokes ""so-edgy-that-it-could-cut-an-atom-in-half"", but there are also people who try to sympathize with those ""crazy people"" on YouTube, and Searching understands this mixture so well whereas some other films (Unfriended) believe that the internet is just 4Chan and Liveleak. This film also touches on topics such as internet fame, media, disconnect between people, and generational gaps with small comments. There arealso small gestures that give the character so much life, like how John Cho's character constantly types ""gmail.com"", it shows that he is kind of amateur to the internet, but not so much that he can't navigate around it which is in contrast to his daughter who appears to be a typical, tech-savvy teenager, and this dynamic plays into some of the major plot themes. This is small, but there are enough of these where the film becomes incredibly realistic and relatable. Aside from the filmmaking, John Cho's performance was great along with Debra Messing. I thought the camera movements really helped with the visual storytelling. Music was okay, it wasn't special to me but it did enhance tension and emotion in scenes where it was added.Other criticisms I have is that the plot is pretty generic. Don't get me wrong, the premise of the film kept it exciting and plenty of the twists were unexpected in my first viewing, but I am waiting for a film to create a plot around the premise rather than vice versa. Also, the use of real websites I feel could be a double edged sword in that it could date the film (remember pagers in The Wire?). The mouse movements were also really robotic and some scenes felt like they were hand feeding connections that the majority of the audience members would have already gotten already.In conclusion, this is a pioneer film in Desktop Filming or whatever this will be called. This film gives legitimacy to the technique and I am excited to see how it will expanded in the future. But in the meanwhile, give this film a watch.",Searching

First, although it is a somewhat standardized plot (girl missing), it is fresh, because it has many fascinating twists and turns with lots of entertaining and plausible red-herrings, so it would be a fun mystery no matter how it was made technically.But it is so marvellously original in its creation, using absolutely no conventional cinematography. Go-pro, cell phone cameras, drones and perhaps even more non-professional equipment combined with computer and smartphone screen-shots is combined in a tightly edited, beautifully constructed narrative. We have Jafar Panahi's brilliant ""This is Not a Film"" shot on cell phone, but Searching takes this non-conventional film-making to a completely new level.We got this on CD-ROM from Netflix, and I recommend highly that anyone who loves to study film get the disc, because it contains four extra features that reveal the film making/editing techniques, and also many hidden aspects of the film (Easter Eggs) that few people would see on first viewing. Many people will praise the film for its excellent Asian-American cast, but the production crew looks like the United Nations. Deborah Messing is the one principal non-Asian actor (she does a great job).I am living in San Jose, where the film is set, and the film looks just like San Jose--tech-savvy, multi-ethnic and hip.

Maybe these are the same reasons of the low rankings.
That is not the usual same cut movie as always.And I liked the acting! Again it seemed more real (to me) then the cut from same cloth, glammed up, Hollywood movies. So I liked the whole idea and the execution!

The taped confession was the only time I thought the acting felt quite bad.But even though I liked the movie, I was still a bit scared of the ending.
I told my husband: this is a movie, where the ending will form my opinion on the movie.
And it did!I wanted to give the movie 10, initially.And I would say, for me there was two endings. The first where we find out what happend to her. That was SO American, and everything I would expect from a Hollywood made movie. I honestly thought the believability went down the drain!
That was so unlikly! And so sensationistic. Again what I would expect from American police shows or American movies..
I was really disappointed! To me it didn't, at all(!) follow that ""real"" feeling, I had had through out the movie.The other ending is where they find her.
That ending I think was more realistic, and even though also so American feel good ending, I would have liked that so much more, with out the ""killer cop"", storyline.
I think they could have gotten that same ending without the sensation-horny first ending!The only other thing that I didn't dislike, but think could have maybe used more energy on, was the media reaction of others, the schoolmates, and theory's of the dad being/not being the murder..
But maybe that's because we see it from the dad's view, and he doesn't want to go further into those things..

I especially liked (if you can say it in this way) how some people in the movie are shown, using such tragic event of the disappeared daughter for the own profit or popularity, like a girl who first said that she didn't have much to do with Margot, the missing girl, but suddenly says about how she was her best friend etc., also clickbait articles like ""10 reasons why this happened to Margot"" etc.
But most importantly it shows how social media or an unlocked account can give you a whole picture of your life, if you see, which sites you visit, whom you have in your friend list in Skype or Social Media (of which some even say: We only met once and that's it. We don't have anything else in common), what you do with online banking and how all of this can connect the dots to find out what you do, who you are, where you were, when and why. Or maybe raise some misconceptions as well, like when the father thinks that a random child, he saw on a website, could be the kidnapper of his daughter. Also it is shown how many people can use disguises on the internet, especially if you on a chat-room-type site and talk about private things. This is actually very good commentary, which also shows how your data can be used in the daily process. And how much people can hide in their real life, which they are not afraid to show off online.
Apparently this is director Aneesh Chaganty's first feature film and he did a very good job with this online thriller. I'm curious about the later projects.
I really enjoyed this movie. If you like, you can check it out as well.",Searching

When I watch a movie I ask myself: ""Would I be able to make such a movie?""
In this case, the answer is ""No"", because it takes a piece of brilliance to come up with such a unique idea when it comes to camera work and storytelling.What I like the most is the way that everything is shown - through the 'eyes' of the computers, which these days basically 'see' everything that is happening - it just takes a human brain, dedicated to putting all the pieces of the puzzle together, to solve such a mystery.The acting was great, excluding maybe the girl who played Margot (at least in my opinion) - her way of expressing the character seemed way too distant to feel close or relatable. Then again - that may be due to the fact that her character didn't have much going for her in the first place - seems like she was just there to be the person who the search revolves around and not much more. What I felt was lacking was the connection to that character, because at the end I realised that I was feeling more sorry for her father, rather than the girl who was assumed to be abducted at some point and brutally murdered.Overall it was a very pleasurable experience which left me eager to see more from Aneesh Chaganty in the future!",Searching

From the moment the movie powers up it grabs you and does not let go. After just seeing the film, all I want to do is watch it again. But I'm not made of money, so listening to the score will suffice for now...Whilst this isn't the first film told from this point of view, it is easily the best. 'Searching' has to be commended for the way it is made and put together, incorporating all the websites, apps and sounds we are familiar with today without coming off as a gimmick. The film instantly lets you know what it's trying be by having a musical score; Torin Borrowdale's score is beautifully done and is perfect for the film.
 
The plot is about a father searching for his missing daughter on her laptop and it is incredibly investing. The film is thrilling but also features a surprising emotional core that I did not expect. I found myself really caring for the characters and everything that was happening or had happened to them. The performances here are fantastic and John Chu isn't spoken about enough.

690,storm-of-bt,An interesting and mostly original concept,9,17 September 2019,"This is an interesting take on alienation within a family, on social media, both its advantages and dangers, and on parental love.The concept is very fitting to the theme of the movie. From the beginning to the end, we see a computer screen. Not exactly a groundbreaking new format, let's just remember an underrated movie called Unfriended, but it works well, because the story is about a father seeking for clues about his disappeared daughter on her social media. The format can be taken as the renewal of found footage, this way conquering other genres where the screen format works better.The only problem is, this format hardly works on the big screen, even if it's a very cost-effective one, and it will always have its haters due to this reason. Shame, as some movies already lose plenty of praise they would deserve for the lamest reasons, like this movie.The real driving force of this film is tension. As we're locked into the father's access to the outer world, we can truly feel how weak he is, and it makes the viewer crazy. This, however, doesn't mean he can't do anything, and that's another plus for the film. His character not only uses social media and computer possibilities to the maximum of the user level, but also displays a very common and very unspoken thing: alienation within the family. Because he doesn't actually know his own daughter, and when he has no choice but to admit this, huge thumbs up for the writers here: the movie doesn't take a U-turn to save him, he has to admit it. More movies should do this.Another source of tension is the mystery. As the investigation of the father meets multiple dead ends, it keeps the viewer in constant guessing about what happened to the daughter. The movie shows plenty of aspects of the social media, online friendships without real life meaning, public shaming with or without reason, the habit of people writing terribly idiotic or irresponsible comments, and fake identities. One of the reasons this movie works this well is that it doesn't pretend that what its characters go through is unique or unreal. Except maybe for the final twist, it doesn't really show things that couldn't happen to anyone.It's far from flawless though. The final twist, even though a nice twisted mirror image of parent-child relationships when compared to David and Margot, feels a bit out of place. The fallibility of authorities is a neat idea, but this movie should have had a twist more related to the theme of the movie.Not much point in describing the technical details, as all are determined by the concept. The acting is acceptable, and the details overall make a consistent flick. The only problem is, music feels mostly out of place, as it's truly unnecessary for the most part. Unfriended was wiser on this regard, having no score at all.Overall, Searching is a unique, high tension thriller with a brilliant concept that doesn't really work on the big screen, but when you watch it on the small screen, a rare gem within its genre, and for a certain extent, beyond.",Searching

I don't think I stopped the movie once during its playtime and the story of the father is one which will be treasured by those who watched it along with the quality of the movie.

From beginning to end, Searching stays dedicated to delivering the story second-hand through computer/cell phone/television screens. This is an editing feat that was seamless throughout, and will hopefully not be ignored during awards season. Delivering the story completely through laptop/cell phone chats is so familiar to the viewer that the movie acts as a trap, locking us up and immersing us in the story. I believe this is the first movie of it's kind.The story itself is clearly well thought out - I spotted no plotholes and found myself cheering on the twists and turns the writers were able to take me on. The story, combined with the style create a pleasant level of suspense.Equally impressive was the performances of the cast. In a movie that's hyper realistic and modern in delivery, the acting also had to be realistic and modern. We get that in this film, all the way from grieving father to douchey internet troll. Cho proves his versatility, as I would guess he's on the screen for at least 60-70% of the movie.To summarize: if you've ever lived your life through your computer screen or your cell phone, see this film.",Searching

There were so many twists and turns that I had no idea how it was going to end, and some of the twists and revelations were bone chilling, shocking and more or less...scary.John Cho and Debra Messing were as fantastic as ever, showing such raw emotion that ultimately makes parts of the film sad.To bring it back down to earth though, I will say that there are moments (very few!) where you'll maybe need to suspend your disbelief a bit. However it's only to move parts of the story forward and never interferes with the major plot of the film.One of the big reasons this film works is because of how real it all feels. There is no reason at all that this sort of thing couldn't happen tomorrow...and that's whats scary the most.Overall I think this is a brilliant thriller that is beautiful and terrifying to watch and well and truly delivers on the twists and shocks.

For example, audience is easy to skip the first appearance of Robert in Pam's notes -- ""had a crush with Margot"" at the first glance. These kinds of details make the whole story complete and rounded. It worth watching the movie again to find out how the directors implicitly indicate the ending.BTW, John is an excellent actor.

I was streaming The Killing on iOS.,5,21 November 2018,"I knew nothing about this movie before I saw it, which is an approach that often works for me with movies when they're recommended by someone I trust. But be warned that this is one of those movies (like an episode of Modern Family that I think I remember?) where everything happens on the desktop of a computer (much more bearable for a 20-minute sitcom than for a 2-hour movie). I think if I had known that going in, I'd have had a different attitude toward it, but after the first 3 minutes I spent the next 5 wondering if the whole movie was going to be like that or if it was just a way to brush past the mother's death of cancer and become a potentially lame depiction of single dad/daughter bonding. It didn't go that way. I thought it took a bit long to get down to the real story, but that may have been just based on being a bit testy after realizing the computer footage was going to last as long as the movie did. As far as whether the movie was good, aside from the casting of Apple products as main character, I'd say it was about like season 1 of The Killing--girl is missing, we don't know whether she's run away or whether something more sketchy has happened, parents are worried and their relationships with significant people in their lives start to fall apart, and then we learn more about the missing girl. One difference would be that this was condensed into under 2 hours, so it wasn't able to develop things the way The Killing did. Another is that the ending was a bit more positive. But like The Killing, it came about as a plot twist that was low on believability and high on desperation, as it felt like the filmmakers badly wanted you to leave without a bad taste in your mouth. Even the villain did what was done out of parental love.... I felt that the filmmakers took me for being a bit naive, addicted to technology enough that I wouldn't mind watching a movie that was basically someone else using a computer, and very much in need of a happy ending to rescue me from an otherwise dreary life. No, what I need for that is to get away from my computer for a while and to see a movie instead, which isn't what happened here.",Searching

So I honestly expected this movie to be similar-- boring and uncomfortable to watch. It wasnt. It was in and out off the theaters so quickly, that I didn't get a chance to watch it on the big screen (would have been amazing). So I ordered it On-Demand after it was released. My mom decided to join me and my sister in watching the movie. However, my mom being in her early 40's, I was scared she would have a difficult time understanding what's going on considering it was all ""online"". To my surprise, she was able to understand everything that was going on and what the characters were doing. So definitely this movie is good for the older crowd.We were down right amazed with how well the story was placed together. And how it leaves a mystery-type theme. As someone who loves mystery, and I mean LOVE mysteries (movies, books, videos, ect) it has become normal for me to predict the ending of a book or movie before its even half way. This movie was refreshing, because at no point did even briefly guess the ending correctly. And trust me, I strung together a bunch of theories while watching this movie.The team that worked on the technical aspects did an amazing job keeping the online use as realistic as possible. No knockoff websites. No ""Yoogle"" or ""VideoTube"" or ""Facegram"", like many movies that need to show online websites. Even the comments that was shown under a Youtube video during a scene with YouTube were super realistic.The story and the execution of said story was amazing. Well put together. At no point during the movie was I ever bored. Never drifted away to think about pizza or even check my phone lol. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time.

Being more of a classic movie viewer I wasn't sure if this was something I could get into. Just from watching the trailer I got this feeling it was a modern spin on the Blair Witch genre. But no, it's more Catfish meets Frantic, but without the violence of Taken. I think that makes a little bit of sense. :)
I was very pleasantly captivated by it.It's very modern indeed, capturing a father's search for his daughter, and using every available resource he knows she might have come into contact with.
It's a parent's fear to find out their child has a somewhat secret identity. A whole alternate life, and all that goes with it.This film shows us all the good and bad sides of social media, and how truly fake people can be. ""I was her best friend"". That line really curled my toes.
I fully agree with a reviewer calling the ending sceners ""a bit Hollywood"". I think that could have been dialed down, since it certainly looks like it was sped up.

However, I decided to stick with it and was very glad I did. This film is surprisingly (for me anyway) good and I know the 'youngsters' with love it. I guess John Cho's acting sucked me in initially as his performance was so compelling and believable. I really felt his child was missing as he went through the range of emotions of being an irritated dad to his daughter's slovenly behaviors to slowly getting anxious at not being able to reach her. I found my anxiety built with his and that is the true measure of a great actor when the viewer gets sucked in. I finally found that the technology, which is so crucial to the story, didn't annoy me so much after a while and I was quite fascinated at how it can be utilized in trying to find someone. It was nice to see Messing in a more serious role (like her appearance in a previous Law & Order: SVU episode) and her performance sucked me in too. I did early on think something 'fishy' was going on but was completely off base with the final outcome. A film worth watching for the suspense, intrigue, Cho's believable performance, and above all, the incident of a teenager going missing which unfortunately in real life is all too real and terrifying for parents who go through this nightmare.",Searching

It's told purely from a point of view of a laptop, news footages and text messages; much akin to movies like Unfriended but done way better.You truly care for the father and his search for his daughter mainly due to the fact that this family's story is well fleshed-out enough for you want this search of his to succeed. Making us care about characters through this format of filmmaking is tough especially when you don't have much of a good script at hand but director Aneesh Chaganty seems do it with utter ease.The father character, David Kim played by John Cho is an extremely well- written character who doesn't fall in the same category of ""I'm a worried parent who waits for the police to do everything"". While he is worried throughout the movie after his daughter's disappearance, he also doesn't sit back and cry about it. In fact,he does a lot of the cyber-sleuthing himself and finds out more information about his daughter's disappearance than the police in the movie. In other words, he's smart character that's brought to life by a brilliant performance by John Cho.Deborah Messing is also really good in the movie as a detective who ""helps"" him find his daughter.

790,russlawrence,Not Horrible... Not Great...,5,12 May 2019,"So I saw this and read all the reviews after.
People shouldn't complain about the movie being done in the internet /digital world style that it was done in, as that was the moviemaker's intent and it was advertised as such.
All in all I think that was done well as many reviewers have suggested.
So I looked at it as a movie... How well did I like the movie...?
Well... It's a mystery movie, which I like. The plot does have some twists that are unlikely, but not impossible, especially if you paid attention (the cop tells the story that her son did bad things and she covered for him... She said that the two search zones had already been explored, etc). Many mysteries have solutions that are on the outer edge of the plot and characters, so this didn't annoy me fully.
I suppose it's possible... Barely possible... that the girl could have survived injured at the bottom of the ravibe for basically 7 days... There have been many true stories of survival like this.
There are some minor things that tech savvy people will catch (they don't try to use a find my phone locator, etc), but they don't destroy the movie.
The main reason I give this a 5 is the horrible acting of Debra Messing. If they had positioned her character as a friend of the family who also happened to be a police detective, then it would have at least been more believeable.
But as they did not, her acting is really attrocious. Seriously.
She doesn't speak, act, sound, or feel like a detective AT ALL.
She says things like ""gun wound"" (instead of gunshot wound).
I don't even want to go on about it because it was so bad.
If they had had a different actress in her role, I honestly believe his movie could have been a 7 or 8 for me.
So for me it's a decent mystery movie, told in a unique style, with a strechably possible plot twist and happy ending which could have easily gone the other way, but with a very poor choice for one of the lead roles.
It's worth a watch, even if it's just to see how they used the digital style and social media aspect.

The film features plenty of twists and turns, and packs an emotional punch on the way to a rollercoaster finale. Ultimately, Searching employs a style of filmmaking built for the social media age, whilst operating like a typical suspense thriller. Searching does not rely upon these technological platforms as a storytelling gimmick, though. The technological platforms instead are used to better demonstrate the disconnect that can occur between a parent and child when faced with tragedy. The film continuously shows ways in which advancements in technology have dramatically changed family interaction, for better or worse.Google, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, iPhones, online videos, desktop and laptop screens are all tools used in different scenes throughout the film. The different modes of communication are integrated seamlessly. Today's younger generations use technology with ease to interact with peers, as well as conceal certain truths, projecting only an image they deem fit to display. In the film, we see how young people may take advantage of these platforms to express themselves in an honest way online that they simply cannot do in the company of a parent.The experience of viewing Searching presents a few questions: Despite the unprecedented access people now have to one another, whether by phones, screens, or text, does the communication itself between us really improve? What is the definition of a friend in this digital world, when the term friend is so casually used? And what, if any, are the differences between our ""real-life"" persona, and the ""digital"" one we choose to create? In some ways, Searching reflects a kind of cultural adaptation to the digital age that individuals and families must make, in order to effectively communicate. First time feature director Aneesh Chaganty has pulled off a visual magic trick, and a new cinematic language has either been invented, or perfected.",Searching

This has to be one of the worst films made in the past 20 years. I have no idea how it has a 7+  rating, as the whole movie is basically watching a computer screen, as the main character looks through social media accounts, pulls up old video family files, and then occasionally is calling friends and parents of his daughter, as she has gone missing which is recorded through the computer video as if you were watching someone in a video conference call through Facetime. I ended up forwarding through the movie, as I couldn't locate my blue-light filtering glasses, and kept hoping there was some actual scenes with character interactions outside of the laptop.

It featured mostly real websites and stayed within the limits of reality when it comes to his snooping around the internet for clues.Secondly the pacing is pretty good too with a solid story that keeps you engaged and offers surprises throughout.While not the best acted movie, the acting is certainly solid enough to get through the movie and they manage to make you care about the characters in a short amount of time.Overall I'm pleasently surprised and the high rating is a combination of the solid story and that fact someone managed to finally pull off this concept correctly.

825,Victorhgm643,A Masterclass in Storytelling,8,3 November 2018,"The Plot is, for Aristotle, the soul and most important part of a tragedy. With only this sentence I can explain how good Chaganty's Searching is. Oh wait, there is another one: Where Aristotle defines anagnorisis as ""a change from ignorance to knowledge, producing love or hate between the persons destined by the poet for good or bad fortune"". Now we can talk about Searching.Told by a computer screen, it would be very easy to assume that the movie was going for some sort of gimmick of the ""computer screen"" sub-genre, but when a friend told me ""Hey, it's very good, you'll like it very much"" I had to see with my own eyes. To start, Searching is a Masterclass in Storytelling, if you don't believe me, ask Aristotle. Using screens (not just computers) to tell this story somehow enhanced every single plot point possible. The screens of everyday techs are very well constructed, always with a camera (FaceTime) where we can see what's happening. Not only the digital world is well conceived, but the scenery behind the cameras are too. You know it's not a horror movie, but still you keep watching out every corner behind the protagonist, looking and waiting for something go wrong. The ambient the movie creates is so immersive that there's a scene that apparently is not on a screen (but it turns out to be) that almost cut me off like ""Why are you showing me the real world? Get back to your MacBook"". And by the way, the movie uses real apps and that's awesome.
The cast was fine for me. It's not a Daniel Day-Lewis type of acting of course, but they were good. A worried father, a compelling detective, a believable teenager. It appears that they were not even acting and that's the point, right? Same goes to the immersive soundtrack, punctuating every something-is-off moment, which made me feel like I was watching a true crime story on Discovery ID, but with better editing. Speaking of which, the editing took like one year and a half to master every mouse movement, every backspaced word and new tab opened so we could feel every thought passing through David's mind and invite us to investigate with him and his theories.But the golden ticket here is the plot, definitely the plot. The way the story (and Chaganty) controls the information, the foreshadows, the unchaining of events and of course the anagnorisis moment. There are no loose ends, there is no useless dialogue, every word written on the screen matters. The way the film criticizes the social media community is brilliant, showing the hypocrisy and toxic face of the new digital empathy in a way no other movie has ever done - in just one scene. By the end of the movie, everything has come full circle by resolving the problem and not just the mystery. One last thing is the way information is delivered through the scenes. The best way to conceive information is through the natural unfolding of the story and the second best way is through reasoning. Oh, that's just the way the plot gives us clues, inciting the audience to think and participate, culminating in the big HOLY F moment. Searching is so well done that if you foretold the ending and it """"ruined"""" you probably weren't as mesmerize with all those things as I was, but that's ok. It's one of the best movies of the year, because it's well done, well planned, clever and unique.

Everything that goes on the screen, from the plot to the choreography to the plot, it is does amazingly. Often when we see movies dealing with technology in a dark tone, they are often bad, as was the deal with Unfriended or The Circle. However, the reason that those movies weren't well received while this one is is because of how it handles what is being given. We see how the father, played masterfully by John Cho, can use his computer to Facetime his daughter, to call her, to text her, and to manage images and other normal things people often do with their computers. However, during the movie, he has to see what his daughter has been doing, and someone mentions Tumblr. The father, obviously out of touch with what most teens are doing these days, types in ""Tumbler"", oblivious to how it is actually spelled. This is to be expected from his, as he is middle-aged, and hasn't been a teenager in a while. There are also many other examples of how realistic it is to operate a computer. He is constantly trying to access different accounts, and he is going back and forth with everything he's doing, and this is something that people of all ages could do.One of the most important parts of making a movie like Searching is to find ways to keep your audience on the edge of their seats. It does just that, and by not showing plot down our throat. While most crappy thrillers will just blow us all away with too much information, Searching carefully takes it's time with the script, and makes sure that nothing is left out. Every aspect of this movie, every character that is formally introduced, is worked is beautifully into the plot, which is something that every mystery should do. Also, as far as plot twists go, Searching finds a way to make sure that every single twist and turn in the movie is somehow understandable, or at least works. I would say, though, that the only thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that the director included a short film at the beginning before the movie. Then again, I'm very happy that he's trying to get the public open to what newer directors can do, and it's really just me not liking the film, but whatever.Searching is probably one of the most exciting films of the year, and the fact that it's a PG-13 thriller with a directorial debut, it shows you how far everyone in the film can go. Seriously, I haven't been this on-the-edge-of-my-seat excited since the ending of Mission Impossible: Fallout. The director, Ameesh Chaganty, has a wonderful career ahead of him, as he both directed and co-wrote the film. A must see for anyone looking for a good time.10/10",Searching

843,u-66754,A warm suspense,8,12 December 2018,"#Spoiler alert
The depiction is attractive. Comparing to watch this movie in the cinema, it's much better and more suitable on the laptop.Compared with the suspense part, I would rather consider the mainline of the film is the repair of the relationship between father and daughter. Such as scanning daughter's Facebook page, collision in Peter's home and description of Margot's classmates, those are essentially father's exploration on daughter's inner world. Finding his daughter under the cliff, could be regarded as a salvation towards Margot, also a salvation towards David after losing his wife.In the mid-late part of the film, I think the suspense part is kind of dragged by digital equipment, not expressing the climax perfectly. And the clues are kind of straight, the exploration is brief and simple. So what attract me most in suspense part are the searching part on Internet and the reversal part in the end.This film kind of reminds me of an episode in Modern Family, which is also used digital equipment to drive the plot. But the influence of other characters is more essential for the screen and the plot, comparing to Claire of Modern Family in that episode.The most impressive thing I've felt is that, the influence of family relationship is REALLY huge. Except David and Margot, the relationships of David and Peter, Vick and her son, really show me the difficulty of parenting and family relations. And the Internet is so well-developed, that we can search anything we want on it. It's fun to think about the willingness of exposing oneself on the Internet.

They should have left the female detective out of the whole scenario, I would say.
Five stars is ok. if you are not looking for a higher meaning (critizing social media and all that).One more thing : just watched the commentaries of the production staff on the DVD. Putting aside the content, doing a project, first meant to be a short film, by joining the actors only via computer screens in different rooms is a new radical way to show our sometimes bizarre lifestyle and for that alone I could give 7 stars, but doing a whole film, they could have opted for a more logical approach and ending.",Searching

I can only speak for myself, but thisis possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. Through and through, this movie checked all the boxes you can think of. I cried 3 times, of both joy and fear. There was a moment when I felt so much fear and anxiety from feeling the emotions of the characters through the screen, that it gave me an uneasy feeling in my stomach. And I feel that's a good thing, because it means the director and cast flawlessly executed the incredible task of portraying raw emotion to the audience. Just see this movie for yourself. It's not even 2 hours long, and even then it flies by if you are completely engaged, which you should be.

Searching was a movie that will hold your attention throughout it's duration. In contrast with other movies that have been filmed the same way it doesn't look cheap and forced.
It doesn't present the internet in an over exaggerated version. It is actually realistically depicted what you can and what you cannot do as a simple user.
It hits the nail on the head for parent-child relationships when there has been a death in the dynamic, the struggles parents face to talk to their children while dealing with their own emotional mess.

908,SadPugh,Searching,7,2 October 2018,"Note: I written this review back at the start of September, however my opinions here definitely haven't changed. I came out of Searching very surprised and impressed. I never felt bored, I always found myself engaged the whole way through it's runtime, and it has twists and turns that I did not expect. Essentially this film is about a father trying to find information about his daughter's disappearance, but it is all done through a computer, unlike films like Unfriended, which used it as a gimmick and ultimately, failed miserably, This film uses it as an advantage. There are so many little details that makes the film feel so real and believable. Little things like older operating systems depending on whether it's in the past or present, it just helps add so much to the experience to make it feel real. It's very clear to me how much care and effort was put into creating this film, and it's a breath of fresh air to see a film like this that actually succeeds in what it wants to do. I also noticed that there was a bit of foreshadowing on the computer at one point, and it really caught my eye, it made me wonder if it was intentional or not.Also the performances are really damn good here. Shockingly, John Cho was fantastic, as was his daughter played by Michelle La. So mostly, the acting is great, and a lot of it felt believable. They also decided to put a musical score in the film. That worked surprisingly well. It's not anything amazing, but it's a nice little touch that added to the overall experience for me. As for flaws, sometimes there are sound effects that were added obviously to make it feel cinematic, but sometimes it just distracted me. Just a little nitpick but I thought I would mention it. Also despite the really great performances here, there are a couple of people in the film that didn't do that great of a job. Mainly when John Cho's character interviews some of his daughter's friends. Not a big deal but it should be mentioned.Nevertheless, Searching was great. If I rated it based on how much I enjoyed it, it would be a 9/10. But objectively based on quality, the film is good, and I honestly can't wait to watch this one again.",Searching

""Searching"" tells the story of a father who got to know the online side of her daughter through internet once she went missing.

914,micomariorivera,YouHateGoodMovies,9,1 September 2018,"What is it about crime dramas that interests us so much? Some theories suggest that they emulate the desire to explore the feelings of committing the crime as a release. Myself, its the dramatization and comfort of seeing the criminal pay for their actions. The satisfaction associated to an individual paying their dues for destroying the lives of others is enticing. It doesn't end there, beneath the surface of the adventure is the thrill of solving the puzzle with the characters on screen. The ""aha!"" moment connected to the resolution of the plot is addicting.In order for a film to support the wonderful ""aha!"" moment it must provide the viewer with enough clues to lead them there without being obvious. Searching (2018) overcomes this feat with its riveting solution to the disappearance of Margot. Margot (Michelle La) never makes it home after studying at her classmate's home one night, and her father, David (John Cho), begins looking into her unexpected vanishing. Searching begins with a wonderfully executed melancholy montage of Margot growing up through vlogs, and photos being uploaded to the family computer following with grief overcoming David and Margot as Pam (Sara Sohn), wife and mother, is diagnosed with lymphoma.

923,zhengxuan,A movie that needs to be rewarded: It manipulates you so well.,10,10 September 2018,"I watched this movie on Sep 9 with my boyfriend and both of us were very excited about it. I think many people have talked about how engaging the movie was for nostalgic reasons (e.g. the windows XP system, etc.) and the social impact. So I'll skip that and just talk about what I liked about the editing and the story structure.I think this movie is a close-loop. In the first half of the movie, it gives you all the hints that you need to solve the puzzle, but it ""manipulates"" attention so that you did not notice some of the hints. This is also why this movie is so ""successful"" as a computer screen movie. Every zoom-in urges you to follow the Dad's focus and leads you to the information that it wants to show you. Comparing the first time the Dad searched Vick and the second time, the same websites, but different focuses and more information. I felt like I was tricked just like in the Gorilla experiment! In addition, the logic of this movie is very rigorous. Almost every single turning point/ decision point has a hint or multiple hints that you can link back too.On top of that, I have to admit that this movie was unpredictable. There were several turning points where I did not expect at all, which is very rare in most of the recent movies. This is just simply something that the commercial movies and their equations cannot create. I remembered at one point, I had a stupid quick thought to explain what happened and I was so embarrassed about that thought. This is how many rises and falls there are in the movie. Even though there were so many dramatic conflicts in the movie, they all seem reasonable and credible. It's so hard to show how I feel without examples/ spoilers. But you will understand me after you see the movie!Of course, there are some limitations, especially if you have to present everything thorough computer screen. One thing that bothers me a lot was the extreme use of FaceTime. Do people in California always use FaceTime?? When David was asleep and Margot was calling him through FaceTime, it automatically triggered the camera, which I did not know before and was a little concerned about it. But generally speaking, this movie probably is one of the best movies that I have seen in two or three years. Definitely worths the attention and definitely needs to be rewarded.",Searching

I have seen John Cho before but only in his more comical performances in the ""Harold and Kumar"" trilogy and to be honest I am very glad that I got to witness John Cho's performance in this film. The style of the film might scare you because you might think this to be another ""Unfriended"" situation but in reality it is far from that. The story is told through the screen of a computer and it is done fantastically, letting you feel as if you are also looking at the screen and witnessing the same things as David Kim is. The music score is perfect and doesn't give crappy emotionless feels to itself. The best part of of the film has to be the story, every part of it makes sense and there aren't a lot of parts that make you need to rethink something. The big twist of the movie is amazing, I haven't been emotional distraught after watching something like this but this did it for me. Not on a sadness side but more of a lost for words situation.

One thing that doesn't make sense.

BUT the only part that really doesn't quite sound right is that... I don't think detective Vick has made the right choice to begin. She wasn't impulsive. Given she's an experienced detective, Her judgment in choosing to cover up for her son is completely irrational. It was an accident- She didn't have to do that.

Now, if you are a teen's parent, hold on to your hat because you might find some bites difficult to digest, it might catch you off guard, even leaving you questioning your parenting skills. It could also make someone feel a bit naked regarding social media exposure and privacy.
It seems difficult to manage camera coverage while shooting a ""screen setting"" movie, somehow they make it work taking a dynamic approaches, which add up to a more natural flow and continuity to the film
Overall entertaining, absorbing and contemporaneous, it effectively diverts from sub-genre misfires out there which are stiffer and downright flat (unfriended 2014)
On the downside, the story's gripping effect is countered by the simplicity found in its elements, which pervade the cinematic aesthetics, a sort of real cinematography mimicking, it actually tasted like I could produce a film with a laptop and a cellphone right at my spot (I say it without consideration to how hard that would be of course).

The writing, directing, and casting were all poor..I usually like John Cho and Debra Messing, but they didn't work at all in this context, and the actress who played the daughter was underwhelming. There was really no tension or suspense at all, the way it was presented. It felt like a made for TV movie, written by a 13 yr old.It's quite obvious to me that the studio shills were out in full force for this one.

I especially loved the way the story was told.The whole movie is shot in a way which puts us inside of the computer but still let's us observe everything that is happening. There has been a few movies that have done that in the past few years but in my opinion none of them were executed as well as this one. The cinematography is beautiful and feels natural, and so is the framing of every scene.The story in the movie, while not very unique, is still written in a great way and really complements the cinematography of the film, especially in the moments of silence that occur pretty often. My only complaint is probably the ending, which in my opinion is quite too bizarre and in a way comes out of nowhere, but other than that I really enjoyed the story.As for the sound, I found some of the sound effects and the sometimes rare moments with music playing to be pretty distracting and at times a bit too cliche, but it's not a very big problem.Overall I really enjoyed this film and I'd recommend it to almost everybody. 8/10 -Very good, an enjoyable watch.",Searching

1139,mdf-16956,Best movie of 2018,10,12 October 2018,"Searching is an American thriller indie film written by Sev Ohanian and directed by Aneesh Chaganty. This movie is about a father, David Kim (played by actor John Cho), who is searching for his lost daughter, Margot Kim (played by actress Alex Jayne Go), by looking through her laptop in order to find her location. Although the movie received multiple awards at prestigious film festivals such as Sundance, some critics do not believe the film is worthy of this honorable recognition. One one hand, they see the film as being boring because the entire movie takes place on a computer screen. On the other hand, many others see that Searching is unique and groundbreaking for effectively taking on this daring concept. On the contrary, although movie reviewers will say that Searching adequately tackles this innovative notion, they believe that the rest of the movie forgets about the basics of character development and storyline. However, for the truth is that Searching's elements of storytelling through adds to the character development and storytelling therefore making it stand out from other movies. In this essay, by dissecting the film's spine-tingling score and sound effects, creative cinematography, and its realistic portrayal of modern society makes Searching the best immersive movie experience of twenty eighteen.
Searching's creative use of sounds constantly keeps viewers on the of edge of their seat. When David falls asleep, Margot calls his phone twice in the middle of the night. Although the sounds of a phone call may not elicit any emotional effect in a usual circumstance, the film accompanies deep synth music as well as an echoing effect onto the ringing of the call thus evoking an unsettling feeling of disturbance and imminent danger. Although Searching's score is creepy itself, what makes the film even more haunting is its use of silence. After all hope of finding Margot seemed lost as David sends a collection of pictures and videos to a funeral streaming service called Memorial One, an image of a girl holding flowers pops up onto the website. In this scene, David realizes that this girl was very close with his daughter through an online broadcasting service called You Cast. In this case, many movies will reasonably jump at the opportunity to add a loud sound jump scare effect as a cheap scare tactic in this particular scene. However, this film used nothing but silence to build as well as sustain an extreme level of tension and dread thus sending goosebumps through moviegoers' spines.
The unique and distinct cinematography in Searching never fails to lose the audience's attention throughout its run time. By taking on a unique concept of the entire film taking place on a computer screen, Chaganty was able to be creative and innovative in his choice of visual shots. For most of the duration of the film, the audience was able to see all of the characters in the movie through FaceTime. This particular cinematic technique is ingenious in which the audience can see the character's faces at all times. By being able to watch these character's reactions, the audience is able to emotionally attach themselves to the character hence becoming more engaged into the story. Furthermore, along with seeing David's face the entire time, the audience is also able to observe everything he is doing on his computer. In doing so, the audience discovers the same information as David does at the same time. By utilizing this cinematic technique, viewers experience similar thoughts and feelings to those of David's thus making the film seem less of watching experience but rather a live ongoing investigation. Although the idea of watching David investigate on a computer screen may seem tedious and claustrophobic to some, the film is able to keep watchers attentive through implementing computer software functions such as messages, email, maps, twitter, tumblr, instagram, and news broadcasts. By doing this over a long period of time, the audience is exposed to new features therefore never becoming bored. 
 Searching subtly yet effectively portrays society's destructive behaviors and tendencies in a realistic way in the online and offline world. After Margot's missing person report caught mainstream attention, people across the internet started to comment on the issue. On one side, Margot's ""friend"" who used her to get an A in an AP bio class posts a video of her crying about Margot's disappearance claiming that Margot was her best friend. This is a realistic portrayal of society today because most people today long for attention and will do anything they can to receive attention and love. On the other hand, internet conspirators posted several articles and posts that accused him of being a horrible parent and that he was the one behind Margot's disappearance. By showing these two sides of the internet, the film accurately reveals the ugly truths about social media in the 21st century. Another way Searching portrays society's problems is in David's father-daughter relationship with Margot. In the first half of the film, David believes that he has a good relationship with his daughter since they enjoy watching the Voice together and their texts are always lighthearted and happy. Once Margot goes missing, David frantically goes through her laptop only to realize that he wasn't close to her at all as he looks through her social media. Moreover, David isn't close with Margot because he avoids to talk about the taboo subject of his dead wife because he doesn't want Margot to feel sad. However, Margot has been suffering from depression ever since her mother's death and wants nothing more but to talk to her father about it even to the point where she rants about these feelings on her livestream. Consequently, their relationship suffers therefore making David and Margot's personal lives ever so distant. This is a contemporary issue in society today as many young adults struggle with depression privately therefore acting different online than in real life. In result of this, parents do not understand what their children are feeling because they didn't know that there was something wrong in the first place.
 Ultimately, Searching efficiently executes in its delivery of sounds, cinematography, and realistic portrayal of modern society. But what makes this film stand out when compared to others is its message about computers itself. Throughout the film, as viewers watch David look through and investigate Margot's computer, they begin to learn more about her. Although the majority of the film is investigating Margot's computer to find out her location, the film also show many personal family videos and photos. As viewers see David open programs through his own computer, they watch the Kim's grow and develop as a loving family. By rewatching these same videos over and over again, the movie addresses its most important message: Computers are not just a convenient device to work, but a time capsule of memories meant to be cherished and preserved.",Searching

In fact im still searching for a reason to rate it so highly. And the questions. oh are there many questions. **spoilers alert** ok so this whole premise relied on the fact that the detective could ""request"" the case. Okay fair enough. Then the area where the missing Margot was, the area the cunning detective declared ""searched"", to no suspicion, was not visited by anyone, anyone at all, for five days. A far cry considering it was a popular smoking spot, it was a weekend, and the case had garnered massive attention. Cyber pundits and arm chair investigators were all over the case. Yet we are led to believe an injured girl simply lied there, for five days, silently and undiscovered. Also questionable in it's believability, is the fact the detective somehow convinced an ex-con, an ex- con willing to attend rehabilitation, was willing to admit to a killing and proceed to kill himself to make it ""realistic"". Apparently ""drugs"" insured this went smoothly. A little too convenient for my liking. The 'brother did it' device was very predicable as a misdirection from the get go, and apart from the performance form the father, everyone else was fairly forgettable. Debra Messing was flat and didn't convince me as a psycho cop who thought she could pull off an impossible feat of misdirection, the only option obviously, to protect her odd son who decided to give some ill begotten cash back to someone in the best way possible : to spook the hell outta them near a ravine in the middle of the night.

Because it shows how teenagers operate in the now and where they are digitally present and taps into the horrors of somebody using this to their advantage. It masterly depicts the vulnerability of the teenager of the present time, the many online personas and the one window where you let your guard down online and are at your most vulnerable. These places have become super exclusive and usually as a teenagers you think they are guarded because you take the necessary precautions but not in this movie. That makes it one of the best thrillers Ive ever seen and so compelling because as a tech savvy person you can totally relate to it. Also the little details are uncovered that you think you're the only one aware of, as how to crack passwords and how to google someone fast. I thought I was the only one who was aware of this. haha
It also shows the generation gap that is perfectly illustrated here with a single father, who normally has a not so strong connections to his kids as a mother would have. And shows the different digital usage teenagers show compared to their parents. Apart from being a good thriller it is a great social study and a warning to parents if you really know whats going on in your kids head.

Technology is a necessity in the production of a film, but Searching takes this to another level by using the technique of screencasting. A screencast gives the audience the perspective of the person who is behind the screen. This technique can be tricky, but it makes it possible for the audience to feel apart of and involved in the story. Searching is categorized as a drama, mystery, and thriller and truly lives up to this. It focuses on a search for the main character, David Kim's, daughter. Margot is his sixteen year old girl who goes missing after a group study session for AP bio. With the help of Detective Vick, David Kim frantically tries to find his daughter, and he slowly uncovers the truth: he doesn't know his daughter as well as he thought. David Kim uses Margot's social media to figure out where she could've possibly gone. We follow his journey through a computer screen; a technique used similarly in the film Unfriended. Searching uses technology in an innovative way to execute its plot and is a thrilling movie everyone should watch.
The use of screencasting in the intro scene is vital in developing the characters. Searching begins with pictures and videos of the Kim family. Each member of the family has their own profile on the computer, and we get to know them as they each log on. Pictures and videos appear on the screen accompanied by soft, classical background music, which represent the nostalgic feeling you get as you look back at old memories. The audience also gets an inside look at events the family has planned in their online calendar. Because we aren't aware of the date, the timeline is presented to us as an update from a Dell to Apple computer. We no longer see the green hill background, but a new ball of light that moves around the black screen. This acts as a flash forward in time. The only speaking involved in the beginning is through a vlog David Kim starts with his wife. After we get familiar with the characters, the first dialogue during present day time is through a FaceTime call between David Kim and Margot. Screencasting helped develop the characters, and it also helped the audience follow every move David Kim makes on the search for Margot.
We can see what's going on in the minds of the characters through their google searches. When important information is put on the computer, the words or numbers become enlarged. The method of show don't tell really comes into play. This helps us to understand what we need to know for the next scenes without the characters verbally telling us. Searching uses different types of technology that is all displayed on a computer screen. iMessage, FaceTime, cameras, online news streams, a Memorial One livestream, and a website called You Cast all were incorporated into the movie to visibly show the characters and to communicate between them. A unique technique director Aneesh Chaganty used was to pause right at the climax, as a sort of cliffhanger. As the climax approached, the small loading symbol popped onto the screen due to poor connection and the audience was left in the dark, quite literally because it immediately went to a black screen. In most movies, the audience makes assumptions of what the character's next move will be. In Searching, not only does the audience visually see the characters, but they can see the thought process and every gear that turns in the mind of the person behind the screen.
Searching is rated PG-13, so I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone over the age of thirteen. Although some people might not enjoy screencasting, Chaganty uses it as a unique spin on a way to film a mystery. From beginning to end, the full 102 minutes, every detail mattered no matter how insignificant it seemed. It tugged at my heart strings, placed me on the edge of my seat, and gave me chills. Searching is a must see for everyone.",Searching
1210,josiah-00969,Technological Search,10,20 February 2019,"Having missed two calls from his daughter Margot, and a FaceTime call ringing, David Kim is shown sleeping through the face camera of his desktop computer. After the FaceTime call ends, the blank screen of an Apple computer is shown, and Margot's smiling face is shown in the contact photo along with her missed calls. Searching by director Aneesh Chaganty is about a single father, David Kim and his daughter Margot. In this film, Margot disappears, and the entire film is spent trying to uncover what happened to her. This disappearance leads David to realize he never really knew his daughter, and may never get the chance. Searching is worth the watch because of its stylistic elements, recurring details, and controlling music which will strangle your emotions and absorb your attention.
There are many stylistic elements in this film which I have never seen before and are very unique. First and foremost, the entire film takes place on the screens of modern day devices. These may include desktop computers, laptops, cell phones, and television screens. The producers of the film have done a good job utilizing different technology to really show how much we use these devices every day. It is very intriguing how they can tell an entire story mostly from David and Margot's computer screens. Utilizing this technological style, the movie shows the change of time though photos being added into the computer, and the change from an old DELL computer to the new Apple desktop computers. Additionally, because we all have devices like these, the film is much more relatable and has a real feel. Often times, the characters will FaceTime each other, and unlike usual films, the video quality is not perfect. The FaceTime camera often has some lag and glitches when you actually use it in real life, and the creators of the movie purposefully implemented some glitches and some shakes in the FaceTime video. This leads me to the conclusion that one, they literally filmed a lot of this movie using the real FaceTime cameras, and two, the realness of the video quality allows the audience to greatly empathize with the characters. Whether it is your call not being answered, or the call line breaking up, we've all been there before. This makes the movie feel like something that could have really happened which amplifies the emotional effect of the movie's events on the audience.
Early in the movie, the film makers place small items, which seem very insignificant in the vast clutter of someone's home computer, but hold great importance later in the film. Whether it be a casually dropped photo, a name of a store, or a website on the computer's browser, there are many small hidden allusions to later more significant events in the film. Obviously by the title of the movie, the characters are searching for the lost girl and why she was lost. When all is becoming revealed towards the end of the film, many recurring items from early in the film pelt the audience one after another showing their vast significance to the plot. The feeling this gives the viewer can only be described as mind blowing, terrifying, but yet amazing, and it will make the hairs on your arms shoot up. The sheer magnitude of unbelievable connections made throughout the movie while still retaining a magnificent plot is why this film will take you on a ride with the characters and make you feel present right in the movie itself.
The changes in music of this film can change the mood in seconds and can greatly assist in the story telling of this movie. If something sad happens, such as Pamela, Margot's mother, getting a disease, the happy melody remains but slower and softer which creates a sad tone, however when she recovers, the main melody is greeted by loud major chords which recreate the blissful bubble that the movie starts with. Later in the film, when David is really beginning to realize something is wrong and Margot may be in danger, the music is full of minor diminished chords which create an ominous and scary sound. The music itself is enough to send chills down your spine, which you might only feel after something terrible has happened in the real world. The power of the music in this film is very obvious and while often letting the audience know something crazy is about to happen, doesn't spoil the movie.
The emotional effect of these three features of the film on the audience is extremely powerful and forces the viewer to not take their eye of the movie. Searching is a gripping feature which is definitely worth your time seeing. Its music, small motifs, and modern style create a great platform for a film such as this. Anyone looking for a mysterious and suspenseful movie should definitely see Searching.",Searching
