0,MartinHafer,A film that I would put in my Top 10 Best list.,10,10 September 2010,"I love this film and can't believe I never got around to reviewing it until now, as I've seen it many times. I think I just assumed that I'd written a review for it or neglected to do one since it already has so many good reviews. Regardless, it's one of the best films ever--and possibly the best film Hollywood has to offer--it's THAT good.I think part of the reason I love this film so much is because it has perhaps the best opening scene in movie history. I adored the film's style and originality here. You hear William Holden narrating--narrating in a wonderfully cynical manner. And, as the camera pans down, you see a corpse floating in a pool. Suddenly, the camera is under water--and you see that the dead man is the narrator himself!! What an amazingly daring scene! And, to seemingly top it off, Norma Desmond's entrance is just sublime. But then you see that the film then works BACKWARD to explain how all this came to be--a truly wonderful style of storytelling! I could talk more about the film, but to me the beginning was THE film. Sure, Holden, Swanson and Von Stroheim were wonderful as well as Jack Webb in an interesting supporting role...but all you will probably remember is the introduction. And the directing and writing is wonderful...but you still keep coming back to the wonderful scene.The bottom line is that all would-be film makers should be forced to watch this film and learn from it. And, if such a thing COULD be done, let's also force them to watch ""12 Angry Men"", De Sica's ""Children Are Watching Us"", Majidi's ""The Color of Paradise"", and.......",Sunset Blvd.
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Savage, dark and original- a satirical comedy that is too good to be missed",10,1 April 2010,"After seeing Sunset Boulevard for the first time ever today, I was surprised at how good the film was. While witty, it is savage, dark and original, and is quite simply too good to be missed. The story, while stark, is brilliantly constructed, about a former movie queen haunted by memories of her past greatness, and the script is both canny and knowing, sporting great lines such as ""I am big. It is the pictures that got small"". Billy Wilder, director of Some Like It Hot and Witness for the Prosecution, both of which are hugely enjoyable, directs briskly, and the black and white cinematography, sets and costumes are fabulous. The music score from maestro Franz Waxman is outstanding, haunting, rich yet beautiful as well.Bringing the screenplay and the story to life is the superb casting. William Holden is excellent as doomed writer Joe Gillis, who narrates in flashback from the scene of his death. Gloria Swanson though is a revelation as Norma, not only wholly convincing but also bringing a desperate and somewhat vampiric glamour to the role. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a wonderful film, wholly deserving of its masterpiece status. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Sunset Blvd.
2,bkoganbing,The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame,10,26 January 2006,"In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.",Sunset Blvd.
3,SnoopyStyle,classic iconic performance,8,12 March 2016,"Joe Gillis (William Holden) is found shot and floating in the swimming pool of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Blvd. Six months earlier, Joe is a struggling screenwriter trying to sell his run-of-the-mill movie to producer Sheldrake but script reader Betty Schaefer belittles it. He's on the run from repo men and he hides his car in an old mansion. The mansion's owner turns out to be silent era movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She has delusions of making a 'return' to star in her script of Salome for legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Joe sees an easy way to make some money doing a rewrite. Slowly but surely, he becomes her kept man.Gloria Swanson gives an iconic performance for the ages. Her scenes on the Paramount lot are riveting. William Holden is great. It's a fascinating dissection of Hollywood and the fame obsession. There are a few moments of over-acting by some of the other actors which is weird since the movie is about the passing of the silent era acting. Norma Desmond has to be one of the top characters of all times.",Sunset Blvd.
4,Hitchcoc,It's a Gut Wrencher,10,24 February 2006,"I don't know why I'm attracted to this film. It is such a sick presentation of greed and pity. William Holden can't face the music in his life and so he latches on to this over the hill, mentally ill, star of silent movies. He does the gigolo thing. We can only imagine. He can't get off the mark and leave, though he has numerous chances to do so. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond gives the performance of the century. She is vulnerable and evil; she has the power from her wealth to keep Holden in check. Most people who portray these kinds of characters are hard to believe. She is a bundle of eccentricity and believability. And, like a little boy, he can't leave his mother. We get glimpses of his other life which seems glamorous and exciting, but he cannot give up that financial support and sells himself out; unfortunately to the nth degree. Billy Wilder is a skillful director and what he does with the black and white images (this film has to be in black and white) with the Norma Desmond poses and dreariness of her existence, just works so well. Of course, we all know the final scene. She is not to be dismissed to the very end.",Sunset Blvd.
5,mark.waltz,"Sunset Boulevard, twisting boulevard, every turn a little scary....",10,13 August 2014,"So sings the Joe Gillis character in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of this classic Billy Wilder film where every twisting turn of the boulevard and Norma Desmond's mind is felt banging in the viewer's stomach. William Holden is a starving writer who doesn't want to return the rented car and finds a twisting turn on his own destiny as he hides inside the mysteriously overgrown driveway off the twisted Bel Air area of the Los Angeles suburbs in order to hide from the men after him. He's in for more than he bargained for when he rings the doorbell of the dilapidated estate (shades of Grey Gardens) and finds a funeral for a chimpanzee going on. If the sight of dour butler Erich Von Stroheim isn't enough to get him to turn around and rush out of there, the sun-glassed older lady who mistakes him for an undertaker should be. But Gillis, an obvious expert in Hollywood History 101, instantly recognizes her. She's Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a silent movie star whose career ended years before, lost in memories of Valentino and Chaplin, and certainly not in tuned with 1950 Hollywood.As Joe will find out, you can't mess around with the emotions or ego of a Hollywood legend, even if she hasn't made a film in 20 years, because actors were commodities trained by the studios to make grand entrances at premieres and be oh-so-perfect, larger than life and like Kleenex, disposable when they are no longer needed. Today's headlines prove this still to be true as stars rise and fall with amazing speed even if they have less than 1 percent of the veteran star's magnetism.This movie was a sensation in 1950, not only because of Swanson's return to films after almost a 10 year absence, but because of its stark observation about how Hollywood cast out their former money makers just because they weren't as popular anymore. Studio heads were furious, but veteran actresses recognized the truth in it and praised Swanson for her guts. Even though the film got nominated for a ton of Oscars (including four of its actors) and is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, let alone greatest movie ever made on the madness of Hollywood, it took only one major award (writing) and two technical awards.Ripe for parody, drag queen impressions and rip-offs which had little in common quality wise with the original, this did make a very good, if not excellent musical, where such divas like Patti LuPone, Glenn Close, Betty Buckley, Elaine Page, Diahann Carroll and Leslie Uggams assumed Norma's turban. But in the annals of film history, there is only one Norma Desmond, and that is Gloria Swanson, who proved that she was not making a come-back here, simply a ""return"".",Sunset Blvd.
6,claudio_carvalho,A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece,10,18 January 2008,"In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched ""Sunset Boulevard"" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called ""Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back"" (a.k.a. ""The Making of Sunset Boulevard"" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Crepúsculo dos Deuses"" (""Dusk of the Gods"")",Sunset Blvd.
7,classicsoncall,"""No one ever leaves the Star, that's what makes one a Star.""",10,28 October 2006,"Watching the film I felt a little bit like William Holden, a bit out of place but fascinated by the intrigue and insanity of it all. There can be no doubt that the movie is one of the best of all time, it's stars feed off each other in a macabre dance, best exemplified by the makeshift New Year's Eve Party. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) spins an artful web for Joe Gillis (Holden), the spider and the fly in this case need each other in a symbiotic relationship that will ultimately lead to doom for both.The characters themselves almost seem larger than life, a particular line by Desmond confirms it. When Gillis first recognizes her as a former silent film star who used to be big, she replies - ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small"". That line lingers over the entire story the rest of the way, for a faded film queen with delusions of grandeur who can't recognize that her time is past. The card scene with Buster Keaton present adds further resonance to the masquerade, that was a great touch.Perhaps in a different way, Max von Mayerling's (Erich von Stroheim) story is just as compelling, the former husband turned butler who desperately trades loyalty for individuality. His time has also passed, but he manages to ride it out as nobly as he can. The finale when he takes over the direction of 'The Great Norma Desmond's' return is brilliantly conceived and movingly portrayed. Lights, camera, action, fade out - all smoke and mirrors where a fire once burned.It's interesting that ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""All About Eve"" came out the same year, each casting a wary eye at their respective venues, Hollywood and Broadway. Following recent viewings of both, I would have awarded the Best Film Oscar to 'Sunset', a much darker film at heart with greater irony. Though not totally overlooked, the film failed to capture any of the 'big' awards, having to settle for recognition in writing, scoring and art direction. A thought came to me as I watched Holden's character packing his bags in an attempt to flee the madness. Can you picture the film a quarter century later with the benefit of an Eagles soundtrack - ""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave"". Yes I know, it wouldn't have worked with the tone of the story, but the line fits. Oddly, this is so far the only movie I've seen with Gloria Swanson, and she was terrific. One couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, except perhaps Bette Davis, though she wouldn't have been in her fifties yet at the time of the picture. For his part, Holden displays just the right amount of angst in his role as the kept man, balancing an out of work career with the momentary hope of redemption that a successful screen play might bring. Both sizzle on screen, lending credibility to characters who can only arrive at disastrous outcomes, sort of long term contracts with no options.",Sunset Blvd.
8,gavin6942,"Could Be, In My Opinion, Wilder's Second Best Film",8,9 March 2010,"A writer (William Holden) has a car break down and he comes to the home of a silent film star. She is trying to write a script and ""hires"" him to ghost write it, keeping him a virtual prisoner... yet, she showers him with gifts. Is it love? ""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered a classic, a bit of romance, some noir, and a drama... it connects to the real world of Hollywood (director Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton make appearances) and adds a seedy side. Not too seedy, mind you... but there is some joking about the lead being a ""Black Dahlia suspect"". That such a gruesome case gets referenced in a movie taking place on a Paramount lot is a bit risqué, I think.The surprise star, aside from the obvious, is Milwaukee native Nancy Olson, who plays love interest Betty Schaefer (though whose love interest is a matter of dispute). She is quite beautiful, but never really became a big name (though she did make it into some notable Disney films).I suspect this film was an inspiration for Stephen King's ""Misery"" -- another writer held hostage story. King's has a bit more violence and torture, but the premise is similar. Take a dark plot and run it by King, it's bound to come out even darker... (""Misery"" starred James Caan and Kathy Bates, who actually won a Best Actress Oscar for her part!) Take Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece ""Double Indemnity"", lighten it up just a notch, make the plot more complex... and out comes ""Sunset Boulevard"". I daresay I preferred ""Double Indemnity"", but this may be a close second... though I have much more Wilder to go through before I can be truly sure!",Sunset Blvd.
9,lee_eisenberg,"I'm ready for my review, Mr. Wilder",10,16 May 2005,"We've seen many movies about Hollywood's emptiness, unseemliness, and other undesirable qualities. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is one of the best. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is a faded movie star in a relationship with reporter Joe Gillis (William Holden). Through his relationship with her, Joe not only sees Hollywood for what it really is, but he also comes to understand Norma for who she is.Billy Wilder always has a great story to tell, and this is no exception. The light/dark contrast in Norma's mansion could be a metaphor: Norma is an old movie star living in modern Hollywood. But as Norma reminds Joe: ""I'm still big. It's the pictures that got small."" Outstanding.Erich Von Stroheim also turns in an ample performance as Norma's servant.",Sunset Blvd.
10,jboothmillard,Sunset Boulevard,9,11 March 2011,"From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Bill Wilder (The Seven Year Itch, Some Like It Hot, The Apartment), this was a film I had heard about for a few year, and being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I definitely wanted to see it. Basically set in the 1950's Hollywood, movie screenplay writer Joe C. Gillis (Oscar nominated William Holden) narrates the story going to flashback that leads up to the murder seen at the beginning. Joe is struggling to get his work sold to any studios and has debts, and one night he ends up with his car getting a flat tyre and at the mansion of a former silent movie star on Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gloria Swanson) lives alone with butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Erich Von Stroheim), and has been doing so for many years since losing her popularity, becoming deluded and demented since, believing that one day she could return to the industry. Max being her ex-husband and former director who still has feelings for her is very protective of Norma, but she wants Joe to move in to the mansion to write a new screenplay for her to make her comeback, and in the process her becomes her lover and gigolo. Even though he is getting paid for doing this, he slowly starts feeling trapped, and seeking friendship he leaves one night to see Artie Green (Jack Webb), and he bumps into studio reader Betty Schaefer (Oscar nominated Nancy Olson). They quickly become attracted to each other, but Joe still returns Norma feeling some very warped sense of loyalty to the old actress, of course he still meets up with Betty to help her with her own script idea. By the time it seems the couple have fallen in love, Norma finds out and feels extremely jealous, she tries to sabotage whatever they have together. In the end Joe makes the hasty decision to threaten to leave the mansion, and that is when Norma really loses her mind and shoots him dead, so he has been narrating from beyond the grave, and with the press showing up about the murder her demented mind of fantasy thinks that she has made her longed after comeback. Also starring Fred Clark as Sheldrake, Lloyd Gough as Morino, The Ten Commandments director Cecil B. DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, Ray Evans, Jay Livingston and Sherlock Junior silent star Buster Keaton. Mostly all films about Hollywood before this were jolly and often musical, but this was the first to really show the cynicism and darker side, with fantastic acting, a witty script, and all the usual traits and tricks I have come to expect from a great film noir, a brilliant satirical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Franz Waxman and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Motion Picture Score, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Screenplay. ""I am big! It's the pictures that got small"" was number 24, and ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" Number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, the film was number 16 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was 52 on The 100 Greatest Films, it was number 16 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies and it was number 12 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!",Sunset Blvd.
11,ccthemovieman-1,Give It At Least Two Looks,8,23 December 2005,"On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too. This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again. Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim. He's amazing in this film. In supporting roles, I also enjoyed the wholesome Nancy Olsen and the young Jack Webb of ""Dragnet"" fame.This combination of drama-soap opera-film noir is one of the professional critics all-time favorite films. Odd how they love movies and Hollywood stars so much, yet relish films that tear them down, as this does.",Sunset Blvd.
12,rmax304823,Class Act,9,4 October 2002,"Spoilers. Sometimes lousy movies can be redeemed through means of a plenitude of epigrams sprinkled on the script. This one has all the classic tag lines. ""We had faces then."" ""I am still big; it's the pictures that got small."" ""Ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille."" ""The audience doesn't know that someone writes the words; they think the actors make them up as they go along."" And some lousy movies have little, barely noticeable touches that redeem them. Gillis storms out of Norma Desmond's house on New Years Eve after an argument, leaving his kept existence forever, but his long watch fob gets caught on the doorknob as he exits. (He'll be beck.) Norma visits a set on the Paramount lot for the first time in twenty years and, asked to sit and watch a rehearsal, the microphone on its boom brushes against her feathery hat and she shoves it away with irritation. And that last devastating dissolve.But this movie doesn't need that kind of redemption. The script -- the entire film -- is a classic that stands on its own two feet. Gloria Swanson's performance is overblown, as it should be. Von Stroheim -- or, let's call a spade a spade, plain Stroheim -- brings to his role the starchy oblige that he showed in ""Grand Illusion."" Holden will be remembered probably for three roles: ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" ""Picnic,"" and this. Brackett's script is well above average, even with its use of a voice-over, given by a dead man. Pat Olsen is mouth wateringly beautiful. She went on to make several other movies with Holden, none of them as good as this. The photography and art direction also stand out. This is one REALLY rotting mansion. Everything is out of date, from Buster Keaton to the tiny roach clip Norma Desmond wears on her finger when she smokes.Amid the bizarre melodrama there is one quiet, simple scene I always find appealing. Holden and Olsen are on a dark, deserted city street on Paramount's back lot, and she tells him she once had her nose fixed. He playfully leans down, examines it, and kisses it lightly. Then he backs away a few inches and warns her never to let him get closer than two feet. If he does, she should hit him with her shoe. Holden never indicates more than a momentary physical attraction, combined with a realization that he'd better not push the envelope. He later tells us he's ""crazy about her"" but we don't believe him. But in this effective and signal scene, Olsen's expression never changes. Her smile is sweet, agreeable, alert, and curious -- without in any way welcoming more intimacy. It all sounds rudimentary but it's tough to put this kind of exchange over and both performers do it splendidly. The story is elementary. Gillis, a failed screenwriter, is adopted by Norma Desmond, a rich but forgotten star of the silent days (""Oil wells in Bakersfield -- they keep pumping and pumping and pumping""), and he succumbs to greed, letting her buy him vicuna coats and ""evening clothes"" and whatever, in return for which he supplies the only thing she needs and he has to offer. But he doesn't do so without loathing himself. And when he falls for another girl, he decides to reject everything, Norma and girl friend and vicuna coat included, and go back to Dayton, Ohio. He doesn't make it. Everything about the story, Gillis's death included, is comic in a way, acerbic may be better, but very dark too. Wilder could be a phenomenally good director when the right script came his way, and this is an instance.",Sunset Blvd.
13,Tweekums,A classic that is still fresh almost seventy years on,10,24 December 2018,"This film opens with narrator, Joe Gillis, telling the viewer about a 'nobody' being found shot dead in the swimming pool of a once famous film star. We then move back six months and Gillis tells us about his own life. He is a hack screenwriter whose scripts are not in demand; he is behind on his rent and debt collectors want to repossess his car. One day he flees from these debt collectors and turns into the driveway of an apparently abandoned house on Sunset Boulevard. Of course it isn't abandoned; it is the home of fading star of the silent era Norma Desmond and her butler Max. It emerges that she is dreaming of a return and has written a script which he offers to polish, despite knowing it will never be anything other than terrible. Soon he has moved in and she is spending money on him... and he feels more and more trapped. As the story progresses the more tragic Norma appears.This is one of those classic films that one fears won't live up to its reputation but actually exceeds it. It manages to be both tragic and comic with its look at Hollywood's darker side. Norma Desmond is shown to have been one of the great stars of the silent era but now she is virtually forgotten by younger people and pitied by those who do remember her. She is clearly troubled when we meet her but by the end it is obvious that she is mad. Gloria Swanson is excellent in the role. Gillis is no less tragic a character; failing as a screenwriter, becoming a kept man in a claustrophobic environment and when he does appear to be finding real success and love it goes tragically wrong; William Holden captures this character perfectly. There are also fine performances from Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nancy Olsen as romantic interest Betty and Cecil B DeMille in an extended cameo as himself. Having DeMille playing himself could easily have broken the suspension of disbelief but in fact it adds to the feeling of realism. As well as being a good story it looks great; the shots of '50s Los Angeles are evocative of the era and the crumbling mansion perfectly mirrors how Norma's grip on reality is crumbling. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fans of classic cinema.",Sunset Blvd.
14,ma-cortes,A hack writer in search of refuge from creditors hides into a crumbling mansion inhabited by a faded silent movie star,8,16 September 2011,"This excellent movie with bitter-sweet style deal with a hack , bankrupt screenwriter who writes a screenplay for a former silent-film star who has faded into Hollywood obscurity . It starts in the surprising opening scene by having the flick related by a body floating face-down in a swimming pool . What follows in long flashback is pulls into an ancient mansion in which a writer in search of refuge from his creditors , as he shelters and becomes entangled in the web woven by a known but now forgotten star of the silent cinema , being submitted to humiliation and exploitation . The star named Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is high on hopes of a comeback and living in the past with her servant (Erich Von Stroheim). One of Wilder's finest and certainly the blackest and memorably sour of all Hollywood accounts of itself . Splendidly paced , the movie contains melodrama , acidity , bitterness , relentless indictment against Hollywood excesses , suitable sordid interpretations and precise direction . It's an over-the-top picture , though hampered by silly sub-plot related to sentimental triangle between William Holden, Nancy Olson and Jack Webb . Magnificent performances from William Holden as out-of-work gigolo-screenwriter who inextricably attaches himself to a faded possessive screen star ; Swanson is brilliant as the tragically deluded actress and realizes a real tour-de-force and of course superb Erich Von Stroheim as Norma Desmond's devotedly watchable butler . Likable appearing in brief card-game scenes from silent stars as H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton , furthermore Hedda Hooper and extraordinary intervention by Cecil B DeMille while filming some scenes of ¨Ten Commandments¨ with Henry Wilconson . This prestigious film deservedly won three Oscars , including best musical score by Franz Waxman , and best screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett . Awesome camera-work appropriately ¨Noir¨ by John Seitz .The picture is stunningly directed by Billy Wilder at his best . It belongs his first and better period during the 40s and 50s when realized sensational films as ¨Double indemnity¨, ¨Ace in the hole¨ , ¨Sabrina¨, ¨Stalag 17¨ and ¨Seven year itch¨ ; subsequently in the 60s and 70s he realized nice though unsuccessful movies as ¨Buddy buddy¨,¨Fedora¨ , ¨Front page¨and ¨Secret life of Sherlock Holmes¨. Rating : Above average , essential and indispensable watching ; harshly funny and riveting film and completely entertaining . It justly deserves its place among the best movies ever made .",Sunset Blvd.
15,moonspinner55,The ghosts of Hollywood's ravaged past...,7,28 August 2005,"Hack screenwriter chances upon mansion of a faded Hollywood silent screen star who 'hires' him to ghost-write her return project ""Salome"", but who really wants him for her lover. Poor Norma Desmond: she's 50 years old and over the hill! Literate, but queasy black comedy has a great script and majestic performances, but creeps its way to the depressingly inevitable. The palpable aroma of vintage cigarettes and the smell of rosy perfume hanging in the air permeates this incredible Billy Wilder film; yet, the deeper it crawls into its dark corner, the more repulsive it all seems. It can easily be called a masterpiece, but is it an entertaining movie? Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made.

16,dbdumonteil,Greatness Boulevard.,10,7 August 2001,"Generally considered as Wilder's peak,it lives up to its reputation.Fifty years later,it remains the best movie about movie world,not only hollywoodian .One hundred times plagiarized,never surpassed. First of all,there 's the Swanson/Von Stroheim couple.He directed her in the famous ""Queen Kelly""(another must of the silent movies).Von Stroheim was too ahead of his time,his movies scared the censors ,so he was not allowed to pursue a career that would have been stunning in the talkies.Here he became (supreme downfall),Swanson's butler ,while we see one of his former colleagues,Cecil B. De Mille,playing his own role,still directing.Von Stroheim's character is called ""Max von Mayerling"" ,probably one of Wilder's private jokes: Stroheim once said he was the son of a lady in waiting of Austrian Empress Elisabeth (Sissi) whose son Rudolph committed suicide in Mayerling!And Wilder was Austrian too. Swanson is impressive too.The comeback myth is the dream of every actor whose star is slowly but inexorably fading.that she continues viewing her old -and real!- triumphs like ""Queen Kelly,that she's writing an extravaganza shows that her comeback desire has reached the point of no return and that her only place in this world is the asylum.What Swanson did not achieve in the movie,she did it for real:she really could come back(as Lilian Gish),her performance,particularly in the last scene ,has stood the test of time. Wilder as a scriptwriter outdoes himself here;lines like ""I'm still big;it's the pictures that got small"" could be pronounced today ! 25 years later,he would try to update ""sunset blvd"" with ""Fedora"":the latter suffered by comparison,but it's a very worthwhile work that every fan of this great director should see.",Sunset Blvd.
17,blanche-2,The ultimate has-been in the ultimate Hollywood story,10,26 June 2007,"William Holden is Joe Gillis, a down and out screenwriter trying to keep his car from being repossessed in ""Sunset Boulevard,"" a 1950 film written and directed by Billy Wilder. The film stars Gloria Swanson, Max von Stroheim, Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, and Cecil B. Demille. Gillis hides his car in a garage, not realizing it is the home of the great silent film star, the delusional Norma Desmond (Swanson), who lives in this enormous mansion, cared for by her butler (von Stroheim). Finding out he is a screenwriter, Norma solicits his help in editing her script of ""Salome,"" her comeback film. Feeling somewhat trapped at first, Joe eventually enjoys the good life. When he slips away to be with his friends on New Year's Eve, his friend's fiancée, Betty Schaefer (Olson) suggests a screenplay based on a story written by Joe. (The story actually was a script by Wilder, filmed in Germany.) He returns to the Sunset Boulevard mansion to learn that Norma, distraught over his leaving, has attempted suicide. Taking pity on her, Joe becomes her lover and moves from the garage into the big house. Meanwhile, he's falling for Betty and slipping away to work with her at night.This is perhaps the greatest Hollywood story, and yet it didn't get off to a very good start. The first scene took place in a morgue, where the dead bodies talked to one another. At the first screening, the audience laughed, which they weren't supposed to be doing. As Wilder sat on the steps outside, a woman walked out and, unaware of who he was, said, ""Have you ever seen such ?x@//*&?"" ""And we had worked on it for a year,"" Wilder told an interviewer. So the opening was cut.Wilder captures the ego and delusional aspects of Desmond perfectly, a woman caught in the past who has lost all sense of reality. This role provided silent film star Gloria Swanson with her great comeback. With her royal demeanor, sharp voice and gorgeous eyes, Swanson actually plays the role like a silent star, in a very overt way. The truth is, Norma never left not only her stardom, but her film roles. At the time of the filming, Swanson was 52 playing a has-been of 50. By today's standards, it's somewhat amusing, and you'd probably add 20 years if you were doing it today. In fact, in the Broadway show, the line ""There's nothing wrong with being 50"" was cut. Wilder approached Mae West, Pola Negri and Mary Pickford for Norma before Swanson.""Sunset Boulevard"" may have given Swanson her comeback, but it made William Holden a superstar. After his starring role in ""Golden Boy,"" Holden disappeared into light films and basically went nowhere until Joe Gillis. He is remembered today as one of the great stars of the '50s, yet he was of the same generation as many of the stars of the '30s and '40s. He is glorious looking - you wouldn't have to be a loony tune to lock him up in your house. He plays the role with the right touch of cynicism and self-hatred. Montgomery Clift was set to play this role but dropped out. He, too, would have been excellent but probably not as hard-hitting. von Stroheim, as Norma's protector and butler Max, is perfection. In real life, he couldn't drive, so the car needed to be towed; in the scene where he drives up to Paramount, he actually crashed through the gates.In the film, Norma, thinking that Demille wants her for a role, goes to Paramount and visits him on the set of ""Samson and Delilah,"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" uses the real filming of that movie and its cast.As a Broadway show, ""Sunset Boulevard"" was opulent but much less effective. There wasn't enough music (the second act had one new song) but provided a tremendous showcase and two great numbers for the various women who played Norma. Stephen Sondheim had at one time entertained doing this as a musical; in his hands, it would have captured the dark atmosphere of the film much better.Billy Wilder gives us a biting portrait of actors who live for nothing but their stardom, their hangers-on for whom they are just a meal ticket, and the sadness of being aged and forgotten in Hollywood. A great classic starring the greats, written and directed by one. It doesn't get any better than this.",Sunset Blvd.
18,Quinoa1984,"arguably Wilder at his very best; Swanson, Holden, and von Stroheim are about perfect",10,25 August 2005,"I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd. I had an idea of what to expect, but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp, so artistically compelling, and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor. In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"" was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator, Joe Gillis, who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood. Fate, or maybe just odd luck, pits him into the driveway of a big, almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight. He meets Norma Desmond, whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star. ""I am big,"" she says in one of her trademark lines, ""it's the pictures that have gotten small."" She confides in Gillis, after he tells her who he is and why he's there (hiding out as it were), that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her 'comeback'. He very reluctantly agrees to do it, and very soon gets sucked up into her world, becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends. But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the ""end scene at the beginning"", and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character. And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird. I can't wait to see it again.",Sunset Blvd.
19,edwagreen,Sun Never Sets on this Boulevard ***1/2,9,22 January 2006,"Billy Wilder's memorable dramatic film, ""Sunset Boulevard,"" was made in 1950.The lead role of Norma Desmond, a washed-up actress, had first been offered to actresses Pola Negri and Norma Shearer before landing in the capable hands of Gloria Swanson. This film heralded the return to the screen by Miss Swanson after many years. It was well worth the wait.Swanson, as Desmond, evokes fear and emotion-complex but yet believable to the audience. A has been actress, who dreams of a comeback, she is mystified by the appearance of William Holden, an apparent gigolo, who made a wrong turn with his car and entered the Desmond world.Norma is needy and emotionally ill. Her butler, played by the excellent Erich Von Stroheim, admits to Holden, that he had been married to Desmond years before. Though the marriage had faltered, he remained to tend to her needs. He even sends her cards with the names of her adoring public-in reality long since gone.Like a magnet, Desmond is attracted and immediately attached to the Holden character. When he ultimately attempts to leave her, she shoots him dead and acts as if this was part of a scene in one of her films. Completely off by film's end, she tells Cecil B. De Mille that she is ready for her take.Be ready for a tale of misfortune, of great acting performances and an attempt to understand the human psyche.",Sunset Blvd.

21,sunwarrior13,A Classic Movie About Hollywood,10,27 February 2012,"Sunset Boulevard,also known as Sunset Blvd., is a film noir directed and co-written by Billy Wilder, and produced and co-written by Charles Brackett. It was named after the boulevard that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills, California.The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, a faded silent movie star who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen with Erich von Stroheim as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and ex-husband. Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Lloyd Gough and Jack Webb play supporting roles. Director Cecil B. DeMille and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper play themselves, and the film includes cameo appearances by leading silent film actors Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson.The story begins at the end as the body of Joe Gillis is fished out of a Hollywood swimming pool. From The Great Beyond, Joe details the circumstances of his untimely demise. Hotly pursued by repo men, impoverished, indebted ""boy wonder"" screenwriter Gillis ducks into the garage of an apparently abandoned Sunset Boulevard mansion. Wandering into the spooky place, Joe encounters its owner, imperious silent star Norma Desmond. Upon learning Joe's profession, Norma inveigles him into helping her with a comeback script that she's been working on for years. Joe realizes that the script is hopeless, but the money is good and he has nowhere else to go. Soon the cynical and opportunistic Joe becomes Norma's kept man. While they continue collaborating, Norma's loyal and protective chauffeur Max Von Mayerling contemptuously watches from a distance. More melodramatic than funny, the screenplay by Wilder and Charles Brackett began life as a comedy about a has-been silent movie actress and the ambitious screenwriter who leeches off her. Sunset Boulevard ranks among the most scathing satires of Hollywood and the cruel fickleness of movie fandom for it is a tremendously entertaining combination of noir, black comedy, and character study.Aside from that,it tears away at the curtain that keeps reality away from fiction.Indeed,it is classic movie that tries to portray what Hollywood is all about.",Sunset Blvd.
22,jotix100,"""Mr. Wilder, I'm ready for my close-up""",10,29 August 2005,"Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. ""Sunset Boulevard"" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the ""talkies"" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard"".",Sunset Blvd.
23,Doylenf,"Says Holden: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway...""",9,28 August 2005,"WILLIAM HOLDEN really hits his stride in the role of Joe Gillis, the down-on-his-heels writer who just happens to be drowning in debt before he comes upon a secluded and decaying mansion that is about to change his life. Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: ""I sure drove into an interesting driveway"" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: ""It's the pictures that got small."" With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says: ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille"", it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.",Sunset Blvd.
24,preppy-3,A true Hollywood horror story,10,15 March 2008,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical.

26,writers_reign,Beyond Sunset,10,13 November 2005,"Although I long ago taped every Billy Wilder movie off TV I can't resist seeing them again on the Big Screen as part of the Wilder retrospective running at the NFT in November and December. Every movie Wilder wrote and directed was on the Great side of Good but seeing all the titles in print in a brochure reinforces just how many GREAT movies he made. Somehow he contrived to make two back to back just as the forties gave way to the fifties and then damned if he didn't do the very same thing as the fifties in turn became the sixties. The first two were Ace In The Hole and Sunset Boulevard, the second Some Like It Hot and The Apartment and I've yet to mention Double Indemnity (only his THIRD At Bat as a writer-director in America), The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, A Foreign Affair, One, Two, Three, etc. If ever a film NOT made by Orson Welles had 'masterpiece' written all over it Sunset Boulevard is that movie. Every frame is touched with genius and in this film Wilder elevates Biting The Hand That Feeds You to an Art Form. Everyone and his Uncle Max knows by now the story of how third-rate writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) fetches up in the Gothic manse of has-been Screen Goddess Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and winds up as a gigolo and ultimately a dead gigolo but over and above the storyline it is the 'touches' that make this so great both in dialogue (Betty: How've you been keeping yourself lately? Joe: Actually I haven't been keeping myself lately) and visuals: Norma Desmond represents a bygone era and ironically it is Cecil B DeMille (playing himself) who tells Norma how far pictures have progressed and is THEN revealed to be directing wearing the riding breeches which were de riguer for movie directors IN THE SILENT ERA, a wonderful, typical and classic Wilder statement. It would be superfluous to merely repeat what other posters have said here but we can never repeat the word Masterpiece too often in connection with this movie.",Sunset Blvd.

These pictures particularly show the dark and downsides of this strange world of its own. This movie is full with references to Hollywood, as it's a story about a fading star from the silent era who meets up with a young struggling script writer.The movie has a quite interesting story, that builds on its great characters. It's a greatly cast movie, that features Gloria Swanson, an actress who more or less gloriously plays herself in this movie. She herself was an actress during the silent movie era and actually hadn't appeared in any movie for 9 years before singing on for this movie. The movie is filled with some casting like this. For instance Erich von Stroheim plays a once great director and Cecil B. DeMille appears as himself in this movie, in a quite big talking role. It's also the movie the well known line 'All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up' comes from The movie truly benefited from its great and smart casting.It's a real character driven movie, in which more and more becomes obvious about the female lead, who is slowing loosing her mind and sense of reality because she is in full denial about her fading career and glamorous stardom. Its mostly were the movie its drama is coming from, though of course there is a whole lot more going in this movie. The writer William Holden also has his own issues and there are a bunch of more different story-lines and characters that the movie involves.It's really pleasant that this movie is a fast going one. Unlike many other movies from the same time period this movie rarely has slow or dull moment in it. Yes, it's a drama but it's one of those dramatic movies that also still is really pleasant to watch.It's simply a really done well movie. It had a a great story to work with but having a good story is of course one thing, having a great movie is a totally different thing. It's no big wonder that this movie worked out so great, since it had Billy Wilder at the helm of it. He does not only tell the story great and with lots of pace but also makes the movie with a lot of eye for detail. It's also a movie with some good looking sets and costumes for instance, though initially these are not really the things you will notice first.A great movie about Hollywood done by some of Hollywood's biggest.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Sunset Blvd.
30,evanston_dad,One of the Few Perfect Movies in Existence,10,30 May 2006,"On the one hand, it seems pointless to add yet one more comment to the numerous comments already here testifying to the greatness of this film, but I love this movie so much that it seems just wrong to not have it included in my index of reviews.There are only a few movies I've seen that I would be tempted to label perfect. ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is one. ""Taxi Driver"" is another. These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned. Add ""Sunset Boulevard"" to that list.""Boulevard"" represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish, but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining (and even quite funny at times) rather than unbearably depressing.There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill, and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark, film-noirish exterior. I think that ultimately ""Sunset Boulevard"" is about the love of movies. You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond, played brilliantly (and I don't toss that word around lightly) by Gloria Swanson. But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business, and that's what he sets out to expose in his film. Movies get made and stars are born, but for every birth there's a death.I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself. If you allow yourself to think about it too long, Wilder's use of her is almost cruel, as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress. The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way--it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause. But the film stops just short of cruelty, because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film, and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved, and who can't relate to that? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one. But I don't think it is an easy role. Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma--he's the moral conscience of the film, and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp.There are so many quotable lines in this film, I don't know where to begin. Imagine this film and ""All About Eve"" coming out in the same year. It's a movie quote fan's wet dream.In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia, apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film, starring herself. (She might even have gotten as far as completing it). Of course nothing ever came of it, and Swanson sunk quickly back into obscurity. But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear, courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film.Grade: A+",Sunset Blvd.
31,AlsExGal,A popular opinion is to believe Joe is a cad BUT...,10,3 September 2021,"... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves, but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio, and his pride wouldn't let him. Also, some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman, but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer, the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. To me this is a perfect film.",Sunset Blvd.

As luck would have it, however, while trying to elude some men attempting to repossess his automobile a flat tire causes him to drive into what he thinks is an abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Once there he is met by an elderly man named ""Max Von Mayerling"" (Erich von Stroheim) who motions for him to come into the house as the owner wishes to see immediately. It's then that he meets a former silent movie actress by the name of ""Norma Desmond"" (Gloria Swanson) who mistakes him for a funeral director called upon to bury a pet. Once the error is corrected she informs him that she has a script for a movie she has been working on and would like his professional opinion on it as she is planning on returning to the movie business to reclaim her former glory. Although he accepts her eventual offer of employment what Joe doesn't tell her is that the film industry has long since evolved and she simply doesn't have the talent necessary for such a return. What Joe doesn't understand is the danger associated with her mental and emotional instability during this particular time. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining drama which benefited from good performances by all involved. I especially like the haunting ending which Gloria Swanson delivered with such eerie precision and I recommend it for those interested in a film of this type. Above average.",Sunset Blvd.

Narrated by William Holden who is sheltered at her mansion in return for a screenplay that will resurrect her. Intriguing setup rich in dialogue and plot turns that result in the ultimate revelation in the conclusion. Billy Wilder does an excellent job at presenting ill fate Hollywood careers due to technology. Wilder previously made an entirely different film called Double Indemnity and both share a common theme of dominating femme figure. Swanson delivers a riveting performance of a woman illusion to total madness. Holden feels his talent trapped and seeks escape through an outside project. Erich von Stroheim is the ex-husband who lives to revive her past. He will be instrumental in assisting her concluding performance and famous last words. Nancy Olson plays a screenwriter unable to unlock Holden's thoughts. She is engaged yet will face Holden's forced lifestyle in blunt terms. Great cameo performances by film personalities portraying themselves, including famed director Cecil B. DeMille. It is the dark side of show business where stars flicker no more.

34,HotToastyRag,The role of a lifetime,3,12 November 2018,"""Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup,"" is the oft-misquoted line from Sunset Boulevard, one of the greatest Oscar-baits in history. An aging silent movie actress lives reclusively in her Sunset Boulevard mansion and dwells on her past fame instead of her ability to adjust to the modern era. A young hopeful screenwriter crosses her path and she becomes obsessed with the idea of a comeback. Wouldn't every actress over the age of forty kill for that part, knowing they'd probably reserve the Best Actress Oscar in 1951? Well, Pola Negri, Norma Shearer, Mary Pickford, Mae West, and my personal preference, Greta Garbo, all refused the part. Anyone who knows their history knows that Gloria Swanson didn't win her Oscar in 1951; she was beaten out by the ridiculous Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday.Part of Sunset Boulevard that tugs at the audience's heartstrings is the similarities between Gloria Swanson's career and the plot points written for her character, Norma Desmond. Gloria was a silent movie star who worked prolifically for Paramount Studios; Norma has a line of dialogue: ""Without me, there would be no Paramount."" Gloria's career tapered off when sound pictures became popular, as did Norma's. Many of Gloria's silent movies were directed by Erich von Stoheim; in Sunset Boulevard, Eric plays Norma's devoted butler who believes she's the ""greatest star of all"". If you find all those connections heartwarming, you'll probably like this movie.All the other parts of Sunset Boulevard, the ones that don't tug on the audience's heartstrings, make me dislike the movie. First off, the opening scene is one of the worst opening scenes in any old movie I've ever seen! The beginning ruins the entire story, and there's no way the audience can forget what's just been spoiled. If by some miracle you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and fast-forward the first five minutes.I'm not a William Holden fan, so I would have preferred Montgomery Clift, who was actually signed on for the part, and whom I like very much. Fred MacMurray, another choice during casting, would have also been great, since he mastered the ""voice-over"" film noir technique years earlier. All the scenes of Bill by himself or with his love interest, the forgettable Nancy Olson, feel like a B-picture. The first few times I saw this movie, my mind had tried to help me by forgetting William Holden was even in it; I was continually disappointed to watch him in the vast majority of the film.This one's a classic, so if you're an old movie buff, you can't really get away with skipping this one. Don't feel bad if it doesn't become your favorite, though; you're not alone. I don't really like this one and feel the connection Gloria Swanson had to her character elevated it to Classic status. She may have won the ""part of a lifetime"" but in my opinion, many, many other actresses could have given an equally effective performance.",Sunset Blvd.
35,AaronCapenBanner,Told From The Grave.,7,2 November 2013,"Billy Wilder directed this dark comedy/drama that stars William Holden as hack writer Joe Gillis, desperate for work who agrees to see former silent movie queen Norma Desmond(played by Gloria Swanson) who has dreams of a big comeback in a picture directed by Cecil B. Demille,and wants Joe to write it, but in reality has become a delusional, even insane woman who lives in a self-contained world in her Hollywood home with her butler,and former director & husband, Max(played by Erich Von Stroheim) who remains steadfastly loyal. Joe and Norma start a relationship(she is still wealthy) but her jealousies grow out of hand leading to the inevitable outcome... Nancy Olsen and Jack Webb play Joe's concerned friends. Legendary film has many interesting and accurate things to say about that self-contained world called Hollywood, though only quibble is that this film is a little too out there, to the point it affects credibility by becoming a self-parody. Still, a witty and memorable film regardless.",Sunset Blvd.
36,FlashCallahan,Those wonderful people out there in the dark......,9,26 July 2015,"Obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis isn't able to sell his work to the studios, full of debt and thinking of returning to his hometown to live a mundane life. While trying to evade his creditors, he gets a flat tire and parks in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond, who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max. Norma appears slightly deluded and believes she will return to the silver screen, and is isolated from the world by Max, who was her director and husband for a while. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her write a screenplay for her comeback and inadvertently becomes her lover. When Joe falls in love with up and coming writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and and her madness leads to an underlying meltdown.....When the term 'they don't make them like this anymore' this is one of those films that easily fits into that paraphrase. The film has two narrative structures throughout, and they fall into two genres, Film Noir, and Psychological thriller.To be once the biggest star, and then to fall into obscurity must be every celebrities nightmare, so this film must be the perfect horror film for all stars who grace the titular location. For Norma, her wealth and her belongings are her prison, because no matter hoe delusional she appears to be, she knows that outside in the real world, she is long forgotten in Hollywood, and age is definitely one on her side.So Joe is like a breath if fresh air to her, and reignites her obsession for stardom, and in many respects, her obsession with Joe, which leads to the Film Noir element of the story.Swanson and Holden are spectacular, but Swanson, her on screen breakdown is a revelation, and the final third of the movie is as haunting and as harrowing as to what is going on in Norma's head when she is alone.It's a landmark movie, deserved of all its plaudits and fans, and it's a stern warning to anyone who is thinking about a career in Hollywood, the paves maybe paved with gold, but you are risking rats in your pool.Essential cinema in every way possible.",Sunset Blvd.

Until Joe Gillis, a washed-up screenwriter, accidentally stumbles upon the scene mistaken for an undertaker. There are some humorous moments like who the coffin was for in the beginning. William Holden played the Joe Gillis role. Erich Von Stroheim played butler, Max and sweet Nancy Olson played Betty Schaefer. The story begins with Joe's death and he narrates his story about six months before his death about when things were collapsing around him financially. He was desperate just like Norma Desmond. Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is legendary role up there with Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara and Blanche DuBois. The film is a sweeping black and white classic with unforgettable moments of desperation and acting performances. I think this is one of Billy Wilder's best films of his career.",Sunset Blvd.

This is a well-written movie about the dark side of Hollywood; a failed screenwriter down to his last dime and a movie queen has-been in denial, both pinning their hopes on each other. It's a hard movie, extremely cynical and very sad. But also sincerely gripping until the very end (even though the ending is shown in the opening shots.

40,christopher-underwood,I thought I was in for a real treat,7,26 September 2017,"As I unwrapped my Blu-ray to re-watch this old favourite I thought I was in for a real treat. Perhaps I should not have watched it so soon after seeing Aronofsky's mother! That film is full of terrifying emotions and selfish actions supposedly in the service of selflessness. And here, something not altogether different but so mannered, so other worldly. The beginning is great, all mystery and ambiguity, the scene where we visit Paramount Studios and meet the real Cecil B DeMille directing while a spotlight is turned upon our crazy heroine is fantastic. But so much of this is mundane and repetitive. I understand Mae West was considered for the role and at first I thought, what nonsense, but on reflection perhaps playing this for laughs would have been preferable to this arch campiness. Holden is fine, not someone with much charisma, and I've certainly seen him better. What he lacks here is any sense that this is really going on. I know in 1950 a bed scene between the two would probably have been too much (though goodness knows there were enough film folk of maturity bedding nymphets at the time) but maybe just an unmade bed or something to indicate he had some connection with this wretched creature.",Sunset Blvd.

William Holden(Joe Gillis) ""Picnic""'55 I had seen before in other films.  Gloria Swanson (Norma Desmond) ""Airport""'75 kept me wondering why she was so attracted to Joe Gillis, who could have been her grandson in this picture.  After seeing Erich von Stroheim (Max von Mayerling) ""The Mask of Dijon"" '46 who gave a very strange performance as a butler, housekeeper and who was madly in love with Norma Desmond along with acting like a Nazi and her personal film director. I just wondered how the story was going to turn out in the end. Billy Wilder brought back to the screen in 1950, great Silent film stars with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who was an assistant director to D.W. Griffith, ""Birth of a Nation"".  Gloria Swanson was a famous actress and after this film, her career took off once again, with Films, Television and many business ventures.   When Billy Wilder made pictures, they all became great CLASSICS for all generations to view and enjoy.",Sunset Blvd.
42,JamesHitchcock,Can a man touch pitch and not be defiled?,9,11 September 2014,"Hollywood has been making films about itself almost as long as there has been a Hollywood to make films about, but there were three very fine examples in the early fifties, ""Sunset Boulevard"" from 1950 and ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" from two years later. It has been suggested that both ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" were based upon the career of Norma Talmadge, a major star of the silent era in the twenties who (like Lina Lamont in ""Singin' in the Rain"") found it difficult to adapt to the coming of sound because of a strong working-class accent. Talmadge was still alive in the early fifties, and I often wonder what she must have made of these two films. Unlike ""Singin' in the Rain"", a Technicolor period piece set in the twenties, ""Sunset Boulevard"" has a contemporary setting and was shot in an expressionistic black-and-white reminiscent of film noir. (Director Billy Wilder had earlier made one of the great classic noirs, ""Double Indemnity""). During the early fifties many of the stars of the silent era were still alive and living in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, and were still fondly remembered by the older generation, but were no longer the celebrities they had been at the height of their fame and were little-known to younger people. The film deals with one of these, Norma Desmond, a faded silent diva whose career, like Talmadge's, came to an abrupt end with the coming of the ""talkies"". Norma has retained considerable wealth from her days as a star but has become a lonely recluse, living in her vast mansion with no company but her German servant Max. She still receives quantities of fan mail, and harbours dreams of making a triumphant comeback; she is writing a screenplay based upon the story of Salome and John the Baptist and hopes that it will be made into a film by her old friend Cecil B. DeMille with herself as the star. The other main character in the film is Joe Gillis, an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. When we first meet Joe he is floating face down, quite dead, in Norma's swimming pool. We then discover in an extended flashback how he met Norma by chance, was recruited to assist with her ""Salome"" screenplay, became her lover and eventually ended up in that swimming pool. A subplot deals with Joe's relationship with his friend Artie Green and Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer, a studio script reader with ambitions to become a script writer. The script for ""Sunset Boulevard"" was co-written by Wilder and his producer Charles Brackett, and it is a fine one. There is a streak of sardonic humour running through it, although it is not really a comedy (unless, perhaps, a very black one). The main themes are self-delusion and the traps of fame. Norma, in the teeth of all the evidence, persuades herself that she is still a star, that the ""talkies"" are just a passing fad and that the public are longing for the great Norma Desmond to make her comeback in a silent film. She also convinces herself that Joe is in love with her, while it is clear that he is just using her for her money. Although Joe sees the truth about Norma all too clearly, he has fallen prey to a delusion of a different kind, namely that he can touch pitch and not be defiled. He thinks that he can exploit Norma shamelessly, that he can carry on an underhand affair with Betty while remaining friends with Artie, and that in spite of everything he can still retain his spiritual and artistic integrity. He thinks that he can succeed in the Hollywood system without needing to make the necessary compromises with reality. Norma never wakes from her dreams, eventually spiralling downhill into madness, but Joe eventually realises that he cannot have it all, that he cannot have Norma, and Betty, and his writing career. Shortly before his death he resolves to renounce them all and to return to his old job as a journalist in Ohio. His moment of lucidity costs him his life, but it enables him to regain his self-respect. This was an ambitious theme for a movie, but Wilder found two actors equal to the task in Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Swanson herself had been a major silent star whose career had waned with the coming of sound and who saw in ""Sunset Boulevard"" her chance of making a return to the screen. (Her last feature film had been nine years earlier). Today this is probably the role for which she is best remembered. As for the much younger Holden, this was the film which made him a major star. There is another good performance from Erich von Stroheim as Max, who at first seems a sinister figure but is later shown to be a devoted servant with a secret of his own. When the film came out, it was popular with the public and acclaimed by the critics, but Louis B Mayer publicly berated Wilder for biting the hand that fed him by satirising the industry that had made him famous. These sentiments were by no means universal in the film world; several figures from the industry, notably DeMille, agreed to appear in cameos as themselves. I do wonder, however, if feelings similar to Meyer's were responsible for the film's relatively poor showing at the Oscars compared to its main rival, ""All about Eve"". That film, of course, is also about an ageing actress, but is set in the world of the theatre, not the cinema. Far safer to satirise Broadway than Hollywood. Today, however, both films have taken their rightful place among the classics of the cinema. 9/10",Sunset Blvd.

46,lasttimeisaw,Wilder's best!,9,8 October 2014,"Billy Wilder's paramount triumph of film-noir melodrama, piercing through the Hollywood industry's utter callousness and an over-the-hill silent era actress' poignant illusion of a comeback to garner the spotlight. The film begins like DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10), our ill-fated protagonist Joe Gills (Holden), a 30 something hack writer for the Hollywood studio, narrates beyond his grave to reveal the tragedy ending - as shown in a majestic shot from the angle of the bottom of a swimming pool (a trick done by putting a mirror in the bottom and shot from its reflection), a man's body is floating on the water, facing down, and for sharp eyes, it is obviously Joe himself. So while the voice-over gravely chronicles his story of the last months of his life, on screen, audience is gravitated by the parallel presence of the unwitting Joe, from his down-and-out predicament, till he accidentally runs into Norma Desmond's (Swanson) dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard, on the day of her pet chimp's funeral. The metaphor of Joe's destiny is too apparent to overlook, being a substitute of the lonely but opulent has-been's companion, until his own doom. Wilder and his co-writers cook up a perfect match for the duo, Norma has penned her own script of Salome and is desirous of launching her comeback with Cecil B. DeMille in the Paramount lot. So she is in urgent need of a writer to revise her dilettantish work, and Joe, just reaches the end of his tether to survive in the showbiz, it realistically starts off as a win-win deal for both, until when Joe realizes what Norma needs is more than just a writer and what is more satirically, he is not a competent ghost writer, the output of Salome's script is a dud, Paramount has no intention to produce the picture at all, although indulging a 50-year-old to star as Salome is too idiosyncratic to begin with. So Joe caves in as a reluctant gigolo for Norma and she falls for him inevitably, her suffocating dominance is normally compensated by her gratification of material luxury. Naturally Joe is struggling, the reality is too hard to refuse, but internally he despises of his degeneration. It is a moral dilemma, so there must be a vent somewhere, when he meets Betty Schaefer (Olson), a young and inspiring fellow writer, age 22, the time with her becomes his safe haven, even his writer's block is dismantled, they contribute wonderful ideas for a new script of a romance. Unfortunately Norma will never let him go, the tricky part is, Joe is never completely heartless to her, on the first notice of her suicidal attempt at the New Year's Eve, he rushes back to her bed immediately and they reconcile romantically. We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved. Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line. Swanson is not the only one carry an autobiographic curve in the story, so is Erich von Stroheim, as Max, her dour but loyal butler-cum-chauffeur, the only one takes care of her in the decadent manor, more shockingly is later he reveals to be Norma's first husband and the director who has brought her to stardom and accompanies her into obsolescence. In real life Mr. von Stroheim and Ms. Swanson both suffered a career debacle after their collaboration in QUEEN KELLY (1929).SUNSET BLVD. is also a breakthrough for Holden, not entirely overshadowed by Swanson's supremacy, his Joe is a tale of woe himself, his final severance from Betty by willfully divulging his toy boy identity is handled equally with weighty melancholy and beautiful delivery; as for Olson, she bespeaks the common guidance as a young man's pursuit, all four main actors acquire Oscar nominations, but only hers is lingering on unworthiness.In a nutshell, the film deserves its iconic prestige and is deservingly one of Wilder's most accomplished films among his cannon (alongside SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959, 9/10).",Sunset Blvd.

We get the story from Gillis himself, in an emotionless and disembodied voice, as he recounts the series of events that happened to him that eventually put him there.Gillis had hit hard times and was about to lose his car, a 1946 Plymouth Convertible, to his creditors. Trying like hell to get the $290.00 to keep the car Gillis came up short and decided to skip town ,with the car, until the heat blows over or he somehow got the cash to pay off the car loan. It's then almost by accident that Gillis got involved with legendary silent film star Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson, in who's mansion garage he ditched his disabled, from a flat tire, Plymouth. Norma together with her loyal butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim), whom we later finds out was her first husband, mistakes Gillis for the man form the City Health Department or ASPCA guy who was called to take her dear departed pet chimpanzee away for burial. It's when Norma finds out that Gillis is a Hollywood screenwriter she dreams up plans in her delusional mind for him to write her a role that she can make her long awaited comeback, or return as Norma calls it, to the silver screen.Grateful at first to Norma for giving him a place to stay Gillis works night and day in coming up with a screenplay worthy of her long awaited return to the movies. As things soon turn out it's only Norma, not her many millions of adoring fans, who's the only one who's enthusiastic about her long awaited return to films and no one else! It soon gets to Gillis to just how unstable Norma is in that he tries to keep the truth from her that's she's, at 50, too old and over the hill to play the parts that made her the Hollywood legend that she's become. While all this is going on Norma becomes very attached to Gillis in him feeding her all this hogwash, just to keep her from cracking up, in how great her forthcoming movie, that's if any studio is willing to finance it, is going to be with her in the staring role of ""Salome the Dancing Temptress.""As things soon turn out it's Norma who becomes desperately dependent on Gillis not the other way around in needing him to keep her company in her spacious mansion, that has eight master bedrooms, and even become her lover! That with ex-husband Max making sure that Norma's living in the fantasy world that she conjured up for herself over the years! Gillis just about had enough of Norma's antics when his new found girlfriend Betty, Nancy Olsen, who just happens to be his best friend's Artie, Jack Webb, fiancée found out about his strange relationship with her and walked out on him. Packing his bags and leaving Norma for good Gillis never realized how far Norma would go to keep him until it was too late! It was that fatal decision on Gillis' part that landed him in Norma's swimming pool where we first saw him at the beginning of he movie!Unforgettable climax with Norma now completely out of her mind acting as if she's doing her big scene, close-up and all, in her favorite director C.B DeMile's latest motion picture. That was the only way that Norma's now distraught butler and ex-husband Max could coax her into turning herself over to the police for the murder of her good friend and house-mate the luckless and now gone forever Joseph Gillis!",Sunset Blvd.
48,theowinthrop,"Alright Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.",10,10 September 2005,"It is among the best and most tragic exit lines in film. And it also leads directly to the best conclusion (I feel) in movies in terms of proper cinematography: the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness. Rarely does a film end so satisfactorily and perfectly.SUNSET BLVD. was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame. A STAR IS BORN had done so in the in 1937. It showed how as a star is nurtured by the system to great fame, another prominent star descends into oblivion and death. So why (if the story theme was not new) was SUNSET BLVD. such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950? It boiled down to this: the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main (although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance). Norman had always had a drinking problem which he never controlled. Norma was not into that - she was always into a healthy physical lifestyle (except for smoking), but the effect of her publicity and the fan mail pushed her egomania to great heights. It made her so egocentric that she can only think of the people around her in her immediate cycle as the greatest representatives of all those millions of unseen fans - the wonderful people out there in the dark. They are there for her adoration only. Norman Main, in comparison, did find a measure of happiness in Vicki Lester, whom he discovered and helped to find her true potential. He was more selfless, to the point (as it turned out) of self-destruction. Not really like Norma Desmond. To her people are there to serve Gods and Goddesses called stars.One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester. Joe and Vicki were both ambitious, but Joe really wasn't as interested in Norma (aside from giving him room, board, and a temporary job), as Vicki was in Norman. There was a mutual attraction there (Norman was not incredibly older than Vicki, as opposed to Norma's older age compared to Joe's). Joe also had his girlfriend/collaborator Betty Schaeffer. Vicki had no other lover on the outside - it was only Norman. That is why, when he commits suicide, Vicki goes into seclusion.There is a triangular figure in SUNSET BLVD. for Norma, in her butler Max Von Mayerling. He had been her first director and husband, and he is also (in his over-devotion to her) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy. It is a sign of her insanity that she never notices that the letters are written by the same hand. Wilder had used Eric Von Stroheim in FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO as Rommel, so he knew what it was like working with him. Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max (like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes) which Wilder managed to push aside. Von Stroheim's performance (one of his greatest) was not harmed by these cuts, although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained. But by reducing the neurotic behavior of Max (to just his pathetic need to be near Norma to support her) it keeps us concentrating on Norma's psychosis - where it should be.Norma is the driving force to the end, pulling the wires that manipulate Max, Joe, Betty, even (out of a sense of pity) Cecil B. DeMille and his production staff (example: the light man ""Hogeye""). Even with the ""waxwork"" friends who crop up for cards, Norma seems to be in control (they all congregate to see her - the richest among them). Even with people who are supposedly independent (the funeral home people who cater to her burying her pet monkey; the salesman on commission who urges Joe to buy the vicuña coat) she manages to keep this control. She is the central sun/""Star"" in this galaxy - and cannot brook any deviation. The rejection of the ungrateful Joe can only be appeased physically by his death, and emotionally by her mind clouding that failure and it's aftermath from her memory. From the start of the film, with all her egocentricity at work, only a psychic slap in the face was missing to complete the tragedy. Then she was finally ready for that close-up.",Sunset Blvd.
49,Lejink,Boulevard of broken dreams,9,3 August 2010,"What a movie! Boasting one of the best ever opening scenes and most remembered conclusions, with filling to match, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a magnificently cynical overview of Hollywood, uncommonly using real names and real people for veracity.Starting with the magnificent conceit of having the whole movie narrated by a dead man, we roll back from the unforgettable shot of William Holden's corpse looking down at us from the bottom of Norma Desmond's pool in what must be the longest ever flashback in movie history taking us up to the moment of his death and its aftermath.The movie works on so many levels, taking in the hollowness of Hollywood, the transience of fame, the fear of rejection, the onset of age, there's all this and more as William Holden's kept man finds in the end he can't escape the gilded cage that faded movie goddess Desmond has built around him. The plotting is sure, the direction masterful and the cinematography at times evocative of the best monochromatic shots from ""Citizen Kane"" (there can be no higher praise), especially in its handling of perspective shots.It goes without saying that Wilder and Brackett's dialogue is brilliant with so many of the phrases entering movie legend the second they're given breath. Holden is superb as the doomed writer, closely followed by Erich Von Stroheim as Desmond's first husband now reduced to being her lackey, excusing her every erratic action out of love. Gloria Swanson goes over the top to Everest level and occasionally overdoes it, but that may have been the director's point anyway, although I think it was right that she didn't win the Oscar this year, despite being nominated and heavily tipped. It's not every film you'll see boasting Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Cecil B De Mille in a row in the acting credits, but while the first two get the merest of cameos, De Mille is completely natural and sympathetic to his requirement to both indulge and yet brush off Desmond's misplaced ambitions as himself.Add to the broth Franz Waxman's atmospheric score and you have the perfect recipe for a genre - busting film noir from maestro Wilder. I make it a point never to watch films more than once if I can help it but I just know there's so much more here than meets the eye, and that's more than enough for starters.",Sunset Blvd.
50,ElMaruecan82,Hollywood's Self-Iconoclast Masterpiece ...,10,13 June 2011,"""Sunset Blvd.""' left such an impression on me I sincerely doubt on the usefulness of this review. Everything has already been said about Billy Wilder's masterpiece, and I would only be paraphrasing the obvious. But I guess, such dilemmas are sterile ... so let's talk about one of the greatest American films ever, and my gut-feeling on that matter is that the success of ""Sunset Blvd."" is particularly ironical.The principal irony is that one of the greatest American classics is precisely the one that deconstructed the myth of Hollywood. ""Sunset Blvd."" resonates as a cinematic pamphlet against the corruption of minds that governs a quite decadent business. Billy Wilder, was a respected and admired artist, and yet he did the epitome of iconoclast films. Some may say it cost the movie its ticket for the Best Picture winner, which went to the eternal rival ""All About Eve"", another great classic that had the good taste to attack the less glamorous stage world. ""Sunset Blvd."" kills the myth in the pinnacle of its Golden Age, denouncing the way silent stars are treated like old relics, how young starlets are exploited, and how for one or two chosen, many contenders will end up working for B-movies or in peripheral jobs. Hollywood studios are sure a ruthless universe. The word ""iconoclast"" holds also a double meaning since it really kills the icons within the Icon. The film had probably shocked, but by deliberately choosing the cynical approach, it was ahead of its time and never lost its relevance ever since, no sir.The second irony is that by deconstructing the same myth, it has prevented it from sinking into oblivion. Let's face it, many movies glorified the Golden Age of Hollywood, yet the only one that had the guts to criticize it, indirectly reminds of how great and irreplaceable these days were. Hollywood couldn't have had a better homage than a movie like ""Sunset Blvd"", as cynical and detached as Joe Gillis' narration sounds, it still speaks Hollywood's true language. And I'd go further, I'm sure Gloria Swanson would have been totally forgotten had this role not been given to her. Through Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson was immortalized and forever remembered as that actress with the unforgettable look and who portrayed one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. Yes, we know there was Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, but I'm sure these actresses are more names and faces for movie fans while Gloria Swanson immediately reminds of ""Sunset Blvd."".And this is the third ironic aspect of the film, the movie is believable because almost everyone is playing his own role. Gloria Swanson was indeed a has-been star forgotten by her peers, Erich Von Stroheim a has-been director whose disastrous ""Queen Kelly"", starring –guess who- Gloria Swanson, derailed both careers. It was that film she was screening to William Holden. The self-reflexive aspect is so well-constructed you need to watch the film a second time, to realize that the characters within the actors were also playing a game. Joe, the struggling screenwriter exploiting Norma's love to have time to get back on the business, and Norma exploiting Joe's need to make her comeback and be with him, and as the band leader of a grotesque masquerade, the butler, Max, Erich Von Strohem who maintains Norma in total denial, literally directing her life. It's all about living in illusions, like the doomed love between a woman alienated by her own image and a man totally disillusioned. ""Sunset Blvd."" Is simply fascinating.But I must add that the story is only one of the many fascinating elements that make the film a classic among the classics. Never had a movie combined such a close to perfect writing with an incredible direction, it's Wilder at the top of his game. When you think of any of the most iconic lines of the film, and it sure is full of them, you immediately associate an atmosphere, a darkness, a face. The cinematography, the direction perfectly convey the creepiness and moral ambiguities of film-noir. ""Sunset Blvd"" is a masterpiece for totally objective reasons, one of the rare films, it is impossible to find any flaw in it. From the beginning till the end, the impression, the film leaves on you is its indecent closeness to perfection.And I can't end without mentioning the title ""Sunset Boulevard"" which works as a beautiful metaphor of the end of an era. An end forever incarnated by the creepy mansion of Gloria Swanson, this lady with hands and arms that wave as the tentacles that tried in private to take the poor Joe Gillis as a sentimental hostage. And despite all his suaveness, and manly confidence, Joe is just a ghost writer, when Norma is an actress absorbed by her own image, and one man, Max who directs her life, or does he? Who controls these people anyway, they are all guided by their own love for their business ... and the genre, the opening, the setting of the film will respect your intelligence enough not to get you expecting a happy ending. Or was it? In a certain way, Joe was still the ghost writer in the real sense of the word, Norma was still acting, being the heroine of her twisted imagination, facing the cameras, and under the direction of Max who knew the only language that could make Norma Desmond receptive.And this is the beauty of the film, beyond the darkness, it's just an incredible and unforgettable introspection into the world of cinema. I could speak longer about the film, but I think I made my point now, but this is the beauty. It's just me, and the laptop, and those beautiful people out there behind their screens. All right, IMDb, I'm ready to submit ...",Sunset Blvd.
51,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Monkey business.,8,2 October 2019,"'Sunset Blvd. (1950)', a veritable cinematic classic, is surprisingly meta, comprised almost entirely of interlaced 'Easter eggs' which take the form of 'art imitating life', celebrity cameos and, of course, movie references. This 'self-eating snake' nature is perhaps appropriate considering that the piece is still one of the best, most in-depth insights into - and a near damnation of - Hollywood, specifically 'old Hollywood'. It's also a keen portrayal of a sad kind of self-obsession usually associated with famous artists, one that the person often clings to beyond all hope primarily because their personality is so intrinsically tied to it. This self-perpetuating cycle of defining one's worth by how much strangers 'admire' them is certainly toxic and is, quite boldly, on full display. Ultimately, the picture is rather bleak, showcasing how society often enables dangerous behaviour by awarding it with their attention. The themes I've mentioned would be enough to float an entire flick but this one has even more still. It looks at money, financial security, loneliness, emasculation, creativity, mental illness and attention-seeking behaviour. It's remarkably interesting. It's also consistently entertaining, styled with a lavish 'noir' aesthetic that paints every frame, along with the usually decrepit things within them, in a beautiful black-and-white hue that somehow has a real thematic resonance in and of itself. The purposefully heavy-handed, hard-boiled but often flowery narration adds to the narrative's eerily enigmatic nature. The story is seemingly straight-forward, yet it's also oddly bizarre in the best way possible. Everything just feels like it's on top-form, here. The direction uses dazzling camera-work to invigorate the dialogue-based plot, beginning with an absolutely brilliant one-shot title-sequence and otherwise featuring its lion's share of inventive angles (the under-water shot is a real highlight and a proper bit of technical wizardry, too). The performances perfectly walk the line of realism and 'showbiz', with the balance being palpably different for each character. Swanson's Norma Desmond almost feels like she's acting in a silent movie, oozing intensity from every facial feature, whereas Holden's Joe Gillis slowly transitions from a 'Golden era' star to a paranoid, under-the-thumb man who thinks he's trapped with some sort of 'B-movie' monster and may actually like it. Tying everything together is this 'behind-the-scenes' feel. You're being taken on a tour of the very thing that produces pictures like this and people like Desmond. The more you read about it after the fact, the more you realise that it must've been shot through some sort of mirror. It may be a fictional tale, but it resembles reality in more ways than it doesn't and sometimes simply presents it to you (or a version of it, at least). Its haunting end is one of the most famous of all time but the whole affair is worthy of that status. It's an ahead-of-its-time experience that's as enjoyable as it impressive. As I said, it's a classic. 8/10",Sunset Blvd.
52,gbill-74877,Excellent,9,7 March 2018,"There is a lot to love about this movie, which is loaded with great performances, and intersects film noir with fading Hollywood stardom. It grabs us from the start with police called to the scene of a mansion with a body floating in its pool, and as we listen to a deadpan narrator. Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body. The film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money. He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson). The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it. While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies. Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment.Gloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes. The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites. Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none. The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special.Wilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is. It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic. We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there. It's a very touching moment. Things get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fiancé (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet). Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming.The film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence. Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on. With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",Sunset Blvd.

54,secondtake,A Love Poem to the Movies,10,3 June 2009,"Sunset Boulevard (1950)A Love Poem to the MoviesYes, Sunset Boulevard is a love poem to the movies, to the silent era and its shimmer, and to the studio era and the beginning of the end of the Golden Age. Even if this isn't to your taste (and if not, shame on you), this has to be a perfect film. It's original and imitative, it's prosaic and profound. It moves with fluidity and visual splendor (odd to find myself preferring that word here). The main characters are so lonely and pathetic, and so deeply human and sad, you recognize yourself in them--your future self, at least.And it is a movie about love and death, about growing old enough to not know if you can be loved, and if you are loved, not knowing why. Both ways. This touches a chord for me. It comes at the end of my favorite decade for movies, the 1940s (which begins with 1939, expansively), and it comes as a pinnacle of film noir, though an odd example. It kills the main character in the opening scene and has him giving the voice-over anyway. Pretending to resuscitate an old silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, it actually resuscitates Gloria Swanson herself. It brings Cecil B. DeMille back to the screen, back actually on the screen, in a poignant and slightly ironic role (he plays the part of filmmaker with businesslike kindness, his sweetness genuine but also practical). And Erich von Stroheim, ever gloomy and disgruntled, but omniscient, too, the only one who seems to understand exactly why this is happening, and think it all for the best.If you are not (yet) an old film buff and have heard of none of these people from earlier eras, you can watch it as a richly filmed crime/noir/screenwriter movie (all three) with enough twists and interior monologues to satisfy even the most bored and jaded viewer. If we get past all the pre-post-modern references and homages built into the cast and plot, we can see something about Joe Gillis, a failing screenwriter played by William Holden, lost in the world, thinking he has morality and talent and even some good looks, but somewhere things have gone wrong. All he has to do is right himself, but the boat is stubborn, and only the illusion of redemption lures him out, and he begins to write even though he knows it's futile, and we know it's futile. We know in the beginning he dies in the end. Work, and working, whatever the milieu, is just that exercise some of us go through to make it to tomorrow alive, filling the days, persuading others that we're fine, that life has meaning. Such people (I'm not sure if I'm one of them) even fool themselves, because a life like that might have no meaning other than itself--the present moment, the doing as it is being done, and when it seems that the work will bear fruit--that Gillis's script has possibility--all becomes false and temporary.In this poem the heroine is unlikely and outwardly insufficient, and because of that she is perfect and more than enough--Nancy Olson, that person we really are out here in reality land, the one who is on the fringes of hope but who is, actually, happy inside. Or at least knows how to be happy--partly by dreaming, partly by taking chances, and mostly by being grounded and honest with yourself.Another aspect to watch is the insider look at movie-making. A few films swing you behind the scenes, behind the camera, and this does it during that big picture, factory feel of the studios, and though brief, it's a thrill. The fact that Norma Desmond (the Swanson character) is out of touch with it all is sad, of course, but isn't that also what life is all about, the passing of one thing and the rising of another?Who would have thought such a fantastical mind blower as this would be about the nitty gritty depths of reality? And what about the funeral procession for the monkey, coming down the stairs? My god, what a film!",Sunset Blvd.

But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a ""kept man"". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement.

The entire cast and crew shine here, from the set people, the actors, the writers, the director, and so on. William Holden headlines as a down on his luck screenwriter who stumbles onto an old time Hollywood silent film star, Gloria Swanson. The slightly mad Swanson sets him up in her massive rundown house. She wants him to write a screenplay that will put her back in the limelight. Erich Von Stroheim plays the butler and man Friday to Swanson and the estate. He is the former first husband of Swanson. Holden is plied with expensive gifts, fine clothes, watches and gold cigar cases etc. It puts a roof over his head so he stays on. It all gets a bit creepy for Holden when Swanson swears that she loves him. Needless to say this is going nowhere good for Mister Holden. I will say no more about the story, but if you are a Holden fan, you need to treat yourself to this masterpiece. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards including nods to Swanson, Holden, Von Stroheim and Director Billy Wilder. The film did win three Oscars.

This is a movie making at its very best. The real star of this movie in my opinion was the script. Every sentence in this movie is great, it's lead up to something, and it fully engages you in this movie. The story itself is very simple, yet the script makes it astonishing. There is not one boring or uninteresting line in this movie - this has to be of the most polished scripts in the history of cinema.

59,ironhorse_iv,"Alright Sunset BLVD, are you ready for your close up?",9,6 September 2013,"The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.",Sunset Blvd.
60,kenjha,Sublime Masterpiece,10,10 September 2009,"This is not only the best film about the movie business, but one of the greatest achievements in cinema. Swanson is flamboyant as Norma Desmond, a role that was a reflection of her own career. von Stroheim also plays a variation of his true self. While both are superb, it is Holden's comparatively understated performance that holds the film together, as he brilliantly conveys the desperation and self-loathing of a hack writer. Olson is also excellent. De Mille and other Hollywood legends are ingeniously integrated into the script as themselves. Wilder made some of Hollywood's greatest films but this is his masterpiece. Waxman adds a haunting, atmospheric score. Unforgettable.",Sunset Blvd.
61,briancham1994,The ultimate psychological noir,10,23 August 2021,"Norma Desmond is the epitome of the Hollywood has-been: a narcissistic, privilege, histrionic old woman who is stuck in the past, failing to realise the world has moved on without her. The casting of Gloria Swanson is perfect, both in terms of her insanely flourishing performance and the meta aspect of her career. Her environment reflects her own mental state - unkempt, luxurious and isolated, existing in solitude and maintained only by the most superficial facade of fandom. It is the chance appearance of Joe Gillis that upsets all of this, triggering Norma's need for affection and conflicting with Joe's career desires. This ensnares the characters in a claustrophobic dilemma that grips them until it is resolved through the peak of sheer insanity. This nightmare scenario is fuelled mainly by the expert acting that brings the anguish to life.",Sunset Blvd.
62,TheMovieDiorama,Sunset Boulevard drives down the venomously paranoid streets of a scathingly ruthless Hollywood.,10,13 August 2019,"Silver screen classics, particularly noir films, drain the life force out of me. They require effort, stamina and widened blood-shot eyes in order to bypass the often gruelling glacial pace commonplace in films of that era. Then you get the odd few, '12 Angry Men' for example, that surpass even the greatest of expectations. Offering more captivation than a modern masterpiece, ageing finer than a bottle of Châteauneuf du Pape. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why we watch films. Sunset Boulevard may just be one of the most proficiently entrancing films I've ever watched, and I adored it.An unsuccessful screenwriter is hired by a faded silent-film star to write her screenplay, marking her ambitious return to the silver screen. Yet, when delusions become obsessions, her paranoid fantasies start to shroud him in a poisonous fog of wealth and ownership.Before I envelope myself in my own stream of consciousness, I want to start with some bold statements. Here goes nothing! Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is one of the greatest performances of all-time. Wilder and Brackett's screenplay is one of the greatest scripts of all-time. And, Sunset Boulevard is possibly the greatest story about Hollywood. Period. Now, just let those comments sink in for a moment. Much like you, I am also surprised by the overwhelming praise that flooded my mind as I watched this. But it happened. The infamous quote was executed. ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up"". And it was the first time I noticed that I blinked. For nearly two hours, I was hypnotised by the level of quality that was being output way back in 1950. Stunned into silence, I had to patiently wait for the overwhelming sense of perfection to leave my body.Sunset Boulevard was effortlessly perfect, and the majority of that stems from Swanson's excruciatingly realistic performance. This drama, first and foremost, is a character study. A silent-film star trapped in her own deluded mind where fame, fortune and popularity is left unchanged. Her refusal to accept change, her inability to progress, her latching onto her own self-importance. It's regressed her mentality into a state of delusional grandeur. Forming a tangible fantasy of her fabled ""return"" to the screen.Wilder's close attention to Swanson's theatricality grants us minuscule details when depicting her regressed state. The exaggerated body movement, particularly of the arms and face, are a secondary result of her excessive work in the silent-film era, almost likening her to a vampiric entity. The schizophrenic behaviour, instantly switching between happiness and melancholy, encapsulating her broken mental state. And none of this, absolutely none of it, would've been possible without Swanson's masterful performance. In fact, it's one of the greatest. She beautifully realised the character of Norma Desmond with an equal balance of power and fragility. It may just be one of the most accurate performances depicting melancholy that I've had the pleasure of viewing. Her range was extraordinary, and she devoured every single artistic set piece.Then you get Holden's illusory narration that exhumes the mind of a skilled writer. The flow, tempo and idyllic vocabulary. A poetic river that explored the illusory world of Hollywood. It instantly ensnared me with its sharp dialogue, allowing us to empathise and sympathise with his reluctant choices. Wilder's humour, and believe me there are some giggles to be had, compliments the delusory world being depicted. Fractured, almost. One scene you'll smile, the next you'll glance in fear. A clashing of tones orchestrated to produce a gorgeous symphony of thematic competence.Wilder's strong directorial hands ensured that the splitting of tones was minimal, only allowing subtle hints of fragility to seep through the cracked walls of the dilapidated mansion. A microcosm for the incongruous mind of Norma Desmond. Such simplistic yet memorable art design that emitted a trapped state of disrepair.Waxman's soothing score also alluding to a fantastically perfect world that Desmond embraced, yet still managing to draw up tension when required with erratic pitch changes. The majestic costumes, the concise editing, the gorgeous cinematography, the supporting performances. Nothing in this picture was wrong, and that's a rare statement for me to make.The ethereal aesthetic, considering it's entirely narrated by a murdered victim, only enhances the ghostly quality of its lead character. It's acute depiction of Hollywood's evolution, never steering away from its extremities, makes it one of the best films exploring the industry. It's definitive. It's sensational. It's perfect. Yes, Sunset Boulevard has just acquired the highest score possible. If ever there was a classic you need to watch, this is the one.",Sunset Blvd.
63,matthewssilverhammer,"""Funny how gentle people get with you once you're dead.""",10,23 April 2018,"Sunset Blvd. is a capital D Dark comedy, perfectly walking the line between extremely unsettling & absurdly hilarious (dead ape). The writing is among the best of its kind; flowery & full of noir-heavy tropes that sit within the genre while standing above it.

64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Wilder's finest noir pulls the curtain back on Hollywood and induces shivers,9,30 December 2009,"More than a half century after ""Sunset Blvd.,"" audiences are well aware that Hollywood is not all glitz and glamor -- that there's a stark reality. Yet despite that knowledge, ""Sunset Blvd."" is still an eye-opening and deeply affecting motion picture today as it was in the 1950s. Because even though our ""access"" to Hollywood is greater than that of yesteryear, great film-making and chilling performances are timeless and that's what this classic delivers.Billy Wilder was already famous for his string of films in the mid-late '40s, but ""Sunset Blvd."" is in a category of its own. There's something shockingly real about this noir drama. Maybe it's the fact that actress Gloria Swanson, who plays faded silent film star Norma Desmond, was in need of a comeback herself, or that famous director Cecil B. DeMille plays a big role as himself, or that several old silent film stars such as Hedda Hopper and Buster Keaton appear in the movie as Norma's friends. It's kind of enchanting really, but doubly so because of the suspenseful tone of the film.""Sunset Blvd."" is about a work-starved screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden) who by coincidence ends up in the mansion of an old silent film star, Norma Desmond. Desmond has written herself a comeback (or return, as she prefers) role and convinces Gillis to redraft it. Oddly, however, she insists on him staying at her mansion, where he inevitably becomes her plaything.The script by Wilder and longtime collaborator Charles Brackett (along with D.M. Marshman Jr.) creates some awkward but powerful moments, such as a New Years Eve party where Gillis discovers he's the only guest. Although the beginning scene was a last-minute addition, the excellent shot of him floating in the pool is the first of many affecting images and scenes that Wilder has crafted with a touch of horror and creepiness to be truthful. Franz Waxman accentuates this tone with his suspenseful score.But it's way Gloria Swanson carries herself as the iconic Norma Desmond that generates the creepy effect. Head tilted back, she stares at you with those 1930s movie star eyes and moves her hands in such a manner that will terrify everyone just slightly. Not getting an Oscar win just goes to show what a great year for film 1950 was, though speculation is the film's mildly negative portrayal of the industry could have been partly responsible. All the main characters in this film got nods but lost out on the prize in fact -- and truth is all were deserving of being there.It's hard to see now, but Hollywood was all about reputation in those days. It was about the image and deceiving the public with glamorization of the business. ""Sunset Blvd."" was a classic of its time for getting beneath the veil that Norma oh so cleverly has on when she goes to visit the great Mr. DeMille, but it's a classic for all-time because of the subtle haunting quality of Wilder's work and bewitching performance of Swanson.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com",Sunset Blvd.

66,funkyfry,Truly excellent film about Hollywood,10,13 July 2007,"Director/writer Billy Wilder and associates have created a film that rises above even the level of even a lot of the best melodramatic films of its era by ingeniously creating a device  the story focused on a silent film star and her distorted self-image  that encompasses the style and limitations of melodramatic acting itself, making a performance from Gloria Swanson as former Sennet bathing beauty Norma Desmond seem perfectly appropriate even at times when it might otherwise have been considered laughable. In fact the film in general shows a real black comic streak, right from its famous opening shot of screenwriter-turned gigolo Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating face-down in Desmond's swimming pool.One thing that stands out in the film is that it manages to be at the same time a very caustic fable about the allure and corruption of Hollywood while paying tribute to the classic era of silent films. Now that the film itself is older than the films it was then paying tribute to, it seems if anything more poignant then ever. It's true that Desmond eventually becomes a ridiculous person, but if anything the pathetic nature of her later years accentuates the marvel and the dignity of her earlier stardom and the era when she ruled the box-office. I'd actually be surprised if many people have not been introduced to the romance and majesty of silent cinema through this film  a film which ironically mocks the ""talk, talk, talk"" of the sound era while including some of its very best dialog. Although in many ways more grotesque than the average Lon Chaney or Boris Karloff character, Norma Desmond also captures the sympathy of the audience like all great movie monsters. It's possible to see Norma as a ""femme fatale"", but I think her situation too pitiful for that designation  I would liken her instead to Frankenstein's misunderstood and abandoned Monster (created as she was by Max, after all) or to the regal Dracula, hiding from the modern world in his ancient castle while he waits for new blood to devour and corrupt.There's a great deal of sadness and mystery, too, in this concept of 1920s Hollywood as a kind of lost and unlamented world. This is of course heightened by the presence of supporting actors like Buster Keaton, Ana Q. Nilsson, and especially director Erich Von Stroheim  like Swanson playing a thinly-disguised grotesque version of himself. Von Stroheim's Max is, like the troubled artist himself, a former director; his present-day role as a butler is fitting also because Von Stroheim had to play a number of such menial roles in his later years. ""Sunset Boulevard"" provided a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Von Stroheim and Swanson to show their powers once again; it's hard to believe either of them could really have thought of it as a ""comeback"" (the film's dialogue even mocks such pretensions), and they both give the kind of impassioned performances that leave no doubt that these brilliant performers have held absolutely nothing back, giving us two of the most honest and nakedly human performances of the era.My only complaint about the film is relatively minor  I've always felt that Joe Gillis is just too observant, world-wise, and engaging to really fall so completely into Norma Desmond's desperate clutches. The build-up is superbly handled, with the (often un-necessary and occasionally obtrusive) narration clueing us in to the fact that he thinks he can con Desmond initially but gradually becomes entangled in her life. I've just never completely believed the scene where Gillis leaves his friend's part to run home to Norma because of her suicide attempt. It's an effective scene, no doubt  Von Stroheim's manner and his announcement are so startling in the context of the revelry surrounding Gillis that the audience probably doesn't pause much to wonder why he is so upset or if he really would go back there right away. Frankly it seems to me like it should have confirmed his feeling that he needed to escape that place. Are we to believe Gillis' pronouncement that Norma was the only person in Hollywood who was good to him? And is his guilt enough to motivate him to return and become her lover, or is he primarily just a scared and bitter man seeking some asylum from the world? Certainly his character is intriguing but I've just never believed such a likable, interesting guy who really knows better and has good friends (especially frisky Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson, a character which vaguely reminds me of Betty Comden) supporting him would feel the need to shut himself up alive in a metaphorical coffin. Just because I don't want to believe it, though, doesn't mean it might be too close to true for comfort.I'm always fascinated by stories that break down the ""fourth wall."" This film succeeds in this difficult manoever with incredible style and verve. This is a film about success  the great prize of huge success which destroys the possibility of joy derived from less grandiose endeavors, and the sad and equally great price of failure when it comes from resignation and fear. These characters touch us deeply because it's impossible not to see their greatness, and through witnessing their tragic downfall we become conscious of our own limitations within a culture that determines the value of a human being through such narrow parameters. ""It's amazing how gentle people treat you when you're dead."" Our deceased narrator reminds us  this great film by Billy Wilder urges us to shed some tears for the living as well, trapped as we all are in such an ultimately senseless and uncaring world.",Sunset Blvd.
67,jzappa,A Classic That Engraves Itself On the Doorstep of the World In Which It Is Set,10,22 September 2008,"Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the blackly funny, often pitifully sad portrayal of a has-been silent star, alive as if against the knowledge of the outside world, in her misshapen manor, screening her old films, imagining unstoppably, relentlessly, of a return, that she is under the illusion will vindicate her fans, who all feel robbed of her. But it's also a disfigured love story, which while it keeps it from becoming simply a waxworks or a freak show, causes it to drag a little tiny bit.Gloria Swanson gives an unforgettable performance as the silent star Norma Desmond, with her covetous, melodramatic fingers, her theatrical gestures, her high-flying delusions of grandeur. William Holden considerately plays the role of the writer half her age, who lets himself be kept by her. But the performance that gives Swanson matching reverberation, relishing the film's Gothic grandiosity, is by Erich von Stroheim, as Norma's mysterious, devoted butler.The movie engraves itself on the doorstep of the world in which it is set, extracting so candidly from life in pictures that we can smell, lick, penetrate the special minutiae, the unequivocal parallels between the story and the actual actors themselves. What makes it so pitch perfect is how Wilder skates on thin ice flanked by black comedy and tragedy. Swanson's Norma Desmond slithers within millimeters of lampooning herself, taking huge chances with over-the-top sneers, affected lunges, theatrical posturings, and world-record- breaking narcissism, dangling Norma at the brink of psychosis for the vast majority of the movie, then creeping over. Norma obviously is not a wrinkly mummy. She is younger than stars such as Jane Fonda and Frances McDormand. She has aged only in her mind's eye, having grown obsessed obsessed obsessed with her moment of eminence in the past.What is most fun about Sunset Boulevard is how genuine Wilder had the wonderful nerve to be. He uses real names and shows real people, sometimes extensively. Sunset Boulevard gets to the bottom of the false impressions between audience and insider, and does not allow Norma Desmond to. The plot provides Holden with many reasons to agree to Norma's proposal of a job as her personal, hush-hush script doctor. He's bust, the rent is overdue, he is a fugitive from repo men, and he would hate to return to his job as a columnist in Ohio (It's always got to be Ohio! Why? What did we ever do to anybody?). He is as well not wholeheartedly reluctant to prostitute himself. Holden pitches faint fragility and internal struggle into his character. He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive. What is brilliantly satirical about all this is that in Hollywood, a screenwriter is so oppressed and low on the food chain that he will do anything to keep working. And what is furthermore brilliantly satirical is that Norma's life is not so bad. She's really her own worst enemy, which is what makes her story so pitiful.There is sure enough the young blonde studio writer with the highly predictable name of Betty, who is engaged to Jack Webb, but as Holden begins sneaking out of the house to work together on a script with her, she falls for him. He'd do her in a heartbeat, but he backs off, to a certain extent because he doesn't want her to find out the truth, but what's more because he shamefully likes the way of life with Norma. Wilder creates an exceedingly absorbing effect here, because when he escapes to see his old pal Jack Webb, and tension grows between him and Betty, Norma's world sure has gotten stuffy by that time and we feel a great deal of solace from her twisted realm.Of all the great directors of Hollywood's old days---Wyler, Stevens, Lang, Hitchcock---Billy Wilder was the biggest breath of fresh air. He knew how to blast a fun-loving sense of humor at you even in the face of knowingly pathetic subjects and characters. And he could go straight to the other extreme in the same film, outright disturbing you more than you ever thought a film from the old days ever could. Double Indemnity, Ace in the Hole, Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch, The Apartment, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Witness for the Prosecution, Sabrina and Sunset Boulevard all have a great comforting quality at the same time they are helmed by the silent man behind the camera who you never think about, the sublime master of mood swings, not to mention he consistently shows his strong sense of the importance of a memorable closing line, closing shot.",Sunset Blvd.
68,Vartiainen,About faded magic,6,14 January 2019,"Probably the director Billy Wilder's most well-known movie. In it a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis (William Holden), happens to meet a former silent film megastar, the dazzling Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She hires him to finish the script she has written, which is supposed to be her great comeback into cinema. But soon Joe finds himself pulled deeper and deeper into her life.I have to admit I have a fondness for movies that are about movies and the business of making them. Hollywood has built quite a legend around itself, a mythos even, and it is admittedly fascinating to watch.This movie is more about actors and acting than it is about movies in general, and it has quite a cynical tone to it. I very much like the fact that they cast an actual star of the silent movie era in Glorian Swanson. Gives the film authenticity. In Swanson you can see echoes of the distant past when movie stars lived like demigods, while the studios built entire sagas around their star power alone. Sure, this star power was carefully built, maintained and patented by the studios themselves. Not that this makes it any less interesting. Quite the opposite.Holden's performance is not bad at all, but it pales in comparison to Swanson's. Holden also talks a lot, providing the film with narration. I think I would have preferred the film without his constant input, but it's hard to say. He does add much needed snark, if nothing else.If we're talking about Billy Wilder movies, I liked both The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution a lot more, but this one ain't bad either.

69,bsmith5552,"""We had faces then""",10,12 January 2014,"""Sunset Boulevard"" or if you will ""Sunset Blvd."" is a classic Billy Wilder noir-ish tale of a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and a down on his luck screen writer Joe Gillis (William Holden and their May-December relationship.Gillis turns into a driveway while running from finance company representatives who are trying to repossess his car. On the grounds Gillis discovers an old mausoleum of a mansion that has fallen into disrepair. Mistaken for an undertaker, Gillis is invited inside where he discovers that the owner of the house is none other than Norma Desmond and her servant Max (Eric von Stroheim).At first Gillis wants to flee but then sees an opportunity to make some money off the lonely Desmond. The opportunity becomes reality when Norma invites Joe to move in where she showers him with money and gifts in return for his affection. All goes well until Joe becomes involved with studio employee Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen) with whom he falls in love. This leads to tragic consequences for both Norma and Joe.Gloria Swanson was anything but the lonely forgotten silent film star she portrays in this film. There were however, some interesting parallels to her own life. She did actually work for Cecil B. De Mille (who has a cameo in this film) and was directed by Stroheim in ""Queen Kelly"" (1928). She had faded from films in the 30s but kept working on the stage and in the occasional film. ""Queen Kelly"" is the film that Norma screens for Joe where she vows to return to past glory.For Holden, this was the film that made him a super star rather than just another contract leading man. He plays a totally self-serving character who uses Norma to his own ends.Stroheim who was best known for his extravagant direction of silent films, was actually a pretty good actor as well. His performance as Max, Norma's faithful former husband/director/protector stands up with those of Swanson and Holden.Also in the cast are Fred Clark as Sheldrake the movie producer, Jack Webb as Joe's friend Artie Green, Hedda Hopper as herself and as the ""wax works"" playing bridge, former silent stars Anna Q. Nilsson, Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner. Nilsson is shown puffing away on a cigarette, Warner looks asleep but Keaton (misused again) manages to get in one of his signature dead pan expressions in his brief appearance.A marvelous film and another Billy Wilder classic.",Sunset Blvd.
70,strong-122-478885,The Boulevard Of Broken Dreams,5,23 May 2014,"Yet, Another Wrong Turn.Now, here's a real piece of over-rated, vintage rubbish if I've ever seen some.And, Yeah-Yeah - I know that Sunset Boulevard (SB), like Citizen Kane, has been praised, since its initial release back in 1950, to the frickin' high heavens by critics and film-buffs, alike - But, hey, it's now 60 years down the yellow brick road, already, and, sorry, but SB just doesn't pass the mileage test as a 'Classic' of movie-entertainment, at all. No, it doesn't.Of course, I really liked actor William Holden as Joe Gillis, the out-of-work gigolo/screenwriter in SB. Sadly enough, in 10 years time Holden would become a chronic alcoholic, eventually killing himself in a drunken fall. Prior to that fateful moment, Holden was, without question, one of Hollywood's most attractive and likable male actors of the 40's and 50's. His presence here in SB can certainly attest to that appeal.But - On the other hand, I totally hated Actress Gloria Swanson, big time. I thought that she was a thoroughly despicable cow. (Moo. Moo.)Ironically, here was Swanson, the frickin' Hollywood has-been, playing just that on screen as Norma Desmond, the aging, Hollywood has-been. About the only diff between Swanson and her character was that Norma Desmond was a certifiable nut-case - While Swanson, herself, wouldn't reach that stage in her career for another 10 years when Alzheimer's finally sent her flying over the rainbow, for good.Back in her early twenties, Gloria Swanson, had once been the paid mistress of producer/politician, Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was the father of sons, John and Robert, through his mousy, little wifey, Rose.Kennedy had actually financed a number of Gloria's starring vehicles early on in her career. With each one being a subsequent flop, one right after the other, this would eventually seal the inevitable fate of Kennedy's little, hush-hush affair with Swanson, who was an utterly awful actress, indeed, even back then.",Sunset Blvd.
71,PWNYCNY,A tragic story as a work of art.,10,11 March 2014,"Sunset Boulevard is a great movie because it contains a tragic story which makes the movie a compelling work of drama. Gloria Swanson and William Holden portray complex characters, one a washed up actress and the other a failed screen writer, with personal needs that conflict. One needs love and the other one money. This simple formula provides the basis for a great movie.We know from the start that the principal male character, Joe Gillis, is dead and that the story is a flash back. This flash back hooks the audience's attention. We know that Joe has a story to tell, one that is worth listening to because something bad happened to him, and the question now is: why? The movie explains why. Joe, by chance, gets involved with a wealthy but emotionally unstable woman, Norma, who is in a position to cater to Joe's material needs. All Norma wants in return is Joe's love, a love that Joe does not feel for Norma. Now, Joe has a conflict: stay with Norma, whom he does not love, although he loves her money, or leave Norma and go back to where he came from, which is poverty row. Either way, Joe loses. How Joe goes about trying to resolve this conflict is what drives this story. The needier Norma gets, the more frantic Joe becomes. Joe describes himself as a heel. That's because he feels guilty over the way he is treating Norma. Joe's guilt feelings show that fundamentally he is a decent guy who does not know how to extricate himself from an impossible situation. If we did not know what happens to Joe from the start, his situation would seem comical: an eccentric middle-aged woman lavishing gifts on a younger man who is too much of a wimp to say no. Joe Gillis could be played by Adam Sandler or a younger Dustin Hoffman. Indeed, The Graduate reprises the older woman-younger man motif. But unlike The Graduate, where feathers are ruffled but nobody dies, in Sunset Boulevard the story is far from amusing; it is tragic. Joe dies and Norma loses what is left of her sanity. No one wins. Norma makes a grand exit to the police and Joe makes an exit too: to the morgue. That this happens in Hollywood gives the story a sardonic twist. Norma and Joe finally achieve the notoriety that they craved, but at a price.",Sunset Blvd.
72,ackstasis,"""I am big. It's the pictures that got small.""",9,6 July 2007,"Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' is a film about Hollywood. It is not concerned with the happy, idealised version of Hollywood that we would usually expect, but rather it offers a darker, more cynical outlook on the subject, a potent mixture of drama, romance and black comedy. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a failed hack screenwriter whose car is about to be repossessed. When he stumbles upon a broken-down mansion, he comes to meet silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose career floundered with the arrival of talkies, but who still maintains delusions of her own fame and grandeur. When Norma offers Joe money to edit the script for her big comeback, he simply can't resist the opportunity, completely oblivious to the fact that, by the time the events of the film are over, he will be dead.Very curiously, the film is shown in flashback form, narrated by Joe Gillis from beyond the grave. We first come across him floating lifelessly in Norma Desmond's pool, surrounded by detectives and photographers. The original edit of the film opened in a morgue, with the assembled corpses  Joe included  discussing how they came to be here. However, audiences considered the scene so ludicrous that they were unsure whether to approach the rest of the film as a drama or a comedy. After the removal of this opening scene, audiences reacted more favourably, and Joe Gillis' post-death voice-over adds a darkly humorous touch to the film, also successfully evoking the feel of a classic film-noir, of which Billy Wilder was a veteran (see 'Double Indemnity (1944)' for an archetypal classic of the genre).'Sunset Boulevard' really is a surprisingly contemptuous anti-tribute to Hollywood. Aside from casting Gloria Swanson as the long-forgotten silent star (who, herself, had struggled to adapt to the introduction of sound films), Wilder also makes somewhat sadistic use of Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. In a brief cameo appearance (credited as themselves), and described by Joe as ""waxworks,"" the three silent stars play similarly ""has-been"" actors who attend a bridge game at Norma's mansion. Furthermore, Erich von Stroheim  who plays Norma's sinister servant, former-director and first husband, Max  is forced to sit through a screening of 'Queen Kelly,' a disastrous unfinished 1929 film in which he directed a younger Gloria Swanson.Re-enforcing the theme that a certain level of corruption has seeped into new Hollywood, many of the characters are portrayed as being deceitful or manipulative. In a futile bid for self-validation and intimacy, Norma manipulates Joe into staying at her mansion, even threatening suicide on numerous occasions to prevent him from leaving her. Joe, on the other hand, exploits Norma's misguided delusions of success to provide him with financial security. Nonetheless, it is to Wilder's credit that he makes both of these characters appear somewhat sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the film, Joe partly compensates for his devious past behaviour, coming clean with Norma and convincing young budding writer, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), that she would be happier with her fiancé (Jack Webb) than with him. However, in typical Wilder fashion, having finally learned an important lesson about life, Joe is promptly rewarded with his own murder.By showing the decline of many of old Hollywood's finest stars, Wilder hints at the corruptive, devastating influences of new Hollywood, and of the modern studio system. This view was not accepted kindly by some in the industry; producer Louis B. Mayer famously confronted the director in public, declaring that ""you have disgraced the industry that made and fed you. You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood."" Fortunately, most in Hollywood disagreed, and 'Sunset Boulevard' was honoured with eleven Academy Award nominations, including three wins (Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music and Best Writing). Paradoxically, whilst the film explores the tragic degradation of Hollywood at the turn of the 1950s, this Billy Wilder masterpiece proves beyond doubt that, in that era, Hollywood film-making was in a golden age.",Sunset Blvd.
73,JoeB131,William Holden in a Scathing Satire,9,26 February 2011,"And, no, it's not ""Network'. But the films do have some interesting parallels between the characters of Joe Gillis and Max Schumacher. Both involve love triangles, both involve an intelligent man going along with a system he knows is full of manure. There is even a scene where Holden packs a suitcase and walks out on female lead. All very well done.This is a devastating view of Hollywood and its cynicism, and the participation of some key real people like Cecil B. DeMille and Hedda Hopper playing themselves, is quite fascinating. Gloria Swanson and Eric Von Stroheim playing washed up relics of the Silent Era was perfect.There is never a sex scene between Swanson and Holden, something that modern producers would probably have insisted on (tastefully shot, of course). In here, his status as a gigolo is only implied, as his self loathing is.This movie holds up really well, compared to the CGI vomit we see on screens today.",Sunset Blvd.
74,st-shot,Wilder lays Hollywood out in Lavender,10,22 May 2018,"Accused by LB Mayer of biting the hand that fed him Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is one dark, suspenseful but highly entertaining work of art. Arguably his finest script Sunset also gets career highs from pantheon cinematographer Joseph Seitz and composer Franz Waxman whose score not content to just provide background intricately attaches itself to the action, accenting one powerful scene after the next.Aspiring screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is trying to stay one step ahead of the finance company out to repossess his car when takes shelter in an old movie star's run down mansion. Mistaken for an undertaker there to wake her dead monkey he's persuaded to stay in a room over the garage but the washed up silent star Norma Desmond has other designs for him. He chafes at the gigolo role but finds the lavish lifestyle hard to reject. When he connects with another writer as collaborator and romantic interest he decides to make a final break from the unstable Desmond.Holden's sardonic narration and Gloria Swanson's delusional Norma deliver Wilder and Leigh Bracket's biting script with emphasis in every word as morbid humor mixes with tragedy within the suffocating stage of the oppressive mansion along with the dour butler (perfectly played by Erich Von Stroheim) and the few visitors, actual former silent stars playing themselves, referred to by Gillis as ""the waxworks.""Also playing themselves are a sensitive but forceful Cecil B. DeMille and a shrewish Hedda Hopper as well as the Paramount Studio itself. There is also a fine supporting performance by Nancy Olsen as the late love interest but nothing surpasses the strident performance of Swanson that some may argue is over the top in spots while at the same time demanding it to be effective. Sunset Boulevard is an expressionistic masterpiece by one of Hollywood's best displaying it at its worst. Superb celluloid theatre.",Sunset Blvd.
75,Lechuguilla,Hollywood Gothic,10,7 February 2011,"With the spotlight on Norma Desmond, one of the greatest movie characters of all time, played majestically by Gloria Swanson, ""Sunset Blvd."" oozes Hollywood Gothic, in a story that is as bleak as it is timeless.Although the script's protagonist is Joe Gillis (William Holden), unsuccessful screenwriter and opportunist, the heart and soul of the film resides in the character of older woman Norma Desmond, a reclusive movie star of years gone by, living in the past, vain, egocentric, yearning for a return to the camera.What makes Norma so memorable is her singular strangeness ... those over-sized hand gestures, eyes bugged-out, ghastly makeup, grandiose emotions, and living with her servant Max (Erich von Stroheim) in that overblown, creepy mansion, antiquated, baroque, and "" ... out of beat with the rest of the world, crumbling apart in slow motion."" Norma and her world are bleak beyond words. And yet, there's a humor in all that bombastic eccentricity.And the film's theme runs deep, as it turns on its industry overlords with a stinging indictment of Hollywood suits, cruel and heartless, spitting out actors and writers when they no longer generate money. Hollywood insiders are portrayed thusly as desperate, vain, egocentric, opportunistic, shallow, and delusional, much like Norma and Joe. Indeed, the Hollywood savagery of 1950 looks very much like the Hollywood savagery of today. Thematically, the film has not aged at all.B&W cinematography captures the story's bleakness well. Sets and props are suitably specific and detailed. The film's score is at times as grandiose and majestic as Norma. And Wilder's stylistic and flamboyant directorial flourishes add to the film's supremacy.My only complaint pertains to the script. The voice-over narration is a bit overdone. And the second half plot gives a little too much attention to the Betty Schaefer character. It's Norma Desmond that I want to see and listen to.These quibbles aside, ""Sunset Blvd."" is one of the great classic films of all time, a noir drama, wonderfully dreary and grim, yet funny, too. And that final sequence with Norma descending the staircase, addressing those around her in a mannered whisper, head tilted back, all bug-eyed and never blinking ... then as she looks into the camera ... Just terrific!",Sunset Blvd.
76,jimbo-53-186511,Arguably one of the finest critics on Hollywood whilst also being a brilliant film in its own right,9,6 October 2017,"Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a faded screen writer whom is at rock bottom when he fortuitously falls upon faded silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) after his car gets a blow-out outside her house after he is being chased by a couple of dudes from the finance company. A co-dependency ensues between Gillis and Desmond, but Desmond didn't bank on Gillis falling in love with Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen) an aspiring screen writer who threatens to interfere with the relationship that has been established between Gillis and Desmond....Billy Wilder is an odd sort of director to me, because out of the films of his that I've seen it seems fairly evident that he can do 'COMEDY ONLY' well i.e 'SOME LIKE IT HOT'. He can also do drama only well i.e 'ACE IN THE HOLE.' However, the meld is when he falls into trouble - think 'THE APARTMENT.' But SUNSET BOULEVARD is definitely an example of an excellent drama like 'ACE IN THE HOLE' ...It's hard to know where to start with this wonderful film, but I think initially we need to start with Holden and Swanson; Holden gives a nice, ill-at-ease quirky performance, although the cynic in me couldn't understand why Bogart wasn't cast in the role? He would have been perfect. This isn't helped by Holden's performance which felt very Bogart-lite. OK so the film is also creepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky, but it's not the Addams family... Having said that I felt that Holden underplayed wonderfully allowing Swanson to shine whom it has to be said was truly exceptional.I must admit though that I liked Max - he's Norma's butler, but there's something very Bondseque about him; I couldn't make my mind up whether he was a poor and stunted relation to Lurch from the Addams Family or a Bond villain's henchman from the 1960's or 1970's - answers on a postcard for this one please....I've joked about the above and yes at times it is hard to take some of this seriously - it is a tad theatrical and cheesy at times, but when it comes to its critique on Hollywood it is practically spot-on and for true cinema buffs this is an absolute must watch.",Sunset Blvd.
77,Nazi_Fighter_David,A film packed with unforgettable moments,9,15 April 2007,"Although at that time she hadn't appeared in a film for several years and wasn't to make one for several for several more, Gloria Swanson remained a presence in the Hollywood of the thirties, the only legendary silent star to sustain an image and continue to interest the film studios, which put her under contract and announced her to star in a series of projectsnone of which were realized While she wasn't to regain her former eminence until her celebrated comeback as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" a scathing satire on Hollywood and the self-delusions of its former heroes, she maintained her silent-screen image as the personification of glamor, and as such wasn't the initial choice for the role of the faded silent star Like many small people who achieve greatness, Swanson was a powerhouse of energy, vitality, ambition and shrewdness, untroubled by insight humor to slow down her pace The key to her success, the charm of her personality, the glamor of her career and the secret of her survival was superbly captured by herself in one of the best autobiographies, Swanson on Swanson",Sunset Blvd.

What I think really holds this picture together is the well-down over-the-top portrayal of silent film star Norma Desmond by Gloria Swanson.  William Holden also does a good job of standing his own as well in a quiet but effective performance.  Basically, this is a story  about a failing screenwriter's accidental encounter with Norma Desmond who still lives in the past with the household staff playing along at every beat. He then becomes entangled in her web and has to fight himself out of her grip, but struggles with this because he is being taken care of financially and socially. But once Norma gets jealous of Holden's encounter with another woman the inevitable happens(which I will not give away).  Overall, this was daring filmmaking for it's time with only some minor annoyances but otherwise splashingly good.",Sunset Blvd.
79,davispittman,"""I'm ready for my close up Mr. DeMille""",9,28 March 2018,"Sunset Boulevard (1950) is one of the most admired classic films of all time. It deserves all the praise that it has received and will always receive. Every facet of the film is done so well, especially the performances by the ever talented actors. Gloria Swanson absolutely made this film, her performance will blow you away. She commands every scene she's in, she has to because of her character. Her character is so complex and interesting, so much so that it's impossible to look away. The story revolves around a man who stumbles upon an old seemingly abandoned mansion and meets a middle aged washed up actress named Norma Desmond. She showers him with lavish gifts and lets him stay at her Hollywood mansion in exchange for him reading a script she wrote and editing it for her. Eventually, things become very complicated when other factors are thrown into the mix. And then that's where we get the real meat of the film. It really is a great film that is very entertaining. It may be very old, but it'll never lose it's quality or it's well deserved place on the list of the most famous films ever. 9/10",Sunset Blvd.

81,JoeKarlosi,Sunset Blvd. (1950) ****,10,10 June 2004,"I think this picture was definitely more deserving of ""Best Picture"" of 1950 than ALL ABOUT EVE. Probably it was the more ""offbeat"" nature of this film in those times that worked against it, much like THE EXORCIST didn't have a chance of winning Best Picture in 1973 (I think THE STING and even American GRAFFITI were better, though). A magnificent film, with great direction by Billy Wilder, and a fine cast. Gloria Swanson initially struck me as way over the top and wild-eyed at first, but given the whole nature of the proceedings, it's kind of understandable. William Holden is perfect as the desperate house guest, and Nancy Olson is the ideal girl-next-door. Eric von Stroheim is striking as Swanson's butler. A keeper that I'll seek out for myself on DVD, I'd place SUNSET BLVD. as one of the best films ever made, and it will occupy a position in my personal Top 100. **** out of ****",Sunset Blvd.
82,slokes,She Doesn't Want To Be Alone,10,10 October 2006,"""Sunset Blvd."" is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions, loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball, flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (""I hate that word,"" she says of ""comeback""). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's ""The Loved One"" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (""As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?"") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in ""Young Frankenstein,"" she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased ""Queen Kelly"") shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.""Sunset Blvd."" makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.",Sunset Blvd.
83,TOMNEL,Timeless.,10,31 July 2006,"This is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made. We start out where our main character Joe is dead in a pool.

The plot is that Joe is avoiding having his car repossessed by hiding out in an out of work actresses house, played by Gloria Swansen, who did the best acting job of her career in this film. It's a dark film, and almost seems as though it would have reached a cult status, but it reached a full fledged classic.

Many of us know the story, or have seen parodies of it (for example, on the Carol Burnett show). But if you have any interest in Old Hollywood, you will love this film. It touches on isolation, aging, psychosis, and melodrama in a most unique way.The visuals are Gothic and haunting. The old terrazzo floor on which Valentino danced the tango, the old stars at Norma Desmond's house, discarded, playing cards to pass the time. The omniscient Olympic sized swimming pool, never haunted by guests. A mansion filled with memories and mementos, but not people.Sunset Boulevard today has but a few old buildings, modern life has all but erased the Old Hollywood which existed at that time. Today it is a strange anachronism to see Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and advertisements next to it, for todays movies . This film is worth seeing more than once. 10/10.",Sunset Blvd.
85,Boyo-2,"All right, Mr. DeMille",9,14 March 2000,"Gloria Swanson must be commended for her bravery in taking a part which may or may not have echoed her own Hollywood career.

If this had been made with Mae West and Montgomery Clift, I would probably not be writing this and no one else would give a damn about this movie either.Both of them got Oscar nominations and I am sorry both lost. I am also sorry that ""All About Eve"" won Best Picture that year.  Of course ""Eve"" is a great movie, but its not this.This movie is part of our collective memory and most of the dialogue continues to be quoted even today.

86,Jonny_Numb,"A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain",6,21 August 2006,"""Sunset Boulevard,"" Billy Wilder's barbed take on the Hollywood studio system during its heyday is by turns volatile, funny, suspenseful, and--at its core--more than a little creepy. By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of ""Salome,"" Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, ""Sunset Boulevard""'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look.",Sunset Blvd.
87,Steffi_P,"""Who wants real? Who wants moving?""",9,14 April 2010,"With a medium like cinema, which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own, it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were – it is about the way motion picture people were, and continued to be.Indeed, the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making – voice-over narration, fluid camera-work, crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over, something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional, cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events, but more often than not it is superfluous to the story, and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who ""does not call attention to the shot"". On the contrary, he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery, Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects – such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses, or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with ""clues"" and reminders, bringing them to our attention at the right moment – such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be, which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars, and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek, animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp, but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic, but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille, who really had no sense of irony, and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures), although that is also perfect for the part he plays here – being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear, DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual – star, producer or director – from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear, it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond, the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling, and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger, free-spirited filmmakers – productions like Sunset Boulevard itself – that were beginning to rise to the surface.",Sunset Blvd.
88,TheFearmakers,"Lights, Camera, Distraction",6,17 May 2019,"When much too wordy for a dead guy narrator William Holden tells us about the dark ominous mansion he's happened upon, the direction and atmosphere doesn't match up. He could be walking up to a drugstore in the middle of a busy intersection and it'd be equally as suspenseful.Perhaps the best thing about the outrageously overrated Sunset Boulevard is it's a monster movie and in that, a terrifyingly creepy Gloria Swanson makes up for a bland and overly glib Holden who, outside the main location, has a flirtatious affair with cute ducky-lipped Nancy Olsen as part of a soapy Hollywood-satire melodrama that simply isn't thrilling enough to be called a thriller. And it's definitely not a Film Noir.If anything, Sunset is a satire on Hollywood BY Hollywood with its built-in gripes not very universal: a lot like another Hollywood satire (considered a classic as well) decades later, also starring William Holden. Both are vastly overrated.",Sunset Blvd.
89,Spondonman,The Silver Screen from the end of the Golden Age,9,26 July 2009,"Along with Double Indemnity, Sunset Blvd is one of the best films ever made. In my opinion however – because I'm amazed to find there are comments on the IMDb actually trashing it, but surely by people who also would regard a random pile of bricks as more arty than the Mona Lisa. Director Billy Wilder churned out some remarkable groundbreaking films, some being works of Art that have and will obviously outlast everything made over the last 50 years. I feel I know it off by heart having seen it so many times over the decades, but still come away impressed.Young and penniless film script writer (Holden) falls into the clutches of ageing ex-silent movie star (Swanson), takes the job of producing a worthwhile script for her and gradually becomes her toyboy to boot. Being red blooded he chafes at his position but feels he has no other option but to play ball. The plot moves smoothly and logically from A to Z, paying so much attention to detail it's no wonder a few tiny goofs crept in, like the film crew visible in Swanson's sunglasses. I don't count the unrealistic lack of blood on display from gunshots when after all the dead man is narrating the entire film. The production values were sky-high, the nitrate photography impeccable, the acting and the plot topnotch and believable. Favourite bits: Holden's expression upon seeing the dead monkey; Holden pegging butler Stroheim as slightly cuckoo; Holden and Swanson watching her and Stroheim's Queen Kelly on the big screen in her living room; buying the vicuña overcoat (and how good he looked in it too!); on the Paramount lot with DeMille; so many more.If Wilder was still young and making films nowadays no doubt they'd be full of mindless cgi cartoonery, sex and violence because it's required now discipline's dead, but Sunset Blvd was almost perfect, intelligent film making at its best.",Sunset Blvd.

Interesting drama and quasi-thriller, as the ageing issue is there, but also a noir-type situation in which the leading role character gets increasingly trapped.

It is a film about age that aged very well, a motion picture about the history of cinema made by professionals who have been important in that history, and a movie about bad scripts with an excellent one.

91,davidmvining,The normal way to bury a monkey,10,26 November 2019,"Sunset Blvd. is probably the Billy Wilder movie that Hollywood loves the most because it's about Hollywood. The problem that Hollywood movies tend to have and occasionally fall completely into is that they are insular without appeal to those not of the business. Sunset Blvd. is definitely full of the kinds of references Hollywood movies are tend to carry, but the central story is as relatable and fascinating from a basic human point of view that really gets the audience involved from beginning to end.Everyone is just out of place in this movie. The most obvious example is Norma Desmond, the silent star who's desperate to make it in the new Hollywood, but the rest of them are looking to move from the place where they reside to the place they wish to be. In the process, they have to play parts that they don't feel quite comfortable with. That conflict, which is present through every major character in the film, is what gives the film such a rich narrative texture.Joe Gillis is a down and out writer from the Midwest trying to make his way in Hollywood, but nothing he writes appeals to anyone anymore. He's on his last dollar and beginning to think about going back home. Running from repo men, he drives into a seemingly abandoned driveway which happens to be owned by Norma Desmond. In his desperation, he ends up as effectively her pet, replacing the pet monkey she buries on his first night in the house. What develops is an odd relationship (implied sexual) where Norma lords over Joe and Joe becomes completely subservient to Norma's whims. He accepts it to a certain degree, but he still chafes under it.He escapes nights at a time and meets with Betty Schaefer, a low level reader at the movie studio, to hammer out a screenplay that could make both of their careers (or not, Joe admits). Betty grew up in a Hollywood family and wants to be a real screenwriter instead of just a reader. She's on one end of the writing career path (Joe is on the other), and they're trying to meet in the middle. She's pretty, smart, a realist, and engaged to someone else.Through all of this, Norma is trying to get back into the spotlight. Her isolated life with only her butler, Max, has warped her mind. Max has directed her life in the background, writing fan letters for her every week and managing her day to day existence. She's writing an overlong screenplay of the Princess Salome (who was a teenager at the interesting points in her life) whom she plans to play (despite being in her fifties). She's the ultimate portrait of self-delusion, wearing a mask that she can't see through but everyone else can. She's convinced that she's just one writer and a single meeting with Cecile B. DeMille from getting her Salome on the screen. Joe is obviously that writer (admitting to us in voiceover that the script is terrible and no amount of his work on it will improve it). All along the way, even through her meeting with DeMille, everyone admits to themselves and to others Norma's delusion, but no one will shatter it for her.Joe's cynicism is what carries him through his experience overall, but it's also what allows him to finally be the one person to shatter Norma's vision of herself. The decades of her delusion, though, don't mix well with the revelation and Norma shoots Joe in the back, ending the movie where it began with Joe floating in Norma's pool.The movie is a wonderful look at delusion and deception, a very common motif in Wilder's work. The characters are rich with a great mixture of characters across the cynicism spectrum, each dealing with their own desires to be in their ideal places. Acting is great across the board, and the writing is elegantly assembled and witty all at once. It's a great piece of entertainment that thematically rich, visually resplendent, and just a fantastic time at the movies.",Sunset Blvd.
92,Spleen,Strange how I'd misremembered the opening.,9,20 March 2002,"The corpse floating in the pool, was, so far as I could recall, the very first thing we saw; and the first thing we heard was the narrator casually mentioning that HE was the dead man in the pool, and this was his story...Not so.  There's a little bit of scene-setting before we even see the corpse, with the narrator chatting away, seemingly with no particular aim; and by the time he gets around to using the word ""I"", which lets us know that this is HIS story, we've already cut to a flashback, which makes it quite easy for the viewer to miss the implied point (which is not, in the end, all that important) that we're listening to the words of a dead man.According to Otto Friedrich's ""City of Nets"", the original script's opening scene would have left us in no doubt.  Wilder had planned to show us bodies lying around in a morgue, with tags on their toes; suddenly, a few of the bodies would sit up, and start swapping stories about how they died.  Then Joe would get around to telling how HE died, etc., etc.  Apparently nobody liked this gruesome prologue, and Friedrich himself professes relief that Wilder's associates managed to talk him out of it.  I think the original prologue was a WONDERFUL idea: its brash insolence could only have helped the film.  Oh, well.  The more muted, inexplicit opening Wilder went with in the end is still a remarkably strong one.The film that follows is an enigma.  You've got to love the haunted mansion (haunted by a star of the silent era who is very much alive, even if her career is dead), and the sharp chromatic ditty that forms the basis of Franz Waxman's score, which worms its way into our heads and then NAGS us about something, although it's hard to say what; you've got to love seeing Wilder at his most visually eloquent (he may have been better with words than images, but he still had a better grasp of what to do with the camera than most directors), working with a script that manages to convey heavy fatalism while leaving us in constant doubt as to where it's going to go next. Perhaps the only reason I feel this falls JUST short of being Wilder at his best is that I can't even tell where it got to in the end.  Is there a moral?  It FEELS as though there is - but what is it?Don't believe anyone who says that this is some kind of Hollywood exposé. We know how dull THEY are...  The exposé element turns out to be a trivial part of the overall picture, anyway.  A brief, almost casually included conversation with Cecil B. DeMille reveals that Norma was driven mad not by anything that happened recently, not even by the years of neglect, but just over twenty years earlier, at the height of her success - and it was the excesses of the silent-era star system that did it.  The more muted Hollywood of 1950 Wilder depicts may actually be a healthier place.Or it may not be.  It's not the film's concern either way.",Sunset Blvd.

94,onepotato2,absurd,3,11 April 2008,"After coming to an appreciation and respect for Billy Wilder over the last twenty years, I thought I'd give this a second chance. But I still find it to be a long, flimsy, obvious movie with one static, overly drawn-out relationship, and a lazy second storyline with the blandest of bland characters. The whole concept is ridiculous. Who wanted to see the story of a failed writer, with the low ambition of being a kept boy, who squints his eyes and makes love to a horrible old shrew because he can't grow a pair to blow her off. That's the whole show for three quarters of the movie. A viewer just isn't asked to do much but pay attention. To make up for how little the story moves, it has a lot of over-the-top acing. I don't find it entertaining or particularly thoughtful. Wilder's run of remarkable movies has impressed me (except this, The Apartment and Some like it Hot). This would be the lesser half of a double bill with the similar Great Expectations, Vertigo or Streetcar Named Desire. I cannot imagine how excruciating this would be as a musical.",Sunset Blvd.
95,Seraphion,Constant quirks and a classic ending yet a bit too much,5,25 August 2014,"Well the story rolls in very much predictably at the opening sequence. But it then stirs into a quite monotone and boring length of lost dreams, quirks and parasitism. I almost stopped watching until the side romance color came in. and that side conflict held the movie together until it reached the quite classic ending. The thing putting the ending as the starting point of the story kind of reveal everything left in the story once the gun comes to mention. I like Gloria Swanson's acting in depicting the semi schizophrenic old star. Nancy Olson acted out just enough to have the balancing side for the story. William Holden did a slightly lacking performance due to not having used enough facial expressions and mimics although he has so many close-up moments.",Sunset Blvd.

A story that tells you —since the beginning of the first act— that its main character dies, and still keeps you interested until its conclusion? As if this were not enough for originality and commercial cinema value, ""Sunset Blvd."" is a great motion picture for other reasons: elegant ""mise-en-screen"", perfect balance between Gloria Swanson's acting style of the old school and William Holden's more naturalistic performance, an excellent score by Franz Waxman, and a story about love, chance, obsession, treason and delusion, far more important than its inside knowledge of the American film industry (which is indeed a bonus).

98,moviewizguy,A Hollywood Story,8,23 May 2009,"The story, set in '50s Hollywood, focuses on Norma Desmond, a silent-screen goddess whose pathetic belief in her own indestructibility has turned her into a demented recluse. The crumbling Sunset Boulevard mansion where she lives with only her butler, Max who was once her director and husband has become her self-contained world. Norma dreams of a comeback to pictures and she begins a relationship with Joe Gillis, a small-time writer who becomes her lover, that will soon end with murder and total madness.I'm surprised by this film. I really am. I thought I wouldn't have liked this film but wow, was this a brilliant film. ""Sunset Blvd."" plays like a satirical film noir, with hints of romance, comedy, thriller, suspense, horror, and surrealism, and yet, these things mix together perfectly on screen. It's kind of similar to ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" combined, with the whole faded famous actress who wants to come back on screen and the transition of the silent film era to films with audio, which is not a bad thing, really.The script is filled with impeccable and irresistible dialogue but, to no surprise, the one thing that makes this movie great, in the first place, is Gloria Swanson. At first, she may seem a melodramatic drama queen. Well, she is. However, as the movie progresses, you see her character becoming crazier and crazier, to a point, where, she's so crazy that she, herself, can't see that she's crazy. It's excellent! I don't know why she didn't win for an Oscar for Best Actress but she should have. I found her as a sympathetic villain, because we, the audience, know that she's a bit misunderstood. Her character becomes a faded movie star because of Hollywood leaving her behind in the silent film era. She has become stuck in the past that everyone else has moved on.William Holden does a well job, spending along side Swanson for most of the film. Erich von Stroheim, playing Swanson's butler, also does a fine job, and Nancy Olson does a fantastic job with hitting the marks with every scene she's in. The score by Franz Waxman was surprisingly great. I loved it. I should also give a shout out to the production and costume designers too. The black-and-white film noir cinematography, by John F. Seitz, creates some dramatic effects in some scenes.Overall, the film was nothing short of brilliant. Gloria Swanson, as the infamous Norma Desmond, is dazzling, along with the other three actors I've mentioned before. The script is just right for each scene and the end of the film is perfect. If you're a person who just loves watching movies, please add this onto your growing list of movies. You won't regret it.",Sunset Blvd.
99,LeonardKniffel,Gloria Swanson Gives the Performance of the Century,10,4 June 2020,"Exactly in the middle of the 20th century, Gloria Swanson delivered one of the best performances in film history. I have seen this movie countless times, but I can always find something new to admire. Watching it as an old person is very different from watching it young when I thought Swanson's portrayal of Norma Desmond was camp; now it seems like pure pathos. The style of the film is noir, melodramatic and eerily gothic, but Swanson's best scenes are not only the classic descending the staircase or snapping ""I am big; it's the pictures that got small."" The scene in which she begs Joe (William Holden) to love her is heartbreaking. I used to feel a bit sorry for Joe, bamboozled as he was into her trap; not so now. Holden's character is a liar and an absolute cad. Even when he seems to genuinely care for her after the suicide attempt, he is really caring only for himself. When the movie was released in 1950 the idea of a woman of 50--who we are told has been washed up for the previous 20 years, which means she must have been through at 30-- falling for a man half her age must have been shocking. But it really does tell the story of how Hollywood treated its great leading ladies. No such revulsion for the male matinee idols who regularly played love scenes with girls half their age. In Sunset Boulevard, we are told in so many scenes that Joe was practically nauseated by the idea of making love to her, but he is such a user that he continues to feed her delusions. It is also interesting to note that we are never shown a sexual scene, certainly not one of those deep kisses that Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper regularly planted on actresses who should have been playing their daughters. Is Sunset Boulevard over the top? You bet, way over, and I cannot get enough of it.",Sunset Blvd.
100,intelearts,425th Review: The Greatest Film Noir of them all,10,4 June 2011,"Sunset Boulevard is simply one of the great films; with a stunning script by Billy Wilder, a star in Gloria Swanson who makes melodrama and bathos into something deeply sincere and maudlin, all the parts come together in a way that hypnotizes and astounds the viewer.Fiercely and doggedly anti-Hollywood, but at the same time, all about Tinseltown this film is everything that Film Noir aspired to be and more: cool, dark, full of characters, and a sense of mystery, desire, and danger.This is one of those films that they will be watching in two or three hundred years time, now nearly 65 years old the plot and story are as fresh today as the day it was released. It still enthralls and shocks, and this reviewer can see no chance that it will fade away and be forgotten.Sunset Boulevard is one of the greatest movies ever. Full stop.

101,Handlinghandel,"After A Decade, It Seems Better Than Ever",9,5 September 2005,"Deservedly a classic of American movies. It holds up in spite o the ongoing parodies on the Carol Burnett Show, which sank some lesser movies. (Maybe they were homages as well as parodies.) A very dark movie, with everything right ion place. Holden is excellent, though at times his voice-over narration is a little arch. Swanson is fascinating. (What could this possibly have been like with Wilder's original choices -- Mae West for Norma and Montgomery Clift? Clift would have been good but West, much as I love her, would have sunk it.) Holden's interest in Nancy Olson has never quite made sense to me. She is attractive and appealing but her wholesomeness breaks the mood. That may have been the writer and director's intention. If so, I'd call it misguided. But who am I? Bill Wilder is one of the finest directors this country has ever known and I do not propose to second-guess him.",Sunset Blvd.

In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death.Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond.

Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts.Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes.

103,DeeNine-2,Among the best ever made,10,12 June 1999,"Joe Gillis, a failed writer played with an efficient cynicism by William Holden, blows out a tire escaping the repo man, limps into the driveway of an old Sunset Blvd mansion to hide, and thus enters a decadent world that traps him like a babe in a sticky womb. In this morality-tale, a la Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, we learn that even an accidental gigolo earns his keep, and then some.The voice-over and frame are appropriately reminiscent of a Forties' radio show, perhaps ""Inner Sanctum"" or ""The Shadow."" The images, from Gloria Swanson's greasy face and spidery fingers, to Eric Von Stroheim's wheezy organ, to the lighted pool with Joe's face down in it, (""This is where you came in"") are indelible.This is a great movie, built on character and story, well-crafted amidst the haunting atmosphere of an ""undead"" Hollywood.

The jaded newsman played by William Holden, the star herself, Gloria Swanson who just about steals every scene she is in, William does an excellent job in holding his own.  This is the ultimate comment on Hollywood by Hollywood. And it holds true even today when we observe so many has beens behaving so inappropriately (Goldie Hawn, pushing 60, giggling like a crazed 15 year old comes to mind) because they cannot let go of their days in the sun and keep projecting their younger selves to us as they have not come to terms with the people they have become. My heart aches for Gloria in this, though she is most unlovable and treats people abominably. The old bit players shine in this also, and of course Eric who continues to worship her because he knows no other life but that of sycophant.

105,sme_no_densetsu,Hollywood Gothic,9,17 April 2008,"This is a movie that takes a look at the dark side of Hollywood, focusing on the fringe-dwellers frantically trying to capture (or retain) a minute scrap of success by whatever means necessary.Gloria Swanson is easily the best thing about this picture. Her performance is riddled with theatrics but that's exactly what the character calls for. The fact that she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this role beggars belief. Swanson, Holden, Stroheim & Olson all received acting nominations but none took home any hardware, despite fine performances all around.There are a couple of likely reasons for the film's relatively small haul on Oscar night. First of all, the film was up against another classic, ""All About Eve"", which had garnered a record 14 nominations. Then, there was the scathing screenplay authored by Wilder, Brackett & Marshman. In particular, the story does a fine job of reflecting the amoral quest for success and the narcissism of the famous, hardly the image that Hollywood wanted to convey.Billy Wilder's direction here is well-handled and there are several moments of greatness, such as the famous ending. In that scene Wilder's direction, Swanson's acting and Waxman's score combine to produce what is surely one of the most memorable endings to any film ever.There's a reason (several, actually) why this film is considered among the greatest of all time. See for yourself and you won't be disappointed.",Sunset Blvd.
106,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,As fine as film noir gets!,10,26 October 2018,"How do you get more culturally meta with film than by making a film noir set inside the Hollywood landscape itself? Well, Sunset Boulevard answers that non-specific question in a beautiful fashion and then some by telling a story about 'delusions of grandeur' and how time's passage can become an unforgiving beast for movie stars still gloating about their 'good old days'. Norma Desmond is an out-of-touch actress who's refused to come to terms with, or accept, reality. She happens to come across struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis escaping from the men who lent him his car. After skidding onto the former star's driveway by coincidence, Joe's life takes one dark turn after another: and the film's look into career realism as well as its equally potent career naivety (even if the person it's coming from has more experience in real life). Norma is one of cinema's prettiest faces embodying the idea of tragedy and aged celebrity-status.Sunset Boulevard is the classically conceived kind of 'toxic valentine' that's inspired similar tales from Hollywood to exploit the many rewards and dangers of being blinded by show-business. It's film-noir that doesn't involve stealing an artifact or something: it's a film noir that comes from (and explores) the very medium where the genre began. It's meta-genius in classic American cinema.Sunset Boulevard gets 5/5 stars.",Sunset Blvd.
107,frankde-jong,"Best seen as a twin film with ""All about Eve"" (1950)",9,4 September 2020,"In 1950 there were two classic films about aging actresses, ""Sunset boulevard"" (Billy Wilder) and ""All about Eve"" (Joseph Mankiewicz). In both films the character of the aging actress was played by an aging actress. Bette Davis (42) in ""All about Eve"" and Gloria Swanson (51) in ""Sunset boulevard"".In ""All about Eve"" Bette Davis is aware of the fact that her career is coming to an end. This makes her cynical and the strongest point in ""All about Eve"" is the sharp dialogue.In ""Sunset boulevard"" Gloria Swanson keeps dreaming of a come back. This makes her a tragic person. The strongest point in ""Sunset boulevard"" is the acting style of Swanson. With her major successes in the '20s this acting style was already very dated in 1950. This however fits in perfectly with the character she plays in ""Sunset boulevard"".Ironically ""All about Eve"" turned out to be the come back of Bette Davis while ""Sunset boulevard"" definitely was the last great film of Gloria Swanson.",Sunset Blvd.
108,seymourblack-1,Living In The Past,9,2 February 2015,"The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent, found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty, cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.Joe Gillis (William Holden), a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with more debts than he can handle becomes involved in a high-speed chase when he tries to avoid the attentions of a couple of guys who are intent on repossessing his car. When one of his tyres blows out, he swiftly turns into the driveway of a run down mansion and successfully evades his pursuers. After parking his vehicle in the garage, he's surprised that the occupants of the mansion seem to be expecting him. It soon transpires that they'd assumed that he was the mortician who was due to deliver a coffin in which the lady of the house's dead chimpanzee was to be buried. Joe recognises the lady as Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a former silent movie star.When Norma discovers that Joe's a writer, she seeks his opinion of a script she'd written for her comeback movie (""Salome"") and then hires him to edit her work. In his financial circumstances the offer of this lucrative job is too good to refuse and at her request, he agrees to stay at her mansion to complete the task. Joe recognises that Norma is a delusional has-been who lives in the past and discovers that the fan mail she receives every week is actually written by her devoted butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim). The very wealthy Norma buys Joe expensive new suits and coats and together they watch her old movies a few times each week. Even more bizarrely, on New Year's Eve, she holds a party at which there's an orchestra but no other guests! Joe feels he needs to escape from Norma who's obviously fallen in love with him and so goes to a friend's party instead.Artie Green (Jack Webb) agrees for Joe to stay over at his place and Joe soon gets into conversation with Artie's girlfriend, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Joe already knew Betty who worked as a script reader for Paramount and the two of them subsequently start to work together on one of Joe's unfinished scripts. When Norma discovers what's going on, she becomes incensed and determined to bring their association to an end.The most striking feature of ""Sunset Boulevard"" is its sharp dialogue and numerous quotable lines which vary from the purely witty to the deeply sardonic. The fact that these lines are delivered by a screenwriter and a particularly flamboyant retired actress makes their exchanges seem perfectly credible as both characters would naturally have developed a way with words during their careers.The film's opening scene in which Joe is seen dead and face down in Norma's swimming pool is brilliantly shot and the off-beat device of having a dead man narrating the story is typical of the cynicism and dark humour that runs through everything that follows. At this point, when objectively talking about himself, Joe in typical style remarks ""the poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end, he got himself a pool"".The casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who both had careers in silent movies, invests the events depicted with a great deal of realism as do the cameos in which Cecil B DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and others are featured. Shots of Paramount studios and Schwab's Drugstore and the inclusion of an excerpt from ""Queen Kelly"" (1929) in which Swanson starred and von Stroheim directed also blur the lines between fiction and reality and add greater authenticity to the whole production.""Sunset Boulevard"" focuses on some of the more unglamourous aspects of Hollywood and must've made uncomfortable viewing for some people in the industry at that time. Its blend of biting humour and tragedy is very effective and the performances of its exceptional cast are consistently good from start to finish.",Sunset Blvd.
109,bobsgrock,Revenge on the System.,10,26 January 2008,"Billy Wilder pushed the envelope yet again with this bitter, cynical, and yet so true story of the aging, forgotten era of Hollywood that he claimed was still in love with itself. You can see that completely in the character of Norma Desmond, played to perfection by Gloria Swanson. She believes that due to the sound era coming into effect, all the great silent stars that are far superior are being ruined into obscurity. Basically, she blames sound for brainwashing the public. Yet, as we watch, we realize more and more that she is brainwashed into thinking she is still the star she once was. Wilder and Brackett have tremendous fun in this tremendous script that has to be one of the best ever written. It is so cleverly written, with touches of comedy, romance, and drama that it is hard to understand what type of film this is. To put it bluntly, this is revenge on Hollywood.

112,Jeremy_Urquhart,"An absolute classic, and essential viewing for all film lovers",9,17 February 2020,"Sunset Boulevard turns seventy this year and honestly that's pretty crazy. I'm not going to make any suggestions that are too outlandish, like claiming that this film hasn't aged a day, or that it feels like it came out just yesterday, because that's not quite true. There are things that make it feel like a product of its time but that's okay, because there are so many things about it that are still exciting, fascinating, entertaining, and provocative. One of Wilder's other classics- Double Indemnity- may be the definitive film noir in terms of being the most 'film noir' of all of them and defining the genre, but Sunset Boulevard is probably the best overall film of the genre.So for all the praise, I did acknowledge that there were some things that dated the film, and yeah, I gave it 9/10 instead of a 10/10. The flaws, however, are minimal, and honestly it's quite unfair to point them out because they may only be true flaws when watched today. For example, the soundtrack can be overblown and overly dramatic at points (really, this was pointed out by someone I watched this with, and I hated to admit it but she was sort of right), but back then, maybe this music didn't sound that way. And I don't mind it too much- it adds to the melodrama this movie does dip its toes into, and complements the larger than life character of Norma Desmond in many regards (we'll get to her more specifically later). In fact, everything with Norma Desmond is so great that when the film spends sometime with the protagonist getting to know another woman by the name of Betty, the film becomes slightly less interesting. Not in a way that kills the pacing, or makes me as a viewer disengage; it's just worth nothing. Thankfully, the character does eventually have an important reason to be in the story, and contributes well to the memorable climax, so again: it's really more of a nitpick.Now that all that pettiness is out of the way, time to recap the good stuff. There's a lot of it, so I'll probably miss something, but it's such a beloved movie that going over what makes it so good is perhaps going to feel somewhat redundant anyway. I love how meta this film is, especially for its time, and to my knowledge it's one of the first Hollywood movies to really be about movies and the industry that churns out films while also churning heartlessly through human beings. It's one of the overall best movies about movies I've ever seen. It's dark and subversive while also being at times morbidly funny, and must have been incredibly shocking and potentially even overwhelming for audiences at the time.The lead performances are all fantastic too. Swanson is absolutely amazing, delivering an over-the-top, very passionate 'silent move' performance but with dialogue, which creates something of an uncanny, mesmerising effect. She went all out and showed an often frightening level of commitment to the role; her character is tragic, sympathetic, hilarious, scary, and bewildering all at once. It's almost a shame for Holden and Von Stroheim that she's so good, because their performances are fantastic too, just not quite as showy. It's fascinating how similar Von Stroheim's character is sometimes to Desmond, in a far quieter way, while Holden does a great job as the film's protagonist, as well as offering up one of my favourite voiceover narration's in film history. Then there is the fantastic and brutally thought-provoking script, the typically great direction from Wilder, and the absolutely amazing set design and lighting. Norma Desmond's decrepit yet lavish mansion is one of the most memorable film locations in history, so much so that it almost feels like a shame when the cameras leave it to show things happening elsewhere. There is so much thought and effort put into how this movie looks and where it's all set, and it contributes to the story and overall mood so very well.Sunset Boulevard is close to perfection, and is a film I doubt I'll ever tire from revisiting every few years or so. It has a lot to say, and a surprising amount of it remains interesting and relevant. Additionally, it has an absolutely amazing and haunting ending, and an almost equally impressive opening scene for that matter. It's worth watching at any cost, even if you're not usually a fan of older films, as in my opinion, this is one of the best that came out of Hollywood's famed Golden Age.",Sunset Blvd.

So the arrangement is made: Joe becomes a working resident as Norma falls in love with him.In addition to Joe and Norma, two other characters in smaller roles have major impact. Firstly, there is Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim), Norma's dedicated (one could say pathologically dedicated) butler who has other past associations with Norma. Secondly, there is Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), a studio screenplay analyst with writing aspirations of her own including a collaboration with Joe.Joe's mindset lands somewhere between the opposite extremes of Norma and Betty. Norma fully believes in the illusion of Hollywood success and happiness. On the other hand, Betty is very clear and grounded about where she stands within the Hollywood system and she's found contentment with her lot - all this at the age of twenty-two. Joe begins to think less like Norma and more like Betty about his own situation before other events take a serious turn.One of the many praises of ""Sunset Boulevard"" is its parallel to real life especially with the choice of players who, in many cases, play themselves. Swanson, like Desmond, was a great silent screen star who failed to make the transition to talkies (this is difficult to believe considering her great work in this film). During a scene involving a bridge game, Norma's guests are Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson, and H. B. Warner, all former silent screen stars whose fame went to oblivion like that of Desmond/Swanson. And one of the best scenes involves Cecil B DeMille who also plays himself as a director working at a Paramount studio as Norma visits him. It is one of the warmest scenes in the film as DeMille shows paternal kindness to Desmond even if he's being somewhat deceptive - unable to tell her the truth about the film she wants to make. It's also one of the rare moments Norma feels at ease, surrounded by praise and attention - even if some of it is insincere.Director/co-writer Billy Wilder gets so much out of his fine cast. As the main character, Holden draws sympathy as someone acting unethically but whose situation is so desperate, he is easy to understand; as an extremely enabling co-dependent, von Stroheim's Max might be laughable at times but he shows genuine sadness when the collective illusion starts being exposed. His action in the final scene is shocking even if it is genuinely in character; as the story's anchor, Olson manages to bring a sweet charm to the smartest character who can see through all the Hollywood illusions; but Swanson truly stands out in a role who can easily draw laughter, contempt, pity, and sympathy sometimes even simultaneously as a super-egomaniac.It is that final scene that is gripping all the way through and well after the film concludes. In the hands of many other actresses, the scene could have ended up as laughable camp and placed the film in the category of ""so bad, it's good"". But in Swanson's hands, the scene and film end up in the opposite extreme. Her portrayal of insanity is so powerful that it leaves the viewer speechless as it also shatters the belief that Hollywood fame is the ultimate source of happiness. This archetype (a has-been star who still thinks she's famous) was also superbly played twelve years later by Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"".RATING: 10 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Billy WilderScreenplay by Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D.

115,telegonus,Hollywood & Sunset,8,30 October 2001,"Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.",Sunset Blvd.
116,bmacv,Upheaval of gender roles real subject of Wilder's harrowing masterpiece,10,9 September 2002,"Nineteen-fifty proved a spectacular year for Hollywood.  The studios enjoyed maximum power and influence, following a decade of unprecedented numbers of ticket-buyers.  Never again would `The Industry' ride so high, with (among other factors) the advent of television.  And three movies released that year have attained almost scriptural status, at least among acolytes sharing a rarefied if rigorous cinematic faith: All About Eve; Caged; and Sunset Blvd.  All three glitter with brilliant epigrams flashing from the polished facets of their gem-like scripts - lines that have entered the language at large, often quoted in ignorance of their provenance.All About Eve was a theater story but Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. was THE Hollywood Story.  (Caged was a women's prison story; enough said.)  And it is as a myth about movie-making, and the erratic trajectory of stardom, that Sunset Blvd. most frequently merits attention.  But of many movies made about Hollywood, none can claim the peculiar potency of this masterpiece, which can still wring from viewers those old Aristotelian emotions of pity and terror (plus a good deal of unholy fun).Its corrosive force springs from the fact that Sunset Blvd. is, first and foremost, about that oldest and deepest of human preoccupations, gender. It tells of catastrophic upheaval in the long-honored `natural' order of affairs between males and females: A virile young man falls prey to an older, more powerful woman.  His tragedy is not the watery end into which he plummets but the slow and painful process of emasculation to which he has given tacit consent.Ohio newspaperman Joe Gillis (William Holden) went west to make his fortune writing pictures, but he works in his bathrobe in a one-room apartment three months behind in the rent.  His car payments are in arrears, too, so his attempts to elude repo men become the fuse that ignites the plot.  A fatal turn takes him into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard, the Gothic manse where, in wealthy if stifling seclusion, lives legendary queen of the silents Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She grants him asylum, in his view a temporary convenience.  But she has other ambitions.At first those plans seem to be a rather hopeless pipe-dream about returning to the screen, through the vehicle of her screenplay Salome (another cautionary tale of reversed gender roles).  But soon the resourceless Gillis finds himself accepting her largess (a garage apartment, vincuna topcoats, a gold cigarette case inscribed with ""Mad about the boy"") and her control (from `And must you chew gum?"" to `Of course you didn't - I wouldn't let you').  Once Desmond sinks her talons into him - and Swanson's own stint in the silents pay off handsomely, for no one in the sound era ever deployed claws like hers - he finds he cannot leave, even at the cost of his self-esteem and greater happiness.The third character in the movie offers a dress rehearsal of the submissive role Gillis is bound for.  Desmond's Teutonic butler Max (Erich von Stroheim) caters to her every whim and guards her castle of illusions.  In a role suggestive of the male - and generally gay - assistants, publicists and fans who cluster dotingly around female stars, he fusses over girlish details (`Madam will pardon me, but the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced"").As the movie charts its inexorable course, new humiliations and revelations strip layer after layer from Gillis' own illusions.  In a chic haberdashery where Desmond takes him to smarten up his wardrobe, a clerk whispers, ""Well, if the lady is paying, why not take the vicuna?""  (Holden wordlessly reacts with rage and shame.)  And when he sneaks back from what Desmond suspects is a night of tom-catting - he's actually writing a script with a young colleague (Nancy Olson) who's falling for him - the vigilant Max lurks in wait for him.  Challenged by the fed-up Gillis, the butler reveals not only that he discovered Desmond when he was the great auteur Max von Mayerling (Stroheim, of course, was a grandiose director of the silent era), but that he was ""Madam's first husband"" as well.   In the hard-as-ice script by Wilder and Charles Brackett, this stands as, hands down, its chilliest moment.  (By contrast, its sunniest involves Desmond's return to Paramount studios, when a light swings upon her so a new generation of actors and crew can pay homage to her glory.)Sunset Blvd. catalogues the kept-man's degradation to which Gillis acquiesces.  He's moved from chauffeur's quarters to the lavish suite adjoining Desmond's - and from which, owing to Madam's ""fits of melancholy,"" the locks have been removed.  He endures the raised eyebrows of Desmond's bridge partners (Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton) when he interrupts their game to ask for money.  He finds himself as the sole guest (apart from Max and the orchestra) at her New Year's Eve soiree, tangoing on the tile Valentino told her to install, where she finally confesses her love for him.  (As though he never expected this development, he storms out to a raucous party among his young former friends, only to race back after she swipes his razor and succumbs to her melancholia.)  He even lets her towel off his bedewed torso after a dip in the pool she has had filled for him.Desmond, in a nutshell, has taken a scalpel to his manhood long before the final denouement - precipitated by one final, doomed bid for freedom.  And perhaps he prefers the end that he must know awaits him to taking a bus back to Dayton with his tail tucked between his legs.  But fate proves `strangely merciful' to Norma Desmond. In the movie's last, most iconic scene (`I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille'), she once again triumphs under the harsh lights and in front of the clattering cameras.  The full fetch of her looniness at long last unleashed, she gets what she wanted all along: not the boy she was so mad about but the ""return,"" however delusional, she craved.",Sunset Blvd.
117,Richie-67-485852,The Blvd.,8,1 April 2018,"From the fifties to the seventies, Sunset Blvd was the place to go and be. You could cruise it and there were places it could be walked for blocks and nightclubs galore. I even visited an old empty mansion in the hills, broke into it and walked around. Everyone said it was haunted and the police used to come and chase people away. Great night out. Some of that nostalgia is captured in this movie and is in the background as well as theme of the movie. As far as the movie itself goes, it is a good story, well told and acted out to perfection. It presents an older woman using a younger man for her vain and selfish purposes and the man going along with it first out of necessity and later on like an insect in a spider's web. Stuck and no where to go with a hungry female prowling around. Nicely done on this point and the point of everyone coming to Hollywood to struggle until they got recognized for anything and start to make some real money. Schwabs drugstore in the movie was a real hangout too. BTW...when one wasn't on Sunset Blvd they were cruising Hollywood Blvd. There was always some action going on these two streets. Lastly, I got the chills watching this as I had a woman chasing me just like this one chased William Holden (no sex) offering me money, free lunches/dinners and gifts galore if I only devote myself to her. Mind you I am married but it didn't stop this obsessive person including her making me her heir. I even told her off (many times) and she would not let go. Creepy and dysfunctional to say the least. Enjoy this glimpse of real life back then but still happening today here and there and everywhere.... Come and visit ...",Sunset Blvd.
118,classicalsteve,A Young Hollywood Caught in a Movie Time Warp,10,18 April 2021,"NOTE: The following is more of an essay than a review.Hollywood, the physical place, became the center of entertainment productions on a large scale through the use of moving photo frames to tell a story from circa 1910. Soundtracks began being added in 1928, the beginning of the so-called ""talkies"". (""The Jazz Singer"" of 1927 was a hybrid of a silent/talking film.) Very soon, motion pictures (aka movies) became the most popular form of a relatively inexpensive entertainment until the advent of television in the 1940's.Almost from the get-go, the people producing the entertainments quickly realized they were creating a whole new culture. It was no longer just entertainment for entertainment's sake. Viewers began falling in love with some of the characters on screen. They sent letters to the actors and actresses. Some viewers believed that what they were seeing was real. Films became fantasies and the screens were like windows into another world.A large number of female viewers in the 1920's believed Rudolph Valentino was a great lover, even though no one outside of Hollywood knew he was gay. Clark Gable was thought to be a very masculine ladies' man, although he tended to be attracted to bossy dominant women. Betty Davis was thought to be a trouble-maker. John Wayne was believed to be a war hero, but never served for one day in the military. Edward G. Robinson was thought to be a gangster even though in real life he loved fine art and high literature. In other words, the Hollywood studios were also presenting fabrications of sorts.These fantasies provide the set-up for ""Sunset Boulevard"" directed and co-written by Billy Wilder. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-on-his-luck mediocre screenwriter. His main flaw is that he gets too caught up in what he thinks will sell, rather than writing an honest story. Through a couple of strange coincidences he ends up at the manor house of a forgotten movie actress from the silent era, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her ever-loyal servant Max (Erich von Stroheim). She was one of the biggest stars of the silent era of the 1920's, playing in many epic films directed by Cecil B. Demille (who plays himself in the film). However, Hollywood has moved on and the demand for silent period pieces all but over, and she hasn't been cast in a feature film for 20 years.She's writing a bad screenplay based on Salome and she compels Gillis not to help her but reside in her manor. Norma's house appears like a movie set for a period picture taking place in the 19th century: velvet and satin upholstery on sofas, beds and drapery. She wears flowing garments and over-the-top makeup. She displayes dozens of photos of herself, as if her vanity is boundless. She is afterall a ""movie star"" in the old sense of the word, and she should be worshiped and adored. It seems more like a fantasy than a home which is I think the point the director and co-writer Billy Wilder wanted to convey.During the entire film, Norma Desmond seems to be engaged in over-the-top acting. Her interplay with Gillis is constantly melodramatic, as were many of the silent films prior to circa 1928. During the silent era, actors had to convey emotion through their expressions since there was no soundtrack. So by definition, their expressions had to be over-emphasized which seems highly melodramatic by the standards of today. So over and over again, Norma makes grand gestures and pierces Gillis with ever-growing bulging eyes.Her makeup is equally over-the-top, and she appears like a cross between the wicked queen of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and the Wicked Witch of the West. In several scenes we see her face on top of the screen as if she is the ruler of this strange queendom. She is like the wicked queen who has captured a prince. She lavishes him with expensive gifts but Gillis longs to be free of this gilded cage. The price of Gillis imprisonment is his own career. He briefly interacts with a young budding screenwriter, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) but he soon realizes he can't straddle both worlds forever. He has to make a choice between staying in the fantasy of Norma Desmond or returning to the real-world of film-making with Nancy.One of the noir masterpieces of the 20th century, and an indictment of Hollywood culture. Not necessarily for all tastes, the film is one of the first of its kind to openly critique Hollywood culture. Film actors, particularly actresses, were and still are in a way often treated like professional athletes. They are only as good as their last performances. After they've served their purpose and can no longer do so, they're discarded.",Sunset Blvd.
119,hall895,Good but not among the greatest,7,5 July 2015,"Sunset Boulevard is universally acclaimed. It is one of those films which should you dare suggest it is not among the greatest films ever made people think you're an idiot. Well, at the risk of being labeled an idiot, Sunset Boulevard is not among the greatest films ever made. It is a good film, certainly captivating in its own unique, macabre way. But is a film for which reputation outstrips reality.Most everyone is familiar with the story of Sunset Boulevard, that of faded silent film star Norma Desmond. The faded star lives in an equally faded mansion, plotting a comeback which is far-fetched to say the least. Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis stumbles into Norma's bizarre world and, at the price of his dignity, feeds her delusions. A man's gotta make a living and Joe will make his by brushing up the godawful script Norma has written as her comeback vehicle. Joe will soon realize Norma wants him as more than a script doctor. He is to be her lover, a kept man living in her grotesque mansion, surrounded by the relics of Norma's past, reminders of a life which for her is gone forever. Of course in her deluded mind Norma is just as big a star as she ever was. It's the pictures that got small.Gloria Swanson turns in a performance for the ages. Her portrayal of Norma does match the hype, even if the film as a whole may not. The descent into madness is breathtaking to watch. Yes, Swanson is a little over-the-top at times but that is who Norma is. Especially as Norma begins to lose all touch with reality. William Holden, playing Joe, is not bad but certainly not up to the level of Swanson. Joe is a bit of a dry character, he could use some more personality. Holden doesn't make him into as much of a presence as he really needs to be for the film to truly grab you. Erich von Stroheim, playing Norma's ever-faithful butler Max, does have a presence, a quite ominous one. But as we learn more about the character Max becomes less ominous and more sad. It's a sad world Norma Desmond lives in and that sadness grabs everyone who falls under her sway. Joe knows he has to escape. He tries to find happiness with beautiful young Betty Schaefer, with whom he secretly works on a script. But nobody escapes Norma Desmond easily.All in all Sunset Boulevard tells a very sad tale, centered around the quite pitiable Norma Desmond. Norma longs for a world which is forever gone. She won't accept it and nobody will try to make her do so. Max, her only companion before Joe shows up, allows Norma to live in her fantasy world. She retreats so far into her fantasy there is no way back to reality. Norma cannot be saved. She has lost her mind. And despite the fact she does some truly loathsome things you can't help but feel sorry for her. For you saw those moments where the old Norma Desmond shined through, where you could see her for the great star she once was. But those moments are fleeting and ultimately those moments are gone. Only a sad, pathetic shell of Norma Desmond remains. It's a sad journey the character takes, a journey Swanson captures ever so well. You just wish the rest of the film was up to Swanson's standard. Holden can't quite match her. Nancy Olson brings a desperately needed breath of fresh air to the film in playing Betty but the romance between Betty and Joe never fully sparks to life. von Stroheim is memorable in his own way but his character is ultimately almost as sad as Norma. So much sadness in this film. Sunset Boulevard has a captivating story to tell but in the end maybe there is a little too much sadness. And madness. By the end it veers dangerously close to parody. There is much to appreciate about the film but to label it as one of the greatest films ever is to give it more praise than it deserves. It is a good film to be sure. But perhaps upon close examination Sunset Boulevard is not quite ready for its closeup.",Sunset Blvd.
120,sharky_55,I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.,9,29 July 2018,"A dead man narrates Sunset Boulevard, eager to tell us his version of the events, the cold, hard facts, before they are distorted and blown out of proportion by the radio and television screen. Joe Gillis is a writer, and naturally wants his story to retain its integrity. Wilder gives us a witty snapshot of that idea disappearing in a puff of smoke early in the film, where Joe pitches his baseball script to an producer in a dinghy little office. Firstly it's openly mocked by a script reader (the demure yet snappy Nancy Olson) who wants something grandiose and with a message. ""You'd have turned down Gone with the Wind!"" splutters Joe in exasperation. ""No, that was me,"" remarks the producer with resignation. Almost absent-mindedly whilst lounging on the couch, he twists Joe's story into an all-female spectacle with musical interludes, with the screen credit the only remaining vestige of the initial premise. And when Joe pleas for a personal loan, he launches into a spiel about his own spiralling debts that Wilder quickly cuts away from. There's no need for semantics; he's hemorrhaging money, like most of Hollywood, where original ideas are sparse and basic plots are organised by numbers and letters. Joe is played by William Holden, the strapping lead who would go on to star in other blockbusters like The Bridge on the River Kwai and Stalag 17, and who almost allows the audience to forget he is playing the everyman figure in this film, a struggling writer who has exchanged talent for a living. Wilder's dialogue is as biting and cynical as it ever is, delivered from the mouthpieces of two who have been spun around by Hollywood's washing cycle and spit out as nobodies. Joe holds himself up high, whether it is in a shabby blazer or a dinner suit and bow tie, but he has already traded away his artistic integrity. What more is a little self-respect? While he turns his nose at the array of baubles and trinkets that Norma showers him with, it's also a little flattering. His steely gaze hides a begrudging reliance, as does Norma's histrionics, betraying a twisted partnership; they need each other. Both Boulevard and Double Indemnity were photographed by John F. Seitz, who Wilder had entrusted with the latter's moody, noir lighting, and recruited to recapture. The term is French for black, and in a sense they were black both morally and physically. Seitz uses the same technique he did in Indemnity by sprinkling aluminium dust in front of the lens to render the sprawling, gothic mansion of Norma's into a dusty ruin, of luxury in decay. As Joe and Betty collaborate on their script late at night in a discreet motel (practically a synonym for seediness), he keeps the latter in the catch light, an angelic casualty of the wicked world of showbiz, but submerges Holden's face in shadow, like the very nature of his thoughts were being divulged. The guilt of their covert affair consumes him, as if he was in sole ownership of Norma Desmond. Who else but Gloria Swanson could have captured this performance? Norma's demise mirrors Swanson's, once a glittering silent icon, for 6 years the top star of Paramount, and then scuttled by the arrival of sound. The role asks for quiet desperation to be masked by flamboyance, and Norma replies in kind. She is a relic of the past, her costumes elaborate but dated, her poise a touch theatrical, but if she doesn't believe it, it might as well not be true. ""I can say anything I want with my eyes,"" she declares, and sure enough, her pupils bore holes in any eyes who dare meet them, and makes demands, not queries. Cut away from her? Not likely. Norma still believes she commands the screen, and in some respects she does, most evidently in that final trance, where she fully commits to the illusion that has been held up for the last twenty years. But for Joe's brief peek into the enigma that is Norma Desmond, she has been long swallowed by Sunset Boulevard.",Sunset Blvd.
121,johno-21,A collision of two eras,10,11 May 2006,"I've seen this many times. From the moment it was made it was destined to be a classic. William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10.",Sunset Blvd.

It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama? Who cares; just see it.",Sunset Blvd.
123,Stampsfightclub,Excellent representation of the film industry with sharp Swanson,9,19 April 2009,"Down on his luck, screenwriter Joe Gillis (Holden) reluctantly takes a job writing for once famous actress Norma Desmond (Swanson) who is planning her comeback.Made almost 60 years ago Sunset Boulevard was a marvel at the time of release. Winning 3 Oscars and scooping plenty of other nominations, the story of the struggling screenwriter and failed actress has a level of humanity and realism to maintain its timeless classic tag.Oscar nominated William Holden (The Wild Bunch) opens the story by taking viewers back 6 months before a tragic event recalling how he ended up working for the neurotic Norma Desmond, cinemas once finest star. Holden's reflection on society and his desperation to work is charismatic, ensnaring and occasionally funny. The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well. But this charming on screen presence is overshadowed by an obsessive and starry-eyed portrayal of fame by Gloria Swanson as the unforgivably self obsessed actress.With the film world growing bigger each year we see more actors come and go and get lost in a whirlwind of controversy off camera. Gossip magazines are more concerned with the battles with diet and appearance and frankly it's amazing to see this depicted in a film made in the 1950's. Swanson is the symbol of today's modern stereotype. Once the star she descends into a world of obscurity and absentmindedness, lost in past glory before seeing the light and preparing herself for her comeback. ""I'm ready for my close up Mr DeMille"" is an unforgettable line and still remains powerful, with the performance stealing the scenes.The story itself representing the struggle of writing and surviving for the film industry is consistently accurate and interesting. The power of the bosses, the struggle of independent writers and penning the greatest novel ever reveal the desire and controversy of the industry.The inclusion of issues such as desire, lust, suicide and money add to the realism of Billy Wilder's acclaimed picture.Wilder chooses scenes carefully, maintain enough realism to make an almost fantasy about the story. The swimming pool scene and Norma's last scene are testament to the concept of madness of the film industry. This, from all the films I have seen, has one of the finest rounded off endings ever screened, perfectly pitched, entertaining and justification to the film's preaching morals of madness and the powers of film.The inclusion of an affair and a secret long lost crush add to the depth and drama of the film, which makes Sunset Boulevard packed with fine preaching issues, stunning acting and enough drama and interest to keep you hooked right until a stunning end",Sunset Blvd.

Von Stroheim directed her IRL, plus in this movie he was one of her early directors as well as her first husband. As Max, he seemed to have a very proper Teutonic view of the world, only to find out he really cared for Norma. I could see a heart of gold beneath his brusque exterior.Holden luscious at the age he made this movie. He essayed quite well the part of poverty row writer, desperate enough to get snared into the clutches of a wealthy female hermit ex-silent movie star.Swanson did well the gamut from almost sane to quite the dizzy dame to the insane mindless and pathetic dame, all the while trying to seduce Joe Gillis (Holden).Good for Joe wanting to give up the 18 suits (I wonder if he had as many ties as did Richard Gere in ""American Gigolo""). In the end of ""Sunset Blvd."", Joe had a pathetic exit that repeated the theme of its beginning -- sort of an endless loop.Good to see C.B. De Mille.15/10.",Sunset Blvd.
125,jluis1984,Masterpiece,10,4 June 2007,"The city of Hollywood, California, as the historical center of the American movie industry, has been a place of fantasies and fascinations since the first film producers decided to move there in 1913. Most of this almost supernatural mystique that has impregnated the city since those days was a direct result of the economic bonanza of the ""Roaring Twenties"" and the creation of the ""star system"", imposed by the major film studios in the early years Hollywood's Golden Age. The myths and legends of classic Hollywood would soon be exported to the world, and became an enormous influence for an Austrian young writer named Samuel ""Billy"" Wilder. Wilder would later move to America after the rise of the Nazi regime, and started a promising career at Hollywood, the very place of his dreams of youth. The opulence and decadence of the city inspired Wilder to write and direct a legendary movie in 1950: ""Sunset Boulevard"".""Sunset Boulevard"" is the story of two persons, writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) and former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose lives will coincide on Sunset Blvd. and will never be the same again. As a scriptwriter, Gillis has not been lucky for a while, and finally finds himself hunted by two repossession agents who expect him to pay for his car. In his attempt to flee, Gillis hides his car in an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. However, the mansion is not deserted, and inside he mets the owner, the legendary film star Norma Desmond, who has faded into obscurity after the arrival of sound movies. After she discovers Gillis is a writer, she offers to hire him so he can help her with a script she has been writing for her comeback to cinema. Gillis accepts, thinking it's an easy way to earn fast money, but soon he'll discover that nothing comes off that easily, specially on Sunset Blvd.While the movie is definitely Wilder's brainchild, the script was written with the help of his usual collaborator, Charles Brackett; and former film critic D.M. Marshman Jr., who was hired by Wilder and Brackett to help them develop the plot. The story follows the classic film noir pattern, but soon it is obvious that this movie goes beyond any genre conventions as it adds touches of horror, drama and black comedy in the most unmerciful critique to the decadence of Hollywood's Golden Age. The way the writers develop the characters is simply perfect in all its cynic realism, as while the characters are not without a touch of grotesque, they still look and feel so real that just enhance the horror and tragedy of this twisted tale about the dark side of Hollywood. Filled with fascinating characters, carefully placed details and a wonderful tale of madness, the script for ""Sunset Blvd."" is definitely one of the finest ever written.As if writing a monumental screenplay wasn't enough, Wilder also excels as a director in this masterpiece, bringing his script to life in a haunting and beautiful way. Just like he did 6 years before with ""Double Indemnity"", once again Wilder reinvents the film noir genre thanks to the amazing cinematography by John F. Seitz, who captures the darkness of Norma Desmond's life with his heavily atmospheric film noir photography. His care for details and references to old Hollywood extend beyond his screenplay and populate the film in more than one way (the inspired use of cameos by real former silent-film stars for example), adding a great amount of authenticity and realism to the movie. Finally, the performances he managed to get from his main cast are simply some of the best done in an American movie.Many has already been said about the outstanding performance done by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but I can't help but commenting on the extraordinary level of perfection she achieved on her role. In her eerily autobiographical character (Desmond's past resembled Swanson's career in some ways), Swanson transforms herself in the vivid incarnation of the twisted mirror image of Hollywood's life, creating a larger than life character that gave her a much deserved praise. In his breakthrough role, William Holden makes an excellent subtle and witty counterpart to Swanson's over-the-top character, and despite facing extraordinary actors in this wild ride through Hollywood, he never disappoints and proves to be up to the challenge. Finally, legendary director Erich Von Stroheim appears as Norma's stoic butler, and adds a haunting aura of dignity to the movie with the powerful presence of his acting.Despite being a powerful criticism to the studio system and a brutal deconstruction of the Hollywood myths, ""Sunset Blvd."" is also a fond love letter to the movies that resulted from it, and specially to the artists behind them (The cameos by director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson are a testament of this); as while tragic and pathetic, there is a certain sweetness and humanity in the characters that makes this set of old Hollywood ghouls to be so charming despite their madness. While not without flaws (Nancy Olson's performance feels uninspired when compared to the rest of the cast), ""Sunset Blvd."" is one of those movies that truly deserves its status as ""classic"", as thanks to Wilder's direction and the cast's performances, it reaches the closest a film can be to perfection.Time magazine described the film as the story of ""Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best"", and that's probably the best way to describe the haunting story of Norma Desmond in ""Sunset Blvd."". Like the famous street that gives the movie its name, Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Blvd."" has developed a powerful mystique around it, but that's just because in the course of its destruction of Hollywood's illusions, the movie made them even more real. 10/10",Sunset Blvd.
126,krorie,Like Norma Desmond this film has not aged well but still packs a wallop,8,26 December 2005,"Not quite the shocker it was in 1950, ""Sunset Blvd."" still packs a wallop. For most director/writers ""Sunset Blvd."" would have been the height of their careers, their masterpiece, but for multi-talented Billy Wilder there were better pictures. ""Double indemnity,"" ""The Apartment,"" ""Some Like It Hot,"" and two highly underrated films ""Ace in the Hole"" and ""One, Two, Three"" are better written than ""Sunset Blvd."" Take off the tinsel and the viewer will find some cracks in ""Sunset Blvd."" One distraction is the narration by the body floating in the swimming pool. There's a cliché that dead men tell no tales. Well, a dead man tells one hell of a tale in this film. The movie takes forever to get to the essence of the story. It gets better and better as the movie progresses until it explodes at the end. The best scene in the whole film is the last scene when Norma Desmond gives what amounts to a soliloquy for the newsreel cameras. Some critics have labeled this a dark comedy. There is really not much that is funny in the film. Calling it a dark melodrama is more apropos. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a dark comedy. Dark comedies make a person laugh at subject matter such as death and weapons of mass destruction that would ordinarily be taken very seriously. A good dark comedy also makes one think. ""A Modest Proposal"" by Jonathan Swift is an example of dark comedy at its highest level. Though ""Sunset Blvd."" certainly makes the viewer think, its punch comes from the drama of contradiction and social analysis, not in its humor.The film has a few other weaknesses but let's look at the tinsel. What tinsel! All the actors give magnificent performances. The best among the great is Erich von Stroheim. It's easy to forget what a wonderful actor von Stroheim was until one sees him in action. It is also rewarding to see Jack Webb in a non-tough cop or punk hood role. One forgets that he was a serious actor before ""Dragnet"" stereotyped him. William Holden gives one of his best screen performances. Gloria Swanson is just whom Wilder needed to pull off the extraordinary acting required for her role, plus she was the real McCoy so one of her silent films could actually be used to intensify the allegory. One of the best lines in the film is delivered by Cecil B. DeMille. He has pampered Norma, telling her what she wants to hear. But as she is leaving and out of earshot, he reverts to his true attitude toward the faded screen goddess. ""Tell Gordon Cole to forget about the car. I'll buy him another, or even five if he likes."" In the viewer's mind DeMille is talking about Norma, not cars. To my knowledge this is the first Hollywood film to deal seriously with the subject of Narcissism in the industry. Narcissism applies to Thespians but also to any person in a position of power. Narcissistic personalities simply cannot deal with life outside the limelight. They must have mass adoration at any price. If you haven't seen ""Sunset Blvd."" by all means watch it and form your own conclusion. It is certainly one of Wilder's best.",Sunset Blvd.

128,sjanders-86430,Hollywood on the chopping block,10,22 January 2021,"Gloria Swanson is only 50 when Sunset Boulevard was filmed. But she's a has been even though she looks great. Cecil DeMille much older than she is still working. The script cuts the Hollywood glamour to a number that says young actresses only. This film should have won Best Picture, but the Oscar Board didn't give it, because the whole film industry was shown for the cruel town that it really is.
William Holden should have won an Oscar and didn't. Gloria Swanson should have won an Oscar and didn't.
I have one criticism of the plot. The locks had been taken off the doors. Under the careful watch of Von Stroheim, how did Swanson get hold of a loaded gun?
I loved when Von Stroheim played the organ with those white gloves he never took off. I loved when Gloria played Charlie Chaplin. I loved when she and Holden watched her silent films. The Isotta Frachetta car they drove around was also wonderful.
Swanson's walk down the staircase with the lights, cameras rolling, and of course us sitting in the dark watching captures the core of all Hollywoods' glory and tragedy. She let the dream enfold her says Holden the narrator from beyond the grave.
Billy Wilder used narrators in his films, because it saved time to have someone explaining things.",Sunset Blvd.

Meaning, some people will appreciate it, but others will find it hell to sit through. Painfully slow at times and just plain old aged it really takes a good understanding that this is an older film to appreciate it. The central message - a look at the Hollywood film making system, which caused loads of controversy at the time of initial release - remains interesting, especially for movie enthusiasts and film makers, but if you are just looking for a good classic thriller from director Billy Wilder, ""Double Indemnity"" would be a safer choice.After the intriguing opening, many of the scenes in the center film drag on and the atmosphere is much less than desired from what you'd expect from such a film.

130,FilmOtaku,Another Billy Wilder masterpiece,9,11 April 2004,"I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.  It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly",Sunset Blvd.
131,RResende,"inside, outside reality",10,5 February 2007,"This is fantastic writing, great story folding, and very successful in the way it uses the ""form"" to provide us, the audience, with a meaning. It may not be the first self-referential movies in history but it is for sure one of the first intelligent ones.Possible spoilers herein. So, what we get is films within the film. The film is what we, the audience, see. In order to really make it look like afilm, we hear the off-voice of the corpse (narrator), even when the corpse is being shown to us. A dead man describing himself as dead (the original intention was to place the speaking corpse in a morgue). Inside this clearly constructed film we find some others. To know:. -the projection of Queen Kelly, the film directed by Stroheim (who plays the projector in our film) and starred by Swanson, our actress playing an retired actress.Demille's picture, real event, it was happening at the time. DeMille plays himself. i'll get here ahead. Salome. The picture about a mad woman, the leitmotif of our film is the development of this film. The very awareness of the history of Salome will lead us to the events of our Sunset Boulevard.This is what we see. Films within films. What do they mean?: Practically every character in the film plays in the picture his status in real life:. Holden, playing the broke writer was himself having a down moment in his career. Olson, playing the ambitious potential writer was herself a struggling actress at this moment. The ""wax figures"" appear as themselves as retired ""used to be"" stars. The best comes with Stroheim and Swanson. Queen Kelly represented, at the time of its making, a huge polemic film that was no good for Swanson's career, and eventually ruined Stroheim's Its projection, by Stroheim, and the pantomime in our sunset boulevard, by Swanson, adds to its decadence feeling. DeMille also worked with Swanson, in Sunset Boulevard he is not talking to any character, he is talking to her. Obviously she was not in real life the character she portrays, but deMille talks to the real people, not the character.This is a highly intelligent and complex construction, that strikes us as a simple one. Chabrol starts his ""how to make a picture"" book by saying that if you're about to make a film, you've got to have a reason. In here it's crystal clear, the reasons. The critics to Hollywood decadent society, through drawing the turning line between two worlds. Wilder uses the relations with real true (outside films) and delivers us something that may be faced as an ambiguous world, inside and outside our real world. Films, and our lives are made of those things.The criticism it depicts are useless, dated, and a mere curiosity today, but this stands as a very clever construction and, therefor, a worth seeing picture.My evaluation: 4/5",Sunset Blvd.
132,elvircorhodzic,"""You heard him. I'm a star.""",10,9 September 2016,"SUNSET BOULEVARD is a bit outrageous and chaotic drama that can be called a masterpiece. Characterization is phenomenal. The former silent film star resists aging and draws youth from a young, unsuccessful and somewhat cynical young screenwriter. The story is full of ambition, frustration and lies, which is fascinating. The main theme is the transience of life under the lights of Hollywood cameras. The film is full of satire and a kind of sarcasm.The story can not encircle the specified time period. This is a strange blend of true past and present false. The future in this story is practically nonexistent . The script is good, but the photo is simply mesmerizing. The false glamour and glamour without life is ideal for this story. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond It is simply amazing, for me it is inconceivable to see any other actress in this role. William Holden as Joseph C.

Character for whom I feel a certain empathy, but I can not admire him.Frustrated writer used the opportunity to earn some money, but at the same time meet the needs of older actress. Fortunately, it's not so simple. The story can be viewed through lack of self-esteem, contrived romance, external pressure, psychopathic nature and defeat at the end. Romance is very interesting. However, at times it is uncomfortable. Excellent dialogues are transferred in real relationships. Therefore act unnaturally. The atmosphere is reflected in the amazing and elegant past that is falling apart at present.Sunset Boulevard is a very intelligent movie. How to create intimacy of an actor or actress loses from commercial success. This world glamour remains in the film. Everything else is a lie. The truth is so painful that endangers lives.

""Sunset"" has remained an American movie classic more than 50 years later and has stood the test of time. At the time of its release, it was somewhat of a controversial and modern film, ahead of its time. Billy Wilder got away with essentially criticizing and satirizing the Hollywood film industry with the cynical and darkly comical ""film noir"" story of the tragic silent film diva Norma Desmond, magnificently portrayed by Gloria Swanson, herself a former silent film star. Not the least bit worried that she was basically parodying herself, Swanson and other silent film era stars- Swanson's former director Erich Von Stroheim, Buster Keaton, Ray Evans, Anna Q. Nilsson, even Cecil B. De Mille himself- take part in this unforgettable classic. Set in 1950's Hollywood/LA, struggling, down-on-his luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) avoids the car impound guys by hiding in a secluded mansion, the owner who is none other than Norma Desmond, once a big silent film star. Now she lives in a creepy, deteriorating mansion with the sinister-looking butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim). When Norma offers Joe the chance to make money writing her film script for ""Salome"" which she hopes will be her come-back movie, he accepts without knowing what he is getting himself into. Before long, Norma falls for him and becomes possessive of him, keeping him in her mad world where time has not passed her by. But Joe manages to sneak off in order to work on a script, with the equally intelligent screenwriter Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) who was formerly engaged to studio hand Artie Green (Jack Webb) but who eventually falls for Joe. When Norma discovers the relationship, jealousy gets the best of her, with tragic results for Joe. Both William Holden and Gloria Swanson have terrific chemistry and their performances earned them an Oscar nomination. This is actually Bill Holden's first important film and he would make one great film after another following this. So much to admire. The witty script full of great lines- ""I'm still big, it's the pictures that got smaller"", ""I'm ready for my close-up Mr. De Mille"", the cameo by Hollywood gossip writer Hedda Hopper and De Mille's own presence, the superb music by Franz Waxman and the subtle symbolism to be found everywhere, with one theme alone- death. Norma's career is dead and she wishes to revive it, Joe is in a state of death as a screenwriter and hopes to somehow to rekindle his writing prowess, Norma's dead monkey early in the film is a stand-in for Joe himself, who figuratively becomes her monkey and one who dies at the end of the film. The film is absolutely wonderful and this is the type of film that can never get old, despite the melodramatic quality, which, fortunately, is countered by solid dialog and a powerful attack on Hollywood society. Was the fate of silent film stars or older stars to fade away into obscurity and madness when a new wave of films and actors comes along ? The story of Norma Desmond may in fact be the real life story of silent film star Mary Pickford is truthfully a bit tragic. She tried to transition into talkies but was unsuccessful (like Norma Desmond) and in her old age she isolated herself in her big mansion and faded away. There are very little films like this nowadays. Of interesting note, this film inspired the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and this musical will be made into a movie starring Glenn Close set to be released in 2008.",Sunset Blvd.
134,CountZero313,how the pictures got small,10,4 December 2010,"A cash-strapped screenwriter, aiming to save his car from re-possession, stumbles into the crumbling mansion of an aging diva of the silent film era, Norma Desmond. Financial opportunity opens up, but at the same time personal dignity, a writing career, and more purist romantic opportunities begin to recede. And the workings of the Hollywood machine are laid bare in the process.If Sunset Boulevard were merely an expose of Hollywood machinations, it would occupy a niche nestling next to entertaining, but ultimately navel-gazing celluloid output such as The Player or Bowfinger. The fact that the film is an all-time classic tells you it resonates with universal themes, of identity, fulfillment, ambition, and love and all its compromises. William Holden is the cynic/dreamer writer Joe Gillis, self-assured in his contempt for Dayton, Ohio, but racked with self-doubt about his status in Hollywood. That ambivalence makes him easy prey for Norma, a veteran at 50 of an industry that has moved on without her on board. 'Eccentric' is an adjective reserved for the wealthy who are insane, and it is money, and the adulation of servant-with-a-secret Max, that keeps Norma from the gates of the Funny Farm.Gloria Swanson as Norma is electrifying; terrifying and pitiful, and utterly compelling. The excesses of the performance, seen in isolation, suggest an actress aiming at camp, but synthesized into the overall narrative are a portrait of a bipolar personality veering towards total self-annihilation. The younger lover, like her own movies that she screens constantly, allow her the illusion that time has not ravaged her life. It is an illusion her own ambitious craving for more screen time will destroy. Holden quite simply oozes cynicism and compromise. Erich von Stroheim, as Max, gives a performance of single-mindedness, his own devotion to Norma outstripping even her own egotistical self-delusions. Even Cecil B. DeMille manages to play himself straight, resisting the urge to wink at the audience, so that cameo does not come into it.Wilder directs boldly, setting his stall out from the off with a layered vision of a dead man in a pool, staring into the void, prodded at by police officers and photographers. An awareness of the interconnectivity between the cast, crew, characters and contemporary Hollywood history certainly adds spice to the viewing experience. However, Sunset Boulevard is an epic even when encountered purely in terms of the narrative contained within its 118 minutes running time. Cinematic storytelling at its finest.",Sunset Blvd.
135,vostf,Dark Side Tinseltown. A compelling and self-concerned Noir,9,22 January 2002,"By 1950 television was beginning to curtail the industry's power. Was it so palpable yet as to arouse nostalgia in some scripts? Sunset Blvd., All about Eve then The Bad and the Beautiful head that trend which reaches a peak with the far more buoyant Singing in the Rain.Someone noticed that at last Hollywood was having a self-critical look after years of light-in/light-out entertainment. I am usually quite tough on people who just find some deep thought movies -such as Kubrick's- too distressing. With Sunset Blvd it's different: it's a Noir movie about Hollywood, Stardom, aging. In fact aging is the dominant theme here compared with the rest and it's a pity. Aging is a very serious and rich theme but it's more a philosophical one than a cinematographical one. Among the many movies about aging I saw each had a very interesting and creative viewpoint (I would recommend La Fin du Jour for instance) but they can't go higher than the down-to-earth tragedy of old people. Still Lives are for painters and no great painter ever devoted too many frames to Vanity. Perhaps when you're getting older, losing your hair -many years from now you'd say- those touching frames become a little more intimate with you.Sunset Blvd. aims to be a typical Noir movie: it was very much fashionable by then. The script is very well written this way but with the benefit of hindsight I found at least one thing is too much. The voice over from beyond the grave: just to think of what was previously planned (see trivia: the deleted morgue scene) makes me nostalgic about that all too thriving creativity Hollywood still had. All things considered I don't hold it to be a masterpiece since the aging theme -that is great Gloria Swanson- takes too much attention as compared with the noir hero. Poor script writer! Always at a loss for words in the industry of moving pictures!",Sunset Blvd.
136,RJBurke1942,Sunset Boulevard: where dreams are made and where dreams also fade...,10,1 September 2006,"Introspection is good for the soul, at least some of the time: we all need to look at ourselves, from time to time, just to see where we're at. Unhappily, sometimes, we don't like what we see in ourselves  and maybe that's what Billy Wider was thinking of when he decided to make this movie, arguably one of the finest Hollywood movies about Hollywood ever made and still listed high in the Top Hundred Films.But, Billy Wilder and the cast didn't know that when shooting the film, nor did they know it would win three Academy Awards. But there's no doubt that Wilder knew that he was breaking new ground. According to Gloria Swanson, Wilder knew ""full well that such a script, about Hollywood's excesses and neuroses, was bound to give the Hollywood people acting in it healthy doubts, about the material or about themselves, depending on their individual security"" (1) Incidentally, Bill Holden wasn't the first choice to play Joe Gillis, the cynical script-writer: that part was supposed to go to a young Montgomery Clift, but he didn't like the idea of playing opposite a much older woman!In one of the most imaginative openings in cinema, the film begins with the dead Joe Gillis telling the story as he lay floating, face down, in the swimming pool at Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson) decrepit mansion on Sunset Boulevard; the camera angle from below, showing his gaping eyes and mouth, is unsurpassed to this day, in my opinion. How does Joe Gillis get there? Would you believe it all starts with his need to get a few hundred dollars to keep the skip-tracers away from his automobile, seeing as how Joe is way behind in his payments?Leaving them in a tangle of lies  something that Joe, we learn, is very good at  he accidentally finds himself in the grounds of a mansion owned by a silent-screen star, now living as a virtual recluse on Sunset Boulevard. Ever the opportunist, Joe finagles himself into a job  another thing that he desperately needs  conning the old bag into believing that he can rework her come-back script into the next Hollywood blockbuster, and all for five hundred dollars a week. In Hollywood, money can buy anything and everything, and Joe proved he was no slouch, pounding his typewriter to try and salvage something from Norma's overblown epic.But, after a few weeks of work, a funny thing happens on the way to see the director, in this case, the very famous and very real Cecil B. de Mille: Joe gets an attack of conscience, sort of, after finding out that the studio doesn't want her script  they just want to hire her old Isotta Fraschini open touring car with leopard-skin upholstery for some B movie! So Joe has to string her along, let her believe that her script just needs a bit more work and keep her happy. Well, the money's great and Norma just wants to keep buying presents for him, so why should Joe complain? Why indeed?But all good things come to an end, in the end. Just when Joe thinks he doing great on a new script that he's writing with his best friend's girl friend, Nancy Olson (Betty Schaeffer), Norma decides that she's fallen in love with Joe and won't let him go. That's big trouble for Joe, because he's fallen in love with Nancy and knows that he can't have either of them: Norma's just a meal ticket to him, and Nancy, well... she's his best friend's girl. And you never steal your best friend's girl, do you? Especially in Hollywood! Such irony...So, what does any heel do when up against the wall? Kiss the girls and run, of course. Only, he doesn't know where to crawl to, except away, maybe back to Ohio  his Hollywood dreams shattered  back to that lousy desk job at the local newspaper, and suffer the snickers and sneers from the creeps he thought he'd left forever...Anyway, Joe thinks he doing them both a favor as he packs his bags and tells Norma she's better off without him. Such chivalry! Only, he didn't realize, the schmuck, that there's nothing worse than a woman scorned  and one that has a gun. And it's pointed at his back, as he walks away, dejected, disheartened and disgusted, finally, with himself. Such is death, and for Joe, mercifully, it comes quickly as Norma shoots him down in crazed despair. Not for nothing is Hollywood called The Dream Factory.Ably supported by a bevy of real Hollywood players and producers, I still rate this as the definitive story about tinsel town and how it corrupts and destroys. Oh, it's been done again, sort of, with The Player (1992; directed by Robert Altman) and by David Lynch with his psychological masterpiece, Mulholland Drive (2001), but it all started with this one.You owe it to yourself to see it.

It is an impressive house but it looks as if it hasn't been touched since Norma's era of stardom. It serves as Norma's shrine to herself full of pictures to herself. It acts as her place of solace from the real world which has long since forgotten her. Her butler Max encourages this and is the one responsible for Norma not coming out of her comfort zone.I think the fact that the Academy wasn't kind to the film could have been more to the sexual abnormality of the relationship but the film is highly critical of the social aspects of the industry. We do feel some pity for Norma because the idea of stardom has driven her to hell. The public ate her up and spit her out. It depicts Hollywood and its audience as fickle, loving a star but also loving to see that star fail. Only through murder is Norma able to get back into the spotlight. The character of Betty has to mutilate her face with a nose job to get that screen test which doesn't result in a job. The main criticism though is the fact that it portrays Norma as being anyone within the business. Joe remarks that he knew that many stars lived in the extravagant mansions . Norma's biography follows matches that of so many stars of yesteryear and today, multiple marriages,inability to accept criticism, living in extravagances, and yet all ways yearning for more rather than being content with the fame and fortune they have been given.The film noir elements within ""Sunset Boulevard"" are very obvious throughout the film to the point where they scream at you. The most striking is the relationship between the predatory femme fatale and the man who can't quite grasp the full scenario until it's too late. It was an easy choice for Billy Wilder to shoot the picture in black and white. The atmosphere of the picture simply wouldn't be as effective if it was shot in color. It is a film noir picture as well and you can't get the same shadowy and dark effect in color. I think as an audience member it captures the finest of the visual style of film noir particularly with the setting of Norma's mansion. I think it might have had more camp if it were filmed in Technicolor. Throughout the picture Gloria Swanson skates so close to being campy and over the top that it takes time to fully let the performance sink in and make an assessment of it. There were times I felt like laughing and there were times I was genuinely impressed by her ability. Shooting Norma in color I think would take away. She is all ways in lavish clothing and is said to look gaudy under layers of make-up and I just think Wilder and Swanson would get the wrong reaction in color. She is scarier in the black dresses and the make-up highlighting her wrinkles and I think she would appear campy if she had color, even darker colors in her face and wardrobe. Seeing her in color well just would make the character not as effective.Here is my main gripe with the picture, the ending/beginning, I think it drastically hinders the narrative. In ""Double Indemnity"" we have a viable reason for our character to be telling his story of murder , but how is it plausible for a dead man to tell a story? It just stretches the realm of believability too far. The shot of William Holden's floating corpse makes for a very powerful visual but it is over the top for him to talk from beyond the grave. Wilder took a leap of faith here and I didn't buy it. Another factor that makes this ending/beginning not work is the fact that it ruins the surprise. We all ready know the pinnacle of how mad Norma is. The picture becomes a matter of us waiting for her to reach her breaking point rather than having us wonder what that breaking point is. William Holden's character could have told the story before his final confrontation with Norma.In the famous ending the police convince Norma to come down by convincing her that production has finally begun on her dream project. Norma thinks the cameras are for her picture but they are just the newsreels out to exploit her at her lowest. We as the audience get a certain satisfaction in seeing her in this pathetic state. We really haven't changed much since Sunset Blvd., the only thing we love more than a star is to see the star crash and burn.",Sunset Blvd.
138,Dan1863Sickles,"Up To Date, Disturbing And Powerful, Despite A Few Dated Elements",10,27 January 2010,"Do you want to be disturbed?Are you ready for a clammy, ice-cold classic that's relentlessly sad, chilling and upsetting? Try SUNSET BOULEVARD.Where else can you find a movie that starts -- actually starts -- with the main character being dragged out of a swimming pool dead? And then, the poor dope spends two hours telling you how he lost his job, his career, his girl friend, his self respect, and his life. But he got that swimming pool he always wanted.It's horrible to watch Joe Gillis lose everything. William Holden gives his character so much smarts and charm, you just can't believe he can be snuffed out so easily. But that's what Hollywood does -- and the message is that if it can happen to Joe, it can happen to anyone.On the other hand, Norma Desmond is truly a fiend out of hell. Gloria Swanson will never be equaled in her courage, playing a woman who is more repulsive and hateful than any modern serial killer or hatchet wielding maniac. And yet all she wants is to go on being young and beautiful forever, sharing the magic of her stardom with ""those wonderful people out there in the dark!"" And the message is, if this monster is what's in front of the camera, who knows how many other monsters are out there -- in the dark? At the heart of this movie is an intriguing contradiction. On the one hand, the chilling madness of Norma Desmond is as real and modern as the ghastly antics of the late Michael Jackson. (Funeral for a chimpanzee, anyone?) On the other hand, the anguish of Joe Gillis at being ""kept"" by an older woman is almost (and I do mean almost) too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involved in the story.Consider how this story would play if the gender roles were reversed. What if Norma Desmond were a tough, male Western star of the silents -- someone like legendary stuntman/cowpoke Tom Mix. And what if the young screenwriter were a pretty young woman with a cheerful, irreverent, upbeat personality, sort of like Carole Lombard or Katherine Hepburn? If the two of them got together it would seem sweet, romantic, not repulsive and chilling. Particularly if the eager young female helped him to get over the death of a beloved wife, or maybe his horse.The point is, no one would be horrified if a 50 something male star seduced a bright young woman in her late twenties or thirties. In fact it would be regarded as rather romantic by a lot of people.A lot of the ""horror"" of SUNSET BOULEVARD comes from an unthinking assumption -- that women with money and power are unnatural creatures and that they can only attract younger men through evil and manipulation. And there's also the double standard that a woman over 50 is no damned good to a man, but a man over 50 is still in his prime.One final thought: William Holden had a wonderful career well into his seventies, and deservedly so. One of his last great performances was in THE WILD BUNCH, where he plays an aging outlaw named Pike Bishop. Note that Pike has the same basic concerns as Norma Desmond. Have I outlived my era? Can I still command respect? What was my life worth? Yet Pike's struggles to pull off one last job are not only not laughed at -- they're rendered as poignant, admirable, and unbelievably heroic. Pike plays the kind of noble, courageous life-giving elder whose wisdom and humanity -- and even his violent tragic death -- simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community.That's the kind of part a mature actress should be able to play as well!",Sunset Blvd.

140,yenlo,Hollywoods best about Hollywoods worst.,9,20 August 1999,"Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Erich von Stroheim star in this Billy Wilder cinematic masterpiece about an aging essentially forgotten silent film star who has delusions about returning to pictures. Made in 1950 this film will capture the viewer each time it is seen. The references to the bygone silent movie era are somehow chilling. Much like when a person walks around ancient Rome or Egypt wondering how something so powerful and advanced could come to an end. Both Swanson and Stroheim were of course giants during the silent film years and their performances is this great movie even seem to show their perhaps real life animosity toward talking films. Holden as Joe Gillis a rapidly becoming down on his like screen writer who stumbles into Swansons world is fantastic. This is certainly one motion picture that could never and should never be remade or colorized, as the Black and White photography is brilliant. It didn't make AFI's top five of all time and perhaps should have.

141,gigan-92,"""Intimate, isn't it?""",10,13 October 2011,"One of the first films to truly shed light on the true nature of world behind cinema was Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950). It was already the tendency of film noir to be rather bleak in its portrayal of human nature, but this movie almost seemed to point the gun at itself. Despite a few critics, the movie is hailed for its uncompromising tale that of which concerns the two leads, William Holden as the out-of-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis and the fallen star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. The grisly story that follows is one of desperation, deceit and of course twisted love. The film achieves this thru its ominous film noir style-cinematography and well done characterization.As the story progresses, it crushes and grinds her dreams without a second glance. The real side of the Hollywood Star System is that actors and actresses all have specific niches, and once that role has been completed and used up, their use usually comes to an end. After a certain extent of glamour, no matter how beautiful the reign, it can never really last forever. The film also displays the cold reality of the world, through the natural tendency of human beings to forsake others. Only in madness, did anyone turn their cameras back on Norma Desmond, and only in death did anyone truly miss the one-shot writer Joe Gillis. Not only that, but the love story between him and Betty Schaefer (played by Nancy Olson) ends rather sadly, before he even meets his own more pressing tragedy. As always in film noir, fate is cruel and seemingly random. It is thru the beautiful cinematography and shadowy characters that Billy Wilder uncovers the truth of a world that before had seemed purely idealistic and welcoming.",Sunset Blvd.

144,melvelvit-1,Psycho Sunset,10,16 May 2008,"When trying to deconstruct something as complex as SUNSET BLVD., sometimes less is more as in the case of Lee Server's quip from ""The Big Book Of Noir"": 'Wilder's staggering Hollywood Gothic. A kind of melding of Raymond Chandler and the Brothers Grimm.' Whether SUNSET BLVD. is ""noir"" or not has divided aficionados for years for some strange reason. It is, of course -it's one of the darkest- but much more so when one considers that Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) is a slyly distorted doppelganger of the Wilder. Consider this: Both Norma & Norman are delusional recluses hiding from the outside world in crumbling old mansions. The two tarnished heroes, Joe Gillis & Marion Crane, are both outside convention (a gigolo & a thief), both are on the run (the law & the repo men), both have unforeseen events happen on the road (a rainstorm & a blow-out) which lead them to the spider- webs of demented couples (Norma & Max, Norman & Mother) and neither of them make it out alive. Their watery death connection is also unmistakable: Joe in a pool, Marion in a shower tub. The two final close-up mad scenes mirror each other as well -the skull superimposed over Norman's face is very similar to the demented rictus grin of Norma's fade-out. There's more, of course. In addition to the dark vs. light between the spider webs and the outside world, I noticed: 1) Joe Gillis is put up in a guest-room over the garage just outside the mansion. Marion Crane is put up in Cabin #1 in the no-tell motel just outside the mansion. 2) It was money that had Joe & Marion on the run and running into the spider's webs. It was their sexuality (Norma & Norman were attracted to them) that got them killed. 3) Norman & Max are volunteers for their own private traps and act as caretakers to their obsessions. 4) Dead, stuffed birds hover on the periphery during Marion's introduction to Norman and a dead, stuffed monkey introduces Joe to Norma. 5) The first we see of the living Joe Gillis is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of the Alto Nido apartments. The first we see of Marion Crane is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of a downtown Phoenix hotel. 6) Just moments before their violent end, both Joe Gillis & Marion Crane took a good look at themselves and made the final decision to ""come clean"" (in Marion's case, literally, in the shower): Joe was leaving Hollywood/Norma and going back to the mid-West and Marion was returning to Phoenix to make amends. ***This aspect makes these two film the blackest of noir! 7) Betty Schafer & Lila Crane went into the spider's web to investigate and got the shock of their lives. Lila's sister was dead and Joe Gillis was gone from Betty's life forever. Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that PSYCHO was his ""little black joke"" and now I have to wonder if the ""joke"" wasn't a clever SUNSET BLVD. redux. Hmmm...",Sunset Blvd.
145,RossRivero99,The best movie of 1950,10,15 July 2014,"Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the very suspenseful look at a screenwriter who doesn't have enough money (played by William Holden)and a silent star named Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) who has been waiting to get into the motion picture business for a long time wanting to make a film that she wanted Cecil B. DeMille to direct but had a terrible script. The film was suspenseful because we want to know why she was really that crazy, but her performance was still well done thanks to memorable lines, for example the most selfish line in the movie in the beginning where she says to Joe Gillis in her bedroom ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small, and the last line in the movie which is the most memorable line in the movie when she was filming in her house and the last line ""All right Mr. DeMille I'm ready for my closeup."". When Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote the screenplay they wanted a frightening look at Hollywood like no other film director has done before. Not only do William Holden and Gloria Swanson have good performances but so does Eric Von Stroheim as her first husband and Desmond's butler. This is one o those movies that really deserved best picture but didn't win. I had no problems at all with this film, but I personally don't get why Alfred Hitchcock didn't direct this movie in the first place?",Sunset Blvd.
146,caa821,Whole exceeds parts - but still to be recommended,10,4 August 2006,"Like many things, some movies can be described as a ""whole which exceeds the sum of its parts."" This film is one of those - and ""parts"" can reference both the general description as in the term, as well as those ""parts"" played by the cast members. Gloria Swanson overplays her character (nothing new for Ms. Swanson), as one would expect from the faded, silent-screen, delusional actress she portrays - and in view of the fact that overacting was more prevalent in the era during which this picture was filmed, especially those in the film noir genre. However, Gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver, but like a whole colony of them. Erich Von Stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. William Holden (outstanding in so many roles, from ""The Moon is Blue"" and ""Stalag 17"" onward), and Nancy Olson, make June and Ward Cleaver, or the Bradys, look like deep, mysterious couples. But in spite of all of this, the movie is, as a whole, interesting and fascinating, not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously, but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old. Whether this is because of - or in spite of - the performances is the question to be answered. I believe it is the latter, but whichever, it is well worth seeing.",Sunset Blvd.
147,Horror-yo,Very good but a bit on the obvious side,7,24 November 2017,"I would like to preface this review by stating I fully realize that as a person of the contemporary times my conception of pace and story development certainly conditions me to favoring a swifter more fluid progression in a film's plot. So older films will often tend to feel a bit slow. But then again ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of the top films I've ever seen despite being 5 years younger than this and about 20 minutes longer, so the point here is there's no excuse for something perceived as a flaw, not its time not anything.During some stretches the film will lack a bit of content and could've been filled with more intricacy when the narrative is clear enough to the viewer. All in all, it's obvious what the director is conveying during each section from the very start of the scene, it appears the film could've benefited from perhaps 15min less with more effective playtime. The conclusion also leaves something to be desired and contributes largely to that notion of being too self-explanatory and a scene which point is too obvious from the start. The Norma Desmond character is probably overplayed a tad (especially towards the end), which further contributes to that obviousness factor and pushes the movie towards looking like a movie rather than genuine and subtle.Of course it's still a very good film - especially if compared with the films of today it feels like a masterpiece of rare occurrence. It's strong in plot, psychologically intriguing and well crafted with several interesting developments (rather than feeding off one single idea) and the narration is just superb for about the two thirds of it before dropping to a more normal level in the last part.7.5/10.",Sunset Blvd.
148,braddugg,Oh what a tragedy that was not supposed to be there.,8,19 September 2014,"Oh what a tragedy that was not supposed to be there.It's a kind of movie that you can call cult because there were many such kind of movies later. Where, a man or woman wants to redeem their career or try hard to look younger or anything like that. To name a few, I get ""American Beauty"" and that woman in ""Requiem for a Dream"" in my mind. Where people want to go back to their younger days and just want to start again. Now, this not just the story of a woman trying to get young, it's also about a man who wants to make his career. It begins with this man, accidentally driving into this woman's mansion and just trying to act as a busy man. Now, as many other Billy Wilder movies, it starts as an accident that happens between two people, here it's between this writer and a middle aged woman. Now, that is where the film takes on, and that is the what gets us interested. This movie has a fine performance by Joe (William Holden) and other actors but it is Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) that this film belongs to and wow, she has made it her own by bringing a certain kind of wicked insanity that is rare even in today. Yes, many have tried to emulate this kind of wicked emotion as done by Swanson, but I believe she was just great at it. And hey, Gloria Swanson played out an near autobiographical role here as she had worked with Cecil DeMille in those silent pictures in true life and played that very character who just wants to get back to cameras. Wow, Billy Wilder has got the right woman as Norma Desmond.You have to watch this movie for more than one reason, it is believable, intriguing and yes it has a kind of suspense that will make us sit and see who is that man and what he is up to?. The protagonist here is not that lady though, it's the man and this is his story. The writing is simple yet great and each scene is lit well and shot well so cinematography is good in here. The audio, yes it's mostly dialogue with the big background suspenseful score filling a few gaps, music is good too. Having said all that, it's not my kind of drama and it is not my favourite yet. Though, I give it 4/5, I am not sure if I am going to sit through this movie one more time.",Sunset Blvd.

151,nickenchuggets,"""I am big. It's the pictures that got small""",10,8 September 2021,"Something that makes Sunset Boulevard a very unique movie even to this day is how it manages to intertwine real life film history into its storyline. Not many movies utilize this, but it's fantastic when used correctly. It allows the audience to relate to the film more, because some locations and characters in it are actually real. Maybe that's what makes this movie so good, but there are of course many reasons why. The movie begins with a commonly used trope that I personally have mixed feelings about, meaning they start by showing a scene that will appear much later in the movie. As of right now, you don't understand why people are trying to retrieve someone's dead body from a swimming pool, but you'll find out in 2 hours. The body belongs to a man named Joe Gillis (William Holden), a screenwriter, who, 6 months before, drove away from men looking to steal his car. He parks it in the driveway of a large mansion which appears to be abandoned. After going inside, he finds out it is not deserted. A butler named Max (Erich Von Stroheim) mistakes him for a mortician that his employer has been expecting and urges him to go upstairs. Upon doing so, Joe comes face to face with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging former silent movie star who is looking to bury her dead chimpanzee. At first glance, Norma seems rude and unapproachable. She remains convinced of her superiority to other people, despite the silent era being long gone. Norma gets Joe to read a script she has created, and despite finding it terrible, Joe uses this opportunity as a pretense to move in with her. After living with her for a while, Joe is told by Max that Norma is insecure of her fading popularity and has previously tried to kill herself. Later, Joe goes to see his friend Artie and his girlfriend Betty, who reviewed a (bad) script Joe wrote earlier in the movie. After calling Max to let him know he is about to move out, Max bluntly tells Joe Norma attempted suicide again by slicing her wrists. Joe rushes to her mansion in a panic, but Norma only defiantly tells him it was a stupid thing to fall in love with him. Once Norma's injuries heal, she is driven to Paramount Studios to give her former director and friend, Cecil B DeMille, her finalized script. She receives a predictably warm welcome from everyone considering she is a film legend. What she doesn't know is that DeMille actually doesn't like the script and he only wanted her on set to use her rare Isotta Fraschini car as a prop. Meanwhile, Norma, taking DeMille's lies about her making a big onscreen comeback to heart, starts to doll herself up. Joe eventually learns from Max that he was the one who made her who she is, and was also her first husband. Norma, still harboring bad feelings for Joe, takes it upon herself to call Betty, whom Joe has been visiting lately at her office. However, the call gets interrupted by Joe when he walks in on Norma and overhears the whole conversation. Finally, Joe comes to the conclusion that he has had enough of Norma. He prepares to leave, but before doing so, cruelly tells Norma how she is washed up with no chance of revitalizing her career. Not only that, but it turns out Max writes all the fanmail she has sent to her. Joe ignores Norma's pleas and walks out the mansion and toward the swimming pool, at which point Norma fires the pistol she bought to commit suicide with at him. At long last, the flashback is complete, and the movie jumps back to the present, with Joe's corpse laying pitifully in the water. Norma's mansion is full of cops and newspapermen, and she's completely lost her mind. Still holding on to her belief she is still beautiful, famous and rich, she walks slowly down the stairs and tells the police cameras she is ready for her close-up. To her, everything is a movie, no matter how tragic. There's no doubt in my mind that Sunset Boulevard is one of the best movies of all time, but I'm stating the obvious here. It won 3 oscars, including the one for best screenplay. Gloria Swanson was nominated for best actress, but miraculously didn't win. Even though she was nothing like Norma Desmond in real life, it is true that she was a silent film star herself. As a matter of fact, the silent film Norma plays for Joe in the movie is one that Gloria appears in. It shouldn't be surprising that the acting in this movie is all great. William Holden plays the gullible scriptwriter perfectly, although I'll always remember him for Stalag 17. He comes to his senses at the end and decides to leave Norma, but she finalizes his decision for him. Gloria Swanson as Norma is the primary antagonist I would say, and you can sense something bad will happen to Joe as soon as he met her. She's obsessed with power and even tells people Paramount would not exist without her great efforts. As shown towards the end, she would rather be a murderer than be forgotten. Von Stroheim is a minor character, but still has an important role as Norma's loyal servant Max. You can argue he is too loyal to her because he writes all of her fanmail just to shut her up. For me, Sunset Boulevard is one of few movies where the backstory is actually just as interesting as the film itself. It's worth noting Billy Wilder tried very hard to pick the right woman for Norma's role, which was definitely no easy task. Possible candidates included Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Pola Negri, Mary Pickford, Clara Bow, and even Mae West, who was enraged at the thought of herself playing a washed up old fool. As you know, the part went to Gloria, and it's hard to imagine anyone but her playing it. The bottom line is Sunset Boulevard still remains an incredible movie 70 years later, and Wilder once again shows how it's done when it comes to noirs.",Sunset Blvd.

153,bsinc,Overrated in my humble opinion,7,10 August 2003,"Dom De Luise once uttered a line I use quite often:""Nice, not thrilling, but nice!"" That's exactly how I feel about ""Sunset Blvd."", because as much as the first 30 minutes of it were extremely promising the overly long and much less entertaining middle just slowed the pace a gear to many. I somehow hoped that Joe Gillis would get himself mixed up in a murder case or something, when in fact he wound up being a victim of one in the end. Good performance all around, although not really Oscar worthy(maybe the fact that I saw ""A Man For All Seasons"" just a couple of days ago speaks for itself). I truly hope it wasn't the murder plot or shall I say the final ""twist"" that impressed so many viewers, because as much as it is unusual (and for that time perhaps almost revolutionary) I saw it coming a mile away, which is the main reason with my disappointment with ""Sunset Blvd."" Once I knew exactly what was going to happen there just wasn't any fun in watching the lonesome and forgotten old silent-movie actress tormenting herself and others anymore. I can't figure out why this movie stands so tall in the IMDb 250 greatest; a great beginning, a nice ending and some of the best narration(By William Holden) ever put onto the big screen, but the predictability of it all made ""Sunset Blvd."" overly long and not nearly as pleasing and good as it could have been. 7/10",Sunset Blvd.

An informative featurette on the composer is included.The highlight, however, is the commentary by Ed Sikov (author of ""On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder).

155,majikstl,Dead in street...,10,21 May 2004,"SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year; they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses; they both are cynical, sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And, of course, they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts, perhaps grudgingly, that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality, or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just ""a great star, a true star."" Margo's rival, Eve Harrington, may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond, but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life, SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this: ""Eve"" being the first bearer of life and ""sunset"" being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD, Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts, locked away in a haunted house, coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of film-making that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life, like her career, is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims; that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star, her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant, still beautiful, still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus, she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed, her voice is magnificent; sultry, insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad. I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad, but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed, she may have been unstable all along, but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her, and I suspect that involves Max (Erich von Stroheim). In his ""Great Movies"" essay, Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max, her ex-husband/ex-director/butler, is the heart of the story; that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max (like Joe Gillis, Norma's erstwhile boytoy) may be trapped in Norma's web, but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient, but he is the one in control, he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness. I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power; and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback. There is more than adoration that cements the relationship between Max and Norma; perhaps guilt, jealousy, desperation -- who knows? All I know is that it is best kept as a subtext, a part of the film's impenetrable mystery. The less we understand Norma, the more intriguing she is.However, if I were to be so bold as to make one major change in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it would be to replace William Holden as Joe Gillis. I respect Holden as an actor, but his screen persona has always been one of strength and -- if not integrity -- confidence; he is not one who plays vulnerable with any conviction. Plus, he doesn't play the part of Gillis with any gentle shadings. The ""romance"" between Norma and Joe is the least convincing aspect of the film. Joe treats her with barely concealed contempt and a bit of occasional pity, which makes it hard to believe that a self-absorbed diva would even tolerate him, let alone make him the house pet. The role of Joe was originally intended for Montgomery Clift, an actor with a proven ability to appear passive, even as he plays sinister. His work in THE HEIRESS and A PLACE IN THE SUN illustrate this point. I see Joe Gillis, not as a bored hanger-on, but as sycophant who is in awe of Norma, even as he exploits her, and therefore he doesn't realize that he actually is the one who is being used (sort of a younger version of Max). I think Joe should be someone who is cunning, but naive about his own limits, not someone who is already bitter, corrupt and cynical as the story begins. Maybe I am wrong, but I get the feeling that Holden was very uncomfortable playing the part of, well, a mistress, and especially one kept by such an older woman. Perhaps his manhood was threatened and that uneasiness shows. Clift, or an equally rakish young actor like, say, Farley Granger or Robert Wagner, would enliven the story and make the romance with the perpetually needy Norma more credible. I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe, I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated. The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as long-term there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable. Holden's interpretation that Joe is just doing it for the money just doesn't ring true. While a pairing of the aging diva with an ambitious -- and yes, probably gay -- younger man is practically a show business institution. Yet, even with these reservations, it is undeniable that SUNSET BOULEVARD is quite a film. A little bit Hollywood satire, a little bit moralistic fable and whole lot of Gothic melodrama. And Swanson's just-not-quite over the top performance is mesmerizing. It was assumed that BOULEVARD would revitalize Swanson's career. It didn't. But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life. Swanson played Norma Desmond, but she lived life as Margo Channing.",Sunset Blvd.

157,gsygsy,totally brilliant,10,28 June 2007,"A recurring theme in Billy Wilder's work is the price we pay for opportunism. It haunts Jack Lemmon's C.C. Baxter in The Apartment; it is life's blood to Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole; it is ironic in Stalag 17, in which William Holden's Sefton, the most opportunistic of the prisoners, ends up as the most heroic. Before all these comes Holden's Joe Gillis, whose nemesis is one of the most terrifying and glorious of all screen goddesses - Norma Desmond, incarnated by Gloria Swanson in one of the greatest ever movie performances.Swanson obviously was, to some extent, the character she portrayed: she had been one of the biggest of Hollywood names, had faded from public view, and was, in this very film, returning, as her alter-ego was attempting to do. But there the resemblance ends. With every step that Norma takes to the madhouse, Swanson moves further towards greatness. They can make the story over all they want - add songs, reshoot it frame-by-frame (someone'll undoubtedly try one day). It won't matter. Swanson will never be outrun. She knew the prototypical Norma Desmonds first hand. If things had worked out differently she might have even turned into something like one. But in the end she poured her knowledge and experience of a unique moment in artistic history into a character that could only have been created then (when sound in movies had been around for only a generation) but, through the imagination of Wilder and Brackett, became something bigger, more powerful, absorbing the weak in her wake. And that brings us back to Holden's superb turn as the spineless Gillis who, through the intercession of the splendid Nancy Olsen, finally sees the light, and dies for his insight.Writing about it, it becomes clear that this is a piece of work that transcends its time and place to join the real classics of drama. Totally brilliant.",Sunset Blvd.
158,Marynewcomb2013,11 Oscar nominations?,2,7 October 2019,"How this was nominated for 11 oscars is a mystery that needs solved!!! Holden did a good job but I noticed he was one track when it came to giving details. When he's telling Morma how it is, he does it the same way as he did in Stalog 17 when he tells the guys about security being the plant!!!
Gloria was pushing the ""acting"" to far to the point she reminds you of a 1930's horror film or even the Bride Of Frankenstein!!! It's just to much for a movie of that time!!!
Even the writing was not that great!! Joe loves Betty & when Betty finally falls for him, he pushes her away making her think he wants to stay with Norma only to pack right after she leaves. That made NO SENSE!!! I could go on and on but the point is, I waited many years to see this movie only to be completely let down!!! I love classic movies & own many classics but this movie I do not recommend!!",Sunset Blvd.
159,avik-basu1889,"It's the face, not the words !!!!!",9,27 October 2014,"This is the third Billy Wilder film I have watched after Ace in the Hole and The Apartment. After watching these 3 films, it is quite clear to me that unlike most films of that era, Billy Wilder's films used to have substantial and thought provoking messages underneath the basic plot and Wilder loved to visually voice his opinions about the different strata of contemporary society. Ace in the Hole was an uncompromising and dark study of the media and its effects on society ,while the The Apartment was a comedy with subtle commentaries on corporate/office culture. Sunset Blvd. is a film which shows the dark side of the film industry. How cutthroat this profession can be and how quickly actors and directors can become obsolete if they fail to adjust to the dynamic nature of the business. The film revolves largely around Joe Gillis,a struggling screenplay writer and Norma Desmond, an arrogant and scarily delusional former Hollywood star of the silent era. Norma finds it difficult to accept the fact that her days of stardom are behind her and the film industry and film directors no longer care for the actors from the silent era. In order to hide from the current film industry which she considers demeaning and abominable, she has completely isolated herself from the world and deliberately caged herself in her lavish and extravagant mansion where she still is a celebrity. When she meets Gillis the screenplay writer, she thinks that he can help her finish a script which she has written on her own for a film which will be her grand comeback. Gillis looks at this as an opportunity to get money out of Norma and get some respite from his financial problems. But slowly he finds himself trapped in this mansion with no freedom (which is a metaphor for the film world and how it allures and then traps people with dreams of making it big). This fatal partnership in the end leads to devastating and diabolical conclusions for everyone involved. While watching the film, I became certain that the character of Norma Desmond must have inspired and influenced Satyajit Ray to create the character of Huzur Biswambhar Roy for his film Jalsaghar(The Music Room). Like Norma, Biswambhar who was once a respected zamindar was also arrogant and separated himself from the world, a world where aristocracy was slowly fading and giving way to modernism. But while Jalsaghar was a poetic and musical masterpiece which oozes empathy and the essence of humanism, Sunset Boulevard had a dark,neo-noirish feel about it. Billy Wilder uses a lot of metaphors and symbolism. The dream about the monkey dancing for pennies, the drawing of the curtains, the rats in the pool, the limelight falling on Norma for a few moments before being taken away,etc. all these metaphors will be very meaningful to the discerning viewers. The acting is marvelous. Gloria Swanson is fantastic with her over the top and extremely dramatic representation of Norma Desmond and William Holden's realistic acting provides a good contrast to the larger than life Norma Desmond. But the only thing that didn't work for me was the melodrama in some scenes. There were a few moments which felt too unrealistic and melodramatic,especially the scenes involving Betty Schaefer. But overall this is a chilling commentary on the film industry, the miserable plight of old, forgotten actors and the glitz and glamour of the movie world which can lead to delusions. The film ends with catastrophic consequences. But the final scene has to go down as one of the greatest scenes in all of film history. That final scene is poetic, profound and yet filled with immense horror.",Sunset Blvd.
160,charchuk,Overrated but memorable,9,7 March 2007,"Slightly overrated classic that is really only great at times because of Swanson's performances - the rest of the film doesn't live up. The crazed Norma Desmond has got to be one of the most bizarre and memorable characters in all of cinema, and Swanson really made it all happen. The story leaves something to be desired, even if it is well-written, as there's not a whole lot happening, and the acting, while good, never even comes close to Swanson's performance. That may be more due to Swanson than the others, but no one else really impressed. Certainly not all Oscar-calibre performances, as all of the main four were nominated. The direction is solid but not really impressive - I only got a sense of the bizarre through Swanson's performance, not the direction - and the jabs at Hollywood, while humorous, are pretty tame. Still, a memorable flick, though not one of the best of all time.",Sunset Blvd.

162,Marc_Israel_365,Artifacts and old money...,9,23 July 2017,"A story right out of Hollywood that some thought sacrilegious, others poetic. The players are all playing themselves in many well documented ways: Willam Holden, a career dip into mediocrity (failed writer), Erich on Stroheim (discarded director serving his past) and, of course, Gloria Swanson (faded silent movie star) whose reality diminishes down the famed, framed and fated staircase spiral into the bright lights of madness.Director Billy Wilder understood what he was doing in cinematically putting this all together in every aspect the film offers and yet it is the overly dramatic ""Norma Desmond"" that haunts afterwards. Film-noir may be hard to define, but you know it when you see it. Others have taken this story concept and soul it as their own, (for me) most memorably in David Lynch's Molholland Dr. which served as my gateway to this film. Desmonds' museum to herself: of photos, movies, props (both dead, dying and somehow alive) decorate her world trapped in exile (both in career and protection of her mansion).

165,mmallon4,It's a Scene Right Down on Sunset Boulevard,10,27 March 2015,"Despite Louis B. Mayer's comments to Billy Wilder that ""You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you!"" - I feel Sunset Boulevard enhanced the Hollywood mythos. Who knows what Norma Desmonds may have existed; crazed celebrity lunatics living in their run-down ghostly mansions in the Hollywood area, not just back then but in the decades which have followed. However, the film also makes you feel sentimental for the silent era, that something really was lost when Hollywood made the transition to sound.Gloria Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is my favourite female performance of all time. Overblown, over the top, flamboyant, fantastic! A performance which could have been unintentionally comical (ala John Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe) but her insanity can be taken completely seriously; same goes for her butler Maxilillian played by Erich von Stroheim. In many ways she is that character, as Gloria Swanson has even said so herself; just looks at her reactions to watching her own pictures. Desmond is a character whose relevance for the modern world has not been lost, in an age when people are obsessed with celebrity, youth, and beauty more than ever. Likewise, Cecil B. deMille's performance feels entirely genuine, as if two old friends have just met for the first time in years.I also find the dynamic shared between William Holden and Gloria Swanson to be of fascination; an older woman seducing a much younger man who eventually gives into her when in classic Hollywood films it was often the other way around. It's clear from their actions as the film progresses the two characters are likely sleeping with each other, such as Joe happily flaunting his shirtless body in front of Norma by the poolside and she even starts drying him with a towel; there is a bit of Mrs. Robinson to her.Sunset Boulevard is possibly the most quotable film of its genre, although none its lines have become as famous in the pop culture lexicon as a film like say Casablanca, in which everyone knows its famous quotes whether or not they've seen the film or are even interested in classic cinema. Yet among circles of classic Hollywood fans, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most widely quoted films in discussions. Joe Gillis (William Holden) narrates the film despite his character being dead but it still works in an otherworldly way, like he's narrating from the afterlife. Holden holds an ideal narration voice to showcase Billy Wilder's ability to turn exposition into poetry. Likewise, Buster Keaton's appearance may be my favourite celebrity film cameo ever; there's something about his reaction when playing poker (""pass!"").For as cynical a film as Sunset Boulevard is, ultimately it is a movie for movie lovers. Particularly the scene in which Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) tells Joe Gillis of how there is no shame working behind the camera while walking through the empty back stages of Paramount Studios at night as she tells him about her childhood spending time on studio back lots, is very life-affirming. It's such a beautiful and romantic scene; it's easy why these two were paired in several films together. Olson's character is the opposite of Norma Desmond, humble and down to Earth, not concerned with her looks or fame and fortune; and unlike Norma she can actually write movie scripts.Say goodbye to Hollywood, say goodbye my baby.",Sunset Blvd.

167,zeekwunlau,Past feelings,8,24 April 2020,"This movie is an elegy for the prosperous age, commemorating the passing time, the golden moment of the Hollywood movie, the moment of the silent movie, the moment of the great actress, the moment of life with courage and wisdom. Everything in reality is crushed into pieces, so the memory stays in that gilded era.The movie focuses on the actor Joe. The viewer enters the movie through Joe's guidance and becomes the main body of the story. The movie uses Joe's narration to expand the narrative, intending to distance the viewer from the movie characters. Refusal of the viewer 's participation.Joe's opening narration, like the typical plot of the suspense film, foreshadowed the end of Joe's death and set the sky full of suspense.As the second-rate Hollywood screenwriter Joe, he accidentally broke into a desolate and strange mansion during his escape, and because of a mysterious misidentification, he never came out of the puzzle.When he ran away in the middle of the night, the heroine Norma shot at him. When he shot the first shot, he shuddered, and still stubbornly moved forward. The shot hit the second shot. He did n't make it until the third shot. Slammed into the water vertically and died in the old swimming pool.This swimming pool has appeared at least five times in the entire movie, each time with a heavy pen-at the moment when the only living creature ran through, at the moment when Joe was swimming, at the moment when Betty watched, and at the opening and ending At that moment, the moment when countless flashes focused.In the mysterious building of this old Hollywood mansion, there are endless drinks and money, but here is lonely, lonely, alienated, marginal, exclusive, here there is only one man and one woman, guarding Shaky dreams.Norma has lived in the glory of the past from beginning to end, never waking up, Max has achieved her greatness with one hand, and has dug a coffin for her. When the lights of the set hit Norma's pampering face, the cheers after another led her back to the peak. At that moment, her appearance in the movie made an annotation for Du Qing's ""Qinghui Jade Arm Cold"".When the film freezes on Norma's distorted face at the last moment, her mad and taunting eyes squint at the camera, as if proclaiming to the audience, ""I am the king of the world"". This very dramatic scene scheduling makes people use it subconsciously Hand blocking.Norma's split is a true portrayal of many of us, but we refuse to admit that we are only seeking alternative satisfaction in art and awakening that lost golden moment in fiction.There are actually a lot of things to say about this excellent noir film, but let 's stop here. Finally, I will mention the lines of the movie, which is really wonderful and amazing.",Sunset Blvd.
168,x_manicure_x,Aged wonderfully,10,14 August 2021,"""Sunset Boulevard"" has a special place in my heart as one of the first classics that interested me in cinema. It still works great after 70 years as it's a simple, straightforward, but focused film that manages to deal with timeless themes with sarcasm and intelligence without having no arthouse pretentiousness or making no life-changing statements. Video quality aside, there is nothing I would change about it.The characters are iconic thanks to the fact that they are played by actors that actually experienced the dawn of the silent era and the struggles to survive in the ever-changing Hollywood industry. Forgotten silent era diva Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson, who was herself a faded star who lost her job due to the advent of sound films. Her butler and former director Max is played by Erich von Stroheim, who happens to have directed some of Gloria Swanson's classics (one of them gets even projected in Norma's living room). Director Cecil DeMille plays himself, and other silent era actors and old Hollywood personalities like Buster Keaton also have cameos.I also loved how, in the end, none of the characters is really positive. Norma and Max are self-delusional and unable to accept that the world around them has changed, they would do anything to prevent their dream from falling apart. Joe and Betty represent the ""young"" Hollywood, but they are blinded by their ambition and egoism to the point they both chose to embark on a clandestine affair, even though they owe everything to their partners.First-person narration by the already dead protagonist Joe Gillis makes the film even more fascinating. Gillis is a talentless but arrogant screenwriter who succumbed to Hollywood's trap of fame, and it feels almost ironic that ""Sunset Boulevard"" could have been the first successful screenplay in his career.The dialogues tend to be over the top at times, but they perfectly suit Norma's character and lifestyle. Gillis' cynical tone in the narration, combined with the awareness of his tragic fate, also manages to make us understand that we are not dealing with the usual melodramatic sentimentality of Hollywood.",Sunset Blvd.
169,smakawhat,Way ahead of its time! pure madness!,9,17 June 2000,"This movie is so prophetic that it amazes me.  It showed how much Hollywood has turned into a monster by chewing up people and spitting them out like yesterdays newspaper.  It seems little has changed.Gloria Swanson as the star who has been, is flawless in her role.  At times you hate her for her arrogance, then Wilder makes you feel pity for her when you find out that all the doors in her 60+ room mansion have the locks removed so that she can't lock herself in a room and take her life.The butler also does well as he atempts to shield her from the reality of her cruel world, by writing letters that she thinks is fan mail.Wilder did such an impressive job with this film, even including actual actors in the 50's at the time (even including director Cecil B Demille as HIMSELF) to play roles.  The scene where she returns to the studio and an old stage hand shines a light on her but then only for a fleeting moment.

170,ilpohirvonen,A ruthless film about the flip side of the Hollywood glamor,9,2 September 2010,"Billy Wilder, born in Austria-Hungary built himself a huge reputation during 1940's-60's in Hollywood. He's is best known for his comedies with Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch), but his other films haven't remained in the shadows either. In 1944 he directed his film-noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, which became a big inspiration for many directors. In addition to these films Billy Wilder's trade mark is probably his own unique satire, best seen in One Two Three!, A Foreign Affair and of course in Sunset Blvd. In 1950 Billy Wilder was already at the top of his career, he produced his films himself and therefore had much more artistic freedom. This freedom allowed him to make a different kind of film with the screenwriter, Charles Brackett. Sunset Blvd. was no one night wonder, it took two years to finish it and the most time went to the writing. Brackett has told that someone suggested that they should make a film about a forgotten silent-era actress, who meets a desperate writer. They casted Gloria Swanson (who actually was one of the biggest silent-era starts) to play the role of Norma Desmond, a forgotten star.Sunset Boulevard is the second longest highway in Los Angeles, it reaches from the central station to the shore of the ocean. The boulevard entails more different modes of life than any other street in the world, the life around it is temporary; small stores, singles without families and motels. It's the street full of television and radio studios. The sunset is also the boulevard of cinema fame. This milieu of the film is very important to understand while watching Sunset Blvd.Sunset Boulevard, the film and the actual boulevard, mean traveling back in both time and place. It passes by the historical Hollywood, but the new modern Hollywood is also built around it. It's a historical journey to cinema. One could easily call Sunset Blvd. the best film ever made in Hollywood, it is a true ""Hollywood Story."" It's a modern tragedy, that follows the genre film-noir. It is very interesting from many perspectives, it's a cruel film about a cruel industry. It's a satirical description of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a desperate writer trying to get a job, the films he has written the stories for have never been that successful. One day people from the debt collection agency come to take his car. While hiding away from them Joe randomly parks his car next to an old mansion, which seems deserted. It doesn't take long for him to realize that it's actually the home of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent film actress. Norma hasn't been acting in 20 years and thinks that it is the time for her big 'comeback', so with the help of Joe she decides to write a screenplay for herself. The more Joe gets to know Norma the more he becomes aware that she is still living in the past.This is a story about two desperate people; Joe is desperately trying to get work, he has one sad relationship with a girl, which of course leads nowhere. Norma still thinks she is the biggest star in Hollywood, she still gets hundreds of fan letter each day - actually sent by her butler. The mansion is full of memories, full of her photos and there's even a film theater for her, which only shows films she acted in. Once a week Norma goes to play bridge with her friends, who all are old silent-film actors - also played by themselves; Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. Joe operatively names this group, the wax museum. When Norma falls in love with Joe, troubles start to occur. Norma seems to be a very suicidal person, she is very depressed, yearning for attention and admiration. This she can get from Joe, buy giving him everything he wants.There's something mystical with Norman's butler too he's her ex-husband and her director, played by Erich von Stroheim. What makes this film so unique is that it is designed very carefully to the smallest detail. It's full of intelligence, observations, mastery, ruthlessness, it's an agonizing film about the flip side of Hollywood. The American critics, the media, the producers and the people working in the commercial film industry saw a reflection of themselves in Sunset Blvd. The people working with cinema far away praised it for its ruthless way of dealing with actual issues below the surface. No one had actually brought these things up, so it was a very intellect idea for Wilder to do it. In addition to its main theme, the flip side of Hollywood glamor, it criticizes the way media deals with people. The disregard of human life, so many people don't care about each other, they just want to sell their stories. ""Then they got a couple of pruning hooks from the garden and fished me out... ever so gently. Funny, how gentle people get with you once you're dead.""I had seen Sunset Blvd. on television already, but now I got the chance to see it on the screen in its original format. It was a very interesting experience and I must say that this must be seen on screen, don't miss your chance if you come across with one. Sunset Boulevard is a gorgeous film about cinema and the media. It shows us the bad sides of this industry. It's also a beautiful tale of humanity and love, obsession and lust, oblivion and memory. The flip side of Hollywood glamor has now been shown to us.",Sunset Blvd.

172,Eternality,"Billy Wilder has gotten away with murder, fabricating a bold, daring picture that shoots arrows at the Dream Factory.",10,10 June 2011,"Sunset Boulevard is one of the world's most beloved films. Often in just about every critic's personal top twenty films, this Billy Wilder masterpiece sets the benchmark for a movie that depicts things many aren't privileged to witness behind the sunny facade of Hollywood. Nominated for eleven Oscars but only bagging three for art direction, music and screenplay, Sunset Boulevard deserved better in what was a competitive year for movies, with Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve winning six out of fourteen nominations.Sunset Boulevard is easily Billy Wilder's most impressive entry in his illustrious resume. It was also the motion picture that was responsible for the furore surrounding its release. The film was seen as a scathing attack towards Hollywood and its playmakers, because its depiction of America's entertainment jewel was nothing like what many were deceived into thinking in the 1950s - bright, glorious, and immortal.Accurate and methodical, Sunset Boulevard dissects what's wrong with Hollywood through a fictional but highly original flashback story of a screenwriter whom never made it into the big time. The performance of the film indisputably goes to Gloria Swanson whose character Norma Desmond is perhaps one of the most laudable and complex screen villains ever written. Swanson's distinct facial features (especially her eyes) give a sense of mysticism and disquiet appeal, while her haunting voice is almost hallucinatory, possessing anyone who interacts with her.Unlucky Joe Gillis played by William Holden may be overshadowed by Swanson but his honest display as her love interest is underrated. The other star performer is Eric von Stroheim who plays a butler with a dark and difficult past. His often expressionless scenes dictate a solemn and sympathetic aura well-suited to his character. The black-and-white film stock is a perfect representation of 1950s film noir. The distinct cinematography work complements Billy Wilder's direction, which is further enhanced by richly textured set decors.The last scene is one of the most emotionally perplexed ever - highly analytical viewers will rave about how the scene initiates a whole array of feelings in them, and is a perfect conclusion to a great film. Just like Michael Curtiz's Casablanca, Sunset Boulevard gets better with each subsequent viewing.

Gillis gets material support from Norma and a youthful vibe from Betty, but he rejects Norma's old age. If gillis had been honest about his needs, had not concealed anything, had not endured anything, he would not have conflicted with them and tortured them, but he kept it to himself and became a prisoner. Gillis's final departure was a wise one, but one that could not escape punishment -- ""all the gifts of fate have been secretly priced.""",Sunset Blvd.
175,refresh_daemon,"Melodramatic, but good, film noir",8,3 February 2007,"So I watched Sunset Blvd. It was a pretty good movie, a film noir, complete with voice over and shady dealings. But I liked how the movie induced a feeling of claustrophobia. There's a frightening sort of scary neediness exuding from Gloria Swanson's character and it traps you between sympathy and revulsion.The film exudes quality Hollywood film-making, but the high polish of the set, the capable acting, the smart-but-not-over-the-top script. It functions very well together. Furthermore, there are cameos by many studio greats from decades before, and it was fun trying seeing them aged. It was really fun seeing Buster Keaton.It had a couple moments of not-so-momentous revelations and despite its irony, appeared to flip into its own melodramaticism, although it didn't seem too out of place, considering the characters involved. In the end though, the greatest weakness was that, like many screwball comedies and film noirs of the era, it's a little hard to relate sometimes.Nevertheless, pretty solid stuff. 8/10",Sunset Blvd.

The magical performance by Gloria Swanson will be analyzed and deeply appreciated for ever. William Holden as the young novice writer also is great here. The play between the two ""stars"" is tactful and completely convincing. The movie is full of memorable lines (the writing is flawless) ...its such a great pity movie writers to-day simply CANT do it. I wonder why that is...but its true. Swanson gambles everything on her ability to go for broke....without looking fake. She does it with an amazing piece of breathtaking acting. Watching her is almost like watching a tight rope walker....without the net. This can be viewed multiple times...a real Classic. Gets an automatic 10 / 10.",Sunset Blvd.
177,squirrel_burst,"It threw me off at first, but I still really liked it, and I'd like to see it again.",9,20 November 2014,"""Sunset Blvd."" is a classy film noir that threw me for a loop at first. It features excellent performances and is paced well, building up the tension as we see the madness of the strange Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) unfold. Swanson's performance at first seems very silly and over the top, until you realize that due to her silent film career, her speech patterns have become as broad as the expressions she used to convey emotions in her films. She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow. As the story develops you will get sucked in and you won't even mind the fact that the story is told in flashback because you will either forget all about it or really want to know how the story you're seeing ends up the way it does.

178,jpintar,Outstanding,10,2 April 2003,"This is an outstanding film.  Though it was made in 1950, it is still timely today.  You simply could replace a silent film star with, say, Michael Jackson and you could make this movie today.  Norma Desmond is the ultimate tragic character in movie history.  She is so out of touch with reality that she destroys herself.  William Holden was never better.  I think this is a superior film to All About Eve even though both films haven't aged.  No character in All About Eve, though, is likable so it is difficult to keep with the film.  Sunset Boulevard, though, is full of tragic characters but they are also likable.  That is why it is superior.",Sunset Blvd.

It's about 5 0'clock in the morning. That's the homicide squad, complete with detectives and newspaper men.From that masterful opening sequence until the tragic conclusion, Sunset Boulevard maintains an example of classic film-making at its most original and revitalising level.This is one of the greatest works ever committed to film. I could stop right there and say no more. It would be justifiable...The film opens on the grounds of a run down, old mansion in Sunset Boulevard, where the dead body of a young man floats in the swimming pool. All around are news reporters and journalists, trying to capture a shot. Why? Because, the body lies in the house of an ageing film star, Norma Desmond, long forgotten after the silent era passed her by. The film revolves around the story of this bizarre, disturbed woman who was deserted by fame, her faithful butler, discoverer and ex-husband and a struggling writer who accidentally falls under her wings and she slowly, and pervasively drives him to the edge, as she becomes obsessed, fixated and jealous of any other affairs that this man has. Until, in the grand finale, she shoots him as he tries to leave her false hopes and bizarre world.This film, along with its main themes and tightly focused storyline, examines the power and corrosiveness of fame and its effects ones it leaves you. Norma Desmond is the deserted silent film queen, who spirals into madness as the world slowly forgets her day by day.Gloria Swanson, who plays Desmond is nothing short of astonishing. One of the greatest performances I have ever seen and definitely one of the best performances to be overlooked by the Academy.With outstanding performances from Eric von Stroheim and William Holden as the struggling writer, who initially finds refuge with Desmond, in this story about fame, madness and humanity. The direction by Billy Wilder is truly exceptional along with a great screenplay, a superbly suited score by Franz Waxman and creative cinematography by John F. Seitz, create an atmospheric film-noir.1950 was a good year for film. Sunset Boulevard was up against the equally recognised masterpiece All About Eve and the Best Picture was awarded to the latter, although I am convinced that Sunset Blvd. was superior. Regardless a timeless achievement and a film that is grounded in the list of the greatest films ever made.10/10",Sunset Blvd.
180,filmalamosa,Stock Hollywood precursor to Baby Jane and Psycho ad infinitum,4,28 September 2012,William Holden 32 play Joe Gilles an unsuccessful script writer who while being chased by men trying to repossess his cars has a blowout and ends up in Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson 50) driveway. Norma is an eccentric has been star from silent pictures. Gille decides to make money out of Swanson by helping her write a hopeless movie script she is obsessed with...he ends up as her lover out of pity...and is killed when he tries to leave her.I was disappointed. This movie has such an aura and I only watched it because I had just watched Witness For The Prosecution (which was excellent) and wanted to see what else Wilder had done.This thing starts out bad with Holden narrating quick cynical tough lines setting the stage for things. These lines are corny and unconvincing to modern audiences. That turned me off immediately.The movie reminded me of Oliver the 8th with Laurel and Hardy (good flick) only this was a dead serious noir/horror movie instead of a comedy. The stereotyped butler (from Transylvania type) is totally unbelievable as Norma's first husband and her first film director just one of many silly unbelievable parts of the story.Since this movie is so ballyhooed and doesn't measure up I gave it a 4 (normally something like this would get a 5 or 6 from me). That it is number 12 on the list of all time great movies just shows you what sells to the public = nothing that can with stand any intelligent analysis.DO NOT RECOMMEND,Sunset Blvd.
181,fimimix,..Masterful glimpse of early Hollywood..,10,30 August 2006,"I am 82-years-old. I have lived through the entire ""movie"" experience. I am always amused at ""reviews"" by people who weren't alive when the films were released. They can't imagine how many millions of hopeless people discovered, for a few pennies, the magical medium to help lift them from the drudgery of life. Nor are they aware that the earliest films were photographed in pure light. However, not only were the viewers entranced with pictures that ""moved"", those who were pioneering all this magic were also fascinated that their industry was growing so quickly and ingeniously. The ""silent"" period didn't last too long. Once it was discovered voices could be recorded as the actors-actresses played their roles, the technologies were developed very quickly. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a graphic display of how big stars fell by the wayside, because they didn't have good voices. HOWEVER, there is no mention in this movie if Norma Desmond had been tested for speaking roles. By Gloria Swanson's performance, I would say Norma would have remained a great star, because the addition of a ""voice"" would have become a tremendous asset. As proof, although so many people don't realize it, it certainly didn't hurt Ms. Swanson - she was much more active in theatrical presentations than most of the ""reviewers"" for IMDb knew of. Always read the ""trivia"" feature - you can learn so much. Some ""reviewers"" said she was the natural choice for the role, when actually she had to do an audition to be considered. This is shocking in itself, because Ms. Swanson was close friends with all of these studio-people who were looking for a star.""The Star"" had truly always been one - many ""reviewers"" commented that 50 years-old was being ancient. Ms Swanson was well-past that age when she made this film. What few younger people know is, she ALWAYS insisted on everything she ate was organically grown. The youthfulness of her skin was one of her characteristics which made her famous. The scene in the movie where ""an army of beauticians descended"" was the only scene you saw her naked skin - her make-up for the film purposely aged her. Having been a silent screen-star, she had the advantage of over-the-top expressions, which the script by Marcus Brackette called-for. Billy wilder knew exactly what he was getting in Ms. Swanson and cashed-in on it.By 1950, many amazing technologies had been developed for movie-making. Can you imagine how out-of-place color would be here? This script called for stark whites and grey shadows and blacks, as you saw. Not many of today's stars will be filmed in pure light. Also heavily lambasted was the ""mansion"" Desmond lived in - guess what: it's still lived-in and is gorgeous. With a little ""age-ing"", it was perfect for THIS dark story and others.As all recognize, Ms. Swanson was the ultimate Desmond. Her performance was steel, as was von Stroheim's as the director-husband-butler. They knew exactly what they were doing. William Holden (Joe Gillis) was practically unknown until this career-making role came his way, and how fortunate he was to be surrounded by so much talent. His bland treatment of the role made it plausible - not much room for emotion there. His opening scene in the pool grabs your attention from the beginning - other actors could have done that role, but not as effectively nor successfully as he did. Nancy Olson (Betty Schafer) was just right for the ambitious writer; how delightful to remember Jack Webb (Artie Green) was a normal man, rather than that robot-talking cop on ""Dragnet"". Who could have done DeMille but DeMille (he had also been an actor)? Doesn't anyone remember that Hedda Hopper was an actress before she became a columnist? ""Sunset Boulevard"" was without fault, taking its place with so many classics from that era. Norma Desmond wasn't much different than almost everyone - who wants to give-up that high-paying CEO-job, or lose an election? Although movies like ""Sunset Boulevard"" don't come too often in this day and age, some of the ""starlets"" are much more outrageous - to stay in the public eye - than Ms. Desmond was. Except for the hype, I'd take this movie over ""Citizen Kane"" any ole day. All those people ""out there in the dark"" should stay in it to watch this masterpiece. Surely rates a 50 -",Sunset Blvd.
182,Olicosmic,Film Noir at its finest,10,12 November 2019,"After watching the Christmas classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"", I was stunned by how amazing it was, and became curious how great other films from around the same era would be. It wasn't until one of my college classes played this film where I finally experienced that love of a classic film from 4-5 decades before I was even born once again, because this film surprised me. Thanks to the over abundance of films nowadays using huge budget CGI, the story telling can sometimes get cast aside for something that looks wonderful, but has no substance; a perfect example being the stunning, yet dull ""Transformer"" films after the first one. The beauty of these types of films is that it wasn't like that. Thanks to Hollywood not over relying on how a film looked at the time, the story is fantastically written and has a ton of depth. The way the characters are written are all fantastic, whether it be the charismatic ""Joe Gillis"", or the crazy and almost menacing ""Norma Desmond"", or even the mysterious nature of ""Max"", etc. They all have tons of depth that helps the story flow perfectly. This is all helped by the memorable performances from everyone. Whether it be William Holden, Gloria Swanson, Nancy Olson, Erich Von Stroheim, etc., they all gave performances that perfectly portray how the characters are. Especially Gloria Swanson, as her portrayal of the former silent film star is delightfully crazy and unpredictable. William Holden as the up and coming screen writer was phenomenal as well, but the thing that helps put that cherry on top of the awesome film sundae is his narration. It makes this film feel like a true detective case, as well as help the story flow very well, which, is also fantastic. All in all, if you haven't seen this film, I guarantee you that if you watch it with an open mind, you won't regret it one bit, as it is a masterpiece in the Film Noir genre. Sure, it's an old film from the early 50s that's much different in film making than anything today, but I would argue that this film is all the better for it, as it is a timeless classic that will be loved by many for many more decades; maybe even centuries; to come.",Sunset Blvd.
183,adventure-21903,Gloria Swanson Magnificent,10,9 November 2019,"Billy Wilder, Director of Sunset Boulevard cast Gloria Swanson of Queen of the silent movies in this return project after Mae West and other great stars turned down the role. Lucky are we that Swanson was cast. Gloria rSwanson gives one of the greatest performances ever on film as the silent screen star Norma Desmond. It is inexplicable that Swanson did not win the Academy award the only way you can rationalize it is that she had been away from films for many years and the Academy didn't know Swanson. Bette Davis gave a great performance in All About Eve as did her costar Anne Baxter (the more I see All About Eve the more I appreciate Baxter's performance) Eleanor Parker was brilliant in Caged. But Judy Holliday was magic in Born Yesterday. It was a year of great performances.I repeat Gloria Swanson should have won the Academy Award.William Holden the perfect male leading man gives a great performance in Sunset Boulevard as does Nancy Olson and a supporting cast of great players but is Swanson who grabs your attention and never lets it go.The finale of this movie is one of the great finales of all time. Billy Wilder was a genius.",Sunset Blvd.
184,frankwiener,A Mansion with a Pool,8,31 March 2018,"Gloria Swanson isn't just big here, she's huge, even when the picture may at times become a wee bit small. Her very presence intrigues me throughout the film, and I'll never understand how she lost the Oscar in that year to Judy Holiday in ""Born Yesterday"", a film that I never appreciated, no matter how hard I tried.This film has a captivating beginning and a very memorable ending, but what transpires in between often depends on Swanson's sensational presence in portraying Norma Desmond, a silent screen star whose career quickly faded with the coming of the ""talkies"". William Holden is also excellent in a role that energized his own acting career. In real life, Holden suddenly landed in Billy Wilder's mansion with much greater success than his down-and-out character, Joe Gillis. I also enjoyed Erich von Stroheim as Max, Desmond's first husband and a strong enabler of her deadly delusions.Ordinarily, I don't like Hollywood films about Hollywood as they usually lack the necessary, objective distance to portray its self-absorbed, narcissistic environment accurately and honestly, but this film is a notable exception, even if it sometimes has trouble sustaining the powerful impact of its riveting opening, including Holden's haunting voiceover as the floating corpse in the pool who has returned to life in order to tell us his sad but fascinating story.Anyway, Gillis finally gets the swimming pool of his dreams, but at what cost? Hopefully, Betty Kramer--no Schaefer--and Artie Green live happily ever after she reunites with him in Arizona. And what about Norma? Speaking for myself, I will never really be ready for her final closeup, Mr. DeMille.",Sunset Blvd.
185,paudie,Rightly seen as a classic,9,18 July 2012,"I had bought this DVD some time ago but only watched it recently. What a treat it is as the movie certainly lives up to its billing as a classic.Though made in 1950 the movie is years ahead of its time as director Billy Wilder looks at the very dark side of Hollywood. William Holden plays a down at heel Hollywood scriptwriter who accidentally becomes first the script editor and later a lot more for a reclusive silent movie star, Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Due to his dire financial straits he is unable to escape fro her clutches and, despite himself, he starts to tolerate the bizarre life he has made for himself. However a chance meeting with a young female scriptwriter reawakens his love of writing and makes him realise what he has become. However Desmond will not let him leave her life easily.The script was co-written by Wilder and is full of black humour and has some great lines. The voice-over by Holden is occasionally annoying, as it tends to say aloud what the viewer can see on screen anyway.The acting is brilliant. Holden and Swanson make a great couple, in a peculiar way. Swanson's silent movie acting style is perfect for the deluded character of Desmond. The final scene as she descends the staircase of her mansion to face the cameras is unforgettable. Holden is very good as the brash self-confident writer who has gone as low as he can go.There are appearances from great directors Erich Von Stroheim, as Desmond's faithful butler and Cecil B. De Mille, as himself. Von Stroheim is unexpectedly touching as the man who does the most to keep Desmonds fantasy alive. The extras are well worth watching, particularly the very informative making of feature.",Sunset Blvd.
186,brefane,Right up there with Citizen Kane,10,21 August 2005,"Brilliant film that is easily Wilder's best. A true classic that deserves to be ranked alongside Citizen Kane. And comparing the 2 films in terms of acting, atmosphere, dialog, conflict, symbolism, and theme (to say nothing of depth): Sunset Boulevard surpasses Kane. The ending is unforgettable and ironic:Max gets to direct, Norma makes a ""comeback"" before the cameras, and Joe has a story, his own. Like Kane, Sunset Boulevard begins with the end. The first shot is of the gutter with the film's title printed on the curb,and the first shot of Joe floating lifelessly in Norma's pool shows us he has sunk even lower: the film proceeds to show us how he got there.Sunset Boulevard is about the march of time:what time and technology does to people and what happens to those who don't or can't keep in step. And like Norma, the new Hollywood seems to be leaving Joe behind. The 2 cars in Norma's garage represent an unspoken bond between Joe and Norma; except for those cars the outside world has little use for these two. The finance company wants to repossess Joe's car and Paramount wants to use Norma's for a film.The acting is unsurpassable;the dialog and narration memorable, and the atmosphere in that decaying mansion is palpable. One of those films, like Kane, that improves with repeated viewings. Endlessly brilliant. The film hasn't aged a bit, and Swanson and VonStroheim lend it an authenticity that would be impossible for any subsequent version to equal. Essential viewing.The Paramount released DVD looks great and has worthwhile extras.",Sunset Blvd.

At first it was boring, the lines were old, the action melodramatic. I always felt that movies were the best way to express human emotions, but at the same time, the cruel and heartless wheels of movies also killed the souls of many filmmakers.Wilder was one of the directors who established the cinematic style of film noir, and this film is the most visually provocative of his film noir series.

Police and reporters arrived and as Norma is leaving her room Max prepares scene for her and she feels like a star once more. Only problem with the film is pacing at times it feels very slow but incredible story and directing keeps us interested and going. Holden's performance as Joe is very nice as he is obviously struggling to keep everything in place and to have a decent life but in all drama and changing he got himself killed. Gloria Swanson is also very good as she is obsessed with Joe and herself at first place. Stroheim as Max was fabulous as he is calm but strong character with amazing attitude.

190,brianberta,Phenomenal writing,9,29 September 2015,"From a writing standpoint, this movie is phenomenal. I can understand why this film would be called one of the greatest films ever. It has a lot going for it. However, its slow pacing can often effect my enjoyment of it.After a young screenwriter gets a flat tire, he winds up in the home of a once famous silent actor named Norma Desmond and she ensnares him to have him bring one of her scripts to the big screen and to make her famous again.Old film stars are an interesting topic. Its plot provokes sort of a haunting nightmare for everyone who wants to become a star. Its characters are memorable because of their execution. Norma Desmond is a character who slowly loses her insanity as it is slowly proved that reviving a silent film star isn't exactly the easiest thing to do. The ending shows you just how far she will go and it leaves some haunting thoughts in your head after you watch it. On the other hand though, I did feel that it was a little bit unneeded at first. I didn't feel like it was too necessary but that thought died off quickly.Joe Gillis is a character that we kind of feel sorry for. He stumbles upon her house on accident and he starts to feel that he's stuck at her house. You really can't spoil the ending since it is revealed to us how the film ends at the beginning but it makes us feel sad for what happens to Joe because he was almost able to go back to his old life. However, I can understand why the movie would choose to end like that because it makes it more clear what its message is and it explains to us more about the meaning behind the movie.The film's instrumental soundtrack is neither amazing nor bad. It just serves as a catchy soundtrack and it doesn't expand too much more than that. It isn't that impressive but I didn't notice it to be a distraction so I can't say that it diminished the movie's quality in any way.The acting is great on all parts. Gloria Swanson plays a once popular silent film star who suffers from depression and has made several suicide attempts in the past. Her acting doesn't get too amazing until the final few minutes where she is able to convey several mods at once. However, she does a thoroughly convincing role throughout the movie. William Holden's acting remains above average throughout the film. I can't say that he had a moment which truly stood out from the rest but he is still able to convey an ensnared man who is trying to keep the reality of her fame a secret pretty well. He did a good job also.For some reason, the most common complaint I seem to have about a movie is that it will have slow pacing which can bring me out of a movie to a varying degree and it can play a part in whether I'd want to watch it again. The issue I have with this movie is its talk-heavy dialogue. Some may not mind this but I grew eager for the movie to pick up its pace several times in the movie. Some movies are able to get around this issue though like ""Russian Ark"". Although it had slow pacing, it interested me because I love history and art. Also, it had superb cinematography and lighting. Some movies are successfully able to get around this problem. However, I lost much of my attention near the middle of the film because it did not provide a way to make me not mind its slow pace.Despite the slow pacing though, this movie provides a great look on Hollywood and it can be surprisingly pretty upsetting at the ending (in a good way). I can understand why many consider this to be a masterpiece and I can see why it would be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever. It is a great movie, but it could have been much better if the pacing made it an easier film to watch and enjoy. Despite this though, it's still a great movie which has a lot going for it and it is a must-see if you're trying to catch up on classic works of cinema.",Sunset Blvd.

It was from Billy wilder, so I was expecting a lot of surprises like The Double Indemnity. He didn't disappoint me at all. The film is one of the best examples of films in which much thought is given for story. The thing which kept me attached was the authoritative narration. The story revolves around a jobless screenwriter who by chance got stuck with a silent film start and she started to love him. And after this started a series of dilemma in the mind of the lead character about the decisions to be made. Entertainment is definitely assured for true cine lovers.PROS:The fascinating stories, the powerful narrative, the character representation, were too good. The director has done a wonderful job. Billy Wilder has made a special place in my heart. CONS:Pardon me for bringing this, but the acting of Norma seemed to me as too much. Sometimes it looked to be as overacted.

Other aspects outside the movie business are so-so. Sometimes the narration works well. Double Indemnity I think is Wilder's only great movie. Though Some Like It Hot comes close.

Practically every scene, shot, and edit counts. The dialogue is smart and witty. Even though it was made in 1950, the themes are still modern.The actress, Gloria Swanson, is dazzling and unbelievably good. The way she delivers her lines is captivating. She effortlessly hits notes in a way I don't think I've ever seen before.

I really loved how they took the big glimpse into the background of Hollywood and show business, with themes regarding it that are still timely and true today.

It was about a silent screen star, Gloria Swanson, who after her career ends obsessively keeps thinking she is always the star; a young reporter lives with her to get her story.  But she kills him in the end in a rage of jealousy.  What aroused my excitement was all the famous oldtimers who appeared as themselves in Gloria Swanson's career were also in this picture, ie.

The forgotten movie star living in a dilapidated, spooky mansion off Sunset Blvd. is a terrific setting. Great casting abounds with Gloria Swanson and hottie William Holden, and the strange friends each of them have. But for me, this movie falls apart every time they pull away from Gloria to concentrate on Joe and Betty's budding romance. Why devote so much screen time to a bland character, Betty Schaefer, struggling to write a who cares script called ""Dark Windows"" or whatever it's called, when we could be spending more time with faded, kooky Norma Desmond in her scary house with Max? Face it, no body writes volumes about Nancy Olson's character do they? We all know who makes this movie great, and it ain't her. The only fun scene with Betty is when Norma (surprise!) is tracking her down on the phone. I know Betty must provide a jealous factor for Norma, but her character could have been so easily pushed into the background, way into the background, and still have a suspicious Norma think that Joe is cheating on her. Same results, same ending, but less Betty!",Sunset Blvd.
197,leavymusic-2,In the top 3 of all time,10,5 October 2020,"One of the finest Films ever made, Bully wilder noted for making nr as many greats as Hitchcock, this has everything, dark humour, suspense and a lot of intrigue. Possibly I've seen it 30 or more times, it's a gem ! Hollywood when it was still great ! Don't miss this film.",Sunset Blvd.
198,robsta23,The Darker and Sadder Noir Version of Singing in the Rain,10,18 February 2015,"This is a perfect example of a great noir film, opening on a dead narrator unraveling the tale of his stay at Norma Desmond's estate after fleeing men trying to repossess his car. He didn't know the madness he was getting himself involved in, and neither did the audience.There are so many examples of great cinematic storytelling in this film, and we can even see this at the very beginning of the film. There are transitions that follow the on-screen movement to give these transitions a sense of continuity in how the story progresses. The many dissolves at the start of the film convey this same idea. Once we get to Norma Desmond's estate there is a tracking shot following Gillis along the hedges and then backing up to get a good view of the entire estate, and it is a glorious shot.Gillis' reflection on Desmond and her lifestyle create the sense of an unreliable narrator, though we can believe some of it. He says she is introverted, and we see this without difficulty by the mise-en- scene: she surrounds herself with pictures of herself, she refuses to hear criticism for her awful scripts, and she even watches her own silent films. She simply cannot move on from the days of silent cinema in which she was still relevant, and the inclusion of sound has not treated this decaying actress well; there is even an instance when she is in a studio and gets hit by a microphone, and it is clear by her face that this device is alien to her.The first time I viewed this film I was 16 and did not like the fact that Desmond gets away with murder at the end (I didn't realize she would probably be sent to a mental institution). Though I still don't like this fact, this film is a great tragedy combined with the best of film-noir, and it is a very eerie feeling at the film's conclusion since Desmond is completely out of her mind - she has lost herself in unreality. This film intrigues me with questions I still ask myself which makes me want to keep coming back to this masterpiece filled with so much content underneath its form.",Sunset Blvd.
199,Insane_Man,The Comeback,8,26 February 2021,"This movie really very strange to me as I feel unusual discomfort in some moments. That feeling can be compared with inhumanity and human desire at the same time.Norma Desmond is just not-comparable with anyone in this world. She acts like she is acting in the movie Psycho 2. Poor Joe Gillis is another actor who is also doing very very well. Max, the driver, cum housekeeper, cum... Let's leave it. You will see. And the environment. The indoor environment. What a marvelous set it was. One of the greatest sets in history.A faded screenwriter, a faded actress, their career, the house, the relationships, the consequences.One of the most unusual feeling movies I have ever experience.The scenes, the ending will haunt me a long time I am understanding.100% recommended.",Sunset Blvd.
200,kyle-cruse,"Bizarre, unique....and an excellent classic film",10,26 June 2009,"Despite its bizarre and tragic nature, I cannot rate ""Sunset Boulevard"" highly enough. What a unique film, the likes of which we simply do not see anymore. Told in flashback narration by William Holden, it tells the story of how he tried to hide from a couple of mobsters who were chasing him and accidentally stumbled across the home of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (perfectly played by Gloria Swanson). Desmond has a huge ego and believes that everyone is still in love with her films and wants her to make a comeback. As Holden is paid to write a screenplay for her, the film's tragic story begins to unfold. The story doesn't matter to this film's greatness. It's the way everything about this movie was done that makes it a timeless, excellent movie. It's some of the best dialogue you will ever hear. See the film once and you'll remember Norma Desmond forever. She is a perfect character that gives brilliant acting to every scene. For example, when Holden first recognizes her, he exclaims that she is Norma Desmond, the silent movie star who used to be big, to which she responds, in my favorite line of the film, ""I am big, it's the pictures that got small!"" I don't think there was a more brilliant way she could have said this. Swanson was completely robbed for Best Actress by Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday."" You will not see a film this good anymore. I can't recommend it enough. If it seems too strange, keep watching anyway, and watch a second time if necessary. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****",Sunset Blvd.

Great performance by Gloria Swanson whom ive never seen before.Im really enjoying discovering these classics at the moment and having enjoyed Double Indemnity this is another Billy Wilder success.

202,ozjeppe,So THIS is Sunset Blvd... - a juicier box of chocolates for movie lovers is hard to find!,9,14 November 2008,"So, THIS is the famous Sunset Blvd... and what an absolute delight it rightfully turns out to be: Captivating story of struggling screenwriter Holden who accidentally enters aging, old-time screen actress Swanson's life. Before he knows it, he is caught in her obsession of reviving her long gone-career, moving into her mansion... and more than meets the eye unfolds! A joy to watch such old - and smart - b&w (Hitchcock-stylish, indeed) Hollywood at its best, and an especially juicy box of chocolates for movie lovers and cinephiles, with all the famous real-life star faces... As much as ""Singin' in the rain"" a terrific movie about the film industry itself, a non-flinching self-inventory and the changing of the times pushing old stars out of the spotlight, with a truly great, moving portrait by Swanson.Maturely intelligent, incisive and stirringly put together with some classic scenes & dialog and an exemplary use of voice-over. It's easy to see why this triumph for writer-director legend Wilder probably is compulsory viewing for film classes! 9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Sunset Blvd.
203,Artimidor,An audacious look into Hollywood film making and its victims,10,24 December 2011,"An audacious look into Hollywood film making and its victims ""Sunset Blvd."" is a film about obsession, opportunism and the rise and fall of stars and writers as cogs in the remorseless movie making machine of the Hollywood dream factory. The great Billy Wilder as the director, William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim as the principal actors, get their point across so brilliantly in a movie about movie making that it hurts. One of the reasons why it works so well is that ""Sunset Blvd."" is fiction placed in the real Hollywood, where references are explicitly sought, not hidden: Star director Cecil B. DeMille plays himself, ""movie zombies"" of times past like Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have roles equivalent to their importance as movie stars at the time the film was shot, even former celebrated actor/director Erich von Stroheim pretty much plays himself. This lends the film authenticity and weight, sometimes a comedic or an unabashedly cynical touch, but more often revealing shockingly tragic insights in an all too common parallel universe celebrities use to live in - insights that have not lost any relevance to this day: Once caught in a dream world it's difficult to see through the haze of glory and notice that impending doom is just a step away...It was an audacious concept of Billy Wilder to target the film industry within its own medium, right there at those very sound stages where usually the blockbusters were made to rake in the big money and produce celebrities on conveyor belts. The direct assault that ""Sunset Blvd."" represents for sure did NOT get Wilder the Oscar for Best Picture of 1951. Well, this one has survived them all nevertheless and turned into a timeless classic. It's a film that transcended the Hollywood machinery - well informed, impeccably written by Charles Brackett and Wilder himself, full of verve, innuendo and dark humor, directed with technical proficiency and sense of great storytelling. An ultimate film-experience in the literal sense.",Sunset Blvd.
204,Pat-54,A Hollywood Masterpiece,10,9 September 1999,"I have always been a movie fan.  As a small child, I preferred a vintage movie over a cartoon any day.  At age 12, during a visit with my family to the famous ""Farmer's Market"" in Los Angeles, I found myself standing next to screen legend Gloria Swanson, and to her astonishment I not only knew who she was, but informed her that she was ""robbed"" when she was not given an Oscar for her performance in ""Sunset Boulevard."" That was 34 years ago, and I still believe Gloria should have taken home the golden man.  Her brilliant performance has not been dimmed by the passage of time and the film is still an unchanged masterpiece. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who wrote the script with Charles Brackett, it was a side of Hollywood that was totally unseen before.  (The Hollywood of 1950 still believed their own publicity.)  But this story, so biting in its reality left many shocked and angry.  Wilder held the mirror up, and few were pleased with the reflection.  (Legend has it that MGM boss, Louis B. Mayer, stormed out of a screening and had to be subdued before he could punch the nose of very amused Billy Wilder.) I have seen the film countless times and never tire of seeing it again, so recently when I noticed that American Movie Classics was showing it one afternoon, I tuned in.  But this time, I made a promise to myself to keep my eyes off Gloria Swanson.  Her charactor of Norma Desmond so dominates the story that even when she is off screen, she is all you can think about.  So the film began and I watched everybody but her and was amazed that I saw the film in a totally different light. At first, I was extremely sympathetic to Joe Gillis, played by William Holden.  After all, he was struggling writer who just wanted his shot at success.  Circumstances, not by his choice, threw him into the world of Norma Desmond, a world where her star had shone bright above all the others, but dimmed, as he described, ""10,000 midnights ago.""  It was here that my feelings for Joe changed for the first time.  As I said, the film is so dominated by the presence of Gloria Swanson that I had failed to see something that was very plain for all to see.  Joe Gillis, as played by Holden, was not a victim at all, he was the guy in the black hat.  He was the bad guy. The original choice of to play Joe was 29 year-old Montgomery Clift.  This casting would have validated the supposed age difference between Norma and Joe. Clift, who had been in a similar liaison in the early stages of his career with singer Libby Holman, got cold feet and backed out of the project.  Holden was the replacement for two reasons, he was under contract with Paramount and he was available.  So despite his initial reservations, William Holden accepted the role.  Gloria Swanson looked the same age as the 31 year-old Holden, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Gloria herself. Wilder had requested the make up department to age the youthful looking 49 year-old actress during pre-production test shots until a frustrated Swanson snapped back; ""Why don't you try and make him (Holden) look younger?""Holden plays Joe with a hard edge, a self-loathing for everyone including himself.  He feels compelled to take from Norma, feel pity for her, but hate her nonetheless.  His preference for Betty Schaefer (played by 21 year-old Nancy Olson) now seems a mystery.  Why this plain Jane over the glamorous Norma? The ending of the film also changed for me.  Joe really murdered Norma, not the other way around.  He knew how unbalanced  she was, yet he pushed her over the edge with glee.  When Norma takes the gun and aims it at Joe, I found myself feeling that the bastard got his ""just deserts,"" and felt satisfaction when he plunged into the pool riddled with bullets. Billy Wilder's first draft of the this story was a comedy that he wrote with Mae West in mind.  This Norma Desmond did in fact return to Paramount and would make ""Salome"" as her ""return to the people out there in the dark,"" which was so ""over the top"" the public assumed it was a comedy, becoming a huge hit, making Norma a star all over again. (This concept was used seventeen years later by Mel Brooks in ""The Producers."")  Apparently, Mae was not amused about playing a ""has-been,"" and Wilder re-wrote the treatment as a drama.  In a way, I'm sorry he changed the ending.  I would have loved to have seen Norma have the last laugh.",Sunset Blvd.
205,philthegreatone-786-63058,A masterpiece,10,8 August 2015,"This film is about an aspiring screenwriter who falls for a faded ageing former Hollywood star. The film really explores the dark side of Hollywood. How heartless and mean the town can be. The film is beautifully shot in black and white. The music is very dark and interesting. The screenplay is very well crafted as well. I have to talk about the performances. Gloria Swanson as the ageing former silent film star is basically playing a version of herself. She is amazing in this role, desperate to get back on top, and being on the big screen again. William Holden playing the aspiring screenwriter is an opportunist who thinks he can make the big time in Hollywood by bringing back this ageing star. The film is beautifully directed by the great Billy Wilder. This is truly one of the great films of Hollywood, showing the dark side of the town. A true classic. I highly recommend this film",Sunset Blvd.
206,patryk-czekaj,Amazing noir achievement,8,23 May 2012,"There is a reason why Sunset Boulevard became a sort of defining movie of the film noir genre. It involves ruthless murder, sexual connotations, deceit and failed romance. However, there is difference between this film and other noir titles, which actually made people more interested in seeing Sunset Boulevard. Mainly, Billy Wilder's depiction of a story of a forgotten movie star seemed so real and believable that everyone wanted to experience it from the side of a passer- by. For ages humans were interested in the lives of the rich and famous. And this film presents one of the saddest and toughest moments in the life of a celebrity – the sudden and unexpected fall into the nothingness after years of being on top. Additionally, Wilder gave a very strong and gloomy twist to it, making the movie a real directorial masterpiece.The movie sets a very fast pace right from the start, showing a dead man floating in the swimming pool, as the police arrives at the scene of the crime.Then starts the retrospect, presenting the viewer with a tragic tale that centers on an aged woman, Norma Desmond, who was once a huge silent movies' star in Hollywood. However, with the beginning of the sound era she simply became useless. No one wanted to cast her in the new productions. Yet, she still believes that her fans are writing to her and that she will once again rise and be on the posters all around town.Sunset Boulevard, the address of her house, is a great allegory to her position in the film world. She had her time on the pedestal, but know the Sun has inevitably set on her career and she can't do anything about it. Every day she is struggling with thoughts of a comeback (a word, which she actually hates), but it just won't happen. Only her butler (and first husband) Max is aware of thisSomewhere along the road, completely out of the blue, comes her savior, the screenwriter named Joe Gillis. He is desperate for some money to cover his loans. She is desperate for someone to edit her personally written script for a movie, in which she will also play the main role. Her insanity makes her incredibly jealous over him. She doesn't let him leave and meet other women, even though he is just using her and her money without any feelings. That the story ends in great tragedy mustn't be stressed, obviously. Going deeper and deeper into the madness leads to the final outburst, the 'beautiful' crime. Paradoxically, this is the moment when the cameras start rolling again and she is the main object of interest. And she loves it, like she didn't even know what happened a few hours before.Gloria Swanson definitely steals every scene that she's in. She is marvelous as this old star, who still thinks that she is younger, prettier and more talented than all those young Hollywood actresses. Her fantastic style, seriousness, way of speaking – it all makes for an unforgettable performance. William Holden stressed with this role that he is a marvelous actor and possibly one of the greatest in the 20th century Hollywood. Also, fine use of narration to add to the dark atmosphere of the profoundly calamitous events occurring throughout the movie. All in all, this is definitely one of the movies that are a must see in the history of American cinematography. It shows how thin is a line between fame and obscurity. We don't even know how many of the once-famous characters were suddenly deemed useless and replaced by new generations. It sounds as sad, as it is inevitable.",Sunset Blvd.
207,Elizabeth-328,"""A Hollywood Story""",10,25 July 1999,"This is really a great movie.  And it's amazing how no one wanted the parts of Norma Desmond or Joe Gillis.  Gloria Swanson accepted her part after many actresses, including Mary Pickford and Mae West turned it down.  And William Holden wasn't a big enough star to refuse a role, so he was forced to accept after people like Montgomery Clift and Fred MacMurray turned down the part. So it's funny that both Holden and Swanson received Oscar nominations for their parts.If you've never seen this movie, it's become a Hollywood classic, and you really need to see it.  Everyone remembers Norma Desmond's famous last words: ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille.""Rating: 10/10",Sunset Blvd.

209,ilovesaturdays,Should be tagged 'horror',5,15 April 2020,"This movie should be tagged horror, considering the big bulging eyes that Swanson scares the viewers with, all through the film! Her acting is so over the top that it grates on one's nerves. Come to think of it, the whole movie had a very unpleasant feel to it. I really enjoy dramas of all kinds including tragedies, but this one was plain boring! I didn't really care about any of the characters' fates.The first ten minutes or so of the movie are actually good if you can get past the fact that a corpse is the narrator, although initially it was probably someone else because he addresses the corpse in the third person. But, whatever the case may be, after the first 10 minutes, the movie just dragged on & on. The butler's reasons for staying with the has-been actress are also weird! He was empowering her delusion and thus making her more dysfunctional by the day. Would you call it love or hate? And why is everyone so accommodating at the end towards a murderess even if she is mad? Why does she get to live her fantasy? Many people lose their mental balance and they are never given such a fair treatment even if they haven't just murdered someone.Had an interesting start like a good old mystery, but overall very unpleasant.",Sunset Blvd.
210,budmassey,"The point is, they remember.",10,25 March 2001,"This film has an eerie ""Citizen Kane"" feel to it. Swanson illuminates the screen as only a silent star could. As she puts it, ""We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!"" And oh what a face. Wildly lunatic and yet undeniably beautiful playing 50 although she was well into her 60's here. Swanson is the faded butterfly who was once so great that a maharajah once came all the way from India to beg one of her silk stockings. Later he strangled himself with it.There's every cliché of dark satire imaginable here. An organ that plays itself as the wind moves through it, a mysterious servant who is more than he seems, the cynical observer drawn into the intoxicating world of a bygone age preserved pitilessly inside a wax museum of a mansion where the ballroom was re-floored to please Valentino. The only difference is that it was the endless stream of imitators that made these things cliché. Sunset Boulevard was a shocking original that caused a scandal as it exposed the house of cards starmaker machinery that cast aside the Norma Desmonds of the world for lesser stars. According to Norma, ""They took the idols and smashed them... And who've we got now? Some nobodies!""Of course Swanson's ""I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille!"" is what everyone remembers, but the point is, they remember. And they always will.",Sunset Blvd.
211,ohlabtechguy,Lacks important message!!!,6,1 March 2018,"Am 58 and just saw this on TV. Very familiar with William Holden and have heard of this movie, but just now watched it. It's sad that this former silent movie star, Norma, is clearly mentally ill and had been for sometime. But the movie is not about mental illness. Norma is portrayed more like an older, wealthy, eccentric, former movie star that just can't let go of her dream of being forever young, forever loved and forever a relevant star. Because her illness goes unrecognized and therefore untreated, she carries out a horrific act at the end and then we get to see the full extent of her illness as she enters the realm of nonreality and pretends to be back in the studio being filmed. Just really sad that in 1950, this was how they viewed mental illness - just eccentric people who didn't quite think and act like everyone else.",Sunset Blvd.
212,Benjamin_Cox,"A proper, timeless classic but much darker than the title suggests - 93%",10,15 September 2010,"Given that I've been busy holidaying at another famous boulevard (Las Vegas Boulevard, if you must know), I'm afraid that it's taken me a couple of weeks to get round to writing this. In truth, the extra weeks haven't deadened or weakened my extremely high opinion of this certified classic. I confess that black-and-whites aren't my normal area of preference but Film 4 has a habit of showing amazing and largely forgotten films during the day so when I spotted this, I took the plunge and enjoyed this dark, twisted fable on the perils of fame and the fickle nature of the Hollywood machine.Washed-up screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is struggling to survive in Hollywood, outwitting the various loan-sharks after him. During one such escape, he finds himself stranded at the tumbledown mansion of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her loyal butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). After befriending Joe and convincing him to work on a rewrite of her own script, Joe senses the opportunity to use the situation to his advantage. But as Joe falls ever deeper under Norma's influence, he begins to find himself alienated from his own friends until he starts to fall for is friend's fiancé Betty (Nancy Olson)...Being both ground-breaking in its portrayal of Hollywood's film making process as well as its subject matter, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is such an accessible film in ways that most modern films aren't. On one hand, it is a classic film noir but it's also a biting satire on movie-making in general, the first film showing audiences the action beneath the scenes. At other times, it becomes a disturbing horror film especially when the tyrannical Norma Desmond is tipped over the edge, leering at the camera like a vampire in make-up. This is largely down to Swanson's performance, being both suitably melodramatic and dominating the film as she should. Not to say that the others don't perform as well or any of the cameos which fans of early movies will delight in. Most films, when they try to be many things at once, struggle to fit their brief but such is the feeling of ""Sunset Boulevard"" that you never get the feeling that anything was missed. This is one of the most complete films I have ever seen - even my favourite films have something I could criticise if I was being picky. But there is very little not to like about this movie - like most film noirs, you need to stick with it and pay attention but the rewards are quite remarkable.It's difficult to imagine how much of an impact this would have made in 1950 but even today, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a film that everyone should watch. It's chilling and amusing in equal measures, being a powerful fable about the effects of fame and power which I felt was still relevant today. It truly is a timeless piece of movie-making, one which is actually deserving of the praise heaped upon it back then and today. It's bold, brave and utterly magnificent.",Sunset Blvd.

I completely agree. With many members of the public, real-life and screen can become blurred. Other actresses had turned down the role of Norma Desmond, and Ms Swanson, who was not in any way like the role she played in this film, showed real guts in accepting the role.The arrival of talkies came really quickly. I have read through some of the film magazines at the time. I read letters from the fans displaying undying love for Clara Bow, Norma Talmadge, Jack Gilbert etc. Within the space of a year the fans had dumped them in favour of the new talkie stars. This film is a possible scenario of what might have happened to one of these stars.Like Miss Havisham in Dickens's Great Expectations Norma Desmond still lives in a time warp. She is still a star, and she is planning her big comeback. Her manservant, ex-director and ex husband humours her. But one day reality comes in the shape of her toyboy played by William Holden. She cannot face reality, so she kills it.This is possibly the first time that Hollywood got to grips with the stories of what has happened to people who were spat out by the film industry.",Sunset Blvd.

Wonderful film has Gloria Swanson basically playing herself (minus the insanity of course) as a former darling of the silent screen, Norma Desmond, who couldn't make the transition to talking pictures.  She is joined by her butler and Joe, an out of luck writer, who becomes her pet in a sense.  Norma's major problem is that she cannot accept that her time has passed and she is convinced that she can make a comeback. Joe realizes that Norma is a has been, and sets out to find new things but as the movie progresses we see just how vindictive and clinging she can be. I will not spoil the climax but it leads to one of the most unforgettable scenes in Hollywood history as Norma slowly descends the stairs, preparing for her ""close up"" with a possessed look on her face.

219,Lucabrasisleeps,Somewhat Dated Hollywood movie,7,11 February 2009,"That's how I felt about the movie overall. Certain aspects of the film seemed dated. But there are many aspects that are quite relevant too.It has an interesting premise. A struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis(William Holden) starts living with an old star of the silent era Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) in order to write a screenplay for a movie she wants to act in(which is supposed to be her big comeback). Joe is amused by Norma's behaviour. She still lives in an illusory world in her mansion where she is still a big star. Her faithful servant Max Von Mayerling also feeds her ego and keeps telling her that she is a big star. Norma begins falling in love with Joe and gives him presents in order to keep him. The movie then follows Norma's degeneration and the final over the top conclusion. The situation of old actresses who were stars in the past is very well portrayed in this movie. The dry humour and sarcasm in this movie is also an aspect that raises it above the other classics of the Old Hollywood era. It can also be seen as a satire of the Hollywood system. The scene where the director tells his assistants not to call her again - the same director who had once promoted her heavily - is a sad scene which shows the fleeting nature of showbiz. The portrayal of Norma's obsession with Joe is also excellent. The way Joe gillis uses the opportunity to his own advantage is also quite funny in a sad depressing way.The attitudes of the people reveal a somewhat dated attitude that doesn't quite fit in today. The scene in the shop where the shopkeeper says ""Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicuña?"" shows a somewhat derisive attitude towards a woman having a ""trophy man""(while the opposite has been accepted). The attitude of Joe Gillis also seems dated. He behaves as if he is embarrassed that an older woman is interested in him. The line ""I had to be with people my own age."" shows the derisive attitude he has towards Norma's love towards him. I felt that the movie was a bit behind the times in these aspects. The ending was also a bit too over the top for my liking.The performances are top notch. The laidback acting style of William Holden is complemented by the over the top performance of Gloria Swanson. The over the top performance was appropriate in this movie, I guess. In many scenes she even seemed cute when she proclaims that she is one of the biggest stars. There is a likability to her character even though she seems a bit unhinged throughout. Nancy Olson is gorgeous and she is adequate for the role. Erich Von stroheim is very good as the faithful servant Max and it is surprising to note that he wasn't a professional actor while doing this film. Cecil de mille's cameo is actually quite good.I liked the movie but felt that the movie seemed a bit too dated for my taste. It can be taken as a stinging critique of Hollywood that is relevant even now. The dated aspects prevent it from becoming a great movie though.7/10",Sunset Blvd.

Creepy: Diary of a mad(wo)man",10,14 November 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 32I'm going to get this out of the way: it's hard for me to formulate coherent thoughts about Sunset Blvd. If you haven't yet seen the score, I loved it. LOVED it, like one of the few 10's I award love it. But it's a difficult film to describe, you simply have to experience this one-of- a-kind masterpiece.Sunset Blvd. follows hack (love that description) writer Joe Gilles, in the gutter, as he finds himself in the lap of eccentric silent star Norma Desmond, who is planning a comeback (""It's a RETURN! I hate that word"") and wants Joe's aid. In a sentence, the film shows that relationship. But it's so much more than that. You see right from the start, beginning with very cool credits, it's also a murder mystery to constantly think about. It's also famously a look at Hollywood, post- sound transition. Where to start? The acting. Our narrator and protagonist(?) Joe is the cool, straight man in this odd tale, but like everything, he isn't a perfect person. His performance is however. We're never sure what side of the game he's playing, but he sure looks like he does.Joe may be the protagonist but Norma Desmond is the star. Up until today, if someone asked me to name an amazing female performance, I couldn't. But Gloria Swanson, in a role much like her life (minus the crazy) fully realized this intriguing character. She's a woman who can't let go of the past, someone unable to look forwards. we all know someone like that. And her ""development""- she's a silent star alright.The whole thing has a creepiness to it, and I can draw several connections between this and 'Psycho'. Creepy isn't quite the word, 'queer' is a little more fitting. But it's unsettling, and a large chunk of that is Max, Norma's butler. His constant presence is freaky, his loyalty scary. Erich von Stroheim, a silent director, is perfectly cast in this role, even if he didn't like it much himself.It's remarkable how this echoed real life. Gloria Swanson plays a character who mirrors her own life, and is accompanied by one of her former directors. Cecil B DeMille, famed director, plays himself. Numerous other cameos happen as well, include one of my favourite scenes, where Norma plays bridge with other silent stars, namely Buster Keaton, who actually speaks. It's as though this really could've happened, these people really lived among the stars of the day. A film about writers has to have good writing, and Sunset Blvd. delivers in script, cinematography, and all technical aspects of film. The mansion is extravagant, a worthy choice for the Set Design Oscar. Also the music, while not iconic or even having a main theme, wonderfully plays along with the film,adding the extra level to a magnificent film.The plot wraps up eventually, and if you didn't know it was coming from the start then it would be a very strange finale indeed. All I'll say is it puts the narration in a different perspective, and the film scene (and line) are strange, creepy, and just excellent.There you have it, my glowing response to Sunset Blvd.There's only one thing: I can't identify a genre. A drama is too broad, a noir would be a little off, and it doesn't quite fit the bill to be a thriller. But maybe that's the spark that makes the film so great- there's nothing quite like it, and while it's timeless, there probably never will be anything like it again. 9.6/10",Sunset Blvd.
221,schroederagustavo,Sunset Blvd. Review,10,7 August 2020,"It's funny how a film that's so much about the writing process in Hollywood has maybe on of the greatest scripts ever. I watched this movie for the first time ever today, 70 years after it was released, and it's still an incredibly gripping and entertaining movie, with complex characters, constantly making morally ambiguous decisions. The film is about a struggling writer who happens upon a manipulative, egocentric, middle-aged silent era movie star, who can't let go of the golden age of the past. I've heard some people call this a criticism of Hollywood, but I don't think that's right, at least not to the extent of saying that the film is primarily about that. I think it's about not being able to let go of the past, as Joe says to Norma at the end of the film ""There's nothing wrong with being 50, as long as you're not trying to be 25."" I probably paraphrased a little, but that's the idea. It has some pretty solid acting, as well. But really, to me, what stands out is the script, the characters and the dialogue. It's a great movie.",Sunset Blvd.
222,FilmMuscle,A Cynical and Unfortunately Honest Look at the Industry,10,21 October 2013,"Since I'm one of the biggest ""movie buffs"" and have written several screenplays already, I always enjoy the films that focus on the industry itself, covering the events that transpire behind the scenes. Surprisingly, I went into Sunset Blvd. blindly. I wasn't quite sure what the true premise of the film was nor was I aware of its genre. The film and title, of course, is especially famous- another timeless classic. So, as the picture commences with a character who's dying to make it ""big"" in Hollywood, I was already hooked right from the start. Suddenly, he's being chased by repossession men and desperately attempting to escape the eerie atmosphere of Norma Desmond's gigantic home. May I say just how substantially creepy I found Norma Desmond and the depressing, desolate environment she surrounded Joe with? From the hair-raising music to the sinister look on Norma's face all the way to the overall mystery of Joe's situation forced me to strongly grip the handles of my office chair, hoping Joe returns to the city, that's filled with excited and friendly faces, as soon as possible. Then again, with the setting comes the movie's presentation of this interesting juxtaposition between Norma's more optimistic perspective on her Hollywood career versus Joe's more sardonic and restrained outlook on the industry's patterns. So, knowing full well that Joe will eventually meet his demise near the pool- that foreshadowing scene near the beginning obviously locks in Joe's fate once the conclusion hits- created a much darker tone within the place he was staying but not exactly knowing how it'll occur whether it'll be done by the hands of Max (for an unknown reason), Norma Desmond, or the return of the repossession men. On the note of Joe's unfortunate death, I applaud Billy Wilder and his efforts to convince the studio in killing off the protagonist of the story. It was certainly rare during its time, and I'm sure Wilder went through great lengths in order to see it done as can be seen by the sheer dictator- like control these studios and producers have over the productions in Hollywood, ultimately limiting artistic freedom. It's also difficult to imagine how the film was able to paint such a cynical view of the movie industry, clearly portraying Paramount Studios in the process, without wide objection and protest. Essentially, in my opinion, that is exactly what makes a classic and its sustaining memory in moviegoers' minds for decades to come: a daring work of its time where we look back and wonder how the project was successfully finished whether it's concerning its technological/technical aspect, its subject matter, or the structure of its story. In that regard, Sunset Blvd. definitely amazed me, and in knowing I wasn't viewing a generic Hollywood movie that played along all the tropes and included all of the studio mandates, that edge of unpredictability was immediately inserted into my intense viewing. I have to question, though, the necessity of the sub-plot with Joe and Betty's romantically-developing relationship. Let's not also forget about that corny kiss (with the stereotypical love music in the background) before Joe made his permanent return to the mansion. That entire arc felt more like a studio mandate than anything for me, but otherwise, the story's whole progression and execution was unquestionably memorable and remarkable. In addition, the unexpected shift in Joe's personality and attitude towards the end felt slightly unnatural and odd. In a matter of minutes, he changed from a worried and charming fellow to a reserved and aggressive one. Anyways, it had its fair amount of twists and turns and entertained all the way until its finish. There could be much discussion about the film's treatment and view of the celebrity status and the terribly unfair standards that Hollywood persistently follows, but as Joe mentioned in an earlier scene, a motion picture doesn't always have to overwhelmingly and blatantly boast its themes. Sunset Blvd. will undoubtedly stick in my mind for years to come due to its absolutely frightening ambiance and fascinating storyline.",Sunset Blvd.
223,Arkaan,Warning: Extreme Cynicism,10,23 May 1999,"Be forewarned, the cynicism in this movie is extreme.  But if you don't watch it, you will miss the best film about Hollywood ever, and one of the best films of all time ( #12 on the AFI list). Gloria Swanson gave undoubtedly the best performance of 1950, and should have won Best Actress.  William Holden, Erich von Stroheim, and Nancy Olsen also gave stunning performances and deserved their Oscar nominations. Darker than most films, but better than most films, this is a true classic, that hasn't dated one bit.  It also has one of my favorite lines in film.   Not Gloria Swanson's, but Holden's final narration.",Sunset Blvd.
224,RobertF87,Fascinating Tinseltown Expose,10,7 October 2003,"This film tells the story of an unsuccessful screen-writer, Joe Gillies (played by William Holden), who stumbles into a decaying Hollywood mansion owned by ageing actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives there with her butler (the celebrated director Erich Von Stroheim).  Desmond was a huge star in the silent age, but is now forgotten.  She has been working on a screenplay which she hopes will make her a massive star again, and she wants the screen-writer to help her.  This film is a quite fascinating take on the fleeting nature of Hollywood stardom, and the heartbreak that goes on behind the scenes of the movie industry's ""dream factory"".  The film works also as a fascinating mystery, with one of the most famous openings in movie history.  Watch also for cameo appearances by such luminaries as Cecil B DeMille, Buster Keaton and Hedda Hopper.",Sunset Blvd.

Without a doubt - This picture is, indeed, an oddity in itself, being a story-of-the-grotesque that is told by, none other than, a corpse.Yes. Perhaps the most revealing movie that Hollywood ever made about its own decline - ""Sunset Boulevard"" was, very much, all about the movie industry's rise to great power, its fabricated imagery, as well as its total worship of youth and its own dark past.And, of course - Irony of ironies - Only director Billy Wilder could imagine Tinseltown as a place where the dead go on speaking - Talking about their lives as if nothing had changed.",Sunset Blvd.

I have always enjoyed film noir, but never really respected it as much as I would have for other movie genres, but Sunset Blvd. changed my mind. I could not find a single thing wrong with this movie. The acting, writing, and plot were all wonderful. The writing, of course, was the snazzy film noir type dialog that can be easily noticeable. The movie included famous lines such as: ""I'm still big, it's the picture that got smaller"" and ""Mr. Demille, I'm ready for my close-up"" The movie was still scary, even now, 55 years later! Overall, this is one of the greatest movies of all time and the best movie of the 50s.I highly recommend this movie.",Sunset Blvd.
228,Don-102,The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!,10,22 April 1999,"Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10,000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (""That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps."" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying ""give and take"" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even ""wax figures"" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ""ruining the industry"". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have ""changed"". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that ""Valentino once danced on."" There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10",Sunset Blvd.

230,blackburnj-1,"A chilling, brilliant and iconic piece of cinema",10,8 July 2009,"Billy Wilder's haunting and masterful tale of possession and fallen glory remains one of the most iconic, entertaining and disturbing films ever produced. It's focus on the great lost generation of silent films stars and its unforgiving look at the cut throat and fickle world of Hollywood is chilling and, at its heart, are two magnificent performances from William Holden and, especially, Gloria Swanson as the reclusive, fallen star, Norma Desmond. It is a work of utter genius reflected by its oft quoted lines (""All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close up."") and memorable visuals (the body floating in the swimming pool).The story of the chance meeting of down on his luck writer, Joe Gillis, with the former silent movie star, Norma Desmond, is brilliantly written (the film was a deserving recipient of the Oscar for screenplay). Gillis is an unscrupulous and seemingly hopeless dreamer, out of money and out of time. Desmond is similarly hopeless, but tragically so. She is not the architect of her own despair, but has been abandoned by everyone and yet is determined that she is still desired and loved by the ""millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen"". She sits in a Kubla Khan as detailed and as haunting as Citizen Kane's, protected by her mysterious butler (an effective Erich von Stroheim, who later dismissed his part in the film as ""that butler role"").The treatment of Desmond is distressing, and Gillis joins the fun, leading her on and taking her money, before he suddenly realises that he is trapped. Gillis is not as inhuman as he perhaps needs to be to follow the road he has started on and he is, thus, doomed. He cannot leave Desmond, who will undoubtedly kill herself in despair and is unable to write the script that may make him or be with the women he loves. The villain is Hollywood and its cut-throat and unforgiving nature which is brutal on its people and impossible for a man with the smallest slice of conscience.This was a brave film for Wilder to make, not so much biting the hand that fed him but cooking it in butter and serving it to the dogs. However, he got away with it and no wonder why. Even the hardest man had to step back and acknowledge the brilliance of craft, the harshness of wit and power of storytelling in this film. It is brutal, dark and excellent in every way.",Sunset Blvd.
231,williwaw,Gloria Swanson Brilliant in Wilder Classic,10,27 July 2011,"Billy Wilder who has my vote as the Greatest Director of all Time with a body of work that is stunning: Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Sabrina, and his comedic masterpiece Some Like It Hot, made his greatest film Sunset Blvd and today when I see it over and over I discover new tidbits of Information. Brilliant. William Holden who would win an Oscar a few years later in Wilder's Stalag and would star in Wilder's great late career masterpiece Fedora is superb as Joe Gillis. The key role in this movie is played to a fare thee well by Gloria Swanson who is magnificent, and gives in my opinion the finest performance by a female star ever; Gloria Swanson became Norma Desmond. As we know Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar to Judy Holiday for her wonderful Born Yesterday, seen today Swanson should have won. From the brilliant opening to the incomparablefending, this movie works on all levels. Masterpiece.Billy Wilder pushed the envelope his films, very daring, for example Some Like It Hot touched upon many themes one of course was Jack Lemmon's character wherein in the end it appears Lemmon and Joe E Brown will end up together.Wilder cast his films brilliantly with stars such as Stanwyck, Holden, Swanson, Monroe reaching new heights under his guidance. Billy Wilder had a bit of a stock company using Holden, Lemmon, and McMurray,over and over. One film that deserves reappraisal is the Kiss Me Stupid with a fine performance by Kim Novak. Other stars that worked for Wilder included a Who's Who of Hollywood: Marlene Dietrich,James Cagney Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Walter Matthau, Paula Prentiss, Henry Fonda, Shirley MacLaine et al.Bravo Billy Wilder",Sunset Blvd.
232,evilnigga,Brilliant,9,1 October 2021,"From the opening monologue this movie promised something interesting, and it delivers but it almost turns into an endless wacky drag, luckily the love story saves it from happening. Flawlessly acted by Gloria Swanson, she really nailed the grand delusion. I had the general idea of where the movie was going but I was still really excited to see what will happens next, perfectly constructed story and what a way to end a great drama with a great big metaphor of the killing of Joe Gillis. Joe walking down silently was a metaphor to the once great silent movie and the loud bang from Desmond's gun is the current state of cinema where dialogue rules.",Sunset Blvd.
233,DavidAllenUSA,Sunset Boulevard (1950 Paramount) is incredible for it's honesty and candor,10,1 December 2010,"Sunset Boulevard (1950 Paramount) starring William Holden and Gloria Swanson is wonderful. Screen it often.It's about art, and about the trouble with art, and people part of art.Big egos, big ideas, no results, sad politics and back-stabbing on and on and on. William Holden, the then (1950) star of the movie is shown playing the role of a Hollywood ""player"" (a writer) who ends up with a lonely, humiliating death. He went on to win a Best Actor Academy Award for Stalag 17 (1953) and was future USA President Ronald Reagan's best man at Reagan's 1952 shot-gun, justice of the peace wedding to his pregnant bride, Nancy Davis (Reagan's daughter, Patty Davis, who went on to pose nude for Playboy Magazine, was born 7 months after the wedding...the bride, Nancy Davis, was later first lady of the USA Nancy Reagan...""good girls go to heaven...bad girls go everywhere!"").Holden went on to die alone in a humiliating way in the early 1980's (found dead for days alone in his apt.), and Reagan went on to be USA President....occupied the White house when Holden was found dead.Holden became what he portrayed. This happens a lot in the movies. A word to the wise for movie stars and other actors...be careful what roles you play....you may end up playing these roles in real life.Gloria Swanson plays an old lady in this movie, and still hadn't reached age 50. Compare her with Cher, roughly the same age in Moonstruck (1987) who won a Best Actress Academy Award which included romantic nude sex bedroom scenes with much younger Nicholas Cage (roughly the same age as William Holden when Holden acted in Sunset Blvd. [1950]).Cher stayed gorgeous in her 40's, became the mother of a famous homosexual daughter turned ""male"" first named ""Chastity,"" then re-named ""Chaz,"" not a bit as pretty as Mom...bad weight problem, among other problems. That's Hollywood! Swanson and Cecil B. DeMille both acted in Sunset Blvd. (1950) and both were very good. Two of the biggest major players in silent era world cinema history....this movie is worth seeing just to look at them, see them talk, see why they were so good at what they did.The final scene shows the hero getting shot in the back....by the other hero in the movie.No epic is big enough for two heroes.

234,Tommy-92,Gloria Swanson... Wow!,8,15 October 1999,"When I was watching this movie, I hardly ever took my eyes off of Gloria Swanson whenever she was on-screen.  Whenever she arches her eyebrows and her eyes get big and she starts to go crazy, her performance is so magnetic. She truly becomes her character.  It probably wasn't hard for her to do; she, after all, was a glamorous silent film star herself who had all but disappeared from the scene for years before this movie was made.  But her sharp delivery of the dialogue makes you believe every word she says.  That isn't to say that the rest of the film isn't good.  William Holden is very good, especially in those biting, darkly funny voice-overs.  Erich Von Stroheim is very eerie as the devoted butler Max.  (He was a silent-film director in real-life who made six-hour epics in the 20's, one of whcih actually starred Swanson.  He did not, however, discover her and never married her.)  The direction focuses heavily on the dark, fobodding, almost misty atmosphere of the whole thing, and the movie's all the better for it. But the best thing undoubtedly is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance as the greatest star of them all, Norma Desmond.""I am a STAR!""""I am big; it's the PICTURES that got small!""""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my CLOSEUP!""",Sunset Blvd.
235,kyle_c,More than just about Hollywood,8,31 May 2002,"""Sunset Boulevard"" is considered to be one of the quintessential Hollywood films.  It takes a bitingly satirical look at what makes Hollywood work. However, beneath its surface it is more than just that. It's a uniquely strange look what happens to a prima donna who's fallen from her high horse.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a young, down on his luck Hollywood writer. He's just scraping by, trying to hide his car from repo men.  He winds up in the house of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging silent film star who is working on her comeback screenplay.  She gives Joe the job of fixing the screenplay, although her aim is basically to have him for company.The characters are well formed and incredibly well acted, specifically in Joe and Norma.  They are three dimensional - each has their own internal struggles and desires.  Joe, on one hand, relies on Norma to keep up his good life that it has, but on the other hand wants to go out and be with the girl that he loves.  Norma is stuck in the delusion, kept up by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), that she is still famous.Holden and Swanson perform their parts brilliantly.  Holden is the man trapped, with no way out.  Swanson overacts, intentionally, saying every line with such grandiosity that she perfectly captures the way Norma feels about herself and her perceived stardom.This movie is about a woman who was once great and has fallen.  She reacts to it not with acceptance, but an unconscious denial.  She, along with Max, has convinced herself that she is still a star with legions of fans.  Joe keeps up the charade because of everything that he is offering her.  The idea of the middle aged woman keeping the young man for company is genuinely strange, but it fits the picture that Norma is trapped in the past, and fails to move on, but rather deny it.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a brilliant movie.  It works on two levels - as a satire about the hollowness of fame and Hollywood, and also as a look at what happens when one has fallen from grace.  Its status as one of the greatest movies of the era is certainly well earned, and it has certainly survived the test of time.**** out of ****",Sunset Blvd.

237,joshuafagan-64214,The Best Movie About Hollywood Ever Made,10,12 October 2015,"First off, read that name a few times. Then a few more. 'Sunset Boulevard.' Does that not just send shivers up your spine? Yes, I am well aware that it is the title of the famous street in Los Angeles in which the film takes place. But it seems more... invocative than just that. If such is pure coincidence, then it is a coincidence that makes a great film even better. But i don't think it was. Knowing the quality of this film, I think that it was meant to invoke deeper feelings in the viewer than just 'oh, that's the name of a street in Los Angeles.' When the film begins, we are greeted with a flash-forward to the end of the movie. I always love it when films or books do this. Surprise is sometimes good, but it is often overrated. Once enough time is out, everyone knows your secret. So there is certainly something to be said for just revealing what happens at the end of the film and launching into an elucidation of how such came to be.We are also greeted with an opening narration. From that moment onwards, this film had me. Not because I am just a sucker for opening narrations (though I am). But because it is just so good. And I say that as a novelist. Truly, it is one of the best openings narrations I've seen or heard, in literature or film or any other medium. With one fell swoop, it sets the tone of film, establishes intrigue and tension, and messages your brain and heart.The style of this film is excellent. Every decision is conscious and It also establishes the fact that this film takes heavily from film noirs. I don't think I would quite consider it a noir on its own night. But it certainly was made by someone who not only loves film noir, but knows how to make use of it, and what it adds to a film. As a lover of noir myself, I will always support that.purposeful, advancing the fabric of the tightly woven story. But style isn't everything. Which makes it a good thing that this film succeeds on grounds of substance as well. It should tell you something that the first work that came to mind as I watched this was The Great Gatsby. It's not a perfect comparison, of course, but it does manage to invoke some of the same complex feelings.There are so many themes at play here that I could be up here until midnight three days from now and still not have covered everything. But you don't need to fully unravel them; for mood and story's sake, it is enough to know that they are there, that they are present and will keep being so. It's like you're a kid watching a complex work for the first time; you may not know every intricacy that is on display, but you nonetheless are comforted by their presences.At its core, this film is about a young, out of work, broke scriptwriter who is just ready to give up on the Hollywood Dream and head back to Ohio when he is confronted with a grand mansion that is owned by an Old Hollywood fading star who invites him in. She sends him to work on her overblown, worthlessly-written screenplay that she thinks will make her a star once more. For this and above all else, for comfort, she persuades him to stay with her. Having no other place to go, the young writer agrees. For a while, he lives the high life. he even gets an expensive suit. But when he wants to leave, she gets clingy and... things get interesting.It gives off the feeling that he is being pulled deeper and deeper into a spider's web. But, in a bit of a twist, the spider does not want to kill him. Yes, she is delusional and insane and dangerous to herself and others. But she has no vile or inherently malicious bones in her body. She is just, at her heart, a lonely and insecure person who is caught up in yearning for past glories, who makes herself feel far older than she really is. The young man has a great quote about this that is both fitting in context and translatable out of it. It goes like this: There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25. Simple. Concise. And flush with enough resonance to fill up a twenty-mile long crater.If you could take away only thing from this film, let it be that realism is not always needed to make a movie pierce on a real and scathing level. This film is heightened and almost reminiscent of a nightmare. But it is the best Hollywood does Hollywood movie ever and the most definitive.See you on Sunset Boulevard.",Sunset Blvd.
238,Harry_Gleeson,Billy Wilder's Masterpiece!,9,12 June 2020,"Sunset BoulevardWell this is the first review I have ever written and all I can say is, what a film to start with. I've chosen not to include spoilers in my reviews whether the film is old or is the most recent release, simply because I want others to find out what happens and make up their own minds. That is one of the many beauties of Cinema, it is subjective!First of all, 'Sunset Boulevard' is a masterful film. It certainly is one of the best films depicting Hollywood that has ever been made. Director Billy Wilder makes us, the audience, submit to what I would call the Hollywood Nightmare. How one can be at the highest of highs with their fame and career but once the industry is done with them, they are cascaded aside and left to live in the past. Norma Desmond, played magnificently by Gloria Swanson, is the example of this. From the first time we see Norma introduced in the film, we can start to unravel that this is a woman who is clearly a faded film star but is obsessed with making that return to fame. Mentally she is consumed by her popularity and constantly reminds Joe Gillis (William Holden) that all the fans send her letters, accelerating her need for the comeback. This is such a big positive of the film, the performances of Gloria Swanson and William Holden as Norma and Joe respectively blow my mind. It baffles me how Gloria did not win the Academy Award that year (1951) for Best Actress, instead losing out to Judy Holliday for 'Born Yesterday'. As I say, William Holden plays the bankrupt screenwriter Joe Gillis brilliantly and his relationship onscreen with Gloria shines through, as they go on the thrill ride of working together but also struggle to connect on any level, simply because of Norma's mental state. Furthermore, Erich Von Stroheim portrays Norma's Butler Max excellently and his presence on screen suggests something is hidden in the narrative. What I mean by that is, Max is very hidden and does as he's told, only later in the film do we find out why. Not only that, the ending of this film is one of the best I've seen in film. Once you understand the meaning of it and how it summarises the film, I'm sure you will come to the same conclusion.In terms of the negatives of the film, I would say, there are really none I can find. I don't like being picky and find silly reasons to be negative about a film, certainly a film as good as this one.This is, in my opinion, Billy Wilders masterpiece. I have seen 'Double indemnity' also and regard that very highly as it was a film I studied while at school, however after seeing 'Sunset Boulevard' a couple days ago, it left a very positive mark on me. I will never forget the performances in this film as I have mentioned several times, they were just that good. I'm sure this film set the benchmark for many future directors on how to depict Hollywood and the ups and downs a career in the industry can bring. A Masterpiece. Simple as thatQuote of the Film - 'I am Big, it's the pictures that got small' - Norma DesmondRating - 9.5/10",Sunset Blvd.
239,R_O_U_S,Scary,9,3 February 2004,"This opens with a corpse.  And so to every recent movie told in flashback and leading inexorably to tragedy.  But this did it first and better.  And in Norma Desmond it created one of the most chillingly insane women ever to grace the screen.  And I'm a sucker for a psycho bitch from Hell.  But this does it in a very classy way.

241,Incalculacable,Absolute Perfection,10,4 March 2006,"Sunset Blvd. is a terrifyingly realistic portrayal of a washed up movie silent screen star and her quest to rekindle her popularity... and a poor writer on the run from the police who gets involved with her. The story starts backwards: you see a man floating face down in the water, and so the story begins... how it all started.Norma Desmond is a character that you hate, love and feel sorry for all at the same time... she is very selfish, self absorbed and needy. But I felt a strong pang of sympathy when Norma talks about her script for Salome... how she has such high hopes about her comeback. She just wants to be loved again. I could not imagine anyone else playing Norma Desmond.. Gloria Swanson plays it to perfection. William Holden is great also - and I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it to me, but playing such a casual, nonchalant character such as he did against such a strong character of Norma is quite challenging. He did it wonderfully and delivered the lines with ease.After watching it the first time, I watched the bits I wasn't sure of - I was sure if I liked the lines the way they were delivered - and it grew on me. For example, I always imagined the magnificent last line delivered more slowly than Swanson did it... but as I watched it again, I began to like it more and more. Now that I have watched it twice, I cannot really find anything wrong with this movie. It has it all: drama, romance, two fantastic actors, comedy, emotions of sympathy, hate, greed, lust... I would say this one of the top 5 movies of all time, if not the top.After I saw this for the first time, there was a wonderful feeling as if I had just seen a special bit of movie history... and I was a part of that history. I don't know how to explain it, but it was a great feeling that cannot be described. This can appeal to all ages, from 12 and upward's I'd say! A true Hollywood masterpiece - they don't make 'em like this anymore.",Sunset Blvd.
242,Tashtago,Gave it another chance still don't like it...,5,18 August 2013,"Tried to watch it again last night with the same result. I just simply don't care about either Norma Desmond or Joe Gillie. Gloria Swanson is just too hideous to look at . All that clenched teeth, bugged out eyes,and spider like movements. It's a great performance I suppose, but not one that in any way gains sympathy.If anything she's repulsive. Holden is Holden. If you like him you probably like the movie. I'm not a Holden fan but I thought the film would be great in spite of him. Like for example Bridge on the River Kwai. However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath. Holden's narrator continually interrupts to tell us what is going on. All in all Sunset Blvd. is one classic that doesn't hold up.",Sunset Blvd.
243,Chuck-149,Holden was robbed at the Oscars.,9,18 September 1999,"After reading my summary, I know that some of you that are fans of Jose Ferrer are going to write some bad stuff about me and what I've said which I do expect.  Only hear make sure you know what I mean when I say Holden was robbed.  I'm not saying that Ferrer wasn't good in ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", I'm saying Holden was a lot better in ""Sunset boulevard"".  The reason I'm saying this is simply because throughout the movie, you think that there is no William Holden in the movie, that there was simply Joe Gillis playing himself through the whole movie and I'm not just talking about his acting, but his look and the voice-over especially, made you think that Joe Gillis made a movie about a part of his life.  Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-and-out script writer who owes everybody some money, especially his insurance company which has had enough of waiting for him to pay and threatens to take his car if he doesn't pay on that day.  Naturally, Joe doesn't pay and decides to leave town for a while to let things cool-off.  But as he is leaving, he runs into the men from the insurance company and so they run after Joe on a road that leads far out of town and luckily for Joe, as he is in a rather sharp turn, he hits a nail and drives his car directly into a lost driveway losing the boys from the insurance company.  Joe has no clue where he is.  In fact, he thinks he is in an abandoned house's driveway.  But as he approaches the garage, a man comes out of the main house claiming that ""Madame"" is expecting him.  Joe doesn't know what the man is talking about but enters the mansion as he is asked to and follows the man upstairs where he meets ""Madame"".  Now being a script writer, Joe recognizes ""Madame"".  She is in fact the star of the silent movies, the great Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson).  But Mrs. Desmond thinks that Joe is the undertaker who is there to bury her dead monkey.  Joe explains the misunderstanding and asks if he could just borrow a spare tire and he would be on his way.  But Mrs. Desmond refuses because she wants Joe to polish off the script she has written and that she wants to show to Cecil B. DeMille so he can direct it.  And so her servant Max (Erich Von Stroheim) shows Joe to his room and he begins to work as a gigolo for Mrs. Desmond.  Masterfully directed and acted, this is one film-noir you won't want to miss.  Personally, I felt that Holden and Wilder did a better job with ""Stalag 17"" but ""Sunset boulevard"" is still an American classic.  It was good to see Gloria Swanson back in action again.  She was very good looking in this movie and played her part very well.  But it is really the Holden-Wilder team that makes ""Sunset boulevard"" so good.  The movie leads to a great ending and the filming is excellent during the whole movie.  It's one of my favorite movies made by the great Billy Wilder and starring the exceptional William Holden.  This one you really don't want to miss.",Sunset Blvd.
244,SimonHeide,Glamour and Self-deception.,9,17 April 2008,"I really want to applaud this movie for being courageous and far, far ahead of its time. It shows the result of how a ""lovely girl at the age of seventeen"" is being turned into the most hideous monster one can imagine. And how does this come about? Simply by being a star and thereby becoming delusional about her own importance. It can probably be a very hard lesson to learn that you can be adored by the crowds and the next minute forgotten. And if you have build your identity up around being a star what do you have left if and when this happens? Absolutely nothing except your memories and the hope of returning to the screen. In the case of Norma Desmond you immediately sense how unrealistic the hope of returning to the screen is and you are horrified by her appearance which suggests to you that she is still playing one of her silent movies roles where it was important to ""overplay"" since there was no dialogue. Gloria Swanson is gruesome to watch in this role – this is acting on a level that you rarely see.Then she adds an incredible depth to her part as she shows us how vulnerable she feels towards Joe Gillis who in return is torn between contempt and some sort of affection towards her. Her servant helps her building up a world of illusion and he finally succeeds in giving her what she wants; to play a part in front of the rolling cameras; It doesn't get more ""noir"" than this.Recommend this without any hesitation.Regards Simon",Sunset Blvd.
245,jared-25331,The greatest film-based movie of all time!,10,2 October 2019,"I can't believe I never had the chance to watch this film for a long time, but I've recently seen it and it's a masterpiece.",Sunset Blvd.
246,Holdjerhorses,Greatest star of them all?,10,3 January 2005,"I just watched SB again -- three times -- this past week, for perhaps the 100th time.The film is virtually flawless, IMHO. (Except for the distracting shadow of the camera on William Holden's back as he moves to Norma's bed to wish her, ""Happy New Year, Norma . . . ,"" a technical flaw I've never understood: why wasn't the move re-lit and re-shot, since everything else in the film is perfect?) But what continues to haunt me is Swanson's performance. Her silent-screen ""theatricality"" is always remarked upon. Yet there are several moments of utterly contemporary ""naturalism"" that show she knew exactly what she was doing as an actress (and Wilder, as director).Her sweetness in her ""bathing beauty"" scene, where she recounts her days in the line with Marie Prevost and Mabel Normand, then leaps onto the sofa beside William Holden -- is so beguiling that you completely understand her sex appeal and warmth (for a moment). When she asks for his match (for a moustache for her Chaplin impression) and tells Holden to close his eyes, ""Close 'em!"" -- the ""Close 'em!"" is clearly an ad lib that is so real and intimate that it is almost instantly lost in the macabre sequence that follows -- all flashing eyes and volcanic eruption that C.B. DeMille himself hasn't phoned her.Soon afterward, believing she will be making ""Salome"" for DeMille, there is the astonishing montage of Norma's marathon beauty treatments in preparation for her ""return."" Extreme closeups of Swanson's face, without makeup, reveal a still-youthful, lovely woman with flawless skin. Even under the magnifying glass, even with the ""worried"" expression of Norma Desmond, Swanson is stunningly beautiful for a few moments. Ironically, for the rest of the picture, she had to be made up to look older. Yet here we get a glimpse of the real Swanson at 50-whatever, and she looks merely a few years older than Holden.Finally, the entire sequence when Holden returns to find Swanson phoning Betty Shaefer to tell her the truth about Joe Gillis, Swanson is in cold-cream and ""wings"" to smooth her cheeks and eyes -- an actress completely exposed and without vanity.She plays the entire sequence ""naturalistically"" and in complete contrast to her theatrical, ""I AM big. It's the pictures that got small,"" style.Here, in her bed, caught by Holden, realizing she's going to lose him, she begs him, ""Look at me!"" The desperation and helplessness, the momentary admission of reality as Norma acknowledges her fears and insecurities and pleads with Holden, are heartbreaking. Swanson's playing in the scene is astonishingly courageous for any actress, and deeply true to the character.Finally, as Joe packs to leave her and Swanson pleads with him to stay -- grabbing his luggage and begging, ""What do you want? Money?"" -- again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness, yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.Everyone tends to remember Swanson's over-the-top stylized performance: yet her total control as an actress, and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness, however fleeting, are something to behold.Swanson's is truly one of the most astonishing performances on film. Her range here is jaw-dropping.Watch her transitions in the Chaplin scene alone, in one continuous take, from heart-rending comedy to blind rage. No cutaways. Amazing.I happened to see Swanson live at the Huntington Hartford Theatre in Hollywood, on Vine, in the late sixties, in a stage show written especially for her, called ""Reprise."" This piece-of-fluff comedy about a famous movie star returning to her home town was hardly Tony-Award winning. But from her first entrance, you were in the presence of a great actress.Barely five feet tall, she swept in and immediately established a bodily ""line"" that commanded attention from then on.Her performance was delightful. Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&A session at the local Rotary Club.Swanson walked down steps and into the actual audience, greeting ""old friends"" (that night's audience members), reminiscing about her career -- even sitting in a man's lap and ""teasing"" him for not remembering when they ""dated"" -- as real film clips from her silents played on a giant screen onstage.She was outrageous and girlish (she was approaching 70 at the time) and delightful, poking fun at herself and her ""character's"" career.It was a brilliant bit of stagecraft and an impressive revelation of the ""real"" Gloria Swanson.Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth ""young fellow"" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.Swanson was the antithesis of Norma Desmond. She was entrancing, magical, adorable, and everybody wanted to take her home.Honestly, perhaps the only other two live theatrical performances I've ever seen (and I've seen hundreds) that could compare to Swanson's sheer talent and charisma were Maggie Smith in ""Lettuce and Loveage"" and Vanessa Redgrave in ""Orpheus Descending."" Believe it.Not every actor understands the difference between film and stage performance, nor can every actor deliver that difference vocally and physically (this was WAY before the days of amplified body mikes). Swanson did.I was in first grade when ""Sunset Boulevard"" was released. I was in my 20s when I saw Swanson onstage in ""Reprise"" in Hollywood.You could still see the magic that had made her the global phenomenon she had been in silents. You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with ""Sunset Boulevard"" three decades later.You could understand where Billy Wilder got his line: ""She was the greatest star of them all."" Every time I watch SB, I think: ""She probably damned well was.""",Sunset Blvd.
247,Criticalstaff,The golden age of silent film from the point of view of classic Hollywood,8,16 July 2020,"The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is how modern it feels. I am amazed of how metatextual the film is. I always thought that meta is a much modern device. In a way you could rationalize, especially when culture and media become more ubiquitous and easy to access, that every story has been told. All the plots are rehashed and every trope has been established, therefore the last refuge is being meta: the commentary on it.In my opinion its not even limited to cinema, and maybe that is why this movie surprised me so much, but most of culture and art form in general. And it might be a consequence of the abundance of art and culture. This is by the way best exemplified in movies like Star Wars and other series. When it came out, it was only thing available; now every movie rips it off, like Guardian of the Galaxy, or pays homage, like the new Star Wars. The only original and fresh avenue is parody, pastiche or deconstruction.The movie's gimmick of looking back to a forgotten era of movie making and commenting on it, is eerie to us because it gives the viewer a similar experience. Or more accurately it is a mise en abyme that is so well executed that you almost forget the movie is more than half a century old.
On the technical side the movie is flawless, of course, yet it also lends the movie to be a horror story/monster movie of sorts, with Norma being the Monster. But it really shows the finesse of Billy Wilder who able to create this inverted fairytale, which is also a social drama, and a commentary on Hollywood, all at the same time. Without being overtly explicit and hitting you on the head.It is easy to see why this movie has become a cult classic. It is because it is a golden age movie looking back at a previous golden age. It is like watching Back to Future in 2015 and looking at the 1950 through the lens of the 80s. And it works because the core message stays true and relevant. The movie business of the silent era is the movie business of the 1950s, and it the one of today. The movie is still big it's the other movie that have gotten small.",Sunset Blvd.
248,tjsdshpnd,Gloria Swanson shines in yet another Wilder classic,9,17 September 2009,"Billy Wilder is widely considered as one of the most decorated directors of the golden black and white era with movies such as Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, Double Indemnity etc. But Sunset Blvd may be his best creation. The movie starts with a man lying dead in a swimming pool of a huge villa located in Sunset Boulevard, a prime location in Hollywood where movie stars dwell. The viewers are then taken into flashback explaining the events that led to his death. The flashback takes the viewer into a roller-coaster ride into the insides of Hollywood and the sad condition of yesteryear's silent actors who have been long forgotten and live the life of a recluse. The movie ends in such a manner that the viewer is forced to have sympathy on the person who killed that man.William Holden as a struggling writer portrays the 'Will do anything for success' part excellently. Erich Stroheim as the Butler cum Yesteryear Director Cum First Husband of a Matinée Idol lives his part. But Gloria Swanson takes the cake as far as the performance is concerned. Her portrayal as a yesteryear silent movie super-star who fans have forgotten makes us feel for her. Her struggle to convince herself that she is still (At 50) the biggest superstar around with millions of fans wanting her to comeback leads her to live the life of a recluse which finally makes her mentally unstable. Overall, a classic not to be missed.Rating : 9/10",Sunset Blvd.
249,cafescott,Falling Stardom,9,20 July 2014,"***Jonny_Numb (""A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain"", Jonny_Numb from Hellfudge, Pennsylvania, 21 August 2006) has a well-written, witty summary. Also, SpaceComics (""Classic character drama"", SpaceComics from Colorado, 24 September 2005) also has interesting points to make, mentioning the parodies put on by Carol Burnett.***""Sunset Boulevard,"" (1950, Billy Wilder﻿), a tale of falling stardom narrated by a dead guy﻿, is poignant. To understand it today we have to recall that silent movie actors in the 1920s were living legends in the eyes of adoring film fans around the world. Also, at the half-way mark of the twentieth century there were still film studios that employed full-time labor (paying living wages) in a variety of supporting positions, allowing undiscovered talent the opportunity to climb the ranks. There was so much general excitement about Hollywood's contribution to world culture in 1950 that Billy Wilder's depiction of a mentally disturbed, former movie star undoubtedly rankled some of his peers.When Joe Gillis (William Holden) meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), both aspire a higher station in Hollywood. Gillis, a hack screenwriter experiencing tough times, is being chased by repo men who want his car. Gillis arrives at Norma's decaying, seemingly unoccupied mansion out of sheer desperation. Gillis is fairly likable, but when given the opportunity he takes what he needs from others. Norma, who surrounds herself with photographs from her youth (i.e., early publicity pics of comely Gloria Swanson﻿), is not well. She spends her days obsessed with the adulation she used to receive and cannot accept the reality that her film career is kaput. (BTW, for six years Gloria Swanson was the leading attraction at Paramount Pictures﻿.) Gillis becomes a kept man, accepting Norma's gifts and eventually becoming her lover. As Gillis rises in stature, it is inevitable that he will want more than he has. Temptation arrives in the form of Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), the youthful script girl and fiancé of Joe's close friend Artie (Jack Webb). Betty aspires to be a screenwriter, wants to team up professionally with Joe, and her eyes light up like firecrackers when she states her intention to do the hard work needed to break through. It is very likely that (director and second-listed screenwriter) Billy Wilder created Betty to represent his dream love. She sure is mine.A very memorable character is Norma's butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim﻿). Max faithfully serves the decaying Norma, maintaining her illusion of aristocracy (that silent film stars knew for real). Max suffers almost unendurably, but never receives any attention for doing so. Regarding that Stroheim had some great success as an actor and a director, this role perfectly submerges him. This is also seen with the cameos by Buster Keaton﻿, Hedda Hopper, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. Considering Keaton's real-life stature as a silent-era superstar, watching the legendary comedian in advanced years quietly playing Bridge in that decrepit room reminds us that Time never plays favorites.This is arguably Billy Wilder's best effort as a director. He does a very good job with the mansion interiors, creating a mysterious and suspenseful feeling. (One quibble with the writing is the name-dropping, particularly early on.) Gloria Swanson should have won an Academy Award for her fearless, often-imitated performance of Norma. William Holden﻿ plays the opportunistic Joe Gillis with complexity. Nancy Olson as Betty is simply adorable. While the cast is very strong overall, I do have some disagreement with the multiple scenes with Cecil B. DeMille﻿ portraying himself which serve to make him appear thoughtful and sensitive to Norma's problems. (Was Billy Wilder trying to kiss DeMille's rear end?) Overall, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a very rich experience for audience members who still daydream about working in peak Hollywood. Cinephiles should have their chauffeur steer their Isotta-Fraschini over to the next revival theater that shows it.",Sunset Blvd.
250,hhfarm-1,How do movies this bad,3,14 April 2006,"get to be so famous. This is dull to the point of excruciation. The characters ham, overact, yell, and waste your time in every conceivable manner.Wilder was one of the worst of Hollywood writer-directors. His premise seemed to be that the stupidity of the American public required movies to hammer home a simple script and obvious plot by stating and restating the obvious.The best is the narration. 1st of all, it's narrated by a guy who dies. Why does it escape us that a dead guy can't narrate? A framed tale requires a live storyteller.. American Beauty has the same flaw. 2nd, and more important, it's narration for the sake of it ""I was tired so I decided to go out for a bit. I walked down the stairs, opened the door, went down the path to the car. I turned the handle to open the door and got in. I started the engine and backed the car out of the garage."" Whew, that helped me.This is a Film Noir? Because it's in black & white and is narrated? Because Holden is a guy on the fringes of society and wore suits with padded shoulders. What a joke.This is a hard-hitting and negative look at Hollywood? And that's why it only got 3 awards? Please. It got awards because Hollywood knew - as it knows so well now - how to make movies that other Hollywood types will weep about. Who cares what Hollywood thinks about itself?There were so many brilliant films coming out of Europe and Japan by 1950. But Hollywood was plying us with pap.

251,RARubin,Dripping with Edgy Cynicism,10,7 April 2005,"Film Noir, as it was filmed in black and white in the late 40's, early 50's is divided into three distinct categories. For the lowbrow, there is the brilliant Detour, so primitive and shot so cheaply, yet delivering a massive result. Then there is The Big Heat with Glenn Ford, a middlebrow film with the dark shadows, tragedy, and cynicism of Noir. Finally, for the highbrows, we have Billy Wilder's finest film, a true landmark dripping with edgy cynicism by a man that lost his parents to the Holocaust.In Sunset Boulevard, William Holden gives his finest performance. Holden is a very likable man and that comes through on the screen no matter which role he performs, but always that All-American persona, that likability leaks to the screen. Part of this quality is his obvious intelligence. As Norma Desmond's kept man, he knows it's wrong, at times it's downright creepy, but he works with Billy Wilder's vision and melds a bizarre group of Hollywood types into an indictment of the industry up to 1950.Are exploitation, money grubbing, and the status quest pertaining only to the early era of Hollywood? I don't think so. Ha, ha, ask Jessica Simpson, Jana Jamison, Michael Jackson, adnauseam.Gloria Swanson is a great actress. She lures Joe Gillis like a black widow spider. Her delirium is a cross between silent movie actress and Betty Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Perhaps Davis got the idea from Gloria's earlier film. Curiously, Betty's 1950 picture All About Eve won the Oscar. It is a fine film, but SB scared the studio heads, indeed horrified them, and the picture was passed over. Anyhow, this was a comeback for Swanson and she went for it. I don't know if she did a lot of work after this film, but it solidified her reputation as a Prima-Donna film actress. Her performance is unforgettable.Also kudos for Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nora's butler, ex-husband, and first director. Stroheim indeed was a fine silent film director and remarkable in Renoir's Grand Illusion. This fellow looks like he was born to wear the Kaiser's helmet.Finally, Nancy Olsen, pulled from obscurity, a college girl from Wisconsin, she is lovely as Holden's inspiration, and love interest. Her wholesomeness certainly contrasted with all the other grubby Hollywood types in the film.I have seen thousand's of films; many are of very high quality. I can't rattle them all off for you, but SB is in the top 25. Think about that!",Sunset Blvd.

This is a movie that after more than 50 years still has great power. And I think it will remain. Just the fact that ""Sunset Blvd."" really includes Paramount Pictures, Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim makes it so real and in the same time beyond reality. And who produced this picture? Paramount Pictures! Is it an impossible thing to happen today? When Norma and Joe watches a movie you can see what it is: Queen Kelly - one of the last silent movies, directed by von Stroheim and casted by Gloria Swanson ... Billy Wilder shows that the end isn't the only important thing in a movie. It is most of all the way to the end. ""Sunset Blvd."" is like a journey, and there is not only the characters in 'Sunset Blvd.' who has a development - it is most of all also a development for us, the audience, if we understand it. And I think we should. Rating: 10 of 10.",Sunset Blvd.
253,moonmonday,"Okay, definitely not great",3,3 May 2015,"It was okay.Gloria Swanson stole every scene she was in, and her expressive slightly overacting perfectly reflected her character, a performer from an age where vivid facial emotion was crucial in the absence of spoken dialogue. Eric von Stroheim plays an understated role and provides a strong, often silent presence. And William Holden is pretty, but not much else.Honestly, the only person who is remotely sympathetic or identifiable is Swanson's character of Norma Desmond, and the rest are fairly awful, aside from Stroheim's Max, who is basically very interesting scenery; I was pretty sad to reach the end and feel that everyone had basically come away with more or less just desserts. Holden's character was especially difficult to like and seemed to choose, at any given time, the worst and most idiotic possible choice of action.Was this Wilder's attempt at self-parody? Some parts of it would seem to be more satirical than serious, and the whole thing was entirely over the top. It could work as a Gothic tongue-in- cheek work, something like the Addams Family meets the silent age of film, which had aged past its prime.Perhaps it's just that the premise and the characters that populate it cannot really be seen the way they might have been in 1951. Desmond and Max's pathos and need for love and companionship juxtaposed with their isolation in a decaying yet still darkly splendid palace cannot fail to draw sympathy and interest. But Holden's Joe is just a stupid schmuck with a pretty face who never does anything right and was a poor choice for a protagonist.Ultimately it's hard to feel anything for him, though part of that may be the truly asinine choice to begin a film knowing your protagonist is...well, see for yourself. Or don't. It's good for a watch. I don't think I'll ever need to see it again.",Sunset Blvd.

Prior to this, swanson was a famous actor in the silent era of Hollywood, almost like Norma Desmond in the film, but with the arrival of sound films, their aura gradually faded and they were slowly forgotten by fans, who were only trapped in the luxurious old houses of Hollywood, showing the films they had been in over and over again. So the film 24 times per second lie (at that time should be 16 lattice) is no longer for the audience, for those who have been out of the studio, lose box office appeal (also means that the audience) yesterday as well as movie stars, they stubbornly immersed in their weaving a dream is not willing to wake up, is cruel, everyone else is awake.",Sunset Blvd.
255,Calysta,THE film that speaks Old Hollywood!,10,13 January 2000,"The film industry obviously did not know what had hit it when Billy Wilder's masterpiece was released in 1950. Fifty years later, such mastery in craftmanship still shows by still being fresh and alive, evident from the first of the unforgettable reels when William Holden's character, an unknown writer, is lying face down and dead in the pool of an extremely possessive star of the silent screen. Although not my favourite of Billy Wilder's works, (""Witness for the Prosecution"" is my own special favourite), this was not actually the first time he had stirred Hollywood. ""The Lost Weekend"", a film more scarce in its circulation but just as brilliant, had five years before almost lost a release because the type of slap-in-the-face reality was something audiences were unused to. And it eventually went on to be the best picture of 1945. However, by casting light on an industry still even seen today as the perfection of life, the Paramount studios caused an uproar from coast to coast.One of the more interesting contenders at the Oscars ""Sunset"" had that year was ""All About Eve"". The Bette Davis/Anne Baxter film did eventually take the coveted prize best picture prize, but it is obvious that ""Eve"" too runs along pretty similar lines, but instead of shattering the myth about the golden days of the silver screen which went for the throat, the 20th Century Fox executives gave it a gentler shape by provocatively going after the theatre. Haunting music and even the black and white cinematography made me feel I was in for a special ride as the opening credits rolled. William Holden was in one of his best roles. This movie unfortunately made Gloria Swanson be better remembered by us as the tragic aging movie queen of the silent era, who was one of the many actors and actresses who phased out as the sound picture experiments became a sensation. Featured also are Erich von Stroheim as the first husband turned servant and Nancy Olsen as the young girl writing collaborator. All four received Academy Award nominations, though none won. Cecil B. De Mille, one of the great directors of the silent era puts in an appearance on the featured Paramount lot as himself.The screen play, as in all great Billy Wilder movies, is gripping and fiercely brilliant. Just some of the emotions captured on film, and some of the darker imagery has made it one of the best films of the 1950s, and one of the best movies in Hollywood history. ""Singin' In the Rain"" may have made it better known to us with the use of colour, dance and song, but it did not even go anywhere near ""Sunset"" despite the bitter sweet sensation the musical gem leaves. Deservedly so, this cinematic genius is first rate.Rating: 10/10",Sunset Blvd.
256,jameslinton-75252,A Hollywood Classic about the fleeting nature of fame,7,2 May 2016,"This film was a great commentary on the superficial and fleeting nature of fame. Joe Gillis, a down on his luck screenwriter, happens upon the one-time Hollywood Gem Norma Desmond who sees Gillis as a way to relaunch her flagging film-career. Hollywood Boulevard brilliantly portrays the harsh and brutal nature of Hollywood. It is pathetic seeing Norma Desmond, sitting in the dark watching her old films, but it is also poignant and sad too. She was once a massive Hollywood star, but now everybody has even forgotten that she existed. To be launched into fame and then to have this fame taken away from you would be difficult to deal with for anyone let alone a has-been actress like Norma Desmond.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/GpaqvS",Sunset Blvd.
257,philip-ct,Don't let the sun go down....,10,3 March 2006,"This is a gem of a film: wonderful acting from William Holden (as a struggling scriptwriter in Hollywood), a mesmerising performance from Gloria Swanson (as a faded ""silent"" star, yet to come to terms with the ""talkies"") and very good support from Erich von Strheim (as the faithful manservant) and Nancy Ohlson (as Gillis'(Holden's)girlfriend.)It is a mesmerising film: even the over-the-top performances are measured! At once a mystery-thriller, social comment, satire, drama with touches of comedy, this film really impresses. This is a timeless classic, a brilliantly insightful commentary on Hollywood.Yet the film isn't only cerebral: there is an emotional facet to it. I was amazed, enraptured. Get the DVD: the special features are excellent, too.",Sunset Blvd.
258,Paul-271,Another Historical Document,8,29 October 2008,"Clearly a 10 star movie when current, the film today is more a document of times gone past than a gripping drama. The reason is simple - our society today isn't anything at all like it was in 1950 or so. The tension created by the (then) inverted relationship shown between male and female lacks any traction today. So this movie is today enjoyable as a window of what society thought proper over 50 years go. Swanson gives a superb performance which many take as over the top chewing the scenery today. However, you need to keep in mind that the sort of excessive emoting she does in this movie is stylistically in tune with the way silent stars needed to act to get their message across. Yes, I agree with those who've said the plot is silly, outlandish and contrived. So what? The plot only exists as a vehicle so the movie about relationships can exist. I'd suppose the enjoyment of this movie would be proportional to your age. A 75 year old personally remembers those times and would find it personally interesting. A 50 year old would have heard of those times and find it interesting in what he missed. A 15 year old would view the movie as a bizarre bore unless he were a student of history or the movies. A good accompanying movie to this one would be 'Detective Story' with Kirk Douglas - again from the same time period. Like here, the tension generated by the central story is laughable by today's standards, but resonated with audiences way back then.",Sunset Blvd.
259,lale-ba,OL' SCHOOL DRAMA,5,27 April 2018,"When you combine Billy Wilder behind and Gloria Swanson and William Holden in front of the camera you can not get a mediocre result. Semi-autobiographical story about the fallen star of silent movies that struggles to catch up with the moving industry perplexed with a love story and a crime mystery, you get a really decent movie with some dramatic depth. 
On the other hand, the praise it received were mainly due to the moment it appeared, thus being really up to date with its display of the changing cinematography.
""Sunset Boulevard"" is a good ol' school drama, but with a somewhat obsolete subject",Sunset Blvd.
260,Primtime,Classic Hollywood,8,10 March 1999,"Not too many films could personify all that is Hollywood quite like this film. This film speaks Hollywood, shows Hollywood, cries Hollywood and dies Hollywood. Billy Wilder tried harder than any of his other film while making this one and it sure shows.The story of the aging film star that still lives in the past was something like a tribute to an era that even in the 50's had long lost its luster. Gloria Swanson in the best role of her career plays Norma Desmond, the silent screen star who is in the process of writing a script for a film to be directed by Cecil B DeMille, or at least she believes so. Norma entails the help of a younger man named Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), who in a bit of desparation of his own, decides to alter her script for her in return for money and a place to live.The haunting mansion that Desmond lives in with only her butler Max (Erich von Stronheim) shows only pictures of her, has a screen onto which her films are shown to her weekly and plays host to other former silent film stars (notably Buster Keaton in a surprise cameo), is a reminder of how time passed Norma by. Norma tries, though in vain to make Joe love her as she loves him. She even goes through the trouble of having a small orchestra play all night on New Year's Eve just for the two of them. When Joe asks when all of the other people are going to arrive, Norma responds ""this is a special evening, this is our evening."" From here on we see to what lengths Norma will go to show Joe how much she loves him, regardless of the fact that he does not love her.Joe is eventually approached by a script reader, Betty, (Nancy Olsen) that finds some potential in one of his older scripts and offers to work with him to bring it up to par. The only problem is the close grip that Norma has around him. Joe knows that he can only sneak away at night since Norma doesn't want him to be away from her for any amount of time. Joe leaves frequently to work with Betty, all the while falling in love with her.The tragic ending in this film reminded me of the one in ""The Great Gadsby."" It is another example of love gone wrong when a man should have been with the girl he loved, however, the circumstances he is in simply won't let him.I fully enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all. This film is truly one of the all time greats.8/10 stars.",Sunset Blvd.
261,kalbimassey,Gloria's Swansong,8,12 January 2021,"Some artists do not enjoy watching themselves in performance. Often seeking seclusion and shying away from the glare of publicity. At the opposite end of the spectrum are the self absorbed, obsessed and enveloped by their own importance.Sunset Blvd.'s Gloria Swanson is one such figure. Twenty years past her sell-by date, but still wallowing in her once glittering career as a silent star. Existing as a recluse, with only servant Erich von Stroheim for company. Driven by the fantasy of a glorious return to the screen.Enter floundering, creatively bankrupt hack, William Holden, who realizes too late that not scrounging, scraping and scrimping the outstanding payment on his car proves to be a costly mistake. A wardrobe full of expensive clothes and a primarily liquid diet of vintage champagne cannot disguise the fact that by parking his ailing automobile in Swanson's garage he has become imprisoned in her bizarre, unreal world.Holden's onerous task of transforming Swanson's muddled, woeful scripts into a marketable finished product for Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount, in order to rekindle the all but forgotten star's career, is nothing short of a' silk purse from a sow's ear' undertaking. Throw in the added ingredient of Swanson's constant meddling and it descends into a challenge as thankless as polishing a cowpat. Meanwhile, Swanson remains blissfully ignorant of the fact that both she and the industry that once embraced her, have both changed beyond recognition.Overlong, overrated and occasionally overbearing Wilder's dark satire nonetheless, presents a unique insider's view of a Hollywood on the brink of the big collapse. Studio-bound and stagy, seven decades on Sunset Bvld. has lost much of the universal potency and paramount importance evident at the time of its release. Notwithstanding, it remains an incisive statement on the mercurial nature of stardom and the potential damage it can wreak upon those who become intoxicated by its allure. Largely determined by the capricious complexion of audience response. One day you're up and the next.....you're doing an Imodium ad!",Sunset Blvd.
262,gerry-russell-139,One of the great scary movies,10,7 October 1999,"I first saw this movie last year ('98) around the Christmas season. It may not have been the best time of year to see it (Halloween would have best) but it was still worth a look either time. I love Gloria Swanson's scary, almost evil plot to take over William Holden's mind and making him her ""property"". You feel there is a chance he and Nancy Olsen's character will be able to get away from her and live their lives in peace together but the story is a tragedy so there has to be some disappointments. Norma (Swanson) refuses to let Joe (Holden) go but he still persists and she kills him. The audience tends to pity Norma for losing her career in the movies and for desperately trying to hold on to it (she surrounds herself with old publicity pictures of herself for comfort) even though it's dead and has no chance of redemption. After killing Holden, she practically becomes oblivious to the deed and suffocates herself into believing, ""I am the greatest star there ever was"". It is a great American classic. The greatest scary movie ever made!",Sunset Blvd.
263,gentendo,Theme through Production Design,10,5 November 2007,"The production design of this film helped convey the stories main theme: When a person refuses to detach from their former and forgotten identity, not only is their progression damned, but the potential to be manipulative, codependent, and obsessive reign supreme in order to keep the illusion alive.Struggling screen writer, Joe Gillis, meets by way of happenstance the former silent-screen goddess, Norma Desmond. Norma is an aged woman who has lived quietly and practically alone for many years in her spacious and what seems like deserted mansion; fooling herself into believing that the world is ready for her ""return"" (not ""comeback"") to the millions of fans who have never forgiven her for deserting the screen so many years ago. Norma's refusal to detach from her former and forgotten identity as a big Hollywood star is dramatically heightened through the use of production design.The predominant set used throughout this film is Norma's spacious mansionan environment that suggests luxury and comfort for a woman who is still living off of the money she waged through a former identity. The illusory and narcissistic life that Norma continues to live is heightened through the heavy use of mise-en-scene. Framed pictures and portraits of Norma's face are displayed all throughout her mansionmost of which capture moments of past films she's acted in. She even has her own movie theater where she shows Joe the old films that she starred in. As she romanticizes and woos over her past, Joe, as well as the viewer, becomes aware of her inability to divorce herself from her former identity.Her bedroom also expresses the illusion she is under through elegancy. From a throne-like bed with silk draped from corner to corner, to fluffy and intricate pillows, exotic plants and decorative mirrors, all of these props are used to help convey to the viewer Norma's obsession with her past. In short, she is living a lie. Her stylish material possessions are what keep her from progressing onward with her life. She seems content with living in the past and will object to anyone that tries to disturb her comfort zone (as seen when she kills Joe in the enda man she fell in love with and had difficulty detaching herself from after he walked out on her, thus disturbing her comfort zone).Along with the props, her striking wardrobe is also effectively contrasted with the rest of the characters in the film. While she is clothed in expensive and fancy attire, Joe is dressed in rugged slacks and tattered buttoned shirts. There is a scene where Norma merges her own identity crisis onto Joe when she takes him shopping for new clothes. This was her way of subconsciously manipulating her own ideologies of her forgotten identity onto someone elsethe intended purpose, of course, was for her to perpetuate her narcissistic influence into those that would succumb to her manipulation. The use of make-up is also exploited to dramatize the main theme. In order for Norma to retain her old self, she undergoes extensive beauty treatments in preparation for her ""return"". Extreme close-ups reveal an ageless and beautiful woman, yet ironically throughout the rest of the film she is exposed as she really isan old and wrinkled woman who is attempting to hold onto something that has past.",Sunset Blvd.

He never finds the money that he needs and while one day driving in road he sees the men who ask for payment priorly. Running away from those men, tyre of Joe Gillis' tyre goes off and he has to drive in a old large estate where an old film star accommodate. This star is Norma Desmond and she shares the big house with his servant Max who is her first husband. Desmond wants to patronize Gillis and he is wanted to edit Desmond's story. Gillis is obliged to accept this proposal but by the time he follows other jobs and Desmont believes lots of people are still fan of her, but she doesn't know the reality that Max writes those letters to her.Anyway,Desmont goes to an old director for a new film but she doesn't know that she is called for her old car upon using in a film. Desmont also envies Gillis and she disturbs his partner for a project by calling her.Till this point, the film is very boring so that I can play Solitaire in a small window at the same time. But the last three minutes are very creative in which Joe invites her friend and partner Betty to face up with reality. He rejects Betty and after that also Norma. Norma shoots him while leaving the house and he falls down to the pool.Police, journalists and Paramount pictures immediately come to the event place and an artificial film is made in event place as she wanted.

It's most definitely worth a watch and the final scene is something I can definitely relate to more now that I see where the famous quote actually comes from.

266,Bry-2,"A great, great film",9,6 January 2003,"This is a Wilder classic, and that's saying a lot.  One of the first movies to really skewer the business end of Hollywood, this film was not popular with the studios or with the ""rank and file"" in the business.  It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to All About Eve, which played on similar themes but with a Broadway setting (safer for a movie to criticise!).  The performances are all first rate, especially the leads but also the innocent script-reader, played by ... well, I've forgotten her name.  Nancy Olsen?  Something wholesome lime that.  She was excellent, and this film, if popular, should have made her a Star, but since I can't recall her name, it's somewhat obvious it didn't.Even the supporting cast was great -- C.B. DeMille, as himself, brought a truth to his role, and great sympathy for Norma Desmond, the forgotten diva, probably based on his real-life working relationship with Gloria Swanson, who did indeed do some of her finest work with him, in his pre-Biblical-spectacular days.Any who haven't seen this film HAVE TO, NOW!  It's entertaining, suspenseful (even though you know Holden's fate from the first minutes), funny, eerie, and wonderful.  The exteriors used for Desmond's mansion have fallen just into the right stage of decay ... the pool looks unkempt and decrepit (even though it was built specifically for the film!) ... the huge 1926 limosine, though gorgeous, is perfectly cast as the kind of limo -- with the leopard skin seats and flower vases -- that Norma Desmond *would* have bought in 1926, when $28,000 was at least ten times harder to earn than it is today.Highly recommended.

Think about it: if Norma Desmond's life isn't in it's final stages by the time her boytoy pops up on her doorstep, then we may as well agree with her apparent belief that she's never going to die. Max (played by silent era film giant Erich Von Stronheim; when he talks of the three great silent directors, all they did was change the name for his role), who discovered, married, and now serves Norma passed his high noon in films long before. Then there's William Holden, who doesn't realize that his life and career are entering the last stages, right up until the fatal bullets hit him from behind (do you honestly think that he could tell this story so objectively until then?).""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.""

Twenty years passed before I saw it again, but all those years it stuck with me. There was the man floating dead in the pool, but telling me this story, the mysterious funeral for the dead monkey, the old people sitting around playing bridge, von Stroheim flitting in and out, menacing to a boy my age, and bug-eyed Norma descending the stairs.It is a movie obsessed with death, but aren't most of our great films? Joe Gillis is like the female lead in a Gothic novel. 'Don't go in that house, Joe' but he does, and he meets the wicked witch, except she is dressed like Charlie Chaplin and she has real talent, while Gillis is no more than an interloper, an uninvited guest who does not come out the other side in the end.It was the first film I remember seeing, and will always remain my favorite.And of Wilder, the Viennese cynic?

But the film is about more than that. It is about the rough and perilous life that goes with any work in a business as tumultuous as Hollywood, and the unpredictable nature of celebrity.

Let me just say I wish I had watched it sooner. This has to rank as one of the greatest films ever made. EVERYTHING is perfect. The dialog, the direction, and the actors. Joe Gillis (The amazing William Holden) is a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter, about to give up his dreams of glory to move back home, when he stumbles upon the mansion of long 'retired' screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) while eluding some collection me who've come to repossess his car. A star from another time, Desmond desperately awaits the return of the limelight which has passed over her many years before. As Gillis meets her, she is a recluse in a decaying Hollywood mansion ""The type of place crazy Hollywood people built in the crazy 20's"" Her only companion her butler Max, and a recently deceased chimpanzee. After meeting Norma, Gillis is offered the chance to rewrite a script that Norma believes will be her big comeback. Seeing an opportunity to make some easy money from an obviously delusional (and very rich) woman he takes the job, but before long he is ensnared in his own prison, a kept man in every sense of the word. The script by Billy Wilder is not to be missed. The dialog is so sharp, and full of great lines that have been quoted for the last 60 years you will be amazed. The film is also chock full of symbolism, and clever plays that a second viewing is definitely in order. Highly recommended!",Sunset Blvd.
274,Eric266,A Simply Glorious Film,9,30 July 2018,"They don't make movies like this anymore. Great dialogue, well-rounded characters, excellent direction, a nice pace, and fantastic acting. I've never really followed Holden's career and I've never seen Swanson before in a movie, but these two are phenomenal.Holden is a hack writer, Joe Gillis, who literally stumbles upon washed up actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in her creepy mansion. They form a bond borne of both desperation and neediness. He needs money, she needs attention. Along the way, Joe meets Norma's butler/companion, Max, a fellow writer, Betty (Nancy Olson), and Joe's buddy, Artie (a pre-Dragnet Jack Webb).At first Joe sees this as a great way to get some money (his car is about to be repossessed). But as Norma slowly descends into madness, she starts pulling Joe with her. Ultimately, Norma completely loses her senses and Joe suffers for it. Holden and Swanson make the slow, painful descent completely believable. I'm sure there are other actors/actresses out there who could have pulled off these roles, but its hard to think of any. Holden is a smart aleck who makes jokes and writes dialogue with equal talent. Swanson is downright scary as the actress Hollywood wants to forget, but she refuses to let them off easy. She reminded me of that girlfriend who you break up with, but she refuses to accept it.I really loved the dialogue. Joe narrating the proceedings is an interesting quirk if you know the beginning of the movie (everything is told in flashbacks). The banter between the two is sometimes caring, sweet, and loving. Other times its harsh, angry and downright ugly. They both need each other, but being together is the worst thing for them.Hollywood has made some really great movies over the years.

275,Niro,In My Top Ten US Films of All Time; and Holden Was Robbed,10,26 October 1999,"For me this is Billy Wilder's [and likely Holden's] finest work, which is saying something on both counts.  And Bill was robbed of the Oscar for this remarkable performance.The only flaw in the entire film is one which echoes ""Citizen Kane's"" sole error ~Sunset: How can a dead man narrate a film?Kane: How can a dying man utter a word [""Rosebud""] in an empty room, and yet have the entire film revolve around friend and fellow newsman Cotten's search for the word's meaning?  I mean, no one actually could have heard him say the word.  Don't believe me?  Watch the beginning again ~ the nurse walks in after Kane falls down he stairs.Immaterial.Read everyone else's review of this film, because it's all been said here.It's a tour de force on every level, and not just for the [now cliched] line: ""I'm ready for my close~up, Mr. DeMille,"" nor for the fact that the past~her~prime Gloria Swanson agreed to play a has~been [unheard of at the time. even though Swanson was never really an extraordinary Hollywood figure].The kicker for me is that the extremely important early German expressionist filmmaker Erich Von Stroheim actually lowered himself to play Swanson's [Garbo~based?] character's butler/assistant, helping to keep her legend alive.This is akin to Martin Scorsese playing butler to average actress Kelly Preston 20 years from now.Holden, as the penultimate gold~digger/gigolo [albeit unwittingly at first], is simply brilliant.  As is the forever underrated Nancy Olson as his wannabe screenwriter mentee.  Despite her first~rate work here, she never appeared in another masterpiece again.Our loss.William Holden did, of course, and a case can be made for his performances in ""Bridge On The River Kwai,"" ""Stalag 17"" [Wilder again], ""Picnic,"" ""Network"" etc.But for me this was his career's defining role.

276,mirkobozic,The perils of being a nobody (again),10,17 March 2018,"""Sunset Boulevard"" is a film for ages, since its main topic is relevant today as it was in the day when the movie was made- how to deal with the fact that one is past his peak and what a devastating effect it can have on people who are used to fame and fortune, once they face the fact they no longer front page material. Here, Swanson plays a silent film diva Norma Desmond leading a secluded life in her mansion, almost a metaphor of a princess in a tower. And lo, unexpectedly there comes a prince about to save her, in the form of a failed screenwriter Joe Gills (Holden) who is on the run from his creditors. Learning that the former diva is completely out of touch with reality, he moves into the villa pretending to help her with the script for her grand comeback. He also learns that her butler Max enables her delusions by writing the letters she believes are sent by her fans. Eventually, the charade is exposed and things get out of control.This is arguably Swanson's biggest accomplishment and she deserved all the accolades she got for it. Her portrayal of a woman refusing to face the music borders on hysterical and paranoid all the time and she dominates every scene she's in. It's a lesson on character inhabiting and Holden also does his bit by giving the audience a cool, detached narrator framing the story of his own demise. Erich von Stroheim shows just how far one is willing to go to protect the woman he loves, creating a web of lies and illusions to keep his love sane. Put any other aged movie star into Norma's shoes and you'll get a similar story. The ending scene is a masterpiece.",Sunset Blvd.

What we got is a film so biting and so incisive it could still impart lessons in today's celebrity world.Gloria Swanson doesn't just steal the scene, she devours it whole as Lorna Desmond, former silent film star left in her rotting abode with her butler Max and a thousand photographs and souvenirs of a bygone era. She crosses paths with Joe Gillis (William Holden), who is escaping insurers in his broken down jalopy and happens to park at Ms. Desmond's place and a strange friendship ensues...Swanson is suitably regal as she delivers line after line to Gillis and the audience (""I'm still big, the pictures are small!"" ""We didn't NEED to talk, we had faces!"") and sinks into melodrama while still keeping the stage presence of a true star. Cecil B. DeMille appears as the overburdened director of The Ten Commandments trying to fend off Desmond's advances and her script for Salomé. the purported capping stone of her career. Meanwhile, Joe is trying to blossom a script with Betty Schaefer whose husband is away filming...it all comes to a head when she meets Joe at Lorna's and Joe walks out on Lorna, sadly for the last time as she shoots him in the back and he falls dead in her pool.""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille!"" are her last words as the mob of photographers and movie makers zoom on the radiant and crazed Lorna as she descends the stairs for one final post, screen queen to the end.A must for historical purposes or just for a look behind the scenes.

282,lukecon-63436,One of Billy Wilder's directorial gems,10,22 July 2020,"This film surely deserves the credit it gets. Billy Wilder effectively creates darkly comedic dialogue in its script. The dialogue is witty, and while dark, helps shed some humor in the midst of a dark situation--this adds to the brilliance of the dialogue.
The characters are brilliantly crafted and developed, as we understand our main characters and their motivations. We understand the perspective of our two major characters, played by William Holden and Gloria Swanson. We know more about their characteristics and their goals/motivations through their dialogue and actions.
Not only is the script great, the acting is very good. Gloria Swanson creepily plays her character with a dark but brilliant delivery of dialogue, adding to the dark atmosphere of the film. William Holden also delivers his lines just as well as Swanson does.
The production design is also very fitting for the dark and creepy atmosphere of the film--the design/decoration of sets such as the house of Norma Desmond--helps add to the frightening/dark mood of the film.
I could go on and on about what makes this movie so great--and what also makes it a must-see for movie lovers. I just hope that Hollywood doesn't make a remake out of this.",Sunset Blvd.
283,michaelheiser-25099,Good film classic noir,7,11 November 2021,"Good film classic noir. We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved.Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line.Swanson is not the only one carry an autobiographic curve in the story, so is Erich von Stroheim, as Max, her dour but loyal butler-cum-chauffeur, the only one takes care of her in the decadent manor, more shockingly is later he reveals to be Norma's first husband and the director who has brought her to stardom and accompanies her into obsolescence. In real life Mr. Von Stroheim and Ms. Swanson both suffered a career debacle after their collaboration again.",Sunset Blvd.

On one level, it's an absolute classic of Film-Noir drama. Snappy script, bitter-sweet storyline, characters you love to hate and a plucky young girl whom you root for (and really care about) and on the other level there's the wonderful blurring of real life and fantasy. Gloria Swanson (and her friends who come to play bridge) really were (for want of a better phrase) washed-up silent film stars; Erich von Stroheim really did direct Gloria Swanson before the Talkies came and ruined everything; William Holden really was a Hollywood golden boy who'd fallen out of box-office favour; even Cecil B. DeMille makes an appearance as himselfIt's just gripping. The way the melodramatic style of ""old-fashioned"" Hollywood clashes with the more ""realistic"" new Hollywood.

Sensual, yet shocking imagery and a brilliant, but meandering plot runs the gamut and lead us to the tragic conclusion. My favorite scene is the bizarre and shocking segment featuring a dead chimp. Its quirkiness is right in line with the Wilder plot that grows ever wilder with each moment.Bill Holden is exceptional as the frustrated screenwriter Joe Gillis, who latches onto washed-up silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in hope of resurrecting both their careers. Along the way, he draws co-writer Betty into his doom. Despite herself, Betty ditches a good, decent lover for the mysterious, secretive Holden.How can this mess get any messier?

The Lights, the Sounds, the Cameras- what happens when they've dissipated as the Stars of yesteryear before them? Sunset Boulevard tells a darkly satirical, yet poignant story of the once-great Norma Desmond- a washed up actress of the silent film era. A woman so consumed with delusion and narcissism that nothing in this world, nor any other could convince her of anything but her own self importance. She's a star, after all. Ironic as it may seem, Norma herself is not the fulcrum of the film, but rather one side of a dichotomy- the conflict between a bygone age, and the modern. In this place of the middle, torn between the two is our protagonist Joe Gillis- a struggling screenwriter trying to strike it big, who happens upon our old Hollywood queen. What comes next is a story that may ring true of many stars who have faded into obscurity- the paralyzing stigma of being a has been, the endless planning of an ever-just-out-of-reach comeback, and the whispers and rumors of days gone by- that yearning for the spotlight, the power, and the attention they once commanded. With a fantastic twist and slick direction, Billy Wilder delivers a hit in this timeless classic. It remains relevant and applicable still, even in today's world, sixty years removed from the original premiere. Sunset Boulevard is a narrative in how fleeting fame can be, but how the effects of it may be everlasting- in both the public eye, and in private. After all, the stars are ageless.",Sunset Blvd.
288,nutsy,"Wilder's best, Holden's best, one of the best.",10,22 October 2003,"Billy Wilder's classic SUNSET BLVD. is probably Hollywood's best self-loathing look at itself. William Holden is great as a struggling screenwriter running from his creditors who encounters has-been silent film star Gloria Swanson (who is pretty much playing herself in the guise of Norma Desmond). Her tragic character and her decaying palace of a home are very heavy and very dark, the kind of thing that only a great comedy directer like Billy Wilder could give us. Erich Von Strohiem appears as Swanson's butler who was a silent film director (as the actor was in real life). The truth of these performances is part of what makes the film's statement about Hollywood so delightfully bitter. Watching this film will prove to anyone that the hype and reputation are entirely justified. The film viewer of today can appreciate the connection to David Lynch's supposed homage MULHOLLAND DR. about another dark tale associated with another L.A. street.

He is an out of luck screenwriter who nobody seems to want to help. He meets old and now forgotten star Norma Desmond (Based on the true lives of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor). Norma has the false notion that she is still the most admired actress and she will soon have a comeback.

291,snow0r,"""And must you chew gum?""",10,14 April 2008,"It so happens that as I was watching Sunset Boulevard, I was chewing gum, and Gloria Swanson's clipped, derisive tone felt more like it was directed not at William Holden's washed up Joe Gillis in 1950, but at me, sitting on my couch in 2008. I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted. Norma Desmond knew I was chewing, and she didn't like it one bit.But this is part of Sunset Boulevard's charm. While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same. Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.While some of the period references to actors and directors went over my head - I'm no expert on the silent era - it didn't affect my enjoyment of them one bit. The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool, relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws ever-tighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for, and Swanson is pitch-perfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion, right down to the wide roving eyes and claw-like hands. They're well-supported, especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course, great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do ""old"" movies actually live up to their reputations, but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does, and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noir-drama stands the test of time. A truly great film.",Sunset Blvd.

This movie is simply the most excellent, perfect movie ever. To give it a 10 is an insult.I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film ... close to 50 would be my guess. How many movies can you watch that many times and the movie remains just as perfect, just as entertaining, just as enthralling and fascinating each time you watch it? Very few, that's for sure! Gloria Swanson was simply perfection in this movie. What a brilliant casting move on Billy Wilder's part! And what a performance Swanson gave. Her theatrics and eye movements were so dead-on ... but then what else could we expect from a genuine mega-star from the silent screen era, playing a faded mega-star from the silent screen era? What a totally unself-conscious portrayal. One of the best screen portrayals ever, in my opinion.Von Stroheim as the butler / former silent director ... again, genius. Erich von Stroheim made some GREAT pictures in his day, I mean VERY GREAT (can you say ""Greed""?), but ended up on the outs in Hollywood thanks to his legendary ego and his battles with Thalberg. How perfect to get a dethroned former major silent director to play a has-been silent director! Remember, it may be de rigeur nowadays for actors to play characters that mock their former selves (a la William Shatner and his newfound popularity), but this was half a century ago when Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson and von Stroheim pioneered this type of tongue-in-cheek, knowing self-referentialism.And William Holden ... handsome, sarcastic, jaded, sexy-voiced William Holden as the down-and-out writer who turns gigolo. His character is only about 30 years old, but already the Hollywood system has chewed him up and spit him out. He can't even pay his rent or his car loan. His dry, witty, noir-esquire narration of the story adds yet another layer of perfection to this 11-out-of-10 movie.What else is there to say? How does one adequately describe perfection?

294,Nothinggrandproductions,A masterpiece of a character study,10,9 September 2013,"Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career.This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.",Sunset Blvd.

Sure, any screenwriter has been drowned in the swimming pool of the villa of a star, shot to death, but the plot of the movie, it's a true story. Gloria Swanson was really an actress forgotten by cinema, Erich Von Stroheim a German director, not famous anymore and Buster Keaton and the other ""ghosts"" were really living in those conditions.

In her mind she is a true star, but Hollywood looks at her as a thing of the past. William Holden offers another great performance as the struggling screenwriter who shows up in Norma's life at the wrong time and ends up with much more than he bargained for.

Not that it didn't have its moments -- that particularly riveting scene, for instance, where Norma sits in DeMille's chair and a stagehand acquaintance puts a spotlight on her and people begin crowding around her, how spooky can you get? But by and large, Gloria Swanson hams up her lines to the point where she becomes a TV skit caricature (only this skit goes on way too long), Holden runs his lines off too fast, and von Stroheim mumbles all his lines indifferently (I picture him saying to himself, ""Here I am, the genius who directed 'Greed', and what am I doing today??""). Let's face it, folks, this is the kind of claptrap that made the revolution in film-making some 20 years later so necessary, films like ""The French Connection"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" sweeping away the cobwebs of crass melodramas like ""Sunset Boulevard"" and never looking back.

The second lost time is for us that 50s Hollywood, the violins playing behind the actors' old American accent, the complete lack of computer effects, the movies that try to catch you not with eye-filling visuals, but with moving stories, even if self-referencing to Hollywood's industry.Gloria Swanson deserves special reference. Her performance is quite amazing, with that accent that reminds me of Cruella de Vil when she says ""Anita, daaahrling..."" in 101 Dalmats. So much glamour, so delicate moves, all mixed up with terrible psychological distress, craziness, spotlights overdose.

No wonder that Paramount was kept in the dark during a large period of the production...It shatters the Hollywood myth in a totally unapologetic way. Focusing on how fame is ephemera and that, no matter how famous you are, you will soon be forgotten and replaced by others that will, sooner or later, also be forgotten.It also focuses on the refusal to accept that the past will never come back and how we can live in a complete delusion fueled by our lack of acceptance.Furthermore, Gloria Swanson's performance is superb and legendary.It's also unusual to have a story narrated by a dead man and even less in 1950...To sum up, this is definitely a timeless movie and of the must-watch classics.",Sunset Blvd.

Gloria Swanson is fantastic as an ageing silent movie star cast out by Hollywood after films turned to audio dialogue. This film is as relevant today as it was in 1950.

I remember being in Spain...But anyway, as much as I love Billy, this is a very good movie, but it's not perfect. The first 30 minutes are, that I admit, but then it slows down. I know that this is intended. The second act is all about being trapped in this bizarro world, but since you do know how it's ending and no other person appears, the end is too obvious. The only thing is to guess who will be pulling that trigger, isn't it?!Btw, I love DVD, and the audio commentary is really useful in this one. There are some hidden jokes, you will not get unless you were living during these days or you have done extend studies of the history of Hollywood, for example the dialogue with the producer.

I'm convinced that the trick to getting the most out of SUNSET BLVD, is not to let it be the first classic movie that you watch. After recently viewing the restored edition on DVD, I realized how much more I understood about this film than I did the first time I'd seen it many years ago. It wasn't because I'd seen it before. It was because I'd seen many early and silent films since. It's within the context of early cinema that SUNSET BLVD really takes on a horrific and realistic tone. Even the casting reflects this, although it's best if I don't comment on that for those who haven't viewed the movie yet. And if you haven't, by all means wait. Watch some major silent films if you can find them. Then watch some early classics from the '30s and '40s. I'm not saying you can't watch SUNSET and think it's great all by itself. But you're really missing much of the bite of the film, I believe, in not getting a bit of an early cinema education beforehand. Once you 'get it', this one really stays with you. For me, that's the best kind of film.",Sunset Blvd.
306,csdietrich,The Greatest American Film of All Time!,10,23 February 2001,"SUNSET BOULEVARD, this writer's favorite American film and an ageless, deathless and eternal classic about Hollywood and the victims of fame and unrequited love. Gloria Swanson's bravura moment, the bravest role of her career, is positively mesmerizing. The script crackles with brilliance in every line (so many unforgettable statements and remarks about the star system) that it packs a whallop as no other film can or ever has. William Holden is perfectly cast as the definitive writer-turned-gigolo (the role was originally meant for Montgomery Clift) and Erich Von Stroheim gives yet another star turn as her manservant, Max. There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to convey the power and dark poetry of this quintessential cinematic classic. Franz Waxman provides one of his greatest scores here. The injustice of the time was that ALL ABOUT EVE stole nearly every Oscar this film deserved to have, but clearly illustrates what sour grapes  Hollywood's elite felt after this movie hit the screens!",Sunset Blvd.

309,jdoan-4,Excellent satire,9,15 November 2005,"Hollywood doesn't produce many effective satires, much less an effective satire about itself. This movie is very effective. I would rank this with ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as one of the greatest satires. Wilder is able to keep a balance between absurd parody and intelligent commentary. He very evocatively portrays the corrupting influence of the Hollywood establishment.All the actors are perfectly suited for their roles. Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful. She is able to disguise her true emotion with over-exaggerated melodrama.Several times on the DVD it is noted that Wilder is not considered a great visual director. I think his visuals are above par, and very effective. The scene in which Norma and Joe are watching her silent picture is a good example. She stands up into the projector light with a Gothic, almost surreal appearance. It is as though she exists merely as a two-dimensional projection. In her mind, there is no world outside of the silver screen. The New Year's Eve party is another. There is an overhead shot of Norma and Joe dancing on the tiled floor. You see Norma and Joe all alone amongst the opulence of the house. They really only have each other. As we see, they cannot exist without each other. It is just them and no one else. This is one great movie",Sunset Blvd.
310,arighnachatterjee,Attention is poisonous,8,6 August 2020,"The film offers you two very distinctive worlds of seclusion & chaos.
A struggling film writer, Joe Gillis happens to stumble upon a faded isolated actress, Norma Desmond and begins to work for her at her place.
The character of Norma Desmond is very dominant & narcissistic thereby taking away the personal space of freedom loving Joe through emotional threats as obsession for love & spotlight engulfs her.
Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson was brilliant.
William Holden as Joe Gillis was quite charming however I feel it would have been better if the chemistry between Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson and Joe was showed a little more. The intimacy between them would've perfectly balanced the unwillingness of Joe to give in to the wishes of Norma.
The screenplay was great and flawless.
A great Noir which influences many modern films.",Sunset Blvd.
311,morticia64,They don't make them like this anymore...,10,12 November 2021,"Sunset Boulevard is an amazing film. Made post World War II, it highlights the transition of silent films to talkies and the struggle of actors to adapt. Actress Norma Desmond is a casualty of the change. Instead of embracing talking pictures, she becomes a recluse. She surrounds herself with memorabilia from her glory days as a silent film star. When a down on his luck writer shows up at her mansion, she plans her grand come back with his help.This is Gloria Swanson's finest film. She is amazing. Every film lover should see her performance. William Holden is also terrific as the writer who becomes her kept man. Erich Von Stroheim also gives a compelling performance as Norma's morose butler who protects her from the truth: that no one remembers her and she has no fans.Even though this movie was made in 1950, it will keep your attention all the way through and never lags. It's a wonderful lens into Hollywood in its glory years and how the studios churned out movies. I highly recommend it and there is nothing lacking in this film. Brilliant acting. Brilliant story. Wonderful music. It deserves a ten.",Sunset Blvd.
312,deltajvliet,Sunset Boulevard (1950),8,30 November 2009,"From Anthony Mann's T-Men to Jules Dassin's Rififi, my favorite noirs have always focused on crime. Crime and noir go hand in hand, a dark subject for a dark genre. It's not required, but the violence and deception and greed that one associates with crime is such appropriate subject matter.Sunset Boulevard is mostly devoid of it, save a murder at the end, and this left me a little disappointed. In the movie's defense, though, it's got a lot of noir's other common elements There's the 1950's California setting, the black and white visuals, a femme fatale, and a dark, sometimes eerie atmosphere.William Holden does a solid job as usual, but props especially go to Gloria Swanson for essentially playing herself—a star of Cecil B. DeMille silent era movies whose popularity waned in the 30's. It's always admirable when actors can play caricatures of themselves, especially when it's in a negative light.The movie has stayed with me in the days since watching it, a good sign that it was memorable. Still, I wonder what its point was. Joe Gillis would criticize me for wanting ""one of those message pictures,"" for not being content with a simple story, and maybe he'd be right. After all, it was at least told well.8/10",Sunset Blvd.

I watched his other movies one after the other and I was never disappointed. He really made some great movies on great themes without ever losing his focus on the entertainment value of the movie. 'Stalag 17', 'double indemnity', 'the apartment' all are such great movies. Most of the movie is narrated in first person and you see what the protagonist sees, a technique which has been used in so many movies after this. The narration is flawless and drama so intense that I watched the whole movie without batting an eyelid. The characters are real with shades of grey that you empathize and dislike at the same time. The whole thing is dark and a film noir in true sense. One of my all time favorites and I cannot over-recommend this movie to anyone.",Sunset Blvd.

But, it was the 50's.",9,25 July 2019,"Fascinating story of a once beloved actress by millions, but now narcissistically delusional and hopeless in search for her lost fame. Not exactly fame, but her position in the world. Norma, in her 50s, has all the money in the world and very little of the respect she thinks she'd still deserve, meets the financially poor and morally flexible Joe.
Wonderful work by the always humoring Billy Wilder. Always admired his storytelling. And here, he does it perfectly.
Two desperate world collide, two different types of desperation.
The cinematography is so perfect you'd feel you're in the 50's Hollywood.
The poor 51year old Norma, with the emotional stability of a 13year old child falls hardly for the 32 year cold hearted Joe. Both have difficulties facing own's reality.

Sunset Blvd was the best dark comedy meets real life picture I have ever seen bar none.  Norma Desmond aging has been actress long lost from the modern stage sits going ever so quietly insane in a huge mansion that serves as here self imposed creaking prison complex.  Surrounded by lavish furnishings in a one time architecturally masterful home that while still unique and beautiful are now aged crumbling threadbare relics of a bygone era much as is their mistress. Poor dear Norma has but one fan left an equally pathetic hanger on.  A man in name only who clings to aging film star Norma Desmond hoping his acting career gets a much needed jump start.  They both use each other much the way a Remora clings near the mouth of a shark in hopes of enjoying bits of food that steam past as the shark feeds.  Norma whose star has long ago cooled into a pile of solid iron covering an even colder neutronium core has no life giving food to share with her mercenary paramour.  So both Norma Desmond and, her toy boy do what all parasites in co-dependant relationships do eventually.... They feed off each other and, last one left standing in this case gets an imaginary close up taken by non-existent camera's as crowds of adoring fans cheer if only between Norma's ears.  Her savvy bo has taken a dip in the pool which he entered as he did the relationship with Norma eyes wide open blinded by his lust to what she was.This was an awesome story quite ahead of its time.  Brutally funny but real and eerie.  This one makes you think even when you do not want to. There is a little Norma Desmond in us all.  The want of things out of reach that lust to have just a little more time in the sun before our inevitable twilight engulfs us.  Life for Norma Desmond is a shroud that only she does not see she is wearing it.This is a must own DVD or video get the DVD when it becomes available.",Sunset Blvd.
317,jackhamel1987,"Like Icarus, Hollywood flies to close to the sun, its wings melt and it crashes",10,18 August 2011,"Sunset Boulevard represents everything that is unsaid about Hollywood. It cruelly, yet accurately represents Hollywood in the same way that Citizen Kane so cruelly and accurately represents the world of business. Sunset waste no time. It throws us straight into the middle of what appears to be a mystery, but soon becomes a tragedy, and perhaps even an allegory of Old Hollywood meeting New Hollywood and not liking it one bit, a story of unwelcome but necessary progression. We meet Joe Gillis (William Holden) within seconds of the opening credits. The twist? He's a dead. Shot and floating in a swimming pool - a pool that he has always wanted (perhaps even more than to be a writer). Joe then starts to narrate, telling us how he came to be in the pool. He was a down and out writer, living in a small flat with debts to pay. One day the debts catch up and he finds himself making a run for it. He winds up taking a wrong turn into the grounds of an old house. That house is owned by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a middle aged actress who is past her prime but refuses to accept it and move on with her life. This is where Joe's nightmare begins, as he is effectively held captive, desperate for money, by a woman who is desperate for admiration and love and who will give anything for it, and in the end do anything to prevent the illusion from collapsing on front of her. This is where we see for the first time, that Norma could represent Old Hollywood (the past), whilst Joe could represent New Hollywood (the future). Norma and Old Hollywood are stuck in their ways. They hate the idea of progression, hate new talent, hate anything that changes the status quo and could go on to destroy them. So they becomes desperate, they take more and more desperate measures, they lure Joe and us with false promises of greatness, they bribes us. They will even take cruel punishment if it means that we and Joe will still sit there and pay attention. Norma begs Joe to hit her, rather than to hate her, and will bribe him with everything - just like Hollywood will take the remarks of critics if it means that audiences will keep going back, or it will gives us the likes of Transformers 3, a Spiderman reboot or anything that can give the illusion that it still has the answers, the talent.Because nothing scares Norma more than a lack of audience, and the same can be said for Hollywood. Of course, Joe and New Hollywood, they want progression. They, like us, hate the lack of progression, hate the repetitiveness, hate the way they and we are left in the cold when we know that we can do better. Norma thinks she still has it - but Joe knows the truth. She has had her day and needs to bow out gracefully to allow progression. At the moment, Hollywood still thinks it has it. But we know the truth - cinema numbers have fallen, and Hollywood is relying too heavily on reboots, comebacks, sequels and prequels. There is nothing original. There is little to no progression. In Sunset, the desperation in Norma turns to a jealous, uncontrollable rage that results in her essentially going mad and, SPOILER, shooting Joe dead to keep him hers and maintain her illusion that she is great. Hollywood, in desperation, doesn't shoot us dead, but does bombard us with explosions, special effects, promising adverts and violence that mask the fact that most films are no longer great, but just routine and are in desperate need of new, refreshed talent. Of course, even after all the trouble Norma causes, Joe tries hard to like her, to understand her, to make excuses, to protect her from the truth. He knows that she was a star, and at first even thinks there is a chance she could be again. And again, that can be said of us with Hollywood. We love Hollywood, not because of what it is, but because of what it once was and could be again in the right hands. We don't want to let a bright start fade. We want it to be great, so we put up with Michael Bay's Transformers, with a Spiderman reboot, with a poor remake of classics, because we hope that Hollywood will get its act together and make something bigger and better. Perhaps that final shot, where Norma reaches towards the camera, is Hollywood reaching for us in desperation?I'm not sure whether Wilder wanted to make this a film about failed stardom, or a metaphor for Hollywood. But it is a true testament to he and the cast that we can take the film literally or metaphorically, and still still be touched by it. Easily one of the best films of all time, right there with The Godfather or Chinatown. 10/10",Sunset Blvd.

319,vlevensonnd-1,"Gutsy, Gritty, Dark, Entertaining",8,25 June 2011,"I've heard about this movie since before I was even a teenager, and have seen little snip-its of the film, and have always wanted to see it, but I hadn't actually seen it until tonight - at age 46.It's one of those movies that you hear so much about - you hear the praises and glorification, but when you know you'll finally be seeing it, you wonder if you're going to be disappointed, like I certainly was with 'Gone With The Wind'. The only thing I was disappointed with Sunset Boulevard, is I wish it was in full color. Other then that, THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC!!It was really a gutsy move to make this back at that time, with Hollywood trying to hang on to all the glamor and glitz (behind their mask), because I do not believe that Swanson's character, Norma Desmond, only represented one woman. I believe her character was symbolic of sooooooo many actors and actresses (but mainly actresses, because of the main value placed with actresses are youth and beauty. An aging male actor is still more marketable then a middle aged actress.) There seems to be certain professions that draw certain types of people. Acting seems to draw an ENORMOUS amount of hyper-insecure, overly dramatic, and overly sensitive people - those that just thrive on gaining attention from others. The insecurity very quickly becomes egomania, snobbishness, and false pride when they gain a bit of fame, and then they become professional victims who claim childhood abuse or other when they don't get their way, or when the public knows they've done something very wrong. To show certain aspects of this in a movie made back then is TRULY GUTSY!! KUDOS!! It made way for other like movies to come about, like, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""Play Misty For Me"", ""Fatal Attraction"" (Where the emotionally disturbed woman was played by Glenn Close, who later played Norma Desmond in the Broadway version of Sunset Blvd.), and so many others.I would highly recommend seeing this flick.

I think Gloria Swanson's performance deserves it's place on the list of all-time great ones and Erich Von Stroheim was very good as well. William Holden wasn't bad, he was quite good actually. It was his narration, however, that bothered me throughout the film.

The aged actress' character seemed very real to me, although she was eccentric and crazy. She was very sympathetic and I felt as if Joe took advantage of her. I liked the way this movie was made, the body in the pool, the darkness, the isolation of much of the movie. The inclusion of references to other film stars and film makers also brought a realistic feel to it. Their relationship somehow made me uncomfortable, I'm not sure if it was their age difference or because she was so needy and controlling of him. It did seem he had some feeling for her, because he went back after he found out that she tried to kill herself. That last scene was very powerful with the lights and the crowd, like her swansong.

323,guy_anisimov,most interesting!,10,31 January 2007,"the reason i find this picture so interesting is the very delicate issue it talks about.an aging x Hollywood star is having a very hard time dealing with the fact she's getting old and still dreams of her big comeback to pictures even though they have changed from the time she used to act.having a hard time getting old is a very common thing its just that this specific woman develops it to some kind of madness or psychotic sickness that is damaging her life more and more as time goes by.she is basically obsessed with herself which naturally is the reason she gets neglected by everyone and ends up being lonely again and again, this loneliness is eventually what will make her suicidal.the only one who is always there and never leaves her is her servant which is her first husband.my opinion on this is that they got married when she was young and healthy with no sicknesses or self obsessions. this is also the reason he stays with her all along, because he knows how she is when she is OK and he's probably waiting for the day she will return to herself.the film is very exciting and even though you know from the start what is about to happen in the end you cant know exactly how it happens.it makes you feel really good watching a movie that is almost 60 years old for the first time and still being satisfied of it i.i have never seen a story like this in film before and even if i did i don't believe it would have been the same as in sunset blvd.i cant finish without saying something about the ending, it really doesn't get better then this.perhaps one of the best endings i have ever seen on screen.",Sunset Blvd.
324,thepartyoftea,"Stereotypes, famous lines and HollyWeird!",9,6 November 2006,"Sunset Boulevard (1950) Hollywood is the land of dreams, fame, money, and broken hearts. ""Sunset Boulevard"" is an almost behind the scenes look at the industry and the type of people in it. Sunset Boulevard is a real road that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills and features real Hollywood landmarks like the movie Mulholland Drive.""Sunset Boulevard"" opens with a murder scene, murder is always a hot subject in Hollywood, especially if it was someone famous or in the industry, such as Elizabeth Short, an inspiring actress became California's most infamous murder victim in 1947 because of the mystery behind her death and that she was actress and actor River's Phoenix who died from a drug overdose on the actual Sunset Boulevard, outside of the Viper Room. The movie also features a starving struggling writer and his experience with his rotten agent and the movie producer who wants to change his script. There's also the loyal butler, the fresh newbies to the scene writer and the party guy film crew worker. All of these stereotypes work very well to help create the world of Hollywood. They were made so stereotypical to the point of parody to show how crazy it can be to live in Hollywood, or as some people call it, HollyWeird! The bizarreness doesn't stop there, pet monkeys, Directors marring the stars, becoming their butlers, and super ego complexes.At the center of the film is Norman Desmond, as played by Gloria Swanson. Gloria Swanson wasn't by far the first person considered for the film, she wasn't even the sixth. But Gloria Swanson delivers one of the most memorable roles of all time with some of the most famous lines of movie history. Norman Desmond is a former silent movie star the world has seemed to forgotten, living in a huge run down mansion with a faithful butler. With a larger then life ego and in deep denial of her stardom, Norma is a diva that demands a lot of attention and often acts like the world revolves around her. Norma is writing a script when Joe first meets her and after reading it and hearing that it was written from the heart Joe says that it's the best kind of writing, but the script is heavily flawed. Norma longs to return to the limelight, she's had a taste of it and wants it back. She's also looking for someone to love and keep her company. When Joe arrives that fateful day Norma finds a gentleman who could help her with her script, but the relationship slowly grows and changes until Joe has become Norma's show boy. Joe doesn't really like being kept, but soon learns to live with it and enjoy the loveless relationship, well loveless to him. With Joe around Norma becomes more outgoing and ventures outside of her estate and sees more old friends. Much like Norma, Joe's taste of the limelight remains and he also gets caught up back in the industry and starts to enjoy writing once again.Casting is extremely well done for ""Sunset Boulevard"", it casts a former silent movie star Gloria Swanson who fit the role perfectly, to getting cameo appearances from other silent movie era stars. The casting adds to the world of Hollywood and makes it feel real with a real director playing himself (Cecil B. DeMille) and a director(Erich von Stroheim) playing the butler.""Sunset Boulevard"" contains everything Hollywood has: romance, power, money, deceit, actors, actresses, new comers, writers, directors, murder, a come back attempt, a studio and scandal.",Sunset Blvd.
325,gingerrdriley,Snst Blvd Rvw,9,23 October 2015,"This movie is a great character study and serves as an insightful look at the aftermath of the monumental transition between silent and sound in the film-making industry. The only major hang up to be found is an issue of presentation which, to me at least, doesn't do too much to tarnish the film.The acting is great across the board, with the standout of course being Gloria Swanson. Somewhat overshadowed by her is William Holden in the lead who, despite Gloria's powerful presence, gives a very watchable and nuanced performance. His role is one which is easily related to by the viewer and acts as a perfect catalyst for the feelings of the audience. The decisions made and the actions taken by Joe seem very true to life for just about anyone and the bridge that the character creates between the absurdness of the story and the audience is invaluable. Gloria Swanson does a spectacular job acting completely insane. Hers is a performance equally as invaluable as Holden's and is equally as layered. Given that the story is centered around her it is only appropriate that Norma Desmond's character is the most fascinating and is made more engrossing as the film progresses as the unraveling story of her past adds more and more depth.The rest of the actors do very well with Erich Von Stroheim providing a performance nearly as engrossing as Gloria Swanson's. The movie is impressively shot and the story well written/acted. The only issue I found was the narration by Holden as Joe. The remarks that he makes often seem redundant and the visuals within the film are frequently sufficient in getting the message across. That is not to say that the narration is entirely damaging, as it effectively expresses thoughts which the main character often cannot voice given the context of the story.

327,mateusolivotti,A sad and true portrait of Hollywood,10,28 October 2020,"Sunset Boulevar is undoubtedly one of the greatest masterpieces of cinema and certainly one of my favorite films.The film tells the story of an unsuccessful screenwriter who has a flat tire and seeks shelter in a large mansion that appears to be abandoned, but the owner of the house was Norma Desmond, a big silent movie star who hasn't made a film in twenty years. . So she decides to hire the boy to write the script for her next film.I'm in love with this film, everything about it is incredible, soundtrack, direction, visual and obviously Gloria Swanson's brilliant performance, which I consider one of the best female performances in cinema. For me a mandatory film for everyone who says they love cinema, it is an absolute classic that deserves to be seen. He is certainly worthy of the 11 Oscar categories in which he was nominated.",Sunset Blvd.
328,mammigirl,Sunset Blvd,7,12 April 2010,I thought this movie was pretty good. I like how it shows how Hollywood can affect a person and how being in the spotlight can consume their life. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a perfect example. In this movie she is living in the past to when she was really famous. A man by the name of Joe Gillis ends up at her house and gets forced to look at her screen play. Norma seems like she has some kind of mental problem and that shes not all there. If Joe tries and goes somewhere and shes not with him she acts like she is gonna kill herself. At the end of the movie he tries and leaves but as he walks out she shoots him. It doesn't even phase her. When the cops come she thinks that they are their to shoot her movie. So we see the camera focus on her as she is coming down the stairs. She doesn't even know that they are their to take her away that's how messed up she is. She is to focused on being in the spotlight.,Sunset Blvd.
329,oconnor0930,The sun has set,6,7 April 2010,"""Sunset Blvd"" unfortunately wasn't as exciting for me as I thought it would be after hearing all the hype. Perhaps it is because the premise is either too dated or too cliché. Nowadays, sixty years after the movie was released, we all know the dark side of Hollywood. We know how it eats people up and spits them out. There is something very real about this film noir, but today it is not something new or particularly interesting. However, sixty years ago, this film was probably more intriguing and 'groundbreaking'.I am generally a fan of more character driven movies so I did enjoy that aspect of ""Sunset Blvd"". The movie is well cast and the female lead, Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, is a particularly interesting character is sad to watch because she is a fallen star who fails to grasp reality. The costumes in this movie are notable if you pay attention to them. The sets are also a strong suit.This movie accurately shows just how cruel Hollywood can be. However, this is no revelation to people who watch it for the first time nowadays. You will either greatly applaud it or it will be unappreciated.",Sunset Blvd.
330,De_Sam,That was last year. This year I'm trying to earn a living.,9,22 October 2015,"I have always had a soft spot for films about filming, and another for Hollywood satires, so is it any wonder I thoroughly enjoyed Sunset Blvd.?Other than the personally-compelling story, there were some great shots in the film, most notably the shot of the body from inside the pool (in 'Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back you can learn that is was shot with a mirror while keeping the temperature of the water at 40° to keep the distortion to a minimum). The sets are great and really shine in the deep-focus cinematography that reminded me of Citizen Kane.Gloria Swanson plays her role with authenticity, it was a version of herself she played, as her last great role stemmed from the thirties. The fragment shown in the film is Queen Kelly, directed by Erich Von Stroheim, another actor whose role was close to reality. Above all Wilder showed a cynicism far ahead of its time, sure it was already present in films such as The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra in the late twenties, but such films were not made by the great directors of Hollywood itself. This sharp depiction of the darker sides of Hollywood, i.e. the corruption, the exploitation of people, the Machiavellian attitude towards personal gain, is a big part why this film did not win the Oscar for best film in 1950. The reasons why the academy disliked it are the same reasons why I love it.I can finally see why David Lynch referenced this film in the beginning of Mulholland Dr..",Sunset Blvd.

332,pain93,"A haunting, eerie and amazingly true look at Hollywood! One of the best films ever made",10,17 June 2008,"Perhaps the best film ever made, 'Sunset Blvd' follows the story of lonely and struggling writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is thrown into a web of romance and feuds with aging silent actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her creepy butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) when he accidentally stumbles across Norma's mansion when he uses her garage for his car so it doesn't get taken. Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood. But Joe knows all to better and wants to escape her odd, aging and treacherous ways. He meets Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) and begins writing a script with her-and perhaps even falling in love. This sets off Norma who will stop at nothing to be in the limelight, get Joe and make pictures again...even if it means murder. An intelligent look at Hollywood with amazing performances and one of the best scripts. The use of the black and white color makes a grim and eerie look of the film, which helps pull the viewer in. A fascinating thing about the film is that while the story is fictional it somewhat holds true to Gloria Swanson, even at one point viewing a film of hers that ruined her career! A truly haunting and memorable look at the desperate and true side of Hollywood. 10/10",Sunset Blvd.
333,eebyo,Gloria Swanson is braver than you . . .,10,29 January 2006,". . . and, no question, braver than I'll ever be. Now that 75 is the new 50, it's hard for us to imagine the sheer moxie -- and the steep risk of career-poisoning mockery -- put into play in 1949 when a 50-year-old actress long past her glamor-drenched prime became Norma Desmond, the only living soul who doesn't know her day is done and her sex appeal is long gone. I can't think of a precedent for a woman taking on such a perilous role in a serious movie, and I doubt that any of today's maturing -- OK, aging -- woman stars would do it on a dare, let alone agree to play side-by-side with film clips from their glory days. There are a few better films and a handful of better performances, but nobody ever undressed her own persona on screen with more daring and to better effect than Miss Swanson. Ten stars and a medal of valor.",Sunset Blvd.
334,Sweets742,color,7,11 May 2010,"I very much enjoyed watching Sunset Blvd. I really liked the director Wilder a lot. I loved the plot I thought it was a different mix up from the typical romance films. I liked how it was about a faded movie star. It was something different that you didn't see a lot in the early 1950s, rather then all the glam. I have to say that I did like the soundtrack, it was a mix up which I really don't usually like. The camera work was great and the sounds. It brought out the city in a great way, you thought you were there during the whole film. The only thing I didn't like was that it was in black and white. I thought that it could have been a lot better in color.",Sunset Blvd.

As far as the way films were made during this time period, wilder is unmatched and a true genius. While a dark movie, the performances are stellar and the story sucks you in from the beginning. The narration of Billy Wilder movies makes it impossible for you to take your eyes off the screen.",Sunset Blvd.
336,stasia_stasia,Crazed for the Limelight!,9,29 March 2010,"This movie was everything excellent. Both William Holden and Gloria Swanson played strong parts in this film, giving the appearance of realism. The narration in the beginning of the film and throughout helped give a very good feeling to the film, almost as if you were part of it, or reading about it in those newspapers in the film. The filming and story line and a nice flow to it, making it smoothly drift along Joe Gillis's story of his life and the troubles he is going through on the last days of his life. Gloria Swanson almost didn't agree to acting in the film, but personally I am glad she didn't since no one else would probably have been able to play the part of Norma Desmond, the used to be star. There were some over dramatized parts that were played by Gloria Swanson but that only showed us her craziness. All in all I did end up loving this film, it was both dark and romantic. A great 1950's black and white film.",Sunset Blvd.
337,bruscinoa833,Sunset Boulevard,7,10 May 2010,"This film was suspenseful but at times did seem to drag on. At the start of the film the viewer is introduced to the main character and the narrator of the film, floating dead in a pool. Right off the bat the audience is waiting for his demise during the whole film. Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is one of those characters that the audience is just waiting to break. The entire film she seems to be on the brink of a meltdown and her obsession with reviving her movie career and her romance with Joe always seem to be pushing her closer and closer to the edge. In a way I found myself loving and hating Joe, at one second I would rooting for him to escape and be with Betty but at the same time he was stringing Norma along. The use of dark and light in the film give a real feel of what life was like for everyone inside Norma's estate. Most of the scenes inside her home are quite dark and gloomy while any of the scenes in which Joe escapes are bright and jovial. This reflects Hitchcocks use of dark and light in his film Notrious. Although the audience knows the whole time that Joe is going to be murdered and the film does not let you forget it, it really draws you in with the acting and camera-work.",Sunset Blvd.
338,j-schardt,Creepy,7,31 March 2010,"Sunset Blvd. is a excellent murder mystery thats leaves you guessing until the end. There is a great shot right in the beginning where the camera is underwater looking up at the dead body directly above face down in the water and the detectives looking down upon him. This scene is actually the end of the movie. Then the movie starts from the beginning and shows you how the body got there. The film starts off fast with a great car chasing scene. There great sound effects off tire's screeching around turns and eventually one of the tires even pops. The main character Joe soon arrives at a mysterious,creepy,and what seems to be abandon Maison. This mansion gives the perfect creepy vibe to the movie. Right away there's a very scary shot of Norma looking down at him through an upstairs window, a very classic shot to warn the audience something just not right with the house. The inside of the house is even creepier with tons of weird directions and organ music playing in the background. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Norma is standing in front of the projector light and it looks as though smoke is coming off her head really signaling to the audience of her evil mysterious ways.Norma's character overall is great she did a very wonderful Job of play the crazy old actress from Hollywood with priceless facial expressions. I think without her strong acting it definitely would not have been such a good film. I didn't enjoy how Joe and the younger Women fell for each other so fast and didn't really understand the scene where they looked like they were going to make out in the bathroom of her boyfriends party. It was very awkward and strange, as well as the rest of the film but I just didn't think it made sense to put in. Overall its a good film and would recommend it.",Sunset Blvd.
339,tamarenne,"Wonderful, if a bit overrated.",7,9 August 2009,"This IS a great film. But it is, unfortunately, over-rated.I find it fascinating, but the writing does not hold a candle to it's contemporary, All About Eve, nor does the acting. Swanson delivers a very good performance, but it lacks the complete mastery of her craft that Bette Davis delivered as Margo Channing in a much more moving and self-aware performance. Swanson was a great star but she always delivered her lines over the top and frankly I don't think she could have delivered her lines in this movie any other way. She was limited.The direction is excellent and in cinematography alone can this film be said to be superior to All About Eve.I never found William Holden particularly interesting as an actor but he does a credible job here. I find it odd that this movie is so adored but that I guess is all personal taste. I wouldn't put it in my top ten, although it's in my top 100 for sure.",Sunset Blvd.
340,s-diblasicrain,HIST American Cinema,6,15 December 2009,"I was left with an extremely odd feeling after I watched this film. It left me with this ambiguous and bittersweet feeling and it actually took me quite some time, in which I had to roll it around a bit in my head, before I could figure out whether I enjoyed or detested the movie.The character of Norma Desmond certainly drove me up the wall. I pitied her but at the same time felt an odd disgust. However the huge old mansion that she resided in was spectacular, glamorously decorated and covered with nostalgic photographs of her back in her glory days when she was a silent film star. I think that this more interesting extension of Norma Desmond and her world maybe made her a bit more tolerable.",Sunset Blvd.
341,sarathda,Billy Wilder masterpiece,9,5 August 2020,"There is a lot to love about this movie, which is loaded with great performances, and intersects film noir with fading Hollywood stardom. It grabs us from the start with police called to the scene of a mansion with a body floating in its pool, and as we listen to a deadpan narrator. Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body. The film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money. He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson). The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it. While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies. Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment. Gloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes. The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites. Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none. The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special. Wilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is. It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic. We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there. It's a very touching moment. Things get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fiancé (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet). Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming. The film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence. Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on. With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",Sunset Blvd.
342,alooftrashman,All She Wanted Was The Spotlight,10,17 March 2010,"Normally, I save these reviews to examine the technical aspects of what goes into a film. However, when a film like Sunset Boulevard plays across my screen, I feel compelled to go into a deep analysis about the story, especially one as self-aware as this.A screenwriter Joseph Gillis (William Holden) escaping from creditors gets a flat tire and parks his car in a seemingly abandoned extravagant mansion. He enters, to find the house very much inhabited by a faded silent film actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her butler, Max (Erich Von Manstein). This is what sets up the rest of the plot, and it's my personal belief that this entire movie was an allegory for the decline of the movie industry in the 1950s.Gloria Swanson, for one, is best known for her silent films - and she essentially plays a hammed-up crazy version of herself in this film, wanting to relive the vanity and glamor she once had on the silver screen. If she represents the old, Holden's Gillis represents the new - a writer trying to make it using hollow plot techniques (a baseball movie called Bases Loaded? Come on...) There are several industry in-jokes that make this movie a joy, including (but not limited to:) A screenplay that started about the dust bowl being filmed entirely in a torpedo boat, extras only being limited to three drinks of punch per, and the realization that actors make terrible writers.As stated before, though, it's the allegorical content that really makes this movie watchable again and again and again. If Gillis represents the new studio movement and Desmond represents ye olde guard, the story takes on a completely new light. New studios are hamstrung by the old crowd and the old standards (Hays codes, etc.), and they pass up opportunities on new properties and new developments (represented by Nancy Olsen's character Betty Schaefer), standing by fading stars holding onto their last glimpses of vanity, until they are literally bled dry and dying; as seen by Gillis' death. A fantastic movie, and I didn't even get to mention the cameo by Buster Keaton, silent film legend who unsurprisingly has one line of dialog.",Sunset Blvd.
343,b-mooney,The twilight zone,8,25 November 2009,I give this film a lot of credit for its creativity with respect to the storyline. I felt like it was an episode from the twilight zone because Gloria Swanson was so detached from reality. I liked the narration being from the point of view of the murdered man in flashback style. I thought this was unique. A lot of the story took place in the mansion of Gloria and I thought that the design did a good job of portraying her insanity. She had tons of pictures of herself and it was a good portrayal of her self-absorbed personality with respect to her former acting career. I liked the idea that there were a lot of characters in the film that were played by actual people who worked during the silent film era. It really contributed to the verisimilitude of the film. The last scene was classic and I will never forget it. The only way they could safely get her out of the house was by creating the image that she was acting in a film. Brilliant.,Sunset Blvd.
344,bellsa037,Crazy Woman !,8,26 March 2010,"The main actor voice is narrator to tell story about him, so the movie focuses on the story of the main actor. Besides, his voice sometimes describes what he is thinking. It makes the audience more understand the feeling of the character and makes the movie run more smoothly. Moreover, the background musics are very suitable with the scenes and the feeling; for example, the scene that the main actor came back from the party and went to see the main actress; the background music performed and stopped few seconds after the main actor said happy new year. In addition, the scene that the main actress did a joke to be ""Charly"" is very enjoyable with performing the background music. Finally, it is very weird to have the main actor voice after he died, and definitely the last scene that the main actress walked down from the stair like princess is very interesting the end scene that I have watched movie.",Sunset Blvd.

The seamy and unclean underside of ""Hollywood"" is given flesh and blood by both William Holden in his calculating manipulation and Gloria Swanson by her cold, grasping desperation.  The technique of telling the story from the viewpoint of William Holden's character, who has already paid the price of his cynicism and greed, was so effective as to be priceless.  What was best, for me however, was the sympathy that both the lead characters managed to evoke in spite of their obvious and outrageous flaws.  What could be more realistic, pitiful, but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer?  The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white, I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying.

The narration helped make the film feel like a crime movie by it's spoken visualizing details and mood the main actor was portraying throughout the film. At times, the narration make the viewers feel like they're in the Twlight Zone. The cinematography throughout the film was good. The slow montage that was used to show the title of the film was suspenseful and dramatic with the musical composition. There are many uses of scenes fading in and out of the bedroom scene as the screenwriter is alone writing the actress' screenplay. The closeups of the screenwriter looking into the bedroom and of the screenwriter talking to another man were well focused in mid-tone greys and well situated in their sense of depth. The use of artificial shone on the actors and their reflections on the wall were well shown in their dark contrast. The acting in this film was played out well.Although at times, the long takes dragged on the plot for a period of time, the movie kept up its suspense and drama through its great acting, lighting, mood, narration, and musical score that made the movie good.

The beginning that showed the events leading to Joe's residence at the Desmond estate was painfully slow, and instead of rising, my interest remained flat. After gradually developing Norma's character, the plot took off and my enthusiasm for the film rose exponentially. The ending was absolutely brilliant; setting Norma up to have her believe that she was being filmed for the picture that she wrote and had been preparing for. if Norma's character had not been so mentally unstable, i don't believe this film would have succeeded as well as it did.",Sunset Blvd.
349,B-Seide24,a very strange film noir film,7,4 May 2010,"I Thought that overall sunset blvd was a good movie. I did find it very hard to deal with Gloria Swanson even though she played a magnificent role and casting her was perfect for the role she had. You could tell she was a silence film actress because you could see how she used expressions and looks to portray just how she was feeling or dealing with things. This is what made it very hard for me to deal with this women. I felt the director did appropriate job of selecting a cast that met the demands of the movie including Nancy Olsen who plays the woman who gets William Holdens mojo for writing back. The score and dark ominous lighting did a amazing job of portraying just how dark a road William holden's character was moving down the line and just how far and extreme it might get to escape it. This is why the beginning scene which happens to be the last scene sets off a great example of what can happen in life if you just accept things and let people start to run your life. Wiliam Holden knew there was no escaping the dark, scary tones of what Gloria Swanson's life had become because without her he truly had nothing. Overall, this movie was brilliant and strange while keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen to ""Joe Gillis"" next.",Sunset Blvd.

The character of Norma shows perfectly the corruption and egotistical attitude an actor can portray if they allow themselves too, and is the first film I have seen that has done it so well.Unlike many of the traditional cookie cutter films at the time, this film decided to be different in its perspective, looking behind the scenes of the productions and people behind them at the time.The only thing I found wrong with this film was the pacing, the beginning of the film was quite slow and sort of felt like it was beginning to become repetitive.

The lighting, the camera angles, the sets, the screenplay all add to the noir atmosphere but it is all topped by wonderful Direction which is really flawless.Also, realistic acting performances by both William Holden and Gloria Swanson are 10/10.You can't really chose which one has done his/her part better.I never put spoilers in my reviews so I would highly recommend to watch this movie.Even if you are a Noir fan,you will love it.If you want to start watching this genre,start with the best,the crown jewel of film noir and that's undoubtedly 'Sunset Blvd' .",Sunset Blvd.

The movie started out with great imaging in the first first few scenes of seeing Joe dead with his eyes wide open basically looking at you in the pool. I noticed this whole movie was based around that one big pool. Then, once the image is set in our mind, the story and plot comes in, and time is reversed back to where it all began. This was the first film that I have seen where the Mis-en-scene was really breath taking. It was the first film where a movie used real names in Hollywood at the time. Wilder showed that the set was at Paramount Pictures. Wilder showed how movies were started and made. Also, this was the first movie of that time where i noticed other references to movies in the film. First film I have seen relevant to todays time period. Great lighting throughout the film. The settings looked expensive. Yet again, I have seen this house before in other films. They use the same houses to film quite often. Gloria Swanson was a great, intense actress. I really felt her character during the whole movie. I loved how she went insane at the end over her fame and not being what she once was. She really pulled this character off and made it believable.

355,james-m-donohue,A good homage to every important film genre before 1950.,8,18 November 2009,"Story wise, it's good. It starts off with a film noir style introduction that feels slightly forced, but the movie has a self-awareness about it that doesn't try to make fun of movies as much as it pokes fun at how silent films had become extinct and how movie making had changed. The movie quickly switches genres like Zombieland. One scene is straight out of film noir; another scene is out of a screwball comedy. It is easy to see how the movie comes together after seeing the first scene, but it gets increasingly interesting and unpredictable until the final moment when you really can see how everything happens. The final scene feels like a glorious send off with lighting present everywhere showing how much technology is necessary for a glossy scene of glamor. Parts of the movie felt like watching someone else in the movie watching a movie. Also I was eating a blueberry muffin while watching it and that made it better for me.The movie was very well cast. All parts were played very well. It was almost creepy because Gloria Swanson's character almost felt like the real her if she were instead insane and experiencing delusions of grandeur. Cameos by famous actors and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves made it feel even more surreal like it was a documentary, but it was far from it.Lighting and sound was good. It matched the scenes very well. I wish I could talk more about it, but I think I have went over this movie enough and there wasn't much I can remember that was revolutionary for the time.",Sunset Blvd.
356,anthonyehler,A new appreciation of a classic,10,19 February 2014,"Sunset Boulevard 10/10When I couldn't sleep the other night, I watched the Special Collector's Edition of Sunset Boulevard. I saw this movie years ago. After seeing the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical in Johannesburg recently, I fell in love with it all over again. I know there's nothing new to say about Billy Wilder's classic – its camp sharpness, its haunting Gothic melancholy, its rich, dark comedy, its insidiously fascinating characters – so I won't try. What struck me was recognising Wilder as a genius director. Often seen as a writer who favoured the screenplay more than visual elements, in this movie he really showed some innovative insight into framing his masterpiece. Two, in particular, stand out – the fish eye view of the body in the swimming pool and use of powder on the edges of the camera lenses. I also enjoyed the commentary into the music of the film. When I watched the film again, I had a new appreciation for Franz Waxman's score.",Sunset Blvd.

359,SpaceComics,Classic character drama.,9,24 September 2005,"Sunset Boulevard is a real classic I first learned about from parodies on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s. I didn't see the film until some 20 years later, when I found it fascinating. William Holden (Rachel And The Sranger, The Earthling) plays Joe Gillis, a bankrupt B-movie writer who drives his car into the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard to dodge the repo men. But the dilapidated place is occupied by two fascinating but weird characters, former silent screen star Norma Desmond (Goria Swanson) and her butler, balding, German-accented Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions. The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems. The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves. Carol Burnett made great fun of the role with Harvey Korman in the Max role 2 decades later, but the movie (directed and co-written by Billy Wilder) remains a grand drama, character study, and serious comment on the Hollywood star system.",Sunset Blvd.
360,robertrutledge,A Tale as Relevant Today as it was Then,8,5 January 2021,"Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard tells the story of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a young emerging screenwriter from Ohio struggling to build a career and make ends meet in Hollywood. After evading loan sharks in a high-speed car chase, he blows a tire and peels out into a seemingly abandoned mansion located on the titular street. It turns out to be the residence of silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who has long ago been chewed up and spit out by the movie-making machine that is Hollywood. She tells him that she had been expecting him when in all reality she was expecting a man bringing a coffin for her recently deceased pet monkey. Little does Gillis know that he was soon to become its replacement. Desmond ensnares Gillis with hopes of relaunching her movie career in the era of ""talkies"" (movies with audio), convincing him to move into the mansion to live with her and her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim).It is no question that Swanson is the star of this film. Her character is utterly believable: a self-infatuated actress ""past her prime"" as they say, who lives in a constant state of nostalgia. She has all the money anyone could ask for but is stuck in the past, holding on to a dream that has come and gone long ago. Indeed, when this movie came out in 1950, ""talkies"" had been around for quite some time, with Singin' in the Rain starring Al Jolson being the first mainstream movie to feature sound, released back in 1927. It is interesting to observe Desmond's negative attitude toward the evolution of the technology used in Hollywood. The character presents an interesting psychological case: if she were to have it her way, silent movies would have never gone the way of the dodo, which would have been simply unrealistic. It is also interesting to watch her obsession with her appearance devour her: a problem that actresses in Hollywood have to this day.This movie is easy to follow, yet thought-provoking. There are not too many characters to keep track of, and the plot develops at a nice, steady pace. The sticky situation in which our protagonist finds himself may not be relatable but it is understandable. He's basically the woman's sugar baby, in modern terms. The dynamic that grows (or rather, deteriorates) between the two is what makes this movie so captivating. The setting is novel yet believable, and the acting is superb. I really have no complaints.I decided to watch this movie upon the referral of one of my college professors, and I am glad I did! It is definitely worth the 110 minutes of your time, and it was easily among the best movies I saw last year. It is an interesting reflection upon the role that technology plays in society and how the people who are unable to adapt get left behind. It is also a story about heartbreak, be it because of not being loved by someone you want to be loved by, or by having your dreams shattered. These themes are relevant to this day, and in fact, it's hard to believe this movie came out seventy years ago. If you are considering watching this movie, go for it! You will not regret it.",Sunset Blvd.

Norma Desmond's silent film acting was long gone and she was well into her 50's but in her mind she was still a star.Joe Gillis played by William Holden stumbles upon Desmond's (played by Gloria Swanson) eerie mansion and immediately thinks it's been deserted. Little does he know has-been Norma is slowly slipping away into the isolation of insanity. Her mansion is more lair-like than anything with a frightening pipe organ that makes her haunted house even more disturbing. The lair is filled with photographs of the young and famous Norma that decay along with her.""No one leaves a star!"" Norma says over and over again right before she shoots Joe and he tumbles into the pool he always wanted. This scene was so haunting and terrifying, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

This is a great noir film, brilliantly lit and acted. The premise is simple: A Hollywood screenwriter chances upon an aging actress who orders him to rework a screenplay. He is relocated to her mansion- which is as much as a character as she is, and soon he realizes that not only is he trapped, but that the mysterious aging actress is a loose nut. Billy Wilder's film was a massive success upon release and its reputation has only grown since. William Holden is well cast as the tragic young scriptwriter and Gloria Swanson is magical as the elusive silent screen siren. This is dark comedy of the highest order.",Sunset Blvd.

I had seen parodies of the characters and was familiar with the story line, but I was really not prepared for this gem. Wow! When it comes to great acting, it just does not get any better. I really couldn't care less about the film's commentary on Hollywood; I watch this film to be mesmerized by Gloria Swanson. The premise of a kept man is creepy enough, but Swanson really takes this movie to another plane. If you have never seen this classic, do yourself a big favor and rent it. You will enjoy every minute. Very few movies can be called perfect, and this one may not be, but it is awfully close.",Sunset Blvd.

Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holiday but it was a tough year. Bette Davis was up for All About Eve as well. They all deserved it. William Holden found his way into two of those movies but his role of Joe Gilles was far superior to what he did in Born Yesterday that year.

Bill Holden is great as well as the reluctant sugar baby who recognizes the dysfunctional situation he turned his car into and exploits it for a time and then dies for his trouble , but what a story in between all that !!!

A writer floats dead in a swimming poll, he stares straight at us, perhaps accusingly. The narator begins to tell us the story, and what a story.Wilder would always be on the outside as far as mainstream Hollywood was concerned, and here you can see why. Sunset Boulevard is merciless in it's dissection of the film capital. By turns acerbic, nostalgic, vicious and hauntingly tragic, Sunset Boulevard is a ghost story. It features some of the greats from the movie capitals early years, now dusty and forgotten like Norma Desmond's mansion; the card game is like watching a seance.Gloria Swanson was, as the cliche has it, born to play Norma Desmond. Aided by William Holden and Victor Von Stroheim with cameos from some other silent era greats, she towers above the film. When she says: ""I'm still big, it's the films that got small."" she is speaking the literal truth.Wilder led the way for other Hollywood talents to dissect the Dream Factory. None did so as bitingly or with such obvious love for his subject. For although he may be scathing about the system, he treats his characters lovingly. Ultimately they are tragic men and women who bought into the dream and discovered, too late, how superficial it is.The final ""Ready for my close up, Mr DeMille"" scene is painful, capturing acturately the beauty, sadness, tragedy and pointlessness of Hollywood's dream.",Sunset Blvd.

If you hate everything Billy Wilder ever did, you have no soul, heart, or brain-- you're just a retarded stick with opposable thumbs. In other words, I hate you if you hate Billy Wilder.Wilder was and always will be one of the greatest writer-directors that Hollywood has ever known. Some of you are forgetting the purpose of film-- to take you away to a world that you didn't know and entertain you. That's what Billy did, only he made it funny, satirical, or both. Sunset Boulevard did get dull at points, but that's life. If you don't want movies to be somewhat real, go delude yourself and watch Teletubbies. Personally, I wish that someone would bring Billy back from the dead to make another movie and make all of the people who probably enjoyed Disaster Movie appreciate his brilliance.So God, please send your son down here so that he can do that Lazarus thing and bring back Billy. We need him down here. With a new generation of Hannah Montana's that will marry Jonas Brother look-a-likes, I need Sunset Boulevard. Because it reminds me that Hollywood isn't perfect.

Parallels exist throughout, including the enchantment.Consider:1) A man compelled to stop for the night, as did Joe Gillis, whose face showed his puzzlement and hesitation upon viewing Norma Desmond's estate on Sunset Blvd: ""This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.""2) ""Then she lit up a candle..."" Norma lit many.3) ""Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,"" as was Norma's, and, ""she got the Mercedes-Benz."" Only in Norma's case, the Isotta-Fraschini.4) ""She's got lots of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends."" Norma had gone through three husbands and lured Joe into an intimate friendship.5) ""How they danced in the courtyard..."" Joe and Norma danced in the great room.6) ""Some danced to remember"" (as did Norma); ""some danced to forget"" (as did Joe).7) ""So I called up the captain, 'Please bring me my wine.'"" Max Von Mayerling served as butler/wine captain.8) ""Pink champagne on ice."" Lots of champagne consumed in the film.9) ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device."" That's the theme of the movie! Every character is trapped in his and her own way.10) ""Last thing I remember, I was running for the door."" Joe did also to ""find the passage back to place I (he) was before.""11) Finally, ""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.""

All the people associated with the entertainment industry are guilty of this thing at some or the other point in their life. The performances of most of the actors in this movie are quite convincing. It has got an authentic feel that certainly adds to the appeal of the movie.

It was a real slap in the face for the many that think of Hollywood as glamorous and ideal. These days it's not that hard to believe that Hollywood is so scandalous because their ""dirty laundry"" is made public all the time in tabloids and such.

It more so explains why it's a mystery and that is why I enjoyed it. Full of mystery and some would say a love triangle. It's so devious as well. I could see why this movie was so well enjoyed when it was released. There are so many surprises and quirks in this movie that make it wonderful.

It had been many years since I had first watched it, and now seeing it, it was so much more of an important film to me. There are several little tricks that work on such a great level in this film that the next time I watch it I will be excited about this wonderful film. Joe's narration, opening the film with the end of the film, the set design of Norma's house, the superb cinematography and most of all Gloria Swanson. This is the only film I have ever seen of hers and she is so amazing. The character of Norma Desmond is one of a somewhat forgotten actress of the silent era who believes it is time for her great comeback to the silver screen. There is one problem though, she is a loon. Outright over the top whack job who obsesses on her career. Swamson is over the top. Very believable at times and as well, very laughable. There is a movie out there called The Forbidden Zone from early 1980's. The actress Susan Tyrell portrays a character very similar to the Desmond role, even in her facial expressions. I recommend this film to all who enjoy a good drama/thriller. I have a feeling that this film will never get old.",Sunset Blvd.
378,TheBigSnack,Even GreatNess,10,6 November 2016,"Sunset Boulevard is an original and entertaining story, a film noir based on some proximate parallels in the subculture of Hollywood celebrity.The actual story involves an aspiring writer on the lamb who without prior notice drops in on an aging leading actress of some renown.Her name is Norma Desmond and she is cared for by her butler who is also her ex-husband and former director Max (von Stroheim). He is her big believer and he is cognizant that his place is by her side within the archaic LA mansion.Norma proves to be a meticulous and neurotic handful as she attempts to resurrect her life of royal splendour using the much younger Joe Gillis as her new love, or future husband.Joe gets cold feet and arranges for secret nights out away with friends.Norma becomes suicidal with envy and deteriorates into a shivering bowl of jelly.In Sunset Boulevard, Norma Desmond at last judges Joe Gillis when she pulls a loaded handgun against his fleeting escape.

Towering performances by Gloria Swanson, William Holden and Erich von Stroheim along with a perfect music score by Franz Waxman and a witty, biting script by Billy Wilder. Swanson's performance may be the single best performance by an actress in any American film--bar none. It certainly ranks with the best work of Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep.

They had a fake background while driving the cars that was really unrealistic. Loved the staircase design in the womens house but the pictures of herself were a bit much and it almost always seemed dark in the house maybe because of her attitude she seemed to be a dark sad woman. music went with everything especially when it was dramatic like when the man finally got mad at the end.

381,pinkpanther1164,Sunset Boulevard,7,8 May 2010,"Sunset Boulevard from 1950 is a magnificently twisted Film Noir. Norma Desmond was a once extremely famous Hollywood Actress. Everyone knew who she was, loved her films and her mind absolutely adored her. What Norma doesn't realize is that she has been out of the spotlight for a longtime. She has been hiding away in her once gorgeous home, holding on to what she once was. Her house is very reflective of what she herself had become over the years. The house hadn't received much attention and in turn has become dull and un-groomed; Norma Desmond did the same. Joe Gillis is a screenwriter that has also been struggling with his career. He manages to fall in to Norma's world, and in the end shatters it. Joe agrees to help Norma with her comeback film, but in the process realizes that nobody is waiting to see it. Norma's mental state isn't always logical, but her character makes you feel for her. She was once this beautiful actress that was on top of the film world; now she's lucky if she is a distant memory. This is a dark film that shows what fame can do to a person. Norma seems as though she is stuck in the spotlight and doesn't know how to live life otherwise. The script was great, but Gloria Swanson was perfect at pulling everything together.",Sunset Blvd.
382,Katherina_Minola,Superb and disturbing,10,4 December 2013,"You know when occasionally you watch a film, and you think it sounds okay, but then it totally exceeds your expectations and you're just blown away by it? Well, Sunset Boulevard (aka Sunset Blvd.) was just such a film for me.William Holden – who also narrates the film – plays Joe Gillis, a small-time screen writer, down on both money and luck; as we find out right at the beginning of the film, Gillis won't be alive by the end of it. He meets former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot and will not accept the truth that her star has long since faded into obscurity and she has been all but forgotten by both the film industry, and movie-goers. Determined to have another hit film, she hires Joe to help her edit her self-penned script, but she soon becomes obsessed with him, and Joe finds himself less a guest, more a prisoner, at her dilapidated home, with only Norma and her mysterious butler Max for company.As you may have guessed, I loved this film. The storyline is a caustic and witty dig at a fickle Hollywood. The fact that viewers are informed by Joe's voice-over right at the start of the film, that he will not survive to the end, fills the ensuing scenes with a bitter sense of doom, and the contrast between Joe the narrator, who knows his fate, and Joe the character who we see on camera, who is unaware of what will befall him, is very effective (A similar idea was used years later in American Beauty, also with excellent results, although Sunset Boulevard was, for me, a much better film.)Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond, and at times was difficult to watch. I disliked her character, but couldn't help feeling great sympathy for her. Deserted by her fans and her colleagues, she is losing her grip on reality. At times, she was manic and unpredictable; at other times, she showed tenderness and extreme vulnerability (the scene where she entertains Joe by dressing up as Charlie Chaplin is both sweet and disturbing, as her happy mood turns to anger). Swanson was nominated for an Oscar for her performance; the same year Bette Davis was nominated for her role in All About Eve – both lost out to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday, which also starred William Holden. He was also nominated for Sunset Boulevard.William Holden shows his real talent for acting here. A not altogether likable character at the beginning of the film, he nevertheless gets the audience on side, as he and they come to realise the untenable situation in which he has found himself. He imbues his character with passion, tenderness, ruthlessness, and resignation – oh, and he's darkly funny too.Eric von Stroheim is perfectly cast as Norma's taciturn and mysterious butler – this role could easily have been a caricature in different hands, but he plays the part brilliantly.The main cast is rounded out by Nancy Olsen as Betty Schaefer, a young writer who wants Joe's help on a script; she is perfectly cast as a feisty but tender young woman who is dragged into Joe's nightmare world.In short, my opinion for what it's worth, is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's gripping – I felt unable to turn my eyes away from the screen; it's sad, it's tragic, and it's bleakly funny. It was a real victory for director Billy Wilder, and it's the best film I've seen in a long time. Very highly recommended.",Sunset Blvd.
383,Leray97,The quintessential Hollywood film,9,29 June 2018,"It's usually refreshing to watch a film that, even with the sheer amount of praise and recognition it gets, still delivers on all fronts. Sunset Boulevard is one of these movies; it has a great balance of not only being significant with its commentary on old Hollywood, but also being entertaining. There are many parts to this movie that contributes to its joy factor, my favorites are how dark this film turns out to be along with its character performances.Many classic films that I know of have a predisposition to be slightly comical and lighthearted, primarily because of the ""overacting"" and probably just due to how people looked at film back in the day. Sunset Boulevard is dark; drama is not merely a tool for storytelling or showcasing of talent and personal relationships are not touched on the same way modern drama films usually do so. The character archetypes are developed throughout the film are done in away that makes all the mystery and suspense so easy to become invested in. This is where my other favorite part of the film comes in: the actors/characters.Dramatic acting in old films is always so fun to watch. It's a craft that seems to have influenced a large part of acting seen in modern films but also can't be replicated due to their novelty. In Sunset Boulevard, the talent frontline consists of actors William Holden and Gloria Swanson. It's so easy to become enraptured by the performances these two give; Swanson's dramatic overacting is so entertainingly outlandish but also gathers meaning over time and Holden really knows how to portray emotions without verbalizing them while also giving some great little monologues here and there.Sunset Boulevard has been called ""a movie about movies"" with its commentary on the perceptions and misconceptions of Hollywood back then. Billy Wilder, the director of this film, came under a bit of fire for going this direction with this story. I think I can relate to most fans when I say that his efforts in portraying Hollywood and the film industry as a whole in such a different light has gained my utmost respect and gratitude, as I also found this film to be a very enjoyable experience.",Sunset Blvd.
384,RandyRodman,Sunset Blvd. II: Norma Lives!,9,1 February 2002,"As a rule, I'm against gratuitous remakes of film classics, but the cynical yet poignant story told in Sunset Blvd. is so timeless that it could easily be redone every ten years or so, like A Christmas Carol, with each version chronicling the slow decent into madness of a different fading movie star and his show business contemporaries due to their abandonment by Hollywood. For example, Sunset Blvd. 2002 could star Jack Nicholson as Norman Desmond and Roman Polanski as Max. They spend their evenings screening Chinatown again and again while complaining bitterly about the ""weasles at Paramount"" who won't return their calls. Jack sits stooped over his typewriter for days on end, adding yet another scene to his mammoth comeback screenplay, 'Five More Easy Pieces', while Roman pens phony fan letters for his deluded boss, scented with Chanel #5. Jack works tirelessly each day except Wednesday, when Warren Beatty, Peter Fonda and Karen Black come over and, between bong hits and hands of canasta, swap bittersweet stories of the good old days of Hollywood, before ""the suits"" took over. Jack's downfall is completed when naive young screenwriter Heather Graham rejects his leering attempts at seduction and is found face down in Jack's swimming pool, bludgeoned to death with his best putter.Next week: Nick Nolte and Walter Hill guzzle lukewarm Old Milwaukee and throw darts at a poster of Eddie Murphy.",Sunset Blvd.
385,RockySchlockyRobot,A simple story about a pool guy.,10,11 December 2006,"Quite simply, one of the sharpest screenplays ever written and luckily it has performances to match.ASome people have points they argue about this movie. Why did Joe stick around for so long ? He was a shallow guy, he wanted the meal ticket that he was being offered and, yes, despite his disgust at the offerings he always ended up taking them. Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ? Because he was too scared, he didn't want to feel responsible for anyone else's pain. If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage. Joe enjoyed making a buck but he wasn't a completely uncaring man.As for Norma Desmond herself, she may well be the single greatest human character ever to be thrown onto celluloid. Half Quasimodo, half Bride Of Frankenstein and . . . . . . ummmm . . . . half Dracula's Daughter. Gloria Swanson bravely plays the faded movie star with a perfect mix of sadness, fiery anger, intense narcissism and pride, all mixed up with some mild overacting and permanent melodrama.William Holden is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie. Even if writer/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things.Max, the butler, IS the avid fan taken to the extreme. Devoted, adoring, ever-present, he's the perfect audience member and just what Norma Desmond needs to keep her sanity for as long as she does. Does he actually help her or is he ultimately responsible for her fall over the edge ? Max or Joe, who is the bigger culprit ? An interesting question that I'm not sure I could easily answer.Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth. Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio. If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of ""I AM big, it's the pictures that got small"") then maybe she would have eased back down to earth. If her ego and vanity would have EVER allowed it.The only real innocent character in the movie, the only one who doesn't help to perpetuate any fantasy and who doesn't act for purely personal gain, is Betty Schaffer. It is poor Betty who is quickly drawn in, chewed up and spat out by Holden's character (hmmmm . . . a writer responsible for breaking the heart of a young, up and coming lady . . . . surely not).I love this movie with all my being. I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house. The car and the swimming pool being returned to working order, just as Norma herself is, for the benefit of Joe. Are we watching Gloria Swanson playing Norma Desmond throughout this film or are we watching an older actress play every idol that we've ever discarded ? Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ? Am I reading too much into this film ? Maybe I am and maybe I don't care. Just see it and love it.",Sunset Blvd.
386,juded-57975,More like Fun-set Blvd!,10,14 November 2020,"Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 noir film directed by Billy Wilder. The plot revolves around Joe Gillis, a b-list Hollywood screenwriter in desperate need of money, and Nora Desmond, an ageing silent film star who believes she is still extremely popular.The movie excels at everything it tries at, all of the scenes are well-paced and are never dull, the performances are seen as some of the best performances of all time, the cinematography is lovely and the dialogue is extreme quote-able and character-driven. The film is saying so much about Hollywood, sexism, fame and mental health, which I don't think I have enough knowledge to tackle or dissect.I think something this film has notably paved the way for film noir is a non-linear timeline. At the beginning of the film, we see Joe Gillis, dead in Norma Desmond's pool. The main character's death is usually a plot point that is traditionally used at the end. But by knowing that it ends in death, it captivates the audience to see how that result came, which paved the way for other non-linear stories, such as Pulp Fiction (1994) and American Beauty (1999) in which the ending of the story is presented at the beginning.",Sunset Blvd.
387,belikemichaeldotcom,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,10,2 July 2004,"This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin.  It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note.  If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): ""...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces"", I'd like to also add that they ""didn't need movies; they had films.""They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10",Sunset Blvd.
388,Style_is_Substance,The Dark Side of Hollywood (abridged class paper),9,24 May 2016,"The narrator, Joe Gillis, is the most well-rounded character and experiences the most change by the end of the film. He begins as a struggling writer trying his best to escape paying his debts, then capitalizes on Desmond's offer to live with her and supporting him financially and acts as her lover, then eventually repents from feeding lies to her to start anew with Betty, which leads to his eventual death, arching back to the film's opening. The stand-out character is that of Norma Desmond, a faded silent film star who is drowned within her own delusions and narcissism. She does not change much at all throughout the film's duration, but her levels of pride, manipulation, and insanity come to surface the more Joe Gillis, as well as the audience, gets to know her as a person. While maintaining a great fortune, she still seeks work in the film industry to gain none other than attention from fans and moviegoers alike. She does not seem so much interested in playing a good role as much as she obsesses for attention she once had. It isn't just global attention she desperately seeks for, but also romantic attention from Gillis. Desmond is a wreck, and as the movie progresses, the more her craziness shines through, eventually reaching a point of no return. When the film comes to a close, so does her sanity. The monster she truly is comes to surface clear as day when the film closes with her posing in front of the camera with a clawing hand and a wide open mouth like a roaring lion. The film approaches its 1950 LA setting with a darkly bleak tone as it features the realities of how Hollywood can affect its own people, most notably, Desmond and narcissistic and delusional characteristics. A large majority of the film takes place within the mansion of Norma Desmond, which seems to change to match the moods of the character. For example, the mansion first appears dark, messy, yet seemingly empty and abandoned, much like that of Desmond's persona. As the film progresses and she begins to believe she is make a ""return"" to the screen, the mansion becomes more cleaned and lightened, as Desmond believing her dreams are soon to come true. The set design itself is rather engaging as the crew behind the picture blended with the film's main direction and cinematography really brings viewers into the foreboding world the film portrays. The small attention to detail includes the up-close shot of an empty pool full of dirt while the expensive Hollywood locations certainly expand the scope. When the characters of focus feel small, they are often in smaller environments then the larger- than-life characters inside large sets. The pool and house of Desmond looks glamorous the end of the film, as does the studio of Paramount Pictures. One could also question what is taking place solely for the viewer and what takes place within the world of the film. An example of a transition from diegetic to non-diegetic elements includes that of the opening title ""SUNSET BLVD."" stenciled on the curb of an L.A. street within the films world transitioned to the opening credits in the same font on the road, not within the film's reality. The film utilizes music, both diegetic and non-diegetic to convey subtle emotions of the characters. In one scene, Joe Gillis awakens from a dream stating he can still hear the organ song from the dream in his head, the audience hears this song transition briefly into non- diegetic score and then transition once more into diegetic piano playing by the character of Max. An example of music being excellently played, that can be questioned as to whether or not is diegetic, is the scene in which Joe Gillis quietly judges Desmond after her self- mutilation and contemplates his position with her, as the quiet music matches the feelings of the situation. The narration is arguably diegetic as the dead protagonist occasionally speaks directly to the audience using the word ""you"" such as in the closing narration. This narration throughout the film often contrasts the character's thoughts that are not being verbally expressed, such as his disdain towards the quality of Desmond's script. The film does not contain narration in every scene featuring Joe Gillis, but he is present in every scene leading up to his death with the odd exception of the scene in which Norma Desmond visits a studio and gains brief attention from fans. The narration aids in allowing the viewer to skip through time and back to tell the unique narrative structure. Before explaining the events that unfolded which led to his death, the character's body is shown floating lifelessly in a private pool. This beginning gives the audience something to anticipate and keep themselves guessing for throughout the run time. After hooking the viewer in with its opening, the narrative kicks off by establishing characters and leads into the inciting incident in which Joe Gillis hides his car at Desmond's mansion, agrees to work for her, and then move in. As the film progresses, he begins to feel disgusted by choosing that lifestyle, but makes the mistake of essentially becoming Desmond's lover. He breaks through this by sneaking out at night to write a script with Betty, which changes his arc, he begins to want nothing to do with Norma Desmond and threatens to leave which leads to the climax in which he is murdered. As Joe Gillis' character evolves, more is revealed about how strangely Norma and Max live and how delusional she truly is. There is foreshadowing throughout the film, including Norma's dead monkey hinting that Joe will be made a monkey out of himself, as well as the two main characters getting what they wanted, but not in the way that would be expected, for Joe, a pool, and for Norma, being in front of the cameras and becoming relevant once again.",Sunset Blvd.
389,TheNihalGursoyOfficial,A movie within a movie directed by Max,7,15 September 2014,"""Madame"" is still living in her movie which is also her own world. This hits he audience in the end of the movie in the creepiest way possible. However, until the audience gets to the end, they are given some clues to what kind of a woman this ""Madame"" is. She is a worn out star who is 50 and lives alone in a house which reminds us of Ms.Havisham from Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"". This bit of comparison is actually made by the narrator of the movie who is also one of the main characters, who is also Madame's platonic crush.The movie actually starts off with a death scene and then is narrated by the victim himself. Then goes back 6 months and is oddly narrated by the dead character. Joe is a writer in Hollywood who is after his Hollywood dream. However, he has realized that it is just a dream for him unlike Betty who is a script reader who has a passion for her job and later for Joe. They start working on a script together while Joe is in a complicated relationship with Madame. Things get tragic in the end because the movie ends in a traumatic way for Betty and Joe. Madame on the other hand, is just starting her own movie which Max is directing for her.This movie does the justice of putting a few smiles on the viewers face. In fact, in the end when you feel like you should be crying, you end up smiling because of the ridiculous feelings Madame and Max make you go through.So if you would like to see a fake movie within a real movie then this 1950s wonder is the right ""picture"" for you.",Sunset Blvd.

If Joe were to go with betty the movie would result into another cliché romantic film. The ending was great in a sense of the suspense towards Norma's craziness and that she has finally snapped and has fully become psychotic. It is a slow start but the whole suspense of the film and the question of how joe died in the beginning scene kept me up on my feet to see what happened. It also helps that It was a second time watching it, so I was trying to look out for some things that I missed which made it a little more intriguing. Finding out that the characters were inspired by the real life cast made it a lot more interesting too!

Billy Wilder directs this film with utter brilliance. More Hitchcockian than Hitchcock would have ever had made. The music score of Waxman remains in the ear long after a viewing. The cinematography of Seitz is beautifully crisp and sharp it puts many color films to shame. And it would be impossible to disassociate the film with the lead actress Swanson. So many classic lines but who could forget the greatest last line ever for a movie. It is the greatest Hollywood film about Hollywood ever made.,Sunset Blvd.

When talking pictures became the standard virtually overnight, the big studios turned their collective backs on most of the silent icons that had helped build them. This film offers a frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icons into despair and madness - and for silent film buffs, offers a rare opportunity to see the likes of Anna Q.

Bill Wilder is one of the first directors to take on the problems that can come with living in the spotlight. For it's time, the film is an original idea. I can't think of any other film from that time that explores the idea of being a ""has been"" in terms of Hollywood society.

William Holden does a wonderful job keeping Norma's fantasy world intact as Joe Gillis.",Sunset Blvd.
398,Mikeonalpha99,"""I'm ready for my close-up Mr. DeMille""",10,9 September 2005,"Rumor has it that Gloria Swanson was absolutely devastated that she didn't win the Oscar for Sunset Boulevard. 1950 was an unusually tough year for competitors, with the statuette eventually going to Judy Holiday for Born Yesterday. Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together. Director by Billy Wilder, Sunset Boulevard represents classic movie making at its peak. Set in Los Angeles, it's a dark, twisted, cynical tale of love, deceit, and opportunism. The film is all about Hollywood behind the scenes and how screenwriters, directors, and actors will sell themselves out for fame and fortune at a moments notice. Spiritual and emotional emptiness, and the price of fame, greed, narcissism, and ambition is at the heart of this devilishly stylistic film, with the somber mood beginning almost immediately when a dead man is found floating facedown in a swimming pool.The man is hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (a very sexy William Holden). All we know is that Joe was at the run-down mansion of deluded former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Through Joe's voice over narrative it soon becomes clear that he was somehow involved with the wealthy Norma. Down on his luck, three months behind on his rent, and with his car about to be repossessed, Joe accidentally stumbles upon Norma's faded mansion while trying to escape the police. Norma initially mistakes Joe for a coffin-maker for her deceased pet monkey, but once she figures out that he's a screenwriter, she gets him to read one of the scripts she's been working on. Norma is an insane and faded silent-film star, who is hoping against hope to make a comeback. She's bitterly resentful of the price the ""talkies"" have taken on her career, so now she soaks in her own misguided and imagined greatness, in profile with the flickering projector lighting her outline in the dark. Joe is initially hesitant to help the glamorous woman, and then asks $500 a week for his writing services. But slowly we come to realize the contract is actually the other way around. In preparing for her return comeback, Norma quickly turns Joe into a pawn - or more to the point, a slave. Joe becomes a virtual prisoner in her rundown mansion; the moment he leaves, she slits her wrists, forcing him to come back. With minimal resistance, Joe allows himself to settle into the life of a kept man, as Norma desperately showers him with gifts and fine clothing. The house butler, Max von Meyerling (Erich von Stroheim), grimly looks on, tending to Norma's demanding whims and tolerating Joe's disruptive presence.Joe wobbles back and forth between heedless acceptance of his strange companionship with Norma and his half-hearted pursuit of a career. He sneaks away to collaborate on a project with Betty (Nancy Olson), a Paramount script reader who is engaged to Joe's best friend. Betty is gradually falling in love with Joe, but when Norma finds out, that he's been sneaking out to meet wit her, all hell breaks loose. The self-loathing motif is rampant throughout Sunset Boulevard. Max completely does away with his self-respect, Joe hates himself for his unwillingness to commit to a career or love, and seems to sell himself out for money and clothes almost immediately, and Betty despises herself for falling in love with Joe while she's engaged to another. Norma, despite her haughtiness, is the most blatant case of self-disgust. When she isn't raving about her greatness, she comes across as a frightened and tortured soul  a sad and lonely woman, who is not only remarkably self-delusional, but is also trying to grasp one last chance at happiness. She thinks so little of her current 50-year-old self that she no longer acknowledges the present. Sunset Boulevard is a must see movie for cinema buffs. There are lots of treasures to be had here, including Nancy Olson's strangely under appreciated performance as Betty, whose misguided love for Joe spirals the film to its grisly conclusion. There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside. The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic. Billy Wilder's accomplished direction is full of wide shots that capture the depressing set and brave close-ups of our anti-heroes. But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.

399,inemjaso,A superb film noir,10,24 April 2017,"There is too much to say about this film in just 10 lines, especially considering I did this for my breakdown. Since that focuses primarily on cinematography and sound, I will talk about plot and acting. Joe Gillis, played by William Holden, is our alienated main character who gets caught up in debt with his lenders. Joe finds reprieve from his debtors and his Hollywood apartment when he comes across a deserted mansion belonging to silent film star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Swanson's performance in a word is chilling. Her delivery is purposely melodramatic to play off of her silent film techniques and her outdated conception of films. Her career is essentially dead and Joe's arrival provides an opportunity for her revival. Norma is one of film noir's most famous femme fatales, considering her obsession with Joe causes her to shoot him in the end. In the aftermath, Norma's delusions about her resurgence in film causes her to think the reporters crowding her estate are cameramen filming a scene for a new film. Norma's delusional perceptions of her own reality lead to her own demise and Joe's faith in her delusions led to his demise. The wisest character is undoubtedly Max, Norma's servant who keeps her satisfied by fueling the delusions and preserving her delicate feelings. Overall, this is a must watch film for any movie lover.

It's part mystery, part psychology a bit horror and full on art. It's full of iconic memorable lines as well. This is a must have classic dark film that is comfortably punishing to its main characters and an accurate depiction of what more than often eventually happens to those in the movie business.

What I will do here is to write about the story and ask myself what did i enjoy it. Well let's start in the beginning where the police find the dead body in the pool. Like many other movies I've seen the voice over narration really pulls you right into the story. Not only that but the black and white makes it a gorgeous film to look at. So right in the beginning you know this is a well crafted story. 
 This is the oldest movie i seen that uses the technique of showing you the death of a character and later rewind back and show you how they got to that point. But it felt right for the movie.  Joe Gillis is a poor screenwriter trying to make into hollywood. He does not have the means to sustain his vehicle. They are people who are trying to repossess his vehicle and so he tries bypass them by hiding in what looks like in abandoned mansion. But soon we realize that is not a abandoned mansion but that gloria Swanson lives there, a old Hollywood actresses in the silent era who longs to work in cinema again but is no longer relevant to the new era. There Joe Gillis starts working on her script that is full of silent era technique and consider to be a bad script. While living there for free Gloria Swanson become attached and Seemingly falls in love with him joe Gillis. The problem is that Joe Gillis does not share same feeling and therefore start to feel trapped in the life. The dilemma: He then must make a decision to be with Swanson and her lavish life but deal with her delusional fame and her fall to grace as a Hollywood actress or escape with a young screenwriter who is young and pretty but has nothing to offer for a stable career. The movie pacing is excellent . first we start caring for joe because he is broke and needs money. Then later we get interested in the life of Gloria Swanson and little by little we figure out the possessive character she is. That adds more drama for Joe because we see how unhappy he really is. This add more drama when he decides to leave at night and see another women. Until the final showdown where gloria goes to the extreme to stop joe from leaving.  Norma Desmond acting as Gloria Swanson was outstanding and exquisite, she stole the show and is deserving of my full admiration. Her role as a fall to grace Hollywood star was believe and we pitied her from the moment we realize that paramount did not want her up until she kills Joe and we see her outbreak to insanity. The scenes were she is preparing herself for the comeback to Hollywood really did hurt my soul. And of course that ending. When she steps foot descending from her bedroom to her destiny as criminal. The lights were switched on, the cameras were rolling and she was in front of the camera for the very last time. The euphoria that she felt in being that Hollywood star.  Grade: A",Sunset Blvd.

Life at the mansion is disturbed when young script writer Joe Gillis (played by the always excellent William Holden) uses the garage as a hideout running away from his car's repo men.Events begin to unfold which leave Joe questioning his own morality and standards. I won't get any further into the plot details just in case there are any other people out there like myself who haven't seen this film.A few interesting details I have learned about this movie which might interest some folks out there. Both Mae West and Mary Pickford were offered the Norma Desmond role before Gloria Swanson. Mae West didn't get it because she wanted to rewrite much of Norma's dialog. That was not acceptable to director Billy Wilder, who didn't allow any deviation from the script. Mary Pickford always retained ownership rights to her silent films. That wasn't going to happen with Sunset Boulevard so Pickford was out. Montgomery Clift was first offered the pivotal role of writer Joe Gillis and actually accepted the part. Thinking about the role while on vacation in Europe Clift came to the conclusion that the ""kept man "" aspect of Joe Gillis' relationship with Norma Desmond too closely mirrored his real life relationship with a wealthy New York socialite. Clift turned the role down upon his return to America.Hollywood had very mixed reactions to this film. Famous MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer stormed out after an early screening of Sunset Boulevard and engaged Billy Wilder in a very profane tirade accusing Wilder of stabbing the film industry in the back. Wilder gave as good as he got to the red-faced Mayer. If you haven't seen Sunset Boulevard do yourself a favor and check out this classic. It will stick with you for a while.",Sunset Blvd.
410,aubrimmer,Sunset Blvd.,9,13 December 2016,"This film was really good. It was interesting and showed the inside of the film industry. The movie had some great themes that showed through. It showed how everyone loved something but that love was impossible to achieve and if it does it doesn't last. It also showed dreams that are are difficult to achieve and tend to be unattainable. The movie was cynical, or maybe that's just the way I am perceiving it.The performance of Gloria Swanson was wonderful. She was convincing in her unstable frame of mind set on returning to the spotlight and stardom. She even makes a comment, ""stars last forever""(or something like that). She wants to return to the spotlight and make a comeback and be loved. Probably best shown through her obsession of the young guy who she ""held captive"" and how she wouldn't let him leave her.Like all film noir, the movie was dark in plot as well as lighting. Our poor hero was sadly killed by his femme fatale who was not all there(mentally) in the beginning the movie. The film was well done with the narration and interesting in how the story was told from a dead guy and the events leading up to his death. The movie also had some good commentary towards the struggles of the film industry on all sides and gave a little insight into behind the scenes of that world for the audience. It was a good suspense filled film I suggest seeing.",Sunset Blvd.
411,RUSkiddingPete,Sunset Boulevard,5,9 May 2017,"I was interested in the first 10 minutes of this movie, but sadly after that I began to lose interest in what was happening. I found most of the movie a little boring at times. The story is simple. A film writer needs money so he doesn't lose his car, as he is running away from the men that want his car, he walks into a famous but forgotten silent film actress. She is lonely and wants him to stay with her to keep her company, he is in need of money and she is rich and supplies him with all of this fancy stuff. He eventually gets sick of her buying him things, so he tries to leave. When he is trying to leave she goes crazy and says that she will kill herself if he doesn't stay. He walks out on her and instead of killing herself, she kills him. In the beginning of the film we see a dead body in a pool, now we know who the dead body was. I was disappointed with this movie, I would have liked it more if I was more interested in the story.",Sunset Blvd.
412,k-howell-77914,A Noir Masterpiece,10,6 November 2017,"Film Noirs come in all sorts of different portrayals. They range from familial conflicts such as Mildred Pierce, to watching another's internal struggle such as ""Sunset Boulevard."" It was a strange and beautiful movie, being extremely dramatic and dark, appearing to almost model Norma Desmond after her actress, Gloria Swanson in a strangely intimate way. So many characters of the movie were real people that I wondered if it were based off of a true story. To find out that it was not made for a more confusing and wondrous experience after watching. William Holden's narration was a comical and interesting addition to the story that fit nicely in place, and added a touch of omnipresence to his character, Joe Gillis after his death. ""Sunset Boulevard"" was a dark and wonderful movie, enjoyable and iconic down to the very last line.",Sunset Blvd.

It is shot in the most gorgeous black and white which truly gives the silver screen its name. Everything about this film is gorgeous. The lighting and shadows are masterfully done. The acting is wonderful. And the story is absolutely brilliant. It may be true that it's the same thing we've seen a million times since this, but this was the first. This was the film that started it all. The story is so out of the box and the tone is perfect. It was written and directed by a true master. This is a wonderful classic that will live on for centuries to come.",Sunset Blvd.
415,Victoria0708,Not what I expected...,5,11 November 2018,"This film left me speechless but not in the way most would think. I found certain parts of this film to be dull. For all the hype about how much of a classic it is, I didn't really see it. This film is about a washed-up millionaire silent film actor, who seems off her rocker from the very beginning, and ropes in a broke writer to her crazy world. This is referencing actual events because a lot of the silent film actors weren't good in the talkie films. There have been other films about this including Singin' in the Rain (1952) directed by Donen and Kelly. This being the part of the plot doesn't seem like it would make it a classic. There were some really good scenes like the one with Betty Shaefer and Joe Gillis writing a script together and walking about at night. I loved the lighting, the fluidness between the two characters and the way they instantly clicked together. The camera angles perfectly captured their facial expressions especially when they were out for a walk. But the rest seemed too drawn out and not very suspenseful.Although I didn't appreciate the film as some may, I did think that Holden played the character of Gillis very well. He was able to portray the emotions of the character, loneliness, depression, and a few others, through no words at all. Just through his posture, facial expressions and his tone. Nancy Olson did a good job with her character as well, Betty Schaefer. You could see her confliction about Joe and Artie and then she realized she didn't want to marry Artie and you saw the despair and the want for Joe on her face and in her posture. I didn't think Gloria Swanson was the right character to play Norma Desmond. Her face, posture, and how she looked just didn't fit with how imagine the character to be. Wilder did do some good things with this film, but in the end it just seemed pretty flat to me.",Sunset Blvd.
416,Ongoer1,Sleeping Gem,9,31 March 2019,"While I'm not typically a fan of old movies, this movie was fantastic. It had lots of character development & kept me guessing the whole time.",Sunset Blvd.
417,aeboynton,Sunset Blvd.,7,11 April 2010,"Norma Desmend, played by Gloria Swanson did an amazing job at portraying a mentally imbalanced person who dreams of returning to her previous life as a silent movie star. Joe gills, played by William Holden seems to be disconnected to Norma in that he lives with her and pretends to be there to write a movie script in which she is the star. The themes in this movie are still relevant issues today and that's one of the reasons I believe that this movie is considered timeless. Norma still yearns for the attention that being a movie star brings. She is holding onto her past life and therefore cannot move forward in any other aspect of her being. The movie did make me laugh in parts, at times because of Norma's disillusionment however at the end I just felt sorry for her. Like many people in Hollywood today, their acting careers fizzle out at a certain age unless they reinvent themselves significantly. This often is the case with child stars that then turn to acquire psychological issues or addictions to drugs or alcohol. I also think it is quit sad that her butler and ex husband still lives with her because he loves her. It seems like in this each character is not living but existing in their life. I think it would add a greater dimension to the film if the audience knew a bit more about max as her ex husband and the history of them.",Sunset Blvd.
418,rfrankssr,Brilliant and disturbing,10,1 January 2006,"Hollywood at it's best. A film that never ages with timeless performances by all. A writers dream script. What else could be said, except that we need more movies like this, even today. Mister Wilder's ability to draw in his audience, as he does with most of his films, is a feat many directors lack. The haunted story line with an underlying creepy nuance, makes you care for even the most despicable characters, and there are plenty here. Our one touchstone is the Nancy Olson character, but even she was willing to look the other way at one point as long as Joe (William Holden) would walk away. Simply a great film that has earned it's place among the best films ever made.",Sunset Blvd.
419,jolieschu,"Wonderful, dazing movie with a lot to say",10,26 November 2017,"This is a wonderful movie. I say this for a few reasons; the different characters you meet during your time watching each seem to have things to say about the state of Hollywood at the time. Although some of the commentary could carry over into criticisms of the same Hollywood today. I would even argue that some of the things the main actress expresses from the beginning to the end: could speak to some of the affects of Hollywood on child actors. One of the driving forces of this movie is the actions and behaviors of the former silent screen actress, that ultimately collide with the realities of the changing world. I feel this movie has a lot to say that you may not be able to catch with the first sitting alone. While it's not the kind of movie i'd recommend to relax to after a long day, it is an excellent one to watch. I promise an impression will be left on you after watching this; and some of the jokes are better understood if you have seen your share of older and a few silent films. Highly recommend.",Sunset Blvd.
420,gea-79784,An Interesting way to tell the story of a murder,7,9 December 2017,"I really enjoyed this film, it starts off with telling you that the protagonist is already dead. Then goes on to tell the story of the time leading up to his death when he stayed with an older famous actress from the silent era. The movie uses lots of narration so we get to hear what the main character is thinking constantly, this works really well as they use this in comedic ways constantly. It is ultimately a tragic story of an actress who is dying to make a comeback after 20 plus years away from the film industry. The story was so engaging i honestly forgot that the main character had been murdered in the beginning, so it really brought the story full circle when we see his downfall.",Sunset Blvd.
421,juliette-20138,weird but incredibly fascinating,10,9 April 2018,"This film was very well done with every aspect, from cinematography to plot. Gloria Swanson's wide-eyed facial expressions held such intensity that you could feel the crazy as if it were right next to you. The way the film is shot intensifies this mood even more: black and white that emits a powerful, severe feeling. I found the narration to be extremely effective; I felt very involved in the story as an audience member. All of the characters' (Max, Norma, Joe especially) psychological struggles were very fascinating to follow as well. The complexity hiding beneath the surface in this film is captivating.The plot is also odd but relatable in a way; I found the movie to be very applicable.. Not only do some recent movies parallel Sunset Blvd. (like Black Swan), but we can also see ourselves in Norma. As everyone knows, it is incredibly difficult to give up a dream you have worked so hard for, and although this film takes it to the extreme, we are warned of the devastating effects of a close mind not willing to see the greater picture. This film definitely critiques the Hollywood facade and illustrates the real effects of such a pressure cooker.",Sunset Blvd.
422,hayleygorman-43033,Iconic in and of itself.,8,4 April 2018,"The influence and everlasting effect of Sunset Boulevard is beyond doubt. A film made about a starlet from a dead era, but the movies she starred in hadn't even been cold in the ground yet! The bold, brash lines, and of course, the undeniably dynamic and purely iconic acting of Gloria Swanson. This is a film where the supposed main character, in this case Joe Gillis, is just a backdrop, a segue into the true protagonist and star of the show, Norma Desmond. The lighting to show mood and tone, the snappy and emotional dialogue. Not many movies like Sunset Boulevard are both a hit when they come out and a classic more than 50 years after, but this film nails it on the head.",Sunset Blvd.

424,pdortic,Past the usual hollywood glam,9,11 May 2018,This is a movie that shattered the pure image of classic Hollywood. It takes on the fact of their ideal image of beauty and the effect on women when they no longer fit that standard. The film follows a start that has fallen from her golden thrown and her deep seated struggles when all she has ever known is gone. To further complicate this there is of course relationship drama. This is a great movie to start off the 1950's and encompasses a classic film noir.,Sunset Blvd.

I like the fact the introduction included the death of a monkey but never referenced him at any other point in the film. At least, not that I can remember. I also appreciated the social commentary the film made about the pressures of staying relevant in the entertainment industry as well as, the internal aspects of moving up the ladder (so to speak) in Hollywood. It depicted the intensity and desperation of Hollywood so dramatically that it almost made it seem hyper realistic. It also had a very good balance of plot twists.",Sunset Blvd.

Although from the beginning you know something is off, you can't really put your finger on it. The ending was a complete surprise to me, including the last line, ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" Huge iconic quote and I had no idea it was from this movie. The lighting was amazing and was more fun than usual in this movie because of the content. The audience could see some of the lighting being used to ""film"".

429,ldanv,A FASCINATING CHARACTER STUDY,9,9 April 2020,"This film is a fascinating character study, a classic example of what happens when a delusional actress comes to believe her own publicity. The picture is well-written, superbly cast and acted, and moves at an excellent pace, with no unnecessary scenes.
The backstory of this film is almost as fascinating as the picture itself, and is the subject of a book, available from amazon. The male lead was originally offered to Montgomery Clift, who turned it down - some say because of his involvement with middle-aged torch singer Libby Holman, who told him to reject the script. Perhaps it was just too close to home. (The life of Libby Holman would itself make a fascinating film)
According to rumor the picture was actually based on the life of Corinne Griffith, one of the most beautiful women in silent pictures, who was also a real estate expert. When Norma Desmond states ""I own three blocks downtown,"" that was Corinne speaking - she did own three blocks in Beverly Hills.
Wilder and Brackett had been working on the script for some years when it finally jelled. The picture contains some famous lines that have become part of our folklore, such as ""I'm ready for my closeup."" I would recommend it to any student of the cinema, or anyone who is just a movie fan.",Sunset Blvd.

Swanson stole the movie and this is one of the best acting I've ever seen.Rating: 10/10William Holden and Nancy Olsen did okay jobs as the supporting characters but it was still good. Wilder also did well with the cinematography and directing in this. From the very beginning with the music and the narration, you know that something's going to be excellent.The plot was also suspenseful when you have two people like Swanson and Holden working together on opposite sides. The idea of having a ""Norma Desmond"" in ""Sunset Blvd."" gave it more mystery and made it more interesting.In conclusion, everybody should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime!",Sunset Blvd.
432,liamsroberts,The Darkside of Hollywood,8,18 January 2019,"At the time, Sunset Blvd. was one the movies that explored the underworld of Hollywood and its true face. It follows a struggling screenwriter and ends up in the hands of Norma Desmond, the classic femme fatale of film-noir. This movie takes a lot of risks and that's what makes it a very good movie. Many romance movies eventually end with the main guy getting the girl and they walk off the sunset. But this movie does not do that, it is very dark and it had to be work. The way it shows Hollywood as a dark place, especially during this time, by using actor or actress for a long time and then they just throw them away like an antique. It also shows that people who work in Hollywood aren't perfect people, everyone looks up to Hollywood like its a glamorous place, but the main character is trying to get away from paying his car bills and then, he also seduces a female screenwriter after she says that she is engaged. If the movie had ended with him going with Betty in the end, it would have gone against the purpose of the movie, and probably not make it a film milestone that it is today.",Sunset Blvd.
433,lcrews,Essential Wilder,10,3 May 2011,"Billy Wilder had a long and much-honored career as a director. He made some of the best light comedies of his or any other era, but his best and most essential films pushed the boundaries of Hollywood at the time. From The Long Weekend's devastating look at the reality of alcoholism, to the frank discussion of changing societal norms in The Apartment, to making Holmes and Watson homosexual lovers in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Wilder was always breaking new ground in what could be shown on the big screen.Sunset Blvd. may be his crowning achievement in boundary pushing, just because it is one of the most savage attacks on the mythos of Hollywood ever created. He spares no expense to bite the hands that feeds him, digging way deep beyond the glamor and into the reality of stars, former stars, and wannabes. The casting is dead-on, with Gloria Swanson and Ericj von Stroheim in particular--they had both been eaten up by the Hollywood system some time before 1950.Sunset Blvd's self-reflexive deconstruction of Hollywood myth would be enough by itself, but it's actually just one layer of many in a truly great film. It's also a fairly gripping detective story, downright funny in moments, and absolutely horrific in others--Swanson's famous ""I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Demille"" in particular can still send shivers down your spine. Besides being one of the all-time great directors, Wilder was a hell of a writer who collaborated with some of the best screenwriters in the business; his long partnership with I.A.L. Diamond is legendary, but this is the last of 13 collaborations with Charles Brackett, who brought just the right amount of pathos and tragedy to the script, no doubt aided by his experience working behind the camera in Hollywood for years.If you are a film buff or a student of Golden Age Hollywood, you will likely add Sunset Blvd. to your list of all-time greatest movies, but you don't have to be a film student to enjoy it either. It's dramatic, funny, chilling, and really just a joy to watch unfold. Many great films of the late 1940s and early 1950s are still enjoyable to this day, but even the best of them can seem somewhat dated today. Not so with Sunset Blvd., which is as potent and stunning as it was in 1950. One of the all-time best films, Sunset Blvd. is highly recommended viewing.",Sunset Blvd.
434,Molly04,Sunset Blvd Review,9,7 April 2010,"This extremely dramatic film noir was surprisingly a movie that I liked. Although at first glance, I admit I assumed it to be over the top or annoying perhaps but I was wrong, Gloria Swanson (famous silent film actress) stepped out of her silent film career to play this more well known role of her career. Surprisingly enough, this film is about Hollywood in the 1950's. William Hollden is a somewhat struggling film writer who ends up meeting Norma (Swanson). The pair make for a humorous yet strange pair throughout the entire film. The black and white film itself creates for an even more intense and certainly dramatic mood, it especially helps to atmosphere of the movie when scenes take place in Norma's gloomy old mansion. Narration throughout the film is in first person from Holden's point of view. The entire thing is a sort of- flashback, as most noirs are. Camera tricks such as fading in and out are used quite often in the film to add to dramatic effect as well. Of course the ending was my favorite part where Norma stares blankly at the screen and says "" Mr. DeVille- i'm ready for my close up."" I really liked this film a lot. It was visually and emotionally enticing.",Sunset Blvd.

The plot is really interesting because you see the inside of how a film is made, but also the underlying love story that goes changes throughout. The way Joe gets pulled into somewhere he thought he wanted to be, but realizes he needs to get out and write his films. The whole plot is well developed, as well as the movie itself is well made. Very intriguing movie and I would definitely recommend it.",Sunset Blvd.
438,wmberezowki,A well-aged classic,7,18 January 2019,"Although I found the plot and lines of Sunset Blvd. to move very slowly, I can't help but to admit how well the film aged. It tells the story it portrays in a creepy, gruesome manner which makes it that much more engaging. Honestly, if Joe left with Betty, I think I would've been slightly more satisfied with the ending even if it is cliche. The happier endings may be less exciting and interesting, but happier endings are better for peace of mind. That being said, I did enjoy the shock of the ending. They showed Norma's true psychotic break when she shot Joe and was still on about being a star. I also really enjoyed Joe narrating the whole thing even after he was dead, because I often wonder about the characters and what they think after their death. Overall great movie, just a little too slow-paced for me.",Sunset Blvd.
439,altheas-35492,A Movie That Makes You Feel for The Characters,8,17 January 2019,"This movie has aged very well. The plot was strong and the mood the characters gave off really made you feel for them and want them to succeed. Joe, specifically, made you root for him throughout the movie. After his first encounter with Norma you realized that she would trap him and he would be unable to escape the toxic realationship. After he met Betty, you really wanted them to run off together and for Joe to escape his problems at home with Norma. In the end, Joe is shot by Norma and it was his own fault. He had the opportunity to leave and he missed it. He allowed his feeling to overtake his mind and he was unable to think properly because he was trying to do what was best for Norma.
The mood of the movie would have concluded happy had Joe left with Betty when he had the chance. Staying to help Norma changed how you felt about Joe and gave the film a dark mood.",Sunset Blvd.
440,logansomerville,Sunset Blvd. Review,9,21 January 2019,This movie was pulling you in right from the start. Although it was tough at times to follow all the dialogue being thrown at you the acting in it was superb. It wasn't a cliche film with a happy ending but it the film drew you in right from the start knowing it was going to end badly. The film was gripping from start to finish. The characters were hard to really like other than Betty Schaefer but that was a huge pull in when Betty was pleading with Joe near the end of the film to come with her and drop the life he had with Norma. You want him to go so badly just for you to be let down knowing what is coming right from the start of the film. This movie despite being older has kept it's kick.,Sunset Blvd.
441,calderonp8,The Beginning of Film Noir,9,19 October 2020,"Sunset Blvd. is a story about an unsuccessful film writer who by chance meets a has been movie star of the silent film era, but after this, things only get more twisted. You could say this film was the beginning of a much darker time for film, and the first time people on the the audience could see that Hollywood was not all good and shiny as they had thought before. While this film might seem exaggerated in the character of Norma Desmond, who becomes literally mad with the idea of her past fame, there is truth in her character. Fame and money are funny things, while they make one seem powerful and beloved, these are the same things that can really bring out the worst in people, as we see in Sunset Blvd.The acting throughout the film is especially superb, I was really impressed with Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. I feel like her character would be such a hard one to play, but from the way she spoke to her gestures, I really believed she was a narcissistic actress who was indeed mad. William Holden (Joe Gillis) was also perfect for his role, as he plays a man who really hasn't had much success in following his dream, but he tries nonetheless. His character has a good amount of humour for a not so light film, and the way he acts tells us that he really is a good person. Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson I think is the impersonation of innocence, naiveness and goodness in an industry where those characteristics are rarely seen. She helps lighten the film and gives us hope that Joe can come out of the situation he has found himself in with Norma Desmond.This was one of the first, if not the first to use a non-linear storyline in a film, and it fits perfectly. The technicalities of this beginning sequence are also amazing, as they didn't use an underwater to film the body, instead they used a mirror to reflect, and that's how we see Joe's body. It was also shot in such a way that it was not really revealed this was Joe until the very end. This would later set the stage for other films, especially with a dark theme to use this form of storytelling; some of these are Pulp Fiction, Fight Club and 12 Monkeys.I really enjoyed this film, overall everything was great, and it was a really creative story that showed a darker side of something that people had generally thought was all fun and good. The way Cecil B. DeMille plays Norma's butler, and how he has ""protected her from the world"" by allowing for her to think that she is still relevant was simply great. The last bit of the film was perfect. Joe believes he is tainted, instead of leaving with Betty as he should have he prefers to let her go to spare her from himself in a way. Norma believed herself so great that she couldn't allow for her to be rejected, so in her rage and jealousy she killed Joe, fully bringing her down through the final steps of madness. I think that the way her butler brought a camera crew for her at the end was a mercy for her that she truly didn't deserve. This movie is a film because it shows what a self centred way of living and fame can do to people and that sometimes things that seem very good, are most likely flawed in a way inside.",Sunset Blvd.
442,evefarion,Twisted and Glorious,9,15 October 2020,"I think there is only one word to describe this film; Phenomenal. Sunset Boulevard paved the way for film making and storytelling today. Most definitely a film, (more specifically a film noir) it's dark narratives and 'rounded' story were what brought it to life. I was instantly drawn in by it's classic intro. The unexpected plot was a great refresher and the twist ending was a really smart addition to the narrative.I could honestly write this whole review about Gloria Swanson's performance. She managed to capture a failing artist's final grasp for stardom perfectly. This is because she was one herself. She didn't need to act so much as project. This is what I was most impressed by in Sunset; she chose this over many other roles and offers as her comeback. She found Norma Desmond a captivating character with tons of potential. And although the other acting was equally incredible, Gloria was simply the standout.Something I noticed in this film was that there was no true protagonist. Norma was flawed and toxic, manipulating Joe and everyone she met. She was trapped in the past, unable to forget how forgotten she was. Strangely, Joe was quite similar to Ms. Desmond. He only cared about his work and that he wasn't able to get any. He resented Norma for ruining him, when he had many opportunities to leave. Even in the end when Betty offered to forget everything and run away with him, he refused only to complain about it later. Because if this, he later met his demise, bringing Norma with him. I found myself unsure of who to root for, hating both Joe and Norma's actions throughout. Their chemistry was scarces and their failure in life was brought forward by the other.Sunset Boulevard was a jumping off point for films today, i.e Brick and Pulp Fiction. They are able to address dark topics and mimic the shots and cuts of the classics. Pulp Fiction mimics angles and takes influence from film noirs like Kiss Me Deadly. Primarily, they use the 'rounded' story to give their films an edge. They start with the end, before returning to the beginning to show you how we get to that point. This is able to capture your attention while confusing and drawing audiences in.
Sunset was the perfect starting point. They were able to convince us that the man dead in the pool had nothing to do with our main character, Joe. But as we continue, we learn that this man is in fact Joe. It's a smart way to shock your viewers and compel them. Overall, an intriguing film that delves into Hollywood's effect on their craftsmen, how desperate some are for stardom and how long and hard the fall from the top really is.",Sunset Blvd.
443,ryanvaine,another hollywood classic,7,16 April 2020,"Foe my ""History of American Cinema"" class, I had to watch a movie under the genre of film noir. The movie I chose to watch was, ""Sunset Blvd.,"" directed by Bill Wilder and released to the public in 1950. Film noir movies have an overall mood of pessimism, fatalism, or menace. I think this film had a strong mood of pessimism. This film had a very cynical view of Hollywood(especially during the 1950's), the plot line's message was how Hollywood makes people famous, then dumps them when they are no longer needed. The script is very clean, clever, and witty. There were a variety of camera angels, with clean transitions. I also enjoyed the element of romance throughout the film. The actors really embraced their characters and brought the script to life and made you feel emotional throughout the movie, because it seemed so realistic, and like these were real people going through hard times. The movie was shot beautifully in black and white, and gave off a very gloomy vibe. I really enjoyed this film and think it deserves all the success, because it is an interesting movie and makes you feel emotional involved. I recommend this movie to someone would wants to see a Hollywood film noir classic.",Sunset Blvd.

445,wearethefirstandlastnight,Sunset Boulevard is a Great and Dark Neighborhood,10,8 July 2021,"Sunset Boulevard is one of the great film noir classics and a pivotal movie of the era. It is one of the first to show the darkest shadows hovering over Hollywood. Sunset Boulevard unfolds like a kaleidoscope, like petals of a flowers dropping into tears. The center of the plot, the total convergence of fantasy and reality, is realized in a single moment in the third act, at the top of the staircase of Norma Desmond. Can you spot it? Fantastic characterizations and performances. We in the dark are mesmerized by its haunting message.",Sunset Blvd.
446,SakowskyBrothers,A film to strangle the genre,10,30 August 2007,"Sunset Boulevard set the style for epic Film-Noir movies everywhere. It inspired graphic novel writer/artist Frank Miller the creator of Sin City. It inspired the writing and screenplays of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan the brothers behind the movies The Prestiege, Memento, Batman Begins and the Following. It inspired most of the film-noir/ comic book crime genre that has evolved from it. This movie was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.It was a great story told threw the narration of Joe Gillis as William Holden whom was the main star of the film. It was basically him a washed up B screenwriter trying to make some money running into a famous actress who decides to give him a job Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. In end it develops a chain of events that makes Norma obsessed over William.Nothing really surprising about the film everything could be well predicted its just the dialog and acting that would flow to that point would tie you up to your seat handcuff your hands to the back and open up your eyes with clips Clockwork Orange style. It was a amazing film for semi-dark/mystery lovers who don't care for twists but rather just have a nice flowing plot with a satisfiable ending.The ending was decent but since you knew what was going to happen from the start of the movie it took away from it a tad. It was still a bit surprising however to the turn of events afterward but the lunacy of the acting from Gloria Swanson at the end took away from the flick in my opinion. Some may argue it was perfect others may say it was terrible, it was really a love it or hate it scene that I believe could have been done better. I just believe that she had better moments threw out the film.It was definitely a classic tale with near perfect dialog that inspired some of our industry greats. In end if your even remotely interested in the genre of Film-noir then don't keep strangling yourself with garbage and watch this film.",Sunset Blvd.
447,cory_j_adams,A Magnifacent Hollywood Satire,10,18 September 2011,"Sunset Blvd. is, though it is not considered, a satire. It tells a story of madness and corruption that thoroughly describes the way Hollywood was back then. There are three things that make this film great: 1)The Story: the classic tale of a star that has faded into Hollywood obscurity and driven herself mad by obsessing over the glory days of her youth. She finds her way back into the spotlight when she meets a young screenwriter and she thinks she is cured but doesn't realize that she is slowly fading deeper into insanity.2)The Director: Billy Wilder's ingenious direction is what practically makes this film. His intricate eye to detail is one of the things that makes this film a success.3)The Stars: Gloria Swanson, William Holden, Nancy Olsen, and Eric von Stroheim are the people that make this film what is today: a classic. Gloria Swansons stunning performance as Norma Desmond truly deserved the recognition that it received. I think her performance is the greatest of all time and was totally robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress.All in all, this my favorite movie and it is one of greatest films ever made.(P.S. This so should've won Best Picture instead of All About Eve. I mean, All About Eve is a great film but not as great as this one.)",Sunset Blvd.

He did an episode where he talked about the negative stigmatism calling your film a horror film. Horror, according to critics at that time, meant cheap and low brow.I watched this movie for the first time last night. I am now mad at myself for neglecting this movie for so many years. I woke up still thinking about this movie. This is a good movie.This is drama.This is suspense.This is horror!Prove me wrong.Side note: Is this the mansion during the shoot out at the end of Beverly Hills Cop?",Sunset Blvd.
449,Williliwaw,Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson Masterpiece,10,29 April 2006,This movie is so great that every time one sees it we gain new insights re the movie and notice new little things...it is in my opinion the best directed movie I have ever seen and Billy Wilder was a true Master of the Cinema. This is one of the great dramas of the screen and to think he also made likely the greatest comedy of all time Some Like It Hot..Gloria Swanson's landmark performance is one of the greatest in cinema history and together the fade out as Directed by Wilder and acted by Swanson is one of the greatest scenes in movie history.William Holden is classic in this movie and is perfect casting. However it is Swanson for whom we must save our most respectful applause. There is no other female performance that comes to mind ever that can top Swanon's. And to think she did not get the Oscar!,Sunset Blvd.
450,akafilms,One of the best films ever made,10,8 August 2018,"Where to start? The genius of Billy Wilder as a director is well know. All his films are masterful in direction. To me that means not a shot out of place. From the beginning, Holden dead in the pool, shot from the bottom of the pool and narrated by the dead man was ground breaking and genius. The casting of Von Stroheim, Swanson, Webb, and of course Holden is perfect. The cameo with DeMille incredible. Maybe its because I am a filmmaker myself that I get so much joy out of this film. I don't watch many films more than once but I just saw this again and couldn't pull myself away. The dialogue, cinematography, editing, sound and music are exacting, as a great film should be. I lived on Ivar in the 1970's I realize it was one block away from Holden's apartment. There is so much truth in this movie about the film industry and about life.",Sunset Blvd.
451,royalewcheese11,The very definition of a classic.,8,28 January 2015,"In an age when cinema generally succumbed to the tropes and clichés to which audiences were mechanically accustomed as a means for quicker cash, what better way to set the precedent of new and original storytelling as an art form than Billy Wilder's introduction to the 1950s, Sunset Boulevard - a film that explores excitingly unfamiliar territory while simultaneously presenting itself as a meta commentary of such transformation in the motion picture industry. A master of genre versatility, Wilder makes significant alterations to film noir with the addition of a light comedic backdrop, still managing to close on a note of poignancy that lingers in the mind, cementing the film as a landmark in movie history.We know immediately that we are in for something unusual for the era as the protagonist, Joe Gillis (William Holden), appears to be narrating from beyond the grave, the accompanying image containing the silhouette of Joe's floating corpse in a swimming pool. As police arrive on the scene, the rest unfolds through flashback explaining the events that led to our hero's demise. Going back to the start, we learn that Joe is a Hollywood screenwriter struggling to succeed in the dying business. After establishing his desperation as he is unable to sell his most recent script or persuade his friends to loan him money, matters get worse as he is chased by repossession men. One of his tires blows out, and he makes the quickest turn into the garage of a deserted mansion on Sunset Blvd. There he meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a long-forgotten silent film star who is determined to make a triumphant return to the screen with a project she has written herself. When made aware of his experience, she hires Joe as an editor. Her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim), puts him up in the guest room for the duration of his stay, ultimately extending much longer than he had anticipated. Thus begins a gradual obsession that deteriorates Norma's sanity, and Joe may be in too deep to find a way out.Wilder, along with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr., provides the film's most extraordinary facet in his ingeniously crafted screenplay, earning a well-deserved Academy Award. It achieves thorough effect in blending tones, revealing twists and building conflict of all sorts. Even more impressive is the sharp wit and humor of the dialogue, giving the material infinitely more enjoyment than generic Hollywood output lacking any personality. It also fascinatingly utilizes subtle hints of symbolism and movie references, further improving the experience for film buffs in more way than one. His direction is also expectedly very good, bringing the content to life with skillfully constructed imagery and smooth editing work that flows sufficiently. A detractor from the impact, however, is the conventional use of music that hits every note one would expect at every moment they'd expect it. This is a technical aspect that is vital in evoking the right viewer reaction and unfortunately it does not always do so, making it the main attribute in which Sunset Boulevard resembles the majority of other works of its time. Even still, the positive certainly outweighs the negative as the great ensemble helps to carry the film, and is one of the very few to garner Oscar nominations in each acting category. Holden is a slick and likable leading man as always, while making Joe a sympathetic man with an internal battle as he must decide between rational logic and his heart. The love interest whom Joe desires is played by Nancy Olson, who does an adequate job of creating natural chemistry with Holden, though it may be slightly rushed and lacking emotional investment. Also intriguing is von Stroheim as the mysterious butler whose past with Norma may consist of more than meets the eye. This leads us to the one creation that drove the film beyond mere acclaim and is primarily responsible for the reason Sunset Boulevard is regarded as an all-time classic.The characterization of the deliciously psychotic Norma Desmond is absolutely brilliant, as Swanson's Oscar-nominated portrayal seamlessly conveys a woman who believably achieved fame long ago and is now stuck in denial that it ever disappeared. Joe recalls that she ""used to be big"", to which she replies with a disdaining tone, ""I am big. It's the pictures that got small."" If ever there was a performance that should truly feel like a performance, it is this one. Norma is a forever doomed actress who cannot escape the theatrics of a lively, expression-based movie star, and therefore her delivery of each line and movement is pervaded by a larger-than-life air of grandiose. Not only does this make for a highly interesting character to observe, but also often infuses her presence with hilarity and delight as she permeates every situation with unnecessary dramatics that come to be rather predictable. That is, until her mental instability spirals into a maniacal state, leading to a drastic climax followed by the iconic ending scene in which she deliriously makes her way into the spotlight for the cameras one last time, telling the hallucinatory director: ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up."" The film is not quite the masterpiece it is hailed to be, but it deserves immense appreciation for its sheer braveness and creativity. It indeed holds all the essential ingredients of a classic, with memorable moments that now inarguably contribute to defining the medium as a whole. A sense of freshness also separates it from the pack, and it is both entertaining and thought-provoking enough to warrant multiple revisits. Most importantly, the character of Norma Desmond and the conclusion to which her story comes is unforgettable, the finale inducing a sensation that deceives the softness of the film's earlier atmosphere and instead leaves us on a note that is all at once tragic, disturbing and darkly funny. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a crucial part of cinema that is essential viewing for any film-goer.",Sunset Blvd.
452,d-touponse,Sunset Blvd. (1950),10,7 November 2017,"This dark shadowy film noir was an excellent classic that I recommend to anyone. It is funny, dramatic,and tragic. Although the humor is dark it is tasteful. The opening scenes of Sunset Blvd. are some of the most famous in motion picture history. After the opening credits, the camera follows motorcycles and police cars as they pull up to a Beverly Hills mansion where a body floats face-down in a pool. Then a voice over narration begins telling the story of a dead man. The house is almost another character altogether and an amazing mise en scene for a film. Film lovers will love the movie driven story, fantastic performances and great direction. It's one of the few movies that will be well known forever and never forgotten.",Sunset Blvd.
453,andyjung,Great counter-Hollywood commentary,8,18 January 2019,"Sunset Boulevard excellently illuminates the excess of Hollywood in that era. Joe is a burnt-out, unemployed writer, while Norma is a fading star, still convinced she is a supernova. The characters self-destructive actions and exciting dialogue is enough to captivate the audience up until the bitter end.Joe's refusal to leave with Betty is the final setpiece that truly defies Hollywood tropes. I love this ending, even though I had dreaded it for the entirety of the film. Had he left with Betty, the ending would have felt empty and cliché, and I am happy with the direction the film took.",Sunset Blvd.
454,brianhan-84901,"Medicore, or I'm just dumb.",6,19 February 2019,"Sunset boulevard was a 'good' movie. This isn't a lazy observation or a lazy review. It was 'good'. The space between a mediocre film and a great film. It's story was intriguing but was dragged on. The lines were delivered well, but the writing itself was mediocre.
Sunset boulevard, being one of the most famous black and white films, was a bit of a disappointment for me. It felt like a normal film to me. It didn't stand up to what I heard about it. It's was just... a movie. Maybe there was a deeper underlying tone that I didn't understand due to my simple knowledge of films, but I felt nothing still. The characters were intriguing, especially the two women, but the main character itself was viewed (by me) as a normal man. Maybe that was the cool part of him. I do not know.
I feel like this movie had something greater under its face. If I'm too dumb to understand it, I'm the dumb one. But for a normal guy like me, this was nothing but a normal old film.",Sunset Blvd.
455,francodelrosario,Artistically Captivating Masterpiece on the Perilous Power of the Limelight,10,10 May 2006,"Few filmmakers dare to open the curtains to the public on what really takes place beyond Hollywood's glitter and glamor as Billy Wilder did with SUNSET BLVD. Unforgettable performances, effective visuals, faultless, inventive direction and a biting, comical and melodramatic screenplay make this a legendary film on filmdom.Joe Gills' (William Holden) corpse is seen floating in a swimming pool while his off-screen narration recalls his dangerous professional and personal involvement with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the events leading to his demise. Joe, a B-movie screenwriter, inadvertently winds up at a decaying mansion, where faded silent film-star Norma takes residence with her faithful butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim). The insane Norma has certainly past her prime but she mistakenly believes she can achieve a ""return"" as an actress again. Joe wishes to leave but when Norma insists that there will be serious cash involved, he takes on a job offered to him as an editor of her defective, self-indulgent screenplay. At first, Joe, who is now obliged to live with Norma, is treated like a gigolo, having every one of his needs catered. However, when Joe secretly co-writes a script with the attractive level-headed Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma takes extreme measures to assure herself that she is a star who will not be abandoned.Wilder productively creates the eerie, dreamlike and surreal atmosphere in the beautiful black-and-white images of the crumbling mansion and the wicked, wraith-like characters. Nevertheless, not a single characteristic of the film seems fabricated or fictitious. Its sense of realism is undeniable. Many can relate to Desmond - rejected by Hollywood after years in front of the camera. Another unusual yet valuable aspect is its sense of humor and ability to laugh at itself. Even the most famous lines in the movie are both heartbreaking and amusing, intensifying the illusion that Norma has forever been a superstar.Gloria Swanson is exceptional in her magnum opus and most memorable role as the purely malevolent, manipulative Norma Desmond, a woman stuck in the past. Gloria, herself, was a silent movie queen of her time and had been missing from the silver screen for 16 years. Now, it is unimaginable to picture anyone else as Norma. Though less remarkable, William Holden is excellent as a skeptical screenwriter knowing Norma won't be able to attain the star-status she once had. He has moral flaws of anyone walking down the street but he slowly becomes the likable protagonist. Just as competent is Erich Von Stroheim who plays the silently sadistic butler, who guarantees Norma that she has always been the celebrity that she thinks she is. The final major character is ingénue Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson. Her composure and calmness is a pleasing contrast to Norma's irrationality.SUNSET BLVD. is really a black comedy-satire with a sardonic, derisive screenplay, film-noir with perfect direction and character-driven drama with terrific acting all together. Though most significantly, it is a painfully captivating work of art and a candid peek on the fickle world of showbiz and its devastating effects.",Sunset Blvd.

457,ss3,What about Charles Brackett,9,22 February 2005,"I have no problem with the acclaim Billy Wilder has received for this movie but I would like to call attention to Charles Brackett, probably the main writer. In particular I would like to see his ""To Each His Own"" a very fine tear jerker, made into a DVD. Brackett had a deep sensitivity to the older women he wrote about. He should be rediscoveredAll the usual kudos about this movie are well deserved. I don't personally enjoy it that much because I find it hard to react to creepy characters even when I can understand them and my head tells me this is true and well done. But as a character Norma Desmond is unforgettable, powerfully executed if unappreciated by me.",Sunset Blvd.
458,Aboxofbread,More than just a story,9,14 October 2020,"Sunset Blvd., to this day, tells such a real story. The young Hollywood star being shoved out when not needed anymore, and the struggling writer who is sure he'll someday make his break; two stories colliding with the unwavering need for success. It is this fight for fame that makes this film so endearing and creepy. That, and Norma Desmond's destroyed, cluttered house, which creates a perfect setting for the story. The house is so suffocatingly sad with all the photos and sculptures that whenever the story goes somewhere else in Hollywood, it's like a breath of fresh air. The nights when Joel and Betty were writing in her office was like waking up from a dream, because it was so mundane and 'real life' compared to Norma Desmond's false reality.
Sunset Blvd. fits flawlessly into the genre of film noir, what with Joel's murder and the crazed Norma Desmond bringing an eerie feeling to all its viewers, but it also does what previous silent and talking movies didn't. It added layers and a complex storyline that more could connect with, instead of just some grand adventure of mystery where everything turned out fine. It wasn't made to tell some happy story where a man and woman meet and fall in love. It told the truth. It told the story that so many Hollywood actors lived through, showed that not everyone in the industry is somebody.

The photography was sublime and the scenes weren't too long, they somehow managed to do a good editing job, so ahead of his time. People lost that class some humans used to have back in the fifties, I don't know how to explain.... maybe it's just the way they all stand up so d*mn straight....A big Kudo for Swanson, which delivered an oscar worthy performance. She was better than both Crawford and Davis in Baby Jane, her silent movie skills shown every single emotions it needed to, in the most perfect way, it gaves me shiver and she is no milf... as a matter of fact I'd rather go with the Butler and the Boy Toy.... at the same time.... but this isn't the place to talk about it.... The fact that a woman was taking the patriarcal role in the relationship by providing the ressources must have been groundbreaking for 1950, but anyways.

But overall, sunset boulevard was nothing more than a slow, boring mess that lead up to a somewhat climactic ending. Mediocre is the perfect word for this film, starting with the less then average start all the way to the positively sad, unrealistic murder of Joe Gillis near the end of the film. Although I will congratulate the film for the very end, In which a deranged femme fatale , Norma Desmond, Is directed by her butler to walk through her house to the police. The way in which that scene was presented was quite interesting and a good ending for the surviving characters present. But, even with a pleasant ending, It still wasn't enough to get this boring, tedious, blunder of a film to grab my attention for more than 5 minutes at a time. I may be wrong and this may be a classic masterpiece.

469,islander-14,The professional drama queen.,10,26 September 2007,"The most admirable thing about this Billy Wilder masterpiece is the courage it took to make this film. 1950 is exactly in the middle between the self-imposed production code and the anti-American pogroms. In that narrow window comes this scathing satire of Hollywood glam in the same year as All About Eve. Both 1950s are an indictment of the soulless packaging of the movie business. Both take the point of view of the ambitions and the frustrations of leading ladies that lived long enough to witness their fading. Both were nominated for best film. All About Eve, perhaps because it was more direct and less metaphorical about its subject manner, won the day. It is no doubt a good film but today we recognise Sunset as the superior work.Many people play themselves in this film. Buster Keaton leads a team of vaguely recognisable 'wax works' whose wrinkling bodies are dying monuments to their glamorous silent movie pasts. C.B. de Mille plays himself as a survivor that transcended the transformation of the movie business.But Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim are also playing themselves in this roman-a-clef where all their change about this autobiographical performance is their names.Gloria Swanson was Norma Desmond: in shared historical experience if not in personality traits. She had been a great star of the silent movies, her face known and admired world-wide. A 17 year old girl 'discovered' by Hollywood, placed on the front row of a joy ride into fame and fortune, only to be discarded when the pictures 'became too small' for her to fit in. That phrase is how she is introduced to us. William Holden's Joe Gillis vaguely recognises the dark dame in her desolate temple. 'You're Norma Desmond. You used to be big.' 'I'm still big,' comes to retort, 'it's the pictures that become small.' The butler in this palace of regret and memory is Max played by von Stroheim. Half way through the film, when in an exposition scene the history of the relationship between butler and dame becomes clearer to us, Max tells us there were three young directors in the early days of Hollywood that showed much promise: D.W. Griffith, C.B. de Mille and himself, the butler. If he said the third man was the actor who played the butler he'd have been perfectly accurate.Have-beens are a fact of life in every industry but there is, or at least should be an inherent sadness, in the cynicms of an E! special about one-hit-wonders or what ever happened to that forgotten child-star. Gloria Swanson and Better Davies (in the other 1950 Hollywood-themed movie) are representative of what must happen all the time. That in itself is no bad news. I suppose cabin crew, athletes or whoever else relies on their appearance for their living all have the inevitably early sunset ahead of them in their minds.What is particular about the movies is that persons - their appearance and more importantly their capacity to incarnate in their acting the emotions and ambitions of those who watch them - are packaged as a product that is valuable only while it waits for the next best thing.That's the theme of the film. Consider now its quality. The movie uses the device of a narrator but with the knowledge, revealed very early in the film, that our narrator has died a few hours ago and he only exists because we need to be put in the picture of understanding why he is dead.We also need to understand how he came about to meet this one particular end. He's floating, face down, in the swimming pool of a huge mansion on Sunset Boulevard. And the curiosity is awakened by the odd perspective with which we see the corpse, looking up at its face from the bottom of the pool.This is the particularity of the cinema, which allow us to look and see from corners and angles impossible in the physical world. But cinema is the subject of this film. Consider now therefore the concluding scene as Norma walks down the staircase of what is physically her house from which she is to be taken away but in his mind is the set of C.B. de Mille's great new production starring her.First we see the cameras. They are newsreels hungrily shooting this new juicy scandal. But Norma wants to believe they are C.B. de Mille's cameras. 'I'm ready for my close-up now Mr. de Mille.' And she looks straight in our eyes as she addresses us who are guilty of her tragic existence. It was our hunger for glamour and success that thrust upon her the role of a star. As our boredom as an audience sets in and we switch to younger stars she is left knowing nothing better but her need for attention.It is that odd relationship between stars and audiences that Billy Wilder sets up for us in Sunset Blvd. This is not a one-way affair and when we abandon our stars, they have a right to feel betrayed. We should not be surprised that artists whose function is to magnify several times over human emotions (this is especially true of the silent pictures) deal with this betrayal with this sort of drama. Who has a better right to be a drama queen than a professional drama queen?",Sunset Blvd.
470,imt206,One of the greatest movies ever made,10,12 April 2003,"As someone who works in this industry, I know what it does to a person, and also what people will do to make it.  That is the story of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, one who has reached the pinnacle of success in Hollywood, only to have to have lost her youth and beauty and forgotten; and another who is struggling at the bottom to make it and will do just about anything to achieve that.That parallel is what makes this movie so genius.  Norma Desmond is one of the great characters in cinematic history, and Gloria Swanson does a phenomenal job portraying her.  I had only seen Gloria in silent films previous to this, and was doubtful of her ""speaking"" abilities, but she just absolutely nails this role.  I cannot imagine anyone who could have done this better than her.  Especially that end scene, where she does that eerie dance down the stairs and raises her eyebrows and walks into the camera. Absolutely Fantastic!Although William Holden was amazing, I kinda would have liked to have seen how Montgomery Clift would have pulled it off.  I think what was appealing about Monty was that sensitivity and vulnerability he portrayed, and I think that would have worked very well in this role.Other than that, the casting was perfect.  Erich von Stronheim was excellent, and what is scary is that he used to be a up and coming director in the 20s.  Nancy Olson had that innocent, wholesome look that was perfect for Betty, the only character in this movie that gives this industry any redemption.  For that reason alone, I would have given her the oscar over Josephine Hull.I know that Billy Wilder was one of the people who wrote this script, and if he came up with that line, ""I'm still big, it's the pictures that got small,"" on top of his direction of this movie, he is absolute genius.One of the ten greatest movies ever made.",Sunset Blvd.
471,joberthefboom,"Tragic, horror, Hollywood",9,12 June 2020,"Sunset Blvd. is the gloomy tale of failing screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). Right from the beginning you know his story is doomed to end in tragedy when we see his body lifelessly floating in a pool. It sets the tone for darker things to come, we are following around a dead man.Joe Gillis, an aspiring screenwriter with a couple of features to his name, can't seem to catch a break. He has no money, no one can give him a job and even his agent leaves him. Whilst on the run from creditors he ends up at, what looks like, a deserted mansion. To our shock we learn the mansion is actually inhabited by forgotten silent moviestar Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her loyal servant Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma, clearly insane, can't accept the fact that she has faded away and spents her time in the illusion that she is still the biggest star of them all. Joe becomes entangled in her fantasy and agrees to help rewrite Norma's story, for which she has high hopes of sparking her glorious comeback.Gloria Swanson sparkles in one of the best acting performances of all time. Always on the brink of mental breakdown, never truly reaching it until the end.
Joe, who finally has enough of her drifts of melancholy and insanity, desides to leave her. Him leaving her puts her over the edge. ""No one ever leaves a star."" Norma says ""Thats what makes one a star."", and both Joe and the viewer know she has now completely lost touch with reality. In one of the most memorable endings in cinematic history we see Norma descends down the staircase. It is as if she is reaching out to the audience in one last attempt of regaining her glory. ""You see this is my life, it always will be! There's nothing else, just us and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark.""Billy Wilder masterfully directs the movie, combining satire and tragedy to create the ultimate Hollywood horror story. A case study of what fame can do to people and the coldness of Hollywood. It shows us the illusions that come with stardom even though we are supposed to see through them.",Sunset Blvd.
472,anna_kouremenos,One of the greatest films,10,3 October 2007,"Sunset Boulevard is rightly considered by The American Film Institute to be one of the greatest films of all time. The story of an aging actress and a young struggling writer has timeless appeal. This movie should be noted for the importance of its various settings - Norma Desmond's house, the Hollywood film studios, the writer's office - which play a very important role in the story. The choice of narrator is a particularly innovative one and makes the plot even more compelling. The acting is superb; Gloria Swanson perfectly portrays Norma Desmond's increasing narcissism and vulnerability and the inclusion of various older Hollywood stars who play a bridge game with Norma was a nice reminder of the silent era.",Sunset Blvd.
473,Flups21,Undoubtedly one of the greatest American films of all time,10,22 August 2013,"Sunset Blvd. is an absolute masterpiece. From the first word spoken to the last you can see and hear how well written the script was. It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes. I only hope that younger people continue to appreciate the depth and range and how very special and brilliant this film, its script and cinematography are.",Sunset Blvd.
474,MST3Kfan1966,The dark side of Hollywood in glorious black-and-white,10,28 May 2002,"This picture takes the happily-ever-after myth of Hollywood stardom and shatters it for good.  When talking pictures became the standard virtually overnight, the big studios turned their collective backs on most of the silent icons that had helped build them.  This film offers a frequently sympathetic view of the descent of one of these icons into despair and madness - and for silent film buffs, offers a rare opportunity to see the likes of Anna Q. Nilsson and Buster Keaton in speaking cameos.  Billy Wilder's genius as a director is evident in the way that the very adult relationships among the principal characters are conveyed perfectly, under the yoke of the Hays Code, without the use of nudity or profanity",Sunset Blvd.
475,Charlie_Kane,the REAL Gloria Swanson,10,12 December 2006,"I just want to clear up a misconception about Gloria Swanson and her performance as Norma Desmond. Gloria Swanson was NOTHING like Norma Desmond in real life. At the time she was offered the role, she was very busy (thank you very much) in New York with, among other things, pioneering early live television. She had a very busy family and social life, and wasn't that keen on returning to California and the silver screen. She was, however, very intrigued with the script, and was talked into it by Wilder. When she got to the coast and began to make contact with some of her old friends from the silent days, she was very disturbed and a little freaked out to discover that there were indeed many ""Norma"" cases hidden in the Bel Air hills. She was shocked to find many of her old acquaintances were stuck in the past, where as she had moved on and never looked back. She then actively sought out these people and began studying them, incorporating parts of each of them into her portrayal of Norma Desmond.A couple of interesting stories about the making of this movie are worth relating. In 1948, Billy Wilder and his collaborator, Charles Brackett were searching for story ideas. They were lunching at Chasens restaurant in Beverly Hills and Wilder noticed an aged, apparently ""homeless"" man hovering around C.B. Demille's table. Wilder observed DeMille motioning the old bum over and whispering something to him. The bum shuffled out. Intrigued, Wilder filed the incident away. Several days later he ran into De Mille on the Paramount lot and asked about it. ""Oh yes, that was old Griffith asking for work again."" Aghast, Wilder asked ""Griffith WHO?"" ""D.W. Griffith"" Demille simply replied, and walked away. It so shocked Wilder that such a titan of the film industry could become such a severe hasbeen, could have fallen so low. It gave him and Brackett the germ of the idea that eventually became ""Sunset Blvd""-the true, unvarnished look at how Hollywood treats its ""living legends"".Another interesting story occurred at the films Hollywood première. It was, of course a huge, star-studded affair. Everyone who was anyone was there. After the screening, L.B. Mayer, then recently deposed head of MGM and one of the most powerful of all movie moguls stormed into the lobby. Billy Wilder was there, holding court, and enjoying praise from all. ""You muckraking scum! You've ruined this town with this filthy picture! You and your kind are ruining our industry!"" Mayer barked in Wilder's face. Wilder, with an ever so faint smirk on his face clucked his tongue and said ""Go f@ck yourself""",Sunset Blvd.
476,a-tsitsos,Film-Noir at its best,9,6 January 2014,"After spending time and time watching this movie genre,I believe that I can say with clear mind that its the best so far.The movie goes further than the ordinary Private Eye hero and makes a brilliant use of photography music and message giving.The acting is great and the directory more than pleasant.The story follows the hero though his dangerous life and romantic point of view.Even if you prefer the private eye noir style you will be very pleased of watching it.Smooth music and fantastic dialogs bond with the other advantages of the movie.Defenatly a great movie.The only noir genre movie than can be compared with is Double Infinity another not P.E noir.Wilder has many times shown as his talent.But with this film his fame as a top director of his time.This film might be like an old romance movie with a taste of mystery but as you continue watching you the plot shows elements that were hidden in the first place.Madness,true love,the feeling of being prisoned.The actros are just great,they feel the moment giving as a great finale that will always be remembered.A sad moment of course is the death of the main role and that he like a writer that he is never completes his story a story of madness and love.He never gets to see how the story that himself is narrating.The audience of course watches the finale with agony.",Sunset Blvd.
477,efren_aa,Flawed multi-layered story,6,12 November 2017,"Let me start this review by saying that this is a good movie. The plot works on various levels with different interpretations and an actual focused theme. It's not just a love story, it's an honest Hollywood depiction, it's a meditation on fame and time. Good work there! The movie, though, presents some important flaws. Most relevant the off- voice, which was distracting at the beginning and honestly very on-the- nose sometimes, not centered in giving feedback or highlighting a concrete point, but rather there as a lazy job on the director's part. Swanson's performance (what an appropriate name!) is borderline unwatchable by the way.",Sunset Blvd.
478,seanwilson-556,Timeless masterpiece,10,5 December 2016,"Billy Wilder is slowly becoming my favourite filmmaker ever. In what is arguably his greatest film, Sunset Boulevard takes on the dream machine that is Hollywood, and succeeds in providing a scathing, haunting and bleakly humorous film that will remain timeless, as long as films continue to exist.Bare witness to a simply stunning and equally disturbing performance from Gloria Swanson as film star Norma Desmond, whose fame and popularity faded into obscurity during the arrival of 'sound' films. William Holden plays struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis. Gillis, who seriously considers giving up Hollywood and returning to his hometown in Ohio, ends up in Desmond's fantasy world and its dangerous consequences.Wilder, who also co-wrote the film, slowly and meticulously deconstructs the Hollywood dream by creating detailed and developed characters, a whole historical background behind them and the famous locations of Tinseltown for the viewer to immerse themselves into. Beautifully directed, with a range of amazing visual shots, the world portrayed on screen gradually becomes more sinister as Norma Desmond's mental state goes from fantastical and theatrical to terrifying and dangerous.More than a film noir, more than a psychological drama, more than a bleak and bitter black comedy, Sunset Boulevard is rightly a highly placed work of art. Along with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, this film continues to stun me with its savage analysis of a town obsessed with fame, fortune and immortality, and the darkness behind it all.",Sunset Blvd.

DeMille, the spotlight operator trains the spotlight upon her as the curious younger generation gathers around.Norma is eating up the attention, and the viewer may even begin to hope beyond hope that her plan might get off the ground when DeMille--old, weary, and pitying--calls up to the man and says,""Okay, put that spotlight back where it belongs.""And the crowd melts away.

482,bullenjessica,Ghosts of The Past,8,15 October 2020,"Sunset Boulevard was an extraordinary film that portrays the afterlife of has-been silent film actress, Norma Desmon, (portrayed by Gloria Swanson; a silent film actress herself) from the perspective of a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis ( portrayed by William Holden). The concept of the film was very unique and set the stage for well-known films such as Pulp Fiction. The film starts at what is actually the end of the film, with a dead man floating face down in a pool. I really like it when films do this because it gives you a taste of what's going to happen. It leaves you wondering.It wasn't until the film was nearing its end that it became clear that Joe Gillis was the dead man in the pool. I'm not sure if that was intentional but I couldn't really make out the face in the pool well enough to make the connection. This certainly didn't affect the outcome of the movie for me. I still enjoyed the surprise. The story itself is really captivating. It paints an interesting picture of Hollywood at the time and the silent film actors who suffered after the addition of sound to movies. Norma Desmond, lives a lonely life of luxury with her ex husband/director turned butler, Max Von Mayerling (portrayed by Erich Von Strohiem; a silent film director of his time). Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Anna Q. Nilsson (portraying themselves) make a ghostly cameo at one of Norma Desond's card games, enjoying get together with old silent film pals. For some of those actors, it was their first role in forever, despite being beloved by millions on the silent film screens of the past. The choice to cast silent film actors and directors really helps convey the story director Billy Wilder is trying to tell. The film was a really enjoyable watch. The story was compelling and heartbreaking and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a tragic tale of struggling artists.",Sunset Blvd.
483,taylaschaffer,"Gloria Swanson is indeed ""the greatest star of all""",10,28 October 2020,"An iconic film from the 1950s, that set the standard for film noirs. A dark, twisted and subtle film set in Hollywood.
Sunset Boulevard depicts a very refreshingly realistic view on Hollywood stars and the film industry. Although it is brutally honest, I fully appreciate that it brings the attention away from romanticizing Hollywood as it is often done in films we see today. This film successfully shows the point of view of a hustling screenplay writer and a forgotten actress.Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is a mentally ill, somewhat self-obsessed, retired and tragically forgotten Hollywood actress with an eccentric personality that intrigues the audience throughout the whole film. Norma carried us through the whole film only showing very small parts of her madness. Right at the end, when the timing was right, she drew the audience in with a full-blown meltdown. This was possibly my favorite scene - grand and bold. The audience had been waiting for her to crack fully and when she did, I was absolutely satisfied with the performance. Nancy Olson was okay, but boring. I wanted to like her but she was so mind-numbingly nice and much too dependent on a man then necessary. Joe Gillis was perfect for the role of the screenplay writer. Seemingly, a put together man yet he makes some questionable decisions that kept me guessing.The plot of Sunset Boulevard initially seems relatively simple but throughout the film, Billy Wilder adds in some subtle yet drastic twists. Technically speaking, it was beautifully shot. The cinematography is something I rarely focus on but in Sunset Boulevard it was phenomenal. In the mansion, the use of shadows portrayed the grunge look. The lighting was subtle and created a depth when appropriate.",Sunset Blvd.
484,elsajansson9,a disappointment,3,8 February 2015,"In my opinion Sunset Boulevard was a bland film that left me completely indifferent. The thing I disliked the most about this film was the character development. Joe along with the rest of the characters were two dimensional and flat. The acting by Gloria Swanson was distasteful and overdone which made the film more of a soup opera with an uninteresting story line. I had high expectations after watching Wilder's some like it hot but after watching Sunset Boulevard I was not impressed. In the films defense I am not a big film noir person, I would much rather watch a psychological thriller like Psycho or The Talented Mr Ripley. In conclusion the three words that would best describe this film would be obvious, long, and overdone. I definitely think this film is an acquired taste.",Sunset Blvd.
485,MilanElliott,A necessary movie to watch for all those who are interested in film.,9,27 February 2015,"""Sunset Boulevard"" truly is a must-watch film. Not only is it a classic but it is a genuinely great film. It may be hard for some to understand as it was released in 1950 but it is great nevertheless. It perfectly melds the noir genre with the general populous' interest in the stars. Unlike other movies at the time this film truly showed the dark side of Hollywood. The side filled with murder, affairs, and shady actions. It showcased how fame can mess with a person. Considering it was shot when it was it had some amazing angles. One of my favourites was the classic scene of Joe Gillis floating in the pool. This film also showcased a tremendous amount of symbolism. In almost every scene it was there it seemed. From Joe's chain getting caught on the gate to Norma Desmond getting hit by a boom microphone. It added a whole new layer. This was a very enjoyable film and although it was not one of my favourites, I am glad that I have seen it as it is referenced a lot in film today. It truly is a must-watch.",Sunset Blvd.
486,arpia97,Fascinating!,8,5 February 2015,"I actually didn't expect much from this movie when I started watching it. But this movie surprised me with its intense plot, and the allusions all over the movie. It used symbolic representation to the limit, and the characters all seemed original- I liked how all of these characters had individuality and how these characters kind of changed over time as the movie went on, as a result of inner and outer conflict. I also liked the complex plot of the movie, as well as how the story untied over time. The introduction had a pretty strong impression, and getting to know the behind story of it was very interesting for me. I thought using the imagery of old and young throughout the plot had a great influence in the progress of the story, both in the characters and the plot. Overall, I was very satisfied with this film. I thought the storyline was impressive- ahead of its time, and all the characters' acting was impressive.",Sunset Blvd.
487,chrisunderscoreroberts,Great film considering when it was made; taking account it was during the hays code and the year it was made (1950),6,16 February 2015,"I thought that Sunset Blvd. was very intriguing the way it was filmed and the was it was scripted. Personally, ""film noir style"" doesn't appeal to me very much but the character development and plot made it worth the while. Norma's crazy, huge ego minded personality set in the rustic mansion contrasted with Joe's low income, easily persuaded (by money) character along with his romance with Betty sustained my interest for sure. The film makers really hyperbolized each of the characters most prominent traits, such as Normas batty behavior and Betty's soft, aspiring personality. I think this type of scripting brought the film to life and made up for the lack of colour. (of course, colour wasn't possible at the time) What added to the film was the symbolism throughout, and the irony of Norma being played by Gloria Swanson, previous silent film star. Overall, I found the film was very well rounded in the sense that it wasn't just a love story, but a clever, witty, dark, and emotionally touching piece made in a time where this was very hard to find.",Sunset Blvd.

Not to say that it's not a good movie. The plot is extremely well written in my opinion. Norma Desmond, a silent film star trying to continue her career with the new sound films. This film gave me an idea of what the film business was like in the 1950's. It also makes me think and appreciate how far film has come today. Often I pass off a high speed chase or a battle scene in movie and forget how much time and effort has gone into it. Back to Sunset Blvd... The relationship between Norma and Joe is very interesting to watch unfold. Norma can't let go, and all Joe wants to do is be free from Norma and live his life the way he wants to. All in all,Sunset Blvd. is a well written film, but not my type of movie.",Sunset Blvd.

The symbolism throughout the film was intriguing, peaking my interest and keeping my attention on the screen. It was brilliantly done, and made the film what it was.

Since I'd heard it heralded as a classic, but didn't know much about it, I was excited to see it, and it was an interesting film to finally watch. However, I found it a little difficult to get invested in the film since neither of the main characters seemed particularly sympathetic to me.

And a couple of very interesting scenes. As a viewer I asked always myself what I would do , when I would be in the role of the screenwriter Joe Gilles.But at a interesting point around the end of the movie is where Betty Scheafer asks the screenwriter Joe to leave the silent movie actress Norma Desmond and to go with her, but Joe stays and so story becomes from a peaceful end (if he would go with Betty) to a very cruel and , when don't play attention to first movie scene, choking end, but I think the movie would be less interesting when it would end with the leaving of Joe with Betty . So I asked me too when Joe Gilles was so annoyed by Norma Desmond, why did he not just leave, why did he stay at this house with her so long, these are parts of the movie, which give the viewer really to think about it",Sunset Blvd.
495,mati_dipietro,Brilliant,9,12 January 2019,"Sunset boulevard was one of the most intricate movies that I have ever seen. It was brilliant and it showed flawed characters and how making certain types of choices reflects on how your life is going to be.
I didn't sympathize with any of the characters, I only had a slight preference for Betty, which was innocent, but too naive for my personal taste. I absolutely loved the expressiveness of Gloria Swanson (but since she was a famous silent movie actress I couldn't expect less than that). I am happy with the final: him not leaving when Betty asks him so is what males this movie ""realistic"".
We all hope love to triumph, justice to be made and the manipulators to lose, but in my opinion this movie wouldn't have been a classic if Joe had left with Betty. He made too many mistakes and lost his chances of saving himself, but instead he always preferred to keep living the way he was. At the end, his destiny was already sealed and deep down he knew what was gonna eventually happen.

Marshall Jr, decided to change this ongoing struggle, creating an absolute masterpiece that would soon change the film scene forever.The images of the black and white sceneries are quite fascinating and unforgettable. The beginning of this film noir is in my opinion, one of the greatest openers to a film of all time. As the eerie quiet piano music plays in the back, the creepy, sinister narration creates a whole world questioning what happened to this dead body laying in the pool. The open eyes of the writer stares right into your soul, as you are excited to see what's next, but also confused to see why this is the beginning of the movie. I think this style of film making is the best because for me, I tend to lose my train of thought and get bored with long movies, but like this film noir, and some Tarantino films. The scene at the beginning of this film just keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time.Sunset Blvd. is one of the finest Films ever made This has everything, dark humour, suspense, fantastic acting, flawless cinematography, and overall this is just a must-see for all movie lovers.",Sunset Blvd.

All other older movies I had seen had either been silent films, which significantly limits the depth of the story, or slapstick comedies which I am not the biggest fan of. surprisingly, it was a great story told in an interesting way. I loved it. This film must be one of the earlier examples of a movie starting from the ending scene, and then going back, slowly explaining how the story gets there. This movie definitely popularized this style of storytelling and set the stage for many movies to come.As far as I previously knew. Old movies in the Film Noir genre didn't have great stories, acting or cinematography.

499,jdmelhado,Sunset Blvd. Review by Juan,10,14 October 2020,"Sunset Blvd is an amazing film, with an incredible plot. This film teaches you so much about the influence fame can affect a person. This film has such an impact on the viewer. This film really keeps the viewer wanting to know what happens next. The plot twists are incredible and keeps you intrigued every second of the film. There wasn't a moment where i lost interest or didn't want to keep watching. Sunset Blvd is definitely a film because of the way it teaches you about the film industry back then and how people were treated. This film does a great job on showing how money isn't everything in life because of how William Holden lied to Norma Desmond about his life and who he was and his income. He did all this just for money and was very happy and thought all his problems had gone away but later in the movie he would find himself bored and unhappy even though he was very rich and had no financial problems. He then had an affair and was offered any amount of money but he left without any valuables or money and just wanted to go back to his old job and not be rich but be happy.",Sunset Blvd.
500,lucaj-33832,A Lovely Film Noir,8,14 October 2020,"I'm new to ""film noirs"". While i've most definitely seen a few, and liked them, I never knew it was a whole genre of movies. Sunset Blvd is one of the most classic film noirs as it was made in the 50's, and film noirs became popular only a few years prior (40s.) This movie really influenced all of film for the following years. I enjoyed this movie, but the backstory to it and all the little random things I learned about it while reading articles made me like it even more. For example, one of the main characters Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson who herself is a very well known silent film actress. It was her come back into the film word after many years and plenty movie opportunities offered to her. Knowing things like that about the movie (there are much more) make me more interested and impressed by the film.I liked this film a lot as its a heart-wrenching, soft yet intense story. It starts out with the classic film noir style.... A shot of main character Joe Gillis (played by William Holden) laying lifeless face down in a pool. It shocks you, and leaves you wanting more. I really enjoy this style of movie as I'm someone who has a very short attention span, meaning movies and films are sometimes hard for me to stay watching, but in this case I was intrigued a minute into the movie and stayed intrigued. I consider this production a film, as I can tell the creators of this movie made it with care and dedication, and not just to please the public. Also, this movie was way ahead of its time as I genuinely had no idea that it was made in the 50's until after the movie. It's incredibly well done for it's time, and gave a great example for the film industry. a lot of films and movies we know today wouldn't be the same without this film.If you consider yourself a film person... you need to watch this movie at least once.",Sunset Blvd.

After meeting with Norma desmond and Joe Gillis, story start to be different. Norma Desmond dream again that she comeback to stage. As much as the mind of dreams bigger, the obsession got bigger toward men who help her, and this led to the collapse of relationships and unfortunate events. impressive portion of this movie is when the movie was started, it show the scene the death of a man closely related to the ending. through this direction, i can more concentrated on story and infer what will follow myself. And also unique charcter and acting of actors are very well fit on the movie.",Sunset Blvd.
502,Fellani,Perfection,10,27 September 2001,"Usually, when I watch classics from the early part of the century, I can usually appreciate the historical values and innovations in those movies, but they don't usually blow me away like Sunset Boulevard did. I was speechless for most of the movie and the ending, although I knew about it, still amazed me.Everything is perfect in this movie: direction, script, scenario, photography and the acting. That movie and Double Indemnity really made me appreciate the genius of Billy Wilder.One of my top ten movies of all time.10/10",Sunset Blvd.
503,VHE,SWANSON'S FINAL CLOSE-UP,10,9 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Swanson and Holden, who plays the biographer of the former silent movie-star are sitting together when he asks her:"" You used to be pretty big?"" She immediately answers: ""I'm still big, it's the pictures that got small.""Wilder's best performance. He directs the dramatical story of disappointment. Swanson should have won an oscar. The fact that she didn't get it is the biggest screw-up in movie history. The same thing can be said about Downey Jr for 'Chaplin'. The fact she kills Holden in the final scene adds up to what the movie is all about. Everybody knows she's excentric and a fallen idol. The part I liked the most is Holden knocking at her door, and he's being mistaken by Von Stroheim, the butler, for a funeral aranger. Swanson's chimp died. A perfect beginning to a perfect film. A great classic, and although not very fast, it is still breathtaking and very realistic. An absolute A, one of the best films ever made, with an excellent performance by Holden and Von Stroheim.On a cold winter day, staring out of the window, I often think about this masterpiece, and wonder if Swanson plays a role or plays herself.",Sunset Blvd.
504,fercastro,The stuff nightmares are made of.,10,11 February 2002,"A wonderful,marvelous, out-of-this-world picture. It is crude with Hollywood, but it is also a declaration of love to the movies, and all that they represent. Gloria Swanson is at the top of her career as one of the most bigger-than-life characters of the movies. And William Holden delivers his best performance as the gigolo-to-be Gillis. But the movie belongs, ultimately, to Erich Von Stroheim, the master of his art that was the influence on Wilder here. Wilder said he had ideas of himself for the movie, such as a scene in which he would wash Norma Desmond's underwear with romantic frenzy. Talk about screen rebels...",Sunset Blvd.
505,giora77,Wonderful! Aged amazingly well.,10,17 May 2018,"What a wonderful and witty script, filled with cynicism and an immaculate set up of two characters-Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond-who are so different that they perfectly drive each other deeper into each other's hubris. The more I learned about the history of that time, and the wise allegory the film makes so ahead of its time, the more I appreciate this cinematic gem. It's hard to know where to begin. The larger than life settings are awesome in the true sense of the word: from the formidable and grotesque mansion (with more trinkets than those owned by the world's best hoarders), to the real film sets in Paramount Studios, and the humdrum writing office turned into a courting stage filled with spark and excitement. The acting is fantastic, and Gloria Swanson seems to have been born for this part-perhaps her creation of Norma was inspired by her own experience, being a silent film star herself.The intelligent plot and character development brings both Desmond and Gillis to self-destruct, and bury each other further in delusions, while staying entirely convincing throughout. The misery of both of them, and their consequent desperation and need for each other, makes the viewer even more engrossed in the picture and the inevitable fate of the two.There are not enough words to describe the magnificence and precociousness of this film-it simply needs to be experienced and taken in. How lucky to have been able to watch it on the big screen! Thank you TCM.",Sunset Blvd.
506,bassjim,An argument for black and white,10,26 December 2002,"There are three reasons why I love this movie: Billy Wilder, Gloria Swanson, and black and white photography.  Don't misunderstand me, I love the other actors (Holden is his usual solid self)in this film, but Swanson's performance has to be one of the small handful of all-time great performances by a leading actress (my other favorites are Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, Bette Davis in All About Eve, and Katherine Hepburn in The Lion In Winter).  Unfortunately for Swanson, All About Eve was released in the same year, so Swanson and Davis cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday stole the Oscar for Born Yesterday, one of the All-time Oscar travesties.  Swanson puts it all out there for us in this film, and we all get to just eat it up.  She's nothing short of mesmerizing in this film...just try not to pay attention to her and you'll see what an act of futility that is.Wilder?  Quite simply, he's my favorite director of all time, and this may well be his best work.  Eight Oscar nominations for Best Director! What's even more amazing is that he was nominated twelve (that's right, twelve) times for Best Screenplay!  How many contemporary directors also write their own work?  I don't mean to disparage modern directors; on the contrary, I don't expect directors to write the story as well as tell it, but that's what made Wilder so special.  His works include Some Like It Hot, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, The Apartment, Double Indemnity, and Witness For The Prosecution.  Counting Sunset Boulevard, Wilder has six films in imdb's Top 250, with none of those lower than 170.  That's one hell of a resume folks!Finally, the photography.  If anyone ever remakes this film, shame on them. Not only does this film HAVE to be in black and white, but it's just impossible to imagine improving on the way it is filmed.  Rarely have I watched a movie and gotten the creeps just from the atmosphere of an old house, but this film does it to me every time, and I've seen it several times!  For William Holden, this house becomes something of a prison, and just getting out of it means everything to him.  We the audience come to feel the same way.A great, great film, one of the best ever.  Check it out and enjoy!",Sunset Blvd.
507,zohreh_y,A beautiful movie directed by Billy Wilder,9,6 December 2014,"One of the most beautiful movies that I've ever seen is ""Sunset Boulevard"". It is a 1950 Billy Wilder's masterpiece with an all-star cast. This movie is about a silent-screen star, Norma Desmond, who lives in a mansion with her butter. Living in her own world, Norma cannot come to the term with the fact that she is not famous anymore. Her butter, who used to be her husband and director in the years of her reputation, also helps her to be in the illusion that she is still a famous actress by showing her photos that are asked to be signed by her. The stage of being self-absorbed and losing touch with reality is to the extent that even after being charged by the police because of murdering her beloved screenwriter, she still sees everything the way she likes as she makes a speech in front of the police about how happy she is to be in a film again, ending with ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up""",Sunset Blvd.
508,d-kristensen-115-52781,A classic masterpiece.,8,29 January 2015,"This film was excellent in most aspects. The actors and actresses did a great job of playing their roles, especially Gloria Swanson. I enjoyed how they revealed the protagonist's death right at the beginning of the movie and it leaves you wondering how he ended up that way throughout the entire viewing of the film. The fast-paced delivery of the lines really has the feel of an old classic movie. Symbolism was another good aspect in the way his gold chain gets caught on the door showing how Joe is trapped in Norma's life, as well as when Norma is bumped in the head with a microphone reminding her that her days of silent movie fame are over. Overall it was a great film and I would recommend it to anyone.",Sunset Blvd.
509,parkerg-g,A Cool Concept With Okay-Ish Excecution,7,14 February 2019,"I found Sunset Boulevard to be pretty alright, personally. There wasn't anything that I found particularly jumped out as wild or interesting, but that might just be my view from here in 2019. Back in the 50's when this was released, I'm sure it was a lot more nfluential and out of the box. It did a good job of the Film Noir style, with the main character not being the 'shiny perfect' guy, instead having flaws and not exactly being the most likeable. But all in all, there was nothing very memorable about it. The plot fell flat, and I didn't find myself caring about the characters as much as I should have.",Sunset Blvd.
510,JT-20,The best Hollywood movie about Hollywood.,10,12 September 1998,"I had two friends in college whose movie opinions I took seriously.  I asked them both which movie they thought was most ahead of its time.  One said Citizen Kane (predictable) and the other said Sneakers (laudable but borderline dubious).  My vote goes to Sunset Blvd.  This movie would eventually have been made, in another era of Hollywood -- even Altman was praised for The Player, but it was pretty much a metaphysical takeoff of Sunset Blvd.  And, honestly, who doesn't want to be William Holden?",Sunset Blvd.

In fact, it exceeded my greatest expectations by far.  It is so cool.  I found it to be fascinating.  The character of Norma Desmond is so kind of freaky it's interesting.

513,Jackson1floe,Sunset Blvd.,8,28 October 2020,This Movie was one of the most intresting and action packed black and white films I have even seen.

514,tamara-87849,Historically Significant but Modern Day Uncomfortable,7,15 November 2020,"Sunset Boulevard made me extremely uncomfortable, I will not lie. The film itself was pretty good, on the surface it could have passed as a movie even. It was easy to follow, the cinematography was pretty good, the soundtrack was fitting, it was overall well made. It was filmed as a movie, I would say, but it is a film. The cinematography may not have been super artsy, and the story may have been simple enough, but it still made me think. It made me wonder: about people, about history, about humanity, and that is what makes it a film. And sure, one could watch it and see it simply as a movie and still be entertained, but to watch it as a film I think is a different experience. To pay attention to the history being told, the historical perspective of the story and it's characters, the underlying human emotions that riddled the story... It makes a huge difference. But it still made me uncomfortable. Norma Desmond made me very uncomfortable as a character. She was desperate and unhinged and messy, and honestly, she was creepy. I didn't like her at all, which I would say means that Gloria Swanson did a fantastic job at making the character seem real. Her emotions were too much, her selfishness was believable and horrible to watch, her dramatics were cringeworthy and awful. I hated it, but I also can appreciate that it means the story was told well. When someone feels as much disdain towards (most of the characters) in this film as I did, then the storytelling is going well. As much as I found this film difficult to watch after a while, I have to say that I was intrigued to how it would end, and that's good when watching a film noir, because the end is the most important part. I think Sunset Boulevard set a strong precedent for the film noirs to follow it. I don't know much about the film noir genre, this is one of two film noirs I've seen in my life, but I have heard it is well known, well appreciated, and historically important for the film industry, and so I think whatever amazing films and stories came out of its existence were probably well worth the work it took to make it.",Sunset Blvd.
515,winstonc-86282,Did a good job at being unsettling,9,15 October 2020,"Sunset Boulevard had me internally yelling the entire way ""What are you doing?!"". I guess it was extremely unsettling to me to see Gillis becoming dependent on the riches of such a painfully fragile yet egotistical woman. To say the least, it was just uncomfortable to observe the path that Gillis was taking himself through - he had a much more promising future working with Schaffer. Yes, he may have been close to drowning in Desmond's wealth, and could (maybe) have a shot at potentially enhancing her mediocre scripts to fit the likings of the people at Paramount, thus earning him a (very) dependant living. But did he really want that? I don't particularly think so. I feel like he was almost accepting his ""fate"" with a sort of resentment. Because he felt like he didn't really have a choice, because he thought he had a shot with giving her reputation a face lift. Eventually I'm pretty sure he started to realize that he couldn't stay with this lady anymore, that he needed to turn his life around and go back, find his own friends his own age, working with people his own age.
I think Schaffer alluded to many opportunities and chances Gillis could take to work with her, such as when Gillis had enough of Desmond and decided back to his friend Green to inquire on whether or not Green could give him a few nights at his place. Then he was subsequently informed by Schaefer that she believed one of his scripts had potential - and was almost abruptly turned down in return when he declined. Or when Mayerling divulged to him the nearly unfathomable fact that it was in fact he who was really writing and sending the fan mail to Desmond. Because clearly no one found much taste in her work anymore. And her fame was vanishing. Fast.
I feel like the entire time he was almost battling an inner doubt within him - to find wealth and work with a seemingly crazed older lady with a fragile ego, or sign a deal with Schaffer who comprehended that his work had potential. I feel like he was in a way not really sure what he was getting himself into in the first place - he was $300 in debt, no one would lend him anything, and he started to develop mutual relations with this old woman. The ending was almost scary to me. He completely lost his chances with Schaffer. It was like his double life was seriously messing with his thinking too. The second Desmond revealed the firearm, I was 99.9% sure he wasn't leaving the estate alive (the 0.01% I was reserving for a miracle. I mean, you never know with this woman who seemed dazed to the point of becoming schizophrenic-like at the final ending shot). Somehow when she was following him with the gun I still hadn't connected the dots to the shot at the start with the dead body in the pool. But then, yes - it all made sense in a landslide.
Overall, if the film was meant to be perceived as unsatisfying/settling to their primary audiences, well it worked for me.",Sunset Blvd.
516,Rikuisu,Story-within-story,5,26 March 2003,"Insufferable in some respects, although perhaps purposefully so. The story dragged on and on though the ego-trip of a silent actress who is struggling to be revived in the industry. Norma Desmond's infatuation with herself and total reliance on being 'known' is part of why I struggled so much through the film. If anything, I sympathized for Joe, forced to live with this person who expected everything to be as she imagined. What makes this film interesting is the story-within-story of the decline of the silent movie actor juxtaposed against a silent era actress acting as the silent actress in decline. The cast is full of silent actors, including Norma, and directors. Even the gossip at the end of the movie was a actor-turned-gossip in truth. Perhaps it had been a stretch for Mrs. Swanson to accept this role. I can't imagine that very many silent-era actors enjoyed the advent of 'talkies'. (possible spoiler:) Also, having the whole story told by a dead man is an interesting take on things. For all that he was murdered, he gave a rather kind story to the one who killed him.",Sunset Blvd.

While avoiding the repo man Jo make a left turn into a situation he will never forget.  The driveway he turns into is none other than the famous silent screen diva Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives in an amazing decrepit Hollywood mansion. Norma Desmond is a once famous movie star who is having problems facing the reality that stardom is no longer part of her life. Norma has been working on a script for a movie that would star her as the lead character propelling her back into her superstar status. Norma hires Jo to refine the script housing him conveniently above the garage. Jo being broke cannot refuse the offer. When water damage forces Jo to move into the main house Jo becomes more tangled in the web of the temptress Norma.  Jo becomes a kept man receiving expensive clothes and trinkets from Norma and loses touch with his life as a budding screenwriter. Opportunities for romance are faltered by the meldding Norma with Jo getting fed up with it all wanting to return to Ohio but he does not make it. Norma gets her final close-up from the news reporters who engulf her mansion to capture footage of the once famous movie star turned murderer.The film begins with Jo doing a dead mans float literally, reflecting on what went wrong with his interactions with Norma Desmond. This film is classified as a Film Noir and Gloria Swanson's performance creates an eerie feeling anywhere in or around her mansion that complements her creepy character. The audience can tell Gloria's character has a few screws loose and the anticipation for something bad to happen is apparent throughout the film especially because you know Jo is killed at one point in the film.One of the things I liked the most about this film is the gaudy limo that Norma and Jo are driven around in by Max (Erich Von Stroheim) the butler. The limo is an imported hand made monstrosity that has leopard skin seats. Norma and Jo are driven around like royalty in this limo while people are pointing and laughing at the sheer site of the limo. The funny thing about Max the butler is that he is the director that found Norma as an actress and has accepted a menial job just to be around her.  Max is really creepy and seems to being always lurking around the mansion observing what is going on. Some significant facts about this film are for one the film deviated from the classical Hollywood mold of film making while pointing out what happens to stars that are no longer wanted by film makers and the movie viewing public exemplifying the myth of the Hollywood life. Norma Desmond is a delusional actress that has been used up and no longer needed by the Hollywood film makers. Hollywood did not like the way this idea was portrayed and only time could give the credit due for this film. Gloria Swanson was actually a silent movie start in the 20's and was making a comeback starring in Sunset Blvd. The friends that come to play bridge with Gloria's character were also silent film stars. The butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) was actually a prominent silent film director.",Sunset Blvd.

Joe agrees to review a terrible script that the diva is writing, dreaming of a sensational return to the set. The atmosphere of the house is black, dark, almost deadly. The diva projects continually her old movies, guests are mummies, this fact proves that she is obsessed with herself and her career. Relevant figure is the domestic Von Mayerling (Stroheim), he is also the first husband of Norma. She ends up falling in love of the young man, but Joe is in love with his colleague Olson. Gillis for a while accepts the situation but then he starts to be worried and afraid. But Norma, now mad and out of her mind, shoots him while he is leaving. Man falls into the pool, a symbol of the things he had so desired. Norma became mad because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she is not a star anymore, she doesn't want to accept that she is old and not anymore young and beautiful: during the film she tries to look younger thanks to clamorous long beauty treatments; she doesn't want to open her eyes and she doesn't want to see the truth. The story is told by Gillis, who is already dead, in the third person in a long flashback. Everything in the film is dusty, old, broken and decadent. The tragic music and the colors of the pictures help raising the effectiveness of the story. Everything is specifically about the world of the cinema: the dialogs, the life of the cinema studies, even the legendary gate of Paramount.

The narration helped make the film feel like a crime movie throughout the film. The cinematography through the film was good. The slow montage that was used to show the title of the film was suspenseful and dramatic. There are many uses of scenes fading in and out of the bedroom scene as the screenwriter is alone writing the actress' screenplay. The acting in this film was played out well, although sometimes overreacted.The movie kept up its suspense and drama through its great acting, lighting, mood, narration, and music that made the movie good.

And yet, man, what a draining film.I could go on and on, but I'll keep my review covering just the most salient points. Perhaps the most important of these is that the movie explores the concept of wealth combined with loneliness better than any other I've seen to date. Norma's desperate cries, the large house they live in, the strange things that seem to always be happening; I think whenever I think of the combination of wealth and loneliness again in the future, Norma Desmond is the character I will have in my mind. This is one of the great movies about Hollywood. Even if you're not interested in that stuff though, you'll still find something to your liking here. Just watch it.",Sunset Blvd.

Gloria Swanson perfomance was just brilliant and amazing without her the movie probably wouldn't be the same, but my favorite character is Max, he's such an interesting character.

In my opinion: No. Sure, the film would have been good nonetheless, because of its many small details, also because of plot twists like Max being Norma's first husband. All of those features would have made that a generally good film, but I still think that it wouldn't be the classic it is today if it weren't for the ending, because the ending plays a big part in making this film extraordinary. If Joe would have left with Betty, this would have been a good romance, but nothing more. It would have been too predictable and mediocre.

She will convince Joe to help her, however with time he will realize that she ""imprisoned"" him in that house anche he will try to ""escape"" lieing to her.A central character throughout the movie il Betty.

Almost at the end Joe will have to chose between Betty and Norma: Betty offers him to go away together, but Joe refuses deciding to live with none of the two.
This decision will cost to Joe his own life, as Norma kills him in order to stop him from leaving her.
It would have been easy to make Joe go away with Betty and so give a food ending to this masterpiece. So why it didn't happen?
Going away with Betty to live with her would have meant that Joe didn't grow from all the experiences he lived and so all the development that the character undergoes throughout the movie would have been wasted.Just after watching the movie and analysing it you understand why so many people love it and why it is still appreciated nowadays.",Sunset Blvd.

He would eventually become crazy, too. Now that would be great! Gloria Swanson's 'eager-for-attention' acting is nice, but maybe somewhat overacted. Cinematography is beautiful, though.

530,Sara_Golfarbs_fate,A very brave look at Hollywood when Hollywood was bullied by an absurd censorship.,10,2 August 2003,"Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day. Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.This is not the case here. Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood. It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot, on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is top-notch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject, especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently, the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest film-noir of all time. I don't think it is a film-noir at all. For some aspects, the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white German-expressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity', femme-fatale but these two are not enough to make a film-noir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horror(the end is horrifying for me) and with some very very dark comedy.Overall, This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see. 10/10",Sunset Blvd.
531,abel_posadas,DEFINITE STORY ON Hollywood BROKEN DREAMS,9,4 June 2004,"Billy Wilder and Charles Bracket got the definite ghost story about Hollywood broken dreams. There's something vicious about the place and, on the other hand, this movie means the end of an era: Hollywood up to 1950. That year means, in my opinion, the last curtain for the so-called dream factory. And in that dream Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis become crazy. She becomes a fiend and he a pimp. The horror is that after 1950 Hollywood would never be the same and we can say that it's the end of the modern era and the beginning of postmodernism -what with the idiocy of the 50's era-? ABEL POSADAS",Sunset Blvd.
532,mrsinks65,Classic,10,7 July 2013,"Delicious film noir that EVERY movie buff should see or own! Wonderful camp acting and great sets and lighting tricks. One of my personal favorites!! Gloria Swanson is super creepy, yet tragic as she tells William Holden her tales of woe while falling in love (or is it infatuation) with him. She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him. Watch for a tour d France delicious romp into Hollywood history both woven into the story of tragedy, hope, and strange mystery. Watch for a great performance by Max, Nora Desmonds butler. This movie is a classic that has uncommon staying power even by todays standards. William Holden is fun and OH SO YOUNG!",Sunset Blvd.
533,crizrocks,Dark face of Hollywood. Greatest depiction. One of the best ever.,10,4 April 2014,"This is the first film noir and one i ever saw. At first i was hoping for something very dark and mysterious, and it was at the beginning. Death of a man in a swimming pool and how he got there is pretty much the outline of the film. But this is not a mystery solving movie too. The movie portrays the life of an aging lonely yesterdays star, who is waiting to make a comeback or in her words ""a return"". Added to this is a not so successful writer who gets stuck with her and her wild fantasies of making a movie with her own script which shows nothing more than her face. She lives a life where she fails to realize that she is long forgotten and so are silent films. The movie basically explores how fame and deception can change the life of any person and how hard it can be to realize the truth. It also depicts how charming hiding from troubles of real life for luxuries can get until it takes away freedom. Also it features the dark face of Hollywood.The performance by the actors are terrific. The screenplay is brilliant, and the score makes the seemingly slow movie a wonderful experience.If it wasn't for All About Eve, the movie would definitely won the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. Do not miss one of the greatest Hollywood Black Cinema.",Sunset Blvd.
534,mattyankster10,Outstanding script along with excellent acting,9,15 August 2015,"Before I watched Sunset Blvd I knew it was an old 1950's classic in black and white, and I was slightly reluctant to put it on only because I was feeling a bit tired and wasn't sure if I was in the mood for something that required deep attention. But I was wrong, Sunset Blvd was actually a very easy to watch movie, it did not have an overly complicated plot. As soon as the movie began my eyes were glued to the television and my brain easily absorbed every single detail of the plot. What I also liked about it was that they kept it to a nice length, only 1 hour 50 minutes long. A similar film that I recently watched is All About Eve, which ran for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I felt that was a bit too long and they dragged out much longer than they should have. Sunset Blvd went by at a much more pleasant pace. In other words there was never a moment in which I zoned out. The characters in it were unique and intriguing. But what I liked most of all about the film was the screenplay, which is slightly ironic given that the film is from the point of view of a screenwriter. The one liners that the characters come out with are so artistically, smooth and poetic. This type of film writing is an art that has been lost in todays making of pictures. The acting performances was some of the best I've witnessed in a while, especially from Gloria Swanson. How she didn't win an Oscar for it I do not know. One thing I will say is that if you're not a fan of old fashioned films in general then you may not enjoy it because after all the film is in black and white and was made in the early 1950's. But you never know Sunset Blvd could be the exception.",Sunset Blvd.

She lives in a fantasy world. Erich Von Stroheim plays a very attentive butler; he was previously married to Swanson in days gone by. I really like how the movie starts with the dead body of Holden and backtracks the rest of the way. It's very eerie that Holden is narrating his own murder, as well as the rest of the movie. This is one of the very best movies I've ever seen! It's the kind of movie that I heard of long before I viewed it and, once seeing it, wondered why I had avoided it so long.",Sunset Blvd.
536,billywilder,The Best Movie of the Best Movie's Director of all time!,10,15 February 1999,"Forget ""Citizen Kane""! Forget ""Casablanca""! Forget ""The Godfathers""! Forget all the John Ford's westerns! Besides, forget all that theory-of-montage-invented-by-Eisenstein stuff. The true genius of cinema has a name: BILLY WILDER. And ""Sunset Boulevard"" is his best film. Not of him, in fact, but of all time. It's a disgrace that he has lost the Academy Award for ""All About Eve"" - another great movie - but this became another of the countless injustices of the Oscar's history. There is not any other movie director that can show a filmopgrafhy as the one Billy Wilder. The 40's and specially the 50's was a example of masterpieces, one after another. Of course, I admit that he didn't maintain the same level after this time. ""The Apartment"" was its last great movie, in spite of him to have made great works after this, as the overlooked ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Fedora"" - almost a ""Sunset Boulevard"" re-make. But ""Sunset Boulevard"", reviews today, it stays with its qualities, witty, intelligence, cynicism. It's the screenplay - perhaps Casablanca also deserves this honor - it is that possesses more brilliant sentences, that until today we know by heart. It's my film number one, in any list of best movies of all the times!",Sunset Blvd.

I have spent my life missing what has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.The acting was superb, the storyline riveting and the characters were people you could care about. Max was my personal favorite. There was a quiet, tragic dignity to him. I expected something to be revealed about him but was not prepared for the truth.I've always liked William Holden but my experience with Gloria Swanson was limited to her brief role in ""Airport 75"". I will now look for more movies by her. What an expressive face.It was fun to try to recognize some of the old time actors that were portraying themselves. An all around excellent movie.

There may be an occasional movie like SHASHANK REDEMPTION or SHINING.... but I feel the ratio in quality is 50:1 BETWEEN B/W AND COLOUR movies. Thanks to CHAPLIN,ORSON WELLES,HITCHCOCK,JOHN FORD etc...the best of movies have already been produced.Now coming to SUNSET BLVD the movie is so much entertaining with wonderful performances of 4/5 actors,stylish presentation and touches our heart in several scenes.

It is so stereotypical of how the media views washed up celebrities. I do not understand how this film is rated so high. It is a decent movie (a borderline good movie) I should say but the story, plot, and directing is uninspired and unimaginative compared to the other films rated high on the lists of film critics. My review of this movie may be a little off though as a mere 24 hours earlier I had watched zoolander for the 3rd time. Which by the way brings me to another point. This movie takes itself way too seriously. Its hard to take someone seriously if that person is too serious himself.",Sunset Blvd.

Gloria Swanson was brilliant, and probably because she could really relate to her character. She grew up acting in silent films like her character, and she did a fantastic job. William Holden is brilliant, and the first scene we see him in truly set the pace for the film. It is a film, that many may not know, inspired future generations. Maybe even actors and directors who have never seen this are using some of the same techniques used in this film. It is a classic, and I truly hope Meryl does play in this remake. It would be excellent, and I could only see her or a few other elite actresses playing the role. I don't know who they would get for William Holden's part.

I'll agree that the begining was interesting and I liked the ending but don't tell me that the whole ending wasn't predictable.  I knew exactly how it would end with half an hour left.  Although G. Swanson was perfect at her part, just her performance didn't make it a good movie.

Billy Wilder is a superb director and William Holden a terrific actor. And the plot. Very good indeed. As a whole the movie is a perfect combination. Actors, screenplay, music and all key elements are all very close to the best I've ever seen on film. I can on only wonder about the imagination of Billy Wilder. Of course I have give credit to the other writer Charles Brackett as well. And Gloria Swanson plays the neurotic and psychotic has-been movie star with so much authenticity that it is quite scary. What more can I say? Probably quite a lot, but I'll just end by saying that Sunset Blvd. is in my opinion one of the greatest movies ever.",Sunset Blvd.
547,coolcalm02,Billy Wilder's Best and a total Classic,10,17 February 2014,"It's uncanny how modern so many of Billy Wilder's movies are. That's one of the things that makes him one of the greatest directors in history. His films almost never seem dated. And this masterpiece is still a wonderful example, about a struggling, broke Hollywood screen writing wannabe who jumps at the chance of making money shacking up with a washed-up and aging silent-movie actress and writing her terrible comeback script. The story goes into bizarre and sexually-uncomfortable territory when he realizes that he has become her kept sugar baby and boy-toy.There is one element that feels VERY dated, and that is the spectacular performance by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but it's supposed to feel dated! In one of the greatest performances of all time, here's a woman completely stuck in the past and in her now fading stardom, struggling to reclaim her past glory. It's fascinating the similarities between Norma and the Gloria, who at the time was also a silent movie actress who lost popularity. Even the silent movie Norma watches near the beginning is a real one starring Gloria Swanson!This movie works in every way and is a timeless classic.",Sunset Blvd.

549,cara-isabella4,"An exquisitely creepy, and alluring portrayal of '50s Hollywood. Must see.",9,18 May 2015,"Sunset Blvd.'s appeal lies in its exquisitely creepy and alluring portrayal of '50s Hollywood. Its timelessness and ability to retain relevance more than sixty years after its release is especially ironic considering the plight of its lead, the eccentric faded silent-film star, Norma who despite her desperate and obsessive attempts to cling to her former stardom, remains obsolete. The unique ambiguity between reality and fiction achieved via the casting choices adds depth and allows for audiences to look past the illusion of the glitz and magic of the industry and witness a story of failure that was, at the time, uncharacteristic to the typical film climate of Hollywood escapist pictures. The mordant wit and lavish, Gothic set design are aspects that add to the overall tone of this gorgeously grotesque classic. Both Norma and Gillis are outsiders, teetering on the edge of obscurity, caught in the claw-like grip of hopeless need and desire to make it in the industry. Wilder's film captures the callous nature of the studio system, through the narrative of Gillis and the investigation surrounding his mysterious murder. MGM executive, Louis B. Mayer's reported disgust at this film had much to do with the belief that the movie was a disgrace to Hollywood. Sunset Blvd.'s portrayal of Norma was terribly offensive to the industry, which ""relied heavily on the power of illusion"" (Culbertson 2006). Mayer's revulsion must only have been magnified as the film went on to win three Oscars and an enduring place in Hollywood history.",Sunset Blvd.
550,thomasmonsma,In the spotlight,10,27 February 2015,"What a film. Written and directed by Billy Wilder, this film encapsulates the mania of Hollywood through three characters. This film is fantastic for how well it has aged, not at all like Norma Desmond - still true to it's themes of obsession and self-image. Time for my close-up, DeMill!In this story we're introduced to hack screenwriter Joe Gillis. With only a few B movies to his name, he struggles to put out scripts from his Hollywood apartment. Being chased down by the insurance company for late car payments, he decides to hide his car in the worst possible house he could've found in the hills, the house of Norma Desmond.A great film about film-making, this is one of Billy Wilder's best. It makes satire of the business of Hollywood tying an intriguing plot, bittersweet, funny, and reminiscent of an era. Dealing with many intra-personal problems, you will find either great comedy withing this film or great drama. This film is fantastic, and if you haven't seen it, you're doing yourself a great disservice.",Sunset Blvd.
551,mcquadeconnor96,short honest Sunset Boulevard,8,27 February 2015,Sunset Boulevard is a really good film given the fact that it was made almost 70 years ago. And the commentary on Hollywood is still right on. Sunset Boulevard is a timeless classic and a prime example of Noir films. It's well written and on par with any other film that's made now. The only thing wrong with this film is that at some points due to the amazing writing it seems scripted. At some points the things that the characters are saying just seem so impossible to make on the spot. Gloria Swansons acting in the film was really the heart of it and was outstanding. One of the reasons possibly her portrayal of the character Norma Desmond was so good was because the fictional character and her own life were in fact very similar.,Sunset Blvd.

It is crude with Hollywood, but it is also a declaration of love to the movies, and all that they represent. Gloria Swanson is at the top of her career as one of the bigger-than-life characters of the movies. Usually, when I watch classics from the early part of the century, I can usually appreciate the historical values and innovations in those movies, but they don't usually blow me away like Sunset Boulevard did. I was speechless for most of the movie and the ending, although I knew about it, still amazed me. There are some humorous moments like who the coffin was for in the beginning. William Holden played the Joe Gillis role. Erich Von Stroheim played butler, Max and sweet Nancy Olson played Betty Schaefer.Overall I liked this movie and considering the age it is a timeless classic",Sunset Blvd.

555,maddiethatsme,The GREATEST film of all!!!!!!,10,20 February 2018,"My favorite film of all time. Everything about this film is amazing in my opinion. It really is almost like a horror film. It shows Hollywoods weaker side and what it does to people like Norma Desmond, they make them stars, and once they get older, they throw them away as if there not needed. But it also takes slaps at writers, studios, film writers, and even directors. Wonderful script, and is masterfully filmed in black in white by Billy Wilder. The acting is absolutely amazing, everyone at their best! William Holden is wonderful in his role. You see all of his emotions very well throughout the film, when he's angry, when he feels sorry for Norma, and the helplessness on his face when he finds out Norma is madly in love with him, and he can't do anything. Max I thought was great too, but his character is quite sad, giving up his whole career of directing to take care of Norma and having to lie to her constantly, telling her she is ""The greatest star of them all"" and its almost like he's making it even worse. Now, Gloria freaking Swanson is just magnificent!!!!!!!!!! Everything, I mean everything about her acting in this film is spot on and incredible. When she loses it finally, it's almost like your losing it too. It's frightening almost. There's so much to discuss, I could go on and no. I can't think of any other film that is as monumental and amazing as this work of art. Gloria Swanson gives the best performence by an actress in movie history!

556,nghtwlkr109,The Sunset Blvd/Scared To Death connection!,9,16 March 2006,"Although I would certainly agree that this is one of ""Hollywood's finest"", a true classic, etc., I have to take issue with people who comment on the uniqueness of the script, particularly in having the film being narrated by a corpse. One comment on this site even claims that this may be the first time such a device was used in films.NOT SO! In 1947, three years before this film's release, a low-budget independent film called ""Scared To Death"" beat Wilder to it. The film is narrated by the corpse of a young woman lying in a morgue who has been literally ""Scared to Death"" (hence the title). The picture stars Bela Lugosi & George Zucco (not to mention Nat Pendleton!) This is even more interesting when one considers that Wilder originally wanted SB to open with a scene of recently deceased corpses gathered in a morgue discussing their deaths! I must confess that I have a little suspicion, or fantasy if you will, as to how Wilder arrived at his vision for the opening sequence. After indulging in his little known (until now!) fetish for low-budget horror films (possibly the result of associating with his brother, W. Lee), I believe Wilder was on his way home from the theater musing on what he had just seen when the thought came to him: ""Nobody who sees my movies is likely to see THIS! If these guys think opening the movie with narration by one corpse is something, I'll open one with a whole roomful!"" Only the killjoys at Paramount Studios prevented Wilder's vision from reaching the screen as he originally intended. Admittedly the scene which ultimately did open the movie is at least equally bizarre and imaginative, as well as being breathtakingly shot.Is there something to the Scared To Death/Sunset Blvd connection? The world may never know! But I have my suspicions...",Sunset Blvd.
557,Ellen-4,Simply the Best,10,8 October 2007,"We just returned from Europe and ""Sunset Blvd"" was playing on the airline's Classic Movie Channel. I watched the whole thing twice, after having watched it dozens of times over the years. I was struck again by just how timeless this film is, in every way. Every aspect is perfect--the dialogue, the casting, the cinematography, the costumes & set, the soundtrack, and of course the brilliant acting & directing.Others in this comment section have written wonderful plot summaries and spoken to technical features so I won't repeat. I will point out just two things that I noticed: 1) When Swanson visits DeMille at Paramount, and he tells her to sit in his chair and watch for a bit, she is almost hit in the head by, of all things, a microphone on a boom. Annoyed, she pushes it firmly out of the way and out of the screen. Just priceless! What an inspired bit of symbolic ""business""; it so beautifully, almost subliminally, underlines her feelings about how the movies have disintegrated into ""talk, talk, talk"". 2) In the final scene, when Swanson is descending the staircase, the figures of the spectators are arranged just as carefully as those on a bas-relief frieze over a Roman temple. The composition is stunning! Even as the camera follows Swanson down the stairs, she passes people in poses just as static and stylized as statues. Another example of inspired juxtaposition of old and new--true genius at work. I wonder how many arrangements of people Wilder considered, and discarded, before he came up with this very specific one.An incredible achievement in every way, even more amazing considering the year it was made. God bless everyone who labored to preserve this film for the rest of us. Thank you, Billy Wilder.",Sunset Blvd.

My friends and I are in a little debate as to whether or not Norma and Joe actually slept together. I think that it is a little ambiguous. One friend says that she doesn't think that they did.

I don't recall seeing anyone overact the way she did in this movie. Every word seemed to be the most important word ever spoken. How she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Roll for this movie is beyond me. I think many actresses from that time period, including Joan Crawford, could have done a much better job.Holden, as an actor and narrator, did a great job as usual. I also thought the movie was a little too long. And Erich Von Stroheim, nominated for Best Supporting Actor also did a good job.",Sunset Blvd.
565,zedfest,Aging Silent film Star Falls for a Struggling Screenwriter,9,20 August 2014,"The dialogue is close to perfect. All the characters seem like real people full of yearning and angst Billy Wilder made many movies but this has got to be one of his best because of the darkness he paints in the film. Everyone in the film is engaging and you feel empathy even for people that normally you would consider a villain. Because there aren't any villains in this film just life. Everyone ages, everyone looses money,everyone falls in love with the wrong people at the wrong time. Great Writing , Great Acting, Great Costumes, and Great Director Billy Wilder. A must see for any true movie fan. ~ Wendy -ZED FEST FILM FESTIVAL",Sunset Blvd.
566,fiammamazzocchialemanni,"Hollywood, glorious Hollywood",10,5 March 2017,"If ever there was a film to watch before the end of times, 'Sunset Boulevard' would get my vote. Is it the impeccable depiction of a new world rising and the old one of silent films dying? Is it the sheer decadence and charisma of Gloria Swanson? Or the perfect script and first scene of the film? All those elements make this a glorious affair but there's much more to it, and if you only needed one reason: the last scene would be a perfect example. They say pictures are worth a thousand words, and that's never been more true. So yes to 'Sunset Boulevard', and to the indescribable beauty of decadence!",Sunset Blvd.
567,rprocter28,Great look at Hollywood,9,22 February 2012,"Wealthy, silent film superstar ""Norma Desmond""(Swanson), 50, was cast aside by Hollywood when she neared 30. She revels in her superstar status, delusional that it still exists; she's maintained in her mansion and these delusions of returning to public adulation and screen glory by her former film director (& former husband), now her butler-chauffeur (von Stroheim). The path of a broke, struggling B-film screenwriter ""Joe Gillis"" (Holden) enters Norma's territory and he becomes, for a time, her kept man, helping maintain her obsession of recapturing her superstardom. When he attempts to leave, this unhinges Norma more and she kills him. (NOTE: this is NOT a ""spoiler"" since the movie opens with Joe's dead body and his narrative voice-over.)This, one of the greatest of all Billy Wilder great films, was made only 22 years after the advent of ""talkies"" replacing silent films. It was THE first film to take a critical look at how Hollywood operated, especially in treating its former stars--& most especially young women--who were typically cast aside when they they lost their late teens/early twenties aura and glow. Film buffs will love the many inner details of this film: e.g., von Stroheim was actually Swanson's director in making the film which he (as butler) runs for the 2 leads to see. Swanson's imitation of Chaplin's Tramp is precious. With the later ""Singing in the Rain"" and now with ""The Artist,"" this was the first of (IMO) the 3 most significant films dealing with the drastic effects on so many people of the transition from silents to talkies. (Wilder's less than glowing look at then traditional Hollywood has been hailed as a breakthrough and a first, because--before that--Hollywood had to be glorified in films.)My rating: is 10 of 10 bearing in mind film history and 8.5/10 without that mindset; compromised at 9.",Sunset Blvd.
568,books6040,Great movie,10,12 July 2014,"This movie was absolutely amazing. I used to think that Casablanca was one of the best movies ever created, but now this one takes top spot. The acting is sensational, and the story is extremely riveting, making you sit up and watch. Gloria Swanson really gives her best performance in this role playing the actress who lives everyday just waiting for one more chance to be in front of the cameras again and to feel young. William Holden delivers a stellar performance, worthy of an academy award. If this movie was ever to be remade by Hollywood, which like Casablanca I hope it never does, there are only two actors who can play the titular roles, Helena Bonham Carter as Norma & Leonardo DiCaprio as Gillis, the rest will unfold as a movie so great it would be the movie of the century.",Sunset Blvd.
569,frizzi_2,Una mezcla de géneros por excelencia,9,28 July 2014,"Sunset Boulevard, The Twilight of the Gods, The Vanishing star. A mix of genres remains to perfection, this film seems be a film-noir classic, yet is comedy, drama, thriller psychological, horror, mystery and a touch of romance; go is the managed to make a film with a mixture of everything and died in the attempt. The highlight of it is its narrative structure, the whole story is told by a dead, which can also make this film one horror, also has elements like parlor organ and abandoned mansion. The plot revolves around Norma Deschmund an old movie actress mute who has not passed their glory years are over. this super entertaining and full of emotions. It has a high cultural level what which makes it also very smart, brilliant, perfect. The narrator is a young writer who has as relate to the mature ex-actress and a result. Recommended. Rating: 90/100",Sunset Blvd.
570,cfwoodsIV,"The Best movie I've ever seen, and I've seen them all!",10,27 May 2005,"Never has there been a movie made with more passion. It was just made in the wrong year (1950, or it would have won every Oscar and other award. (Too bad All About Eve) William Holden has never been more valiant and Gloria Swanson is beautifully cast as the aging actress. And has there been anyone as creepy as Erich Von Stroheim in a movie since? The answer is no! It is brilliant because it adds suspense, love, hate, allusion, and foreshadowing all together in less than two hours. I just wish that there were still movies made like this gem today. There are, of course, great movies still being made (Mostly by Scorsese and Eastwood), but this classic is will forever be one of the greatest ever filmed!",Sunset Blvd.
571,dmou-73-495317,A Standout Movie,9,6 August 2014,"Yes, Gloria Swanson's acting is slightly over the top in this drama however, for this movie it works! The reason why it works is because her character ""Norma Desmond"" a once famous silent screen actress from yester-year is stuck in the days gone by when actresses didn't need words because they had (what she refers to as)""Faces"" and every expression was over dramatized on film to get the story across to the viewer. However, these over theatrics and acts of grandeur is something she carried into her real life... which seems fitting when you take into account this is a woman who thinks of herself as larger than life.Not only has Norma refused to accept that the now popular ""Talkies"" has taken over the movie industry but, she also still has it in her head that she was and still is the greatest actress that ever was...... In her mind,time hasn't really passed by or, passed her by because she's ""Still big. It's the movies that got small"".Swanson is marvelous as a woman who is obviously delusional and to make matters worst... mentally unstable. William Holden is perfect as the down-on-his luck Hollywood writer who had the misfortune to form a bond with the great Norma Desmond and Erich Von Stroheim is wonderful as Norma's faithful servant. If I have wish about this movie..... It would be to learn more on how his character ""Max"" became her servant.This is a classic movie that I never tire of watching every couple of years.",Sunset Blvd.

573,dxceit,Such a smart film!,10,22 August 2017,"This film is an explorative and fascinating study regarding the human psyche! The direction, script, and acting are all first rate. The script is extremely honest - and so ahead of its time. I've watched this film time and time again and always learn something new. A great lesson on human value, boundaries, greed, ego, and delusion. There are many twists and turn. You won't be sorry you watched it. A must see. I will keep you thinking.",Sunset Blvd.
574,bluelfsuma,Ridiculous,4,11 April 2018,"I watched this in my Film Study class, so I'm not exactly an esteemed critic who's known for being really smart when it comes to movies. But, as an audience member, I can easily say that this has aged horribly. At the time, I'm sure it was dark and very eye-opening. But, by modern-day standards, it is a comedy, to be sure. In the beginning of the film, we see the main character dead, and narrating it. Getting to know this character was torture. I had no care for him and wanted him to die. Then, when he finally did, it was the most comical send-off. The way he died was so unrealistic, I just bursted with laughter. Then, the part where the crazy actress says ""I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille."" was when I realized I had watched something desperately trying to convince me it was good. This got 4 stars because it's funny.",Sunset Blvd.
575,ramazini-76390,It's an OK thriller.,6,22 September 2018,"With all those annoying superheroes flicks being released on a daily basis, I have decided to explore some classic material. Arbitrarily, I decided exploring the 50's. So far, I am loving it. So many cool stories and talented actors. I am glad to have decided doing it. My favorite one so far has been Bette Davis' ""All About Eve"". Such a cool movie in many ways. About Sunset Blvd, i was also very pleased. However, I honestly expected more from it. It's not that It didn't live up to my expectations. Acting was nice, in general. Plot a little predictable, but well constructed. I think my problem was that maybe i just didn't like Mister Holden that much. I just didn't find him charismatic enough. Anyway, it was a cool movie, but definitely not an 8.5 (maybe a solid 7).",Sunset Blvd.
