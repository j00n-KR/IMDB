0,SnoopyStyle,over a cliff,5,27 May 2020,"Tim Morris (David Spade) has a terrible blind date with the outrageous Melissa ""Missy"" (Lauren Lapkus). Later, he has a perfect first encounter with the former beauty queen Melissa Doherty (Molly Sims). He exchanges texts and invites her to a company retreat. He is shocked when the wrong Missy shows up and realizes that he's been texting the wrong person.First, what's wrong with Spade's hair? I'm sure that they think it makes him look more wimpish and less aggressive. I rather he just get a regular haircut and deliver the character with acting. I don't like this look. Sandler has his posse and they seem to think that annoying characters are automatically funny. I normally like Lapkus but here, she is pushing the character literally off a cliff. She just needs to pull some of it back. She doesn't need to get into a cat fight with kids. Sandler's wife is probably the only one who calibrated her character correctly. The rest of them are doing the Sandler thing and it's not funny anymore. The story structure is basic rom-com and it mostly works. Sandler has his fans and they may like this. More and more, I'm finding myself not one of them. This type of annoying characters may work if they go much harder as a black comedy with a dark ending.",The Wrong Missy
1,nogodnomasters,The Right Stuff,6,2 July 2020,"Tim (David Spade) meets Missy (Lauren Lapkus ) on a blind date and runs away. Later he meets another Missy (Molly Sims ) who has identical interests as himself. On a corporate retreat which involves a possible promotion, he invites Missy along but doesn't find out it is the wrong one until they board the plane. Imagine if people talked on the phone instead of text. Things go horrible as expected followed by things going great. Typically cliche script.Not exactly a chick flick, but it had all the parts. Funny at times. Adam Sandler wasn't in it so that is a plus.Guide"" F-word. Sex. No nudity.",The Wrong Missy
2,kosmasp,Right or wrong,7,21 June 2020,"Someone said this could have been another Adam Sandler movie. Well one of his ""comedies"" that is. That is not entirely untrue and there is more than just some merit to it. What is one major difference though: the female lead. While David Spade is the main character, she is stealing the show. Now as annoying as I think she is, as not attracted to that character I am (love the actress for sure), she is winning everyone over.And yes it is obvious and predictable where this is going. With all the hurdles and issues visible miles away. Some jokes are too extreme/gnarly and I almost want to not like the movie because of them ... but it's just too loveable. With cameos to boost and insanity to be released. But as I said: it's the female ""co-lead"" that makes this what it is ... very fine perfomance indeed",The Wrong Missy
3,jboothmillard,The Wrong Missy,3,4 March 2021,"Produced by Adam Sandler, this film was suggested to me by the Razzies, as an official voter, in preparation for their upcoming awards nominations, it certainly looked like it was going to be rubbish, but I was prepared for that. Basically, Tim Morris (Razzie nominated David Spade) has a blind date with Melissa, nicknamed Missy (Razzie nominated Lauren Lapkus), who is extremely strange. Missy's over-the-top personality, odd behaviour and Wild behaviour is too much for Tim. He tries sneaking out of the restaurant through a window, but is caught by Missy, and subsequently falls out, dislocating his ankle, which she fixes. Three months later, Tim is at the airport, and meets a beautiful woman, also named Melissa (Molly Sims), after they accidentally switch their luggage cases. They connect in a bar, finding that have much in common and seem to be perfect for each other. After sneaking into a janitor's closet, they share a kiss and almost engage in sex, before she is forced to stop and leave him, but she gives him her number. He begins texting ""Melissa"" and eventually invites her to his work retreat in Hawaii. However, on the plane, Missy shows up, and Tim realises he had been texting the wrong Melissa. Missy drugs Tim, forcibly giving him a tranquilizer, and he awakens later on the plane journey to her non-consensually masturbating him, and the bumpy journey causes him to unintentionally ejaculate. In Hawaii, Jack Winstone (Geoff Pierson), the new CEO, welcomes everyone. Missy is awkward and wild and always seems to end up embarrassing Tim in front of his boss and colleagues. At the hotel, he awakens to her on top of him, having non-consensual sex with him in his sleep. Tim explains to his colleague and friend Nate (Nick Swardson) that he cannot bring himself to get rid of her, as she claims he ""saved her life"" when she was standing on top of a bridge and meaning to jump, he does not want to cause her to become suicidal. Missy often becomes reckless and intoxicated and her behaviour results in humiliation for Tim. This includes a trip shark hunting in the sea. However, as time goes on, she starts to help Tim do well at his work retreat and to win Winstone's favour by hypnotising him. Missy reveals that when she said she was going to jump, and that he saved her, she was referring to a bungie jump experience. Despite this, Tim slowly finds himself falling for her. Tim's workplace competitor Jess (Jackie Sandler, Adam's wife) is not pleased with Winstone giving a job to Tim instead of her. Jess decides to reveal to Missy that she was invited by accident and was not the one Tim wanted to invite. Missy checks Tim's phone and finds out the truth. Saddened and devastated, she leaves Hawaii. At that moment, the real Melissa arrives in Hawaii, having been invited by Jess. At lunch, Tim cannot fully commit to the date, and gets drunk. Tim lets Melissa know that he has feelings for someone else and leaves Hawaii for Portland. Tim tries to communicate with Missy, but she ignores him, he also snaps Winstone out of hypnosis that Missy performed on him, and Winstone ends up firing him. Posing as someone else, Tim is able to lure Missy to the same bar they first met. He tricks her to approach the wrong man at the bar, it turns out to be Vanilla Ice (himself). Tim approaches and explains that he was playing the same joke that Missy did on him when they first met. Tim apologises and tells her all the things that he likes about her and that he wants to be more like her. She forgives him, and they kiss. Also starring Sarah Chalke as Julia, Chris Witaske as Rich, Rob Schneider as Komante, Lost's Jorge Garcia as the Guy on the Plane, and Jared Sandler (Adam's nephew) as Stuart. Spade is okay as the guy constantly with the nightmare one-time date, and Lapkus goes all out as the ""girlfriend"" who is multiskilled but with almost no moral compass, just saying and doing whatever she wants, with no regard. It is a predictable story, a guy paired with the unbelievably outrageous girl who slowly becomes charmed by her, there are the outlandish moments and dialogue that genuinely made me titter, but this is just throwaway stuff, an only slightly amusing but hardly worthwhile romantic comedy. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screen Combo for Lauren Lapkus and David Spade. Adequate!",The Wrong Missy
4,BandSAboutMovies,Enjoyably stupid,4,9 June 2020,"David Spade's character Tim Morris has a problem. He thinks he's going to his company's retreat with Missy (Molly Sims), but he's really going with an insane woman he had a blind date gone wrong with (Laura Lapkus) who is also named Missy. I mean, the date was so bad that he got beat up by Roman Reigns and broke his leg trying to escape from her. Things get way crazier from there.This is a Happy Madison movie starring so many of Adam Sandler's friends like Spade, Rob Schneider, Nick Swardson and even his wife, Jackie Sandler and nephew Jared Sandler. Your enjoyment of the film will depend in your ability to turn off your mind and laugh, as well as enjoy that special Sandler brand of humor.It's directed by Tyler Spindel, who also was behind Father of the Year. This movie managed to hit me in the right time and space, so I got several big guffaws out of the film. Your mileage, as the kids say, may vary.Lapkus is wonderful in this and deserves so much more. Here's hoping she gets a chance to be a star.",The Wrong Missy
5,Calicodreamin,"Unfortunately, most of the jokes fall flat",4,13 May 2020,A fairly cliche storyline peppered with a few funny moments. Most of the jokes miss the mark and the tortured storyline didn't sell this one. The main characters had no chemistry and the acting felt blasé.,The Wrong Missy
6,deloudelouvain,The tone is set from the start. If you don't like it in the beginning just stop watching it.,8,19 June 2020,"This is a typical comedy that will divide people, some will love it and others will hate it. You can count me in the ones that had a really good time watching this movie. I wanted to watch a funny movie and that's exactly what I got. There are plenty of hilarious moments, maybe annoying to some but who cares? If you don't like it after five minutes just stop watching it because the rest of the movie will be the same kind of humor. I thought the chemistry between David Spade and Lauren Lapkus worked perfectly. Rob Schneider and Nick Swardson also added to the comedy, it was just a good mix of comedians. People bashing Lauren Lapkus because she was annoying just don't get it, that's exactly the role she had, to annoy as much people as possible, so I would say very good job doing that. Do I think she was annoying? Definitely, I wouldn't want to know a woman like that in my personal life, but it's a movie so wake up and stop bitching. The story is lighthearted, nothing too serious, just funny, dumb and sometimes vulgar humor, so what? I wish there were more comedies like this one.",The Wrong Missy
7,Edvis-1997,7,7,13 May 2020,"I wouldn't agree with people that this movie so bad as described. It wasn't moder plot film, I can agree on that and the plot maybe wasn't original but it reminded me of good comedy from 2000's and I liked that a lot. Some jokes(not few but kind of a lot) made me laugh and that what was I looking for. As 2020 movie it's pretty decent.",The Wrong Missy
8,cruise01,Stupid humor but pretty entertaining and fun.,6,15 May 2020,"The Wrong Missy (3 out of 5 stars).The Wrong Missy is a fair comedy film that is filled with stupid humor which is what you can expect from a Happy Madison production. A comedy movie that does have that typical predictable story and cliches but it is kind of entertaining.The plot follows Tim (David Spade) who had a bad blind date when he met Melissa (Lauren Lapkus) with her loud, obnoxious, and weird personality. Months later, he meets another woman Melissa (Molly Sims) which her personality is like his dream woman. They swapped numbers and went there own ways in the airport. When his company is throwing a retreat in Hawaii. He decides to invite Melissa. Which he gets a surprise in the airport when Melissa from the blind date shows up. Which she tries to take charge of every situation she is in at his work party.It is a predictable plot which you can tell who is going to get with who before it happens. Tim has an enemy at work which she hates him and is always trying to be better than him in front of there boss. She will be a conflict to Tim's secret about Missy and his dream girl Melissa. Tim and Missy are the opposites. He is quiet and passive. She is loud and clumsy.Missy played by Lauren Lapkus is entertaining. She may act stupid and have that loud personality. Sometimes her performance may be overboard trying to get laughs. Which may be annoying than funny. She did decent with the character. David Spade, Molly Sims, Nick Swardson, and even Rob Schneider did decent with the performances. May not be great acting. But they are all entertaining with having fun with their characters.If you seen previous Happy Madison production movies that Adam Sandler produced and enjoyed it. Than you will enjoy this as well. Simple predictable plot. With actors having fun with their characters. And plenty of dumb humor.",The Wrong Missy
9,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,1,21 May 2020,"The wrong missy had the idea, but went overboard with it. The casting was questionable for the reasons it was picked and the main character, Missy, was way too annoying and weird to enable the viewer to root for her. Not to mention that, even though she tries to open up about herself, in the end, no one knows who she is or what is her deal. Other than that, the main story was predictable.",The Wrong Missy
10,marmar-69780,the wrong missy,3,29 July 2020,"The wrong missy was another comedy that felt short to make me laugh on loud,there were some scenes that make me to smirk but nothing all,this movie was produced and made by Adam Sandler company and unfortunetly it is easy noticable not just because of cast but also weak script,rude and sex based jokes and loud annoying unlikeable characters,who were so loud and unfunny with their jokes that it become painful to watch them on screen,David Spade was again completly unfunny to me and he was honestly waste of screentime and space,our lead girl character was only likeable and funny person in a film and she had some fun moments,The Wrong Missy was yet another comedy that failed to make me laugh big time",The Wrong Missy
11,RosanaBotafogo,Cute...,8,23 May 2020,"Very silly, highly exaggerated, but I tied myself to the crazy Lauren Lapkus, she has a familiar touch, total empathy in the happy and clueless Missy, which in the end, of course, predictable, was the right miss ...

Tim wants to invite her with him on his work retreat in Hawaii, but he accidentally texts Missy and things take an unexpected turn.

13,DarkVulcan29,"A big surprise to me, I was very entertained.",8,17 May 2020,"Not saying this was a great movie, it's not , but an enjoyable one, never tries to be anything more. The cast really make the comedy worth while. The story of a guy(David Spade) who is basically a good guy, but is pretty much down on his luck with love, after a miserable blind date with Missy(Lauren Lapkus) who is beyond wild and crazy, he seems to find love with another woman who is also named Missy(Molly Sims). He is soon to ask to go a business trip that could help his career, and he texts Missy if she liked to go with him, she says yes, but the problem is it's not the Missy he was hoping for.
Lauren Lapkus plays a very funny character, I thought I was gonna be annoyed by her character, but suprisingly I was not. And David Spade is also quite effective has a straight man, and never really playing it as total jerk, but has a flawed but descent guy. The location at the hotel is also pretty nice. And the rest of the cast do well also.",The Wrong Missy
14,JoBloTheMovieCritic,The Wrong Missy,5,23 May 2020,5/10 - many jokes failed to land in this Netflix comedy with an irritating male lead (David Spade) and an often-obnoxious female lead (Lauren Lapukus),The Wrong Missy
15,GiraffeDoor,"Admittedly, I did not hate it quite as much as I thought I would. And I am not proud of that.",7,15 May 2020,"Wowee, is this one a doozy...I remember seeing the trailer and thinking: Really? You know when a trailer just tells you everything about a movie's plot? The thing itself basically conveys two thirds and you can totally guess where they go for the final third. If you've seen any movie ever, you can guess it. I don't want to give spoilers but that way you think it will end: you're right (I suspect).Here's the thing about Netflix or any other streaming platforms: they are free from a constraint that previous generations of televisions had to deal with: the fact that there are only so many hours in the day. With no broadcasting schedule to deal with we find certain positives, such as how programming is made for types of people rather than needing to commit to mass appeal so much. But there are also negatives, like how with all this free space, it gets filled with the same conveyor belt entertainment that we might otherwise have moved beyond. If you think of any Adam Sandler movie of the 2000s, this is something like that except better. Is this a bad movie? I'm going to say no. I stand by my grade 7 out of 10 but I couldn't give that without keeping any would-be viewer fore-warned.I started this planning to just see the first 5 minutes out of curiosity and ended up watching the whole thing. There's something to be said for going through with no high hopes, just tolerant curiosity and that might be what made me get as much from this movie as I did. Now this movie has problems, do not forget that, and I will soon get to them.before we continue let's talk about David Spade. The name was familiar but I couldn't place where I'd seen him before. Then it hit me, he's that annoying guy who usually has a beard. So if nothing else you get a clean shaven David Spade. But seriously, I was quite impressed by him going against type here and actually playing someone serious and tightly wound and plays it most convincingly.Now for the plot. I usually hate it when a review here includes a plot summary (it's like the first thing IMDB tells you about any movie) but the story is so cookie cutter it's fascinating how this got greenlit. It's a standard reluctant odd couple comedy with a ""fun"" one and a serious one, brought together by mistake. One finds the other annoying for a while and then less so. It's a skeleton of a story that offers no surprises except by way of its gags so it often feels like it was put together by manatees (that's a South Park reference even though I'm team Family Guy). It might be because I had low expectations but they come so fast and thick that its pleasantly distracting.Now let's talk about our title character: it's sort of nice to see a female character who, you know...has a personality. The whole point is that she's annoying and you can't say they did not hit the mark there. The bombastic and outrageous shenanigans you gets up to might not exactly be classy entertainment but its captivating the same way watching reckless stunts online leaves you unable to look away. One thing you can't deny about American comedies is that they put a lot of character into their characters.But there is this other thing: I'm not sure how best to say this but, Missy...the thing about Missy is...well...she's a rapist. She rapes him. This is not a spoiler any more than anything in the trailer is. But she rapes him. It's not like some twist or plot point where he confronts her about it, it's fascinating how they just glass over this. And she does it twice! I'm old enough to know rape is not a special kind of evil even if it is a special kind of issue, but do me a favour: if you do decide to watch this just bare in mind how different this movie might seem if the genders were flipped. I'm not trying to go full MRA, I acknowledge rape culture is an extension of patriarchy, it's just rather baffling as a thing.Missy is a maniacal, self absorbed , narcissistic, manipulative sexual predator. You might try and tell me ""the whole point is that she's annoying"". Well, a lot of people feel the crux of a movie is not how we start or where we end up but the journey and process it brings us. And the way that it seems to paint David Spade as in the wrong when he has really been a prolonged victim and it annoys me to for there to be any implication that he owes an apology to anyone but himself.There is so much plot convenience here...who would ever invite someone on a flight to Hawaii and never actually phone them? You just have to meet them half way so much. And by the way: Missy is immortal. It makes more sense than the alternative. Regarding the development of the relationship: there's really nothing to it but her doing (somewhat unscrupulous) things to his material benefit. That's it.This is not a movie to watch with your family, it's not a picture to for movie night, this is a reasonable time waster that is compelling for how problematic and illogical so much of it is.The ending was everything I assumed it would be except by how abrupt and easy it was. That's a credit to this movie: they did not seem to have the time to lay on the Schmaltz as thickly as in , say, 50 first dates.let's end with some positives. Only once do they cross the line from morally repugnant to physically repugnant and there are rewards in stall for those who keep with it. A lot of comedies think it is just totes hilar to snatch away fun stuff at the last minute but not here.",The Wrong Missy
16,alindsay-al,A Truly awful attempt at comedy,1,19 May 2020,"This film was recently added to Netflix and is the film most people are watching so I decided to watch The Wrong Missy and here is my review for the film. The premise sees a man meet his perfect woman in an airport but accidentally invites a disastrous blind date by the same name to his work retreat in Hawaii.
Main Character
David Spade plays the main character and he doesn't really do anything for me in this film. He plays the straight man in the comedic duo and you do sympathise with him a little bit because he is getting annoyed by Missy like we the audience are but there is nothing that stand out about him at all. His character is really boring and yes he has a bit of an arc in the film but it feels incredibly generic and unrealistic which really hurts the film.
Supporting Characters
Lauren Lapkus plays Missy and wow this is one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen in a film or TV Show. She is so annoying it is incredible, it is absolutley absurd and there isn't one likeable trait about her whatsoever. She makes Spade's life miserable and you really want her to go away with her story being so forced it cannot be understated. The rest of the cast are all the stereotypes you could imagine in a film like this, the ex wife, the abnoxious new boyfriend, the work rival and the older rich boss and none of them are interesting at all.
Story
If you read the premise of the film you can guess exactly where the film is going, I sat down before watching the film and predicted a few things that a generic film would have and this film hits every single one but does it really poorly. As mentioned there are no reedemable elements to the character with Missy so her relationship Spade's character is really weak and feels really underdeveloped and just forced. Plus there are some things that take place in this film that if a man did them to a woman this film would never have been made or it would be causing controversy but because it is the other way round people just don't care.
Script
The script is reall bad, this is a comedy but I don't think I laughed once during this film which is an automatic failure for a film trying to make me laugh. The drama is attempted but also falls down flat and feels stupid and trivial for this weak film.
Style
This film tries to go for shock comedy, I mean this is my least favourite comedy and this film follows that trend, it just doesn't do anything interesting enough to make it funny. Luckily this film is only about 90 minutes long which means you don't have to sit through it for that long, but they spend so much time on the Spade not liking Missy there is not enough time for the film convincingly to hit its landing.
Overall
Overall, I feel like I truly wasted my time watching this film, these bad comedies made by this group really are bad and are not worth the time of day and should just stop being made.",The Wrong Missy

18,iquine,Standard Spade Humor with a Decent Story; Nothing New,6,24 June 2020,"(Flash Review)Can a blind date that starts off as a catastrophe end up in true love? David Spade plays a middle age fellow who meets two women named Missy/Melissa, associates the wrong phone number with the wrong name in his phone. He thinks he is texting the hotter one to accompany him on a work vacation trip. When they meet up ON THE airplane, it is the weirdo Missy, from a bad blind date that shows up much to his shock and chagrin. Stuck now, he makes the best of it. She is super outgoing and he is not and she does many wild things around his coworkers. Will he find her actions irritating or will they eventually grow on him and help him break out of his more reserved shell? And what will happen with the hotter and more normal Missy? There are some funny jokes and scenarios and many of them hit; not all do. Lapkus steals the limelight from Spade as her character is supposed to. Overall, it is a better movie that Spade has been in for a with many solid chuckles to be had.",The Wrong Missy
19,r96sk,I'm usually a glass-half-full type of guy,1,16 May 2020,"Deary me. It's a miracle I survived until the end.'The Wrong Missy' is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I'm usually a glass-half-full type of guy, I always attempt to find the good sides to a film first before identifying the worse parts. With this, there is simply nothing to praise.Lauren Lapkus is horrifically annoying as Melissa, I have never been so cringed out and/or irritated when watching a character. I do have one solace of minor praise for Lapkus herself though, as she really does commit to the role - arguably too much so. There are moments late on when I see potential for her/Melissa if the script et al. was better.It's the filmmakers who probably deserve most of the hate for this, though the cast should still be doing more - David Spade in particular. He is very poor in the lead role as Tim, I never felt he was giving 100% here - I'm positive he can do so much more. Elsewhere, not even Sarah Chalke of 'Scrubs' or Geoff Pierson of 'Dexter' could save this. Nick Swardson (Nate) is the only semi-bearable person onscreen, while there's at least a notable celebrity cameo at one point.Terrible premise with awful dialogue, which relies almost entirely on sex/toilet humour, all alongside some dreadful acting and extremely unfunny comedy. As always with my reviews it is nothing personal, but this is a severely unpleasant film.",The Wrong Missy

The characters are indistructable as you will see during their life threatening escapades and they always come out like fresh roses.David Spade pulls off his subdued character 'Tim' perfectly.

At any point, if Spade's character leaned into Missy, then maybe we wouldn't have a movie of her destroying his retreat.Its a movie of iterating ridiculousness, but man is it entertaining.

[+32%],3,17 May 2020,"This film embodies what Happy Madison Productions stands for - a nonsensical script (or a lack of one!), lots of slapstick humor that don't make you laugh, over-the-top histrionics, lazy performances, and a meh 'happy' ending. David Spade sleepwalks through his role, shadowed heavily by Lauren Lapkus who is expected to be annoying 24*7. The screenplay doesn't offer anything substantial for either for these performers; it's glad sticking to its gross-out, physical comedy for the most part.Roman Reigns and Vanilla Ice pop up in cameos - no clue why they'd sign up for something this abysmal. The only person who legit made me laugh in the movie was Nick Swardson, who plays the nosy HR Manager Nate. Lapkus tries her best to salvage the film by making at least her character stand out, but with a script as clichéd as this, nothing really works.

Even the bad jokes are admirable. Lauren Lapkus steals it, as you may have expected. David Spade is in classic form, though I wished they utilized more of his caustic wit. Rob Schneider (drumroll) has a really funny cameo. See it and you'll believe it. It's very refreshing to see this.

29,mitsubishizero,Hilariously nuts,8,23 May 2020,"This's Adam Sandler what did you expect? He's known for this kind of comedy. Unapologetically raunchy and over-the-top. David Spade plays a man named Tim who gets duped into dating a nut played by Lauren Lapkus who has the same name of his intended date (Molly Sims). Things get worse when he accidentally invites her to a resort where she proceeds to wreck as much havoc as possible. But it's ok it's done out of love. Did I mention his boss' there too?So yeah, this's a crazy movie. The actors are great in their roles as the straight man and crazy chick. David Spade as a hapless man gets so many laughs but the wrong Missy is a riot to laugh at with her bucked eyes, no-holds-barred attitude. Really there's a scene where she smuggled a giant knife through the airport and later hypnotized his boss in attempt to help him.I swear I haven't laughed this hard at a comedy since ""The Other Guys"". As much as Sandler and his crew get a bad rep from the critics he still churns out some decent movies that are obviously meant for the audience.

31,kjproulx,"It Tries, but it's Way Too Predictable",4,28 May 2020,"Over the years it's been a slow descent for Happy Madison Productions. Whether you're talking about Mr. Deeds or more dramatic films like Reign Over Me, they've had their share of solid entertainment. Aside from thinking Netflix's film Murder Mystery was fine, I'd say every film since Funny People back in 2009 has been a disappointment to say the least. For that reason alone, I've taken a pass on movies like The Week Of and Father of the Year. For some reason, after seeing an advertisement for The Wrong Missy (this studio's latest release on Netflix) I decided to give it a watch. It may not be quite as bad as some of their more recent outings, but The Wrong Missy is all kinds of cliche.The film follows Tim Morris (David Spade) after he has met the first girl that he thinks he can fall in love with. He then proceeds to text her and hopes to bring her on his work trip. Well, it just so happens that this girl has the same name as a girl he had a blind date with once and they end up on the trip together instead. She can't get enough of him and he can't stand her. Hijinks ensue and I'm sure you can predict every major story beat that occurs from there. By the time the third act was starting, I found myself rolling my eyes. With that said, not everything about this movie is bad.The premise of this movie is something that could probably work as a very good comedy if it was written better. David Spade and Lauren Lapkus actually shared a few funny moments together, but I found their chemistry wore pretty thin by the end, thus not even caring about their outcome all that much. The first act of this movie was a nice little set-up for the character of Tim, but the way they set up Missy just had me worried that I would have to spend an entire film with this character. I've liked Lapkus in films/shows before and she wasn't bad here, but her over-the-top performance got old pretty fast for me. Still, I have to admit, although not all that great, the first act kept me engaged enough.Sadly, there really wasn't a lot that added to these passable elements. The set-up was fine and the pay off was incredibly predictable, so I was left wondering what, in any way, was special about this one. Not that I expect a lot of meat to the story with a film from Happy Madison, but you'd think every now and then they would try to surprise everyone with a great one. Directed by Tyler Spindel, who has appeared as small characters in a few comedies and had his biggest hit be Father of the Year a couple of years ago on Netflix, I can probably say that this is his best directorial effort yet (although I have yet to see Father of the Year), but I think maybe he should try his hand at a different genre.In the end, the chemistry between these two and the nice little set-up at the beginning is what held my attention, but this movie does nothing more to make it worthwhile. I will say this though, even though it's been a long time since Rob Schneider has made me laugh, his glorified cameo in this movie is easily the funniest part. I mean, his character traits feel very very lazy and his character is really just thrown in to garner a few extra laughs, but he worked for exactly that. I really don't have many positive things to say about this film and the few positives I did mention, just wasn't enough to get me to recommend this one. I'd definitely take a pass on it.",The Wrong Missy
32,0w0,It's not very funny but it's OK...,6,16 May 2020,"First criticism: They should've included the bloopers in the credits... If they had done that, I would probably have laughed more and given this a 7/10 instead.I knew from watching the trailer on youtube that this movie was going to not be good, and it turns out I was correct... however, this movie did make me laugh 3 times, which isn't too shabby, considering I don't laugh very easily... still, 3 times in 85minutes? That's 1 laugh every 30minutes, which is pretty poor.I also found the fact that Nick Swardson is fat now really surprising... The last movie I watched of his was Grown Ups 2 (2013) and it's shocking how much weight he put on... I hope the guy realizes that it's a very drastic change from his previous movies, and that people (like me) find it shocking...Anyway, Lauren Lapkus is the star of the movie... She did an absolute amazing job in the movie, and ALL the scenes where the laughter came from, was scenes with her in it... The movie would be trash without her in it, that's how much she carried this movie. I'm really surprised by her performance.Overall, it's a pretty unfunny comedy, which underwhelms 90% of the time. If you're looking for a 'laugh a minute' movie, then you'd better avoid this one. Lauren Lapkus was excellent though. 5.5 out of 10.",The Wrong Missy

It's not a 5 star theatrical masterpiece, but it's great for a boring night. I only subscribe to Netflix when they add new movies (for the most part), and I wasn't disappointed with this movie. I also expect a little more now that their memberships can be a bit pricey, especially each month (compared to your average $7 streaming movie rental, anyway), so that should say something.This movie seems really well written -- mainly the jokes, but the story isn't bad either, even if not very unique (I'm sure the double name mixup has been done before).I actually found this movie to be really funny, especially the first bar scene and the interaction with the other couple, but others too.",The Wrong Missy

I was taken aback as I had an unnerving feeling I recognised the male protagonist. I realised I was confused (& distracted) as it is David Spade minus his moustache. He plays against type as the straight laced character & Lauren Lapkus is the hyper active, eccentric character with whom he wrongly set up a second blind date after finding another person that seemed to be perfectly matched. The comedy ensues from this mistake & surprisingly it is funnier than I imagined.I kind of guessed that he ends up with her despite having very little in common. It follows the romantic comedy formula that sometimes that the person with whom you end up is not necessary the one you long or lust for at the start.. That love trumps lust at the end of the day...This reminds me of the wedding crashers & the wedding singer. It's worth a watch.",The Wrong Missy

It's a typical rom-com with a predictable story that doesn't have much of a script.

Her hysteric behavior works playing opposite the unsuspecting straight role from David Spade.

.
In this comedy, a man thinks he's invited the woman of his dreams on a work retreat to Hawaii, realizing too late he mistakenly texted someone from a nightmare blind date.
.
It's mildly funny at times and annoying at other moments, but Laura Lapkus makes you want to watch further. It's an easy 90-minute hit or miss comedy that features all recycled gags. Going back to my reference about ""The Heartbreak Kid"", the 2007 remake of that film of the same name was actually co-written by Kevin Barnett who also co-wrote this film; ""The Wrong Missy"". Coincidence? I think not. Having done this research, it made me realize that Barnett for sure used gags that didn't make it in that 2007 remake with Ben Stiller. Overall, yet another brainless quarantine Netfilx film that once I've posted this review; I've already forgotten about.

Overall rating 73/100The wrong missy is based on a guy called Tim Morris (David Spade) who meets the girl of his dreams. So when it comes to a weekend away for his work he invites her, only to find he has been texting a terrible blind date the whole time. I enjoyed the wrong missy a lot, but I did have a few issues with it so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the concept itself was interesting and there was a good amount of character background. I thought the whole idea of meeting the girl of your dreams but accidentally messaging a girl of the same name who is the complete opposite was a really interesting idea and explored well throughout so just a general good positive. They also went into a good amount of character background into the main character and his job and what life is like for him as well as spending a good amount of time on his bad blind date with the other Missy (Lauren Lapkus) So I appreciated this as a lot of movies assume we already know the characters.However, my first negative would be the film's rushed beginning. I felt like after spending so much time with the first date at the beginning I felt as if the beginning was then very much meet perfect girl and then text the wrong one, it had no imbetween stage so it just felt slightly rushed and needed more time so the main character could either be fleshed out more, or to have him spend more time with the girl of his dreams.My next positive would be the film's fun and likeable characters. I felt like the film had a wide variety of different supporting characters that had their own goals within the film and their own distinct likeable parts to their personality, all the characters had something to do which is not always the case with some movies. But Lauren Lapkus who played the wrong missy was the most likeable character and made the movie for me but I will get more into that in a future paragraph.My next two negatives would be the generic meet up between the main character and his dream girl and the predictable twist. I felt like the whole meeting between the main character and his perfect girl was slightly to corny and generic for me, they bumped into each other and accidentally switched luggage's and suddenly had everything in common, it was just a bit to cringey for me and I have seen it done to many times before. Also, I found the whole plot twist very predictable. I liked the whole concept of the main character texting the wrong girl, but it was executed poorly. I could tell he texted the wrong person as soon as he did it, she messaged him with completely different things to what his dream girl would have said so this was a bit of a shame.My next two positives would be the film's comedic performances and humour. Most of the comedic performances within the film were fantastic. Key standouts being Nick Swardson and Geoff Pierson. Who both had multiple great comedic moments throughout and were great whenever they were on screen. But my main comedic performance that made the movie for me was Lauren Lapkus. She was absolutely hilarious. She was so crazy and random that you couldn't help but oddly fall in love with her quirky character, she had countless amounts of hilarious moments throughout and she was infectious to watch.My final two negatives would be the lapses in the logic and the bad main character. The film had a few moments where the scenes were slightly to ridiculous and the character would have died. When Lauren Lapkus's character attempted to dive off a cliff but tripped and fell repeatedly on the side of the cliff onto the ground below it was to unrealistic for her to be absolutely fine and was slightly distracting for the movie. My biggest issue with the movie was sadly the main character played by David spade. He just wasn't funny at all, all the other characters around him were hilarious and he was just for me out of place during the whole movie. I also felt the script was written for a much younger actor so it felt slightly creepy at time having a man nearing 60 doing some of the things in the movie.My final two positives would be the film's character development and satisfying ending. I thought the development of the relationship between David Spade's character was really good. As they slowly changed from hating each other to realising that Missy is actually in her own way a really nice person, and his character needed her to be taken out of the picture to realise she was the craziness and fun missing from his life so this was definitely well executed. The ending was also very satisfying when David spade met the ""girl of his dreams"" only to find he does everything he didn't do at the beginning of the movie was great and the reunion between him and Missy was well executed with a clever link back to the beginning.Overall The wrong Missy get's it right with the humour, most of the casting and a mostly well executed interesting Idea. But falls short in terms of execution of it's creativity and wrongly casting the lead role. But is still a good time and held together by Lauren Lapkus.",The Wrong Missy

47,Brooklynsmagicmike,Not enough charm or humor to be considered great but is decent watch overall.,7,22 March 2021,First I want to start off with that I did like and enjoy this movie. I just diddn't think it was anything you'd brag to your friends about or worth watching a second time.The pacing of the movie was good. The visuals on the island were great and I thought the acting from all parties was fine. As far as comedies go the movie is funny. But I wouldn't go as far to say its laugh out loud. The problem I think had more to do with almost 80% of the jokes originating from Lauren Lapkus and most of them being sex based jokes. Which by time your little over halfway through the movie her character and those jokes get played out. As far as the romance aspect go I think the movie failed miserably. By the time the connection really happens it feels rushed and is not as charming as compared to other Adam Sandler type films.Would I recommend the movie? While it wasn't my favorite. I would tell others to give it a watch if you've got nothing else to do because it isn't bad movie. Just don't expect to have your socks knocked off.,The Wrong Missy

Seriously, the film is so dumb and lame that you'll either fall asleep, get bored or manage to make it to the finish after predicting every careless joke.Not only is the humour portrayed by Lauren Lapkus completely and mindlessly forgettable, it relies on slapstick violence, sexual assault and vulgar dialogue for a few laughs. The Wrong Missy is a tasteless way of enjoying the crass-comedy genre, and you're much better off skipping this painful waste of time.What's the actual point in the type of humour spread throughout this mortification? The absorbing plot is also sent to waste by the unlikeable characters, annoying behaviour and sometimes insulting humour. The offensive humour is usually the comedic depictions of sexual violence, which somehow, the individuals are supposed to find funny. You'll also have to enjoy and chuckle at over-the-top performers staging dumbly vulgar characters to be able to enjoy this ""comedy"".

56,Jared_Andrews,Relentlessly Dumb,3,21 June 2020,"On the recommendation of a few friends, I gave this movie a shot. After watching the entire movie, I have concluded that I probably will not take their next recommendation.I kept hearing that the first five minutes of ""The Wrong Missy"" made people laugh as much as any movie they have seen in the past few years. So, I figured I would give it five minutes, hopefully I would agree about how funny it was, and I would at least tolerate the remaining 90 minutes. But that didn't happen.Including the first five minutes, this movie never felt like anything more than a complete waste of time. Inexplicably, I continued to watch the whole movie, despising it the entire time, hardly cracking a smile.David Spade has been funny enough in certain past moments, but he is not funny here. His opportunity to elevate sunken material is limited, so it's hard to know how much blame he deserves. I will say definitively that I do not blame Lauren Lapkus for this film's failure. She commits to her role with admirable enthusiasm, never letting up for a moment. Kudos to her for trying her best. She clearly has potential. In a different role and movie, she could be very funny.I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler. Let me be clear, I'm a fan of Adam Sandler, the person. By all accounts he is a genuinely kind and humble individual, and he seems like he would be a blast to hang out with.However, many of the comedy movies he has made lately have been unwatchably awful. They have been lazy, broadly uninteresting and bafflingly stupid. And that's what ""The Wrong Missy"" is. It is relentlessly dumb. It never makes an effort to be even the tiniest bit believable.If you're a fan of Adam Sandler, I recommend watching ""Uncut Gems."" It's not his typical performance or type of movie, but it's a wild, riveting ride. If you are in the mood for a comedy, then try ""The Lovebirds."" Both of these are on Netflix now.",The Wrong Missy

Spade's rather dull performance is completely overshadowed by that of Lapkus, who shows off some talent that soon is so overplayed you wish for the film to end.

YeahA vacation hotspot so the Sandlers can have a free holiday? YeahThe same jokes and cast members? YeahRandom cameos from people famous in the 90s?

71,rmmil,"Why was I ever a Happy-Madison fan, again?",2,25 May 2020,"I will say this about Happy-Madison films, they are consistent, in theme, tone, ""message"", etc. But that's probably a bad thing, because this movie feels exactly like many other recent HM movies too.
I will say this, kudos to Adam Sandler, David Spade, and the other HM regulars, they have a pretty sweet gig. Adam Sandler has openly admitted that whenever Netflix approaches him for a movie, his demands are a big fat paycheck, and that the movie be filmed somewhere nice so it acts like a vacation for him. This HM film doesn't have Adam (because he was too busy being a ""serious"" actor again, wonder how long that'll last?), instead it stars his pan burger partner buddy, David Spade.
David plays a typical ""loser"" in HM films, but somehow, like all HM films, he draws the attention of women who are way, way too attractive for him. Molly Sims, Sarah Chalke? Are you kidding me? In his dreams.
It seems like a small point, but having models lust over David Spade significantly reduces the believability factor of this movie by quite a bit.
The plot is okay enough, and Lauren Lapkus' attempt to bring life to this film is commendable. She definitely gives this film her everything. Nick Swardson is also in this, but I can tell why his comedy act consists of ""Remember me, I was in Grandma's Boy?"" Not a funny guy.
Stupid stuff happens in the film that doesn't matter much, the plot is throw-away. There's also a really stupid ""threesome scene"" that ""goes wrong"" because one of the participants keeps getting karate kicked in the head. There's the level of quality you're getting here.

The film is silly in every possible way but there are some moments which will surely gives you a good laugh but if you watch it critically then the very same moments might be disturbing and you might call it a molestation but for me those were LOL moments. Locations were exotic with some beautiful ladies around and then there was missy played by Lauren Lapkus, doing all the heavy liftings and it was good to watch her in a lead, she did a good job.

I have also watched most movies starring his close mates like Rob Schneider,David Spade, Nick Swardson, Kevin James and the rest of the bunch. This is a movie that you will enjoy only if you enjoy the Sandler brand of comedy. My only regret after watching the movie was that it could have been 15-20 mins longer. They should have had more laughs and some sort of background story on the main characters. The lady who plays the lead has a face made for comedy.

Comedies are hard to pull off, I'm sure I'd make a rubbish one, and certainly the last few I've seen were formulaic and short on laughs. Lauren Lapkus however is the silver bullet that elevates this movie above many others. Yes its crass and dumb, but there's such a 110% from Lauren as her character it pulls it off. One might say maybe there wasn't enough of her in the movie. Nick Swardson and Rob Schneider have a few good lines but are small parts, and David Spades character although the main is really just the straight foil to Missy. Pitters off a bit in the third act but some good laugh out loud moments before then thanks to Missy.",The Wrong Missy
82,heyimmyx,Immy's review : The stupidest movie I have ever watched,1,15 August 2020,"I quite frankly lost brain cells whilst watching this. Firstly, David Spade (Tim Morris) barely made an effort with his performance, and looked like he didn't want to be there throughout the entirety. Missy's character was so strange and weird. They made her way too over the top annoying and vulgar to the point where you really dislike her character. I mean nobody acts like that. The comedy aspect was cringe worthy ; the timing of the jokes was always off and they always dragged on a joke for too long, thus there was no strong comedic effect. Maybe it's because I'm not American, but I really don't find the humour in these movies funny. It's just dumb and overly vulgar to the point it's uncomfortable. The majority of the movies 'laughs' was just over Tim being appalled by Missy's strange and embarrassing behaviour. That was it, and all that the movie had going for it. The romance was appalling ; David's romantic feelings for her arose extremely quickly, and almost out of nowhere. They had no chemistry, as one could barely act, and the other was too annoying. The last thirty minutes was completely predictable, with him finally realising he actually likes her and dropping everything he has to finally be with her. The movie felt very rushed, using what seemed like shutter stock videos of the city / scenery to get extra running time for the movie, but this just made it feel like something out of Beverly Hills 90210. It felt like the director made little effort in making this movie, ultimately creating a dull, monotone and flat out weird comedy. There was no witty jokes, life lessons, or memorable and loveable characters.. It was just a shallow cheese-fest. Do not recommend.",The Wrong Missy

But that aside, it's just the usual forced comedy, which at one time was organic. Now they are just the annoying guys that never grew up, in a bad way.

It counts on shock-humor to get the laugh (and it does). Don't see it with kids anywhere near the room (it's pretty raunchy in THAT way).

103,thomasmitilis1995,THE AGE THING DOESN'T CONCERN ME. WHAT ARE YOU SIXTY-FIVE?,2,27 May 2020,"PROS:
~The confusion that is created with the messages of Spade's character is entertaining to watch and Nick Swardson deliver some funny lines.
~Despite her small screen time, Molly Sims seems to have better chemistry with Spade.CONS:
~Lauren Lapkus is annoying and intolerable. Sure, the whole point of the film is to be obnoxious but this is unbearable to watch. From the unfunny dating scene in the beginning (what's funny with the knife gag?) to her dancing sequence, you know that something is wrong with this movie. Furthermore, there are other scenes where her facial expressions are weird such as when she makes the Hellstar joke or her irritating yelling with some random kids. It seems like Missy has an actual personality disorder that needs medical attention.
~David Spade is just bland and uninteresting. His chemistry with Lapkus is nonexistent and the romantic element in the final act is out of place. I mean, there isn't a moment where you feel that the two of them fall in love (what's the point of the montage?). Moreover, there is no consistency to his character and his desicions in the end make no sense.
~The sexual stuff never lands. The airplane segment specifically isn't funny but cringy and wtf with the bed scene?
~The slapstic humor doesn't work and the cliff scene or the one with the shark in particular are the reason why comedy movies are in decline in recent years. In addition, the whole subplot about Spade's job is boring.",The Wrong Missy
104,nightwishouge,Can one committed performance save a lazy comedy?,5,21 June 2021,"There's a running joke (or rather more of an observation) that Happy Madison productions these days are built around whatever all-inclusive resorts the cast and crew want to visit. I haven't kept up with Adam Sandler since Mr. Deeds, so I can't comment on the rest of his creative output, but in the case of The Wrong Missy that is a dead-on description. This is a movie where you can feel everybody involved (especially David Spade) checking their watches between takes to see if they can get the day wrapped before their mid-afternoon massage.Well, almost everybody. The only reason I even watched the movie is because of Lauren Lapkus, a brilliant improviser whose work has impressed me across a wide range of (mainly) podcasts. She was the only bright spot (alongside Jake Johnson) in the lifeless nostalgia-grab Jurassic World, and similarly, in The Wrong Missy, Lapkus is the only one who actually seems to be trying. Alternating between psychotic, Satanic, and sweetly vulnerable, she humanizes rather than exploits the trope of the Nightmare Date, the unhinged girl you hate to meet but relish telling stories about afterward.Outside of that, the script is nothing new--or perhaps it's just nothing. The only funny moments have the loose feel of improvisation, such as the somber conversation between Nick Swardson and Rob Schneider about the likeability of the whale in Free Willy. Everything else is just going through the motions, shooting enough material to edit into a coherent 90 minutes so that Netflix will foot the bill for this Hawaiian vacation.As far as non-commitment goes, David Spade is the worst offender by far, barely flitting past a 3 on the emotional scale for the entire runtime. As a leading man he's pretty boring, with nothing to do apart from standing outside the action and flippantly commenting on it. I'm sure he demanded a script that would not only require a minimum of effort on his part but also portray him as the object of desire for every attractive female character in sight. (In addition to the Wrong Missy, both The Right Missy and the ex-fiancee harbor feelings for this mediocre, judgmental, mildly successful dullard who is twenty years older than they are.) It's too bad that Spade couldn't muster up an ounce of sincerity, because the romance really could have meant something.But, whatever. This isn't a movie that puts any real stock in entertaining you, but neither does it demand anything. It's best enjoyed as background noise while you're doing something productive. When something notable happens, you look up for a moment and take in sights and sounds, and then you go back to whatever you were doing, and after an hour and a half the credits roll and you feel vaguely satisfied at having watched something.",The Wrong Missy

Lauren Lapkus's character was just plain annoying. I'm sure Lauren is a lovely person. But, who in their right mind would even THINK of spending time with that god awful mindlessly dumb person?

134,FinneganBear,Waste of time.,1,21 May 2020,"This is another sloppy, lowbrow ""comedy"" by Adam Sandler's Happy Madison production company. There must be a market for this drivel because they keep churning them out. Hard to understand why, though. As another reviewer stated, it looks like David Spade is playing the part Sandler usually plays. Spade does as well as possible in the straight man role reacting to the nonstop bizarre situations created by the wrong Missy, played by Lauren Lapkus after Spade's character mistakenly texted her to join him on his work retreat in Hawaii when he thought he was texting the beautiful, refined Melissa. Lapkus has the role of the oddball Missy; strange looking, reckless without boundaries and most of all annoying. It's a tough role to make an annoying character likeable to the audience. Bill Murray did it so well in ""What About Bob?"" as his character had to be relentlessly annoying to his psychiatrist while managing to be endearing to the audience. Whether it's Lapkus' acting or the director, her Missy character is simply irritating, unpleasant and hard to watch.At times the movie plays like a cartoon. The wrong Missy falls off a cliff, violently strikes a rock after falling about a hundred feet, further falls into a tree before landing on the beach below. Had this been a drama, it would have been a well filmed, violent, horrifying scene. But instead of being dead, maimed or at the very least unconscious, Missy gets up laughing and without a scratch. Wile E. Coyote would be proud. In another scene she leaps off a pier trying in vain to catch Spade's boat which has already pulled substantially away only to inexplicably catch up and pull herself over the side. Still later, Spade channels his own inner Wile E. Coyote by doing a similar violent fall onto rocks with no significant injury.Spade's character continues to lament being in Hawaii with the wrong Missy who seems psychotic, irresponsible, dangerous and interferes with everything he does on his work retreat. But when one of her schemes actually benefits Spade with his boss he immediately does a complete 180 and decides he likes her and no longer wants the right Missy. Later when the psychotic Missy realizes she is there by mistake, she leaves in a cab, pulling out a Bowie knife and making a throat cutting gesture as the right Missy arrives. This should have been a pleasing moment as Spade is finally free of the horrible Missy and welcomes the right one. But inexplicably, he rejects her and yearns for the psycho who just drove off after that murderous gesture. Even more inexplicable, the audience is expected at this point to sympathize with Lapkus' character instead of breathing a sigh of relief that she is finally gone for the betterment of Spade as well as the audience.The plot makes no sense. And the actions of the characters make no sense even within the realm of the unbelievable plot. Even so, it would be easy to overlook the illogical, often cartoonish characters if the movie was actually funny. After all, we don't expect a high degree of realism from a comedy. But unfortunately, ""The Wrong Missy"" is simply not funny. So we are left with a stupid plot focusing on illogical and irritating characters. The entertainment value of this garbage is nil.",The Wrong Missy

But the character of Missy (played by the absolutely adorable Lauren Lapkus) was a little too over the top for me. But the laughs were genuine nonetheless. There was a serious lack of ROMANTIC chemistry between Lapkus' Missy and the movies lead Tim (played by the always hilarious David Spade) And I think that's mostly because of the writing for the Missy character which again was way over the top. It was more buddy movie than romantic movie...and that's fine. Again a funny film to watch a FEW times, but if it's a convincing romcom thing you're looking for, this might not be the movie for you.",The Wrong Missy

142,Silberfalke,Predictable and annoying,3,17 May 2020,"I have to admit, that I laughed a few times. But definitely sometimes it was not intended. ""The Wrong Missy"" was very annoying at times and while some jokes were landing, some were just disgustingly misfiring (in my personal perception). Sure, it's an Adam Sandler production so you know what to expect, but can there not be at least a bit more intelligence involved? Bodily fluids and vomit jokes are so cheesy and yesterday. We finished this movie, but we knew how it will end after like 15 minutes. And we were right. And Rob Schneiders character was so over the top dumb that I felt sorry for the actor, that he manages to lower his level from movie to movie. And don't get me wrong. I liked the cast but what was given to each of them came out of the lowest and least creative comedy drawer and the misfires outnumbered the few laughs that ""The Last Missy"" generated in us while watching it.",The Wrong Missy

It's more of the scary movie spoofs comedy where it is just completely dumb but gets some good laughs out it. It is also one of the movies that you are either going to love it and find it hilarious or you are going to hate it and find no humor in it at all.

The F word is frequently used, so much so that it was distracting and spoiled the whole film. To me, using the F word so frequently is just a sign of lazy writing. Tone and atmosphere and emotion can be shown in a myriad of other ways, but The Wrong Missy's writing makes all the characters sound basically the same.
Lots of alcohol and some drug use.
The acting is fairly good.
Scenery is nice.
Not much for a soundtrack.
Some memorable comedic moments, but overshadowed by the foul language.
Overall, if a wider variety of terms and phrases were used and the characters had some more development, this could have been a good movie. As it is, it misses the mark.

The whole text mix-up also makes no sense but the payoff is the substitution of inappropriate sexual activity in the place of actual funny situations. It is desperately sleazy. Well, we have no idea how to create a funny script so let's go over the top with bizarre, tasteless anti-female and pro-juvenile male sex acts in public places. That'll be funny because even though none of this makes any sense and isn't funny, it'll offend anyone with an IQ over 90. That'll show 'em!

The characters were likeable, even the ones you are meant to hate. Lauren Lapkus was a scream as Missy and nailed crazy to a tee.

I knew that i would either love it or hate it looking at the reviews. It just wasn't watchable. It felt like they were all out of ideas, inspiration, and comedy. I was also appalled by the two non consensual sex acts and suicide jokes-terrible messages. It's starting to feel like Netflix expects we'll watch anything.

211,jlcp-photo,"Not great, but funny enough",6,17 September 2020,"The actors did a good job and the comedy was fine - at points I laughed aloud - but my qualm with this movie is how lack of consent is used as comedy. There are two scenes where we essentially are given the message that ""rape is fine if it is done by women"": in two instances the male protagonist is basically date-raped by Missy.

It's not a sin to enjoy a simple movie, to stop the stress fron reality, to take a detour from the horrible things going on in today's world.
You're wathching a Happy Madison production, with Sandler's friends, a simple plot and yes, a 50 something year old men dating a 35 year old woman.
But i really don't understand the hate; when i want emotion i see Cinema Paradiso. When i want to be really scared , i see the exorcist....
Today, i really wanted to scape, be relaxed, and maybe have one or two laughs.I disagree with those who said: ''she's so cringe, he's so flat, the script is non existant'' (the latter being truth). Missy as a role is supossed to be unnerving, and the moments of surprising normality from her.....well i can honestly say that i've met people like that, annoying and good persons almost at the same time.It's not a great movie, but i can honestly say, i'had some fun.

219,mike_NY,Surprisingly Entertaining,7,23 May 2020,"I wasn't a huge fan of the various SNL star's movies of the 1990s-e.g. David Spade, Rob Schneider, Adam Sandler, etc.-but these days, in comparison to most comedies being made, they are looking like comedy classics. Consequently, ""The Wrong Missy""-produced by Sandler- is simplistically entertaining and maintains its tone and energy for the duration of the pleasantly diverting and short (90 minute) movie.It never tries to be anything else other than what it is: a sorta low budget and lean-but very professionally-produced-basic comedy, with quite a few funny lines and situations. It doesn't overly rely on sight gags and toilet humor...and I don't think there was one gay-panic joke in the entire script-but best of all, David Spade is less snarky than he once was, therefore somewhat more appealing as an everyman.The supporting cast is more than capable and peppered with friends and family of Sandler...such as his wife, daughters, and nephew...as well as other familiar faces from the typical Sandler ensemble.But the real kudos go to Lauren Lapkus, who really had the make or break role in the movie. If one didn't buy into her character, that was that: the end. Too much energy and she would have been so annoying that one would have shut it off: too serious and she would have seemed overly pathetic...or demented. As it was, she was just right and struck a near perfect balance in her characterization...and while she was a caricature (of course she was, look at the team of the movie) it didn't go too far over the line. It kept you guessing throughout: ""is she or is she not redeemable?"" All things considered, this was not a waste of time and was actually pretty good.",The Wrong Missy
220,gjcannon,A Story of the Love-Lauren,3,3 June 2020,"I kept expecting the Mandalorian to appear and put David Spade back in his hovercradle. Spade needs to find sone new kind of role because the idea of this wizened baby Yoda in serial relationships with women well out of his league's not very convincing. The talent here is all in Lauren Lapkus's gross-out inappropriateness and even that is eventually dialled-down to one. Still, it's not my usual fare and lockdown makes us watch some stuff we'd normally avoid so I imagine there are plenty out there who'd enjoy this Sandler school of comedy film even if they do feel they've been transported back to the '90s.",The Wrong Missy

The story does not make sense at all, and its idea is completely unoriginal. Although this movie's genre is comedy, it is the absolute opposite of comedy, it is not funny AT ALL, I did not laugh at all during this film, the humor is just pure crap. The editing and cinematography are basic and does nothing to stand out and is honestly just rubbish. The acting is some of the worst I have seen in weeks, I mean David Spade is honestly just terrible at playing his role, it does not even look authentic, sam thing goes for Lauren Lapkus.

There are some really funny scenes in the first half of the film, but it gradually deteriorates into a farce.I think that Missy's role would have been better understated and a bit more naive than the hyper-extrovert portrayed the film. The film portrays her as a bumbling idiot at first and then later on wants your sympathy. It's hard to switch as a viewer if the character is portrayed superficially as she is.The production quality is good and the movie is enjoyable to some extent but ultimately the lack of sincerity by the lead character (Missy) is a fatal flaw for the whole film.",The Wrong Missy

I just like his whole 'smarmy' attitude and I think he can be very funny. He plays more the straight guy to Lauren Lapkus' over the top comedy, and honestly, it was very fun to watch.Lapkus steals this movie and she was hilarious, gross, and made the movie so much fun. My wife's not a big 'comedy' fan but we were laughing our a**es off through a lot of this movie. 'Bout time as there aren't many good comedies these days.Basically, blind date goes wrong. Then blind date gets dragged out for a full weekend at a work retreat while Spade is competing for a promotion.There're a lot of crude jokes in it and there're a few bits that don't really work (the shadow dance thing ... was kind of the low point and I think it could've been done better), and the mermaid thing.

241,krational-66550,Can the trip go on with the wrong girl,6,20 May 2020,"The first time I saw the hostess, I was a little stunned. Such an annoying, irritating actress could find where to find it. I'll know after a while, Lauren Lapcus This actor who has appeared in more than one hundred movies, this year's new film is also spelled out, saying that it will be a movie.The movie name clearly shows the theme of the movie, which is an oolong event. The male lead Tim met Missy Missy at the airport. The two fell in love with each other. They fell in love at first sight. When he got on the plane, Tim realized that he had made the wrong appointment. It was not the dream lover, but the same name, a blind date. For some reason, the journey began.It has to be said that the plot design is really not satisfactory, the initial boredom, the so-called madman unexpectedly reversed at the end, according to the convention, did not wait for the unexpected plot, a bit panic. There is nothing new about the development of the plot, so be it. Many movies are not won by the plot. Let 's look at other aspects.The heroine, this actor, really fights, starring in such a role. What an anti-human character is it, showing everywhere, out of the ordinary, swearing everywhere, sturdy with a knife on the plane . The screen is full of unbelievable expressions. When I see things that I do n't understand, I am happy to see it happen everywhere. It gives me the impression that the acting is in place. I ca n't blame the actors if they have a low score.If this movie has a little language cleansing, just skip it. A large number of plots driving secretly are not the kind that cannot find evidence. The discussion of a certain topic is directly regarded as a branch of the film.Although there are many cheerful plots, the West is not open to understanding, and the plot is boring and dozing.

The only joke in this movie is the scenario. Theres a main story there, where if you could replace the actors, the dialogues and the stupid events, pretty much just keep the locations, maybe it would be something worth your time.Funny? nope. Amusing? nope. Acting? just bad. Far from believable things happen, where the outcome in a sane world would be totally different. Gene Wilder said in an interview when asked why he doesn't act anymore, that in todays movies they swear so much and for no apparent reason. Well this is probably what he was talking about. And i must admit that some scenes were pretty gross, although you wouldn't expect that from this kind of movie.In a few words, don't waste your time with this one.

Sorry mate, the infantile, attention seeking behaviour of Missy at the beginning is trying too hard to get laughs and is off-putting. There is zero intelligence in this movie and zero care factor for the characters.",The Wrong Missy

I really liked Lauren Lapkus in the later seasons of The Big Bang Theory, so I was curious about her in this. It is a Happy Madison production, so of course many of the gang play small parts, and David Spade as we all know is very hit or miss.So it's an over the top comedy, with a lot of physical comedy with Lauren. Some land, some don't (literally in one case), but I enjoyed it overall. Part of it I think was because it reminded me of when there were more movies like this. Movies that didn't take themselves seriously, some of which didn't work, but some of them really did (Tommy Boy anyone?). I'm not putting it in that stature, but there were nastalgic aspects of when movies were just movies and not platforms to shove an agenda down your throat. It was just good goofy fun with a lot of physical comedy and a tried and true base story of not knowing love was in front of you all along.",The Wrong Missy

The only difference is this time the cringeworthy moments are being delivered by the female lead. Being a Happy Madison film means you know what you'll get, so there are no surprises. Lauren Lapkus does over the top as well as any of Sandler's regular alumni- possibly even better given how naturally the lunacy flows from her. Rob Schneider and David Spade have gotten older and their usual schtick has less energy, but don't all of us after 50? It's a well worn storyline with a bit of massaging to make it just different enough. Boy meets crazy girl, boy tries to ditch crazy girl only to be forced together and ultimately fall for the crazy girl after losing her. It's neither awful nor amazing.

I try not to judge these films too harshly, as movies like Grown Ups, The Do-Over, and many other Happy Madison Comedies always get terrible critic ratings and decent fan ratings. They appeal to their specific audience, and while they're never strong on plot or any other film traits, they make people laugh and they serve their purpose. This movie didn't do that. I maybe laughed once. You could tell they try to change up the typical fall-in-love-with-the-girl-you-never-thought plot a little, but it doesn't work at all. It doesn't make sense, the humor misses way more than it hits, and they treat the audience like they're stupid.

311,aarnold-89747,A movie that had potential but ruined it,3,13 May 2020,"I thought the concept of this movie had a lot of potential. Unfortunately several parts of it were just mediocre, and the rest were down right horrific. The movie was about as predictable as it gets. They just followed a basic rom-com checklist about a guy falling for the girl he initially didn't like. The jokes weren't that funny. I'm pretty sure it's one of those movies that didn't really have a script, they just wanted everyone to improvise all their dialog and interactions. This is fine for the most part, nothing all that funny, but nothing terrible, with the exception of the one biggest downfall of this movie: Lauren Lapkus' role. I don't know where the blame goes; the writers, the director, or Lapkus, or maybe all of the above. But she does not come off as funny at any point in the movie, and every scene she has is pure cringe. And one of the biggest faults in the character is the fact that she is completely deserving of the hate at the beginning of the movie. The way she acts is completely disrespectful, selfish, inconsiderate and there is know reason for anyone to like her or feel sorry for her at all. But that didn't stop them from having her act somewhat normal for 5 minutes, then try to make you feel sad for her when she finds out he made a mistake and asked the wrong girl to join him. Then she runs off acting like she was done wrong, the right girl shows up and even though she's beautiful, smart, and kind, he runs off to chase the woman with no redeeming qualities. It was, overall, just a poor execution of a story that could of had potential to be not too bad. But, it was a Happy Madison movie, so I guess there's not much to be surprised with. They haven't put any real effort into any movie other than trying to ride the Adam Sandler name as long as they could.",The Wrong Missy

There are some scenes where I'm looking at David's reaction to her antics and thinking, THAT'S how I would feel..! Lauren has captured my attention and I'll be looking for her in the future. David has redeemed himself from some of his 'poor' choices in the past. The BEST thing about this movie? Whenever I think of it I find myself smiling and laughing. (And) Isn't That the whole point?

Seeing David Spade and Laura Lapkus on the cast intrigued me to watch it. The first scene was enjoyable as David confused his blind date with someone else they started bikering and out of no where appeared Melissa aka Missy . She was completely over the top and crazy af. She played her character a bit to well and at times it felt like she was over acting but hey her character is a loud -obnoxous, clumsly ,psyhco women that does whatever the f she wants . She appears completely crazy however throughout the film David becomes in love with her after all the embarssing and mind-blowing shes done they become more connected than ever. This move had many funny moments in which I can simply name them one by one but I don't want my fingers to fall off from writing lol.

Okay, okay, the premise is just a vehicle for a series of raunchy set-ups, but still, Spade is playing a guy too old and too boring to not make this a distraction I tried but couldn't ignore in pretty much every scene. He's having sex more often than a pair of recent newlyweds and yet he's not initiating any of it. But I digress. The primary reason I give this four stars is Lauren Lapkus. She carries any scene that works. Rob Schneider and Jackie Sandler do some funny schtick, but neither are actually part of the story. The rest of the characters just show up and go away with no thought as to actually following any of them or resolve any of their ""storylines."" If you are going to watch anything David Spade does or any of the Happy Madison productions, then honestly you're not going to be on imdb reading reviews beforehand.

It's just quirky and kind of funny too. To address some of the haters of the movie about how she assaults him in bed or something. She's there because the main character doesn't tell her that he mistook her for the other girl, so she's under the impression that they're together and states so very clearly when they first meet on the plane. If this was in real life, the guy should say ""actually I didn't invite you and this was a mistake so absolutely not."" And then get off the plane, easy right? But he didn't because the movie is a romance movie and it's not part of the plot, he ends up falling in love with the woman when he realizes everyone around him are washed up cookie cutters.

It is not more than what you can expect from an average cast like this. However I have another point. It is mainly related to my feminist perspective but it is what any civilized person should think. It is really disgusting to see dirty old men chasing young women in the movies. It is not only the age obnoxiousness but the humiliation of women via body-shaming. Movies do not have a mission to create role models for sure but there is no cinematic beauty or any artistic intensity in this movie that can compansate such a wrong presentation.

She knows everything, fix things up and the man falls in love with her! She was too annoying to be loved, with her eyes always wide like she wanted to act in a horror movie.
The worst thing about this movie is the chemistry that doesn't exist between the leads.
And this is just so important when it comes to rom coms ! You wouldn't feel anything about them to the point I somehow wanted him to back to his ex gf.
At least she was normal.

David Spade's wig, which resembled his own hair from his 20's was pretty funny in it's own right and thinking back this may be one if the first movies where a character has an intentionally bad wig without forcing some sort of silly scene where the wig comes off. Lauren Lapkus was incredible despite being subjected to a complete list of things most actors would run from resulting in some of the best physical comedy I've seen in a long time. Another strength was the film's understanding of when to play into the viewers expectations and when to subvert them, helping a fairly ""played out"" idea feel fresh. The only strikingly bad performances were from Jackie and Jared Sandler.

410,Ponky0512,The Wrong Movie,5,27 May 2020,There's some good humour in this rom-com but a lot of it is overplayed or as predictable as the storyline.

435,mule_us,"Entertaining, lighthearted, and very stupid. A nicely done Sandler Production.",7,19 May 2020,"Wrong Missy stands out from the ""Happy Madison"" productions of the past 10 years. That's not saying much, but its a competent comedy flick. The film is propelled by Lauren Lapkus's amazing performance and David Spade's typical awkward and amusing aloofness.The premise is thin, but the cast makes it work. Tim Morris (Spade) goes on an awful (and hysterical) blind date with Missy (Lapkus.) The date includes Missy picking a fight and brandishing weaponry to name a few of the hi-jinks. Tim opts to never see Missy again. A few days later he meets the ""girl of his dreams"", also named Missy. He inexplicably mixes them up in his phone and so we have a barely adequate story platform to deliver some great laughs.The usual comedy character development is kept short and to the point. In that sense this film knows what it is and manages to keep the laughs throughout. This is in large part due to Lauren Lapkus's ability to spin comedy gold out of a facial expression, fully committed punch lines, or a strand of her own hair.Some of the usual suspects make cameos, but few stand out except for Nick Swardson and Rob Schneider. Somehow playing a non-pc Human Resources executive is a perfect and hilarious fit for Swardson. Equally so for Rob Schneider as a lunatic boat captain. They're both in their element.Its not a great movie by any means, but its a return to form for Sandler's production company. If you enjoyed the filthy slapstick humor of Joe Dirt, the Benchwarmers, and Grandma's Boy, the Wrong Missy will not disappoint.",The Wrong Missy

There were enough funny moments that it kept me amused and I even laughed out loud a few times. But you could pretty much see where it was going as soon as they set up the hot Molly Sims character juxtaposed with the cute-enough but not stunning hot mess character of Lauren Lapkus. I'll let you figure out where it goes from there. Sims' Missy falling for Spade's character is a bit of stretch too (though not the real Spade - that guy pulls) further adding to the improbability and making the end even more predictable. Other than that the two principals were great. It was fun to see Rob Schneider pulling off the outrageous Komante character, and I love seeing Sarah Chalke doing some Eliot Reed-style physical comedy.

Laced with Adam Sandler DNA in the form of family cast members and a Sandler-esque flavor of humor the laughs are fast and furious. Yes, the story is formulaic, but the formula does work. Spade delivers a solid performance in his funny, yet semi-romantic role while Lapkus brings a hysterical performance as she redefines the comedic feminine lead.

The idea was interesting, but the execution failed as movies of this type often do. If they took out a lot of the obnoxious, crass, ""edgy"" humour (ahem, non-consensual sex acts disguised as ""jokes""), there could have been a funny movie with a lot of heart. There were a lot of completely pointless characters and and the plot went never really connected.
I am generally a David Spade fan, but his acting was definitely lacking in this one. It felt like he gave zero effort; it didn't help that his character didn't seem fully fleshed out. Most of his scenes were reactions to what other characters were doing or saying. And when I say reactions, I mean shots of him widening his eyes or saying ""oh."" It was like he was a supporting character in his own story.
Lauren Lupkus passed quirky and funny and stopped at just plain obnoxious.
I would have liked to see more of Molly Sims as the introduction to her character was the catalyst for the main plot. Not because I thought her performance was amazing or anything, I just thought a lot of good conflict could have come out of her being more present in the movie. Instead she only reappeared after I had already forgotten she existed.
Sarah Chalke's character was completely pointless. I mean completely pointless.

It has a very strong cast, a well written story, tuns of humour, moments of sadness, action, rebellion, and relatable real life senerraos (with its fair share of farfetched moments).

Whilst David Spade plays the hilariously relatable straight man role and Lauren Lapkus absolutely goes full force into a neurotic tour de France of a mishap instigator, the real star of this show has to be the incredibly talented Bobby Lee.I've watched Bobbys' scenes a few times now, and although I'm unsure of his approach stylistically (method acting, visualising maybe) he truly became his character. In one scene he merely just had to pull a face and it said eveything about what his character was thinking. It was like reading a book in a second and it was mesmerising. His delivery of his line (I won't spoil what he says or at what point of the film he does so) was truly a scene stealer. He clearly had prepared for the role and the dialogue in such a way that for the audience it would have seemed effortless, but in reality had taken years of dedication to his craft.

Lauren Lapkus's character is horrible, unrealistic, and not funny. Who is laughing at this? The character needs to be in a mental hospital or a jail.
If the character was just an annoying unattractive girl that won the heart of David Spade's boss, it would have been funny.
This isn't an annoying unattractive girl, its an insane unhinged person that otherwise would not be allowed in public due to her tendency to hurt herself and others. Then, David Spade's character makes no attempt to correct the situation, he just lets it happen, tries to avoid her while she keeps crashing his company events.

If you're looking for a slick 90's style romcom, or you're someone who's not satisfied unless you've found something to be offended by, this is not for you. The basic premise could have applied to a slick 90's romcom. Middle aged guy has a disastrous blind date, later meets a possible soulmate, can't believe his luck, tries to invite her on a work retreat (wish we had something like that in the UK) and finds to his horror that he's inadvertently invited the nightmare of the same name. What ensues isn't PC. It's at times charmless, cringeworthy, even slightly juvenile. Lauren Lapkus, barring one particular scene when she opens up about her life, is quite annoying. In the end, love wins the day after all seems lost, and one or two unsavoury characters get taken down.

This is my first review here in the IMDB. I really liked this film. It has something nice new touches and felt the strange, but nice chemistry between the head actor and actress. This humor really catch me.

From the opening scene I was pretty sure I wasn't going to enjoy The Wrong Missy, but I'd heard/read it was funny and entertaining, so I stuck with it. It never got funny or entertaining.
The plot was interesting; execution was horrible. The casting was confusing. None of the actors seemed the right fit for their characters. Especially David Spade. I just could not see him as a wildly successful businessman with 3 women madly in love with him. He didn't pull it off well at all. It was as if someone owed him a favor, so they gave him the leading role in this movie.
The Wrong Missy was hard to watch without being completely annoyed and feeling somewhat uncomfortable at how pathetic the characters are. I know Happy Madison and Netflix could have done so much better than this. They should just call this one a write-off and try harder next time. Please don't waste your time.

You enter the arena with a light heart and a stupid grin on your face (or maybe a dire need to cheer the.. 'hell' up). And within half an hour of the movie, if you haven't gained an appreciation for Lupkus's performance, maybe you need to take a leaf out of 'Missy's' book, quit your job, get out of your toxic marriage and live a little. This is an absolutely brilliant film for what it's supposed be. The only regret I have about this movie is that I don't get a little high before I watched it, to really.. exaggerate the experience.

641,beth-30891,Great if you like nonconsensual sex and suicide jokes...,1,14 May 2020,"Going in I did not have high expectations for this movie, but I thought it would at least be an easy watch with maybe a few laughs. However, this movie was just cringeworthy from start to finish and managed to be both extremely annoying and offensive. I will start with the most egregious: This movie contains two instances of nonconsensual sex acts. First on the plane, Missy essentially roofies Tim and performs a sexual act on him while he's sleeping. Second, in the hotel room she starts intercourse with Tim while he's sleeping again. Finally, while some jokes just didn't land, other's were extremely cruel and distasteful. Tim's character decides not to tell Missy about the mistake he made in inviting her on the trip because he thinks she is suicidal, and he doesn't want to ""push her over the edge."" When he tells his co-worker Nate this, Nate then jokes about suicide claiming, ""Who are we to get in the way of destiny? If her time's up then her time's up. She's spirit world,"" while throwing up a peace sign to the sky. I was shocked this was included, especially due to the fact that David Spade's sister-in-law, Kate Spade, recently committed suicide. Less egregious and just annoying is Missy's character. She is way over the top with no redeeming qualities. It seems like she has an actual personality disorder that needs medical attention. It would be more acceptable if she started out over the top and annoying and gradually softened as the movie progressed, but this was not the case. She comes off as obnoxious until the end with no character growth. Her behavior isn't cute, fun, or quirky, and there is no chemistry between Tim and Missy, which makes the conclusion very unbelievable. To say the least, I was not surprised when the credits rolled, and I saw that this movie was written, directed, and produced by men (which also explains the unnecessary inclusion of a botched threesome scene with Tim's ex-fiancee)...",The Wrong Missy
