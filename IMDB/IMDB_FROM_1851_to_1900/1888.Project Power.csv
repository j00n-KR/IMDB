0,nogodnomasters,What is your power?,7,1 September 2020,"The government is testing a new drug in New Orleans. It brings out dormant animal DNA in people and gives them power. The power varies from person to person and some die when they take it. The effects lasts oddly enough for exactly 5 minutes to the second for everyone. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jamie Foxx, and Dominique Fishback team up to save the world, for now.It was an interesting drug film in New Orleans, one without Nicholas Cage. Apparently the drug immediately enters the drug stream and reacts. Animals evolved many of their abilities after they separated from our evolutionary branch, yet we somehow have that in our DNA. Don't think too hard.Guide: No sex or nudity. Caught 1 F-word.",Project Power
1,kosmasp,Assault .. on your senses,9,11 October 2020,"In a good way I would say. I mean visually this is just stunning. Talking cinematography, editing and effects, which come together to be such a treat. I understand if some may have reservations about the story (which admittedly is quite thin), but overall it is one thing: fun. As is the whole movie, while still packing more than just one punch.The action is great too and having actors like Jamie Foxx and Gordon Levitt in it ... they speak for themselves, but the girl who's the other lead matches their performances and their intensity - easily! If you like to be entertained and like Science Fiction inspired stories (I didn't actually stop to think about what makes sense or not, the movie has quite the pace to it, which helps of course) - this is for you",Project Power
2,Sleepin_Dragon,It filled a gap.,6,15 August 2020,"Number one in the UK, the number of times I've fallen for that one. Project Power is not going to be a film that will live you for days, you won't want to buy it on blu ray or collect memorabilia. However, if you want almost two hours of pretty well made nonsense, then you may just enjoy this, I'm not a huge lover of this particular genre, so perhaps I'm not the best judge, but I didn't switch it off, or skip through it, so that's a positive.The story is very much x men territory, with some modern day drug problems thrown into the mix, Jamie Foxx is good value as always.It is entertaining enough, but has b movie vibes, 6/10.",Project Power
3,CinemaSerf,It's a pity the pill couldn't invigorate the script!,6,15 August 2020,"A pill is doing the rounds that gives it's users unique - unpredictable - superpowers for five minutes. When it starts to fall into the hands of the criminal fraternity, crime starts to spiral and it falls to local cop Joseph Gordon-Levitt (""Frank"") to try and arrest this lawlessness. He hooks up with a small time dealer ""Robin"" (Dominique Fishback) and, eventually, with former soldier Jamie Foxx (""Art"") to track down those creating and pushing this lethal chemical. This is quite an interesting concept that probably could have merited a 50 minute one-off drama. At 10 minutes shy of two hours, however, it is just far too thin to sustain any great interest; the characterisations are shallow and the dialogue and scenarios straight out of a comic book. Fishback isn't half bad, but her onscreen persona is irritating, and what action there is is all just a bit too staged and contrived. Another from the Netflix churn factory...",Project Power
4,siderite,I can't stop the feeling that it could have been something grander,7,16 August 2020,"Imagine Code 8 having a baby with Bright and you get this film. It is a movie where people get superpowers by ingesting a fancy new pill that shadowy forces are peddling on the street. We watch a version of the Punisher trying to get to his daughter joining forces with a cop who wants to get his city clear of this new menace while the authorities have been bought and paid for and with a girl rapper poor and caught in the middle of it all. The only chance is to take matters into their own hands. Now, as an action movie with a sci-fi premise it was pretty OK, but I can't shake the sensation that it had the potential for something greater. As such, it is pretty formulaic and I really can't put the finger on what could have done differently, but the feeling sticks.Perhaps the edginess of Foxx's character is what was weird, a guy who can threaten young girls with violence, murder people left and right just because they are in the way and so on, but in the end just being the good guy, consequences free. Or maybe the whole Black poor girl having to peddle drugs on the street because the world is against her, which riffs on a toxic stereotype and the Black Lives Matter movement at the same time. Or perhaps on the good White cop who takes the drug so he can fight the drug and the corruption. There was a lot of moral grayness that did not got resolved in any way in the script.Bottom line: do not expect anything revolutionary from this film. Just enjoy the tensions and the fancy glowing skin effects.",Project Power
5,FeastMode,surprisingly not awful,5,24 April 2021,"I really expected nothing from this. But it was miles ahead of the usual trash that netflix produces. It's not good. It's filled with flaws. But i was amused. Mildly entertained throughout. Never felt bored, and never wanted to speed it up. It was stupidly enjoyable (1 viewing, 4/23/2021)",Project Power
6,Edvis-1997,8,8,15 January 2021,"First of all, it's way underrated. We're talking about 2020 movies. There are only few movies at all it stands way better than Wonder Woman 1984. I've really enjoyed watching it, visuals and effects were the best of 2020, no doubts. I didn't necessary enjoyed MGK in this movie but overall idea wasn't boring, plot was going in straight line. Top 10 movie of 2020.",Project Power
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The power within.,7,16 August 2020,"Yet another spin on superheros, 'Project Power (2020)' posits a world in which a new drug allows users to unleash their inner power - whatever it may be - for five minutes a pop. It's an interesting premise that, essentially, takes a traditional action-thriller and sprinkles some of the oh-so-popular superhero genre on top. It may sound cynical, but it doesn't feel it. It's generally an enjoyable time, despite its uneven tone and somewhat vague plot. It also has a few stand-out set-pieces which are approached in rather unique ways, such a hectic fight sequence that's only seen from inside a giant tank. The leads all do a good job with the material - though, Gordon-Levitt seems to think he's in a comedy - and the pacing is always tight enough to maintain engagement. It isn't going to get you thinking - in fact, you'll probably notice some plot problems if you do - but it should keep you entertained. 7/10",Project Power
8,Cineanalyst,A Bad Rap: Superhero Movies as Drugs,5,15 August 2020,"I'm not sure how I feel about a superhero movie referencing Batman and Robin when that movie co-stars Robin (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012)) in another role and features an unrelated character (played by Dominique Fishback) also named Robin. Regardless, the concept of ""Project Power"" really does get at the crux of what's the matter with superhero movies; I'll give it that. Our culture is popping these things like the pills from ""Limitless"" (2011) these days--all for a fleeting high, to consume and distract with its momentary sense of animalistic invincibility. Some burn brightly for a time before drowning, or may be briefly bulletproof, others seem nearly invisible among all the other contenders, while still others simply bomb. Unfortunately, though, most of the rest of the narrative in this supernaturally-powered fix is worthlessly hackneyed. There's the father (Jamie Foxx) with ""a very particular set of skills"" searching for his taken daughter, the teenager slinging the dope to support her sick mother, and a diminutive and white Luke Cage as a cop trying to clean up his corrupt city's streets. The city this time is New Orleans, which provides an opportunity for parallels to Hurricane Katrina that are never well developed and seeming struggles to make work a pun out of the city's ""Superdome"" stadium. The only promising material in all of this isn't found in the superpowers, but with the teenage dealer's, Robin's, rapping.A lot of these comic-book-type movies feature such meta narratives--part of the story being about the construction of the story. Clark Kent and Lois Lane are journalists for a newspaper that reports on Superman. The Green Hornet owns the rag that tells his story. Peter Parker snaps pictures of Spiderman's wrist-snapping for a tabloid, which is also why I think his last movie, ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019) is one of the best of its kind, as the photographer's nemesis there is a visual-effects technician in a battle for control of the web-slinger's story and public image. Even Netflix's last superhero feature, ""The Old Guard"" (2020), had a team of supes whose immortality wrote history--even if all of it was disappointingly reduced to a guy's crazy board. And so it is here, as Robin not only provides the others their superpowers by selling them the pills, but she also tells of those powers through rap. On the plus side, this gives us a mid-credits scene that actually compliments that plot, of the character as the writer of the very movie she's in, without selling us a proposed sequel or making a stupid joke. Yet, just taking a word to construct an entire superhero movie doesn't necessarily make for much of a rhyme.Soundtracks have become increasingly important in the genre, to the point that music has become the meta narrative. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2004) incorporated its pop score into scenes via Starlord's Walkman. Netflix's ""The Umbrella Academy"" series did similarly its first season, including with its main character being a violinist. And so we have a rapper, here, in a movie with a cast featuring musicians (Foxx, Colson Baker, even Gordon-Levitt, apparently) and a score with some rap and other popular music. Unfortunately, they don't compliment the visuals very well. The MCU standard has the supes fighting--sometimes in long takes--to such tunes, but ""Project Power"" has few such scenes, and the music isn't prominent or relevant in the ones it does have. Instead, we get Foxx wrestling with CGI in one and posing with it in another, while someone must think photographing Gordon-Levitt from behind as he runs down a corridor carrying a shotgun looks cool because he did the same thing, among other similarities between the two roles, in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Oh well, at least ""Project Power"" satisfies that superhero movie fix for now.",Project Power
9,ops-52535,its a rush,6,14 August 2020,"On sugar pills entertainment, but its a flippy floppy quality technical production, with lots of incoherence and a more bold than perfect on the plain things that makes a film a ''good'' film. there are big flaws in the sound production, and the use of score with a volume button turning up and down each time there are dialouges are cheap and unescesarry. the sound management has forgotten how much noise a moving ship makes. and the calmity of the calamity make the silence airpinning irritating. also the editing has its issues, and the plot dives headless back and forth.the acting are following the directors commands and very scriptous, not much freestyling here. the extras panicking do have a low standardto the positive, lots of great special effects and the fruitful light and coloration are faboulous but thats merely it, and its of course positive that the grumpy old man hung on to the end, but its a neat beacon in a rather dark pandemic season so enjoy, its recommendable entertainment.",Project Power

11,Thanos_Alfie,Good to spend your time...,6,18 June 2021,"""Project Power"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie in which we watch an ex-soldier, a police officer and a teenage dealer trying to stop a group of people from delivering a pill that gives to users unpredictable powers. They have to cooperate and trust each other if they want to succeed.I found this movie interesting but not something amazing or new since there are plenty Sci-Fi movies which have to do with superpowers and a way of gaining those. The interpretations of both Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played as Frank and Jamie Foxx who played as Art were good and the combination of them worked very well. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Dominique Fishback who played as Robin. All in all, I have to say that ""Project Power"" is a nice movie to spend your time with but if you are about to watch it, I advise you to lower your standards otherwise you will be disappointed by it.",Project Power
12,cruise01,Delivers the action and thrills but a messy direction with its sub plot and characters.,7,16 August 2020,"Project Power (3.5 out of 5 stars).Project Power is a pretty fair superhero film that has some exciting and thrilling action but poor direction and characters. I feel like the film could have been something more with its concept and story. But the duo directors who were also behind on the movie Nerve. Which they do focus on a theme of corrupt police and government. Who are experimenting on people. The low poverty with the high crime rate.The plot follows Art (Jamie Foxx), Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and Robin (Dominique Fishback) who are trying to stop a drug dealer and corruption from releasing a drug that gives people power for 5 mins. Which some people take advantage of causing crimes and some using it to stop the criminals.Art has his own agenda who are trying to stop the organization thats releasing these pills. Frank is trying to stop bad guys but uses the pills to give him strength. Robin a high school student and informant that helps Frank in finding these drugs. The film does lose its track with its direction with the boring sub plot with Robin trying to be a free ball rapper. Which she free raps randomly in a classroom which is cringy and terrible. I feel like the film could have trim some of its weak sub plots with these characters which distracts away from the main storyline.The action sequences are good and entertaining. The music score works with the tone. The visual effects are cheaply put together.Overall, Project Power is a pretty fair film. Action is good. Story could have been more. The script is mixed with its uneven tone with the characters and sub plot. The movie could have been worse.",Project Power
13,eddie_baggins,"A great concept, cast and setting are wasted on a lifeless offering",2,18 August 2020,"Oh Netflix, why have you done this to us again?How do you keep throwing money to the wind on original high-concept projects that seem on paper like a perfect opportunity to create popcorn/guilty pleasure good times but end up being mind-numbingly bad/downright boring outings that seriously make the viewer question where the money and sense went in the final product.Continuing on an horrifically bad trend of recent original Netflix outings that may rate highly in viewership figures but low in the minds of anyone that would care to remember them past a few minutes post credits (here's looking at you Extraction and The Old Guard), Henry Joost's and Ariel Schulman's great sounding Project Power is a complete waste of talent, time and the $85 million dollar plus budget it was allocated to be born into existence.Cutting their teeth with the wonderfully marketed documentary (that is highly likely to be a narrative film in disguise) Catfish and getting some box office runs on the board with a couple of forgettable Paranormal Activity entries, Joost and Schulman seem like capable enough directors and their cast includes the endlessly charismatic Jamie Foxx and the always likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt but Project Power is a seriously dull affair without an ounce of magic.With the bare bones nature of the story centering around an illegal street drug that gives those that take it a few minutes of powerful abilities (inc. flaming body, bullet resistance, Hulk like transformations) and Foxx's Art and Levitt's cop Frank trying to stop it from reaching the wrong hands as well as deal with the feisty street smart tag-along Robin (played by upcoming star Dominique Fishback), there's a sense that Project Power could be a new over the top riot but thanks to a dire script from upcoming Batman writer Mattson Tomlin, some nausea inducing camerawork from Michael Simmonds (swinging your camera around every chance you get doesn't make the film you're shooting anymore awesome) and a plot line that fails to utilize its idea or colorful setting of New Orleans to great effect, this is a film that you wish would hurry up and conclude well before its yawn-fest of a finale takes place.Another huge failure from the film is keeping Foxx and Levitt apart for a large portion of the films runtime, if anyone was able to potentially make this film seem better than it in fact is it was up to these two performers who have proven to be capable of elevating projects they're a part of but with bare bones backstories or barely an ounce of character growth or depth to their characters, not even these proven commodities could save this latest streaming bomb.Final Say -Sure to appease those easy to please Netflix viewers looking for some mindless distractions whilst browsing their mobile phones, but for anyone else, Project Power is the newest Netflix stinker that like usual wastes a talented cast, a significant budget and a great idea on a final product that is both instantly forgettable and highly disappointing.1 Gleason guernsey out of 5",Project Power
14,Tweetienator,Just Nope,4,17 August 2020,"The typical Netflix recipe for a movie/show: pro production (cam, setting etc.), some known actors, and an average script (not talking about the idea or concept but about the execution). Target: produce something to fill screen-time and to feed the money-making machine. I would not say that Project Power is a total fail or wreck, but it is one of those meaningless, mediocre movies, you will forget quickly.

15,digitalbeachbum,Not as good as it could have been,3,17 August 2020,"One of the turn offs for this production is the pill. Watching some one have to not only swallow the pill, but turn it? then it makes a sound? And it looks like there is a tiny galaxy inside it? Talk about ruining the mood. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.There is nothing wrong with the acting, the casting is good, the cinematography too. The special effects are hit or miss, some are awesome, some are terrible. The script is off as well the directing.The idea of stealing some essence from a person and then using it to make ""juice"" to give temporary super powers is nothing new. Bad Boys for example, on Amazon already has this but it isn't in pill form. There are other stories with the same premise. So no kudos on originality.Other than this, it was worth a one time watch. However, this isn't going to win any awards. There is nothing special about this movie.",Project Power

18,Vartiainen,"Cool premise, average execution",6,12 October 2020,"New Orleans, modern day. A new drug is moving through the streets. A pill that will give your superpowers for five minutes. The only catch being, you don't know which superpower you'll end up with.Superb idea! Absolutely fantastic! Unfortunately what we end up with is a pretty average buddy cop action thriller where a group of unlikely heroes will track down a villainous villain - all that's missing is the moustache twirling - and ruin their evil plot through the magic of (*cough*friendship*cough*) teamwork.To the film's credit, it has some really topnotch visual effects going for it. Every time a superpower is utilized, it's at the very least visually interesting, if not outright breathtaking. That being said, the film has this strange notion going for it where it claims that all these superpowers are derived from abilities seen in the animal kingdom. Yet we have a guy who can set himself on fire and a chick who can freeze herself solid. Sure, derived from the animal kingdom... Whatever you say.This could have been a real solid film. Drop the animal kingdom horse dung, focus on the cool superpowers, keep Jamie Foxx in lead role, perhaps drop the idea that the antagonist has to have this ""take over the world"" masterplan. This could have been a really cool sleeper hit of a movie. Alas, what we end up getting is plenty entertaining, but also plenty brainless.It's a good popcorn flick.

It helps in giving us more diversity in the Superhero genre.Someone already said that they felt this work to be Generic with Generic characters. I don't fully agree with that. Project Power is filled with some typical movie archetypes but being in a movie about super powers does freshen that up. It's not like we have not seen an X-Men or X-Men-like movie before, but it does bring something different to the table when the cast majority is black. Hell, even having New Orleans as a backdrop brings an atmosphere that puts a spark in what I've just scene.Jamie Fox is a wonderful actor but not really wonderful in everything that he does. This is one of the cases where Fox is at his very best, and in full use of his charm. Joseph Gordan-Levitt is another guy who has a great screen presence and it was cool to see these two do a movie together.The special effects were cool enough to make certain powers look exceptionally coolI really liked what I saw here.

A pretty descent sci-fi action thriller, feeling like a graphic novel brought to the big screen.

22,alindsay-al,A Below Average Missed Opportunity,4,16 August 2020,"So the newest film on Netflix came out on Friday called Project Power and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a new drug sweep New Orleans that gives people the chance to have superhuman powers for 5 minutes, an ex soldier, cop and former drug dealer have to team up and stop it.Main Character
Jamie Foxx plays the lead character here and he is easily the best part of the film. He is pretty charismatic and adds the drama to the film. He is the only character with an arc and story in the film and it allows him to stand out above the others in this film.Supporting Characters
Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the cop here and he is fine, he basically gets by the fact that he is a really good actor, because his character doesn't really exist here. Dominique Fishback plays plays the ex drug dealer and I wasn't a fan of her character, she just didn't have much depth to her and it felt like she was basically just here as a plot device. The villains here are really bland and truly dull, there is nothing interesting there and it is lacking here.Story
The story is incredibly generic, you can predict everything that is going to happen and there is no real twists and turns in the film. The idea of the film is great, but it is executed poorly and the plot feels like an afterthought compared to the visuals of the film.Script
The script is also really average, there is nothing to stand out. It lacks the great drama and intensity but also the bit of humour required. It drops pretty forced pop culture references but they just don't hold up in this film.Style
The style is a mixed bag, it is really cool seeing these different powers on show and how they is used is a real highlight here and well done. But this film is lacking in the action department, especially the hand to hand combat where it is really shaky and pretty hard to follow.Overall
Overall, this film wastes a really interesting idea. It is a really forgettable film and a real misfire as it could have been so much better.",Project Power

28,masonfisk,PROBLEMS W/THIS PROJECT...!,3,7 September 2020,"A recent Netflix original starring Jamie Foxx & Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Imagine a world where a normal human being can achieve superhuman abilities (for a five minute window) by taking a pill. That's the premise in this New Orleans set scifi/action caper where Gordon-Levitt, a rogue cop partners w/a smart aleck drug dealer (who's pushing the aforementioned power drug & supplies him on occasion) to fight crime but when Foxx rolls into town (he being a former military man looking for his kidnapped daughter), the power behind the drugs asserts itself leading to some very violent set pieces CGI'd to the nines. What lets this effort down is its boneheaded plotting, annoying side character (Dominique Fishback) who is a drug dealer w/a heart of gold & an annoying penchant for being a dope rapper (or is that a rap doper?) & unremarkable villains who think wearing the right garb or impressively trimmed goatees & scars will be enough for audiences to cheer when they're offed. I disagree. If you need your action/superhero mash-up, stick w/Code 8 (also on Netflix) which tells a better story w/a tenth of this film's budget. The only surprise here was finding out the directors (thanks to the guys at Double Toasted for the info) are the ones behind the Catfish doc (& subsequent MTV series) who do a pretty good job (especially if you turn off the volume). Co-starring Rodrigo Santoro as one of the bad guys, Machine Gun Kelly as a drug dealer & Courtney B. Vance (wasted here!) as Gordon-Levitt's commander.",Project Power
29,questl-18592,Project Runaway,4,24 January 2021,"I am usually a sucker for a good superhero/metahuman story. I loved comics back in the day, am in love with the marvel universe now and am generally just all about the modern mythos of superheroes. So when I see Netflix has an original with a fresh take on the whole concept with Jamie Fox and JGL at the helm? Yes please.Unfortunately, I think Project Power falls into the same trap of films like Hancock. The concept is fascinating and I want to see more of that but the actual delivery, the storytelling is so underwhelming here. There's a pill that gives everyone a random (specific to them though) power for a short period of time after taking it and this pill is out on the streets. A narcotics/superhuman arms race? Again, yes please. But it's just so sloppy feeling at times. I weirdly think this would work better as a series, perhaps even an anime where these ideas and concepts could be more throughly explored and fleshed out. In this short format it just felt like a mess.I would give this a perfectly middling rating but it felt just a little too preachy to me at times and that's a huge pet peeve of mine and I've got to knock points off for that. That leaves Project Power feeling like a lot of flash but not anywhere near enough substance, especially compared to how much it seems to think it has. It's not a horrible watch and would probably be a solid background flick but it's not cohesive enough for your full attention.",Project Power

Shame that said teenager is totally charisma-free and just as attractive as Combo from the sorely missed Breaking Bad.G-L and Foxx are little more than baits in a silly plot about a super drug distributed by evil white people to conquer the world...Most of the movie takes place by night, but it ain't Collateral and the third act - an endless series of fights and CGI - takes place on a boat, but it ain't The Usual Suspect either. As mentioned, all the baddies are of one ethnicity (except the bait G-L) and all the goodies are the other. Patronizing, cliche-ridden, predictable and totally derivative.",Project Power
31,valleyjohn,The script writers should have taken a pill.,6,16 August 2020,"Netflix original action movies are becoming all too predictable. The have one or two big stars in lead roles , they look fantastic and they nearly always end up being totally unremarkable and that's exactly the case with Project Power .There's a new pill on the streets that gives you superpowers for five minutes. It can make you strong, it can make you invisible, give you super strength or bulletproof skin, but you won't know what superpower you'll get until you try it. A local cop and an ex-soldier with a vendetta team up to get the pills off the street using the only way they know how: by taking the pill.This is a perfectly watchable movie. I enjoyed myself while watching it and I liked the premise even though it wasn't original but I couldn't help but think that it's predictability was its downfall.I wanted some edge to the film. A twist maybe ? But all I got was a nuts and bolts super hero light adventure that lacked a punch .Jamie Foxx was good as was Joseph Gordon - Levitt but maybe the unsung star of this was Dominique Fishback . I have to admit I've never heard of her before .This won't stay too long in the memory , I just wish the script writers would have taken on of those pills then maybe , just maybe this would have been a great film.",Project Power

33,jadepietro,One Pill Makes You Happy...,8,20 August 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite its excesses in violent mayhem, this is an energized action movie about drug-enhanced superheroes that has a strong cast and some nifty CGI.JIM'S REVIEW: Who doesn't want to be a superhero? That's the premise behind Project Power, a nifty action thriller. There is a new drug on the street that can do just that, although one of its side effects is a slight headache and some self-implosion. Still, lots of people want to know its supplier and source for a plethora of reasons.At the head of the list is Ray aka The Major (Jamie Foxx), a mysterious vigilante on a personal mission and Frank Shaver, one seriously flawed New Orleans cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) trying to stop this crime wave of drug-enhanced criminals. Add to that group a teenage street-smart dealer (a scene-stealing Dominque Fishback) and this crime-fighting team is complete.The movie, co-directed with flair by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, is loaded with action sequences that keep the kinetic pacing moving briskly. The directors deftly mix humor and tension as they stage the many chases and standard bloody hand-to-hand combat. The screenplay by Mattson Tomlin, wisely keeps its characters and their motives obscured as it slowly unravels its plot and the interconnections between the main trio of characters is always entertaining. This helps to keep the moviegoer more involved with the storyline. As the film progresses, the narrative does not mesh as well as it could...a few more rewrites of the script could have solved that issue. It all leads to a far-fetched but totally satisfying climax with enough fights and explosions to please action fans.Production values are top-notch with mostly superior CGI. Michael Simmonds' cinematography adds to the gritty nightlife atmosphere with his well-lit dramatic colors and dark shadows. The stunt-work is impressive. Strong editing by Jeff McEvoy and music by Joseph Trapanese effectively adds the needed tension as well.Both Mr. Foxx and Mr. Gordon-Levitt are fine in their roles. They make their written characters more intriguing with their signature heroic screen personas, cementing their action figure status as they wrying trade tongue-in-cheek one-liners. As the central baddies, Rodrigo Santoro and Amy Landecker do not achieve the level of menace that would give the movie more gravitas. Their few scenes never establish the suspense or excitement and that seriously undercut the film's impact. Their characters seem like water-downed villains in search of some depth. Actually Colson Baker as Newt, in a minor supporting role, would have been a far more compelling nemesis.Project Power is more entertaining than most superhero fantasy movies. Its real power is in its engaging cast and the many well-directed action scenes that make this thriller so much fun.",Project Power

39,arungeorge13,Another could-have-been-better actioner from Netflix! [+52%],5,15 August 2020,"Project Power doesn't have much going for it in terms of plot or thematic originality. It draws obvious inspiration from films like 'Limitless' and 'Lucy' in its ""develop crazy new abilities using drugs"" plot and some of the yesteryear superhero flicks in its set pieces. Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the director duo whose best effort remains their debut 'Catfish', pick a generic sci-fi one-liner and try to make a decent actioner out of it. The effort is decent alright, but both plotwise and actionwise, Project Power doesn't have much recall value.In New Orleans, the lives of a narc (played by JGL), a teenage drug dealer (Dominique Fishback), and a man (Jamie Foxx) in pursuit of his kidnapped daughter, get intertwined in predictable ways. What brings them together is a special kind of pill - one that lets people gain superhuman abilities for five minutes when popped. Very soon, they realize that they have a common enemy in a large corporate honcho and her unhinged thugs. It all plays out exactly the way you expect in a typical summer blockbuster.The set-pieces do evoke memories of The Human Torch and Mr. Fantastic from F4, The Incredible Hulk from The Avengers, and The Invisible Man from well... The Invisible Man. To sum it up, there's very little novelty to boast of. Tackled a little differently, Project Power could have actually been a solid body-horror flick (hint: ""Upgrade""). Apparently, a lot of efforts have gone into creating practical effects along with the usual CGI. Darn, knowing that only makes it worse. The potential was certainly there, you see. As far as 2020 actioners from Netflix are concerned, this one's below The Old Guard and Extraction in my books.I wouldn't entirely write it off though. There's an amusing in-between stretch where Foxx makes Fishback rap while they're at a vet clinic (this girl can spit bars real good!). Also, the better set-piece among the entire lot, happens midway through the film.",Project Power

It's a pretty straightforward narrative that it doesn't wastes its time introducing much of its world. The characters are a bit flesh out with distinct personalities and clear motives. The story is a bit familiar but it's well paced and entertaining. The performances are pretty good, Jamie Foxx is excellent as the broken dad who would do anything to find his daughter, Joseph Gordon Levitt is superb and Dominique Fishback is also quite memorable. The action sequences are intensely shot and very entertaining. The camera-work is slick and the overall cinematography gives the film a colder, gritty look. Soundtrack is quite catchy and some of the songs will even get you grooving along with them, the original background score complements the scene nicely as well.

MGK was cool too, though not in the movie too long. It had its fun moments, with basically Foxx in the driver's seat.

43,Prashast_Singh,Totally enjoyed it.,10,14 August 2020,"I can now say that the wait was worth it. Netflix has delivered another cool action entertainer called Project Power, with Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback in the lead roles. Trust me, I started watching the film some time after it was available, and I didn't realize when time flew by so quickly. There were absolutely no slow parts, and the film was studded with cool action sequences and impressive visual effects. The story had a nice sense of urgency due to which it kept me captivated till the end.Project Power is a fresh superhero movie where the ""superheroes"" are not defined by their costumes but their powers. It moves at a brisk pace, and also features a cool soundtrack: watch out for ""My word is my power"". It's really cool and fits the overall theme well. Then you have impressive performances from all actors, which is another plus. The editing must be lauded as it makes everything seem nicely done. The story as a whole is quite refreshing, and the execution is top notch. It's also not too dark, as a matter of fact, balanced by some subtle humor.The fight sequences are breathtaking, especially the ones in the third act. There are a few moments when the camera moves too much during the action, something not everyone might like, but it overall adds a necessary chaotic feel as per the writing. I must say I'm impressed a lot, as for some reason, the film surpassed my expectations. Project Power is meant to be fun and it is. Undoubtedly one of the best action movies of the year.",Project Power

45,NijazBaBs,"too much action, unrealism, extremes",6,23 February 2021,"This is movie is good because of the topic - potential use of drugs to enhance genetic evolutionary abilities or advantages. Then of smaller realistic inspirational and motivational real life events, like our personal and unique wishes, skills, dreams, inspirations, motivations. Then some level of relationships such as between cop and a cop, father and daughter, cop and new friend. Then nice presence of stunts, graphics, science, tricks. But compared to some better movies like Terminator, Resident Evil, Spiderman, there is too much action, lasts too long, too complicated, too much unexplained, and makes us tired, and boring for some moments. Too typical too much all at once extreme fighting events. I prefer much less action, content, exposure, and more mystery, quality, explanation. The science part is not explained fully or not at all, but most stuff looks like it is more about showing what movie creators can do to make something look as extreme and as crazy as possible. Story is rushed, unclear, unrealistic, too fast. Can't be compared to Ghost Rider and Replicas movies, where story is more clear, focused, and makes sense. Here intentions are unclear and most stuff is appearing just like that, without reason or purpose. Not that interesting.",Project Power
46,blott2319-1,Neat idea but dull movie,5,21 August 2020,"I wanted to like Project Power, because the idea of a drug that can give people superpowers is a lot of fun. I also thought the fact that people didn't know what superpower they might have until they took the drug was fascinating. Yet it felt like the cool idea was all that the writer was good for, and someone else needed to adapt that into a much better script. This movie devolves from all that potential into a basic buddy cops versus drug dealers story. Yes, there is the occasional superpower springing up, but they never do anything all that interesting with any of the powers. It's strength, fire, stretchiness, and all that same old nonsense we've seen before in countless other superhero movies. And, most of the time, that just means that the style of the fights will be a little different, while the central storyline lacked anything original or interesting. It followed by the numbers in such a way that I was getting a little bored with it all.It's worth mentioning that the cast is trying hard to redeem Project Power. I was particularly delighted that they kept Dominique Fishback around, because she's easily the most interesting character in the film, and delivers a great performance. Jamie Foxx is good, but a little flat and one-note. They probably hurt his performance by revealing too early that he wasn't a bad guy, because I think some of his early scenes could read as more menacing if we didn't know he was a loving father looking for his daughter. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is given basically no character to work with other than ""cop who uses the drug to help him defeat the bad guys."" He has no back story, no motivation, nothing else other than a job title. There are some good scenes in Project Power, in particular the directors know how to shoot action on a budget. I thought there was some inventive shot selection that made the fights look different and yet just as exciting. I only wish each good scene wasn't countered with a stupid or predictable scene. I wouldn't say Project Power is a disaster, but theres a reason I don't think Netflix ever planned a theatriical release for this film, because it pales in comparison to most other superhero movies we've seen in recent years.",Project Power

The twist is that everyone's power is different: some are fantastic other are self destructive.
The only way to find out is to take the pill.This is a dumb action movie with a veneer of sci-fi to make things interesting.
That is not a criticism - it knows what it is and walks (for the most part) proudly in its shoes.The two main action heroes and the spunky street-kid blaze around town chasing bad guys and elbowing them in the face.
Every now and then a bad guy will pop a pill and we get treated to a fight with a human torch or a super ninja.This is all handled very well with likeable characters and exciting action sequences and things that go boom.The film explains how the pill functions, in the same way you'd explain to a six year old how Santa Claus squeezes down a billion chimney in one night - with about the same results.There are some character sequences that I guess are designed to be impowering but, for me, they reached that level of cringyness where I wanted to peel my face my skull - but they were obviously not aimed at me and I am not a massive rap fan, perhaps I just didn't get it.

53,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While not without it's lack of substance, Project Power is a decent enough superhero film",7,14 August 2020,"In New Orleans, a distribution group create a bunch of pills that can give each person superhero abilities and deadlier reactions. Meanwhile, a teenage dealer named Robin, a local cop named Art, and an ex soldier named Frank must team up to save the cop's daughter and take down the people who created the pills.Upon hearing of the title of the movie and the fact that Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Levitt were starring in it, I watched the whole thing this morning and what I got was actually pretty decent. It's not a perfect movie, sure, but it has some good elements in it.Now there are some problems I do have with the film. The story does deliver on the action, but the execution leaves something to be desired mostly due to the whole idea of pills giving you superhero abilities not being fleshed out enough. Plus the villains are very one-dimensional. Not the actors themselves, but the way they were written and they were underdeveloped. Also, the side characters haven't been given much to do.That being said, everything else is really good. The action sequences are really superbly intense and gripping, the pacing's very good, the music score from Joseph Trapanese (who did the music scores for the Divergent sequels) fits the atmosphere and does it job, and the cinematography along with the special effects look really nice, but the best part would have to go to the acting. Everyone involved did a good job the best coming from Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Dominique Fishback is also likeable and her chemistry with Jamie and Joseph is spot on especially during the action sequences. Not to mention that there are some witty one liners and some funny moments along with some drama that doesn't feel sappy and shoe-horned in.Overall, it's not a perfect movie and it's certainly won't win any newcomers, but this is a decent superhero flick that's got some good action, solid performances, and nice cinematography.

56,kjproulx,An Enjoyable Film That Could've Gone Further,7,14 August 2020,"I'm a sucker for an original concept revolving around superpowers. I even enjoy movies that most critics pan, like Jumper or Push. For that reason alone, I was looking forward to Netflix's feature film, Project Power. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but if you're looking for some solid entertainment as you're scrolling through Netflix, you can find much worse than this one. Now streaming, here are my thoughts on Project Power.The film begins by sucking you into this world where new pills have been developed, which in turn give you a random power, but only for five minutes at a time. There are side effects that could lead to death and some will only use it to become criminals, so it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The idea of that alone is what hooked me from the start, but I couldn't help but feel slightly underwhelmed at where the story ends up. At its core, this is just a story about a man trying to get his daughter back, who has been kidnapped by the people who run this new organization. With such a rich world to invest in, the story felt pretty stale at times.With that said, I was able to look past the flaws in the story and have quite a good time with the action sequences and cool powers people were receiving. Yes, the heart of the story revolves around Art (Jamie Foxx) and his mission to get his daughter back, but I was more interested in the side characters Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Robin (Dominique Fishback). Their dynamic with each other, as well as the screen time Fishback gets with Foxx were easily the most enjoyable aspects. All three of these performances were top-notch, but I was more impressed with Fishback, because Foxx and Gordon-Levitt are usually always fantastic.Where this film shines and falters at the same time is in the powers department. Project Power can be a really awesome concept when certain powers are utilized to heighten a certain action sequence, but the powers started to feel like plot devices in themselves towards the final act. The powers are supposed to be random, yet certain characters were able to get out of situations easily because they happened to get the perfect power for a specific situation. That made me roll my eyes a bit, but when it comes down to it, a complaint like that for a movie like this is really just a nitpick.Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman have made a couple of films that I've enjoyed in the past. Most notably with the film Nerve. I thought that film was far more entertaining than it had any right to be, which is why I enjoyed the feel of this movie overall. Project Power is a blast to watch, but it's not without its pretty glaring issues story-wise. Some viewers may not like it for the violence or lackluster overall story, but I just thought it was a fun ride to take and it never felt boring. Project Power gets a solid recommendation from me.",Project Power
57,kuarinofu,How to ruin an interesting concept,5,15 August 2020,"Damn this film is a letdown.I really hoped that this film would be something interesting or at least try to break the established stereotypes and try to be something else, but I was wrong.It's just so predictable and boring, every scene in this film you can see from miles away, even the big climax and the reveal of our main character's power is done so poorly it barely even felt like anything (although it was telegraphed a few minutes before that and they've messed up the facts).At first, I thought this film would push the message about the fact that dealing drugs is bad, and even if you feel different in class as a teen, you need to find what you know how to do best and just stick to it, being different is okay (this is Jamie Foxx literally says). You know, a good empowering message since they did some scenes showing poverty and the life of socially unprotected people who barely survive in the slums. But they just drop this like they drop many of the film's subplots.The interesting concept this film is based on is destroyed by the most predictable, boring, cliche, and unrealistic story you can think of. Just your basic stereotypical villains with unclear intentions and really wacky plans.The only almost real character within this film is Robin. Besides her, there's just nothing to grab onto. Jamie Foxx's character has a very basic motivation that pushes him into kidnapping, child abuse, and multiple homicides. Half of the film he's just a homicidal maniac, but in the end, he still is a good guy. Frank is just a cop guy with no intentions or motivations. Other people in the film are just people, not characters.Yeah but the powers are also boring. They establish that these are only animal abilities, but some of them feel much more than that. An animal who can set itself on fire and run around? Who is that? Ragnaros? Also, wouldn't it be cool if some people would get less powerful abilities that don't really give them any benefits but instead just provides for some funny scenes (instead of them just blowing up)? Well, the last henchman had this sort of frog ability that rendered him melee instead of using guns, wouldn't it be cool if his bones would just crush and he would literally incapacitate himself? Why were the creators so uncreative and narrow-minded?And the last thing, the direction and the editing were not good. Weird shots, jump-cuts, continuity, this film had everything (the first couple of scenes looked like a rap video). Project power disappointed me, but maybe it did that just because I had my hopes and I shouldn't have.P.S. At least the film had 2 good jokes, Jamie Foxx's reaction to Robin fancy herself a rapper (and actually doing a good job at it), and the big bearded guy destroying a huge armored door instead of taking the obvious escape hatch.",Project Power
58,msbreviews,"Project Power has a really interesting concept, but it doesn't reach half of its potential...",5,14 August 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Project Power is the most recent Netflix project featuring a great cast, but the attention-grabber for me is the screenplay debut for Mattson Tomlin (also co-writing The Batman with Matt Reeves). It's the closest to a superhero movie any viewer is going to get for the following months, but at the same time, it couldn't be more different than the usual flicks from said genre. I barely knew a thing about the film besides the synopsis and the cast, so I was open to everything Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman cooked up. The concept definitely intrigued me, the cast convinced me, and the movie itself... didn't reach half of its potential, unfortunately.Let's start with the positives. Even though Dominique Fishback had a part in The Hate U Give, this is her first big role in an also big film, and she's probably the best thing about it. She delivers a pretty good performance, especially for someone who has to share so much screentime with two experienced actors, but her rapping skills steal the show. Not only the improvised lines fit her character, Robin, but the way that she raps elevates every single rhyme. As expected, Jamie Foxx is remarkable as Art, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Frank. Both incorporate their characters seamlessly, performing their dialogues and action sequences with ease.Character-wise, Robin and Art receive generic yet quite efficient arcs. Both are driven by cliche motivations connected to their own families, but the actors do a fantastic job making it all feel realistic and emotionally compelling. Mattson Tomlin's script for each character also helps with captivating conversations and memorable lines. However, both the story and the remaining characters lack depth. Frank doesn't have any sort of backstory or unique motives, being merely a cop who wants to protect his city. The ""bad guys"" (Rodrigo Santoro, Amy Landecker) represent the most formulaic aspect of the whole movie: just the usual greedy, egocentric, power-driven drug dealers, version #271837 put to film.The movie's concept is fascinating, and its first half does an excellent job of exploring and expanding that premise. Sadly, the main focus eventually switches to the supposedly more entertaining, action-heavy plot. The ""supposedly"" wasn't written by chance because the action scenes are rather disappointing, to be honest. Sure, there are a couple of unquestionably eye-opening sequences, which contain decent visuals. Nevertheless, most are so filled with CGI and hard-to-follow, choppy editing (Jeff McEvoy) that I could rarely see an entire sequence clearly. Michael Simmonds' cinematography employs way too shaky camera movements as well.There's even what I think was supposed to look like a one-take action set piece, but due to the aspects referenced above, it just doesn't seem like it. In addition to this, the powers displayed could use a bit more creativity. Having in mind that everyone has a different power, superstrength, superspeed, or the ability to create fire aren't exactly groundbreaking skills. With so many superhero films released in the past few years, Project Power could have delivered something unique (granted, there's one underrated power taken from an animal that's pretty badass), but it stayed in the safe zone.Overall, the action and the editing are so inconsistent that I can't really fault them entirely. The most disappointing aspect of all is how little development the primary narrative gets. I firmly believe it's a fantastic premise to create a TV show out of it, but Joost and Schulman could have done a better job with Tomlin's screenplay, which could have taken a much more detailed approach with a more experienced writer. Taking everything into account...Project Power boasts a talented cast, featuring a badass Jamie Foxx and a remarkable Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but it's Dominique Fishback who steals the spotlight. Demonstrating not only her acting abilities but also her rapping skills, Fishback shines in her first significant role. Her character and Foxx's are the heart and soul of the movie, which possesses a genuinely intriguing take on the superhero concept, but that, unfortunately, fails to reach its potential. The remaining characters are extremely undeveloped, especially the cliche, power-thirsty villains who I even struggle to remember their names. Some action sequences might deliver what viewers are looking for, but most are packed with an incomprehensible amount of CGI, uncontrollably choppy editing, shaky camera movements, and a lack of imagination regarding the powers shown. If the focus stayed in telling a more detailed narrative instead of the disappointing action, maybe it would have been quite a nice surprise. As it is, it's far from being a bad film, so I recommend it to anyone who wants a generic yet remotely entertaining action-packed Netflix flick.Rating: C+",Project Power
59,SoumikBanerjee25,Better than 'The Old Guard'!,7,18 August 2020,"""Project Power"" is an entertainer which serves a familiar formula with an astounding cast that thrived; A fun ride, that will surely keep you engaged throughout the runtime.
It's been a busy schedule for Netlfix.
Even in the midst of Lockdowns all around the world; Only Netflix is pumping movies in the streamline like crazy. Their new iteration in the Action Genre has an interesting premise that subsequently gives us a well executed end product. All thanks to its action pieces and a bunch of enigmatic performances!Jamie Foxx is as always a charming presence on the screen. Joseph Gordon Levitt as a homicide cop does play his role pretty convincingly. Although this particular Character should have had much more screen presence in my opinion.
Dominique Fishback as Robin was like a breathe of fresh air. She brings out an altogether different tonality on the table. Totally distinctive in nature comparing to others. Credit goes to a well structured depth in her; which shows personal struggles, her hidden talent & a kind hearted human being. Absolutely Loved her portrayal in here.Action pieces are powerful (No pun intended). Well choreographed and at times innovative as per requirements. Cinematography is decent, and the sound score is even better. It's an adrenaline pumping score that duly compliments on-screen imagery.Still the film has some glaring issues.
Such as badly written villain roles whom I simply couldn't give any attention to!
At times slower paced screenplay that annoyingly drags!
An overall Generic Execution on a super impressive premise that undoubtedly deserved more.Other than that, this was a fine experience. Definitely worth your time if you are into action movies or if you are fan of any of the above-mentioned actors.
Go give it watch!
You won't be disappointed!",Project Power
60,mahmus,It wastes a great premise in a generic thriller plot.,4,15 September 2020,"The first act's really good (mostly 'cause the powers actually play a role), but gets dull in the second act (because you could remove the super powers and not much would change). The third act's also dull, but at least the powers play a role again.I don't believe the relationship between any of the characters. I don't hate it, I just don't buy it. The three main actors give solid performances and are fun to watch (I particularly enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a towel as an angry husband. Jamie Foxx kinda phones it in). The villains suck though.I thought Machine Gun Kelly was going to be the most distracting thing about this movie, but then Casey Neistat showed up. At least his appearance in Nerve made sense since it all about vlogging or something, I don't know I never saw it.Enjoyable at times, but pretty mediocre overall.",Project Power

They really should make another, but they need to make sure it's just as high quality.I really don't see why anyone *wouldn't* like this movie, especially since there's a huge lack of content right now (that pretty much only Netflix is filling, by the way). This movie was a breath of fresh air for me, just like Eurovision was.In some scenes, the lighting and sound seemed to be not that good quality (while everything else was), but maybe this is just me. Voices in crowds would be a lot lower than other voices and things like that, and in a lot of scenes the lighting (or maybe the color overall) seemed slightly off. For comparison, the railroad crossing scene looks right, but some other scenes don't. This is very minor, but I couldn't help think it during a lot of scenes.",Project Power
64,Stanlee107,Power played,5,15 August 2020,"This isn't as bad as many reviewers would lead us to believe. In this sci-fi world criminals have engineered a pill that gives anyone ""(super) power"" for 5 minutes...Jamie Fox is as likeable as ever in this role of a father-disgraced-cop that is on the hunt for kidnapped daughter. It was great to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt back in a film again. He seemed to have disappeared after Inception. Talking of which there are scenes that one cannot helped but noticed scenes similar to/ inspired by that film. He plays the stoic cop that cannot be corrupted unlike many in his precinct.... He has an informant Dominique Fishback that does well in her portrayal of a down in luck teenager with a troubled home life.This is an enjoyable film that has nothing new to add to this genre. The special effects are fine and the action scenes equally watchable. This is not classic film but it is worth a watch.",Project Power
65,ronakkotian,A cool idea with a generic story,4,17 August 2020,"This film actually has a very interesting idea. Swallowing a pill that can give you a random power for five minutes is cool but it's a shame they came up with the most generic story for it.Project Power follows a teenage dealer, a cop and an ex-soldier who try to take down the people responsible for the creation of the pill that can give people any superpower.The concept is cool and had the potential to transform into a very good film but sadly the script that was made had the most generic story for it where Jamie Foxx takes down this group of people because they took his daughter away from him. It's something we've seen countless times and Project Power doesn't add anything new to it. It's bland and predictable. The visual effects for the superpowers are really well done the cinematography is great and the performances by Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback are great. Where the film really suffers is its script.You don't really feel much attachment with any of the characters. By the end of it you can argue Fishback's character didn't even need to be in the film. Some of the action scenes are poorly done where you don't even know what's going on. It's sad to see such a unique idea go to waste. I wish they worked on the script more and produced more drafts so that we could got something different and memorable but that wasn't the case.Project Power is a film I'm gonna forget in a few days and probably never watch again. It presents us with a boring story and characters that are barely interesting. All in all, this is a very forgettable movie.",Project Power
66,trinaboice,Entertaining diversion,7,16 August 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This is the third movie collaboration between Machine Gun Kelly and directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost. The power in this project is the two power-house actors Jamie Fox and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, plus a surprising young starlet, Dominique Fishback.I've read some reviews that think this movie is terrible, but I disagree. It's definitely not perfect, but it serves as an entertaining distraction and something new to watch on Netflix during this pandemic when we've all seen just about everything on streaming already.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Drug and dealers
A LOT of violence
Some texting young kids wouldn't be able to read fast enough. But seriously, your kids shouldn't watch this anyway.
Several brutal deaths with blood. High body count
Some profanityTHEMES:
Power
""You gotta do what you do best and rock that."" - Art (Jamie Foxx)
Family
Everyone is unique with their own special powers.THINGS I LIKED:
Good special effects
I expected nothing but excellent performances from Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I adore both of them and wasn't disappointed. What surprised me was Dominique Fishback's performance. Some movie critics thought she was annoying, but I thought she did a great job.
There are a few funny scenes that caught me off guard because I was expecting pure drama and action.
Cool (pun intended) action sequence filmed from behind icy glass.
Lots of action.
A timely scene about race and the police.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Some viewers who dislike the movie mention the nonsensical plot-lines. There are holes, for sure, but the story does make sense.
The action scenes aren't anything we haven't seen before. They go on for a while, so you begin to feel a bit numb to it.
Educators will be shocked by a teacher's approach in the classroom.
Parents will be shocked by a message that seems to tell kids to drop out of school and become a rapper.
The movie Limitless explores some of the same things but was soooo much better. Even the TV version of the movie was better than this.You can see the rest of my review at Movie Review Mom Youtube channel and website. Thanks!",Project Power
67,sbweightman,"Lacking in plot and vision, but great special effects and acting.",7,29 October 2020,"A relatively straightforward drugs movie with the twist that the pills provide the users with short term, spectacular looking superpowers. The plot's nothing special and doesn't fully live up to its premise, but the acting is good and the action scenes are fast paced and stylish. Most of the film looks good with its urban hip-hop style and attitude and although the villain and her plan is as cliché as they come, the idea of the rich manipulating the poor by using drugs is probably quite close to reality.",Project Power
68,drewnes,"""There are no laws on this drug.""",6,30 May 2021,"Let me start with the positive: Whoever worked on the VFX in this knew what they were doing. Everything looks sharp, and the colors pop the way a comic book style movie should. I hope more action movies in this genre can add more pop to their color.What needed work: The story starts off pretty good and I was into it but the third act felt like it came to an end pretty quickly and it feels like there was something missing. I could've totally seen this as a tv show, and I think in that format they could've explored more angles.",Project Power
69,danielmanson,Decent action film,8,22 August 2020,"Seeing that Jamie Foxx and JGL were in this film I had to give it a watch.
And it's pretty good. Don't get me wrong it's not intense thriller or anything, but it's a nice, simple action film. Good special effects, plot was easily understandable and acting was great also. I feel like sometimes you need a bog standard action film, with explosions and gun fights etc and this provided.I would have liked more depth within the main characters, granted it would have made the film much longer. But it would have been nice for some additional background info on them and so on.Would have liked to have seen more from the ""villain"" in this film. Don't really get an idea of who it is. Again this links to depth.But overall it's a fun, entertaining action film with all the right elements needed. Well worth watching one evening!",Project Power
70,PyroSikTh,The Boys Lite,7,7 September 2020,"Project Power follows two separate men as they try to uncover the source of a new drug on the market; 'Power'. It's a small capsule with a glowing substance inside that, when ingested, gives you a superpower for five minutes. The catch is you don't know what superpower you're going to get on your first try. It could be impenetrable skin, or invisibility, or you could morph into a hulking monstrosity, or you could just explode into a gory mess. Art is an ex-Marine who was experimented on in the drug's early days. His continuous use of Power resulted in his daughter inheriting superpowers permanently. The pharmaceutical company has kidnapped her and uses her as the source of the latest batch. Frank on the other hand is a rough-round-the-edges detective who has no qualms with using Power himself in order to 'level the playing field' with the criminals he's aiming to catch. When he's caught, he's set on the trail of Art, unknowingly working towards the pharmaceutical company's agenda. Stuck between it all is a teenager who peddles the drug between school work and looking after her ill mother, who has dreams of becoming a world-famous rapper.It's a fine enough concept and story, but hardly revolutionary, and in truth the film doesn't even try to be fresh with it. It plays out almost exactly like a rip-off of The Boys and other darker comic-book takes. The characters all have a little bit of backstory in order to help the audience root for them, but nothing particularly interesting or moving. Even Art's backstory of losing his daughter is cliche enough that it just becomes another plot point. Not to mention the blatant and lazy stereotyping of making Robin an aspiring rapper, as if young black kids don't dream of being anything else. She could've dreamed of being a doctor after all the care she does for her mother, or a policewoman after all the sneaking around and investigating she does, but no, she wants to be a rapper, and it has absolutely no bearing on the story whatsoever, other than to seem hip and cool in a vain attempt to appeal to teenage viewers. Stop it. Teenagers have better taste than you give them credit for.But honestly, if you went into a blatant popcorn action movie on Netflix expecting top-tier writing, you were just kidding yourself. It's not that movie, and it was never trying to be. Would it have been better with a little more care and attention in the screenplay? Sure, but I didn't feel like my enjoyment was hampered by it one bit. The story and characters are just there as vessels for two hours of pure entertainment, and on that front Project Power works quite well. It's never dull or boring, and strings you along with enough thrills and a couple of giggles that the time flies away.
But without depth, Project Power needed to impress in more superficial ways, and it does. Okay, it does for the most part. In some ways it comes across as somewhat amateurish or cringy. Some of the photography looks like TV movie quality, almost all of the licensed music was picked for the same reason Robin was made an aspiring rapper, rather than actual relevance to the movie, and sometimes the VFX can look like a video game cutscene. That said there are some really cool shots and scenes with clever cinematography that draws you in and/or shows you new perspectives of scenes we've all seen a million times. The best one that comes to mind involves a woman locked in a temperature-regulating cell after she takes a pill. The electricity goes out so the cell fails and we watch her fail to control her new powers and eventually succumb to them. But the real focus of this scene is actually the action happening in the room around her, as Art bursts in and takes down henchman after henchman. We're left inside the cell looking outwards, hearing the muffled sounds of gunshots and guys getting beaten up, adding a new dynamic to what would otherwise be a fairly mediocre and forgettable fight sequence. The original score by Joseph Trapanese is also fantastic. It's constantly moving and ramping up with interesting synth sounds sprinkled throughout. It blends heavier dance music with darker hip-hop creating a really cool sonic identity rarely heard in movies. In some places it feel a little heavy-handed or single-note, rarely coming down to dwell in the quieter moments, so as a film score it's fairly average, but with pieces of music this good and listenable I can't really complain. And some of the CGI is legitimately fantastic. This is the best visual representation of Human Torch I've ever seen, as the flames engulf the host and leave him with somewhat permanent skin damage. It just looks so much more realistic than the balls of flame in a rough human shape we usually get. Similarly Art unleashing his ""Pistol Shrimp"" power in the rain is a beautifully captivating moment from a visual standpoint, as rain droplets turn into wispy flame and disintegrate anything they touch.In all Project Power is a perfectly acceptable and satisfying movie for what it wants to be; a dumb action flick with some slightly more grounded depictions of superpowers. It could've been so much more, as almost all dumb action movies can be, but when it's as good as it is on a superficial level, it's easy to just accept it for what it is than dwell on any potential it may have lost. I give The Boys Lite an enjoyably shallow 7/10. If nothing else, this movie gave us Dominique Fishback who could easily go onto much better things after her performance here.",Project Power

72,nikola17,very good film a much better Superhero film then to Old Guard,7,19 August 2020,"It's about time for Netflix to release a better film like this film was pretty good film it's heaps better then to Old Guard, the Old Guard is a superhero film that is based on comic book people praised on a boring trash forgettable film, this is a much miles better comic book film didn't I luv this film? NO but was it good? YES it was entering, it has a lot of potential in it the performance and cast was good Jamie Foxx did hell of job in this film I always loved Jamie Foxx Collateral, Jarhead, Miami Vice (2006) Remake, Kingdom, Horrible Bosses 1&2, Django Unchained, White House Down, Sleepless one of my personal favorite underrated film of all time you gotta checkout Sleepless, then to this new film Project Power and can't wait for upcoming Spawn reboot starting Jamie Foxxother superhero third time he is playing. I would say this is a lot better role for Jamie Foxx then he had in trash sequel Amazing Spiderman 2 when he played Electro / Max Dillon give me a break his role in this film is a lot better role in film then to Amazing Spiderman 2. then his 3rd one will be reboot of Spawn even better I can see him as Al Simmons / Spawn. critics thankfully got praised on performances of the cast, action sequences and visuals but funny thing is criticized the screenplay for not taking full advantage of its premise? so people who loves superhero films didn't give give fully advantage on premise of this film? give me a break. but no Old Guard gets more praised not even 1 Negative thing about it some people gave it a Negatives but not enough for it to bomb Old Guard. this gets 6.0 witch I don't buy it sadly but old guard got 6.7 close and 81% on Rotten Tomatos but for this film 60% on Rotten Tomatoes?? this must be joke wish it was a joke. what was so bad about this film? I actually had fun with this film this is not related to comic book film this is like It wasn't a comic or TV series in the past, it's a brand new creation from up-and-coming just like with Brightburn, Darkman, Unbreakable, Hancock, Push, El Chicano I am not sure if Crow 94 film was based or not based on comic but their is many more of their with superhero films that weren't based on comic book films but end of day it's still great and creative film, were villains were good? not really but I would say better villains then to Old Guard, but performance and cast suited very well? yes I abouslte agree with cast, Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordan Levitt I loved and been a big fan of Looper, Don Jon, Killshot, Premium Rush, Sin city Dame to Kill for but he wasn't best character in sequel.
I like creative idea if you take pill you do or transform anything you can imagine users unpredictable superpowers for five minutes it's not Red or Blue pill that's Matrix different subject. the story was simple it doesn't try to hard as it can it's just simple basic film that's all it is. Robin (Dominique Fishback) is being a dealer and trying to rob people she got nearly robbed by customers seeking Power. She is rescued by NOPD Officer Frank Shaver (Joseph Gordan Levitt) going after guys who are robbing bank I liked how he times after he got shot in head but nothing happens then he finds out hits the streets of New Orleans with those power pills Frank is in situation of man hunting for the distributor ""Biggie"", tracks down Newt. times where Joseph nails his role his acting and performance their are times I had no issues with his role I think he nailed his role perfectly I can't see anybody playing his role or Jamie Foxx role I just can't.Art (Jamie Foxx) is looking for Robin he kidnaps her but not in a bad way so he can be with her and find his daughter Tracy, born after the experiments, exhibited powers without ever taking the drug. villain Biggie not Biggie Smalls Notorious B.I.G but different character Biggie (Rodrigo Santoro) he was one who made pills of Project Power Biggie claims that Power represents ""the next evolution of the human species with the pill's powers derived for animals.
also I liked other villain Wallace (Tait Fletcher) known for John Wick, Equalizer, Blood Father, Accountant many more movies you name he was in he had role in film not like him as extra or him did noting in film he has character in film that he play's a henchman from biggie you have good fight scene with him and Jamie Foxx. I was so surprised that MGK (Machine Gun Kelly) was in film just at opening witch I didn't know until I looked his character up. I was pretty surprised that this film was creative but based on comic book it's true it's not based on comic book. and yes this is a lot recommded then to Old Guard witch was boring slow, with this film it's watchable it's interesting it's different performance Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordan Levitt did great in film you can tell they are having fun in this film the set up of film it's creative some of cool staff you never seen. and Old Guard is R-RATED but it's soft R-RATING piece of crap it make itself PG-13 film. but with this R-RATED Superhero that isn't based on a comic book just like Old Guard. this film really hit fan of R RATED and it suited for R-RATED film but it deserved a lot better just like with Wheelman, Bright, Point Blank, 6 Underground, Spencer Confidential but not Old Guard gets one massive pass but not this I rather watch this film all over again rather then seeing Old Guard or Agent Marvel of shield thank goodness it's not TV series for 2 hours I rather have this as movie, give this a shot while been under lockdown during Pandemic it's worth watching if you luv superhero films give this a look believe me it's isn't bad film if you got Netflix give it a shot you it's a lot worth watching please avoid other crap films like Old Guard trash boring 2 hour long film, you want superhero films that you want to see different creative type like you never seen before check out this film it's really worth watching it's similar concept to other film called Push (2009) if you have seen or not check it out",Project Power

The story is nonsense, the dialogue corny, the VFX probably a lot more effective on a big screen than on a domestic one which is where most of us will have seen it given that cinemas have in the main been closed during the pandemic, at least in the UK.

76,TwistedContent,In Tradition of the Blockbusters of Netflix,6,17 August 2020,"I've been a little frustrated with one particular Netflix ""product line"", the blockbusters. Examples include ""Bright"", ""Spenser Confidental"", ""Extraction"", ""6 Underground"", ""Shaft"", ""Tripple Frontier"" and so on, you get the picture. Frustrated because of their consistency in feeling average, often uninspired, and nearly always built on cliché blueprints. Most of them are 6's and enjoyable movies, but it never really changes. Such is the situation in which ""Project Power"" arrives on the scene, and it fits right in.""Project Power"" excels with the same things most of the blockbusters do - good acting from a nice cast & expensively beautiful looks. The story, with its most intriguing device being a drug that gives people unpredictable superpowers, is otherwise very familiar and predictable. Archetypical charms. The intentioned intensity is never achieved, pacing's very uneven, plot's a chaos of ideas. The intriguing drug universe, naturally, also gets filled with things of the underwhelming kind. On the bright side though, everything plays out in rather tasty aesthetical ways & all is led by three solid leads - Jamie Foxx, Dominique Fishback and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, there's energy and charm and It's all good, man. Pretty cool original score, too.Frankly, that's all I can say about about ""Project Power"" and it's serious lack of power. The film is, by all means, not bad, in my opinion a tad bit above average, but it's also something painfully familiar, just in fresher clothes. Do I want a sequel? Not quite, but I'll still watch it.

79,coreyjdenford,Stable Power,6,14 August 2020,"You might have all heard the phrase, if you could have one superpower, what would it be? Well Netflix's Project Power takes that phrase literally, when a pill arrives on the streets of New Orleans that can give you any power for five minutes, whatever that power is, you could be fast, invisible, impervious to bullets or have super strength. The only downside to the pill, it's a lottery, the power could be bad. It's 50/50, and that'll be your main thought through the film to, the action is good, it's fast paced, gritty and it's fun, Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback give punchy performances and are hugely likeable characters, the direction is competent too. The main problem is the script, it feels as if it was just a drafted script and not fully checked through and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman probably said to the writer, it doesn't matter is the script is good. But sadly that is Project Power's main problem it struggles to make sense of what the film is trying to be. It wants to be a film about superpowers, and it pulls that off really well, but it doesn't have the same dramatic core as other films about superpowers. Albeit, the rest of the film is punchy, it's gritty, it's fast paced and a rollicking good time, if you don't watch it for the script. In conclusion it's good but forgettable.",Project Power

Of course, it's hardly original; the main character is secretly a clichéd deus ex machina & the film provides absolutely nothing we haven't already seen countless before - executed in far better fashion in numerous other features by undoubtedly superior filmmakers - but that doesn't stop it from being a standard, enjoyable popcorn flick - so long as you're looking to kill time for a few dispensable hours...

Project Power is such a perfect example of Netflix movies. I would say for every 10 Project Powers, there's one The Irishman.A lot of reviewers are saying that this movie could've been better if the execution matched the creativity of the plot, but I disagree. Action movie plots that have this type of story are never really that good; even if you get the best directors, actors, and screenwriters in world. The biggest issue with the plot are the cliches, and there are a lot of cliches. You've got the evil corporation, a mysterious good guy, a naive cop, and a child companion. But if I had to say one good thing about the plot, it would be the pacing. Project Power was entertaining enough to make nearly two hours feel like one.I think that overall, the acting was average. The cast was insane though, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jamie Foxx, and rappers and YouTubers. Really, the best thing outside of the plot was the practical and visual effects. The VFX was surprisingly good, like too good. I honestly thought that Project Power would have mediocre VFX, but it was very impressive. The makeup was really good too. It wasn't nearly as good as when comparing it to the visual effects, but it definitely holds up.If I had to describe Project Power with one word, it would ""meh"". There's some good qualities, and then there's some bad qualities. I think that with all I've just mentioned, Project Power falls right in the middle with a 5/10.",Project Power
83,TheHoodOfSwords,Fun Flick,6,21 August 2020,A pretty fun sci fi superhero flick. Something my friend endingmirror would like. Since he loves anything superhero related.

Director: Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman
Starring: Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Dominique Fishback, Rodrigo Santaro, Amy Landecker, Machine Gun Kelly, Tait Fletcher, Kyanna Simone Simpson etcOverall rating 80/100Project power is about a drug that is being tested on dealers in New Orleans, where It gives you superpowers for 5 minutes, Art (Jamie Foxx) is trying to track down the leader of the group dealing the drug in a search for his missing daughter, but with the help of a recently fired police officer Frank (Joseph Gordon Levitt) and a young girl who unintentionally got caught up in the dealing of these superpower drugs Robin (Dominique Fishback) they must team together to stop the drug from being dealt worldwide. Project power was a lot of fun and was a really interesting movie despite it being generic, so let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film had a really interesting concept, action sequences and visual creativity. The actual concept of having a pill that gives you powers for 5 minutes I thought was really interesting and creative, the little details added with taking multiple at a time or not knowing what is going to happen to you was well explored. The visual creativity of the film was also great, the designs of all the powers and how they came to life on screen was great to watch, the film also got creative with the process of taking the pill and the lighting. The action sequences were also great, these were definitely one of the best parts of the movie, they were always consistently entertaining and fun to watch, with the wide variety of powers to explore and have fun with the R rating also helped with just adding that little bit of edge and gore to the scenes.My next few positives would be the character background, the connection between the main characters and the performances. I liked the character background that they added for Jamie Fox's character. The use of flashbacks to show his daughter being taken away from him, really made you understand his character and empathise with him, It gave his character a clear purpose and gave a sense of urgency to the plot. I also really liked the connection between Jamie Fox and Dominique Fishback's character Robin. I thought to have both characters have similar forms of grief of losing a daughter and a father, made them connect more as they could find that relationship that they hadn't had for so long with each other, this was definitely a clever and heart-warming addition to the film that just worked. All the performances were also great, both Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Levitt bought there A game here. They went all out and didn't hold back with their performances for there characters and it payed off, both of their experience in acting showed and payed off for very interesting and fun characters to watch. But the best performance in the film for me was Dominique Fishback. Wow she was fantastic, as a newbie to acting as far as I know, she really stole the show, she was a breath of fresh air to watch, with her handling and delivering a lot of emotions throughout that really made you connect with her character, she stole every scene that she was in and I hope to see her in more roles in the future.My few negatives for the film would be the unlikeable qualities to Jamie fox's character, the rushed character background for Robin, it was fairly generic and there were some unexplained parts of the plot. I thought the way Jamie Fox's character handled trying to get Robin to help him by kidnapping her and threatening to kill her mum was slightly too dramatic, and made his character seem very unlikeable for a bit, this could have been handled and done much better. I also felt like they rushed Robin's background slightly for a lot of the movie, they showed a lot about her home life and how much she struggles at school but I felt like it was only briefly touched up and then brushed under the carpet instead of adding more depth. The movie was also fairly generic, a lot of the plot you have probably seen before, in terms of a lot of powers the structure and characters within the plot showing a familiarity to previous films like this, so it would have been nice that there creativity with the visuals and the idea would of translated into the plot as a whole. And finally there was some unexplained plot points that didn't make sense for a while. I thought all the police targeting Jamie fox's character and painting him out to be the bad guy was an odd decision and was never really explained until the final act, I knew when seeing his character that he wasn't a bad guy, but the film was trying to create mystery by making him seem like her could be the bad guy and manipulating Robin but it just didn't work.My final few positives would be the good themes and great ending. I thought the film tackled issues on racism and grief very well, Robin's character really struggled in school and the film did tackle that society and getting jobs for black women are more difficult, this was handled sensitively and well and made you like the characters even more, I also liked how the film handled the issues surrounding grief and family, the film tackled this really well especially for Robin's character who whilst perhaps her ways of getting money to help her mum wasn't the best her heart was in the right place, expressing the importance of keeping your family close. The ending was also fantastic, it was constantly entertaining and the build up of the reveal for Jamie Fox's character was worth the wait, they gave all the characters satisfying endings and the action was at it's best.Overall despite it lacking originality with it's plot and some strange creative choices, Project power is an entertaining and fun action movie that highlights the fantastic actors involved and introduces us to new ones who I hope to see more of in the future.",Project Power

It is about a man searching for his daughter and a police officer who tries to take down a drug dealer.
It seems like a generic story but what makes it interesting is that the pill (drug) gives them super powers for 5 minutes.
Although we already saw this in the movie ""Limitless"", the truth is that the justification of the pill / drugs is well achieved.
Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt make a spectacular dumbbell.
Quality.
Entertaining
The rhythm makes you not want to miss a moment alone.

Well done action sequences, as well as fighting stunts are well done. Just two moments are not quite right.

Only, the mutants are mutants thanks to little pills. Ala limitless.What I can say is that it's immensely entertaining. The pace is absolutely break neck. Yet, it does it great job of establishing every little detail needed for the 3rd act. The script really is the star here.It's got lots of clever little things here. Well structured, well paced, just real tight. As for the the rest of the fipm can be a bit hit and miss. There's some cheese and wack dialogue here and there.

88,Mcduff3601,"Not sure why other people hate this movie so much, I found it entertaining... for what it was",7,16 April 2021,"I think I have come to expect less from Netflix originals. It is rare to come across something I HAVEN'T seen on Netflix that leaves me feeling just blown away or that I had just watched something that will be added to my all time favs list to be watched over and over down the road.This is not such a movie but I did find it entertaining. The quality is higher than usual, the blood seemed like it might not have been all CGI or they upped their CGI game. The acting was great from everyone except some of the supporting characters like most of the bad guys.The build up of the characters was a bit weak. Jamie Foxx seems to get most of the screen time leaving the rest for Joseph and the kid leaving NO character development for the bad guys, which you need if you want that juicy moment where the good guys smash the bad guys and you walk away feeling like justice was served (that didn't happen here).It's predictable, formulaic same same you have seen before but the action scenes worked for me. It looked like they were doing their own stunt work and the shots were somewhat stable and somewhat uncut, unlike some other action movies that make you puke if you look at the screen while two vague shapes battle it out (looking at you transformers).This reminded me of Bright another Sci-Fi Fantasy from Netflix that had a very similar vibe. I also liked that one which a lot of people didn't. It also had this weird connection in my mind to Annihilation which the soundtrack reminded me of and sort of the same vibe, these were all ok or good enough for me movies that I enjoyed but most likely will never watch again.",Project Power
89,Brooklynsmagicmike,I throughly enjoyed this movie overall.,8,19 August 2020,"This is actually the second time within the year that netflix gave a go at a big budget super power/hero type of movie with this and old guard.I actually liked this one better. First I felt the pacing was actually good, the movie never felt sluggish/draggy at any point. I thought the premise was pretty neat theres been movies with pills granting people abilities done before but this movie added newer dynamic to it. I also felt the action was done well and was highly entertaining/engaging.The only reason why I won't give this movie 10 stars had more to do with the lack of chemistry between the cast. While I like Gordon-Levitt and Foxx both as actors and I don't think they did horrid job in this. They just werent compatible as duo and it kind felt flat throughout. I also felt without giving to much away in the movie the villains were highly lackluster. I felt there should be more of buildup and what not.Overall I still think the movie is great watch and I hope netflix keeps coming out with films like this one!",Project Power

The plot was a bit intriguing, however it wasn't intriguing enough for me to enjoy the movie. One positive is that I thought the action scenes were pretty decent.

95,noahgibbobaker,Clichéd and lazy,3,21 August 2020,"Project power was a failure from the start. The reason I think this film was never going to work is because of the concept, throughout Project power I was hung up on how dumb it was, I simply didn't by it. On top of being stupid it's is a clichéd mess, every trope known to man kind is used, everything is just handed to people because that's what the terrible screenplay says, therefore nothing feels earned. The characters we are meant to be routing for are hardly developed at all, one of them has a daughter he wants to rescue and one of them likes to rap, that's it, the performances are not very bad Jamie foxx seems like he was genuinely trying, but they're not good by any means. The cinematography is awful and more distracting than anything, a lot of digital zoom and Dutch angles are used in most scenes for whatever reason. It looks really bad. The most impressive thing about Project power is the fact they can make up a scenario involving any power you can imagine and the action scenes are still bad, you can so easily tell the actors are pulling punches or simply don't know what they are doing while filming the action scenes, the stuntmen are doing their best to make it look realistic but everything is just to far gone. I don't think anyone making this film cared much besides a couple actors, not that the film had much potential anyway.I wouldn't recommend Project power to anyone.",Project Power
96,elliotte2,Big Budget Mess,4,14 August 2020,"This is wasted potential.The concept, certain special effects could be a foundation of a multi-sequel exciting series.The movie's direction and editing is absolutely horrible, just horrible. We get 3-minute uninterrupted scenes of a teenager rapping, but a shooting scene so haphazardly edited that you have no idea who the good/bad guys are. Even as picture ended I have very little idea what is going on.Pros:
Concept: People take pill gives them temporary superpowers unknown before you take the pill. Gives the movie a different take on the mutant craze.Special Effects: Varies, but one special effect with the invisible man is off the charts and almost single-handily gave the movie an extra star.Cons:
Direction: All over the place, bad writing, bad characters, just bad. Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Leavitt can be excellent actors, but here there is no material to work with.Editing: Long scenes of nothing, edited scenes of the action you want to see. Too often you just saw bullets fly, and people fall without knowing(or caring) who died.Writing: You can't have stupid one-liners in the middle of murderous violence. I can't watch Marvel movies for this reason and they are PG-13 and geared toward teenagers and fanboys. Doing it in R is even more stupid and removes any pretense of tension.I was debating between 4 and 5 stars, but if there was a sequel I would not watch. Four stars it is.",Project Power

Anyhow I do agree with a lot of reviewers, this doesn't deserve the scores below 5 stars but it also doesn't deserve the scores above 5 either.
CGI was pretty good but nothing not seen before with the best being the ""burning man"" which was also the best scene in the entire movie.
""Netflix Original"" is a little laughable as there's pretty much nothing about this movie that is original, it's all been done before, the only part of the story that can probably be classed as original is the use of ""Tracy"" as the source of the drug, other than that the rest is pretty much standard fare as these stories go.
Entertainment wise its a bit of a snorefest, had the writer actually sat and spent more time creating a stronger story this could've been one of Netflix's best movies but the story is weak & silly, characters talk about ""precincts being torn apart"" by people using the drug yet only show one criminal, a ""chameleon"" and he's a bumbling idiot.
While this is slightly superior to ""the old guard"" it does seem similar in its pilot TV Show feel.
All in all this isn't a superhero movie, it's a movie about a drug, when ingested it gives a person an unknown ability for 5 minutes or it kills them, had the writer put a little more thought into it then it could've been a superhero movie, but he didn't & it isn't.

You are left completely in the dark as to exactly what happened in this film. As for the rest of this film there are so many flaws and bad scenes and unbelievably holes in the plot and story. One of the biggest issues is the way in which you are very slowly and bit by bit told what is happening. It has worked in other films but in this one it does not and I cannot quite explain or figure what it is about it that makes it not work. Then also at about the 50 minute mark Jamie Fox tells a women that systemic racism exist. ( not in those words) He goes on to say that he experienced this. The movie was a solid 7 at least up to this point. I watched the rest but only out of grim determination to see what I started to the end. Hollywood needs to stop pedaling the leftist agenda and make movies instead of selling a false narrative.

So, given how the police were depicted, that aspect was all pretty believable.I'm a fan of both Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt and I think they both do a decent job. My main criticism would be that the villains or bad guys all seemed a little muddled.

This film was a highly anticipated Netflix release and by most accounts it definitely delivers primarily because everything is done very well. Of course Jamie Fox being the top star among a decent amount of Hollywood A-listers, Fox has a reputation for fully embracing roles and this film holds true to that notion but the real entertainment value comes from the cinematography and Sfx going from 0-60 in scene after scene is portrayed beautifully.

It's a *gently* black-centred story, presented in a way that can't possibly offend. I kinda have to laugh at that, it could have been a lot stronger, and I would have liked it. It isn't necessary to have a movie like Black Panther to have a great movie centred on black characters. This was just a really cool movie. What I really liked about it is that it's kind of loose.

124,OneAnjel,"A message film, which must have drawn these great actors",7,18 January 2021,"Jamie Foxx -- massive star power. I mean Django Unchained, Dream girls, Law Abiding Citizen, and one of my favorites The Soloist. Foxx is a goldmine in the film industry. Gordon-Levitt has made a big name for himself as well, probably now known for Inception and Snowden, but who actually began as a child and even had a part in A River Runs Through It -- Robert Redford's film that debuted Pitt after Redford felt he resembled him in his younger days), then having a great run in his tween years on 3rd Rock From The Sun (hysterical comedy), and displaying a passion for human interest films with things like Manic, Don Jon, and Uncertainty, Joseph is a name most people recognize. So when you start watching Project Power it feels a bit like hearing a great song with some kids banging on garbage cans and screeching in the background. Now, from a completely objective standpoint, I think young kids maybe 12-17 would really think this is a cool film. It is aimed at inner-city black youth as a vehicle for believing in yourself and those who try to protect you, so that was a nice touch. The kids did a great job, and both Foxx and Gordon-Levitt would bridge an age-gap into a newer audience. But the film was not up to par for these great actors. I'm giving it 5 stars for the whole raising the hope for kids thing. Maybe that's exactly why they did it. Ok, I'll give it 7 stars.",Project Power

But no, here we go again. Another movie that you might find entertaining if extremely bored. What's more, despite Netflix being so much into diversity these days, the movie depicts predictable racial stereotypes and one has to wonder why it is not being condemned on social media.I have to admit, I fast-forwarded at least 25% of the movie. I have a particular dislike for rap music. Unfortunately that form of music is used several times throughout the film - the young female character Robin being a ""rap artist"".The idea behind the movie is that some ""magical"" pills give you superhuman powers for five minutes. The ""powers"" conferred are different for each individual - from armoured skin and super strength through to physical chameleonism. Some people get no powers and just explode and die. Considering the diversity in effects, I have to wonder why it is exactly five minutes for everyone.I found the character Robin to be extremely annoying and I was hoping she'd take a pill and explode. She is depicted as a young black girl who thinks rap music and pushing the pills is to be preferred to getting a good education, as indicated by her walking out of her school class and throwing her coursework in a bin after being busted by a teacher for texting a dealer. A racist stereotype and hardly the model young black women should be aspiring to.The driver behind the movie - the effects of the pills - is mostly wasted. It's a neat concept but so badly executed.All up, two stars. It promises so much but in the end delivers very little.",Project Power

138,maanikroda,Netflix's seemingly wearing down the already ill informed audience by drowning them in quick production! movies.,5,15 August 2020,"The latest big budget release from Netflix is an entertaining and reasonably comical sci-fi/action starring Jamie Foxx as an ex-soldier who teams up with a New Orleans cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and a street-smart dealer (Dominique Fishback) to track down the source of a an illegal drug that can grant an individual temporary superpowers.The only stipulation of this revolutionary narcotic however, is that there's no knowing as to what superpower the drug will bestow until ingested.With a reputed budget of close to $100m the special effects are predictably excellent and the movie in general is a visual treat, providing some highly enjoyable action sequences and moments of above par choreography. Foxx and Gordon-Levitt (who is thankfully back in front of the camera after a 3 year hiatus from acting) are clearly having fun in their respective roles and the comedic turn of Fishback is an attention grabbing performance from the young actress.However, there's a clear lack of ingenuity and imagination in 'Project Power'. The genetic mutation/superhero angle has been done to death and there aren't any new super powers to whet the viewer's lips that haven't already been seen previously within the X-Men franchise.In addition, like 70-80% of this year's Hollywood movies, it feels the obligation to ram down your throat how horribly downtrodden black people in America are despite the fact that a) It's completely irrelevant to the context of the movie as a whole and b) It is, for the most part, simply not true.The script feels rushed and uneven and, in my opinion, the movie would have faired far better had it been written and produced as an out and out comedy, similar to the underrated 2008 film Hancock. Finally on the negative front, it is terribly predictable and the action movie cliches jump out at every given opportunity.Overall, if there's a hole in your life that'd normally have been filled by a few big budget summer blockbusters then this may very well be an adequate substitute for you. In terms of bog standard action/superhero movies you probably won't get a hell of a lot better than this in 2020 unfortunately and, whilst it does little in the way of providing the audience with anything significantly new, it does achieves in it's goal to entertain fans of the genre.If it is a choice between this and last month's similarly themed Netflix release The Old Guard, however, then I'd definitely opt for the latter.",Project Power

140,haydenluz,Project Power,4,15 August 2020,"Project Power, directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, was just an okay Netflix film, that just needed so much more on the execution end! Joost and Schulman crafted a decent amount of nice shots, giving this film a nice sense of style. They incorporated a handful of cool ideas, and a well selected cast, but due to the generic premise and inconsistencies, Project Power struggled to set itself from the rest of the pack. Project Power has a pretty fast pace, but because of the amount of things going on, it left a lot of events and characters underdeveloped! Joost and Schulman created so many subplots and filler scenes, that could've easily been cut out, and used that time to tighten up the characters and script. Most of the plots were opened up in the beginning act, and left to die by the final act.Jamie Foxx brought a lot of spunk to his character, putting on a good performance. I just wish that Mattson Tomlin spent more time on fleshing him out, rather than entertaining the few too many subplots. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fine, but I didn't really like the way his character was written; not just because he too was underdeveloped, but because it seemed like the creative team tried to make him the comedic relief, but the timing was way off.The screenplay by Mattson Tomlin was a mess! Most of the film's issues were created by the lazily structured script. Tomlin had a real tough time, not only balancing the characters, but balancing the ideas and tones.The action is underwhelming! For a rated R film, you would expect more than what we got, feeling like the creators got a little lazy.

The film is certainly brought to light through the experience of Jamie Foxx and JGL, and that mixes well with a fairly new actress in Dominique Fishback, who I thought did a good job. Typically for some of Netflix's newer films of late such as 'Extraction', it contained several enthralling action scenes that kept me intrigued.

160,Criticalstaff,Project Boredom,4,6 January 2021,"I knew this was a bad film before I pressed play. Yet, I did anyway because the summary promised it takes place in New Orleans and I am a sucker for any movie that goes out of NY or LA. It turns out it did not matter, there is barely any visual diversity in the film and the location has hardly an impact on the story.The story is an excuse to have action set-pieces. The movie is much more interested in the aesthetics of action than on anything it considers a character. The aesthetics are very nice and there is some good amount of creative flair in the way the action scenes are executed. The movie puts a focus on the geography of the gunfights and gives them a ballet-like quality. But, as usual with these action formulaic movies there is a deep misunderstanding of what makes an effective action scene good. Hint: it is the tension between characters, which in turn comes from well-established character motivations.
Speaking of characters, the movie has two of the best and well-known actors working today and completely misuses them. Is Lethal Weapon so hard to rip-off?There is only one scene with Foxx and Gordon-Levitt together on-screen and it might be the most boring one. They are both in a car, the dialogue is very tedious and there is connection, no charm, nothing between them. I don't even know why I am watching this movie at that point. They don't hate each other nor do they like each other. In fact, they are barely different in terms of characterisation: one is a maverick cop the other a renegade soldier and they have to work outside the system to take down this drug smuggling conspiracy.I am not sure if it is a cause or a consequence, but it puts the movie on the shoulders on a young black girl, who is a drug-dealer and an aspiring rapper. Typing it out, it feels like a stereotype but it is not so bad in the film. I actually empathised with her a little. The problem is that while being the protagonist she is also never the main character and has no real impact on the progression of the plot. Instead the movie ping-pongs between Foxx and JGL.
In the third act, the smidge of visual diversity is further reduced, when all of the scenes take place in the corridors and control-rooms of a container ship. Finally after an explosion/action scene that took more computer resources than the last one, the movie is over.This movie was a waste of time and it was frankly embarrassing. It is unfair that Netflix has people subjected to this, and it also includes the people involved in making this excuse of a film.
In definitive, if you have never watched anything in your life, if this is your first movie ever, and if you don't know who Jamie Foxx is or JGL, even then don't watch this.",Project Power

👨‍⚖️ Review : After a long hiatus of 3years Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon is back in this NETFLIX produced Action Packed Thriller. A Power Pill when ingested give superpowers, the only stipulation is that there is no knowledge of what powers one gets untill ingested.This big budget NETFLIX film is high on adrenaline pumping action, visually stunning VFX and some brilliant performances by the leads. With a tinge of urban hip hop music the background score is an extra treat for the audience. The Story lacks genuinity, and you wont find anything superior to what you have already emjoyed in the X-Men Franchise. But is definitely worth your time considering the brillant heart pounding action choreography and VFX. Jamie Foxx Is Brilliant with his accent, fearsome expressions , Levitt is a brilliant sidekick as well. Dominique is praiseworthy.With high budget movies getting a no go to theatres this season all thanks to the pandemic across the globe, Project Power is definitely a visually appealing action entertainer you might want to compensate with.

👍Goods :

165,RobTortureWright,Project Mediocre Rap,5,16 August 2020,"Project Power is a weird concoction of average action scenes, poor dialogue, hero speechs that are more cheesy than a bag of cheddar and for some unknown reason a girl who constantly spits very average raps at any given opportunity.This isn't a bad film, Infact its premise is somewhat unique and intriguing and the action scenes, cgi and acting is mostly very good, but the story plays out poorly and the constant need to put in unnessacary scenes like the mentioned pointless raps is what makes this one of those all too familiar films you put on in the background while you're on your phone, only looking up every five minutes to say ""oh that's kinda cool, that guys on fire"".One of the things I was most disappointed with is the utterly generic bad guys they throw at us. I mean Mr big tough guy who's bald with the beard (Excuse me for not checking his real name) is literally a near extra in great films like The Equaliser and The Accountant but he is talked about throughout this film and questioned ""who is this guy"" for awhile before he becomes yet another generic bad guy with the totally predictable superhuman strength power. What I'm trying to say is there is so much more they could have done in terms of making really unique characters with
very interesting powers but instead used bland typical superhero abilities and quite frankly very boring villians.Overall visually very good at times but it's far from a film you'll remember for more than a day after watching it.Oh and talking about mediocre rap, MGK stars in the film.",Project Power

The characters have to make unreasonable decisions in order to cover up the major flaws in both the story and the characters themselves.Also, why on earth would the movie begin by introducing ""Robin"" and flesh out her story, but just glance over the main protagonist of the movie and then have the audacity to try make an emotional conclusion?",Project Power

Character interactions are good as well as the screenplay. Pacing feels a little bit fast but works with the overall tone.

The story starts with a father searching for his daughter. The special effects of the movie are incredible. Background music and sound effects are excellent. The acting crew is awesome.

They make them shine more and in the end survive where sometimes the lead actor character dies. These younger actors characters are written so bad and annoying making bad decisions ,it ruins the movie. Examples Doctor sleep, Extraction, The Old Guard and Project Power. It's too much. In this movie the message is worst, you take drugs and you are a superhero. You sell and deal with it, not only make bad decisions and save a hostage, save the day, Dodge bullets but also no jail time and become the hero of the movie, are you F kidding me.

It's a solid action movie with 2 or more of our favourites; Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jamie Foxx, Rodrigo Santoro. The bad reviews are from people who are far too fragile about any writer or director who dares to even touch on injustices that befall black people. They're the same people who scream, ""I'm not into politics!"" Or, ""it's too PC!"" Or, ""it was good at first, but then it got too political..."" of course, they're double-speaking; what they really mean is, ""we only want to see movies and film about us and how great we are, we cannot cope with watching movies that are about others."" So they bomb the reviews in order to sabotage plans for possible sequels.
They did it to Black Panther, Watchmen, Luke Cage, Kill The Messenger, Da 5 Bloods, Farming, The Banker, and a number of others. See those reviews for what they are, the intent that they serve, and do not be fooled. This movie is excellent.",Project Power

181,cristinalinderman,A gripping superhero film.,8,15 August 2020,"* There is 1 post-credit scene *The directors' Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman plus crew unleashed a gripping superhero film. The story is about a pill that gives one an unpredictable superpower for five minutes. When I watched the trailer it looked like a combination of the film Limitless (2011) and the superhero series Powers (2015) but it wasn't remotely similar, the film stands on its own. I was completely drawn to this world, who wouldn't want powers, the curiosity to take the risk of taking the pill, and how I loved the consequences given when one have certain powers. It felt like it managed to take a step to reality by what the power can do to oneself. I didn't expect balanced humor but it worked so well in the movie and it doesn't stray away from the serious threat. The effects of the powers were magnificent, as much as I loved it, this film still has the potential for so much more like it needed more superpowers fighting sequences and a little more depth suspense when the 5 minutes were running out. There was a scene that was shot brilliantly how it focuses on the person's power getting out of control while in the background a fight was in progress, every second was mindblowing. The word power has a double meaning in this movie it also touches how one has the power to be anything you want to be and to never let the system tell you differently.The composer Joseph Trapanese! brought the perfect music for this film! A combination of science fiction and a lingering sound of cyberpunk.The cast! Jamie Foxx, Dominique Fishback, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performances were phenomenal. Especially Jamie Foxx and Dominique Fishback! their chemistry was as captivating and entertaining. I can't say the same for the one behind the curtain Amy Landecker, even though her role was small the character wasn't meant for her, maybe another female actor could have done a better job.

I had two hours to kill so I threw caution to the wind and pushed play.Without writing a detailed synopsis, the movie is honestly not bad. It is ""sci-fish"" action movie and in typical fashion, it included plenty of unrealistic and over the top action scenes. The action is fast and furious and seldom lets up. It includes all the usual elements: kidnapped daughter, desperate father looking for her, bad guys selling drugs, cop that does his own thing and plenty of gun fights.Foxx and Gordon-Levitt are good. Foxx seems to be turning into a stand-in for Will Smith as I can easily see casting directors attempting to recruit the latter for this role.This is not a bad movie. Make no mistake, it is not a great one either. What it is, is well produced, decently acted, fast paced and fun. Some of the drug effects are just ""too over the top"" for my liking and it turned a good action movie too far into sci-fi territory without adhering to the basic laws of sci-fi movies.With all that said, it is watchable and entertained me for the duration of its running time.",Project Power

If this is why you're interested in watching it, it's not what you'll get, as the premise quickly becomes sidelined and only 'required' for each of the action CGI set pieces.What you get is a muddled movie, where one minute it wants to be a superhero action flick, then a so-so crime drama, then it turns into some kind of musical drama about a wannabe rapper whose stuck looking after her mum.Basically, whatever it is being sold as, whatever it wants to be, whatever it is trying to be......it isn't.",Project Power

Also, the dialogue was super cheesy.The acting was bad for the most part. Jamie Foxx (Art) put on a rather dull performance. I hope he got paid a lot for doing this. I found the character Robin (Dominque Fishback) to be very annoying and didn't like her one bit. It would've been better off without her. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Frank) was the only decent one.

What saves this movie from complete mediocrity is the performances from the main cast with Dominique Fishback standing out from the rest. The special effects are good but the action is hard to follow in a lot of scenes because of boring choreography and bad cinematography. The script is all over the place with trying to incorporate some interesting themes only to feel like they abandon them halfway through the movie. The two villains in the movie are underdeveloped and seemed to pose little threat to the protagonists. Project power is never as thrilling or as smart as it wants to be so it simply feels mediocre.

204,TheLegendOfThe42,Loses its power pretty quickly,4,2 September 2020,"Starting off as a decently shot, acted and directed flick, ""Project Power"" quickly devolves into a generic, pointless and astonishingly stupid mess. It seems like Netflix greenlit this based on a synopsis alone and the prospect of having two big names attached. Kinda like they always seem to do, and it shows.Now, I know that a film easily can cost millions, but I can't wrap my mind around the fact that Netflix spent 85 of these millions for this film. Seriously. You could have had ten decent movies made from this amount of cash. Easily.But back to topic. Foxx and Gordon-Levitt are mostly fine, even if their characters are just poorly written walking tropes.But what I can't understand is Dominique Fishback's Robin and what she actually does in this film. It's a really questionable character with some even more questionable message written into her, and her portrayal by Fishback is kinda sealing the poopy deal. Sure, let's write a redundant character who's dreaming of becoming a rapper. Nah, it's okay, who needs school? Throw your science books in the trash and live for the dream, right? And then cast this great teenage character with a 30 year old woman with the charisma of a taxidermy mount. Oh well.No need to talk about plot holes, I guess. About cringeworthy rap parts.

Along with this comes some heartfelt and emotional moments that land somewhat of a punch since these characters are mostly fleshed out. The performances of Jamie Foxx, Dominique Fishback, and JGL (absolutely NOT Machine Gun Kelly though) are great and they are committed. It's also nice to see JGL back in a movie again.The idea for this movie is also a cool one and for the first fifteen or so minutes I was hooked and wanted to know more about this drug and what kind of world this movie could setup.Unfortunately though, the movie has a murky and muddled script that leads to a generic, bland, and disinteresting story, which leads me to say that this world-building with this drug is wasted potential.

211,AxProductions,The good out-ways the bad,5,15 August 2020,"This film is by all means a decent watch, but it does have quite a lot to be desired.1st of all, the cinematography, cgi and editing, all compliment each other very nicely, they make the movie world feel real and full, even if the majority of the cinematography choices where very cliche. There was one standout cinematography moment that can't be missed though, and that's the continuous shot inside the glass cage about half way through the movie. It was really well thought out, and made, what seemed to be a dull action scene, more hectic in all the right ways.Editing was also very well done, for the most part, with cuts being purposeful, whilst suiting the handheld look of the film, which a lot of editors seem to lack skill to edit.However the scene order of the film was flimsy, with an intro that should have been cut entirely, as it only confuses the audience as to who the ""mastermind"" is. The editor should have cut everything up to the 2 minute point of film, as all of it up to that point felt forced, with the acting by Rodrigo Santoro, and mgk being terrible. And the over dramatic push in and out and pan and and and... making everything feel like a comedy.Acting by the lead cast was great, and the acting by Dominique Flashback can only be described as impeccable, however, if I ever see another movie with mgk as an actor in it, I swear to God I won't watch it because of how terrible of an actor he is. He only had about 4 lines in the whole film, and it ruined what could have been great moments.Also, from a looks perspective, though Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a decent actor (even if it's ""good acting"" rather than him portraying reality) the way he look, just doesn't fit his role, every-time he was shown on screen, he looked too skinny to perform any of the actions he took, and that actually moves me onto action. Which in most films is bad, and this one is no exception.All of the fight scenes feel staged, with perfect choreography that just wouldn't ever happen in real life, however, there is only one series/film that has ever pulled off realistic fights, and that has to be ""Top Boy"" so I wasn't expecting this film to pull it off.The way characters are developed throughout the story is ok, though it is hard to believe how a girl can trust a powerful man half a day after she was shoved into a truck by him. And why a giant institute/corporation didn't check Arts mouth before putting him into custody is beyond me.Also, the fact that I just had to search up what Arts name on imdbs shows that the characters aren't memorable enough to warrant being in a great film. However, if this where a series rather than a film, I feel like it might have worked better as during the 50 minute point of the film I was about to click off to try to find the next episode. The ending did feel to me like Netflix planning on making a second film, so that may tighten up some loose ends from this first one.Overall this film is worth a watch as it does have some decent moments, primarily coming from Dominique's exquisite performance and portrayal of Robin. However, overall, the film felt cliche, and a bit off beatStory: 6/10Character development: 6/10Editing: 7/10Cinematography: 8/10Acting: 6/10Total: 66/100",Project Power

The central plot is a father trying to find his daughter at the hands of a drug lord (or whatever lord.) It has superheroes, drugs, and crime syndicates, but the focus is on drama. There are no big, exceptional fight scenes or any kind of innovative plot. The scenes go by and you feel fine. It's not some great superhero film dealing with high stakes stuff, nor it is a complex look at the dynamics of this wonderful premise where pills are popped in. When I think about it, yeah, the characters in this are very forgettable. I did not care one bit about what the villain's motivation was. Wait, who was the villain? The bad guys come, fight and die at the hands of our all invincible Art and Frank. It just seemed to be some lazy writing, when I think about it. But, when I don't think about it, I had a fun time.

Will watch it again.,8,16 August 2020,"Here are some things you are not hearing from other reviewers: this movie does what sci fi dystopian fantasy is meant to do and more. Change one or two things and show how characters deal with it. In addition, other worthy topics are bravely touched on: PTSD, fallout from broken families, the feeling of pointlessness at what is taught in school when competing with inordinate pressures in real life. Racial bias from police and others. Disrespect between police and the people they are meant to be saving. Different factions of law (local v FBI or CIA etc) difficulty working together.
I found these additional topics to give this movie a taste of authenticity I don't think I see often enough, especially after the disgusting reality of George Floyd's murder. Very timely!Great effects, amazing actors. Netflix may want to turn this into a series, but I suggest it be a very limited run as much further dilution of the subject will bore.P.S. other reviewers compare it to Limitless. Maybe it's like Push too. But it's also it's own thing.",Project Power

I have 5 minutes left in this movie to watch but I can't see why people are griping about it so very much.

223,TruthSeeker4Life,Total disappointment!,3,15 August 2020,"The entire film is an unorganized mess without any real direction and coherent screenplay. The way the film is shot is pretty cool and some of the graphics were cool but clearly Jamie Foxx and the people behind this film thought their star power would triumph over a poor script and bad acting. The film is a copy of limitless and it isn't original. A lot of it doesn't make sense and they try to make it seem like a Gotham type feel to the film but at the same time they don't so its kinda back and forth between two different worlds. And the logic makes no sense either that there is a pill that people can take that will either kill them or give them some sort of super power for a brief period of time which is totally absurd because no one would take a pill not knowing what it would do to them. Secondly, why do some people who take the pill only get the effect for a short period of time but then others, it seems, get it for longer periods of time? A lot of holes in the film and just overall poor writing and editing etc!
Netflix is really losing touch with what made them a success! What made Netflix wasn't the star power in films because it was a bunch of no names actors, directors, producers, etc that didn't have the name recognition but had the desire and passion to put forth a great product which made Netflix original content so successful! But nowadays it seems they are diverting towards a hollywood formula which relies on star power and this is an example! You have a famous actor but a horrible product verus unknown actors with a superb product that is original and FRESH! None of this film is FRESH! The ideas are used from previous films! Nothing about this film screams originality! Its all formulaic stuff that is stolen from other films like Batman, Limitless, etc.If Netflix doesn't get back to their old successful ways then Apple TV and Amazon are going to crush them by the end of this decade for sure! Or even half way through 2020s! They are losing all their content because Amazon is buying up all the old films and they are not making original content that is worth watching anymore! They are trying to copy everyone else and that is not what made Netflix a success! Even the Witcher is copied from Game of Thrones and trying to ride on its success but it doesn't work and its not a great show!",Project Power

It has decent action and effects and the main girl acting isn't bad, but the movie really should have just avoided trying to talk about the science of the superpowers because hooo boy it makes the movie sound so stupid.At one point, some chick takes a pill and starts making ice from her hands to the point where the room has to crank up the heat to keep her alive. The villain number 2 (who cares) says it's ""Thermoregulation"" and talks it up as some rare ability. But like, literally EVERY MAMMAL on the planet can thermoregulate because it's called being warm blooded and keeping your core temperature the same. A woman who needs a heat chamber to keep from freezing herself to death is the EXACT OPPOSITE of thermoregulation. Also, Jamie Foxx can vaporize things with plasma because he has pistol shrimp dna?

The characters and performances were good - Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Dominique Fishback. Since we're dealing with a pill that gives you unpredictable superpowers, each action sequence always felt fresh and unique. However, the plot follows familiar tropes with the odd dumb convenience to push the plot forward. Our villains were extremely underdeveloped and were just there to get their ass kicked. And besides Jamie Foxx and his story, not much else gets resolved with subplots seemingly forgotten. Even if the movie doesn't offer anything new or innovative besides its premise, there's definitely some fun to be had with this movie.Score: 6 out of 10

A great premise and setting wasted of a B-Tier buddy cop movie with some huge flaws. This movie has amazing up until Robin gets kidnapped, afterwards it tanked into a boring, pandering snoozefest.It would have been way more interesting if they stuck with Robin and Franklin as the leads. Franklin - a disgraced cop who relies on Power and Robin have a far more interesting relationship as enabler/supplier than psychotic dad paternal figure. I cannot state of much I despise Fox's character. They need to fire the writer who thought excusing kidnapping and being held hostage for the ""my daughter is jesus because military bad"" subplot. For every other scene in the movie, he sees Robin as her daughter but conveniently not when he was holding her hostage - which is exactly what the generic bad guys did - then proceeds to bribe and exploit Robin's daddy issues.

The script is absolutely horrible, what you see is exactly what you get with zero nuance. The villains in this movie are so generic and one dimensional that I don't even recall if they had names. Things are glossed over and haphazardly explained.The most glaring issue is the power pill itself. So this pill has a chance of giving you superpowers. There is also a chance it will make you explode killing you. Then if you do get a power it might be a crappy power which will either kill you or maim you with use. Oh and it lasts only five minutes.

Also, Casey Neistat has a cameo in this movie which I was excited for and he is in an action scene which was probably the worst action scene which I have seen in a while.All in all, this movie doesn't deliver you don't get a single good action scene, the characters don't feel fleshed out and they wasted something that could have been a good concept and if executed well we could have had an excellent sci-fi action movie.",Project Power

It is a great mix of a fast-paced storyline, terrific acting, and amazing stunt effects. Mind you, Project Power is no masterpiece but offers a strong dose of popcorn entertainment that will make this one a blockbuster hit for Netflix.
(Hindi mein bhi hai).The set-up is gritty. It is about this pill that unlocks different superpowers in every person who swallows it. Results may vary and the power will last for five minutes only.There is so much happening that you will not realize the duration of two hours. The direction is dynamic and fast along with brilliant work by the stunts and VFX teams. The pace of the movie is quite engaging where you have playful antics of Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Dominique Fishback. This chemistry between the three main leads- Jamie, Joseph, and Dominique are enjoyable.The plot has borrowed materials from comics like DC's Hourman and movies like Bradley Cooper's Limitless and also, X-Men. It mixes all of these and gives it a fresh spin of pure adrenaline.There are some weak points as well. The movie gets clumsy and looks messy at times. There is great chemistry between Jamie and Dominique but you don't get to see more of it. The action in the climax looks little 'less actionable' and the villains are just not that awesome.But you will ignore all of these errors as Jamie won't let you think of anything else when he is there on the screen. He is on fire and his role as a person looking for something (or someone) is simply brilliant. You will feel a strong sense of anger, desperation, and heroism at the same time.Joseph is no less than a great example of someone with raw and easy-going acting skills.

This clown described himself as a pistol shrimp, no joke.Clandestine supervillain scientists in search of angel investors to fund their dream of creating a population of substance abusing super-beings.And at the end of the day... it just flat out wasn't entertaining.

Very naieve, absurd and predictable story, the main characters are not deep-enough so that we can connect with them and eventually like them and it starts almost immediately with the action. There are a lot of forced cliche moments and it's just insulting for the average viewer.That diversity mania is fine if done right and balanced, but in this movie it's more like - black people good/decent , white people bad/evil.In general I give it 4/10 , if you have nothing else to watch, I mean literally nothing else, than don't watch it.",Project Power

At first I didn't think much of it, but in the later part of the movie it became apparent.
When you see this, you'll understand where I'm going with this, had you seen that Hulk movie that is...It did very well at the beginning, some unpredictable moves, surprising twists in logic (car scene at crossing - I'm not saying anything else, or I'll spoil it) that I didn't expect - Good one!But at the end they blew it when the movie gave sort of a ""Doh...""-moment of clarity at the big... Well, you know, the finale, showdown, last punch, bonanza etc.The effects took upper hand and became the cheesy stuff we've seen before.
They should've toned it down a little.
If they're making a sequel to this, you can't expect something less.
Sort of like they do with most movies today when they're stepping it up a notch for each iteration (For eg. Marvel).
But, back on topic.Expect a very promising beginning and middle, as for the ending.. Well, I think someone had hubris and was in a hurry there to get it done. It probably looked very good on paper.All things considered it's a watchable movie. I gave it 6 out of 10.

There are many super-zoom shots but they are not balanced with the right scene for super zoom shots. The film would also be a little better if it used more organized framing and cinematography. really a very good concept but lacking in terms of aesthetics. There are also some parts that I think are still being forced into the plot. I like the scoring tho, very intriguing.You can see here Joseph Gordon Levitt and Jamie Foxx really stand out in their quality of acting (Glad to See Levitt Back). of course, experience proves everything.

They do a great job playing their roles, and they look pretty badass doing so. Especially Jamie Foxx (if you know, you know).I personally haven't seen Dominique Fishback in anything before, but I'd like to see her in more roles too. I can tell she's talented, especially when it comes to emotional scenes.Now those were the highs, but here we go to the lows:As I was watching this, I kept thinking that the premise is interesting enough to be a Netflix show. A short season of episodes, maybe 45 mins-1 hour for each one-something like that.I don't want to spoil too much, but this movie had corrupt cops, teenage drug dealers, and a full on government conspiracy. I just wish we spent more time dealing with these issues. That's why I really wish this could've been a show.Even with all this, I still liked the movie. There were some good action scenes and the cast played their parts well. Netflix can easily continue this, BUT AS A SHOW PLEASE.

What more could you want from a good sci-fi action movie!?Yes the villains COULD have been explored in more depth but I think the protagonists only came into contact with the lower level thugs really so it works for this situation.

Not to mention being socially irresponsible - glorifying drugs and drug-dealing. The 'best' part is that the movie thinks it is 'heroic' for a student in a school to be a drug-dealer because your mother has diabetes!! How do these movies get made?

356,marksarko1,Alright,5,16 September 2020,"The idea of the film was able to break out of the ordinary a little bit, as it is an idea in a place in the middle between science fiction and reality and daily environment in the streets of New Orleans.Filming locations are very well selected and supported by a wonderful color montage , especially in the charming scenes , except that the cinematic plot didn't serve the story and the idea, it contains a lot of gapes, for example , Art's daughter was not introduced throughout the entire movie , there is only one Screenplay scene explains the reason for the kidnapping without focusing on how important she is. even when she is the main mark of the film's plot though.Good performance from professional actors, of course, the great Jamie Foxx and Gordon-Levitt, but the director did not give them enough space for creativity, the story has been compressed a lot, but it needs more details.The visual effects are the best part in the entire movie, it is amazing, especially when Detective Frank was shot in the head.

The effects are cool yep overhyped and diverge from the overall directing, lighting, photography and camera work that are very, very poor.
As for the rest, Netflix's recent ""musts"" are there: zero character development, horrible soundtrack for a movie (would work on a modern documentary about city life anywhere), basic dialogs in a very basic script, and a touch of Millenials juice that is just unnecessary since those bits add nothing to the story and are always forced into the plot.",Project Power

373,superruser-lr,Mo Powa Babeh !,6,15 August 2020,"Project Power tells the story of Art, Frank and Robin, working together to take down the group responsible of the traffic of a special pill that gives it's users super-powers for five minutes.I didn't expect too much of this movie, I just wanted it to be entertaining and fun... And that's exactly what I've got. It's not a surprise, because the directors were responsible for the movie Nerve, which was pretty good actually. The film is shot and edited in a way that is dynamic. They used wide lenses (18 mm lenses) on certain sequences to get more images in a frame. For exemple, when the story introduces Art, we see a building that it's bigger than usual, or when the camera is focused on a character in a pretty tight place, the character seems bigger than the environment around him : it gives more emphasis on a object or a character, or an action. When the camera moves, you got that feeling that it moves really fast, but it is just the wide lens that give this sensation. And the directors used that pretty well in the film, especially in action sequences. The lighting and the colors, like Nerve, are vivid and pleasant to the eye.The editing adds more to that dynamism. When someone took that pill, you don't see immediately the character getting power. Before that, you have brief cuts of some parts of the body reacting to the drug. Simply a simple influence from anime series. In action scenes, it cuts well, without loosing information when someone fight. VFX are pretty well handled, it doesn't really ruin your viewing experience... Maybe there is an escape sequence, minutes before the climax, that you can say that the effects were a bit too much to the eye, but overall it's good. You can't just be bored watching this.I freakin' love the cast for this film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jamie Foxx, and Dominique Fishback are the added bonuses of Project Power. The acting are strong. The alchemy between Foxx's and Fishback's characters, the dialogues are nice touches and give a little layer of emotion. Gordon-Levitt's character is not as good as the others though outside of it's comedic trait, but overall, they are all likable characters with some clear motivations.But there is a problem. Project Power has a lot of potentials with it's main concept... But it is poorly executed. Not badly, but we know what will happen in the story. There's no tension or suspense. The whole drug thing is unclear, unexplained. Why the super-powers stops exactly at five minutes? How this drug works? What are the stakes outside the one explain by one character at some point in the film? There are too much questions unanswered. Too bad that it lacks weight and depth to the concept, because there are so much occasions in the film to develop, to tackle some subjects. It would have definitively making some welcome differences compared to other super-heroes filled productions.It's the same thing for the characters. As I said previously, the protagonist have some clear motivations, but there's not enough backstory than the ones presented in the story. Art's quest is understandable, but we already saw that in other flicks before. Robin has the best scenes for her, but again, it lacks depth. The same thing happens between Robin and Art. We see the alchemy setting up throughout the story, but where's the pay-off? It's kinda underachieved.There are too much switching tones in the film. Sometimes it's very gory, but not too much, sometimes it's kinda sad but then it's fun... Don't know where the story want to go.Overall, it's an entertaining, likable film, with cool characters, cool actors, but it has it's flaws that can be crucial for certain viewers and lacks something to be very special, outside of it's main concept and visuals. Personally, I enjoyed it pretty much, especially during those uncertain times.",Project Power
374,suprchunk,The enthusiasm I will show is as high as the effort they put into this...,2,15 August 2020,"Meh! Drawn out, slow moving, poorly written and devised. Best adjectives I can use to describe this pile of mediocrity. They must have picked up a horrible script for pennies on the dollar and decided they'll just make up for it by overpaying well-established actors to try and save it.It didn't work. They must have been told they don't have to try very hard and can phone it in if they want. Because they definitely phoned it in. The premise is bizarrely reminiscent of a handful of sleeper hits, and not in an homage type of way, but in a blatant ""it worked for them, let's steal it"" kind of way. The plot is loose and scattered. The dialogue is uncomfortable. The visuals are nauseating at best. But they tried to cover that up with bright lights smearing across the screen.I'm not sure why they introduced so many characters either. They barely get screen time enough to show us why they are integral to the ""story"". And Machine Gun Kelly? Worst attempt at acting I have seen since the last movie his new gal was in.I'll learn to stop watching Netflix originals one day, hopefully sooner than later, because they barely deliver. Well, they don't deliver if I'm being honest. This makes three in a row of big-name helmed originals that they wasted money and time on. I'm also unsure how others can be as critical as they are and rate it at an average? If it is as bad as you say, rate it so people.

The ""next step"" in the string of mediocre Netflix blockbusters: >Project Power. Ordinary as they go just from the title. To put it plain and simple, this movie is basically the zenith of dejà vu. Everything it shows we have seen before (>Limitless being the most obvious source of ""inspiration"").So, the realm of originality is somewhere far beyond reach. Anyway, when you have taken into account the ordinary and derivative nature of it all, you can almost enjoy yourself. Almost.
Because, given its somewhat good premise, the movie could have been much much better and very much more entertaining.
But, being the end result as it is, it's just a matter of a pretty sad list:The plot. Well, the plot is just as much predictable as you could imagine and it's furthermore just a pretext;The script. It doesn't seem to know where to go at times, it ""gifts"" us with wanna-be funny one-liners and with a series of never-so-much one dimensional characters (especially the bad guys);The direction. It's simply a drab and can't quite manage to handle the action scenes, which are always messy or standard;The acting. It seems rather listless. There certainly are good actors like Foxx and Gordon Levitt here, but they don't seem all that interested (and given the material they had to work with you can understand why).There you go: the zenith of deja vu coupled with the apotheosis of the generic and sometimes stale.>Project Power seems at the very least intriguing at first (in the beginning, till the ""Human Torch"" scene), but the more it goes on the more you can't help yourself but wonder what it may have been if it had been written and directed by a better director and a better screenwriter. In that case maybe a 6 or 7 could've been reached.But - as the saying goes - you don't make history with the ""ifs"". As I already suggested, being the movie as it is, it's just mediocre. ""Watchable"" if you want, but mediocre nonetheless. And a tad little bit nonsensical if you ask me (and maybe it's really just me, but I'm thinking right now: why the hell would anybody want to take a pill that they don't even know if it's gonna work, how it's gonna work and that could pretty much disintegrate them right away?).",Project Power
392,AGuyNamedJake,"Unfortunately This ""Power Pill"" Packs No Punch",2,29 August 2020,"I recently re-binged watched ""The Boys"" on Amazon Prime in preparation for season 2. That show is a good example of how to take a GREAT idea and flesh it out into a well-built world with rich storytelling, great characters with clearly defined motivations, intrigue, humor, and all the bells and whistles plus tons of gore. It's a well-executed exploration of a unique concept.""Project Power"" on the other hand, seems to do exactly the opposite. It takes a unique concept and flushes it completely down the toilet. I'll tell you how they flush it right after this obligatory plot recap.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: A new drug flooding the streets promises to unlock a random superpower in users for five minutes at a time. The catch? It could just kill you... violently.The movie's flaws start right at the beginning. Instead of drawing us into this world where people can be superhuman, instead of giving us time to follow our heroes as they navigate a city being overrun by this new and deadly drug, we're thrust into the middle of the action. There's nothing wrong with jumping into a story's midpoint, but with so many characters and plot threads going on you've got to have a reason for doing that.Can you understand how confused audiences would've been if ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" was the first movie in the franchise? How would we have connected with Neo without first seeing his journey from human battery cell to freedom-fighting computer ninja? The world of ""The Matrix"" was so rich and complex that we needed that first movie to draw us in. It took it's time. And it worked.Granted, ""Project Power"" is nowhere near the complexity level of ""The Matrix,"" but it's rich enough that a more fleshed out introduction would've helped. It's easy to miss important story beats and emotional queues when you're still struggling to figure out who the good guys are.In terms of story, characters, subtext, and fun, there's so much more the filmmakers could've done. They foolishly stick to run-of-the-mill action movie beats, even if some of the action scenes are pretty cool--Jamie Foxx's fight with the guy on fire has got to be some ground-breaking special effects work!Still, there's no central bad guy. There's no third act twist that pulls the rug out from under you and flips the story on its head in an awesome way--like when Neo figured out how to see ""The Matrix"" coding and blow up Agent Smith. Damn, that was cool!""Project Power"" is rich with potential: a cop who isn't afraid to take the drug so long as it means he catches the bad guy, to a father struggling to find his missing daughter who may just be the catalyst for everything. It sounds like a great starting point, but it's all wasted.The visuals look cool though. The cinematography has a unique look and the superpowers are creatively showcased, but, in the end, it doesn't help.If 2020 hadn't turned into the demon from hell that it became and we had a booming summer movie season, ""Project Power"" would've been a box office flop that nobody would've remember by Christmas. Unfortunately, none of us have much to do right now, so give it a watch. It'll pass the time until ""The Boys"" season 2 comes out or you decide to rewatch ""The Matrix.""",Project Power
393,ReelVillain,Marvelz In Da Hood,8,18 August 2020,"Marvelz In Da HoodIn a time when we are all sorely missing Titans destroy each other on the big screen, Netflix has offered us an alternative, Project Power. A film directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, the same duo to bring us Catfish and Nerve. So the reel question is will this Noir Superhero film is will be more Hell Boy or more well Hell boy (you know THAT version)?Films like Project Power fascinate me, those that deliberately merge 2 genres. I find them brave, bold, and different. That is not to say they are all perfect, they can often be complete train wrecks like the woefully misjudged Bright, but for the most part, I respect an attempt at creativity. This is where we find Project Power, somewhere between the absurd and the important.Make no mistake for all of its fritters with the fantastical and violently heavy CGI sequences Project Power has a very clear and distinctive message. This is a film not about superpowers but about the struggles that ordinary people face every single day. It is no coincidence the film is set in New Orleans. Somehow the entire film tries to make a deep social commentary on the state of BLM and while speaking about the shockwaves left in New Orleans after the catastrophic floods several years ago. The remarkable thing is, the film succeeds.I feel the deeper messages sew into Project Power is what attracted Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon Levitt to the feature, while both are major players, this is Dominique Fishback show. She portrays a realistically take on the struggles of a young black girl growing up in absolute poverty with only a glimmer of hope left.Ironically the main thrust to see the film judging by its promotional material is to entice curiosity. This is the same hook that is used on all the addicts in the film. They need to know what their hidden power it too. What is your power? That is how the movie draws us in. What is your potential?Now obviously there are the more common powers to choose form flight, super strength, super speed, but Project Power longs to dig a little deeper than that, it wants to be more ambitious with its choices, leading to many of the easy superpowers to be nothing more than footnotes. Even after this fact Project Power is surprisingly controlled with its use of the drugs and showing the users' abilities. I also appreciate that the film even attempts to justify how these powers manifest and why in a real-world setting.As usual, the downfall of Project Power is the same as all superhero films, the villains. These are all without character or storyline. A room full of thugs in various degrees of difficulty. This follows to another slightly harder room full of goons. It's a small objection to a film that is more about Rapping than it is about capes.Project Power has the guts to hold back on the incredible to make the film remarkable.8 jagged little pills out of 5",Project Power

Frank (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has resorted to working with a local drug dealer and aspiring rapper Robin (played by Dominique Fishback) to level the playing field. But when an ex-soldier Art (played by Jamie Foxx) comes to New Orleans to find his missing daughter, these three must team up to discover the hidden secrets behind this superhero pill.As an elevator pitch, this really seems like a producer's wet dream. There's the superhero aspect that is always profitable (when done correctly or not) as well as name talent with Foxx and Gordon-Levitt being attached, it would seem like a slam dunk. While Netflix continues to invest billions into its films and is working to distance itself from the ""It's a Netflix film"" negative connotations, 'Project Power' is an empty attempt at enticing superhero fans and winds up leaving no lasting mark on the genre.I mean it when I say I like this premise, it's just that the directors and writers decided to not focus on any of the fun aspects of it. You expect to see more creativity to the so-called ""powers"" to be able to rise above the competitive landscape of films in this genre. Instead, it's a copy-paste of any X-Men film but take out the motivations, the characters, and the entertainment value. Forced cameos from YouTube stars are painfully obvious, like opening the film with Machine Gun Kelley. The acting by Jamie Foxx and JGL is fine, they both pull off their characters albeit round the 2-dimensional arcs out more than what they could be with another star. The stand-out performance for me comes from Dominique Fishback, who could've been the heart of the film had they expanded her character to more than just ""the Robin to Jamie Foxx's Batman"". Her love of rap is barely focused on and could've been fleshed out in the end instead of focusing on Foxx's stale arc of a father looking for his daughter.Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character has no backstory, and only serves the base purpose of being likable and on the side of the law. Every character feels like they are from their own film but forced into this superhero narrative that isn't explored enough to justify it being there. Films like ""Limitless"" with Bradley Cooper do a better job of showing the world-building and consequences of the object in question, a pill that enhances abilities. Yes, there is you're 'John Wick' style of lighting, some decent fight choreography, and when the effects are in play for the superheroes they don't appear to be like a Playstation 3 cutaway. But this is all things you'd expect from a titan like Netflix, but it cannot save the shallow storytelling from watering down the quality of the film significantly.Overall, I didn't have a great time with this. It feels long, there's not a lot to cling to that's exploratory or adds to the genre. It's got great actors in it but overall what they are chewing on as far as the story goes is bland, and forgettable.I'm giving 'Project Power' a 5/10What did you think of the film? leave a comment down below and make sure to follow this site for all things Geeky!

397,eaveschristopher,Fresh Take on Super Powers with Rubbish Villians.,7,16 August 2020,"Project Power Micro Review -The city of New Orleans is under siege from a new street drug which unlocks its users inner super power for five minutes or causes them to explode. The film shifts away from a traditional depiction of ""Superman"" style powers being empowering wonderment to being seen as unnatural, frightening and eerie. Project Power has personality, style and fantastic protagonists but lacks real narrative weight from its villains.When Jamie Foxx, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback are on screen the film works. The directors give these characters moments to breath and grow alongside each other. Unfortunately, the villains are all complete rubbish. There are two exposition sequences that dictate the motivations of the villains as being they are villains. Eventually the main bad is revealed late in the third act but is regulated to running around yelling orders for her Goons to ""get them!"" This is disappointing because there is so much potential for drama between the villain and Jamie Foxx's motivation.Project Power's concept, style and protagonists are all fantastic. The film has great lighting design and the action, while featuring some shaky cam cam, is clear in what is happening. Especially one clever long take action sequence shot from inside a tank. Project Power has much more to love than to be frustrated with. Although, I was shocked to learn the film had a 85 million dollar budget. I would have guessed 20 to 30. So that's not too great.",Project Power

401,neiloconnor-98432,Another mediocre effort from Netflix,5,18 August 2020,"One thing is for sure, Netflix is consistent. Its impressive that they can churn out dozens of average, mediocre movies without once ever rising to the level of greatness, or even very good territory. You would think that just by accident they'd release a great movie sooner or later. Nope. And It can't be easy being so consistently meh. With Project Power, their mediocre movie streak remains fully intact.I have to wonder, why would an actor of Jamie Foxx's caliber risk putting out a Netflix clunker and tarnishing his image? They must be paying him well. As for the other ""actors"", not so much. And They're clearly scouring film school campuses for student directors willing to work on the cheap.Maybe someday we'll get something great from Netflix.

403,keridb,I really enjoyed this concept,8,10 September 2020,">>NO Spoilers- but some plot references<<
As a big fan of SciFi/Fantasy books & movies I found this movie very entertaining. The concept is not only fresh but plausible.
We follow two main characters; a young woman (Robin), and an older guy (Major). Both on different spectrums of the same journey. And when their paths converge, the epic adventure truly begins.
The acting is actually very good; with Joseph Levitt & Jamie Fox giving stellar/believable performances.
The cinematography is not overused and tastefully done. The CG is so artfully incorporated, you may hardly notice.There are a couple plot holes /or/ unanswered questions....but its balanced. For example- we never found out what happened to the South American lady after the ""demonstration"" was disbanded. And though that could lend to a sequel....if one never comes, this movie is still viable as a stand-alone.
One of my favorite parts is the ending- for two reasons:
1. Our curiosity is sated. And
2. They didn't take the predictable path with Robin.There are some SJW moments, but no matter your stance on that- it is not overwhelmingly political...and even pokes a little fun at itself; if you have a sense of humor.On a side note... If you were hoping for a serious acting debut from Machine gun Kelley, you will be disappointed. His part is kin to a cameo. But for me, his overall absence is negligible if you really focus on the story being told.
In the end- I would recommend....and I truly hope they make another.",Project Power

Not so in Project Power. Netflix's action-thriller offers an intriguing tweak to the superhero mythos - here, those who take a 'Power' pill are gifted supernatural abilities for just five minutes per hit and they don't know what hidden ability they hold until they take one.Despite finding a fresh angle on one of cinema's most oversaturated genres, Project Power never fully capitalises on that potential. Like the streaming service's other summer genre exercise The Old Guard, its hooky premise is trapped in a generic plot involving a shadowy organisation led by a cabal of boring baddies.Project Power has considerable style yet a disappointing lack of substance - but an attention-grabbing performance from Dominique Fishback and an intriguing twist on superpowers give it just enough juice.",Project Power

Villains that are similar to other comics have been recycled . Too many characters mean that none of them get enough time on the screen to develop into their own selves. a guy who can become a flame, the hint at a person who could regenerate limbs like a lizard, a person who can actually heal someone etc etc.
a big explosion happens when one person overdosed but nothing happens to the apartment complex; the people in the complex already seem to know what that particular did etc.
the story is weak. the actors have done good work but that won't make the movie into a blockbuster. the acting however, makes sure that you are not bored.

A shadey government/ Big Pharma type has produced a pill, not a painkiller (although it might kill you in tremendous pain) one that grants the user a superpower for the arbitrary time of 5minutes. And in typical shadey government/ Big Pharma fashion they decided to run clinical trials of the pill trusting the drug dealers and criminals of New Orleans to give them accurate results and information on how well the pill works!!!!
They also use this as a showcase to start a bidding war between criminal organisations wanting to get their own supply.
Robin (Dominique Fishback)is one such super pill dealer but she only deals so she can provide for her sick mom (even though the pills Robin has sold have probably been used in numerous crimes and resulted in many deaths but she's got an heart of gold) Robin is also a talented rapper and dreams of making it big (She can also treat and sow up bullet wounds) she's a triple threat.
Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a tough New Orleans cop so sick of his city being overrun by superpowered miscreants that he starts buying pills from Robin in hope that it will somehow level the playing field (For some reason he appears to be the only cop that does this) to help fund his habit he pays Robin by giving her a dirt bike he stole from the impound lot..(Robin can also ride motorcycles of any size and horsepower).
The Major (Jamie Foxx) is a man on a mission trying to track down his missing daughter. Only The Major is not what he seems (SPOILER he's got superpowers) which due to tragic accident he doesn't like to use (until he definitely has to at the end of the film) in a drawn out series of events and coincidences all the heroes cross paths and team up to bring down the shadey super pill producing organisation and rescue The Majors daughter(SPOILER she has powers too which is being syphoned by the bad guys to produce the pills).I was so excited for this movie, the trailer looked amazing (suckered once again) plus Foxx and JGL are top actors but sadly this is definitely style over substance. A basic plot that requires smart people to do and say dumb things to keep the story going. Bad guys so boring and inept they don't feel like a threat to Robin let alone Frank and The Major.

I like the whole imaginary reaction of going off on the teacher, but that ""technique"" (a character imagines an outlandish sequence of events, then ""wakes up"" to the reality where that didn't and won't happen) seems out of place when it's the only time you use it. Actually, they could've used that technique throughout, made the whole thing one of her ""daydreams"" and it would've made her character more relevant!I thought the effects were decent although some VERY bad scenes hold them back as a whole. I thought the scene where the camera is in the circular cell with ""freeze girl"" was well shot and brought the feeling of claustrophobia while also being encompassed by the action outside the glass cell. However, the generic Hispanic druglord's ""Jekyll-like"" beast mode was silly looking..It feels like there were some plot holes too, but more along the lines of being unbelievable. For example, this teenage girl just kinda walks into this highly guarded area, and then they cut to her being inside the boat? Is she a freakin ninja?

Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt both killed their roles as usual, and it was great to see Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a new Action movie! He always does great. The sequence with MGK (Machine Gun Kelly) in the beginning really set the Tone for the whole movie, and the set design of that scene was SICK! Newcomer Dominique Fishback did an excellent job as well. Her Rap skills were Top Tier! I really thought it was a great film. Netflix really knows how to make a good watch.

The casting is great and main characters are likeable and easy to relate to. I appreciate R rating. It has flying limbs in it, exploding bodies, enough slow motion scenes to enjoy the effects. Different powers are just great. What I liked the most is the original score by Joseph Trapanese. It fits perfectly. All in all, this is a perfect summer blockbuster!",Project Power

It has one of the coolest premises for superhero movies in the past years and the VFX are pretty good but the story is so all over the place and the style of filming is annoying (at least for me) that made me speed-watch it.Jamie Foxx does a good job, JGL as well but the actress who plays the Robin character is annoying for some reason.

It's much more than your standard super-dudes trading punches. They really show how dangerous these sorts of abilities can be.Aside from that, it seems there's alot of real world problems they seem to draw comparisons to. Drugs, government sketchiness, family hardship, natural disaster, and even a bit of PTSD. It seems like alot, but they manage to pull it off without you thinking about it too much.My only gripe is that they remind you they're in NOLA every 5 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen a movie mention the name of the city so many times, or drop other direct references so often.

478,healingpampered,Better than most major studio releases,9,19 August 2020,"If you can look past the wildly implausible premise, which you have to with every superhero movie, Project Power is a knockout punch of a movie.Dressed up as a Summer Action Blockbuster, this film actually sneaks in heaping helpings of heart, humor, pathos and clever storytelling that all add up to a truckload of fun for the viewer with her/his willing suspension of disbelief glasses firmly affixed.Without the three leads, this film would just be forgettable eye candy. But the casting director(s) made a wise decision not only in snagging Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt but mostly in choosing Dominique Fishback for the role of Robin. She steps up and goes toe to toe with both of these A-listers in scene after scene. She is the heart and soul of this film and the main reason that it works as a character piece and affecting drama.Things don't really start clicking into place until after the first 15 or 20 minutes but after that everything falls together nicely. Little throwaway jokes or visual gags come back around later with deeper meaning attached. Just when you think you know where the bottom is, the floor gives way again.The visual style has flair without bring gimmicky. The dialogue is fresh and immediate without being forced or overwritten. The performances are all polished without coming off as brash or showy.This is one of the best Netflix productions to date and hopefully it will boost the already ascending profile of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman as well as pull Dominique Fishback's acting resume to the top of casting directors' lists from Toronto to Tokyo. This young lady has an Oscar in her future.Project Power is an exciting, fun film worth checking out for fans of Sci-Fi Action films.",Project Power

But that was about all that was actually explained to the viewer. There were lots of plot holes and background that was either VERY briefly explained or never explained. Getting to understand Jaime Foxx's character involvement in it all would have made it more interesting and make the ending feel more redeeming. Would've liked to see Jason Gordon-Levite's character and Foxx's come together earlier and seen the relationship develop more.

The way they specifically decided to shot and zoom in at different points of the film added to the overall vibe. Additionally, the overall aesthetic built off of this. The bright background and interesting filming choices were the 1st things that made me want to be in this world.The fact that this movie gives a new twist of the storyline of mutant type people who have cracked the secrets of evolution, ......you would expect them to show us powers. Well, they delivered. For a Netflix original, this had GREAT CGI. I really enjoyed the way they showed how the ""Power"" (pill) affected its users on a molecular level. Alongside that, the sequences of people using their powers and fighting were full of action.Now, I also enjoyed the main cast. Both Art (Jamie Foxx) and Frank (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) had a great dynamic with Robin( Dominique Fishback). They both seemed to be very protective over her even though they've both only known her for a little bit. And, each character had a good background story especially Art.Overall, this movie for me is 9.5/10. I want more of this movie.....of this concept.

I can't say it's revolutionary or anything but it does a good job of being what it is. Which is the R rated X-men. Only, the mutants are mutants thanks to little pills. They were entertaining for sure and did justice to their role. But there should have been more. Action scene in the bar was shot in the worst way possible. Camera inside Chamber didn't show anything interesting of that scene, apart from special effects work. there are big flaws in the sound production, and the use of score with a volume button turning up and down each time there are dialouges are cheap and unescesarry. the sound management has forgotten how much noise a moving ship makes. and the calmity of the calamity make the silence airpinning irritating.

Love to see her next projects.Of course, there are some prosaic lines and repetitive scenes, but if you consider the movie as its lone entity, I think it was really well done.

528,dorohedoro99,I'm surprised nobody mentions Terra Formars!,5,25 August 2020,"So, it goes like this...
There's this manga called Terra Formars which got an anime and real-life action movie directed by none other than legend Takashi Miike. The whole concept of scientists creating a way to incorporate animal characteristics and abilities to humans, some of them compatible and others not and specifically the whole biology lesson about the praying mantis shrimp is completely and shamefully stolen from this manga.
Even a scene that tries to explain DNA technology and abilities of other animals specifically the regenerative ability of planarians, is again something very stricking on Terra Formars.This writer could have done it right if he proposed to write a proper Terra Formars script for Hollywood, have them pay for rights etc and then we would actually have an even better, more interesting and full plot!
I will not even talk about the directing and editing, as the result was so erratic and misleading and the only memorable moments where just the actors faces and some incredible special effects but basically in slow motion as everything else tends to be a blurr otherwise.It is a shame for the actors, it is a shame for the special effects people, it is a shame for us viewers who want to support our favourite actors and want to enjoy a well written plot!",Project Power

Her acting is so much less than JF and JGL's, and her screen time is about the same as those two. This makes the movie extremely annoying to watch.What I do not understand is why A list actors such as JF and JGL participate in these type of (Netflix) movies?

As a comic book fan of the 80's and 90's, I'm a sucker for ""powered"" hero flicks. And I enjoyed the movie Limitless. So, I'm probably predisposed to at least WANT to like this movie.There were times when it looked like the movie was going to head in a bad direction, but it always righted itself. Not without its flaws, but has enough delightfully good moments to overlook them.Really good visualFX work too by the way. And I'm sure it was on a budget.

538,dkyforever,This movie was awesome!,10,22 August 2020,"Ok, truth be told, I'm writing this review due to the mind numbingly awful reviews of so many other people.
And yes, I actually and unironically enjoyed this movie.
Here's my list of good stuff to be found in this flick(in no particular order)1. Overall great story. Many reviews said this movie was stale or terrible, but it wasn't bad at all. There was a beginning, middle and end. It was not hard to follow. The story made sense. The dialog was realistic as was the acting. From time to time the dialog felt a bit rushed, but in the context, it fit the scene.
2. There was a lack of swearing. I don't know if I saw a different version of this movie than some of the other reviewers, but I appreciated it. It's so rare nowadays to see a solid action flick and NOT hear a continuous stream of profanities. Even the raps the girl spit were free of cussing. That actually surprised me.
3. Action scenes were solid and easy to follow. I was never confused about who everyone was. The only scene where there was any confusion was in a situation that made sense in the scheme of the story. A few factions all drawing guns on each other out of their own confusion made sense to me. It was all resolved rather quickly anyway.
4. The rapping was amazing! Honestly, that's my favorite style of rap. Intellectual. The idea that the main character was doing poorly in school but had such lyrical presence has certainly been used before, but the freestyle raps she did were well executed, easy to follow and sounded awesome! There were only two scenes. One was a daydream and the other was to prove that she had some real skills.
5. FX were really good. I notice some people said that they were poor but honestly they surprised me at how good they were. Nothing looked or felt cheap. The burning man was seriously sweet, the ""Biggie"" character hulked out nicely, though maybe ""Abomination"" would be a better reference. The scene of Joseph's headshot was surprising and looked incredible. The chameleon dude was really well done. Overall, I was thrilled with the different powers and their explanations.
6. Overall acting by the cast was better than I expected. All of the characters felt nicely fleshed out and gave realistic performances. Their interactions were not the typical ""that's not how people talk"" type that take me out of the experience. People in the film gave realistic performances that I related to. My favorite films are the ones where I have my own response to a scene and then a character responds the same way. That happened often in this one.
Jamie and Joseph were fantastic and each brought a lot to their characters. They felt realistic with their own wants, needs and desires. They didn't come off as hokey or inaccessible. I really liked the dichotomy of the two men and the inclusion of a young woman who portrayed the streets in a realistic way. Her mom was great too.
Others have said this was already done with the movie Limitless. I haven't seen that one yet, so I'm not comparing this to anything else. (and this comes from a comic nerd!)
Overall, I thought this was a very compelling movie that would be great as a series of movies or even a tv series. There is still a lot that could be expanded on if they want to.
I have seen a bunch of B movies recently, and this was not even in the same ballpark.",Project Power

The movie starts well, builds and develops characters logically and with consideration given to the audience, it doesn't feel forced or over drawn. The cast is perfect for the main characters, script is well done, only the villains seem a little on the weak side as far as character development goes.

You see some super powers but it feels almost like the special effects or cgi involved in bringing these powers to the screen was too expensive so they had to limit the visualisation of these powers in places.They don't even really stand out and or come across as particularly special as you regularly see people with supposed super powers defeated by a guy without any simply by hand to hand combat. In my opinion this whole element of the film was poorly realised and had very little thought applied to it.There is some ok acting, I guess its the bigger names and the concept that keep it watchable.The writing is shocking. Pretty sure at the beginning I heard one of the characters say her mum had diabetes and was waiting for her operation.....So many terrible inconsistencies plague this film . I am not even going to go into them as there are so many. I will share in my opinion one of the most ridiculous and it is a spoiler.The main character is basically completely surrounded and decides to go out and take a pill to unleash his superpower. His super power is to become a human explosion of some sort blasting everything around him. Somehow he was able to know this despite it resulting in his death?!? The best bit is that the rap girl he is trying to save is ten feet from him and despite the blast literally destroying everything ground up and everyone in 100m sphere around him, she survives by simply dropping to the floor as the explosion is midway. The 50 or so enemies all completely disappear despite being further away then the rapper girl.Its ridiculous and these sort of what and how moments crop up repeatedly.Its just a rushed low quality job in which no one really put any thought into it past the concept.",Project Power

Almost as if the writers took a lunch break half way through and never came back. But this movie on the other hand was great! It was everything I expected it to be and was the perfect Friday night Netflix and chill movie, I even ended up showing the wife what power I had afterwards if you know what I mean; clearly she enjoyed the film too.

By no means is this a bad movie. Sure it has it's issues but nobody would recommend this movie as the next Schindler's List. It's just a fun little movie with some cool moments and decent acting from Foxx and Levitt. My only issue with the film was the awkward decision of making a 29 year-old play a high school girl but all in all I would recommend this if you want to munch some popcorn and have a fun time.

The story line was a bit bland, the bad guys were a bit superficial but the acting of the main characters was good, the concept of powers in pills was actually a great and unique one and the special effects were good. They could have made better use of this but nonetheless not bad at all. I think this movie was better than many of the previous new films and series of Netflix.

Whilst watching it I would have given it an over generous 6.5/10 however when Casey Neistat appeared on the screen I reduced it to 5/10. I don't know if he got put in the film as a favour to someone, I can't imagine him being a ""box office"" draw, and I suspect there will be people who won't see it because he's in it.As an aside, Netflix is a interesting case study, they have all the data a studio could dream of about what people like down to the second level (though they lost useful information when they dropped scoring to protect Any Schumer) but seem to have a battle between woke talent and the data they have about what people actually want.

A quick read of the synopsis would tell you what you are in for. Not sure why the ""Artsy"" reviewers even bothered! Oh well I guess being negative is the latest fad. Anyway, I enjoyed this movie very much! Also being a native , I am so glad they didn't give the New Orleanian characters Cajun accents! This movie is one of the few that nailed our accent.

The whole point of the powers is that you do not know what you're going to get, except when it suits the writers and you know almost exactly what you're going to get.The movie also doesn't know what it wants to be. Do we want to be a story about a girl who wants to rap and overcome her fear of speaking in public? Do we want to be a story about a father being reunited with his daughter? Do we want to be a sci-fi flick about superheroes with a twist? The movie cannot decide what it wants to do on the most basic level.I cannot go deeper into this film without getting into spoiler-zone, but in short - the film looks like it had material for 3 separate films to be made and instead they made a monster put together from the corpses of all 3 films.",Project Power

This movie too me through a mind-blowing new way of thinking of Super Hero movies..
It had all of my friends talking of an alternate way of how Mutants can be created and deep conversations on DNA manipulation in the future where we can alter ourselves temporarily for fun..

673,mikeacrawshaw,"Better than I expected, but still a wasted opportunity",6,16 August 2020,"The basic premise - a new narcotic gives the user a ""superpower"" of some sort for 5 minutes. A cop and an ex-army SF guy want to take down the dealers. With the excellent Jamie Foxx and JGL playing the leads, this had a lot of potential, that unfortunately it just doesn't quite reach.
The action is mediocre. Additional characters are shallow and ill-defined. The bratty kid with a heart of gold (of course!) was stereotyped and annoying at best, and I found myself half-hoping for her to catch a stray round to teach her a lesson about not going into dangerous places when she's been told to stay put.
There were some good moments. When JGL interrupted some shady special agents ""interviewing"" the brat's mother, I genuinely laughed out loud - it was beautifully done, and that scene alone lifted this a star.
The ""powers"" element was a mixed bag. The unpredictability of the powers and the possibility of OD was a good aspect, which added an edge. Would you be super-strong or just explode? The ""5-minute effect"" was nonsensical. The power ran out 5 minutes, to the second. People were setting their watches and you could see the runout bang on time. A little variation where it expired after 3-8 minutes, faster on bigger people, for example, would have made more sense and added tension. The powers were alternately ridiculous (human torch style flames) or underwhelming (Luke cage style bulletproof that alternately saw the user knocked out or unfazed by gunfire, depending on the plot requirements at the time). You also got the same power every time you take the drug, which removed the unpredictability after the first dose.
It was ok. It kept us entertained for a couple hours. But it could have been so much more with a tighter script, more attention to the additional characters, and a bit more imagination with the titular ""powers"".",Project Power

For example, the girl drug dealer having a passion for rap.. literally has no connection to any of the story but there's too much focus on it. Most of the story is pretty predictable, cliché ""dad kicks ass trying to get his daughter back from the government"".

Tasteful and brief, as they should be, a few honorable cameos can be spotted throughout the film with lots of room to extend the universe with some reappearances and world building in a sequel. Taking a step away from the borderline campy vibes from your average superhero movie, Project Power deliveries on action packed variety of powers and sets a realistic take on how the world around them might react. Clever storytelling gives a believable reasoning to the origin of the plot alongside real world issues such as political corruption and societal influences of a broken system bearing down on your average citizen, giving well rounded character development and fluid relationship building between the characters. Every bit of dialogue builds to the next scene without cliche expectations of the characters winking into the camera as so many movies do and keep the audience compelled throughout its entirety - as a smoker, it shocked me to realize two hours had come and gone by the finale.

716,jessejamessetterberg,POWER-ful Movie!,10,25 September 2020,"When you think of superpowers you probably think of Spiderman or maybe a character from a different universe like The Flash. But Project Power demonstrates superpowers in a very different way. A movie full of explosions and superpowers, what's not to like? Project Power fills viewers with suspense and continuously awes you in almost every scene. Based in the harsh parts of New Orleans this movie shows many different aspects of life; the rich, the poor, and the powerful. Power, the main object that the storyline revolves around, is not what you would normally think it would be. In this movie power is a drug, in the pill form, that can do much more to a person than an ordinary pill. Throughout this movie, the kidnappings, the shootings, and the corrupt policeman, you see what life would be like if a powerful drug like this existed.
The New Orleans, also known as ""The Big Easy"", is known to have two sides when it comes to the city. Simply put there is the nice and the not so nice. ""Project Power"" takes place in the not so nice; this is perfect for the group of drug dealers spread out throughout the city. In this movie you see all types of people trying to get their hands on these sought after drugs. But this pill is far too dangerous to remain on the streets of New Orleans. Art played by Jamie Foxx is on a mission to find the source of this pill in order to stop its production and accomplish a deeper goal. With his skills in hand to hand combat and his expertise in shooting he has the credentials and drive to do what it takes to find the creator of Power. Because this creator of the drug, ""took something, and Art has got to get it back""(Art). But, he will need more than his skills to get what he needs. He needs someone who knows the streets.
Robin, the struggling high-schooler and wanna-be the rap star, is an awesome character. Full of dreams and drive; this character takes the movie to an emotional place and separates it from the constant action seen in every scene. Robin does whatever she needs to do to take care of herself and her family, but in New Orleans doing whatever it takes can get you involved with the wrong people. Being involved with drugs and dealers, Robin knows the streets of New Orleans like the back of her hand, which will come in handy when she meets Art. Although she likes to say she's just a child, Art reminds her, ""You out here in these streets dealing you ain't no damn kid""(Art). But these streets can get dangerous -- luckily Robin is not alone, she has a cop on her side.
Frank, a police officer and clearly a fan of the saints, as seen throughout the movie, is on a mission of his own. Power has taken over the city and these drug users are dangerous. Frank sees that the only way to level the playing field is to get dangerous himself. I guess it's a good thing he has a relationship with Robin, the local Power dealer. Frank is also a great character. When it comes to a movie like this, with shootouts and drugs that give you superpowers, it seems that Frank is -- bulletproof. He plays a huge role in both Robin's and Art's Quest throughout the movie.
Now let's get back to Power, made by a company called Teleios that is clearly hoping to rule the world, this drug is still in its testing phases. These superpowers aren't always obtained, sometimes it's a casket instead, which makes this movie even more suspenseful when the drug is ingested. The company who makes it knows this, which is why they have local drug dealers distributing power for testing. Art explains to Robin that, ""the people that she's selling to, they're the lab rats""(Art). Through this experiment, Teleios hopes to receive funding from rich locals and South American drugs lords with no intentions of stopping the production of Power. You can see why this movie pushes you beyond excitement, superpowers, drug lords, and did I mention explosions? Yes. Lots of explosions!
Besides taking place in the city of New Orleans the main parts of this movie take place on a massive boat called Genesis. This is where you'll see many people with many different powers! Some of the most exciting scenes happen during this time of the movie! Throughout this movie there is a battle between the good and the evil. The powerful and the powerless. But it comes down to who has the most will power. What are they fighting for? Is it to do good for all or to harm the world?
This movie is like no other. Not often do you see a drug that can give you superpowers like these. Usually you would need a radioactive spider or a jolt of lighting, but no, just a simple pill can give you more power than a nuclear missile. This is what makes this movie so magnificent, such a small object has so much power.
Project Power is overall an awesome movie to watch. This movie is full of excitement and always keeps the audience's attention! When watching this movie, keep in mind that Power has the potential to change the world. But, will it change it for the good or for the bad? Will Art, Robin, and Frank succeed in their missions or will Teleios and the South American drug cartels get what they truly desire? Like Uncle Ben says, 'With great power comes great responsibility', minus the radioactive spider.",Project Power

The last sci-fi storyline I enjoyed so much was Freaks (2018).The special effects, though not groundbreaking or overwhelming, are worthy of any recent blockbuster - in quality if not in quantity.Dominique Fishback was also a revelation for me, a wonderful talent. She held the whole thing together magnificently. My loss for being unfamiliar with her other work. Jamie Foxx and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deliver the acting goods, but frankly, I expect no less.(The only reason I'd knock a point or so off a perfect 10, was that right at the very end, the real-life men with the money made it a bit too obvious that they were leaving the door open for a sequel.)Well worth anybody's time.",Project Power

741,Kaylea-lloyd,"Great Idea, Poorly Executed",5,15 August 2020,"I was really looking forward to this but unfortunately I finished the film feeling disappointed.It started off well, showing us why Robin was selling the drug, Frank's good argument for using power despite being a cop and Art's search for his daughter.Though Robin proved to be the weak link in this story. I do believe she was used to suggest that we each have our own type of power but not by literally possessing a physical power. We're all can be powerful without being bullet proof for example.Though her sudden relationship with Art wasn't believeable and almost uncalled for. Even though I think the point was for Art to help her see her potential, I didn't feel it. She had a better, more understandable relationship with Frank.Art's search for his daughter was more believeable but felt rushed. If more time had lapsed in his search for her and possibly more desperation and seeing more of the lengths he would go to find her would have strengthened this relationship. Possibly replacing Robins screen time with more of Tracy's point of view and seeing her struggle with her powers etc.The most disappointing part for me was when Art gets captured on the boat and is talking about a shrimp. There could have been a great twist there but nope.....Ultimately, it used all its energy at the beginning and then fell flat for rest of the film. I didnt really emotionally connect with the characters other than maybe Frank. He was the most believeable in his pursuit to protect the people of New Orleans. Even if he did have a typical cliche moment in the film that you can see coming a mile away.Honestly they should have just used Art and Frank buddying up earlier in the movie and have them both go beserk looking for Tracy and getting rid of the drug. I think that would have been more believeable.What a waste of an amazing group of actors.",Project Power

There are so many ""normal people coming into random superpowers"" movies/tv shows nowadays but I always like to give them a chance. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a NOLA cop alongside Jamie Foxx, a former Major in the Army(?)... two big A-Listers (although JGL has been out of the movie scene for a while), acting from both of them was superb, however the execution of the layout of the movie was awful. I think if this had been put out as a television show, this could have had more background built up and a way bigger plot than ""catch the bad guy and save the girl before they get away."" Great great concept, however it was too big of a concept to be successfully laid out in just an hour and 54 minutes. Honestly, I expected better. In the past year or so Netflix has seemed to hit it out of the park in the Television show department, but its movies are always sickeningly cliche and rushed.

745,wbloom-856-246104,Humdrum Net-flick You Can Afford to Miss,3,23 August 2020,"One would think that two A-listed actors and Netflix track-record would assure two hours of quality entertainment. Wrong.The movie was down-right boring and unengaging. There is very little dialogue, very few characters excluding the various people that need beating up, the story line is disjointed and the ending entirely anti-climactic. There was potential for better world building but they missed it.There are two things in which the movie succeeds. The first is the woke-agenda. The movie centers primarily around young African-American females rather than on the main male characters and there is a scene in the movie which deliberately drives the point home just in case you might miss it.
The African-American females - Downtrodden by The Man (you won't miss the scene) but strong and virtuous none the less.
The African-American lead character - Just wants to get to his daughter back. Does what it takes but never does anything morally dubious.
The European-American lead character - Is a good guy but does do morally dubious things where the ends justify the means.
The antagonists, except for a henchman or two, are all European-Americans although one is a female. But she's smart, calculating and determined - and she's the boss.The second thing in which the movie succeeds is the special effects. Very well done and some effects were quite innovative. Kudos to the FX department.If you're a 16 year-old African American girl this movie is awesome. For the rest of us? Meh.",Project Power

Unfortunately, those expectations failed to be met.The first act of the movie is quite strong. I enjoyed the concept act of being able to gain a power from taking a pill for 5 minutes and the way it was portrayed in the opening scenes made it both exciting and filled me with a longing to see some clever scenes using different people's abilities. Little did I know, I was to be let down. Other than Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, who uses his ability quite cleverly, anyone else who takes the pill lacks control and just causes carnage.Jamie Foxx's acting was probably the highlight of an overall dull film.

JGL and Jamie Fox are powerhouse actors, but the character development and chemistry was not there. It was not easy to remain interested and I found myself distracted throughout most of the movie. It was confusing at many times. The idea of 5 minutes of super human power sounds amazing, but all we got was a Hulk, a Johnny Storm, a Luke Cage and a couple of other forgettable meta humans. Code 8 had a more original concept. I do hope JGL and Jamie Fox do team up again for a different flick, that would be very cool.

It could have been an X-Men meets limitless kind of journey, but way more gritty. The concept was all theirs to play with but the movie makers didn't seem to want to get deep into it. They seemed to want to make a woke movie about social class distinction instead, most of the script is devoted to feebly touching upon systemic racism or oppression at a very surface level. In fact the depiction of that is only at a surface level too. Those are all great things to talk about at length when the genre is a social drama. In an action movie where people can turn into ice and fire... Not so much the right place or right time. Too much screen time goes by in non urgencies. Action movies that are successes usually use 95% of their time focusing on the plot at hand and action. After which there can be an underlying layer of social critique and education, or certain character/s could have a background that highlights those issues.
