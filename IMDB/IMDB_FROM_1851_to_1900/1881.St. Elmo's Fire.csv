0,bkoganbing,Life And Love In The Eighties,7,7 January 2010,"Someone has called this the ultimate Brat Pack movie and while I gladly will accept all nominations for rivals, this will do until someone suggests a better one.St. Elmo's Fire centers on the lives and loves of seven 20 something college graduates from the Georgetown, Maryland suburb of Washington, DC. They're all starting out with careers of some kind, but they're also looking for THE career move and the move to a real life partner.They run quite a gamut from Judd Nelson an aide to a Congressman to Rob Lowe who bounces from job to job and who really just wants to play his saxophone. The women are an assorted lot as well from hedonistic Demi Moore to virginal Mare Winningham with Ally Sheedy in the middle.We can't forget Emilio Estevez as the law student who works at St. Elmo's bar where they all hang out and Andrew McCarthy the cynical writer who's about to become a victim of what he doesn't believe in, committed love. Except for Winningham, they seem to have all hooked up with each other at one time or other and she's saving herself for the irresponsible Lowe. When you see the stiff her rich parents, Martin Balsam and Joyce Van Patten, are trying to set her up with, you can't really blame her.There's no real plot to St. Elmo's Fire, but the film is a character study of the young folk of the Eighties, at least the young white folk of the Eighties. It might have been nice to have included a minority or two in the cast. Still the characters do have a certain charm and you do care about what's to become of them. Best performances in the film are Rob Lowe for the men and Demi Moore for the women. They also have the showiest roles.As sociological study of the young urban professional of the time, you can't beat St. Elmo's Fire. Not bad in the entertainment department either.",St. Elmo's Fire
1,SnoopyStyle,Soapy cheesy melodrama,6,29 July 2014,"Seven friends are just out of college. Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe) is sax playing hard partying irresponsible mess with a baby. Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham) is a social worker from a wealthy family in love with Billy who keeps covering for him. Kirby Keger (Emilio Estevez) is studying the law and chasing older doctor Dale Biberman (Andie MacDowell). Alec Newbary (Judd Nelson) is a political animal living with girlfriend Leslie Hunter (Ally Sheedy). They're the perfect couple of the group. Kevin Dolenz (Andrew McCarthy) is a writer and never in a relationship which leaves some speculating that he's gay. Then there is Jules (Demi Moore) who lives vastly beyond her means. Everybody hangs out at a local hangout called St. Elmo's Bar.It's soapy. It's cheesy. It's a lot of white people problems. These are privileged self-obsessed characters trying to grow up. Certainly there is a lot of trash talked about of these actors. Besides the stigma of being called 'The Brat Pack', these are some of the best actors of their generation. The story is a jumble of melodrama. The preppy style is terribly dated but it remains a cultural milepost. Let's face it. A sweaty Rob Lowe playing the sax is cheesetastic.",St. Elmo's Fire
2,classicsoncall,"""I am now a student of life"".",6,2 January 2011,"Maybe it's my age showing, or my lack of a nostalgic sense of the Eighties, but this film only serves as a reminder of how much society has come to foster the entitlement mentality of the Me Generation. Granted, there are individuals in real life that resemble the characters here, but I believe I'm fortunate enough not to know any of them personally; and if faced with the opportunity I would have to respectfully decline. Self absorbed egotists like Billy (Rob Lowe) and Alec (Judd Nelson) are not the kind of guys I'd welcome as friends, and no matter how you spin Demi Moore's character, she's the kind of person that's eventually heading for a major downfall in life. The character I could almost relate to was Wendy (Mare Winningham), struggling to find her own way in friendships and career choice, but then she disrespected herself at the finale by granting Billy the favor of a going away present.The only positive spin I can put on this is that the players were capable enough as actors to give me such a negative reaction. Beyond that, I can only wonder why college graduates would willingly put themselves through this type of self induced trauma in the name of finding themselves. There are classier and more noble ways to do it than being complete jerks about it. On that score, this might be the picture that singularly resulted in it's players being nicknamed the Brat Pack.",St. Elmo's Fire
3,jboothmillard,St. Elmo's Fire,6,26 March 2011,"From director Joel Schumacher (Falling Down, Batman Forever, Phone Booth), I assumed this was one of the films from writer John Hughes, but I knew it was in the Brat Pack category, introducing an actor and actress or two that would go onto stardom. Basically seven friends: Alec Newbary (The Breakfast Club's Judd Nelson), Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe), Julianna 'Jules' Van Patten (Demi Moore), Kevin Dolenz (The Spiderwick Chronicles' Andrew McCarthy), Kirby Keger (The Breakfast Club's Emilio Estevez), Leslie Hunter (The Breakfast Club's Ally Sheedy) and Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham), were best friends and did pretty much everything together, all the way up to graduation. Now moved on from college, all are trying to work out and navigate where they are going into their adulthood. Alec aspires to a political profession, but changes his allegiance from Democrat to Republican, freaking out budding architect Leslie who he wants to marry, she is trying to make a name for herself and lives with him, but refuses marriage. Kirby is trying to become a lawyer, but finds work instead working in their local St. Elmo's Bar, and he is currently roommates with struggling writer Kevin. Kirby is trying to have a romance with slightly older female doctor Dale Biberman (Four Weddings and a Funeral's Andie MacDowell), and Kevin claims he doesn't date because he doesn't believe in love, everyone therefore thinks he is a closet homosexual that fancies Alec. Billy is the irresponsible one who is married with a child, but spends most of the time sleeping around and playing the saxophone on stage at the bar, and still living like a teenager with no responsibilities. Wendy is sheltered and still a virgin, she may come from a wealthy family who give her some financial support but has a lowly job working for social services, she is in love with Billy who is taking advantage of her. Everyone is concerned about Jules who works in a bank and doesn't have a job to afford the glamorous lifestyle she puts on, near the end she seemingly even tries to kill herself in a really slow way. In the end they are all reunited by a twist of fate, and even though Billy leaves for a better life or whatever, they stick together, outside the St. Elmo's Bar. Also starring Psycho's Martin Balsam as Mr. Beamish and Joyce Van Patten as Mrs. Beamish. It is interesting to look back now and see the stars that came from this, Lowe who went on to Austin Powers and The West Wing, Moore who went on to Ghost, A Few Good Men and, ahem, Striptease, and Sheedy who went on to, um, Short Circuit, and those who couldn't escape the teen movie. The cast are all good in their own ways, you could argue that there aren't story lines as such, but with themes like young love, young marriage, drug use and hidden sexuality, it doesn't matter much, it is nearly like the quality of The Breakfast Club, so a reasonable teen drama (comedy in part). Good!",St. Elmo's Fire
4,Tweekums,The quintessential Brat Pack movie,8,18 May 2014,"This is the story of seven friends; they were inseparable at college but will they be able to stay friends now they have graduated? In the opening scene we see that not all of them are keen to grow up; Billy has crashed a car while drunk injuring Wendy and while the group are checking up on her Kirby sees the girl he once went on one date with and becomes obsessed with her. The rest of the group have their problems too; Jules has a cocaine habit, Alec's and Leslie's 'perfect' relationship is about to fall apart and everybody thinks Kevin is gay. Over the course of the film we get to know the characters as their relationships begin to change and they come to terms with the fact that nothing lasts forever.'St. Elmo's Fire' is the quintessential Brat Pack movie; a young good looking cast of characters coming to terms with their different lives. The cast does a fine job making the story believable despite its slight resemblance to a soap opera with the various relationships and wondering who will end up with whom. Surprisingly the characters, with the exception of Wendy and possibly Leslie, all behave in a way that could be seen as cruel to others; this may be realistic but is unusual for characters we are meant to be sympathetic to. It is definitely an 'eighties' film; in style, in dress sense and in the music but it doesn't feel dated. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fans of the various Brat Pack members who appear in it or those who like eighties films in general.",St. Elmo's Fire
5,moonspinner55,Get these kids another round of drinks!,3,29 June 2001,"The youthful group in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet co-writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation. With a now-outdated cast of ""up and comers"", a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of ""Terms Of Endearment"", and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us, ""Fire"" is a paltry blaze, one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on. *1/2 from ****",St. Elmo's Fire
6,michaelRokeefe,We are graduates...what do we do know?,4,15 March 2003,"Joel Schumaker directs the script he co-wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations. The story line is a scrambled mess, but some scenes are actually good. There is a lot of wasted talent and time here. The cast is more impressive than the movie. Featured are Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham. The most notable being McCarthy and Moore. Lowe is quite obnoxious. Coming of age is not so damn easy.",St. Elmo's Fire
7,sunwarrior13,All Style Brat Pack Film,6,7 December 2014,"St. Elmo's Fire is a coming-of-age film that features the group known as ""The Brat Pack"" namely Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Mare Winningham.The story centers on a group of friends who just graduated from Georgetown University and their adjustment to post- university lives and the responsibilities that they are about to face soon when they get their first full-time employment after college.The characters involved are: Alex and Leslie who live together in a precarious relationship; Kevin looks bored writing obituaries for the newspaper; rich girl Wendy shares a doomed relationship with Billy; law student Kirby tries to pursue Leslie, an older flame from college; and party-girl Jules is promiscuous,snorts coke and drinks too much.While it may be a very popular film back in the 80's due to its prominence as a Brat Pack film genre,it was basically a melodrama that contains all style and no substance whatsover.It mainly relies on the presence of the group and nothing more.It was just a film made to assemble a group of beautiful people by 80's standards and make a film out of the said collection.",St. Elmo's Fire

9,hitchcockthelegend,"You break my heart. Then again, you break everyone's heart.",6,23 August 2009,"Directed by Joel Schumacher and starring some of the notables from the 1980s Brat Pack, St. Elmo's Fire asks the question of what do a group of tight knit pals do now that they have graduated from college? Choosing not to use what made the the best of John Hughes' {who is wrongly associated with this film} films work, ie: winning comedy in amongst the drama, Schumacher attempts to move on from teenager angst to the worry of looming adulthood, but without the comedy execution. Trouble is, is that it, and its cast, is never able to fully break away from the teen angst feel that enshrouds the characters. Adult angst exists, but it comes off as a dilution of similar films of its ilk. The writing is fine enough within its intentions, home truths about love, careers, marriage and various off shoots of adulthood trauma. All get nice little plot strands from which to uncoil themselves. But with some bad cheese acting from the likes of Rob Lowe and Emilio Estevez, and that nagging itch that these guys are so unlikeable. St. Elmo's Fire is ultimately an interesting, and honest enough 80s picture that ultimately never fully realises its potential. 5.5/10",St. Elmo's Fire
10,preppy-3,A Brat Pack masterpiece! Yup--it's that bad.,6,25 October 2005,"A bunch of self-absorbed, obnoxious idiots graduate from college in 1985 and go out into the real world...but they all have serious issues. Emilio Estevez is (inexplicibly) head over heels in love with dull Andie MacDowell--who can't stand him. Rob Lowe is married, has a kid and can't stop sleeping around. Judd Nelson loves Ally Sheedy but HE sleeps around driving her into Andrew McCarthy's arms. Demi Moore is hooked on drugs. Mare Winningham is the ""good girl"" who is madly in love with Lowe.I graduated from college in 1985 myself. I'll tell you--NOBODY in my graduating class were as shallow and stupid as these people are. The film looks great--it was professionally made to appeal to mainstream audiences (the R rating is for language only). All the actors look great and the movie zips along quickly...but not quick enough to disguise the fact that these people don't even remotely act like human beings, are immature (the guys especially) and are whiny and self-centered. Yet all their problems are neatly resolved at the movie's end. The problem is I didn't give a damn about any of these characters and a few I just wanted to slap (Nelsons' character especially).I'd be lying if I said I didn't somewhat enjoy it--but in a turn off your mind kind of way. As a light, shallow entertainment this is successful. As a deep or meaningful movie it fails. The only part that was realistic was a little speech Lowe makes to Winingham about how tough it was to go from college to real life. Otherwise it has about as much depth as a Hallmark card. I give it a 6 mostly because the cast isn't bad in their roles.",St. Elmo's Fire
11,zardoz-13,Day of the Yuppies,8,6 May 2014,"Seven friends graduate from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and then plunge helter skelter into the real world looking for true love, genuine happiness, and career success. The ensemble cast is to die for. Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Mare Winningham, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Demi Moore constitute a group protagonist. Naturally, since this is a Joel Schumacher soap opera, you can expect each character to chart a trajectory that alters who they are and whom they end up with at fade-out. Each struggles through various trials and tribulations, whether it is drug addiction, philandering, entering law school, or falling in love despite believing that love sucks. Schumacher took lenser Stephen H. Burum's advice and shot the film in widescreen so the group appeared in continuous shots to emphasize their camaraderie. Happily, nobody dies, winds up tragically crippled, so surprisingly enough, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" doesn't qualify as a standard issue tearjerker. According to Schumacher, he ""wanted to make movies for young people that were made in an A way as far as the quality of the people on the other side of the camera. They weren't made in an exploitation way."" This group of twentysomething guys and girls are upper-middle-class, but they embody everything we have come to know as yuppie. For the record, the dictionary definition of the term 'St. Elmo's Fire' is ""a flaming phenomenon sometimes seen in stormy weather at prominent points on a ship or airplane."" Demi Moore and Rob Lowe emerge as the most dysfunctional member of the group. As Jules, Moore plays the most reckless character. She snorts coke, scatters money as if it were confetti, and lives in an outlandish pink apartment. What she has no way of knowing is that disaster lurks around the corner for her. Ultimately, when everybody in her group is growing apart, Jules draws them back together through her own anguish. Andrew McCarthy is budding writer Kevin Dolenz; he bides his time impatiently at a newspaper where he toils as an obituary writer. Daughter of a conservative family, Wendy Beamish (Mare Winningham of ""Tombstone"") possesses the least confidence, and she wears too many clothes to conceal her chubbiness. She lusts after sax musician Billy Hicks (Rob Lowe of ""Youngblood"") who sports an earring. Hicks is almost as distressed as Jules. At the outset, everybody rushes to the hospital because Billy has crashed a car with Wendy as his passenger. Life is indeed complicated for Billy who estranged himself from his life and child. Alec (Judd Nelson of ""The Breakfast Club"") loves Ally Sheedy, but he pursues women. Conversely, Kevin loves Leslie from afar, but she doesn't realize the depth of Kevin's feelings. Eventually, they discover each other in a bout of sweaty sex that alienates Alec. Meanwhile, Kirby (Emilio Estevez of ""Young Guns"") struggles to impress a doctor, Dale Biberman, (North Carolina native Andie MacDowell of ""Greystoke"") who keeps standing him up. Alec shares an apartment with Leslie, but he has more fun playing the field with other women.Schumacher mentions on the ""St. Elmo's Fire"" commentary track that a New York magazine journalist wrote a story in a derogatory vein about the young stars and labeled them 'the Brat Pack.' Co-writer & director Joel Schumacher shows these kids navigating the rapids of modern-day life. The dialogue rippled with interesting lines. The kids hang out at bars, live together, and have the time of their lives. ""St. Elmo's Fire"" was lensed at the University of Maryland instead of Georgetown. A sense of beautifully realized irony permeates ""St. Elmo's Fire"" and makes it a memorable experience. Composer David Foster heightens the experience with an orchestral score that helped cement the public's affection for Schumacher's film.",St. Elmo's Fire
12,grantss,"Okay, but not very engaging nor profound",6,19 December 2016,"Seven friends have just finished university and are starting out in their careers. They are having to come to terms with careers, having to be more responsible, to fend for themselves and with all the decisions and issues life throws at them. Some are coping better than others and some aren't coping at all.The central plot alone should make this an interesting movie. The whole student-to-responsible adult transition genre is always a sure hit with people going through that phase and people wanting to relive that phase. However, St. Elmo's Fire doesn't examine this very well - quite dull at times and quite superficial.This isn't helped by the characters. Most of them are quite stereotypical and aren't that likable or are, at best, dull. Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham's characters would be the exceptions but even they are hardly people you can really get behind. On the upside, some of the sub-plots are reasonably interesting and the chemistry between the main stars is good. There is a decent feeling of camaraderie, which helps the nostalgia vibe the movie was setting out to achieve.The casting helps too. This was the movie that coined the term ""The Brat Pack"", referring to the host of young up-and-coming actors and actresses that were taking Hollywood by storm. Many of them had worked together in The Breakfast Club, helping the chemistry. Not that the performances are necessarily great, individually, but together they work well.Not great, but it'll do.",St. Elmo's Fire
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Well, you know, it ain't easy being me",6,30 May 2010,"Other than his Batman flicks, Schumacher is relatively dependable for delivering something that, at the very least, does the job. Watch A Time To Kill, 8MM, Bad Company, Phone Booth(OK, that one is arguably downright good), or The Number 23(the ones I've seen of his). Know what I mean? They sorta stay with you somewhat, but you don't find yourself calling them ""great"". This is another addition to that. I'll start by addressing complaints I've heard about this; it's said to be excessively 80's, and I basically get what they mean(not growing up in the decade, being 4 years old when it ended, I have no recollection of it), and if that is likely to bother you, then yeah(the man often does not know when to say stop to the designers; I refer you to his short stint at superhero movies... you know, the ones that nearly killed the genre, with the murder weapons being neon and camp), you may wish to steer clear. Another is that these characters, credible and well-written though they are, are spoiled, selfish, superficial, and at times empty-headed, brats. Yes. They are. The film is aware of this(which always makes it considerably easier to tolerate), and it doesn't pretend that those are attractive traits. No, they are not necessarily likable; however, they are relatively interesting to follow. Think Election. And the things they go through are quite easy to recognize. Life after high school, love vs. obsession, relationship issues and dealing with various problems that young people face are dealt with, and it comes across pretty convincing and genuine. It can be funny here and there, when it goes for it, a little of that being black comedy. This is fairly engaging, and there is some tension. There are a few stereotypes in this, such as the presentation of a gay man; meanwhile, when you look at how the straight people in this are, it would have stood out more(as Joel points out in the informative and amusing director's commentary on the DVD; it also comes with theatrical trailers for About Last Night and Mortal Thoughts) if it had been toned down. There's the prostitute and the Jews, as well, I suppose. The acting tends to be spot-on. There is a bit of sexuality(not graphic, only brief nudity) and strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone looking for pictures about the troubles of growing up. 6/10",St. Elmo's Fire
14,HotToastyRag,Time capsule of the '80s,6,28 July 2019,"If you grew up in the 1980s, you probably loved St. Elmo's Fire and all the other Brat Pack movies. You probably wore the outrageous hairstyles and fashions, and when you return to the anthem of your youth, you remember it fondly. If you grew up post-80s, you probably rented St. Elmo's Fire and said to yourself, ""There's no way people really dressed like that."" It just doesn't have the same feeling if you're renting it than if you lived it.With their feathered, back-combed, hair sprayed 'dos, pink and blue eyeshadow, hoop earrings, high-waisted jeans, muscle tanks, fishnet stockings, and clunky jewelry, a group of post-graduate kids adjust to the very difficult task of real life, given a new word by today's generation: ""adulting"". The more things change, the more they stay the same, and kids in the '80s found it just as difficult to grow up as millennials do now. What happens when a group of partiers try to hold down jobs, fall in and out of love with each other, still maintain their youthful fun, and try as hard as they can not to turn into their square parents? You get a classic Brat Pack movie. Rent this movie to see Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Mare Winningham, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, and Judd Nelson prance around in their '80s finest. You'll also get to see Martin Balsam, Joyce Van Patten, and Andie MacDowell in the first movie she was allowed to speak in her own, charming Southern voice.",St. Elmo's Fire

16,Mr-Fusion,The antithesis of 'The Breakfast Club' and anything worthwhile the '80s had to offer,2,14 March 2011,"""St. Elmo's Fire"" is another in a long line of movies with a Top 40 tie-in, and I'll take the John Parr song over the movie any day of the week. This is the film that effectively launched The Brat Pack to national stardom (in tandem with 'The Breakfast Club', but in all fairness, that one was at least a halfway decent movie). Named after the group's favorite college town watering hole, 'St. Elmo's Fire' gives us a soapy, melodramatic glimpse into the lives of 7 freshly graduated college students and their trials and tribulations as they face adult life. Robe Lowe is your typical party animal who's afraid to admit he's someone's father. Judd Nelson wants Ally Sheedy to marry him already (so he can stop cheating on her ...... the hell-?), but Sheedy's freaked because Nelson's just turned Republican. Mare Winningham's the sheltered rich girl (let's not forget she's still a pure virgin) who just wants Rob Lowe. Emilio Estevez is madly in love with a doctor (Andie MacDowell) and would do anything (including stalking) to tap that. Andrew McCarthy is in love with Ally Sheedy, but she's in love with a lascivious prick. Then there's Demi Moore who prostitutes herself to her boss (to solve those pesky credit problems) and lives from day to day just to get some more of that great coke.What masquerades as a complex story about troubled twenty-somethings is nothing more than a vapid showcase of self-important children; an array of some of the most unlikable characters I've ever seen.

17,JamesHitchcock,Quintessential Brat Pack,7,14 February 2021,"St. Elmo's fire is a weather phenomenon in which luminous plasma is created by a corona discharge from a sharp or pointed object in a strong electric field in the atmosphere such as those generated by thunderstorms. Somebody evidently also thought it would be a good title for a Brat Pack movie, although I'm not sure why. A rather convoluted explanation of the title, too convoluted to set out here, is given in the film itself.The Brat Pack was the name given to a group of young American actors in the eighties who were not only friends and socialised together but often appeared together in movies. ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is often regarded as one of the two quintessential Brat Pack films, the other being ""The Breakfast Club"", also from 1985. Both are coming-of-age films starring an ensemble cast, a popular genre at this period, ""Diner"" being another well-known example. ""The Big Chill"" deals with similar themes but with rather older characters, in their thirties rather than twenties, as does the British ""Peter's Friends"" from the early nineties.The traditional coming-of-age film tended to concentrate on adolescence and the teenage years, but for many young people their twenties, when they have completed their education, are setting out on their careers and are starting to think about serious romantic relationships, can be a time of even greater changes than their days in secondary school. ""St Elmo's Fire"" centres on a group of recent graduates from Georgetown University, Washington and the challenges they face in life after college.The story features several plotlines and there is insufficient space to deal with them all here. As in ""Diner"", some of the characters are keen to embrace new responsibilities while others want to hang on to their youthful freedoms for as long as possible. The most irresponsible of the group is Billy, unhappily married with a child, who is reluctant to hold down a job, preferring to hang around in bars, play the saxophone and pursue women. Aspiring politician Alec wants to marry his girlfriend Leslie, but she feels that they are both not ready to make such a commitment. (She is right about Alec, who has been cheating on her). Alec was a Democrat at college but has switched to the Republicans for careerist reasons, something which probably seemed like a good idea in 1985, the year after Reagan carried 49 out of 50 states in the Presidential election. (The abandonment of youthful political idealism was also an important theme in ""The Big Chill"").Alec's friend Kevin is secretly in love with Leslie. Kirby has become infatuated with a girl named Dale, even though he does not know her well and she already has a boyfriend. Wendy, the idealistic daughter of a wealthy family, has taken a job as a social worker, rather to her parents' displeasure. The much more materialistic Jules is working in banking but faces a crisis when she loses her job.With such a large cast it would be difficult to single out all the deserving contributions, but the ones which most stood out for me came from Rob Lowe as Billy, Judd Nelson as the cynical Billy and Mare (it's short for Mary) Winningham as the innocent Wendy. (Like Andie MacDowell who also appears here, Winningham was not normally regarded as one of the Brat Pack). None of the performances, however, are bad, which rather gives the lie to the theory, a popular one at the time, that the Brat Packers lacked any real talent apart from a talent for partying hard and for getting themselves written about in the gossip columns.The danger with trying to combine so many storylines together is that the film will end up confusing and difficult to follow, but director Joel Schumacher handles his material well and the danger is largely averted, as it is in ""The Big Chill"" and ""Diner"". In some ways ""St Elmo's Fire"" is very much a product of its time, the materialistic, go-getting yuppie years of the eighties, the period which gave us the phrase ""greed is good"". (That phrase could serve as the personal motto of some of the characters, especially Alec and Jules). In other ways, however, it also deals with perennial themes like love, friendship and idealism, and has something interesting to say about them. 7/10A goof. Contrary to what Billy informs us in the film, there was indeed a St Elmo, better known in English as St Erasmus of Formia but in Italian as Santo Elmo. He is the patron saint of sailors.",St. Elmo's Fire
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,A precious 80's time capsule,7,6 December 2007,"I just bought a DVD with About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire both on it, for five dollars, I figured they might be worth a look. I watched St. Elmo's fire last night and I have to say that I was very impressed. Like About Last Night, this is still a very important story to this day. I have to say that both these films got to me very much because I have had to deal with the exact same situation, a relationship that had to find more than the physical attraction and now that I'm 22, dealing with an adult life. St. Elmo's Fire deals with the scary and nerve wrecking times transcending from the college life style to young adulthood. Going into a career and possible family is a lot harder than it looks, and that's what our brat pack friends have to deal with.A group of friends who have just graduated college are now facing the real world of discovering who they are. We have a couple who are in a relationship where the man wants to get married but is fooling around and the girl doesn't want to marry him. We have a girl, Jules, who is having financial troubles and is using her looks to get what she wants. We have a man, Kirby, who is obsessed with a love from childhood. Another guy, Billy, who can't grow up despite him having a child and wife. A girl, Wendy, who is learning not to rely on her father's money and is still going through the awkward faze of her looks. And last but not least, Kevin, who is in love with his best friend's girlfriend and is also a writer.St. Elmo's Fire is a good film and I know that this was one of Joel Schumacher's first films, he did a decent job I think. It's in some ways an important film of today and also is a classic in it's own right. It's one of the major brat pack films and also brought together a great story that everyone could relate too in some way. Despite how dated it is, it's a timeless story of the fears that we face having to grow up. Not too many people pay attention to this hard time in a young adult's life, so St. Elmo's Fire is a great way of taking a look at the situation.

Well for one there's part-time waiter, at St. Elmo's, and full time complainer about the state of world, or his, affairs Kirby Keger, Emilio Estevez. Kirby has been lusting after pretty and refined Dale Biberman, Andi MacDowell, ever since he laid eyes on her-when he was a junior and Dale a senior- back at Georgetown University but never had the nerve to ask her, in Dale being a bit older then him, out for a date. Now meeting Dale, a registered nurse, in the local hospital emergency ward where she works Kirby is ready willing and able to light Dale's fire only to find out that she's shacked up with a ski bum in the country!There's also Billy Hicks, Rob Lowe, who we at first see in the emergency ward after his crashed his car putting the passengers he had in it on life-support. Faced with a DWI charge, where if convicted he'll never qualify to be a D.C policeman, Billy is also estranged from his young wife Felica, Jenny Wright, and infant daughter Melody because of his many extra martial affairs. We can't overlook the shy and sensitive Kevin, Andrew McCarthy, Dolenz Kirby's room-mate who's both a frustrated writer as well as heart broken in that the girl of his dreams Leslie, Ally Sheedy, is set to marry his friend, and other ""Brat Pack"" member, political consultant, for both Democrat and Republican politicians, Alec Newbary, Judd Nelson. As things turn out Alec the most craziest and mixed up of the bunch is soon, in his uncontrollable paranoia, to become the most obnoxious and self-destructive member of the entire ""Brat Pack"" crew!***SPOILERS***We must never forget the swinging and self-confident Jules, Dimi Moore, who was the hottest number on, and now that she graduated, as well as off the collage campus. As we and her friends soon find out Jules' hot and heavy affair with her boss is nothing but a load of horse-sh*t on her part. In fact Jules had been canned from her job, for poor attendance, almost a month ago and is now hooked on coke that she mooches money off from her friends, as well as puts out for, to pay for the sh*t.Finally we come to the only normal member of the group the sweet and caring Wendy Beamish, Mare Winningham,who comes from a both good and financially well off, in the greeting card business, family. Wendy works at the local social service office helping those who are both down and out and forgotten by the public at large. Being set up to marry the nerdy Howie Krantz, Jan Cutler, Wendy revolts against her parents and soon get it on with the womanizing and drug addicted, as well as wife cheating, Billy Hicks. Ending up losing her virginity to Billy who ends up leaving town for NYC, to be an Hard Rock East Village Band's new pot smoking saxophone player, Wendy can only hope that she's finally got the hang of it in what the ""Me and only Me"" Generation, in 1980's America, is really all about. And at the same time do everything possible to try to avoid and not become a part of it!",St. Elmo's Fire
20,lesleyharris30,"Neither Funny nor Dramatic Enough to Amaze,",6,31 March 2017,"St. Elmo's Fire is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a stellar cast. We really get to see some of the most famous Brat Pack actors shine in this film, one of the more serious in their series of 80s teen movies, with the likes of Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy really giving it all in their roles, delivering complicated characters who have a lot going on after graduating college. However, it is underwhelming as a film. It is not light hearted enough to make you smile, nor is it dramatic enough to have you at the edge of your seat. The dialogue is quite bland and it feels like Joel Schumacher was really going through the motions during filming. As well as that, the characters are very unlikeable. It does not portray either sides as villains, letting us as audiences decide who we support in the conflict in different plots, but I did not sympathise with any of them. I found every character to be in the wrong, all proving to be disloyal, selfish people, insincere human beings. You finish this movie unsure whether it was genuinely trying to make you feel. Do not let the cast fool you, it is not another Breakfast Club, as a matter of fact, St Elmos Fire is somewhat of a layered mess, better off giving this one a miss. A group of college graduates struggle with adulthood and new found responsibilities. Best Performance: Rob Lowe / Worst Performance: Demi Moore",St. Elmo's Fire

All the characters are wonderful, and it also has some very powerful scenes as well, plus Emilio Estevez,Rob Lowe,Andrew McCarthy,Demi Moore,Judd Nelson,Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham are all simply amazing in this!. I felt for all of the characters and what they were going through, but out of the most I felt for was Rob Lowe, and this is extremely well made and written as well, plus I loved the dialog too. The ending was also very well done, as I couldn't have been happier with it, and while they were all very immature they were still quite likable, plus I loved the soundtrack as well. I was kind of shocked when Estevez gave Andie MacDowell a big long returning kiss, as it was too immature for my tastes but I still got a chuckle out of it, plus this should be a lot higher then 5.8. It's also very funny at times, and it's also quite emotional too, plus I believe this is one of the best young cast's ever!. This is an extremely underrated film, that's nearly a classic in my opinion, with an engrossing story and brilliant performances from all, and I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is excellent!. Joel Schumacher does an excellent! job here with fantastic camera work, solid angles and just keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is brilliant!. Emilio Estevez is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is very immature but also very likable, so I felt for him, he had good chemistry with all of the cast, cracked me up, and gives one of his finest performances!. Rob Lowe is also amazing here, he is the character that I felt the most for, since he had a wife a kid, no money and everything going wrong for him, so at the end I hoped he would get his life back on track, he really did an amazing job!. Andrew McCarthy is also amazing here I felt bad for him, that everybody thought he was gay, he had a likable character, and I was rooting for him to get Ally Sheedy(Leslie), he was just awesome!. Demi Moore is also amazing here, she had a messed up character but I still felt sorry for her because she had a drug and alcohol problem, she also had a good sense of humor!. Judd Nelson is amazing here as well, he was kind of selfish, but still likable, and I felt for him too, It's too bad this guy never became a big star because he had so much potential. Ally Sheedy is amazing in her role she had good chemistry with Nelson, and was very likable, I really dug her. Mare Winningham is a Cutie, and is amazing in her role too as the virgin, I wanted her to be with Lowe at the end, but I was happy with the way things turned out with her character!. Andie MacDowell is gorgeous and did fine with what she had to do, as Emilio's love interest. Martin Balsam does good in his short role as the Father. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5",St. Elmo's Fire
22,slightlymad22,Rob Lowe & Demi Moore Shine,6,22 October 2014,"One of the main ""Brat Pack"" movies is ""St Elmo's Fire"". directed by Joel Schumacher. The film, starring Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, and Mare Winningham. Plot In A Paragraph: The movie centres on a group of friends that have just graduated from Georgetown University and their adjustment to their post-university lives and the responsibilities of encroaching adulthood.Judd Nelson is amazingly unlikeable as Alec, and it's painfully embarrassing watching Emilio Estevez chase after Andie McDowell. Ally Sheedy is OK, as is Andrew McCarthy as Kevin. But for me the stars of the movie is Rob Lowe and Demi Moore. Both are superb in roles that don't exactly have you rooting for them.",St. Elmo's Fire
23,zkonedog,Deep Ideas Swallowed Up In Melodrama,5,10 November 2020,"The same year--1985--that this film was released, ""The Breakfast Club"" (featuring much of the same cast) did a deep-dive on high school life and personalities. In ""St. Elmo's Fire"", the lens is turned a bit further out, instead toward the immediate post-college experience. While indeed digging out some interesting material, most of it here is swallowed up in the coupling melodrama.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on seven college acquaintances who are all struggling with something after their college graduation:-Alec (Judd Nelson) and Leslie (Ally Sheedy) are living together and trying to ""adult"", rather unsuccessfully.
-Billy (Rob Lowe) is mentally stuck back at the frat house.
-Kirby (Emilio Estevez) develops an unhealthy obsession with a former college fling.
-Jules (Demi Moore) is maxed out on credit, Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) can't get anyone to notice his writing, and Wendy (Mare Winningham) is struggling with her family's expectations versus the life she wants for herself.In terms of overall themes, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" does a pretty good job of cultivating some interesting ones. Each of the main characters definitely has some sort of battle, and that struggle is one that largely can be related to even 35 years later. In other words, the writers and director Joel Schumacher do a decent job of creating an interesting character environment.The major problem here? Much of that ""interesting stuff"" is lost in a muddle of melodrama, most often centered upon couplings within the seven leads. At times, things can feel a bit soap opera-ish and lose focus from the real meaty material. I would have preferred each character to be able to investigate their own internal demons/strengths rather than base such revelations on romantic flings or ""who's sleeping with who"" type scenarios.Fortunately, the cast here is so great that even when not everything is working, it can still be fun to watch. Nearly everyone in this film went on to stardom of at least some level. They all turn in great performances and have solid chemistry amongst themselves. From what people consider the 80s ""Brat Pack"", ""St. Elmo's Fire"" contains the most cast members.Overall, I can't say I was enormously pleased nor tremendously let down by this movie. It is good enough to be entertaining and mostly thoughtful, yet not nearly (and this is clear pretty much right from the get-go) in the intellectual league of the aforementioned ""Breakfast Club"", for example. Worth watching if a fan of the era/actors, but otherwise one that can be skipped and not rued later.",St. Elmo's Fire
24,southdavid,Tickle me Elmo,4,8 September 2020,"I've been listening to Rob Lowe's podcast and he recently had Demi Moore on, in which they reminisced about ""St Elmo's Fire"" a little - which is a film that I've not seen in a few years, so decided to try again. Time has, alas, not been kind.A group of friends, played by Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Andrew McCarthy, Mare Winningham and Judd Nelson, graduate from college and try to make their first steps into their adult lives. Without the support network and structure for the first time, they struggle to find work, enthusiasm, love, stability and sobriety - all whilst repeated returning to their old college bar, named St Elmo's Fire.Of its time, if very much a way of describing ""St Elmo's Fire"". A time when you fell into job after job after leaving college, where parents could afford endless indulgences for their children, where you could play saxophone in a band without getting bottled off after two minutes. By drawing on real experiences, Joel Schumacher is able to produce a film more authentic than the ones of John Hughes for example, but that really comes at the cost of story. It's essentially a selection of things that happen, none of the characters really learn anything, or suffer any genuine consequences and then it ends. There's amusing aspects within that, moments of dialogue - but largely my main come away was - that was a waste of time.There are also a few aspects that would be considered problematic now, from three of the four male leads. Judd Nelson's character cheats on his girlfriend relentlessly, Lowe's tries to pressurise Moores into having sex with him and then ""gifts"" himself to Winningham and takes her virginity. Estevez is, there's no other word for it, a stalker. Forcing himself into Andie McDowell's life and then getting mad when she doesn't show up to a party he's organised. Why she repeated rewards that behaviour is frankly baffling.In fairness, I didn't hate the film whilst I was watching it, there is, as I say, some humour both intentional and unintentional, stuff occasionally threatens to happen - there's just a disappointment when it ends that it never amounted to anything.",St. Elmo's Fire
25,jadavix,Great acting in a dull movie,5,16 February 2019,"""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of those movies that feels like a warm up tape for the actors involved. It is very well acted, but the movie has no story threads that connect, or characters that really come through. So it just feels like you're watching the actors do exercises.It is notable for, if nothing else, being the ""Brat Pack"" movie with the most Brat Pack members in it. There are five of the eight Brat Pack members in the movie, but it is far from the best movie these once hip actors appeared in, and perhaps one of the least interesting.There are so many actors you recognize in it, but not one memorable character. Rob Lowe is a bad boy who plays the saxophone unrealistically, Mare Willingham is a virgin who doesn't seem attractive enough to warrant his interest, Andrew McCarthy is a guy people think might be gay, but we don't know if he really is or not, and Demi Moore is a stuck up snob who does cocaine.There's also (of course) Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Andie McDowell and probably a bunch of others I'm forgetting, but none of their characters make any impression whatsoever.Is this the fault of Schumacher? He's known as a generally bad director, mostly for killing the Batman character on screen. But he's not THAT bad - check out ""Falling Down"" if you don't believe me. Perhaps it's the screenplay. There are no strong narrative threads in the movie. I think the reaction at the time was mostly that these are shallow, irritating, uninteresting characters, and the movie doesn't give you any reason to care about them. It's not a Todd Solondz or Neil LaBute kind of thing where you're not SUPPOSED to like them, and that's the point. I think you're supposed to like them in spite of their flaws.And you don't.",St. Elmo's Fire
26,ebiros2,Dreams of College Graduates of the '80s,7,26 December 2012,"It seems like most of the male Brat Packs are in this movie. This was the first movie that I took notice of Demi Moore. She became very popular after this this movie was released.Brat Pack was starting to grow up and grow out of their teenager roles, and in this movie they all look convincing as a college graduates.'80s were the times when young adults or yuppies as they were referred to had the chance to dream about the fantastic future they had before them. This movie has this atmosphere in spades. None of the characters have a megalomaniacal dreams about their future. They just want to have quiet loving family life, which was unique to the '80s generation. This movie was like the microcosm of the feeling they had for their life.The goodness of this film is that it so captures this culture well. It's one of the quintessential '80s movie for this reason.",St. Elmo's Fire
27,jimbo-53-186511,Simply put it's just not very interesting,4,26 February 2021,"7 friends and college graduates find themselves having to traverse the tricky course from adolescene to adulthood. Each respective graduate has their own foibles and handle post-college life in their own unique manner with their respective journeys being scrutinized throughout the film...We've seen this type of thing time and time again, but a familiar concept is fine as long as it is executed well, but suffice to say St Elmo's Fire seems to find itself never quite firing on all cylinders....Apart from the oddity of seeing actors such as Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy and Emilio Estevez starring as high school students in Breakfast Club and post-college graduates in St Elmo's Fire (both of which were released in the same year) St Elmo's Fire never seems to get into gear (mainly due to most of the characters and their story arcs being a combination of unlikeable and uninteresting). Each character seem to have their own quirks/demons, but many are barely developed and as I've mentioned most are uninteresting. The only character's journey that is moderately interesting is Kirby's journey (a tale of infatuation and unrequited love which is arguably the most relatable character trait/storyline).Moving away from the characters, there seem to random gaps in the story that arrive without explanation; such as Billy having a row with Wendy in one scene then being married to another woman in the next scene; so what time period was there supposed to have been between these 2 scenes? Then later when Kirby goes off to find Dale he is informed by her roommate that she has gone skiing, but the scene then jumps to Kirby tracking Dale down to some winter wonderland Chalet - so where did he go? How far did he drive? Wherever St Elmo's Fire was set was free of snow so it's fair to assume that he has driven a fair distance. It's carelessness like this that sinks an already problematic film further into the ground so to speak.I suppose the actors do the best that they can, but in all honesty the majority of them are whiny brat-packers with relatively uninteresting story arcs and much like the Breakfast Club the cloying melodramatic finale just never really rang true. I've given it 4 out of 10 mainly because the film had some likeable characters and 1 mildly engaging story arc, but these things alone are not enough to save the film.",St. Elmo's Fire

30,slokes,Forever Gets A Lot Shorter,3,6 October 2014,"Back when I first saw this film in a cinema in 1985, I hated it for being so callow and smug. I can't say I feel that differently about its defects, but I don't hate ""St. Elmo's Fire"" anymore. It kind of captures the charm of the period even if it grasps annoyingly at times for laughs and pathos. Seven young people just graduated from Georgetown University find themselves up against various life challenges revolving around love. Political aide Alec (Judd Nelson) wants to marry his live-in girlfriend Leslie (Ally Sheedy), but she's not sure. Journalist Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) hides his secret love, while waiter Kirby (Emilio Estevez) and social worker Wendy (Mare Winningham) are pathetically unable to conceal theirs. Billy (Rob Lowe) is married with a baby but can't stay faithful, while Jules (Demi Moore) dances as fast as she can with her office affairs and cocaine habit.""It's our time on the edge,"" is how Billy puts it, but that edge seldom merits our interest. Unfortunately, director-writer Joel Schumacher's indulgent handling of his characters' various angsts creates a gulf for viewers like me. He likes them too much, I think, for them to be successful comic-tragic figures.Too many groaner lines in the script, too, the kind that seem crafted for trailer use rather than real human dialogue: ""Wasted love! God, I just wish I could get it back!"" ""I'm obsessed, thank you very much!"" ""Let's rock!"" ""You break my heart. Then again, you break everyone's heart!"" Catch-phrase overuse really gets out of hand.I won't say ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is so bad it's good, but it's certainly distinctive in a way that I think has improved it over the years. Much of it is in the way of camp value. But it also captures a period in time, and a group of young actors, at a point when pop culture was coming together around them. They became known as the Brat Pack, which made them seem even more insufferably popular than they already were. The ""Brat Pack"" moniker was something they didn't accept, and Schumacher whines about it on his DVD commentary, but it made them what they were and in this film anyway, they seem to live up to that image, with their toilet dunking and ritual chants.Another thing Schumacher mentions on his commentary is the dinging he got for the film's elitist tone. He makes the point that the critics mistook ""content for intent,"" but it's hard to miss the snooty ways the main characters look down on the poor unfortunates around them who aren't as cool as they are, whether it be a sad naked guy wandering a hospital corridor, a gay designer, or Wendy's schlubby suitor.""Welfare recipients are getting better looking,"" says Billy, which would be wrong in anyone's mouth but particularly so from the sculpted lips of Rob Lowe. It's the kind of line that screams for a comeuppance that never really comes.What works for the film is mainly visual. The wet streets, pastel shirts, neon ties, and Billy Idol wall mural all scream 1980s, but in a better way than they did then. The David Foster score still holds up, as do the two hit songs from the soundtrack. And the actors do work well together, playing against each other naturally and with considerable charm, even if Nelson does fume and McCarthy rub his eyes too much.It's a time capsule film, one that deserves to be in its time capsule most of the time. But it has moments of real entertainment, perhaps nostalgia, perhaps something deeper, a sense of life's passage experienced in a kind of contented bubble you know is about to pop.",St. Elmo's Fire
31,gcd70,Saved by the cast and a great soundtrack,5,12 August 2007,"From writer-director Joel Schumacher (co-written with Carl Kurlander), ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is sadly only an occasionally funny, relatively entertaining film about seven young friends trying to grow up in the big world. The script and direction are second rate, and if not for a very good soundtrack (that included the hits ""Man in Motion"" and ""Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire"") and an enjoyable cast who have fun making this movie, this one may have been a complete flop.There is nothing really impressive about this teen film (except that huge brat pack cast that included Rob, Emilio, Demi, Ally, Andrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson and Mare Winningham).Tuesday, November 12, 1991 - Video",St. Elmo's Fire
32,MarieGabrielle,Its not that bad...a comment on the times.....,8,27 May 2007,"A few comments here have slammed this movie for being shallow, despite decent performers. Maybe this is not 100% similar to real life. But it does have some parallels, and except for the Judd Neldon character (rather annoying) it is realistic and comedic in some aspects.Demi Moore as Jules is simply lost in denial borrowing money to keep up an image of success. They are 26 years old and have no clue what is in store. Andrew McCarthy likable and sympathetic. Ally Sheedy, just okay. Rob Lowe is very good as irresponsible Billy, involved with Mare Winningham, the resident unattractive 'old standby' girlfriend.There are some scenes reminiscent of a frat party. A few scenes with Emilio Estevez, pursuing a pipe-dream romance with Andie McDowell. Basically it addresses recent graduates floundering, attempting different careers and lifestyles, affairs and obsessions. It catches that time period most of us had, when we thought we were so significant in the world, not yet jaded, still trying to find meaning and hope. The Winningham character particularly conveys the aspect of the screenplay. When her father (Martin Balsam) tells her to just get married settle down and have a greeting card franchise (like the rest of her family) No I am committed to my real job, she says as she works as a social worker, still trying to have an affect.Similar to the later Generation X issues, and the now sense of alienation, everyone goes through similar growing pains, whether 80's materialism, 90's nihilism ('Reality Bites') or today's general alienation and violence. The issues are the same, the culture just manifests them a bit differently. 8/10",St. Elmo's Fire
33,Movie-ManDan,"Unlikeable In Most Respects, But Can't Deny The Good.",5,29 January 2021,"In what is possibly the worst of the Brat Pack films, ""St. Elmo's Fire"" has their biggest ensemble cast in an adolescent soap-opera brought to the big screen where these talented performers play with such conviction and energy. Problem is, there is nothing redeeming about the characters themselves. Lots of movies feature heavily flawed characters, but the good ones (such as Raging Bull) develop them very deeply and give them redemption. This does none of that.""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of the most 80s things around. Some may not like that, but I did. And as said earlier this is much like a soap opera. Most will hate that aspect, but I didn't mind. To me, the song made for the movie by John Parr is easily the best part of the movie. He had no idea how to write the lyrics, so he wrote about Rick Hansen and threw a few movie allusions here and there. Out came a great 80s pop-rock song.The movie follows a slew of close friends that just graduated from college. With adulthood calling and responsibilities arising, these friends seem unwilling to move on. They are immature and just want to have all the fun they can. Okay I can see wanting to go to parties and have fun, but these people are emotionally and mentally in arrested development.Kirby (Emilio Estevez) is a law school grad and works at the St. Elmo's bar as a waiter. He is desperate to fall in love with a doctor (Andie McDowell). Kirby met her only once and is going berserk to see her again. He doesn't even know her! He does all he can to get to her. Lots of this is embarrassing and we resent Kirby instantly.Billy (Rob Lowe) is the most immature boy of the group. He had a baby out of wedlock and it seems as though his only aspiration is to get drunk and party everyday.Alec (Judd Nelson) is the smartest and most mature of the group. That is until he cheats on his fiancée, Leslie (Ally Sheedy). He gets dumber as the movie goes on.Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) is a writer who's own story is the most forgettable. That's not a good thing. All I can remember is people thinking he is gay. That never develops.Julianne (Demi Moore) is a spoiled daddy's girl. She's the least likeable of the girls.Mare Winningham plays Wendy who is the most likeable of the friends, along with Ally Sheedy.Yes, most of these characters are despicable, but they are drawn out with such conviction and realism. That is both good and bad; it is good that a movie is made about seemingly real people, but because they seem like real people, but our hatred towards them is stronger.Could this movie have been worse? Of course. But it does not change the fact that this is clad with sucky people. The song and the power in the acting are why it is possible to watch until the very end without turning it off.2/4",St. Elmo's Fire
34,eric262003,A Life Lesson For All Post Graduates,8,22 March 2010,"Okay so now I've graduated from college, I finished writing all my exams, handed in my term papers and thesis' and gave my valedictory address to all the other graduates, who've done the same. But there are tons of questions that have remained unanswered. Like what am I going to do for the rest of my life? Where do go from here? What's in it for me in the real world? What to do with myself? Even though ""St. Elmo's Fire"" was released in 1985, the post graduate angst still exists to this day and still affects those people today as they pick up their degrees and venture out into the real world. St. Elmo's is the name of the bar where 7 Georgetown graduates hang out fleshing out what they plan to do for the rest of their lives. Though they've never spoken to each other in school, the graduates unite to discuss the matters.Alley Sheedy and Judd Nelson are a couple shacking up with each other, Nelson hopes to marry Sheedy so that he can finally give up his philandering ways. Andrew McCarthy is Nelson's buddy who is a hopeless romantic, and tries to openly admit he is attracted to Sheedy. Emilio Estevez plays a young law student who works as a waiter to pay off his tuition, and has a huge crush on a much older woman (Andie McDowall). Demi Moore is the high-spirited overly-dramatic party-fanatic who seems to be in an awkward relationship with her doomed-out husband (Rob Lowe). Mare Winningham is the social service specialist who's clueless in finding her true passion, one that is outside of the vicinity of her father's ambitions.Although the characters score high points in depth,the Washington D.C. setting is rich in setting and it comes to life in splendid perspective. Such events and sights that were symbolic to the city includes partying with Arab nobility. The scenes from D.C. including the St. Elmo's Bar that is still around to this day. If you're looking to be enlightened by the classic nostalgia of the 1980's while at the same time need a good inspiring tale of the trials and tribulations of post-graduate life and the life-altering decisions that all college students can relate to then, this movie is the right ingredient for self-exploring.",St. Elmo's Fire

Not only is it a film that has an incredible young cast in it, but it is a film that does a great job of dealing with a plethora of issues.  My favourite character was Billy, the Rob Lowe character.  Sometimes his intentions weren't always spelled out for us, but there are subleties about the way he plays his character that really hit home.  You can tell that he misses the easier days of college.  The days where all he had to do was play sports and smoke up a bit.  But now he is in real life and he can't quite seem to find his niche.  He is still the good looking playboy that can get laid whenever he feels like it, but as for dealing with real life issues, he is confused and scared.  And he masks that insecurity by being a playboy.  It's a great character study.  Many of the other characters in the film have interesting stories as well.  None of them have quite figured out what the meaning of life is yet and all of them are kind of living on the edge.  All are attempting to get by with what they have, but what it ultimately comes down to is that none of them really knows the answers. Maybe some have become more successful than others but deep down they are all scared of life.  Now I don't know about other mid 20's people, but I can sure relate to what they are feeling and going through. And this movie made me feel like I am not the only one that may not have all the answers.  If this is a film that you haven't seen in a few years, watch it.  Admire what it wants to say.  Take it for what it is.  I really enjoyed what this film was about.  And it made me feel a bit better about life, after all, we're all going through St. Elmo's Fire.",St. Elmo's Fire
37,jaredmobarak,The only illusion that's worth itSt. Elmo's Fire,8,8 April 2007,"I think Joel Schumacher gets a bad rap. Sure Batman & Robin is possibly the worst movie ever made, and it did kill a multi-million dollar franchise, but is that truly all we think about on the mention of his name? I myself will admit to keeping a stigma of hack whenever Schumacher is talked about, however, along with some decent films of late, his track record in the 80's was full of pure, nostalgic gems. I finally got the opportunity to check out one of my mother's favorite films, St. Elmo's Fire. Made at the height of Brat Pack fame, this film really gets the angst of college graduation and the life of responsibility and work that waits in the future right. While not as quotable or memorable as say The Breakfast Club, Schumacher still is able to take a moment in the youth of society and make something meaningful out of it. Maybe I can relate to it having just graduated from college two years ago, but I think that it would be relevant later on as well. Even if not, it is an accomplishment to last over twenty years and still be relatable to someone in that same position in the present day.So the film is chock full of stereotypes and clichés, does that make it not true? We have our striver for fame and notoriety at the expense of his ideals, the girlfriend who wants to make a career before settling down as a stay at home mother, the troubled artist who can't leave school behind for a real life, the self-obsessed flirt who would rather self-destruct than ruin the façade she has worked so hard to build, the love-struck indecisive one stalking a past love and changing himself to try and win her over, and the confused souls not quite sure what they want to do with their new independence. We have the drug use, the sleeping around, the comradery, and the heartbreak. Through it all, though, you can really buy into it and see moments in your own life that mirror the events on screen almost perfectly. I think a lot of this has to do with the times and the ability to use actors that are actually the age of the characters they are playing. This is a film about 23 year olds trying to find themselves, and the authenticity of having people that age, going through those things in their real lives, helps the performances to be truthful. Nowadays this would have been changed to a post- high school story with the 18 year olds played by actors 25 or older. It's the vulnerability and the childlike appearance that makes you buy into the story and want to follow it to the end to see if the friendships can remain intact.The star-filled cast does a great job throughout, and a film like this makes you wonder where these guys have gone. An actress like Ally Sheedy, who had the talent and the looks, pretty much fell off the map once the 80's came to a close. It is her and Andrew McCarthy that really carry the film. He is another that disappeared after Weekend at Bernie's. It is always nice to see this troupe of acting talent and what they were capable of in their prime. Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, and Judd Nelson are all pitch-perfect in their roles along with Mare Winningham playing the friend that is so totally different from everyone else in the group, yet believable because we all have a friend like that. The only weak spot, in my opinion, is Rob Lowe, who at many times seems a bit out of his element as the drunk, party guy cracking jokes and getting into trouble. I don't discount his performances totally, though, because when he has moments of clarity, like when he talks Moore down after her total collapse, he is really excellent.Everyone goes through a moment of time in his/her life like the characters on screen in St. Elmo's Fire. Schumacher should be given credit for giving us a poignant study into the lives of those souls on the cusp of a new chapter in life and the decisions that need to be made to continue forward without regrets for what is left behind. The dialogue is realistic and it all ends in a conclusion that makes sense in the scheme of the character's evolutions. Your friends will always be there for you, through thick and thin, however, as you grow older, the roles each play in your life changes. Getting older doesn't mean severing ties to the past, but instead a restructuring of it to keep you strong and moving towards the future.",St. Elmo's Fire
38,Mister-6,"You don't tickle me, ""Elmo""...",1,21 February 2000,"When this film originally came out, I thought it would be a good idea to go to the theatre to see it.I was wrong.  All it did was show me how many OTHER people with bad judgment lived in my home-town.""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of the most relentlessly narcissistic exercises in shallow self-involvement I have ever seen.  And seeing a bunch of kids playing grown-up didn't help matters much, either.Now, the cast here has done some great things and no doubt will again.  But here, all they do is look and act with the kind of smug assurance of a rich kid playing with big toys that you will never have, and smirking all the while.Every character here is jealous of one another, wants what they have, is never satisfied and makes half-hearted efforts to make the most of what they have.  But when what they have is shallow stupidity, that doesn't leave them much to work with.Estevez fares best as a love-sick dope who follows and tries to woo a pretty doctor (McDowell, the most radiant woman in the whole movie).  He actually tries to do something and act on his gut.  It works, and so does he.At least HE still gets pretty steady work.As for the others... well, let's just say that there's no sense in worrying about a sequel.One star, for the Estevez story-line.  Boola-boola-boola, yuk-yuk-yuk!",St. Elmo's Fire
39,TOMASBBloodhound,Still a relevant and entertaining film.,8,27 November 2005,"Some critics of this film could not swallow the premise. How could these people in their early twenties be suffering through so many problems? People usually wait until their 40's before going through a mid-life crisis, they argued. Well, let me just say that life immediately after college can be a struggle. My first year after it was pretty much a disaster, but most young people usually figure things out and hit their stride eventually. The characters we meet in St. Elmo's Fire have all kinds of problems to deal with, and it's fun to see the choices and mistakes they make.The cast is terrific, but there are so many main characters that we don't get to know all of them perhaps as well as we'd like to. We have Rob Lowe as a womanizer, dead-beat dad who cannot hold a job. Emilio Estevez only seems interested in winning over Andie MacDowell (who wouldn't be) and will take any job that he feels might impress her. Demi Moore is broke and spends too much time romancing her boss. She looks amazing in this film, as she does in so many others. Mare Winningham is a rich young Jewish gal who'd rather dish out meals to the homeless than go into her family's greeting card business. Ally Sheedy and Judd Nelson have an odd relationship. He screws around constantly on her but justifies his behavior since she refuses to marry him! Sheedy seems like the most normal character by far. Then there's Andrew McCarthy who plays the typically mousy character we've come to associate with him over the years. He's a sensitive writer who most people think is gay since he's never had a girlfriend. He's really been lusting after Sheedy all these years, and at one point in the film, he gets a shot at her.As you might imagine, with all those characters it's hard for the film to stay focused on any of them for very long. Many of their subplots don't always intersect, and even a trip to the bathroom could cause you to miss out on a key plot development or two. Perhaps Joel Schumacher's frenetic pace was not right for the film. I think these characters were strong enough that they should have slowed things down and developed them a little more thoroughly. Maybe John Hughes could have done a better job, but still Schumacher does his best.Most of the problems these characters face do happen to real people to some degree or another. We've all had crushes like Estevez, and they can be truly humiliating. Some of the financial trouble that Moore and Lowe are experiencing can often be cured by simply making better decisions. Those two appeared to be the most screwed up, and least likely to make it in the long run. But at 22, you still have plenty of time left to make things right. Perhaps there is a script out there that covers these characters 20 years down the line, and tells us what they're up to now.The film grossed just under $40 million and is still worth a viewing today. Hard to believe it was rated ""R"" when it was released.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",St. Elmo's Fire
40,jem132,"The characters were unlikeable, but I still liked this movie",7,2 July 2009,"Director Joel Schumacher assembled much of the key members of the 80's ""Brat Pack"" for this comedy-drama about University graduate friends struggling to deal with life in the ""real world"". Great concept, fun film, yet only a couple of the characters are actually likable. The rest all rub you up the wrong way. Emilio Estevez's character for example. He basically stalks Andie MacDowell for the whole film, and that's it. Rob Lowe is pretty much a loser who has to rely on his friends for starts in jobs, and treats the girl who silently loves him like crap. Judd Nelson, a career climber, professes love of his girl Ally Sheedy (gorgeous and actually likable), yet cheats on her with random girls. Demi Moore's party girl Jules (what happened to Moore's career after this? She could actually act and had screen presence??) and Sheedy's character are the only really identifiable characters. Maybe, maybe Andrew Carthy too-- if only I could look at him without thinking ""Why the hell did Molly get with HIM at the end of ""Pretty In Pink""?"".",St. Elmo's Fire
41,Tito-8,Several characters ruin the whole movie,5,26 September 1999,"For reasons that I can't quite explain, I had really wanted to see this film since it was first released, yet somehow I only just watched it a few weeks ago.  Now I am confused as to why I wanted to see it in the first place. It was by no means bad, but a movie like this needed a bunch of likable characters in order for me to like it.  Unfortunately, many of the people in this movie are real losers, and there was no reason for me to be sympathetic when one of them encountered some major stumbling block.  It was watchable, occasionally amusing, and at first it was fun to see such a well-known cast, but this movie wears thin pretty quickly.",St. Elmo's Fire
42,Isaac5855,A Brat Pack Guilty Pleasure,6,12 January 2007,"It's not Shakespeare, but ST. ELMO'S FIRE was a great guilty pleasure from the 1980's that is still watchable thanks to its charismatic cast. In another variation of THE BIG CHILL, this film follows a group of Georgetown college students a year after graduation and the different paths their lives have taken even though their friendships remain flawed but solid. Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are now living together and Nelson's Alec is now pushing Sheedy's Leslie to get married even though he constantly cheats on her claiming marriage will make him faithful. Andrew McCarthy plays Kevin, an aspiring writer who everyone is convinced is gay because he has been in love from a distance for many years and won't talk about it. Emilio Estevez is a waiter who becomes obsessed with romancing a doctor (Andie McDowell) who he went out on one date with in college. Mare Winninghan is now a social worker who is in love with Billy, played by Rob Lowe. Billy is an aspiring musician and aimless drifter who's been through 20 jobs since graduation and is lost without school. Demi Moore shines as Jules, the party girl who slept with everyone in college and whose partying lifestyle is starting to catch up with her. It's not deep or meaningful, but it's a lot fun and the cast is game.",St. Elmo's Fire
43,oOoBarracuda,St. Elmo's FIre,1,20 April 2017,"There are collections of despicable characters, and then there's St. Elmo's Fire.Kirby (Emilio Estevez): ""She is the only evidence of God I have seen with the exception of the mysterious force that removes one sock from the dryer every time I do my laundry."" This guy spent a majority of the movie stalking and attempting to sexually assault someone that smiled at him in college. A truly problematic personality that often tends towards illegal activity which is odd since his career aspirations seemed to be in law. I LOVED his Woody Allen paraphernalia all over his apartment, though.Billy (Rob Lowe): ""So you lost your job? I've lost twenty of them since graduation. Plus a wife and kid. And, in a new development this morning, a handful of hair in the shower drain."" This guy was a real peach. He practically abandoned his wife and child yet wouldn't grant her the divorce she wanted because he was intent on changing, yet, with no steps or methods to do so. Forcing someone to stay legally bound to you is pretty much as low as it gets.Kevin (Andrew McCarthy): ""Love, love is an illusion created by lawyer types like yourself to perpetuate another illusion called marriage to create the reality of divorce and then the illusionary need for divorce lawyers."" I actually quite enjoyed this character through most the film. Kevin was constantly spouting philosophical views on life and love that were unpopular amongst his friends but taken for what he is. I'm the Kevin in my social circles, that brings Hegel up in casual conversation but never gets to enjoy the level of acceptance his character does. When it is revealed, however, that Kevin isn't speaking from an ascribed philosophical method, but rather because he is brooding and entitled believing his friend to have gotten the girl that was for him, his entire persona is revealed to be a caricature.Alec (Judd Nelson): ""Dinosaurs are obsolete. Marriage is still around."" This guy was especially infuriating. I've been involved in politics since I was 16, you can't just switch parties because one pays more. I've tried this, no one trusts you since you've been working for the other party so long, plus all your contacts are within that party. Aside from that, this guy repeatedly cheated on his girlfriend because she refused to marry him; I'm sure those two facts were unrelated, though.Jules (Demi Moore): ""I don't know why you're both so worried... So, I bop him for a couple of years, get his job when he gets his hands caught in the vault, do a black mink ad, retire in utter disgrace, then write a best seller and be a fabulous host on my own talk show..."" Yeah, this is your typical person that everyone knows at least one of that wants to make a lot of money and spend even more money but not work. At one point in the film, she had taken over a month's worth of advancement on her pay to ""pinkify"" her apartment and buy a lot of clothes. She also used her sexuality to advance her position whenever she could. The film could have made some statement about what she was trying to fill by spending money so irresponsibly but when her arc did reach its climax she was more upset to not have her material possessions anymore, rather than revealing why she felt as though she needed them in the first place. Oh, she also used the adage ""you're gay and I know someone that's gay so you two will be perfect for each other"" and I just can't adequately describe how much I detest that.Leslie (Ally Sheedy): ""Men... Can't live with 'em, can't shoot 'em."" Despite that glowing outlook on a certain subset of the population, this was one of the easier characters to tolerate. Her character almost solely existed as someone else's counterpart which is more than frustrating but that problem rests on the filmmaker than the character. I mean, did she ever talk about anything other than Alec? Barely.Wendy (Mare Winningham): Again, one of the more likable characters which is truly fortunate as I needed some glimmer of something to hang onto in an otherwise dreadful film. Wendy was expected to live at home until she was married which led to her father practically auctioning off the rest of her life to potential suitors. Again, her character arc centered around a man so this will never be considered a feminist film, but Wendy's is one that you can almost feel a bit of sympathy towards.Again, a film doesn't require likable characters, as long as the film own that they're terrible people. It's when a film is asking me to sympathize with characters with no redeeming qualities that problems ensue.",St. Elmo's Fire
44,statuskuo,Buh-Rat Pack,6,14 November 2014,"I once asked my gay friend why this movie spoke so much to the homosexual community. His response was that it was unapologetically 80's crass mixed with colorful disasters. Apparently he's spent his whole life living down day-glo characters like Jules, neighbor Ron, or Hollywood from ""Mannequinn.""So here you have some straight out of college friends, who use to congregate at a local bar and wax about life, love and the pursuit of adulthood. A lot of this, when scratch below the surface is pretty appropriate today as it was in the 80's. A lot of people who were ""promised"" one thing but given another. A lot of overspending. A lot of poor relationship choices, psycho love forlorn stalking, and love unrequited. Friends banging other friend's girls. And a carousel of other oddities that come with an age group that is often times overlooked. Much like I am closer to my 40's now. No one cares. Not only that no one cares, you should stop whining. And I believe this may turn a lot of people off to these characters. They're self-absorbed entitled jerks. Surprisingly with a Georgetown education. They haven't made much of themselves, but as young and inexperience, there is also the changing tides as they venture into the world. What the world offers them, they aren't prepared for. It's harsh. And they have to find a way to cope. Not to give anything away (as it is from '87). One gets the feeling that when Rob Lowe gets to NY, he will likely be robbed, raped and left for dead. Probably with his saxophone jammed up his rear. That is the reality of life.",St. Elmo's Fire
45,mcfly-31,"tepid flame, at best....",5,7 June 2010,"Sudsy, coming-of-adulthood flick that follows seven friends post-college graduation. Real Life trials are supposed to be the driving force behind the story, but these seven don't exactly dive right in. Their ""problems"" consist of work, relationship, crush, and despising of modern society, among other things.Now any of those things can be turned into a pot-boiler, as could be found on any prime-time television show of the 80s. But this film format doesn't really come off, and leaves you underwhelmed. Here's the cast's problems: Moore compromises herself at work, Estevez lusts for an older woman, Winningham is being forced into a marriage, Sheedy and Nelson rough it playing house, Lowe drifts and plays sax, and McCarthy is the cynical, observation-spouting one. And nothing they are involved in has any punch to it.Sure, there's some sleep-arounds, cocaine problems, and near-death on a fire escape, but no sense of real urgency among any of the characters. The most inept of the story lines belongs to Estevez, who after not seeing a former classmate for years, essentially begins stalking her. And MacDowell's flattered(!!) reactions to this are senselessly implausible (I kept waiting for him to wake up during the ""dip kiss"" moment).Lowe wails on his sax, bemoans his ex and kid, and seems obsessed with Winningham's virginity status. Nelson thinks he can only sexually commit with marriage, Moore bangs her boss when her payday advance runs out, on and on. My patience was wearing thin for some cataclysmic moment that would bring down the house, but it never arrived. The characters left the film the same way they came in with me: bores.The most glaring thing I have to get back to is the lack of urgency mentioned. Moore locked inside the apartment, Lowe accosting Moore in the jeep, Nelson's indignant reactions toward the end. There was never that WOW moment that shatters friendships and elevates films like this. For whatever reason, Schumacher often goes for a completely out-of-place laugh, then a simple tie-up later on. The sight of Sheedy walking arm-and-arm with her prospective beaus, and the awkward love scene toward the last five minutes makes one queasy. Not to mention one of the most forced, moronic last lines in filmdom.The success of this film back in the day was obviously driven by the attraction of the cast. And they are lookers. Well, Winningham somehow ended up in there, but six outta seven ain't bad. But probably the most enduring element of this ""classic,"" is the striking, powerful score by David Foster. Which gave birth to one of the most lasting love themes ever written.So, that's something.",St. Elmo's Fire
46,alainenglish,Poignant look at growing up after school,8,1 April 2007,"Ahead of its time in the way it portrays the angst of twenty-something graduates who are having it hard growing up, ""St Elmos Fire"" is an endearing and poignant watch. I don't know how many people out there will identify with a bunch of rich, spoilt young white folks suddenly cast out into the real world, but I identified with these characters and for me the movie worked.The cast is made up almost entirely of the famous ""Brat Pack"" group from the Eighties, but the performances all delivered to a high standard with some sterling director work from Joel Schumacher. Each character has a different dilemma: Kirby (Emilio Estevez) is going all out to impress the girl of his dreams; Billy (Rob Lowe) is a drunkard with a wife and a kid, who wastes his talent as a musician; Leslie (Ally Sheedy) and Alec (Judd Nelson) are stuck in a relationship that is rapidly going nowhere; Jules (Demi Moore) is a deluded, self-destructive liar and Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) is a writer who does little other than hanker after the good times and ponder the meaning of life...I liked the point of this story: the necessity to face the real world in order to move on with your life, accept who you are and make the best of your talents. I really liked Rob Lowe, who makes you feel for Billy, and Demi Moore, who is also touching despite the fact her character is selfish and hopelessly self-dramatising. The pair of them have a good scene near the end of the movie, where the two of them together find peace within themselves.That aside, the general chemistry between the leads (who obviously know and bounce off each other very well) holds its own and make the failed relationships and lousy jobs the characters endure seem real.

That said, this film is entertaining to watch occasionally when it comes on cable, but it wouldn't be one I'd want to own (or even rent).  It really is dated, and not in a very ""good way"" -- it doesn't make me feel nostalgic for the 80's at all, whereas certain other films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and even ""Pretty in Pink"" sit much better in that department.  All that said, it is fun in a soap opera-ish sort of way, and I like watching the ""brat packers"" at the height of their form... makes me feel a bit younger, maybe.

A good decade before bringing a perfectly good ""Batman"" franchise to its knees, writer/director Joel Schumacher did what few films could do with the ""Brat Pack"" in tow. That is, he created a film that dared to be over-dramatic and dared to touch upon the ugliness of growing up long after the security of school and family has faded. While some characters and their stories are questionable (Emilio Estevez, I'm looking at you), the little stories that make up their day-to-day life are, for the most part, stuff that everyone goes through, and none of the actors seem ashamed to look ridiculous in portraying the selfish, the immature and the inexperienced. For the most part, the characters feel real, and that's why the film works as well as it does.Perhaps it's a little too over-dramatic and self-indulgent for its own good, but maybe that's the point. All seven characters are colorful, albeit, horribly flawed human beings, and it shows in the most awkward and endearing moments of the film. You may not understand their decisions or why they choose to bring so much drama down on themselves, but you'll at least relate to it in one way or another. How you interpret and appreciate the film rests both in your position in life and whether or not you can recognize the biggest flaws in yourself. It's a film that will speak volumes to anyone fresh out of college, in their 20's or with the hindsight to realize how silly and self-made much of the drama in their life has been.",St. Elmo's Fire
49,kingofdanerds,Entirely Watchable but won't win everyone over,6,17 July 2021,"Of all the Brat Pack films, St. Elmo's Fire is probably the most divisive amongst fans of the Brat Pack. Released in 1985, the same year as The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire was written and directed by Joel Schumacher. The film stars Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Mare Winningham, and Andie MacDowell. The film proved to be a financial success but was not so much of a critical success.A group of seven friends are recent graduates of Georgetown. Each individual has their own issues whether it is love, money, or jobs.....St. Elmo's Fire is fascinating in a strange way. Let's get the obvious positives out of the way here. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. So much so that I actually own it on cassette. The acting is fairly good here and it should come as no surprise because I have seen these actors in previous films, namely the Breakfast Club. There are some shots in this film where they are gorgeous. Check out the one shot where our characters get in a Jeep and drive on down the road. The style of the film is appealing too. It is a melodrama and I do not know why, but for some reason I like films like that or at least find them appealing. Where this film fails is in it's characters. The characters or not very likeable. One cheats on his girlfriend and says he will stop till she marries him. Another is a coke head and another is a drunk. That is three out of seven characters that I find unlikable. The other characters range from decent to uninteresting. They are unlikable because of their attitude and actions. Sure, they are facing real life issues, but most of the time, they bring it all on themselves. But what is interesting is when these characters are interacting with each other because the acting is fairly good.St. Elmo's Fire won't win everyone over with it's unlikable characters but if you like syrupy 80s melodramas, you'll find this film to be watchable.",St. Elmo's Fire
50,David_Frames,"You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man!",3,23 November 2006,"In fifty years time when cinema has passed into obsolesce, much as we look at the gramophone today, what in the name of Kiefer Sutherland will film historian's make of Joel Schumacher? Will our children's children regard the man who made a career from filling the screen with mawkish sentimentality and degenerate teenagers as a screen God or pony tailed Satan? Well if they're reading this then hopefully the latter but as our kids will be born deformed and retarded because of the chemicals sluicing around our reproductive tubing I'm not taking any chances, in fact I'm posting this review as a time capsule so even if Schumacher's people kill everyone who ever saw Batman and Robin, burn all the prints and use an EMP pulse bomb to destroy every computer in the world that ever held user reaction to it, people will at least know about St Elmo's Fire  which sounds like a bad accident and turns out to be just that.If you remember the 1980's then congratulations, you're at least 26 and so a number of years too old to enjoy this frankly baffling bit of Brat Pack, life affirming, existential ejaculate. It stars the only six people under 30 in America with an equity card during the era, Estevez (the short one with the bad hair cut), Sheedy (pretty in an skewered kind of way), Lowe (life), McCarthy (Mannequin!), Moore (is less) and Nelson (er,). They're the incredibly rich, trust fund backed upstarts who graduate from Georgetown University and then find themselves in the midst of various crisis', crisis' which test those adolescent bonds borne from the frat house.Around the time this was made John Hughes was trotting out undemanding fare with most of this cast like you and I might make cereal. He wrote Weird Science in three days, the Breakfast Club in five and Feris Bueller in the afternoon break between the two. You can see why Schumacher looked at him and thought, 'Christ this is easy' and so stealing Hudges book of contact numbers he grabbed the usual suspects, got someone to write the accompanying power ballad and waited for the box office to roll in. The only problem was that whereas Hughes had wit and something approaching understanding of the preoccupations of his audience, Schumacher is a hack  in short what Emilio is to acting so Joel is to directing. He forgot, as Hughes seldom did that in order for his audience to identify with the characters they must first find them sympathetic, which means not having your main protagonists as a bunch of spoilt ba*tards with serious emotional and psychological problems. It doesn't matter how deep the issues, if my screenplay is about a bunch of Hitler youth volunteers with family problems I'm not going to snare may viewers. So, alright they're brats but at least they're endearing brats, right? Well no. Emilio is an insane stalker, harassing poor, rabbit in the headlights love interest Andy McDowell. Low and Nelson are love cheats with an obvious contempt for women and, oh yes the girls  you've got a frigid prissy prick tease, a coke addict and Ally Sheedy.On their own any of these problems could sink the ship but Schumacher took his listing vessel and machine gunned the women and children in the lifeboats before returning to ply the deck with plastic explosive. The plot so stupid it could have been written by the freak from the Goonies. It's so stupid in fact that Demi Moore was nearly fired because while playing a drug addict she was actually a drug addict. Schumacher obviously thought a clean actress would give a more credible performance. In fact at the film's climax she confirms that getting the push might have been a good option. A 'suicide' attempt has the fawning friends scrambling to break in and save her life. Has she slit her wrists? Hung herself with the strap from her dressing gown? No, in the Eighties people killed themselves very slowly by sitting in front of an open window. ""She'll freeze to death!"" cries a stricken Lowe. ""I think that's the idea"" someone shouts back. What? Freeze to death by sitting in front of the window? Where's the apartment, Siberia? What's the hurry, you could wait for the place to be sold before she'd perish at those temperatures but in a film where Estevez can kiss his victim and make her love him, thus fulfilling every pervert's fantasy and that victim is the doe eyed Andy McDowell who's about as magnetic as a cup of sawdust, it's all par for the course.Schumacher's made worse of course  Batman and Robin is about as poor as it gets for anyone unless you're Judd Nelson's agent but St Elmo's Fire is the one that doesn't so much offend as make the head itch all-night. Just what did anyone think it was all about? Young love? Life? Becoming an Adult? Damned if I know but I certainly won't be leaving the window open again any time soon. I like life, even if on this evidence it hates my guts.",St. Elmo's Fire

He thinks marrying her will get him to settle down and stop messing around on her.Andrew McCarthy is in love with someone he can't have...he can't help it!

52,Matthew_Capitano,One of my top ten favorite films,10,8 August 2013,"""The aroma of the fall season is presented here through atmosphere.Joel Schumacher's late calendar film about seven D.C.-area post-grad college students trying to find a new path to follow is a serio-comic look at one of life's most common human endeavors. Rob Lowe, Ally Sheedy, Andy McCarthy, and Mare Winningham stand out by making their particular characters the most interesting. Dumi Moore, Judd Nelson, and especially Emilio Estevez are less appealing in burn-off roles as they play various low-lifes including a junkie, a cheater, and a stalker.A special movie, not only for fans of the 'brat pack', but for romanticists of autumn and leaves-on-the-ground fall.",St. Elmo's Fire
53,budmassey,"This movie is silly, shallow, pointless and dull.",2,29 May 2005,"St. Elmo's Fire represents everything that is bad about every generation since the Flower Children. They all grew up with a sense of entitlement that led them to expect great jobs, lots of money, fabulous apartments and the freedom to indulge every whim the instant it occurs. What never occurs to them, as with the characters in this stinkbomb, is that life can be difficult, mundane, demanding and frustrating.Did you ever wonder why the kids in such films always have a wardrobe that would make the racks at Sacks look barren, or why their spacious and trendy apartments are always decorated professionally, or why, only days after college, they have assumed leadership roles in the most elite businesses? Well, guess what. It doesn't work that way.In the end, these silly music video contrivances turn SEF into just that, a silly music video littered with preening, pouting, self-absorbed posers pretending they know what it's like establishing life as an adult. Let's not forget the entire cast have been stars since before they sprouted pubic hair, and so coming of age is not a theme on which they can draw substantially from their own lives. Of course, the writer, Joel Schumacher, was born pre-WWII, so young adulthood in the '80's was not exactly his area of expertise either.This movie is silly, shallow, pointless and dull. There is no reason to identify with any of the characters, and the whole exercise was nothing more than a shameless attempt to capitalize on Breakfast Club and the success of the Brat Pack. Positively dreadful.",St. Elmo's Fire

That was it.As far as I'm concerned, I'm not impressed... but then again, I never expected anything less. This movie was directed by the same person that directed Batman and Robin; another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow.Now for the verdict: it's a 1 out of 10.",St. Elmo's Fire
55,Davalon-Davalon,A mistake,1,24 May 2019,"No matter how bad a movie might be, I usually soldier on until the end. As a screenwriter, it's important for me to understand what it is that enabled a movie to be made. In this case, it is impossible to understand much of anything.I of course had heard of this movie because, as a musician, I often played the theme song to ""St. Elmo's Fire."" Trust me, it is the only good thing about this travesty, and in fact, I feel bad for the composers as this theme song was so elegant and sophisticated that it's a pity it ended up in such a piece of trash.It's fascinating, watching this mistake with 2019 eyes at how Hollywood perceived itself in 1985. Of course all stars had to be white. The two people of color that I saw in the 45 hellish minutes I endured were a black male (police officer) and black female (prostitute).I found it tragic, insulting, degrading, pathetic, disturbing and sad that this is what Hollywood did to people that weren't white. And in fact, if you watch a vast swath of films from the past, people of color are generally in some sort of service profession (nurses, guards, maids, janitors), often times judges (why? to show how ""progressive"" the producers are?) or as prostitutes or, as recent as 2019, drug dealers (""Homekilling Queen"").That said, the ""white people"" in this film are uniquely uninteresting, every single one of them. There was not one that I cared about nor had any remote desire to get to know on any level. There is no explanation why this bizarre group of ""friends"" is joined at the hip, but they are. Because... they went to college together?Here are things that I remember, in no particular order, that bothered me:Mare Winnigham was presented as this virginesque Jewish girl who had a crush on drunken cheater Rob Lowe. Although it is fascinating to note that Mare eventually converted to Judaism (2003), there is no way in hell that she would be considered Jewish in this movie, despite the insultingly stereotypical Jewish family she is a member of. As a Jew, I wept for the actors who had to portray the people in this film that the producers thought were ""Jewish.""Rob Lowe is drunk and Mare is in his car and they have an accident and she has a bandage on her head because of his stupidity, but he continues to act drunk and mentally challenged. And that's interesting... because?Demi Moore seems to be playing some actress on drugs. I guess she is independently wealthy and has nothing to do but kiss her female co-stars on the cheek and smoke. Her voice sound ragged throughout the film and I could not understand what the point of her role was.Emilio Estevez is obsessed with Andie MacDowell and stalks her stupidly. And... he's interesting because?Judd Nelson wants to marry Ally Sheedy -- and she's not ready. Okay... so?Everyone seems to live in big giant houses that are as large as warehouses.Their precious private worlds must have been interesting to the rich, spoiled, obnoxious people who put this project together, but I cannot find a single thing of interest to recommend other than the theme song and the shocking pink of Demi Moore's apartment, of course thrown together by her ""gay"" designer friend.This film should have never been made and it is a sad comment on what Hollywood believed was commercial.The pendulum has swung entirely the other way, and even though I am white and I am a screenwriter, and I feel I am missing out on opportunities because I am not considered ""diverse,"" if what is happening now will protect us from the insulting injuries of films like this, then that is a good thing. Unwatchable.",St. Elmo's Fire
56,Solnichka,Much Better with Age,9,5 January 2001,"The first time I saw this movie, I was still in high school, and the plot came off as being a little self-indulgent and weak. However, I caught the movie on cable recently, and with age, experience and perspective, the plot really shines. Looking back to my post-collegiate years, I actually could identify with every character in one sense or another (except Kirby - his role could have been dropped and the film wouldn't have missed a beat).Watching the struggles of each character as they try to find their way (and themselves) in a new world delivers the message it should - that everything changes, and we need to change constantly in order to negotiate our way through life. It's the rare individual who can maintain sanity through life's changes, and each character experiences those moments on insanity necessary to mature and move on to the next challenge.Judd Nelson is excellent, once again proving he was a master at portraying the arrogant jerk. Ally Sheedy, probably my favorite actress of the 1980s, shines in a sophisticated way, trying hard to maintain an honest coolness in the face of emotional adversity. Andrew McCarthy plays his usual role as the tender, somewhat vulnerable good guy who never seems to get it right. Rob Lowe as the insensitive, irresponsible guy everyone loves anyway - this is probably one of his best 1980s roles, next to ""Masquerade."" Demi Moore is passable as the glamour wannabe girl we all know, who just can't seem to be honest with everyone including herself. Perhaps the one who steals the show is Mare Winningham, who melts your heart with her honesty and innocence.All in all, an entertaining and realistic, heartfelt film for anyone over 25.",St. Elmo's Fire

58,pyotr-3,"Vapid, boring, and homophobic",1,10 May 2002,"This film shows the lives of a group of friends who just graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, DC.   I never saw a more vapid and uninteresting group of spoiled, useless brats in my life.  There is no storyline to speak of, and it's hard to imagine anyone caring one bit about these people.  To make matters worse, the film is tinged with a few homophobic moments which are demeaning to gay viewers and anyone who believes that all people deserve respect.  I think it is a safe bet that all the stars of this film are probably embarrassed to have been associated with it today, though it helped launch the careers of some good actors.",St. Elmo's Fire
59,T-ZER0,No one said Adulthood was easy,3,27 July 2020,"St. Elmo's Fire had all the ingredients to be a classic 80s brat pack movie. It had some noteworthy actors, a book-cover plot and a super catchy, a hangout in the form of a bar and an amazing theme song ""St Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion).Directed by the recently late Joel Schumacher. This was his attempt at making a brat pack movie similar to the Breakfast Club. The main problem with this film although is that it's misguided and messy.When I was watching it, I first felt that there were too many main characters. There are about seven, each have their own life problems which makes it even worse for someone like me to keep track of who is who or what problem is what.I will admit, some of the stuff in the movie gave me good 80s vibes. Like the St. Elmo's Fire bar, and the theme song. However, Schumacher himself is not good at making movies that potray people as, how do you put it normal. (Example: Chase Meridian in Batman Forever is the worst psychologist in the history of cinema).Furthering on that point, Emilio Estévez plays Kirby, who is in love with a girl named Dale. And repeatedly makes attempts to go on a date with her. It's a terrible plot point because he never asked if she was seeing anyone, still, I'll shove that aside because I sort of felt sorry for him.Demi Moore plays a drug addict who supposedly had a job that she kept by sleeping with her boss. Later towards the end we learn that she didn't have the job. Leading to a overdramatic, out of place, suicide attempt. Just apply for another job!Besides that, the other characters have their own issues. I guess the light of this movie is the scene where Billy talks about the fictional ""St. Elmo's Fire"". I like that because it seems like he's addressing the title of the movie, the theme song and the bar name all at the same time, and John Parr, the singer/songwriter of the theme song verified that what Billy said about St. Elmo's Fire was the same thing he was talking about in his song.So, is this worth a watch? Maybe you could watch it once, just to remember the 80s as they once were. As for watching it several times? I wouldn't think so, I heard they are making a tv show of this, I hope it takes its time when explaining the backstories of the characters instead of rushing them all like this film did.",St. Elmo's Fire
60,cutterccbaxter,Why The 80s Sucked: Exhibit A - This Movie,1,26 May 2005,"I noticed ""Fire"" was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I couldn't recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in '85. Twenty years later the film is still awful. Besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them. And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe's character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unappealing, although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing, and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon.",St. Elmo's Fire
61,walsh-22,Not my favourite Brat Pack movie,7,8 June 2007,"I kept missing the start of the film every time it was on TV so I took matters into my own hands and rented the movie.The plot of the film is about 7 friends living in Washington DC who have graduated from University and are now in jobs accept Billy (Rob Lowe) who keeps loosing them because he still sees himself as a frat boy who parties and sleeps around, even though he has a wife and child. Jules (Demi Moore) is in banking but has money problems, probably due to her drug use. She is always getting herself in trouble and calling her friends to bale her out. Alec (Judd Nelson) works for a congressman and he is the father of the group who is always there for his friends, which you have to laugh at, the different type of character he is playing in this to The Breakfast Club shot in the same year where he played a troublemaker. He wants to marry his partner Leslie but can't stop his adulterous ways. Leslie (Ally Sheedy) loves Alec but is not sure about marrying him. (What a wise girl). Wendy (Mare Winningham) comes from a wealthy family and is under their thumb. She works at the Dept. of Human Resources. She loves Billy but doesn't have any confidence in herself. Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) writes obituaries for the newspaper but wants to be a proper journalist. He is also secretly in love with his friend's partner. Kirby (Emilio Estevez) is a waiter at a bar who wants to be a lawyer. He sees his first love Andie MacDowell and begins an obsessive love affair but she is clearly not interested. Silly woman, she is mad turning down Emilio. He tries all these different ways to woo her but in the end realises she is with someone. They go through their trials and challenges and at the end, in some cases, their lives are dramatically changed from the start of the film-Leslie decides to be on her own, Wendy gets her own apartment, Billy leaves DC to move to New York and Kirby quits his waiters job to pursue a career in Law.I have to say this isn't my favourite Brat Pack movie but it does have some good points to it. For one, although it is set in the 80's, this could apply to any teenagers at anytime who have to grow up and leave behind childhood in a way and be responsible for themselves. I can definitely relate to this as I am at that stage myself and am finding it hard to embrace all the responsibilities that goes along with adulthood.Another good thing about the film is it is not like the other fluffy, feel good movies churned out in the 80's, this doesn't have a happy ending, none of the friends find love but they do stay friends. The film deals with romantic obsession, drug use, adultery, forbidden love, unfulfilled dreams, real serious issues. I have to say I was disappointed Leslie didn't pick Kevin as he was so much better than Alec.",St. Elmo's Fire

The characters range from dreary and dull, to loathsome and despicable. Who wrote this screenplay? Seriously.I get that its meant as a slice of life from the mid-80s. I'm roughly the same age as the characters in the film, and I went to a prestigious college in 1984. I couldn't find anything at all true or relatable in this mess.How bad was the cast? How many of them are still employable actors today? Rob Lowe performs as a parody of himself, Demi Moore's Tits and Ass days are over, so she's a has been. That's it!

I have nothing in common with any of the characters, but isn't a movie a kind of escapism? I'm English and this is a time and place in America that I like to think existed, but know really didn't. So now and again I whack it in the DVD player and transport myself to a time you could run off to New York with just your sax and a head full of dreams while your gaggle of quirky friends cry and wave you goodbye... ah the 80s. Such a film would not be made now. If I could however I would find a way to cut Emilio Estevez out of the film. Like completely. The character creeps me out and don't understand the point of him or his ridiculous celebration following his awful pouncing on poor Andie McDowell.Other than that the other characters and their various intertwining stories are interesting enough and are made better by the brat pack themselves. I really can't explain why but I hated this film back in the day... maybe I realise that sometimes you need that earnest type of film only the 80s can deliver. And St Elmos does that. See?

Fortunately, for this group of friends, they've got each other to help get through. Unfortunately, that may be more of a hindrance than a help...The movie centers on seven recent graduates of Georgetown University: Alec (Judd Nelson), the group ringleader, who's a political aide. He shares an apartment with Leslie (Ally Sheedy), whom he would like to marry in spite of his penchant for infidelity. Leslie suspects this, and is a little hesitant to say yes. Their friend Kevin (Andrew McCarthy) is a budding journalist with a secret crush on Leslie. He shares an apartment with Kirby (Emeilio Estevez), whose crush on a Georgetown alum (Andie McDowell) borders on obsession. Then there's Jules (a redheaded Demi Moore), the wild woman of the group, who sleeps with her boss, lives beyond her means, and thinks Kevin is gay and that it is up to her to help him come out. Virginal Wendy (Mare Winningham, who, ironically, was pregnant at the time) is the daughter of a wealthy family, who would simply like her to marry so her husband can set up a franchise. Wendy would rather be a social worker and date Billy (Rob Lowe). Billy is perhaps the most messed up of the group, married with a baby daughter, but dating Wendy, and trying to fool around with Jules, he plays sax in a band, but cannot hold a job down to save his life, and doesn't realize that a simple ""sorry"" will not fix his mistakes. With friends like these...The movie presents the trials and tribulations of these characters with considerable charm. Their problems are over the top, but you can't help liking them. And in the end, they have learned something, almost in spite of themselves.The performances are uniformly strong. Moore and Estevez go over the top with their characters, and yet manage to show a vulnerability in each that is very sweet. Lowe also plays over the top with Billy, giving a performance that makes him a likable rapscallion. Nelson's smoldering stare works well with Alec's intensity, and belies the destructive temper that lashes out toward the end of the film. Alec's ability to ultimately forgive the two who betray him shows his growth in a most satisfying way. Winningham gives a sensitive portrait of a young woman using her desire to help others as a way to keep from dealing with her own problems. Sheedy gives a wonderful portrayal of a woman caught between her love for her boyfriend, and her need to be on her own for a little while. McCarthy's performance is wonderfully complex as a young man whose cynicism hides his longing for something he cannot have. Kevin's coping with having and then ultimately losing his dream is done skillfully, and you are with him every step of the way.An interesting and entertaining film - well worth watching or watching again.",St. Elmo's Fire

It is probably one of the most underrated films of it's time. The irony of it is that Alley Sheedy, Emilio Estevez and Judd Neslon are three of the five kids in The Breakfast Club.Young, innocent and totally vulnerable.

68,rams_lakers,St. Elmos Garbage,1,29 December 2009,"There were many 80's movies that I loved when I took the time to go see them at local theaters and drive-ins. Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Blues Brothers, Road Warrior, Breakfast Club, and Stripes among many others.Then there were those that I missed but later saw on video or cable that I loved just as much. Risky Business, Just One of the Guys, Better off Dead, Woman in Red, Sixteen Candles, National Lampoon's Vacation, Fletch, Valley Girl, Revenge of the Nerds, Back to the Future, 3 O'Clock High, Weird Science and countless more.Many of these movies (and others unlisted) defined the 80's for me. I can watch them again and be taken back to a century that I truly loved.Then there were the 80's movies that I missed, purposefully or otherwise. Some of these I still haven't seen because they look totally uninteresting. Pretty in Pink, Footloose, and St. Elmo's Fire are some that I chose not to experience. They all appeared very unappealing to me for the actors and themes. Kevin Bacon as a dancer? Pretty boy Rob Lowe? Pass.I've seen bits and pieces of Elmo's Fire on cable, not enough to have stored in memory, but enough to know that I did the right thing by skipping it when it came out. I'm not interested at all in the conquests of Rob Lowe, nor do I care about the slutty adventures of Demi Moore. Andrew McCarthy is a bore, and Judd Nelson will always be ""John Bender"" to me. I can't see him getting into politics! In my opinion this movie does not define the 80's at all. I didn't know any rich fantasy people who dressed in high fashion like this, and didn't care to. These characters were self absorbed and unlikeable. The dialogue is bad and the acting is average at best. If you want to experience the real 80's then see some of the films at the top of my list. Try Streets of Fire with Michael Pare - NOT St. Elmo's Fire with Rob Lowe. Forget the soundtrack. Nothing memorable here either. Music in the 80's was much better than that. Instead of his mediocre St. Elmo's Fire song try listening to John Parr's ""Naughty Naughty"" which is much more powerful. Take it from someone who lived through the 80's.

But suffice it to say- St Elmo's Fire was pretty crap-freaking- tastic, even as far as Brat Pack films go.Here is yet another lovely example of the smug, self-indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s (RENT, anyone?) The plot is virtually non- existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best, poorly delivered the rest of the time. The complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn't help the situation. There really was no growth, no forward movement at all. Even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in. Each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest, most predictable way possible. The Stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is gorgeous. The Jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is, well, a jackass. The Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful, deep pain (and some serious emotional imbalances) with a tragically wild lifestyle. The Poet moods and mopes around for a full 3/4 of the film until he can reveal (!) he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows. The Virgin finally becomes a whole, happy human being after getting every Virgin's desire of one hot roll in the sack with a Jackass before he ditches her to really change (for real this time). The Cheating Bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught. And finally The Feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters ""commitment"".Which brings me to my final beef- what bond of super-cement was holding these people together as friends? I can't imagine being with just one of them- Now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar. And they were all so terrible to each other- heads in toilets, near rape, and sleeping around with everrrryone. The cherry was after two BFFs act like total baboons after screwing the Feminist, she's like, ""umm, actually I don't want to be with either of you anymore. Let's be friends! And we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that I may hook up with one or the other at any given point, but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment (NOT THAT WORD!).""

70,CatfishOpinions,unfortunately boring,5,30 April 2020,"Every year or so I'll put this movie on again in hopes that it won't be as boring as I remember from last time. But I'm sorry it's really boring.It sucks because I love 80s drama/coming-of-age/brat pack movies, so this isn't any kind of hate on the genre. The movie is set up with a bunch of interesting characters with their own stories, their own troubles in life, but it just drags on and on with unpleasant real world event after unpleasant real world event. There's a lot of funny lines and some iconic moments, and you definitely feel the comradery of the group at the very beginning, but other than that it just feels like a waste of 2 hours.Also this is a random complaint but the movie has this theme, that's like this dainty sweet little melody that they play at the beginning that makes you go ""wow, what a cute theme to go with a cute friend group"" but then they keep using it over and over to the point where it's like, does the music even fit the movie?? There's like cheating and family drama and bar fights and then they play the dainty little melody again and it makes me think they used this song for the wrong movie. Like it sounds like some wholesome disney golf competition movie ost (does that make sense) instead of this ""the real world"" type drama. Anyway i just thought that was annoying.So I really wish this movie was something special because I love the genre, but it really just makes you think you could've done something more worthwhile for those 2 hours instead of watching it.",St. Elmo's Fire

Judd Nelson does his 'John Bender' imitation, Andy McCarthy is pretty cool as a writer, and Emilio Estevez.... *cough*.... all I can say - the nicest thing I can say about this idiot - is that this is his only good film because his part is a likable one and he ain't too bad in it.... but he's still an idiot.Recommended as a fun Saturday night rental.",St. Elmo's Fire
72,Eaglegrafix,What Happened in the Making of this Movie?,1,27 February 2008,"What happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is? Just one year after ""The Breakfast Club"", a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles.Was it the directing or the writing. Since it was the same person (Joel Schumacher) it must be both. But then Schumacher has since given us ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Phone Booth"", ""A Time to Kill"", and two Batman movies, ""Batman and Robin"" and ""Batman Forever"" which range from good to great directing. Something went wrong on ""StEF"" because it has no genius whatsoever, no comedy worth anything, and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life. Example: The character Wendy (a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by Mare Winningham ) reveals to Billy (an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends, drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by Rob Lowe) that she is still a virgin. Billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but Wendy ""is not ready"". Wendy, in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends. Later in the story, when Billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together. Billy is leaving for New York, deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect ""going away gift"" from her to him. And Wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, seems not to be phased at all by this despot. Give me a break. The one thing she can only give once, she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.Many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue.I suppose some may say that ""that was the 80's"" but I remember it was in the ""80's"" that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out.I think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right.As for the technique (not the story), it was terrible as well. It is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. Pick up what is on the editing room floor, put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better...but it still is a horrible movie.Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for St Elmo's Fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that is what I really think happened.",St. Elmo's Fire
73,WilderMovieReviews,A great underrated and often overlooked 80's movie,10,19 March 2012,"In the mid 80's there were a group of young actors known as the ""Brat Pack"". It was made up of up and coming talented actors, many of them starred in a number of films together, St. Elmo's Fire being one of them.The film is about seven University friends and the changes they find themselves going through once they graduate and try to make it as adults. Some thrive and others can't handle the new responsibilities that come with adulthood.The cast is incredible made of Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Andrew McCarthy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Mare Winningham, & Andie MacDowell. All of them bring a special charm to the characters they play. Every actor is great in this film, their friendships seem genuine and come across well. The emotions each character goes through are portrayed exceptionally well. There really isn't a stand out performance of any of the main cast. They are all perfect performances.The characters go through every possible emotion a person can go through, you will be able to empathise with most if not all the situations from debt, love, death, marriage, break ups and infatuation to name a few of them. Even with all seven characters having their own individual stories, the film isn't overloaded. There is a perfect balance between the each one. Each character has their hardships and each finds a resolution in their own way.This is another great one of the great underrated and often overlooked 80's movies, with a great cast, engaging story and a perfect soundtrack. This is watchable time and time again.For a perfect Sunday afternoon film it doesn't get much better than this.",St. Elmo's Fire
74,kurt-2000,I'd Really Like to say....,5,18 December 2017,"....that this was a silly film with dated jokes. But there were a few moral principles in this flick that the '80's generation needed to listen to and view as acted out. They should've filmed the x rated adventures of the '80's brat pack out on the streets of L.A. during this time period and made an unrated documentary for today's youth 30 plus years later, and we could've gotten more value out of that. Too much short sighted planning in the '80's,. so an opportunity lost. Assuming the brat pack wasn't all media hype, which I suspect. It's interesting which careers took off and lasted a lifetime. What happened to Demi's career? What a drag it is growing old, as Mick said. Mare's career held up. Other than Demi, everyone else became less than legendary for a film that some people had way too much fondness for. Was it....the idea of having seven close friends with mixed gender secret romance attraction that people liked? Or is this a chick flick with complicated relationships that women liked. I don't see men defending it. If the jokes had been better, it could've held up like 16 candles. I thought Demi looked very soft and fluffy in this film. Way too much Breakfast Club influence here. But Andie getting a wet kiss at the end, after all that mindless teasing, was justice.",St. Elmo's Fire
75,theojhyman,What were the Eighties like? - See St. Elmo's Fire !,9,2 April 2000,"Come on! Don't be too hard on this movie. It was an innocent eighties brat pack movie with an excellent cast. A film that just can't be made in today's cynical, sarcastic world. When your kid asks you - ""What were the eighties like?"", one film you can show them is St. Elmo's Fire. It has a great cast, and if you grew up in that era, you can always relate to one of the characters and find yourself truly involved in the film. It's funny, it's sad, it's exciting. It is a classic in the fact that people will look back on it as a nostalgic eighties movie and admire it. Plus, the soundtrack contains some great eighties rock classics, especially the amazing title song by John Parr! This is a good movie for watching at college, University or even when it's 2050 and you want to look back on an innocent, fun decade where young people had few worries, except maybe their choice in clothes or their hair style!!!",St. Elmo's Fire
76,jane-42,Lurid fun.,1,19 July 2001,"Sort of like watching an old episode of ""Dynasty""- you'll laugh, but atall the wrong things, and remember how 'cool' you thought the film whenit first came out. It isn't, and the proof is in the pudding, however;it's quite fun to watch Rob Lowe pretending to play the sax, and theother folk with their hair and unfortunate wardrobe choices all swingand sway in time.  The plot is really just 'boys meet girls and they allwhine'- but it's kind of an interesting thing to see how rich andentitled they all are, it somehow perfectly crystalizes the 80's in away. Some good performances, Mare Winningham and Ally Sheedy are thebest I think, or at least the most realistic. They guys all seem to beplaying at being cool, and in fact this film led to the birth of theinfamous ""Brat Pack"", a moniker that I'm sure they'd all like to forget.Shot like a soap opera (witness Demi Moore weeping as the curtainsbillow around her) and scored within an inch of it's breathless life,this is just a monument to excess, proof that teen films ended up goingway too far. Sad really, but interesting and kind of fun at the sametime.",St. Elmo's Fire
77,velcrohead,Can't Get Enough of It,9,14 May 2011,"There are very few films that I will watch a second time. There are even fewer films that I will watch over and over. ""St. Elmo's Fire"" is one of those movies. I seem to need to watch it at least once a year.The theme resonates with me deeply. As someone who fresh out of college was saying ""uh, OK, what now?"" I totally identify with Billy and the rest of the cast. What do you do with your life when you've spent literally all of it in school trying to get from one grade to the next? What do you do when you've finally finished the last level? How do you make the change from being ""young and innocent,"" as suggested by one of the soundtrack's songs, to adulthood?One of the odd things about this movie is that for all intents and purposes there is no real reason that anybody should like these characters. They are all deeply flawed, and it's entirely likely that, were you to know any of them in real life, you might consider them all douchebags or even vile people, certainly not people you'd hope to know. Kirby borders on the psychotic as he stalks Dale, his unrequited college crush. Billy is not only a major lech, but also a deadbeat dad, who tries to rape Jules and also nearly rapes Wendy and certainly humiliates her. Wendy, in turn, is a mousy introvert with almost no self-esteem, who does in the end give herself up to Billy, as much to validate herself as to give a gift to him. Kevin, thought gay by literally everyone else in the movie, is a total loser with an unhealthy obsession with his best friend's girl, whom he ends up sleeping with by preying on her vulnerability and drunkenness after breaking up with Alec. Alec not only cheats on his girlfriend; he cheats a LOT with random women working in department store dressing rooms. He's abusive and pretty much racks up an attempted murder with Kevin later on in the movie. Leslie's not a heck of a lot better, because she jumps straight into the sack with Alec's best friend, and she's basically a tease who gets a free ride in life based on who she's having sex with. And Jules...well, there's no kind way to say it: Jules is a crack-head.At this point you may be wondering ""why do you like this movie so much again?"" Well, that's where the genius of the movie lies. Joel Schumacher gives us these awful, deeply flawed people, and by the end of the movie, he makes you not only like them, but root for them. You're thrilled when Kirby plants one on the girl he's stalked. You're happy to see Billy and Wendy finally do it, right before Billy has to go away. You cry a little for Jules when you find out her life is a total lie.This film is not quite ""The Breakfast Club."" Don't get me wrong. But it's good stuff, and there's something in at least one character that everyone will be able to relate to.",St. Elmo's Fire
78,Cyk,Another great Brat Pack film,8,29 April 1999,"In the tradition of the Brat Pack films of the 80s, this one fits the bill. The six characters are involved in a series of weird love entanglements, and most of the characters are neurotic enough to make anyone laugh. As these old college buddies move through life, we watch them grow and change, and eventually hurt each other beyond repair...except that friendship triumphs in the end, and all is forgiven. It's a feel good movie about close friends. Not exactly a chick flick, but not too far from it, I still recommend it to anyone who likes 80s movies.",St. Elmo's Fire

The bottom line when you look beyond the gloss, is that the typical American male & female act just like these characters. Face it, 99% of all woman are attracted to ""bad boys"". No matter how bad the guy treats them, they're still coming back for more. Face it, people want the good things in life....just look at today's headlines of yuppie corporate CEO's looting the cash till to live the live of a king. Look at Britney marrying who she married.

81,basildave,This film is a guilty pleasure.,9,25 September 2004,"If this film came out today with Hillary Duff and the other modern brat packers I would probably take a big pass. One of the good things about this movie is that it was made during a time when political correctness was still in its' infancy and therefore you can have a character like Billy who is a missing father who runs out on his wife and kid but is still likable. Or a character like Jules who is a functioning alcoholic and impulsive liar. If the film came out today it would be a cautionary tale with them all ending up in therapy.The characters in this film are a bit clichéd and two dimensional but I do identify with some of them. Especially Kevin, who pines away for a girl who is seriously dating someone who he knows is screwing around on her. I can't tell you how many times I was in the same or similar position where a girl that I was crazy about was dating a friend of mine who was a complete jerk.Most embarrassing of all, I use this film as comfort food.

Although in hindsight this movie really isn't the best movie, I gave it a ten because at one time I could really relate to the characters sense of trying to redefine who they are. Demi Moore was definitely one of the weaker performances and you want to reach into the screen and smack her around for being such a half-wit snob.  The rest of the cast did a really good job.  The music from this movie is phenomenal.  I think the reason I love this movie despite all its flaws is it makes me put my life in perspective and think about the friends and decisions I have made.  Everytime I hear the love theme I can't help but feel sentimental. So all in all I gave it a hesitant 10 not for the performances, script or direction. I gave it a 10 because it hits home.",St. Elmo's Fire

That's all I have to say about this 80's movie about twenty-somethings struggling through their first years in the adult world. This is who we were. We didn't have social media, we didn't have therapists, and if we asked our parents for help, we got a lecture about learning to stand on our own two feet. So yeah, by today's standards, it doesn't play that well - in particular, one character's pursuit of a woman who is just too nice to clearly tell him no comes off extremely stalker-ish to modern eyes. But it accurately portrays the messiness of life and relationships if you were alive at that time, and it's still a fun watch with great music. Demi Moore is just wonderful in this and so is Rob Lowe. They're hot messes, but such pretty hot messes!",St. Elmo's Fire

86,wkallao,The Breakfast Club - but worse,6,3 March 2018,"Going into this film, I expected something just as witty, engaging and entertaining at the Breakfast Club, which nearly all the leading actors and actresses starred in. However, after watching this film, I was left feeling completely empty and a bit strange.While this film has its flaws, it has many things that help it shine. We have realistic stories with real, fleshed out characters. We understand these characters' motives and what drives them. We can relate to the core messages of most of their plots which help us empathize with them.However, this movie is like a sitcom without and punchlines. There is this aura of that this should have been a television series. This film sets up the story so well, but about half way through, it all falls a part. Everything ends up being wrapped into a nice little bow and everything seems to be perfect again. The struggles our characters face don't seem to really matter, because a big bandaid is placed over everything. The climax of the film is a huge letdown, with no major event really pushing the characters.Emilo Estevez probably has the best storyline of the film, with Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy coming in on a close second. Demi Moore's story line is a very strong one, but ends up falling apart with no real resolution. Everything else the characters go through doesn't seem to really matter. While we do become invested in the stories, they are shallow and lackluster.Overall, it is a good film and it's great to see these actors work so well together. However, the back half of the film falling apart severely prevents this movie from standing up as tall as it should be able to.",St. Elmo's Fire
87,Suzie True,"Excellent comic dialogue, great performances",9,13 August 2003,"The first time I saw this film was August 13, 2003. This was a surprisingly wonderful film that was impressively shot, lit, acted and written. I don't know why so many people have a problem with this film. Each character has complexity and flaws. None of them are cookie-cutter likeable. You have to almost struggle to like them, but relate, you do. Feel for them, you do.This is a film about dreams and reality, being lost in the freedom of post-graduate existence. It pulls the viewer in many directions but brings the story home in the end.Mature, immature, hilarious, heart-breaking, redeeming. 9/10 stars",St. Elmo's Fire

89,MovieLoverToo,Excellent Film,9,8 June 2015,I had seen bits and pieces of this movie over the years and had heard about it but never really seen the whole movie. Also I don't think I really understood it fully in the 80s being so young.Seeing it recently now that Im an adult I fully grasp the realities of life it was portraying in the 80s. The characters are so finely tuned and precise it looks as though they had a lot of time to rehearse and discuss their roles together as a cast. This is really rare in film production where some actors come together on day 1 and start shooting. Nevertheless it is a beautiful coherent and concise cast all performing as one.The story is very well crafted and precise as well. The result is a great film with intense and real emotions that are fresh and striking. I fell completely into their world in the 80s.The movie is a real Icon of its time and real artistic expression of life and survival in the world in the 80s.,St. Elmo's Fire

92,s.g.miles,A gear change in life that is too often over looked,7,23 May 2018,"I enjoyed this movie when it was released I enjoy it even more now for different reasons. In my teens it was fascinating and focused on decisions I would be making in a few years. In my 40s there's a poignant melancholy as I remember very similar situations faced by my own group of hometown friends. 
All of the individual components of the film are solid with my only negative criticism being the slightly overblown intensity of some of the relationships. It's all very much a 6 out of 10 experience, but what elevates to a 7 for me is one particular scene that still resonates powerfully...
In the film the characters have a regular table at their favourite bar. The last scene of the movie sees them standing outside the bar looking at a younger crowd at 'their' table. The characters linger for only a moment as they explain they each have various reasons for not going for a beer. I had exactly this experience the week before I left home to work overseas and start my career. This scene punches me hard, I miss those days and 'our' table in that bar",St. Elmo's Fire
93,Hypercampe,A movie about growing up,7,20 October 2011,"This movie is somewhat like its soundtrack's main theme, after a short while you understand what it is about. However, the melody's catchy and it will stay in your head for a while. The story is about a group of adults in their early 20s who all have to, each in their own way, learn how to live. The amusing thing with the film is that it relies solely on stereotypical characters: the hottie who's more vulnerable than she wants to show (Demi Moore), the controlling, ambitious and self-centered businessman, the girls guy, the self-pitying poet, etc...The acting is excellent, albeit overly-theatrical at times. I liked Rob Lowe's character in particular, thought it had a natural charm. For those of you who cannot stand Emilio Esteve, do not worry, his role is secondary. To sum it up, I found this film to be light, positive and yet handing out some food for thought. Only draw-back is the stereotypes used to make the point and the pedagogical side given to the story.",St. Elmo's Fire
94,rolinmoe,You can't go home again...,10,3 December 2002,"There are some problematic points in St. Elmo's Fire...a feminist critique of the film would discover some interesting facts about the desires of the three girls versus those of the four boys...and Rob Lowe's saving of Demi Moore's character could be the worst moment from the Brat Packers.  But even the greatest films have sore spots, and I don't think it's too far a stretch to call St. Elmo's Fire a great film.From the moment that the kids walk into the Hospital, full of vigor and importance, spouting off inside jokes, barking orders, and feeling righteous, we see how close-knit a group this is, and it makes their inevitable distancing from each other that much tougher to swallow in the end.  Because, fact is, these characters are easy to fall in love with. Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson both following their dreams, and both selling out in order to get them (and their respective employments aren't their only dreams), Allie Sheedy and Mare Winningham trying to find understanding for why they exist, and Rob Lowe's shown inability to grow up, even though he arguably leads the most adult life of the seven...life can't stay as care-free as it was when they are Alpha Omegas, no matter how hard they want it to.The dialogue is trite, and much is unbelievable, but it is the small things that Joel Shumacher does that make this great...the placard on their table that says RESERVED, Rob Lowe's wearing of his letter jacket when life gets tough, Mare Winningham's moral center versus the other heroine's carelessness, and the forced fun that many have together that culminates in the fight at the mansion.",St. Elmo's Fire

It really is a movie that can appear to people of all age groups on some level of underlying meaning. I saw it the first time, and re-watched it amazed at all of the small details that I had missed.

I was two months out of undergrad school, in a strange town on a new job in a brand new professional career. I went to see it by myself, and during that time the Brat Pack jumped off the screen to connect with me in a way that few movies do. This warm and deeply sympathetic treatment of changes in a young person's life is Hollywood come to life in rare form.Say what you will about the eighties; I say St. Elmo's is about life, and it's basic concept is timeless. This is a masterful movie, masterfuly crafted by a Director and cast of brilliant artists. Not to mention the soundtrack...I still get goosebumps when I hear ""Man In Motion"", even back-to-back on my CD player with ""Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in D minor"". Hey, find what you like and stick with it!  Call it what you will, but it works, for a lot of people!

It has possibly the most smoking scenes in the history of movies. Almost every character smokes in every scene, no matter where they are... a hospital, work, etc. The only time they stop smoking is when they stop to drink, and stalk.It is interesting to see how Demi Moore and Rob Lowe started out, since they're still quite successful (and in the case of Demi the producer, rich).Despite sub-par acting and all those cigs, it still gets a 6 because it's got some great lines.",St. Elmo's Fire

Worst of all, it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20-something dating, even as it purports to celebrate people ""finding themselves"".  The nice guys finish last, the jerky guys make out great, the jerkiest guys do best.  The girls are all boy toy pushovers.  Only one character (""Wendy"") is seen doing anything remotely useful to society, and she dispenses with her long-saved virginity in a throwaway one-night stand with a scumbag, in a lushly filmed scene that we're supposed to think is romantic.

But hey -- whatever. Everything comes and goes, and maybe I'm already a dinosaur, well before my time.But what I said is true.

They were: (1) Georgetown students smoke like chimneys; (2) Ally Sheedy must have ticked off the hair stylist because while the other stars had trendy 80's hair, Ms. Sheedy was forced to don a really bad 70's cut; and (3) apparently prior to the Rebecca Shaeffer murder, you could have a lovable stalker character named ""Kirby"" in a movie.Besides educational, this movie is a good way to waste a couple of hours. Just a great guilty pleasure, soapy, sudsy mess of hyped up 80's. While Hollywood thought these actors were the best and brightest of the decade, the real stars were going their own path on the small screen (think Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, Johnny Depp). As usual, Hollywood was wrong...but the brat pack sure was pretty to look at.",St. Elmo's Fire
101,judochop_,Our early life is a series of plateaus,6,25 October 2020,"From director Joel Schumacher - ""Adulthood is a state that you are constantly defining for yourself as you go along, hoping that an 'adult' is what other people will see. In 'St. Elmo's Fire' we wanted to dramatize the passion and uncertainty of that time. We also wanted to make a point about self-created drama: When most of us look back on our twenties, we see that a lot of the incredible drama we went through was self-created. I hope that older people will be reminded of what they went through and younger people will see something of themselves and their own lives. Each of the friends faces decisions that will determine his or her future"".",St. Elmo's Fire
102,brunhilda_zim,Chaotic!,1,12 March 2001,I did not enjoy this movie. It was too many plot lines and too much to handle.  There were 7 people with seven different stories to keep track of. It was so scattered you wonder why these people became friends in the first place.  I'll go even farther than that and say why were these people put on the earth in the first place.  There was no-one to like and i found none of the characters sympathetic.  The Breakfast Club was 100 times better than this.,St. Elmo's Fire

St. Elmos Fire probably has the most brat packers per capita than any other movie ever made and let me tell you, it's not the worse for it.Rob Lowe's mullet and single earring sent SHOCKWAVES down the vertebrate of American culture. Damn that was a cool look. Mullet and single earring....damn. Oh, and when Emilio Estevez says ""Later Dude"" to Andie MacDowells boyfriend?? Cool!! And hey Ally Sheedy, Alan Thicke called and wants his hair back from ""Whos the Boss"". Demi Moore?? Does she ever age?? Andrew McCarthy?? Classy!! But let me just say that if your name is Judd Nelson and the movie ISN'T The Breakfast Club then I'm not interested.And Rob Lowe's BLISTERING sax solo?? Well I'll just let that speak for itself.",St. Elmo's Fire

Now me only a young adult now you probably don't think that I should be able to give my two-sence on a movie that was made before I could write, but I don't see it that way.I should have been the age I am now back then(in the 80's)I probably know more about the 80's then my parents do...!!!...So, this movie showed me the 80's through the eyes of seven best friends that had resently graduated from collage and aren't which road to follow next!?! It took me into the lives of seven very unique individuals for a few hours. Now u might think I'm wierd or reading too much into a simple movie, but isn't what a writer is soposed to do!?! Well, the movie shows you that you shouldn't let temptations take u over, because you never know what you'll loose! Now, in this movie everyone lost and gained something, but it's a movie and thats how it was writen, in reality you'll probably loose a lot more...Think about that, if you haven't already and watch the movie (again) if you don't under stand.(there's a lot of temptation's in this movie)...It's just a suggestion...",St. Elmo's Fire
107,pit95pdt,Shallow and Pointless,2,28 July 2007,"The only redeeming character in this movie was the soundtrack. Every human character was self consumed and petty. There was no plot direction, and nothing was accomplished. In the end, their lives were just as shallow and pointless as in the beginning.I only watched it as a favor to my wife who said it was great, but she also thinks Jimmy Carter was a great president. I should had followed my instincts since 1985 and not waisted my time.Perhaps if the characters grew somewhat and learned from their mistakes I would have at least seen some value in it; but to no avail they continued to be the petty and worthless individuals that contribute nothing to society.",St. Elmo's Fire

Only people who don't understand the futility of life will not comprehend nor appreciate its artistic analysis of yuppies. Truly a brat pack relic, up there with the Breakfast Club! First, the ensemble sufficiently consist of a vast variety of characters with real issues. Life is certainly fleeting and the fresh graduates attempt to prove else-wise. Second, who cannot help but fall in love with that music score that richly encompasses DC in the fall. Lastly, I love it because it stars the brat pack though at their twilight still keeps the audience attracted performances. Hey, I was a little kid when it came out and I looked up to them.",St. Elmo's Fire

Emilio esteves' character was too needy and too boring. Judd nelson's character was just plain boring. demi moore was also a strong fun character that by the end of the movie had a lot of depth upon her. if you like the brat pack then yes you should watch this movie. but if u just want to watch a movie over the weekend, then do not get this movie",St. Elmo's Fire

113,lucasrocks,The greatest 1980's feature film ever made (aside from Grease 2 and Teen Wolf Too),10,19 May 2005,"This movie is beautiful, almost cried at it wonderful story and characters and dialog and setting and music and camera techniques and skillful lighting and of course Demi Moore. This may seem like a trash younger version of The Big Chill, but it's more trashy than that and it's all the better for it. I love the fact that the word yes is spoken in the movie and that upon reflection it contrasts the word no which is also spoken in this film. If you watch this movie you will be amazed by it's truthfulness and Demi Moore. She is certainly a fine lady and Bruce should not have given her up and allowed that little runt Ashton to ruin her career. Also Rob Lowe may excite heterosexual females and homosexual males with his animal magnetism and mullet. A film featuring both Demi and Rob is About Last Night is not as good in many respects but contains more sexual intercourse than St. Elmo's Fire. A side note - Demi is french for half. All other actors and actresses in this film are overshadowed by Demi and her powerful voice and big hair. If you liked movies such as Shrek and Latter Days than you have a wide and wonderful taste in films.St. Elmo's Fire is a movie worth having children for so you can show it to them. They should watch it on their third birthday, as this is the film's target audience. If you don't have a child find one on the street, there are many.St. Elmo's Fire the greatest film to feature Demi and Rob with no sexual intercourse.",St. Elmo's Fire

I thought I had it all figured out, and was met with a series of fails time and time again. It wasn't pretty, and neither was these peoples lives post grad and post not fun childhoods. Yeah some of us had parents who bought us cars and paid the rent sometimes, but do we need bleed? The criticism aimed at this movie that these people were shallow because they have money.....IS A SHALLOW CRITIQUE. Simply because having money or not having it has nothing to do with the person you become. If anything it could exacerbate problems. A cringe inducing movie but fun. The music is terrible!

I was surprised to find he wasn't behind it, but is is the sort of thing he was making at the time, and none the worse for that.With a little perspective (The Atlantic Ocean) it all seems a little self-absorbed but the themes are familiar to anyone going through the educational mill of a Western-style democracy and coming out the other side realising you're still not actually qualified to do anything.Finding your niche in life is tough, even if you've just graduated from Georgetown University, which I suspect in real life is a top school, like Oxford or Cambridge are here in the UK.The slushy plot is rescued by sharp dialogue which, while a little too witty and knowing, is entertaining all the same.The film's stars feature in several of my top ten 80s films. In fact, I'm looking forward to seeing Rob Lowe in A Few Good Men in London in a couple of weeks. How sad is that?!If this pops up on a TV station near you, give it a go. I loved it when it came out, and while the fanaticism has faded, I still have a place for it in my heart. It strikes a chord with my life at the time (I graduated in the 1980s too) and watch it from time to time, even though it's now a £5.99 bargain bin DVD here!",St. Elmo's Fire
116,lilmissd,Get The Hook!,3,17 December 2008,"This movie begins with 7 friends who have just graduated from college and have to go out into the real world and live. Except no one told them how things are in the real world, so instead of being responsible, caring, and intelligent adults; they act like spoiled, entitled, & selfish children! All the characters in this movie have major issues; we have Billy a womanizing jerk who's married but can't hack the responsibility of marriage or a child, Alec- a philandering political type who thinks that if he marries his girlfriend that it will make him faithful, Wendy-the rich girl who's virginity is given away to Billy a guy who will never appreciate it and doesn't deserve it, Kevin-the cynical newspaper writer who's totally in love with his best friend's girl, Kirby-the boring lawyer type who's not even interesting enough to catch the attention of a pretty doctor, Jules-the fast living coke-head who spends the whole movie acting like she's someone she's really not; and her unhappiness and self-loathing at being unloved by her father is exaserbated by her cocaine use. & Leslie who doesn't know what she wants because she's too busy with her career, and has feelings for another guy besides her boyfriend. Despite it's popularity I think it could have been a lot better, especially if Joel Schumacher would have had the characters actually LEARN their lives lessons instead of just muddling through. When Jules has her breakdown at the end of the movie and she says ""Who would have thought I would be this tired at 22"". What the hell is she on? At 22, you haven't even lived yet or experienced most of life's lessons that you will encounter in your life. Thank god that I am past that 20's decade part of life where your still trying to ""find"" yourself! Your left with a lot of disgust at the end because these characters are young, dumb and don't have a clue!",St. Elmo's Fire
117,laura_456789,St Elmos Fire made me feel normal,8,9 August 2011,"Here is a movie that probably won't be to everyone's liking but it most certainly was to mine. I am around the same age as the characters in this movie and each of them made me feel like I wasn't a giant ""loser"" for not having my life figured out at the young age of 23. When I was a kid I always thought by 20-25 I would have a family and have my life figured out and have a career that I love and a house of my own. I have none of these things. I blame this belief on the fact that our mothers were married and raising a family shortly after high school graduation. I suppose life just underwhelms you sometimes. The movie shows that all these characters appear to have their life together but behind closed doors they are all on the verge of breaking. You have the pretty girl who gets by on her looks for a while and then starts to hate herself for it. The ""ugly"" girl who likes the hot rebel but he just uses her and she lets him. The lonely writer who loves his friends girlfriend but swallows his pride because it's the right thing to do. And finally the couple who appear to be perfect to the rest of their friends but are indeed doomed. You can relate to all these people and seeing that they are going through many of the same bumps in the road as me brought me comfort. And of course it being a brat pack 80s movie didn't hurt either!",St. Elmo's Fire

And we found St.Elmo's Fire, she screamed because she saw Rob Lowe on the cover. We bought the DVD, and brought it back to watch it. We thought it was the best movie ever. It was Rob Lowe's hottest performance in my opinion, but anyways the others were good actors too. One of the better Brat Pack movies, even though the Breakfast Club is good it doesn't have Rob Lowe in it. And my friend would agree that is a requirement for a HOTT 80's movie, even though some of the others are hott too. No one can match up to Rob Lowe.",St. Elmo's Fire

I felt then as I do now (and I have given it a real chance over the years) that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Other than Mare Winningham and Andie McDowell (yeah, just a model, but very good in this part), it was ridiculous. Mare Winningham was already an established actress at this point and proved herself yet again. The Rob Lowe and Demi Moore angst just put this in a category by itself. Their relationship was not at all believable. Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy were marginal and Andrew McCarthy was, well, Andrew McCarthy. If someone saw this and was moved by it (positively), please fill me in. What was I missing?",St. Elmo's Fire
120,dharper-36694,The Soundtrack Brought Me Here,5,27 November 2018,"So this weekend on 80s on 8 they were playing this week in 1985 and apparently The St Elmos Fire soundtrack had a lot of top songs on it. I was 15 at the time and I remember buying the cassette, but never watched the movie. I loved all the Brat pack movies, but after watching this I now remember why. I dont want to give out any spoilers, but what kind of friends were these people. If my friend buried my head in a nasty toilet I guarantee you we would not ne sharing a beer 5 mins later. Plus Emilio I live ya,but were you not creepily obsessive..almost psychotic? No woman would ever be that excepting of this behavior. Demi..again way too much overacting. Thank God you made up for it in ""About Last Night"".Judd was Judd. Why did Rob Lowe have to leave and why didn't he choose a hotter woman? Something tells me Molly Ringwald was supposed to be here and I bet Anthony Hall was supposed to be Kevin. That being said Kevin was the most realistic character.Also so much smoking oh my.

121,typecase,I had to turn it off,1,14 July 2007,"I don't know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it. Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about. Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline. Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner. Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song. Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s. Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole. Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out. I don't know what it was that made me hate it so, but if it means trying to watch it again I'm not willing to find out.",St. Elmo's Fire
122,marmalade_sunrise,Perhaps One Must Be of a Certain Age....,8,7 September 2007,"Perhaps one must be of a certain age to truly appreciate this film. The ""self-absorbed"" comments seem to spring, in my mind, from older (middle-aged or elderly) viewers, or maybe just from grad students who are frightened that their prof may be reading their dissertation on this film.In my experience as a 30 year old woman, most young people who are in their twenties are self-absorbed. I think it's a natural and necessary part of thriving in the current United States' culture. I saw this movie in my late teens, and it made a tremendous emotional impact on me. I did not see the characters as shallow, superficial, or selfish, but just as regular people like myself and my friends.Even now that I have left my twenties, I can go back and still appreciate St. Elmo's Fire; not just for the 80's nostalgia (though that is a big draw, I must admit) but because I perceive the characters as living stories that I can identify with in parts. Especially as a slightly more mature adult, I can look back and say, ""Yeah, I remember going through that."" or ""I knew someone like that five years ago."" St. Elmo's Fire will always have a place in my heart for what it represents to my generation, and to the generation that actually came of age during the film's premiere. Maybe one had to grow up in the 80's - whether in childhood or adolescence - to enjoy St. Elmo's Fire.Okay. So it's not timeless. Who cares? There are some great scenes in this flick and it's a fun watch, even though it always makes me cry.",St. Elmo's Fire
123,panther-dash,Love to Hate,7,14 November 2006,"When the friends go down to St Elmo's bar to see Rob Lowe play, Demi Moore describes his performance as ""unbelivable"", well, I wonder if that remark was scripted or ad-libbed, either way she hit the nail on the head.. and why did he stick his chest out so much? He looked like a little pigeon strutting the stage.For such an uncontroversial film St Elmo's really stirs up strong feelings and I understand why, people who were of similar age when the film came out are filled with nostalgia; those autumnal hues that clever, faintly classical/preppy/sentimental/plinkplonk-piano musical motif always gets me (forget the awful John Parr nonsense).It pushes all the right buttons on one level.On another level we're asked to live vicariously, for 2 hours, through the lives of the most smug little collective ever to appear in a movie!! The film ""Diner"" with Mickey Rourke was about self obsessed graduates but this film had charm and insight, St Elmo's gloried in the Yuppie dream and the vile selfishness that surrounded that nasty time. Andrew Mcarthey was a wet Morrissey, The blonde virgin (up the duff at the time) played the part so well she bored me to tears, Emilo Estavez? What film did he turn up for because to say his part was extraneous would be surplus to requirements.The actors I loved, the characters I loved to hate but was meant to love and that was the problem-they said nothing to me about my life at the time but now over 20 years later I can share fond memories with types I'd cross the road in order to avoid because we all grow up-hopefully.",St. Elmo's Fire

You need to lighten up.I watched the DVD of this the other day with the directors commentary, the budget to make it was low, yet the final result is quite special.There are some great performances in this movie, particularly McCarthy and Lowe, legends.I rate St Elmo's Fire higher than Breakfast Club simply because more happens and the characters are more structured.If you have never seen this movie, I suggest you do, it may not mirror reality these days, but there's a certain magic to this film.",St. Elmo's Fire

The characters are THAT believable. To Be honest, during the end when Billy left, i started to tear up...On the downside, because there were so many characters i felt like some of the characters were undeveloped. I have to say that my favorite character was Kirby. The fact that he could couldn't get the love of his life was depressing :( Ohh, and Judd Nelson's character bugged the crap out of me.

You could arguable say it's about the changes in life that cause changes in friendships etc., but especially in the beginning there are a lot of scene changes that don't seem to go anywhere. Plus, it's just weird. The men are all weird, and I do not get the strange Emilio obsession with Andie McDowell, or why she keeps letting him in houses when he's acting like a psycho. I suppose this movie is supposed to be endearing in some way, but it's pretty depressing. In the end, all it's about is shallow, empty sex lives. Leave it to the 80's.",St. Elmo's Fire

No, they are not necessarily likable; however, they are relatively interesting to follow. Think Election. And the things they go through are quite easy to recognize. Life after high school, love vs. obsession, relationship issues and dealing with various problems that young people face are dealt with, and it comes across pretty convincing and genuine. It can be funny here and there, when it goes for it, a little of that being black comedy. This is fairly engaging, and there is some tension. There are a few stereotypes in this, such as the presentation of a gay man; meanwhile, when you look at how the straight people in this are, it would have stood out more(as Joel points out in the informative and amusing director's commentary on the DVD; it also comes with theatrical trailers for About Last Night and Mortal Thoughts) if it had been toned down. There's the prostitute and the Jews, as well, I suppose. The acting tends to be spot-on. There is a bit of sexuality(not graphic, only brief nudity) and strong language in this.",St. Elmo's Fire

Trying to make your mark, falling in love with the wrong people, and being there for your friends. It's about how hard it is to find yourself after college, without losing all of your friends. If you grew up in the 80's this movie is part of our youth. It was also a great launching pad for some of our greatest stars, including Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Andie McDowell, Mare Winningham, and Ally Sheedy. Also,during filming of the movie, Demi Moore entered rehab and has been sober since.

I first saw it when I was 17, just after I'd left high school, so I guess that's one of the reasons I related so well to it. Others that I know who have seen it, just don't get into it, probably because they were in an age bracket either side when they saw it.  All the characters are vulnerable, in one way or another, and all are stronger, and I guess, better people too by the end of the movie.

St. Elmo`s Fire didn`t fail to live up to my expectations, a great teen flick which hasn`t lost it`s appeal even now (although the hair styles have). When people ask me what this film is about its very difficult to explain, and the best way I`ve come to describe it is 'Friends' in the 80`s but more serious.

In some instances, individuals find it difficult to contemplate the ""real world"" and all that it offers; case in point Rob Lowe's character, and to a certain degree Demi Moore's. Of course, the infatuation of Emilo Estevez' character was interestingly portrayed. I remember when this movie came out, I was still in University, and the group of seven were referred to THE RAT PACK (reference to the RAT PACK of Frank, Dean, Sammy, Peter, Joey and Shirley), but unfortunately, this was the only grouping of the seven actors; although, there were other movies made with two or three of the actors: ALL ABOUT LAST NIGHT (Demi & Rob), BREAKFAST CLUB (Emilo, Ally & Judd) to name just two. Actually, just for the fun of seeing all the cast again, it would be interesting to do a ST.ELMO'S FIRE: THE RENUNION, and see how 20years may have played a positive part in each character's growth to maturity...Does Demi's character become a TV Talk-show Host, similar to Oprah? Does Judd's character become a Senator or even further, President of the USA? Does Andrew and Ally's character marry? Or do Judd and Ally's character marry and have kids? And what about Rob, Mare, Emilo? Does Rob's character become the success, we all know he has the talent for and comes back to marry Mare? Does Emilo drop out of Medical School, pursuing his Law Career becoming one of the top lawyers in his field and comes back to marry Andie's character? And what about that mostly everyone either stays in contact over the 20years period or have drifted apart and come together over a special weekend reunion after one of the characters' is faced with a serious situation or major tragedy which brings all together? Interesting questions...anyone out there in Hollywood listening????",St. Elmo's Fire
138,schulzejennifer-29585,Stalker Kirby???,6,18 September 2020,"I'm writing this review because this film is very unrelatable. The main character in particular is Kirby (Emilio Estevez) who's obsession with Andie (the doctor) turns into stalking and predatory situation. Even for a movie that may or may not aged well. I can't imagine watching this film in 1985 thinking this behavior was normal. There is one scene he shows up at the Doctor's house and then starts smelling her pillow and the roommate saw this, she was mortified (and so was I).I wrote this review just for this character. I can't believe this behavior was normalized!!!",St. Elmo's Fire
139,jenmills276,A coming of age classic - I still love this movie!,8,15 February 2007,"I think most people over the age of 25 can relate to this movie. It is the traditional ""Where am I going, what am I doing, and how in the world did I get here"" story. Seven newbie graduates all connected yet torn apart by love and friendship - all trying to reach for the future yet hold onto the past.Just as a note -I know some may comment on the poor morality of the characters, however, I truly believe these characters give an accurate representation of the confusion and fear most young adults face when they first enter the world on their own and how the excitement of life and freedom can cause a person to make poor decisions in the heat of the moment.",St. Elmo's Fire
140,DiscoStu2,The Worst of the '80's - Makes You Wish You'd Hadn't Been There,1,27 December 2014,"Unfortunately this was a movie made for my generation, and unlike a fine wine which may get better with age, this was more like an old can of ""New Coke"" that has only degraded even further with time. After having sat through the torturous experience in 1985 and paying for the original privilege of watching this abomination back in the good old days, I thought I would revisit it in the year of our lord 2014 to see if time and experience had sharpened my insight and appreciation of this pretentious stink bomb. Sorry but the answer is now as it was then ""no"". It was painfully, self-absorbed tripe then and is even more difficult to watch now. Kind of like your friend reminding you years later about how you made a schmuck of yourself at a party years ago. Forget about explaining the plot, it's virtually non-existent and more or less just contrived motifs to showcase forced bad acting and interactions that are supposed to be meaningful and poignant but are really just forced shallow overacting. Previous generations had Bogart, Brando, Dean, Newman, and McQueen. Sadly my generation had...these people. In all fairness the blame can't be laid entirely at the feet of this group of too much stardom, too soon brat packers; most of them were still in their early twenties and to give them the benefit of the doubt, may have still been learning their craft even though they were being paid handsomely for the lessons. Much of the blame should probably also go to the two writers and the director; two of whom were Joel Schumacher. The intention here appears to mostly have been about exploiting these seven young rising stars in a bad forced combination similar to watching a terrible 80's musical super group. Bad musical synth pop overlays, also very 80's, filling the scenes out also didn't help. Do real people really behave in such shallow, self-indulgent, and boring histrionics? No, not really. If you've ever gone to Times Square NYC and stood next to a cardboard cutout of a celebrity, then you get the gist of this ensemble of predictable now very dated 80's stereotypes; the hypocritical career climber politico (Judd Nelson), the self-destructive, emotionally vacant, druggie (both Lowe and Moore), the overage, good girl, virgin (something out of the '40's), and on and on. If buckets of forced crying, laughing, pathos, yelling, etc., but nothing emotionally substantial for the viewer to identify with in any real way is your cup of tea then this may be your type of film. Believe it or not at the time I worked with a guy who loved this movie. I couldn't even muster a comeback to that statement beyond ""Really?!!"". Whenever I may get nostalgic for the 80's I need only channel this movie to cure myself of that. Hard to watch in the original, almost painfully masochistic to watch now. Glad to see that many of these people, including Joel Schumacher, went on to do much better work than this, but hey, the studio was paying and the rest was on the house.",St. Elmo's Fire
141,luciadmedici,A fantastic brat pack movie!,10,13 June 2011,"I'm getting sick of all the reviews that tell us that it's a stupid film full of self absorbed people and yadiyadiyah. It's sort of the point of the movie. Next to that is the perfect character the most boring character ever. A Mary Sue is no fun; no wonder that bad guys are popular. I personally think it's an excellent film. Judd Nelson's performance was great; even though Alec was a complete prick, I couldn't help but like him anyway. I liked the character of Kevin, until he got some confidence; the miserable him, who loved Ally Sheedy from a distance, was more interesting, but well.. A character needs development, otherwise it's still no fun. I liked how Emilio Estevez had his own little story line. It was pretty cute really, his utter clumsy admiration, but it felt like he wasn't so much part of the group, because there was too little interaction between him and the others.But in the end, everything came to an end in a very satisfying kind of ending.(ps: I'm not a native English speaker - so forgive my mistakes)Oh the funniest part I think was that Demi Moore thought Kevin was gay and in love with Alec. I was almost disappointed when he wasn't",St. Elmo's Fire
142,Boofy1,This movie deserves some praise...,9,16 July 2004,"When I saw that this film only had one comment, and a fairly negative one, I just had to say something.I saw this movie when it first came out, and I was in my early teens. I thought it was great then, and to this day it is still one of my favorite films.For me it went beyond being entertained by a great cast, but showed how difficult it can be to make the transition from school to the ""real"" world. In a time of ""money for nothing"" and ""material world"", this movie showed that no matter how much you want to believe the world revolves around you and your little group, reality tends to set in sooner or later and it isn't always as cool and glamorous as you want it to be.Awesome cast, well acted, and a great story....one of the best films of the 80's!!!",St. Elmo's Fire
143,barbara92341,St. Elmo's Fire,8,22 September 2013,"A good movie has interesting characters and GREAT Music. This movie had both. This was also the age of my Daughter's era. It gave me great insight as to how different things were from my teenage years in the 50's and 60's. Some of these characters were ones we would like for friends and others we would hope not to have in our life. It tells us there is NO Cinderella story happy ending but just a continuation of growth. Experience does not always make us wise. It can make us bitter and hostile. Our choice of friends sometimes reflect who we want to be. Sometimes our Ego reflects our own self-loathing. All in all, without dissecting it completely, I enjoyed it very much for about the third or fourth time I have watched it. It is ironic that now the ones from the late 70's and early 80's are Parents (and maybe grandparents). A good movie to watch no matter the decade you belong to. I enjoyed watching it recently with MY Daughter and Granddaughter, who is 23 years old. They were both amused that I have a problem with the profanity and the sex scenes. I still remember being eight years old when Mom took me to another of the ""Gone With the Wind"" re-showings and I was mortified that Rhett Butler actually said the word ""damn"". That was in the early 50's.",St. Elmo's Fire
144,lopez568,Pretentious rubbish.,1,21 August 2009,"St. Elmo's Fire has no bearing on life after university at all (for the majority of us common folk anyway). Why was this garbage even made? Who can really relate to this? Who lives like these characters? I truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script. There are some talented young actors in this ""film"" that have done a good job elsewhere. It must have just been one whole joke to them on set.I actually found this ""film"" insulting to my intelligence. The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol' laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released.Don't make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80's films. It really is that offensive to the genre.",St. Elmo's Fire

Now with some additions and subtractions the cast solidifies around the theme of having to adjust to life after college in the real world.The intertwining of career issues, family issues, and relationship issues combine to make what was simple in college much more complicated. Excellent performances by the whole cast demonstrated the talents they brought to the big screen. Combined with the great musical score, highlighted by John Pare's title song St. Elmos Fire, makes for a neatly packaged coming of age production.",St. Elmo's Fire
147,marlahumphreys,"So Bad, It's Good",5,4 January 2015,"This movie is hilarious, and it's not even a comedy!It follows 7 recent college grads, trying to transition into the real world. The caricatures... er, characters, are: Billy - the greasy musician who's finding that monogamy and fatherhood are not his thing. Alec - the aspiring politician who's finding monogamy to his fiancée is not his thing. Leslie - Alec's fiancée, who wants to establish a career before marriage. Wendy - the philanthropic virgin in granny duds. Kirby - the waiter pining for a fellow alumna. Kevin - the sensitive writer pining for Leslie. Jules - the ""Like A Virgin""-clad, coke-addled mess.How are these people even friends? What do Leslie and Billy have in common? Or Wendy and anyone else? The only interaction between ""Kirbo"" and Jules is his requesting her expertise on ordering fine wine to impress a date. More importantly, how did some of these idiots attend Georgetown?Joel Schumacher may be a fine director, but his dialogue for this age group is highly contrived. Some doozies:Billy - ""Let's Rock!"" Alec - ""Wasted love!"" Leslie & Wendy - "" Men... can't live with 'em; can't shoot 'em."" Kirby - ""Soon as I make it really big, I'm going Fluff-n-Fold."" Kevin - ""Love is an illusion."" Jules - ""You were always the couple most likely to couple, and don't you forget it!"" Group - ""Booga Booga Booga, Ah Ah Ahhh!""I've watched this movie many times since my teens (when it premiered), and I always laugh, cringe, facepalm, stare in wonderment at the screen as to how such nonsense was even filmed. The ridiculousness of Jules' breakdown near the end, by opening her windows to allow in some cold air, perfectly sums up this masterpiece. And then the cherry on top: after Billy's departure to hit it big in NYC, the gang decides to convene at Houlihan's the next day, because now they're grown-ups.",St. Elmo's Fire

150,Brain_Dropings,The Hard Goodbye,4,6 January 2008,"I bought St. Elmo's at a Best Buy for something about 5 dollars along with 9 other movies of which are all, in their own rights, classics and I bought it under the promise that it would be the closest thing there was to a Breakfast Club 2.Well, it is in the utter most regret that I tell you this is nothing but a dirty, dirty lie. Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire is not a landmark coming-of-age film as it was intended, but more of am inept attempt to portray life after college in a big city. Seven 20-something friends, each with a distinctive personality of their own, realize through the hard way that it isn't just about the parties, and the romance in a young couple, and the fun of hanging out...while hanging out in a local bar (sound familiar) but there is also the drama about finally acting like grown-ups.The reason this film fails to deliver is in it's wasted talent and awful direction, every single player is simply laid out, there's no depth, no sentiment just a few flashes now and then. The script is molded out for cold, cynical characters who take love and life very lightly. Granted, in real life there are people like that. You just aren't interested in them.10 minutes into the thing and I'm lost, so there's the party boy who has a wife and child, but yet dates and while dating, hits on a girl. A wise cracking guy, pessimist kind of guy who's secret love is all to predictable. A slutty brat and a girl who just doesn't seem to fit. The movie had me vouching for Ally Sheddy and Judd Nelson, there was some chemistry there, but even they didn't do a terrific job.I had faith in the movie, swearing it would do better after some time, but then it just goes on and on and on until the very last end were one scene, one line kind of makes up for the whole thing, but it was already too late. And I blame Schumacher, he was the one that ruined Batman, although I've never been a Rob Lowe fan and Andrew McCarthy, well let's just say I prefer Duckie over him.You see, this could've been a great movie. One you could look back at and realize how wonderful and significant it is after all this years (i.e. The Breakfast Club) but instead it became sort of a prologue to 'Friends' in contemplating the shitty and stupid side of all 20 year-olds who are frivolous and superficial. By the end of the movie I didn't jumped up and down in excitement, neither did I let my mind ran wild with all of it wondering why hadn't I seen this movie along time ago.I just sat there and thought, after all, that perhaps it would be better to just say goodbye to the Brat Pack and stick to the good things that they left behind, not this.",St. Elmo's Fire
