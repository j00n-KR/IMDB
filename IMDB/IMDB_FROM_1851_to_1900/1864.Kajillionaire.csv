0,SnoopyStyle,fascinating and infuriating,6,3 April 2021,"Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood) has been trained by her parents, Robert (Richard Jenkins) and Theresa (Debra Winger), to live a life of petty crimes and scams. While on a round to NYC to do an insurance scam, Robert and Theresa become taken with fellow passenger Melanie (Gina Rodriguez). They take her in as a part of the family and part of their criminal crew.I'm fascinated with this family up to the point of Melanie. I'm fascinated and also infuriated by ERW's performance as Old Dolio. She is so quiet and lacking in agency. Quite frankly, I'm in love with her choice for a voice. At some point, Melanie takes up space. That's not to say that Melanie isn't interesting. I have complicated feelings about this movie. Some of this unforgettable and fascinating while other parts are too frustrating.",Kajillionaire
1,boblipton,"Dull, Uninteresting Characters Wander About",4,26 December 2020,"A family of small-time scam artists wander about until the parents settle on a major heist, at which point the daughter begins to develop a sense of morality.... or perhaps feels that the risks are too great.It's an exercise in the anomie of outsiders, with all three of them in a constant state of low-key depression and apprehension. Richard Jenkins offers a mildly interesting portrayal of someone who seems to think everything is beneath him, with occasional excursions into paranoid conspiracy theories. The movie offers the sense that much of the dialogue -- monologues, actually -- are improvised to illustrate these are not very interesting people. With Evan Rachel Wood, Gina Rodriguez, and Debra Winger on board, I was expecting something more interesting, but it is shot uninterestingly, with no one to care about.",Kajillionaire
2,nogodnomasters,Ocean's Zero,2,18 October 2020,"Parents and their dysfunctional daughter (Evan Rachel Wood ) pull minor scams that appear to be more work than getting a job. They barely make ends meets as grifters and mudlarks. During a job they meet Gina Rodriguez who loved ""Ocean's 11"" and joins the group. The parents seem to like her more than their own daughter which makes things worse.Not sure what the whole point was of the film. Sure it was different, but so was ""Pink Flamingos"" and many folks didn't find it entertaining. It was slow and pathetic. I expected some twist or something different to happen in the dark, but it just never does.Guide: F-word. Film nudity.",Kajillionaire
3,kosmasp,Life on the shaky streets,8,7 June 2021,"What a great role for Rachel Evan Woods ... of course the supporting actors do their jobs. But it is sort of her role ... and her movie overall. I did not know what to expect and the family she is in, is quite the interesting oddity! And her performance ... just awesome! You can tell from the start.And it is not the easiest job. She has to walk quite the fine line. Her character is not really likeable! But she is quirky and weird ... and while she (but her parents even more so) does things that could be described as despicable ... we know it is her situation that motivates her. For that, she still seems to have a moral compass ... of sorts. Again very weird and crazy character.She will clash with a ""newcomer"", which we can predict ... and also were this will lead to ... still the drama is well played and well acted (no pun intended).",Kajillionaire
4,classicsoncall,"""We can only ever be how we are.""",4,16 April 2021,"What a pointless movie. I don't mind quirky, if in fact this is what it was trying to be, but eventually you have to get to some kind of resolution that connects the dots. I get a kick out of the DVD sleeve that calls it 'A giddy surprise' and Wonderfully unpredictable', written presumably by critics who couldn't be honest in describing it. I actually did feel sorry for Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood), who was kept sheltered by her parents and raised as a grifter and forced to split anything she scammed three ways with her father (Richard Jenkins) and mother. Couldn't believe the part of the mother Theresa was played by Debra Winger. I didn't recognize her as the same actress who portrayed Sissy in 1980's ""Urban Cowboy"", but then again, that was forty years ago. The 'adoption' of Melanie (Gina Rodriguez) as part of the wandering family was rather bizarre, with the parents paying more attention to her than their own daughter. That blackout scene when Old Dolio and Melanie got locked in a bathroom was just the strangest thing, with Dolio believing the world was ending. In another picture the parents might have gotten hauled in for child abuse, but at twenty six years old, if Old Dolio hadn't figured out she was part of a dysfunctional family, I don't know when she would have.",Kajillionaire
5,CinemaSerf,Ghastly story about ghastly people....,4,29 October 2020,"I have to admit that I really didn't like this film at all. The first few, quite quirky, scenes depict a family of grifters who make their living scamming and stealing from other folks' post office boxes, but when they meet a young woman on a plane and she concocts a plan to ""upgrade"" their antics and prey on the lonely and the housebound then the plot becomes cynical - indeed the entire thing is rather unpleasant. There is the germ of a romance between Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez, but that just appears a distraction to the whole, rather odious, thing that couldn't end quickly enough. It's a well enough made film, and the performances competent, but it's frankly just horrible to watch....",Kajillionaire
6,evanston_dad,Delightfully Weird,9,21 January 2021,"A delightfully weird movie directed by --- no surprises there! --- Miranda July.This is the kind of movie that could never succeed without actors who know how to play the material just right, so let's start with Richard Jenkins and the unrecognizable Debra Winger, shall we? Could these two be any better? They play a married couple (or at least a couple) who try to live off the grid but in the middle of Los Angeles, a tricky business. They have all sorts of conspiracies about how the government, big business, etc. is trying to mind control people, so they don't do things like shop in stores, have an online presence, bathe, things like that. Instead, they spend every waking moment coming up with cockamamie schemes to steal and rob whatever they can. They're raising their daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) in this environment, and things seem to be going ok, or as ok as such a situation could ever be, when the family dynamic is upset by the addition of a normal person from the actual world (Gina Rodriguez) who wakes Wood up to all the ways her parents have failed to show her love or even affection.If you are the kind of viewer who demands realism from your movies, this one will try your patience. There are at least a couple of events in this film (like what happens to Rodriguez's apartment, and those of you who've seen it know what I'm talking about) that not just strain credibility but try mighty hard to entirely break it. But the thing is, they don't. They feel credible within the world July creates in her movie, a world that's just a hair out of kilter with the world as we actually know it. And for me, everything worked.Well, almost everything. I didn't love the lesbian themes that become increasingly prominent as the movie progresses, not because I have a problem with lesbian themes in general, but rather because they didn't feel well integrated into this particular story. But the movie is about loving and being loved in return, and there are all kinds of love, so in the end that too mostly worked for me.Evan Rachel Wood is sensational, but this movie is stolen by, of all people, Gina Rodriguez. Who would ever have thought?One of 2020's standout movies.Grade: A",Kajillionaire
7,ferguson-6,wrapped presents,8,25 September 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. A single month with new releases from both Charlie Kaufman (I'M THINKING OF ENDING THINGS) and Miranda July, is almost enough to make this movie lover forget for a moment that we are suffering through a global pandemic, raging forest fires, and the most obscene presidential campaign of my lifetime. Ms. July is an absurdly talented writer and filmmaker, and it's her first feature length film since THE FUTURE (2011). Prior to that, she served up ME AND YOU AND EVERYONE WE KNOW (2005), and has a unique way of displaying her strange life observations. She and Kaufman are masters of quirk, and excel in twisting our minds.Evan Rachel Wood stars as Old Dolio Dyne, daughter of Robert (Richard Jenkins) and Theresa (an unrecognizable Debra Winger). This is an oddball family of petty crime con artists who live in a run down, unused office next to the Bubbles, Inc. factory. And yes, they make bubbles in the factory ... bubbles that seep through the walls into the office where this family sleeps. One of their scams is on the landlord (a surreal character himself) who has to explain to an always-negotiating Robert that ""rent is an installment"".The first part of the film allows us to get to know the family members. We see them pull off stealing mail from a neighboring post office box, and returning stolen goods for the reward. Ms. Wood stays attired in an oversized green track suit jacket, and has lowered her speaking voice by an octave, adding impact to her monotone liners. She's socially awkward, and likely on the spectrum as she seems to be the smartest of the bunch. Daddy Robert is a control freak and has an emotional disability in regards to California earthquake tremors. He and Theresa show no signs of affection towards each other or Old Dolio.An airline baggage scam results in the family meeting Melanie (Gina Rodriguez), an eager to join the grifters woman, whom Old Dolio sees as her replacement as both a daughter and partner. Jealousy ensues. Melanie is contrasted to Old Dolio by her bubbly personality, and by a wardrobe that is significantly more revealing than a tattered track suit. Old Dolio watches uneasily as Melanie is soon receiving the attention from Robert and Theresa that their own daughter craves.The second half evolves into a film not so much about cons or heists (the film admits it's no OCEANS 11), as about family dynamics. The twists and turns find Melanie helping Old Dolio break free of parental over-control in order to experience independence ... and pancakes. Learning about warmth and affection from ""normal"" families is eye-opening for her, and sometimes a little confusing for us to follow. Who is scamming whom, and when are they telling the truth?Miranda July has created a crime-drama-comedy (dark comedy), with plenty of space to let the characters and dialogue breathe. ""I'm Mr. Lonely"" by Bobby Vinton kicks in periodically, and the score from Emile Mosseri (THE LAST BLACK MAN IN SAN FRANCISCO) complements it well. On the heels of last year's team of family scamsters in PARASITE, this shaggy group has never met a swindle they wouldn't try. And they never expected it to backfire with their own daughter. The divide between those who like the film and those who don't was pretty clear after Sundance, and Miranda July will likely never be one to appeal to the masses. But for those of us who connect with her oddball way of seeing life, we appreciate the focus on what makes a family of outsiders click ... especially when a superb performance from Evan Rachel Wood drives the film.",Kajillionaire
8,deloudelouvain,Entertaining enough for me.,7,15 March 2021,"Don't bother with the negative reviews for this one on here. That is if you're not too picky and can enjoy a movie without the urge of being too critical all the time. Kajillionaire is certainly not a bad movie, it's different and sometimes a bit weird, but it's definitely entertaining. The plot is about a disfunctional (or not) family that tries to get by using inventive scams to gather some money. Nothing they will get rich of, just a bunch of lowlife scams that are funny to watch. The family is played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger (which I didn't recognize) and Evan Rachel Wood. The whole crew did a good job. Kajillionaire might not be an award winning movie but it's good enough for a good movie night.",Kajillionaire

It involves an older married couple Theresa(Debra Winger) and Robert(Richard Jenkins) who are con artists and that's their way of life as schemes earn them a buck! For years they have been a mentor toward their plain daughter Old Dolio(Evan Rachel Wood) as each day she sees stealing, and scams at every corner and turn. During a trip the family meets an attractive stranger that being Melaine(Gina Rodriguez) and as each warm up to one another the three have a new partner in crime.

10,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Kajillionaire (2020) 7.3/10,7,2 November 2020,"""Proud of subsisting with their entire existence through skimming and petty theft, Robert and Theresa indoctrinate Old Dolio with unorthodox ideas (totally disavowing capitalistic and consumerist impulses and obsessions) and treat her as a partner-in-crime rather than their daughter. Thus, Old Dolio is a kooky cookie, sporting a head of straight, long hair like her mother, she seems to be eternally at odds with her surroundings, there is always a question mark hanging aloft her lanky, stiff demeanor. She is physically tense since a phobia of human contact has gelled into a thick carapace. As Old Dolio, Wood finally finds a role so singularly different from previous ones and attempts a lower, more gravelly register, her expression also melds open-faced puzzlement with an air of infantile inscrutability, it is an affectation that befits the immanent awkwardness emanated from an out-and-out oddball.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Kajillionaire
11,MOscarbradley,Another Indie gem from July.,9,19 October 2021,"Miranda July's sublime, off-the-wall comedy stars an almost unrecognizable Debra Winger, (she's become the new Ruth Gordon), and Richard Jenkins as the world's seemingly two worst petty criminals, Evan Rachel Wood as their sullen, withdrawn daughter known only as Old Dolio and a superb Gina Rodriguez as the Puerto Rican girl they recruit or rather who recruits them.Being a Miranda July picture you know this won't conform to other movies about crime or criminals. It's very funny in an almost surreal fashion and its LGBT subplot fits perfectly into the scenario. It's also surprisingly touching and while it may not appeal to a multiplex crowd it's still a little gem that has cult movie written all over it.",Kajillionaire
12,Cineanalyst,Rom-Con,7,7 June 2021,"""Kajillionaire"" is a sweet film, perhaps because its characters seem unusual. It's funny and loving, but not a formulaic rom-com. It's not inauthentic in that way--not ""false, fakey,"" as Debra Winger's mother and wife character puts it at one point, nor out to become a ""kajillionaire,"" as the father and husband played by Richard Jenkins admonishes. One way that movies, naturally deceitful by their very nature as staged fictional stories, avoid that pitfall of dishonesty is to be reflexive: to admit the grift. One such genre, of which ""Kajillionaire"" is part, is the con-artist or heist film, which features actors alluding to the fact that they're actors playing characters by the characters they're playing being actors--con artists seeking marks, or an audience. It's such an abstraction that alerts Gina Rodriguez's character to be suspicious of what Jenkins and Winger are up to--asking them what they do for a living again after he enthusiastically warns her about pick pockets. It takes a thief to catch a thief, as the idiom goes.So, the job, then, is to discover the con, or lie, and what is the truth. In, say, an Ocean's heist flick this may tend to be straightforward with an explanation at the end as to how they pulled off the robbery. Here, it's a bit more tricky as it's about the characters, who they truly are and what they are to each other--even what life and death means to them. Are they acting or not. There are tremors throughout the plot opening fault lines into these supposed truths or exposing such lies and, then, the supposed big one hits. And, there's a third way, which the movie's protagonist daughter played by Evan Rachel Wood points out, to the sort of Schrödinger's cat experiment of the hidden money. Honor among thieves an' all that, to steal another common phrase. When one wants more than that, more than just pancakes, wrapped presents, dancing and such--when they want touch, human intimacy, well, that's where movies end.",Kajillionaire

15,paul-allaer,Original and quirky (to say the least),6,26 September 2020,"""Kajillionaire"" (2020 release; 106 min.) brings the story of the Dyne family: Robert, Theresa and their 20-something yr. old daughter Old Dolio. As the movie opens, we are at a Los Angeles US Postal Office and Old Dolio is stealing a package from the post office. Robert is delighted that it contains an expensive looking tie. The three of them then set their sights on their next scamming opportunity, with again Old Dolio having to do all of the work. Back at their apartment (a room that is part of the Bubbles, Inc. manufacturing company), their landlord is demanding payment on their lease, now 3 months overdue. Robert needs to come up with an even grander scamming plan, and quickly... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from indie writer-director Miranda July (""The Future""). Here she brings us an original and quirky look at a dysfunctional family that survives (?) by scamming left and right. ""Some people wanna be kajillionaires, I just want to skim"", says Robert. The early part of the movie focuses on their scamming ways, but soon you feel there is more at work, namely the stunted emotional development of the daughter (weirdly named Old Dolio). She doesn't have a notion of love or affection, and her universe is coming under attack altogether when Robert and Theresa welcome a stranger into their world. This film is billed as a comedy-drama, but that is really not reflective of this very indie and very off-center movie. Evan Rachel Wood is wonderful as Old Dolio (purposefully lowering her voice), and Richard Jenkins is his usual weird-yet-loveable. But the big surprise is the Theresa character. I almost fell out of my chair when the end titles started rolling and it is revealed that this role is played by none other than Debra Winger, yes, THE Debra Winger, utterly and completely unrecognizable. Wow, just wow.""Kajillionaire"" premiered to good buzz at this year's Sundance Film Festival. It now feels like January 2020 (hence, pre-coronavirus) might as well be a decade ago. After multiple delays, the film finally opened this weekend in select theaters, including at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, fully adhering to all COVID-19 protocols. Not that it mattered, as the Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended by exactly 3 people (including myself). All that aside, if you are in the mood for something original and quirky (to say the least), I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Kajillionaire
16,stevendbeard,Quirky Dark Comedy,5,27 September 2020,"I saw ""Kajillionaire"", starring Evan Rachel Wood-Westworld_tv, Across the Universe; Richard Jenkins-Kong:Skull Island, Step Brothers; Debra Winger-The Ranch_tv, Wonder Woman_tv and Gina Rodriguez-Deepwater Horizon, Jane the Virgin_tv.
This is a dark comedy that some people may like and others may not-I'm, sad to say, in the latter category. It has some good actors in it but the story was a little off-some might call quirky. Richard & Debra-you might not recognize her-are parents to Evan, and all 3 are con artists that are living from one con to another, just waiting for their big score to come in. The scammers even tell their landlord that they will pay their rent in installments. There are no familiar emotions shown between the 3, either, even between the parents to each other. They just do their jobs as if they were only work friends. Then, during a con, the family runs into-and recruits-Gina, which makes Evan jealous, at first, but she soon starts having feelings that are anything but jealousy. Each person has their own quirks-and I can handle quirky-but sometimes it was as if it was just being quirky for the point of being quirky. Some things just didn't seem to work for me.
It's rated ""R"" for language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.

19,masonfisk,DO YOU WANT QUIRK W/YOUR COFFEE...?,8,11 March 2021,"Miranda July's latest release from last year. We find ourselves following a family of grifters (father, mother & daughter as essayed by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger & Evan Rachel Wood) as they hope, through their various ploys into making money (stealing packages from the post office, returning gifts to their point of sale for the cash, etc.) to make themselves rich but when an opportunity for them to go to New York (they're in LA & they've won a trip to the Big Apple) & they can't cash out the winning tickets, they decide to fly out, spend a day & return where Woods will claim the airlines lost her luggage so they get $1500 which they desperately need for rent (they live in an office for dirt cheap because there's a consistent wall leak they have to keep on top of) but on the return trip from New York, the family (specifically Jenkins & Winger) meets a fellow traveler, played by Gina Rodriguez, who becomes fascinated by their lifestyle & quickly decides to join the crew leaving Wood a bit perturbed because not only is she on the outs now w/the fam but she knows her parents well enough that the whole relationship (especially since Rodriguez institutes a new scheme to rip off the elderly she home visits) is a big con. What follows is a conflict of conscience for Wood who realizes she's never really been loved as a child but used as a device to get a grift to completion. July has co-opted a normally gritty crime melodrama & dipped it in her usual well of quirk w/Wood giving a slightly over the top rendering of a accomplished slacker who spends more time trying to be a master swindler when a real job would probably entail less. Jenkins is pitch perfection as the domineering underachiever w/Winger unrecognizable under a bob of unkempt hair. Rodriguez provides her usual ray of optimism in the midst of all the cons who becomes a vessel for Wood to make that next step. Also starring Betsy Baker as an airlines rep.",Kajillionaire
20,jadepietro,Ms. Con-Genealogy,6,20 December 2020,"IN BRIEF: This story about some con artists has too many leaps of logic, despite its fine cast and some compelling odd moments.JIM'S REVIEW: (MILDLY RECOMMENDED) As the saying goes, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" In America, it seems there's one born every second these days and writer/director Miranda July seems to agree with my assessment in her latest film Kajillionaire. This movie about a family of grifters living the lowest rung of poverty is her subject and she wants moviegoers to be taken in by their captivating and illegal survival skills. Many critics were; I wasn't, although I did enjoy the oddity factor.Ms. July has a unique vision of society and creates a bizarre world of characters, none of which seem based on reality. We meet another dysfunctional family, the Dyne clan: scheming patriarch Robert (Richard Jenkins), neglectful mother Theresa (Debra Winger), and their vulnerable daughter named Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood) as they con their way to success. They live in a rented office space next to a bubble making company. On one of their many scams, they meet and adopt Melanie (Gina Rodriguez) into the criminal fold and the family dynamics are permanently altered.As the hustles grow bigger and more complicated, the movie loses all credibility. Their rate of success seems unstoppable and untenable. One wonders just how they can physically get by to finance their cons and live in their squalor. One also needs to leave logic at the door when seeing the 30+ year old Ms. Woods playing a young twenty-something, although she nearly puts this off due to her charms and acting skills. Ms. Wood creates a lonely wild child who yearns for the nurturing human touch and accomplishes that feat rather well.In fact, Ms. July's highly capable cast is the film's saving grace. They all bring a dark comic edge to the story, especially Ms. Wood and Ms. Rodriguez. Furthermore, the film is enhanced by Ms. July's strong visual imagery that provides the quirkiness of an early Charlie Kauffman. Some fine surreal moments (pink cotton-candy suds foaming down walls, a bathroom that darkens into a black hole in outer space, earthquake tremors that appear to mostly affect the Dyne clan). Yet where Ms. July fails is mostly in her narrative which has weak legs and collapses from the sheer weight of its storytelling. No backstory is offered to establish the characters' behaviors and lifestyle. The many lapses of reality from a storytelling perspective grow contrived and are inconsistent in tone.Kajillionaire is entertaining but incredulous. It ends up conning itself. (GRADE: C+)",Kajillionaire
21,Jeremy_Urquhart,I think I liked it??,7,28 October 2021,"An odd movie that I think I mostly liked? It was quirky in a way that constantly veered towards too much quirk (something like Garden State *vomits in mouth*), but never quite crossed that line.Some of it's funny, some of it's quite sad, and some.... I didn't know what to make of some of it, but that's okay.If you want a great crime film, you're probably looking in the wrong place. The characters are hustlers and maybe small time criminals in a sense, but it's more focused on their very unusual family dynamics as a way to drive the drama.Never seen Evan Rachel Wood give a performance like this before, and she's really good, as it the always solid Richard Jenkins. Have to give props to the compelling and unusual soundtrack, too- maybe even the most memorable part of an already strangely memorable film.",Kajillionaire
22,NijazBaBs,aimless nonsense,2,10 November 2020,"There is nothing clear in this movie. No point, no explanation, no sense, no logic. The only reason it deserves at least 1 more star than worst rating is because there are bit good good small details like real life locations and experiences, jokes, funny and odd characters, all which look natural and inspirational. For example I liked the joke about phone and internet and sexual encounters with hot dark girl. But besides those few small micro qualities, movie is waste of time. Nothing to see, discover, conclude. Just some content which is useless, boring, and even looking like some nightmare or insanity because of too much odd behaviors and characters. Camera man did a good job tough, because movie at least looks like a movie and not like amateur vlog from camera's perspective. Also the biggest thing besides trying to determine the purpose of the movie was to determine the sex or gender of main character. So, somewhat good experience YES, movie NO.",Kajillionaire
23,msbreviews,Kajillionaire gains Miranda July one more fan!,7,13 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)This is the first movie I watch from Miranda July. She's been delivering films well-received by critics, but audiences seem to be pretty divisive about her storytelling methodology. Not that many people watch her movies, which doesn't quite allow me to draw a conclusion about what the general public thinks about her, but there's a clear tendency for overall positive feedback when a lot of people put their eyes on one of her pieces instead of just a couple of hundreds. Therefore, I was really intrigued by Kajillionaire's synopsis, and the cast is interesting, to say the least. So, does Miranda conquers one more fan, or am I too stubborn to convince?Her unconventional filmmaking style definitely captures my attention, but it's her incredibly subtle character development that ultimately wins me over. Evan Rachel Wood's Old Dolio doesn't know how to live or what life truly is. She doesn't understand or feels fundamental human interactions due to the loveless parenting that accompanied her throughout her entire life. She only knows how to steal, cheat, and live a life outside of the law. She believes life is meaningless and that a massive earthquake will change everything. So, Old Dolio is an easy character to root for and to connect with when things don't work out as she expects. It's impossible not to feel sorry for her. I constantly felt sad and even uncomfortable when she was emotionally suffering.Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld, Frozen II) offers a unique interpretation of someone with this kind of personality, even changing her voice tone, delivering a notably layered performance. Evan and Gina Rodriguez (Melanie) share impeccable chemistry, a vital component in the main plot. Their characters create such an emotional bond that any sane and educated viewer will understand where their relationship is driving towards. This friendship is treated in such a respectful and realistic manner from Miranda July that I felt extremely pleased by everything surrounding it. It's undoubtedly the primary source of entertainment.However, it's Gina Rodriguez (Annihilation, Scoob!) who genuinely elevates the whole story. Honestly, in my opinion, it's her career-best performance. With tiny, little facial expressions, she's able to clearly transmit to the viewer everything Melanie is feeling. She's introduced at the right time, just when the film needs a push. Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger are also outstanding, especially the former who gives his character a few unexpected, emotionally powerful moments. Both parents are as cold and rigorous as they could be, teaching her daughter how to survive without any affection instead of how to live and be filled with love.Miranda July writes a compelling narrative, packed with dramatic sequences, but also with quite a bit of humor. She employs a somewhat slow pacing, which doesn't always work in favor of the movie. In fact, if it wasn't for Gina and Evan's incredibly captivating interactions, Kajillionaire would suffer much more from the family's scamming business, something that quickly loses my enthusiasm. Sebastian Winterø's cinematography is driven by the characters, lingering on their reactions longer than usual, letting the emotions sink in, and allowing the viewer to connect with the characters. This is impeccable work, aided by seamless editing (Jennifer Vecchiarello).Technically, it's a pretty well-produced film, but I do have an issue with the score by Emile Mosseri. I really enjoy most of the themes, but occasionally the volume is so loud that I had trouble listening to what the characters were saying. Since I had the option of going back a few seconds, I could hear some scenes again, so it didn't exactly hurt my viewing. However, it's still a technical issue that made me stop the movie, something I absolutely dislike, and I don't know how much it could have impacted me had I watched this film at a theater.In the end, Kajillionaire convinces me well enough to add Miranda July to my list of ""directors to follow closely"". Boasting a character-driven narrative and a unique filmmaking style, Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez share impressive chemistry, elevating their characters' relationship, which is definitely the most captivating arc of the whole movie. Both Melanie and Old Dolio go through an extremely detailed yet visually subtle character development, which compelled me to root for their success in life. Gina steals the show with a career-best performance, but Evan's bizarre display is also remarkable, as well as Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger's excellent portrayals of the parents. Technically, Sebastian Winterø's camera work and Jennifer Vecchiarello's editing work perfectly together, but Emile Mosseri's beautiful score is occasionally dialed up to a volume that hurts some dialogues. The slow pacing employed doesn't quite work all the time, and the family's swindling business quickly loses interest besides defying logic a couple of times. Overall, I recommend it to everyone, so give it a watch if you can!Rating: B",Kajillionaire
24,0w0,"An interesting premise, that doesn't go anywhere really...",5,17 October 2020,"Imagine this: A movie following the exploits and scams of a family of scamming low-lifes... that sounds really interesting right? Well, they somehow managed to take that pretty interesting premise and make basically NOTHING out of it... the movie isn't funny, and it has very little intrigue, and extremely little drama, and very little adventure.... so it basically has nothing that a movie should have. The movie just kind of drags its feet for 1hour30minutes and then at the very end exhales a very agonizing and labored last breath... it's not really worth watching tbh, not even once! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you're a massive Evan Rachel Wood fan.",Kajillionaire

26,sweidman-28016,Intoxicating,8,16 October 2020,"""We can only ever be how we are.""Miranda July has won me over with her writing and directing. I haven't seen any of her other works but just from this movie I can tell she's someone I should look out for in the future. As a crime-comedy, this works on all levels. Through it all I was entertained. I found the comedy refreshing and worked around human emotion rather than making dumb jokes. What really invested me is the drama. Coming out of the theater I felt like I went through an existential crisis. Starting around the second act, at a certain moment in fact, things take a turn. Not a twist in the story but rather the tone and theme. I enjoyed the first act but wanted a little more out of it. Initially I thought the film would follow this plot with some drama weaved in there somehow. Well that drama came in the most unexpected way where it felt like a kick in the gut. From that moment on I hoped the film wouldn't end.As a filmmaker, July has a distinct style. She could be categorized under a similar style as Wes Anderson and Taika Waititi. The wide shots showing the uniqueness of the characters early on tell the audience what they're getting into. The camera work in general is well done. There's a scene that everyone will take away after viewing where the cinematography, writing, and directing come hand-in-hand. The way it's done could've been told in a normal fashion, but July makes an awesome decision. I found myself just gawking at the screen.Through the character of Old Dolio, life lessons are told. Evan Rachel Wood has an amazing transformative performance. Had I not known previously that she is the lead, I would've never guessed. There's something about the film that felt off and it took me a few days to figure it out. Throughout the film, Old Dolio is discovering truths about life. They're truths that we all know about, though, so there's a bit of a connection issue with her character and script. Not that you can't connect with her character because there are some really emotional gripping scenes, but since you know more about the real world than her it's a little more difficult to feel exactly what she's feeling. The character that we can (hopefully) relate to most is Gina Rodriguez. One of her better performances since Annihilation and Jane the Virgin, she brings a lot more to the film than expected. What first seems like a cameo from her actually turns out to be a key role. Richard Jenkins always does a great job and that's no exception here. I found him to be comical yet extremely frustrating. And finally Debra Winger has a similar performance to Jenkins. They match each other well as a duo and she has a powerful scene with Evan Rachel Wood.Much like The Favourite and Phantom Thread, Kajillionaire becomes increasingly the intoxicating every day after watching. The great score by Emile Moserri has been on repeat in my head and on Spotify. Scenes have played out when I close my eyes. What started as really good movie has become one of the best of the year for me. I urge you to see Kajillionaire. It won't be everyone's cup of tea but it's a great example of filmmaking and acting.",Kajillionaire

28,SnobReviews,A brilliant and beautiful film.,9,28 October 2020,"Beautifully thought-provoking and altogether unique; ""Kajillionaire"" plays on surrealism with an incredible approach from writer/director Miranda July.In this comedy-drama, a young woman's life is turned upside down when her criminal parents invite an outsider to join them on a heist.I'll be dead honest with you all; I didn't think I'd enjoy this film. The trailer was weird and thought it would be too artsy for me. Turns out, I absolutely loved ""Kajillionaire"". I was so moved by the story and by Evan Rachel Wood's performance. The actress deserves tons of recognition for this role. The humour in this film is quirky and dark at times but the story can resonate with anyone. Writer/director Miranda July has penned one of the best films of 2020 that will have you laughing but also questioning the void inside all of us.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",Kajillionaire
29,daisukereds,Too much..,2,25 October 2020,"An EXTREME exaggeration of a realistic situation that might be relatable to something somewhere.. Wh-What did I just watch? I can't say it was pretty, or thoughtfully put. I'm sure this is the sort of thing a class in cinema appreciation would have a field day with it. People feeling like they don't belong to a family, fear of sudden death by natural phenomenon, being stingy or living simply or the contrary, people that don't or can't ever relate to others and the way they lead their lives?? Something, surely.
How do you even review something like this?
I like both female leads.. I guess. I liked the way it ended, even if I expected it from the beginning. But these people are just too weird, and I would find it hard to believe they exist in our reality. Their interaction and how they even ended together is just..Still, I noticed varying levels of quality in sound recordings, almost as if those lines were ADR'd. The camera work and colors, locations, etc.. it's rather boring. The dialogue was poor as well.
I can't recommend it to anyone, and you HAVE to be in the mood for this kind of work (which some would categorize as ""try hard"").",Kajillionaire
30,MogwaiMovieReviews,"What Is Family, and What Counts As Living?",8,18 October 2020,"I've been a big fan of Miranda July all the way back to her magnificent debut Me and You and Everyone We Know in 2005 - she's only directed one full length movie since then, The Future (2011), but she's still one of the small handful of filmmakers (along with Wes Anderson, Charlie Kaufman and I guess to a lesser extent Yorgos Lanthimos, Spike Jonze, Paul Thomas Anderson and Quentin Tarantino) that I am continually keeping an eye on to see what they come up with next.I've gotten so used to disappointment in modern movies that I wasn't expecting that much from her new one Kajillionaire - it was being spoken of as a ""crime drama"" and I couldn't see how her unique humour and delicate observations on the human condition would translate into, and survive within, some fast-paced, tough-talking, grittily realistic heist movie. It turns out I was completely hoodwinked, and this is no more a true ""crime drama"" than, say, Harold & Maude. It's just as funny and strange as every other thing Miranda July has made, and that's all I really would have asked for.The story itself is very simple: a dysfunctional family of hand-to-mouth-living grifters try to come up with some scam to pay off their back rent while involving a stranger they meet by chance, and a relationship of sorts begins to blossom between her and the daughter.It's a small film, the same way PT Anderson's Punch Drunk Love is, with essentially a cast of four and a handful of memorable bit parts, but everyone is perfect. Evan Rachel Wood, as the frumpy, stunted and neglected daughter, was a revelation to me, as I'd only seen her as the Little House On The Prairie-like android in Westworld. Here, she looks like nothing so much as a Jay in search of a Silent Bob, and sounds almost exactly like a Bill & Ted-era Keanu Reeves.But her Old Dolio is still the heart of the story, whose journey and transformation we are following, and I know if I was a lesbian, this is the kind of ""gay representation"" I would be wanting to see, and celebrating at every opportunity far more than mediocre trash like Blue Is The Warmest Colour or whatever virtue signalling celebrity project is getting all the media platitudes this week. Here, the lesbian romance is simply presented as two human beings finding each other amid a sea of other human beings, one type of human interaction amongst all the other, equally impactful human interactions one encounters in the course of life. Men are not vilified, and every person we encounter is treated with equal compassion and humanity. This is the kind of artistic vision we desperately need more of, to counteract all the divisive identity politics that have taken over and ruined Hollywood the past 10 years or so, and I'm just so thankful Miranda July exists.",Kajillionaire
31,mike-c-b,"Same mumbling, complaining, and panic whispering as most movies.",4,31 October 2020,"It had promise, but as with many modern movies, it's non stop mumbling and complaining. Panic whispering. There was also a loud drumming over most of the important plot points so you definitely couldn't here what was happening.It would be better if it was just Evan Rachel Wood (being determined) and the film was edited together properly.",Kajillionaire
32,themadmovieman,"A little too odd at first, but really comes into its own later on",7,10 October 2020,"There's no getting away from it: Kajillionaire is an odd film. At first, it seems like a movie made for the sake of being weird, but as its story unfolds, you begin to see the method to Miranda July's madness, with an ultimately touching, bittersweet tale of personal independence making for a memorable watch.First things first, if you're not party to a little bit of eccentricity and dry humour, you might find Kajillionaire rather inaccessible at first. Undeniably, the film struggles to find its feet in an eye-catching but admittedly dull opening act, as we follow the strange day-to-day exploits of a family of scam artists.Evan Rachel Wood, Debra Winger and Richard Jenkins are fantastic in those roles, but there's very little to their characters early on, and it takes a while for Kajillionaire to really grab you with any real dramatic depth.Fortunately, things take a turn for the better with the arrival of Gina Rodriguez, who brings a little bit of sense to an otherwise totally bizarre world. The film retains its offbeat sense of humour, but to have that grounded perspective with Rodriguez's excellent performance really helps you to find an in with this family, and the story begins to work off that really nicely.Unfolding in thoroughly engaging fashion from then on, Kajillionaire deals with a range of interesting and sobering themes including poverty, neglect, abuse, all with a tinge of odd, dark humour to make it that little bit easier to stomach. Admittedly, the film's stranger side does occasionally undermine some of its more serious ideas, but without that charisma, it would likely have been a far less interesting watch.Kajillionaire really comes good in its final act, however, where it begins to push the boat in terms of weirdness, but also in real, challenging drama. The run to the finish here features some of the movie's oddest moments, but also some of its most affecting and heart-wrenching ones, as we follow Evan Rachel Wood as she begins to discover the world for herself - away from her parents' unique worldview.Along with Rodriguez, Wood is really fantastic and brings an impressive dramatic dynamic to a film that can occasionally feel a little emotionally opaque. Again, its themes aren't quite as hard-hitting because of its oddity, but there is real, affecting drama in the film's final stages, and that really caps it off in impressive fashion.Overall, I liked Kajillionaire. It's not a perfect film, and perhaps doesn't manage to use its capacity for eccentricity to full effect, but there's still a worthy story to be heard here. With great performances, interesting themes and unique humour, it's a memorable, if not undeniably odd watch.",Kajillionaire

36,youngcollind,Offbeat mixture of sweet and salty,9,20 July 2021,"Kajillionaire is a lot of things at once, and skilfully weaves it all together to great effect. It's an absurdist comedy that gets genuine laughs, mostly from the fantastic character brought to life by Evan Rachel Wood. The film treads on similar territory to Napoleon Dynamite's awkward humour, but also takes on a surrealist tone with the loose depictions of reality that move the story to some unexpected places. It doesn't stay comedic throughout though, and explores some bleak nihilistic themes before offering redemption through touching romance/family drama. Surprisingly, it's still able to maintain it's quirky charm even when tackling more serious matters, and should be a treat to anyone willing to embrace it's spectrum of moods.",Kajillionaire

There are good acting, good photography, and some well-handled humorous parts in the film. The plot can be confusing because there is no development of why the parents of the protagonist take that way of life, the character of Gina Rodríguez lacks development and the development of the story is slow.What the film tries to expose is more focused on the love of parents for their children, and what children expect from their parents, personally I think it is a film with a complex plot as well as its message and that it is not so good and not so bad, it is in the middle where it should be given a chance.",Kajillionaire
39,diggnuts,Interesting film.,8,19 October 2020,"I'm not really sure if this story is a critique of or a result from the pervasive views in American culture on poverty, success and charity, but it is very interesting.I'm leaning towards the later, which would make it less poignant for me, but there are problems with the first interpretation, which of its face does seem to carry some message.If we view it as a critique, the presented main philosophy makes no real sense as these people, who are clearly mad, opt out of the general notion of consumerism that is is standard in the USA though all classes of rich and poor. These people clearly are deluded and not very ethical. It almost seems that the main protagonist needs charity to escape the non US way of living and this is reached with sacrifice.The other view of course takes the position that the general views in the USA on these themes are considered true. So your success if mostly decided by you, poverty is a choice and charity is better than any type of social safety net.There is however a third option, but this seems a bit too.. sophisticated for the intended audience. I could very well be intentional to construct a jarring situation that rides the knife-edge of these American Dream mantras and exposed them by means of pure absurdity. Everybody is flawed in their convictions and your ideals are not necessarily linked to your moral fibre.Who knows. It was interesting.",Kajillionaire

41,PotassiumMan,"Offbeat, superb portrayal of Boomer sociopathy",9,8 October 2020,"This indie drama about a destitute family of petty thieves living in squalor in Los Angeles might seem predictable at first but is actually a slow-burn take on the steep pitfalls of toxic parenting and co-dependency for young adults. It is a blistering depiction of a family living on the edges of society, holding on by a thread and stubbornly committed to its corrupt ways. By day, they are scrounging and stealing whatever they can. By night, they live together in a dilapidated back office under the roof of a forgiving landlord who meekly enforces the collection of the rent.It's an acting tour de force with Evan Rachel Wood giving a subtly potent performance as a young woman who is starved for any affection or emotional nourishment, but who hardly ever questions the family orthodoxy. Jenkins and Winger are riveting as the scheming parents who, for we all know, never took the straight and narrow but who have no qualms about employing their child in their criminal versatility. Although the parents in this film are dirt poor, their undying selfishness is a trait that makes them so Boomer-esque, for lack of a better word. It is not too early in the least to have a film tackle the parenting style of a generation that has become known for its solopsism. Gina Rodriguez is actually quite good as the third party accomplice that this sketchy family chances to come across. She is the first character I can think of who goes from annoying to sexy in the history of cinema. Wood's role as the helpless adult child in the family is compelling. She has known nothing but the life of co-dependency and petty crime at her parents' behest until she sees the first check made out in her name, her first taste of independence, a dwelling without her parents and a new female friend with a shapely body. It becomes the discovery of a lifetime for someone raised by parasites.The film's quirky feel belies the heart-wrenching material in the story of a young woman seeking to heal from the harmful legacy of toxic parents and find her own way in the world. The immense truths it digs into strike a chord for anyone who knows what a cancer that manipulative parents can be. I've waited a long time for a film like this and here it is. Recommended to the highest degree- even to those who cannot relate to this kind of upbringing.",Kajillionaire

The trailers didn't do a whole lot to impress me but I checked it out anyway and it was worth it. This has some of the best writing and lead performances of the year although not my favorite. Miranda July definitely knows what she is doing here. Her directing and writing feel so personal and intimate and she is able to craft one of the most unique stories of the year. There were a couple of slow bits but that didn't bug me too much but overall, the story was fascinating and engaging. Mostly because the characters here are very well developed and performed. Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez were amazing here and I thought their characters were great. The parents played by Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger were also great too. Each has their own motivations and personality that is separate from everyone else and unique. The film was also very well shot and edited and the humor mostly hits. For a comedy, I didn't get a ton of laughs out of it but there were a lot times where I did chuckle. Even though some of the comedy didn't hit, it succeeded very well at all of its emotional hits.

46,joshbarton15,Great piece of work from Miranda July.,8,7 October 2020,"Everyone at some point in their life feels that they aren't part of a normal family, whether it be as a result of how you were raised or growing apart as life goes on. I doubt anyone out there would be able to claim being part of such an oddball family as in Miranda July's Kajillionaire, a quirky crime comedy that I typically love getting stuck into.Old Dolio Dyne's (Evan Rachel Wood) life is turned upside down when her parents (Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger) invite outsider, Melanie (Gina Rodriguez), to join them on a major heist they're planning.Kajillionaire opens in such intriguing fashion and maintains a sense of obscurity throughout that I certainly didn't fully connect with but found myself drawn to the deft character work from Miranda July and the film being rather striking visually. July's writing really does capture the desperation of this family and how the constant hustling and new arrival has driven a wedge right through the unnatural bond these parents share with their daughter, the comedy subtle in its execution and suiting the film to a tee.The performances in Kajillionaire are brilliantly nuanced and not so in your face with the obscurity to put people off. They are a weird bunch but the performances from Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger as the parents are really good as their grip on the control of their daughter's life slips away. It's Evan Rachel Wood that really stands out here though, the introduction of Melanie into her life throwing her into an existential crisis that Wood throws herself into fabulously, heartbreaking as it is captivating.Miranda July's Kajillionaire may not make a lot of noise to grab your attention but it's a film that deserves to be sought out, July's filmmaking and the performances leading it to become one of my favourites of the year.",Kajillionaire

48,cappiethadog,Performance mother,8,15 March 2021,"Critics poo-poohed the talking cat. The general public, perhaps, read about the talking cat and stayed away in droves. ""The Future"", despite being nominated for a Golden Bear at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival, bombed at the box office. Even the Sundance crowd shunned it. Miranda July, in the interim, wrote a well-received novel, ""The First Bad Man"", a New York Times Notable Book, but the performance artist didn't work in the film medium for nine years. ""Kajillionaire"", for all intents and purposes, is the follow-up to ""Me, You, and Everyone We Know"", the 2005 winner of the Camera d'or at Cannes. What the filmmaker took away from the disappointing reception for ""The Future"" is that people like to laugh.Paw Paw wasn't funny. Voiced by July, as it turns out, a miscalculation on the performance artist's part, nobody wanted to hear the interior monologue of a stray cat's dashed hopes to be loved. Paw Paw gets euthanized. His would-be owners, Jason(Hamish Linklater) and Sophie(Miranda July) missed the cat's pick-up date. ""Never been petted, not even once,"" Paw Paw says, in a love-it or hate-it voice. Depending on who you are, July's caterwaul will either sound lamentable or cloying. People approached ""The Future"" with preconceived notions about the filmmaker. They expected another quirky comedy, not Brechtian drama. The conceit of a talking cat was confused for deadpan schtick. Miranda July made a real attempt to capture the emotional life of four-legged sentient being, and not with easy kid-movie level anthropomorphism, but through animal cognition, a translation of gradating purrs and meows. Per chance, call it serendipity, Paw Paw bloodied his paw, and the passersby, the couple slated to adopt the Siamese, brought the then-anonymous cat to an animal shelter, what the learned feline calls a ""cageatorium"". Love invented Paw Paw. Beforehand, he was just ""cat"", unfamiliar with heaven on earth. Paw Paw was ignorant about cat toys, and that wet food comes from cans and dry food comes from bags. Paw Paw accepted the world he was born into. But after this glimpse into how other cats live, Paw Paw can't go back, now that he is so close to the precipice of domesticity. To receive and reciprocate love, the fundamental need to touch and be touched, it's a through line, this theme, starting with ""Me, You, and Everyone We Know"", in which the filmmaker, presumably, playing a version of herself, Christine Jesperson, a struggling performance artist , is rebuffed by the shoe salesman of her dreams, Richard Swersey(John Hawkes), a recent divorcee with two biracial sons. In ""Kajillionaire"", the language of love is harder to translate from the heart to the soul. The filmmaker, more or less, recycles the same theme of first love from ""The Future"". Not romantic love, but love in the holistic sense, the finishing touch that makes you uniquely human, or in this filmic instance, uniquely cat, and not just the end product of simple biology left to fend for itself. Old Dolio(Evan Rachel Wood), the daughter of careerist grifters, in ""Kajillionaire"", isn't coming of age, she's coming to life.""Kajillionaire"" begins with a comic set piece, a post office heist, which hardly passes for your typical family outing, but Old Dolio doesn't know this. Robert(Richard Jenkins) and Theresa(Debra Winger), the young woman's parents, act as if they are strangers, which in and of itself is not unusual since they're a crime family at work. They're doing a job. In an alleyway, they go through the contents of the stolen parcel that Old Dolio lifted from somebody's post box. For all her trouble, the risk of committing what is essentially a federal crime, Old Dolio's booty is a small stuffed animal. Undeterred, she reaches for her wallet, takes out a toy store receipt from one of the plastic sleeve where normally pictures of loved ones are kept, and seems happy(what passes for happiness in her hermetic world), with a match that nets her thirteen dollars. Old Dolio's androgyny isn't a personal choice. Richard and Theresa raised their child with no respect to gender. She's an it. Old Dolio is a name you give to a cat or dog. With a start, the audience realizes that on or off the job, Old Dolio's parents treat her like a business associate. Later in ""Kajillionaire"", Melanie(Gina Rodriguez), an ""Ocean's Eleven""-loving woman they meet on an airplane, asks Old Dolio: ""How did you meet them?"" It never occurs to Melanie that they're related, let alone, her parents. Twenty-six and unformed, Old Dolio's signature outfit is a green tracksuit, because nobody taught her to be a girl, or the slightest bit feminine, even. By default, she's a tomboy. The next job, there is always a next job, requires her to return a wristwatch to the owner they stole it from. As a reward, Old Dolio receives a gift certificate for one free massage. Going forward, ""Kajillionaire"" switches gears, moving into darker territory. When Jenny(Da'vine Joy Randolph), the masseuse, starts the session, Old Dolio's body stiffens at the slightest touch of her hands. This bit of seeming physical comedy, which started with the ninja moves at the federal facility, and then the funny walk, in which Evan Rachel Woods, with great limberness, leans backwards without breaking stride, as a means of avoiding detection from her character's landlord, curdles, In retrospect, what was mistaken for physical comedy, actually is tragi-comic body horror. Like Paw Paw, the young woman is a feral being, never having experienced romantic or parental love, never having ever been touched.Home is a rented office in the business district. Their next-door neighbor is a bubble factory. The office walls drip soap, like blood from the Lutz family house in an imagined version of ""The Amityville Horror"" directed by Jacques Tati, whose hose factory in ""Mon Oncle"" can be construed as a reference point. Old Dolio, without any reservations, wipes down the office walls every time the factory owner releases the pink bubble runoff, as if this household chore was commonplace, the equivalent of dishwashing or vacuuming. And then, finally, at long last, some divine intervention changes her life. To help raise delinquent rent money, for twenty bucks, Old Dolio attends a prenatal class in place of a complete pregnant stranger, Kelli(Rachel Ashley Redleaf), the accidental angel. The class instructor(Diana Maria Riva) shows a video, a mother/baby bonding exercise called the ""breast crawl"". Old Dolio, for the first, realizes that her family isn't normal. In ""The Future"", Jason and Sophie, due to the cat's renal problems, are under the impression that they're committing to five months of round-the-clock care. The veterinarian informs the couple that Paw Paw, with enough tender loving care, can live well-beyond this predetermined time frame. Old Dolio are like those good, but not great samaritans; they're just not willing to put in the time to care for another living creature, cat or otherwise, probably from the outset. The young woman can't imagine Theresa permitting her to do the breast crawl.Theresa is a terrible mother. It's no coincidence that the filmmaker, in both ""Me, You, and Everyone We Know"" and ""The Future"", play childless women. Richard, in the former, invites the performance artist to meet Peter(Miles Thompson) and Petey(Brandon Ratcliff), but the filmmaker cuts to the younger boy, Petey, leaving the familial property with urgency, suggesting that his first encounter with their future stepmother was a disaster. He encounters a man waiting for the bus; he bangs a coin against the metal pole of a sign. The man explains that he's ""just passing the time,"" a commentary, perhaps, on parenthood, as opposed to pursuing artistic endeavors. In the latter, Gabriella(Isabella Acres), the daughter of Sophie's new boyfriend(David Warshofsky), digs a hole in the backyard. ""To...?"" the former dancer jokes. It's a bad joke, a joke only a childless woman would make, since...is still practiced there. Gabriella, quite pointedly, buries herself up to the head. In ""The Future"", the filmmaker offers up another version of herself, the struggling performance artist who gave up. Sophie teaches dance to children with a visible lack of enthusiasm. The filmmaker expresses her possible alter ego's unsuitability for motherhood with surrealism. A yellow plastic bag, an exact replica of the tarp in miniature that the children hide under in a dance class activity, slowly creeps up the street like a haunting. The bag stops in her room. Sophie, already in the process of settling into life as a suburban housewife, allows herself to be subsumed by the growing fluid bag. It's an awakening, long dormant. It's the dance of the woman as artist. She emerges from the chrysalis, newly-born, unrecognizable to Marshall, a performance artist. They split up. She returns to Jason.The filmmaker is a confessional artist, unafraid to show us her warts and all. In ""Kajillionaire"", consistent with her short, but impressive filmography, she deploys a stand-in, and it's not Old Dolio; it's the mother, Theresa, who explains to her daughter that she lacks the maternal instinct gene. For the whole of the money from their latest scam, Theresa can't call her biological daughter ""Hon,"" a term of endearment that rolls off her tongue so easily, Old Dolio had observed, when talking to Melanie, while role-playing the perfect family to please a dying man, whose house they plan on ransacking. Being a mother, the kind that asks how your day was, Theresa explains, is not who she is. They're con artists, emphasis on the artist. Like the filmmaker, Theresa collaborates, not coddles; treats them like little adults.To be anything otherwise, would be performance art.In ""The Future"", Jason literally stops time. On a subconscious level, both he and Sophie can't even commit to a cat.""Kajillionare"" is a what if film.",Kajillionaire
49,varun-25071997,The Climax Is The Best Part Of The Film,8,18 October 2020,"Pleasantly surprised by the ending, felt it was inevitable but at the same time my mind lingered upon the climax being a betrayal. The script is absolutely brilliant and has everything a low budget independent movie requires. Marketing the film as a heist/caper makes sense if you understand the ending but many wouldn't expect something unconventional. Kajillionaire is the exact opposite of Giuseppe Tornatore's The Best Offer in a literal sense.Kajillionaire tells the story about 26 year old Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood) who was trained by her parents (Richard Jenkins and Debra Winger) to be con artists from the day she was born, depriving her of a childhood. In the middle of a con, they meet Melissa (Gina Rodriguez) a young enthusiastic woman who is more than happy to be a part of their gang. Old Dolio gets jealous because of the affection her parents show for Melissa but what happens next forms the rest of the story leading to genre changing conclusion.The con in this film is metaphorical in the bigger picture but the literal heist we see appears to just a small loss to make up for the greater good for the affected characters. Miranda July is a strong contender for Best Screenplay and Richard Jenkins for Supporting Actor in the upcoming awards season. Its a shame the pandemic forced this film to release on VOD as it was clearly made for the cinema. Kajillionaire is comfortably one of the best movies of this year and its legacy will vastly improve over time.",Kajillionaire

51,RMurray847,Challenging but worthwhile in the end,7,18 January 2021,"Robert (Richard Jenkins) and Theresa (Debra Winger), along with their grown daughter Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood) are a ""team of con artists"" living on the fringes of society. The parents have raised their daughter to follow in their footsteps. This sounds like it could be the basis for an intense drama or even thriller. It could also be the basis for a wacky comedy or a family comedy or a dark comedy.Set your expectations elsewhere. KAJILLIONAIRE is its own very unique, strange drama/comedy hybrid. I put ""team of con artists"" in quotations because these guys are TERRIBLE at what they do. They put A LOT of energy into their schemes yet things go wrong or the amount of return they expect is way above reality. They live on the fringes of society (in fact, they live in a crumbling office suite that is located next to a bubble factory , a bubble factory] and each day they must get back to their home/office at the same time in order to clear away the bubbles that leak through the wall). They barely have enough money for food. Your first thought after spending 10 minutes with them is ""if they just put this energy into a real job, they'd be fine."" But the parents also are paranoid: the government is watching them, there are secret rays beaming at us through cell phones, etc. etc. These guys are nuts (I realize that's a very uncharitable and non-PC characterization, but believe me, watching the movie, you will have the same reaction.) And their adult child has been raised like this. Mistrusting. Living on the edge of the law. And without hugs and affection either. She's emotionally stunted, and even moves through the world with weird posture. She doesn't fit in. You can sense she's aware that she's in an unworkable and abnormal situation, but has no sense of a way out.Into this strange, fringe family comes Melanie (Gina Rodriquez), a vibrant, flashy, energetic but also troubled young lady who develops a fascination with the family and wants to join in on their con artist ways. She's a natural at the work, but she's also living on a different wavelength. Flashy when they are quiet. Ballsy when they are cowardly. And affectionate. At first, it's the parents that are entertained by her (and Old Dolio is alarmed by her). Yet, these relationships are forced to develop in new ways because of Melanie's intrusion.The PLOT of the film is almost beside the point. It's the relationships that matter. Lots of things happen in the movie, but there's never a strong sense of a beginning, middle and end. And this gives the film a highly rambling quality, which coupled with these very strange people, makes for a tough movie viewing experience. We're not quite sure how our loyalties should lie (or if we should even forge any). Writer/director Miranda July has made the quirkiest movie I've seen in a long time. Sometimes its a playful quirkiness that can make for a bit of fun. Sometimes it feels quirky just for the sake of it, and this deadens the pace of the film at times. The tone of the movie is very challenging; a tightrope walk. July and her cast aren't always 100% successful in staying on the rope.Yet the movie offers plenty of rewards for the patient viewer. When Melanie hits the scene, the carefully constructed strangeness of the central family is blown apart and the film is nearly completely unpredictable at this point. You have the chance to really DISCOVER what happens next, not just sit there and expect the events to unfold in a certain way. These characters are so odd it is almost impossible to guess what they will think, say or do next. And that almost complete uncertainty is its own reward. And the performances are stellar too. Jenkins and Winger are old pros and are a hoot to watch. Rodriquez (who brought so much optimistic energy to Jane The Virgin) explodes on the screen...she was a perfect casting choice. Bubbly and upbeat is SO different than what the others are, it is just fun to see how she causes ripples upon ripples. And Evan Rachel Wood is fascinating. Her voice and mannerisms are unique, and getting to watch her emotionally stunted character at least think about perhaps blossoming just a little is really the true joy of this film. The movie hinges on her ability to pull off the job of taking a very strange character and making her believable. She sticks the landing 99%; and the end of the movie is a quiet but powerful treat.This is a challenging movie. Slow paced (especially the first 30 minutes). Weird. Characters we don't immediately recognize or empathize with. Sounds like a recipe for a poor evening of movie-watching. But in the end, I was oddly exhilarated. The payoff was more emotional than I expected; July planted the seeds of empathy and we didn't quite know it until suddenly they sprouted. A nice surprise!",Kajillionaire

56,tecnogaming,"Trash disguised as ""modern drama""",1,22 October 2021,"Let me start by saying my only interest in the movie was because Evan Rachel Wood, now, after suffering through this movie I am no longer interested in movies where she acts as I've learned my lesson, do not follow the actors, follow the play.And the play is absolutely horrendous, incredible cynical and an accurate reflection of how society thinks of itself, pure trash (at least a big chunk of society where this movie is targeted).Let me sum up what you learn from ""Kajillionare"" in few words.1- It is fine to steal from honest people if you consider you have less than them.2- parenting is awful and your kid should serve you as a tool to get you money.3- talking to strangers and getting to know and bond to create plans to steal from even more honest people because you think that will give you money is great, people should get together to do bad things.4- normal relationships are boring, better be lesbian, it usually fixes all the bad things in life.5- leaving your kid for money is a good thing.It's not that the movie is cynical, it's also a movie that sends all the bad messages, I know this is just a movie but come on, this is trash.

62,i-max,Path to genuine affection,6,18 October 2020,"I don't know any of the actors in this movie, female lead's performance was exceptionally good. On the other hand the directing and storytelling need lots of work in order to have a better interpretation. Lots of moments were weird, or the message might be hidden too deep.Okay I realize I can't write this without spoilers, so here it comes.
The ending was frustrating, the parents knew the money was hidden somewhere and they wanted to have it, but without being too obvious. They probably felt a little sorry for their daughter not being able to have a proper childhood, yeah that doesn't work. So correction *They DON'T feel sorry at all, instead they used the last little bit of trust that the daughter had in them as real parents and stole that money.The first frustrating thing is they didn't use force or wreck the place, instead they clean sweeped it and took everything with them and let their baby daughter have a nice long beautiful sleep until morning to find out. It's guaranteed they'll find the money, and if not the stuff they took would still be worth enough to pay the rent. They probably felt sorry, but as thieves all their lives they didn't want to ""give"" without getting any in return, even if it's their own blood. So by giving their daughter a nice birthday, and a peaceful set of mind things are finally going to change, they were actually investing a night of their time so in return they could get on with their usual business.The second thing is the kiss as the end. I never thought the story would lead to any kind of companionship, although there were awkward signs earlier. Unless, it's a way for her to achieve the ""breast crawling"" mentioned in the film, finally having someone to lean on. This is the only explanation I can think of.I wouldn't watch it again, it's depressing and filled with negativity.

She plays along with these scams to role play as a way to appear as clever and diabolical as her parents much like if they were a band of gypsies where all those involved show who they really are at the end.I'm getting the Blu-ray of this as soon as it comes out.

73,ChrisInMiami,A quirky/fun but plot-light character study.,7,29 August 2021,"PREMISEEvan Rachel Wood stars as the daughter of two cheap con artists. Under the tutelage of her parents, who relish living off the grid with all the other wannabe 'kajillionaires', she has learned all sorts of ridiculous scams that more often than not earn them pennies for their efforts. When she takes a few dollars to attend a court ordered parenting class in place of an expectant mother, something clicks inside and she starts to realize maybe there's more to life.ANALYSISMs. Wood owns and fully inhabits her character with all her conflicts and repressed desires and the heart of the story is her relationship with her parents (played by Richard Jenkins, reliable as ever for his solid character acting, and Deborah Winger who has thankfully returned to acting after a long hiatus). There are enough quirky characters and moments to keep the audience invested and entertained but I think it's what's missing from the story that keeps it from reaching a truly classic character study. The parents present as not only scam artists but also co-dependent mental patients, however, we never get any backstory on them and while the movie works without it, it suffers for the wanting of it. Writer/Director Miranda July introduces a new co-conspirator to the team, but we never fully understand her motivations and once again the story suffers for it. In essence it could have been a multiple character study but all the other people in the film serve only to establish the daughter's story. The slow second act would have been a great place to mine those characters for more story.What's there is great but what's missing could have made it so much better. It reminded me a lot of the great indie 'Slums of Beverly Hills' but with a little tweaking it could have risen to the level of the classics 'Down and Out in Beverly Hills' or 'As Good As it Gets'.7/10 a fun but not completely fulfilling movie.",Kajillionaire

91,syahputraeqqi,Extremely Unexpected,10,19 October 2020,"Miranda July seems to do a very good job of directing this film. I was amazed throughout the film with all the elements in it. A neat combination of character oddities, heart warming feeling, with a crime-comedy dressing, and presenting the reality of the lower class economy. My eyes are always stunned to see every scene and story development that is neat, not rushed, and very interesting.Even though it carries the title kajillionaire, I like it when it is only used as a premise and not continued in the twist, because it will feel cliche if it's done, good job miranda !. The story is funny and entertaining, with the strangeness of each character, in fact it actually supports the story to develop better. Evan Rachel Wood is very exceptional here. The other casts are also very balanced in playing their roles, the problems of each character also support the chemistry and connections that are shown to be more natural. The cinematography that is displayed is very pleasing to the eye, the color palette settings, camera works, and the existing photography-cinema games are amazing, so they bring a light atmosphere with the screenplay that is played. Supported by scoring and background music that add a plus in this film.Overall, it's an amazing mix of all the film elements. I enjoy it so much. And i Love kind of movie like this.",Kajillionaire

There was no chemistry between the characters whatsoever, just a bizarre and strange movie. I laughed at parts for just how ridiculous it was. A 6.4 rating?

A tale of a dysfunctional family when all said and done and yeah not exactly the most redeeming characters but there is hope within them, there is tragedy behind them and there is growth enough to make me feel better be it only for a afternoon but in todays days any little thing that can make one feel better about their life and like, just let you escape is a beautiful thing.I totally get why people dislike this film, some with a passion, but like, its Maranda July what did you expect? She doesn't do rose tint, nor does she wrap it all up with a bow sacrine trite comedy or hackneyed drama.

The plot is fairly simple, but the characters bring it to life. These people seem so real, yet have never been represented in a film, at least nothing that comes to mind. Wood's painfully introverted Dolio pulls you into her corner (was she channeling Christian Bale for the voice?) and Rodriguez' Melanie shines with savvy and decency. Winger creates a character from whole cloth (actually, sort of a Fundamentalist Chic) and Richard Jenkins...Jenkins is magnificent! Throughout, he covers a lot of bases, sidestepping into whichever persona needs to be summoned-but it's subtle, like the look in his eyes from across the room asking for cake as he buys into The Dream-and his toast at the restaurant is guaranteed to move you. Glad I saw this, and if you're looking for humor that doesn't shout at you, give it a go.",Kajillionaire

But honestly, the not knowing is what made this film so fantastic. If I could ever describe a film as intelligent and quirky, without rolling my eyes, this would be it. The movie is weird, it's pretty indie, and it tries a lot of new things. This reminds me of the Florida Film Festival, because of how damn unique the whole film is. It's beautiful, and it's nearly impossible to describe, but I can give it a try. Old Dolio (yes, that is actually the main characters name) is an awkward, out of place 20-something living with her stingy, thieving parents. They do whatever they can to scam the people around them, while trying to make ends meet. When Old Dolio meets Melanie along on a ""heist"" (I use quotations around it because they aren't really heists, more on that later), she begins to realize that she doesn't belong with her parents, and that she might be living a lie. Mixed within the awkwardness of situations like waiting around an old man's house for him to die so the family can take his checking account hostage is a mellow, deeply thoughtful love story. The relationship between Old Dolio and Melanie is handled so unbelievably well, that it is genuinely one of the greatest romance arcs in recent memory. Something about the quirkiness about the film makes it so much more enjoyable, and it almost feels like the director weaponized the art of unsettling behaviors to make something darkly comedic, thoughtful, invoking, and beautiful. It's fantastic.",Kajillionaire

I'd rather go to a dentist than keep watching, I gave it a chance, but proved worthless. Actors were great but just another grifter movie with no product. Kept waiting for something to move me but was nothing there. Expected more got less. High ratings should have been saved for a poor third-world movie. After three/fourths of the movie, with no more drama, got sick and quit.

The parents had one trait shared between them and that was ""being awful people"", whilst the daughter had one trait and that was ""needing therapy of the psychiatric and speech kind"".

NOT ONCE DID I LAUGH. This movie is as slow as snail mail and very bizarre. I kept watching hoping that it would pick up and get funnier. It never did. However, the acting was superb.

This felt like one of those experimental student films from the '70s and '80s. All the little mini-episodes are supposed to meld into a coherent story (didn't happen). Slice of life (I guess) type of storytelling. I never really got a feel for any of the characters. Nothing they said or did made any sense whatsoever. The reveal the morning after the ""birthday party"" defied even the most generous suspension of disbelief (how could two old people move ALL that stuff out of a second floor apartment without being heard). The final reveal at the end (the $525 1/3 part total) was cute, but not as particularly revelatory as one might expect (and that seemed to be the intent).I found nothing special about the performances (except maybe Gina Rodriguez at her sensual best) nor the direction.Felt kind of robbed of the 100 minutes or so spent in an almost empty theater on a Saturday night.

While those are clever little creations of quirk as well, they also work on many different (intelligence) levels, this one however, craves your full attention for the entire time, every scene, line and expression tweaks the story to our and characters continuous surprise. I get some of the criticism, the narrative loses its edge towards the end, but you have to see it for what it is, a declaration of love to the universe, the people in it and snack bags that go pop.

155,bobparmentier,Brilliant and painfully funny,8,5 August 2021,"A very deep, impressive and very humoristic film. I can understand primarily you feel you don't understand the absurdistic humour. If you miss it maybe this film is not for you, but the entering a post office shop and the avoiding of the very understanding landlord are unprecedented. As well as the bizar defect of the place they rented. I thought it was rather hilarious.But most of all, the movie was very touching and not hilarious at all. I really felt sorry for the main character (brilliantly played by Evan Rachel Wood) and was so moved when she gave away her toothpick.Very impressive the way the many layers fluidity changed lanes and back.Loved it!",Kajillionaire

158,JessL03,Plenty of Laughs With a Lot of Heart,9,2 March 2020,"What a wonderful place Miranda July's brain is. I think we are so lucky she is able to share pieces of it with us. I am a fan of July's other work as well, and her latest movie Kajillionaire is probably my favorite of her films so far. Some of the characters' names alone are hilarious. I was able to catch a screening of it at Sundance.Kajillionaire tells the story of a girl and her parents who need to hustle and con people just to get by. Her parents are very odd and jaded by their past lives and the people and government who took part in them. She has grown up in this life of getting by just based on what she is able to steal or find to sell for money. She has learned to mistrust others, and she has never seen her parents showing anyone preference or affection--even her. She is curious about being held, but that makes her feel weak and ashamed. To me, Kajillionaire is one of those movies that made me feel alive. Learning how to love and be loved in return is just beautiful. I found myself laughing out loud one minute, and the next minute I felt quiet or sad. You will be grateful of every good thing you have in your life; not everyone is as fortunate to have a place to live that doesn't leak or even simply someone to hug them.",Kajillionaire

If you lean towards big blockbuster films like fast and furious or marvel movies than yeah this might not be your thing.But if you're into more indie films or character driven films (Wes Anderson, Guillermo Del Toro etc..) than I highly recommend this movie.It's an always changing adventure about a very strange family and their very strange way of living in a society dominated by the need for money. Their strange-ness (if that's a word) is brought out beautifully and put into new perspectives over the course of the film which causes you to continually reevaluate the characters as the film goes on.I'd highly recommend this film to indie lovers and any one who is looking for a film that doesn't fit the traditional molds of modern Hollywood blockbusters.",Kajillionaire

171,ridleyjoe,You should watch this movie.,10,25 March 2021,"So, first up, it's not a ten star film - it's a solid 7, probably an 8 - but I had to try and even out the average because people should watch this movie. If you like Spike Jonze's and Andy Kaufman's stuff, you'll definitely love this movie. It's creative, surreal and has plenty of heart. A delightful and fascinating work on self parenting. It's such a shame the pandemic hit as this film was released, because this film should have got more recognition. There need to be more films like this, Miranda July is unafraid to take risks and cinema is better for it. A note on the negative reviews - sure, this film isn't for everyone, what film is? - but to those who gave it one star and described it as 'boring' and 'pretentious', I would suspect they were unengaged and basic. There's a great quote from Alan Rickman that comes to mind:""This is the world we live in, more and more palliatives, shorter and shorter attention spans and the tragedy is of course that we have a culture that's less and less able to respond to Beckett or Shakespeare at all because they won't have a way in.

I feel that people who didn't feel this movie are probably just cynical or too jaded. Yes, ""feel"", rather than ""get"". If empathy is not something you prefer to repress, this movie might speak to you in a way that you'll understand and feel lighter for it. It's not meant to be entirely realistic, it's meant to convey the vulnerability of the human condition through a quirky story made of illustrative interactions between characters that represent aspects of the human psyche, its needs and conditioning, with no filters (like one of the characters says), and that can't hide who they are, and in that way it ends up being more real (than realistic), and more genuine for it.",Kajillionaire

Most people are a product of their environment but we still have choice if we choose to see. Sometimes someone sees something in us that allows us to rediscover who we are. The characters draw you in, the take on a dysfunctional family is interesting and I think everyone will take away many personal insights if they give this their undivided attention. It's not a comedy per say although I did laugh at moments. Just come in without expectations and enjoy the moment. It's a rollercoaster of emotions. From pain to joy to sadness to hurt and to beauty.

186,jules-12149,A beautiful story of trauma and redemptive love,10,4 November 2020,"This movie immediately became one of my favorite films of all time. It's pure poetry from Miranda Joy and the cast, especially the two leads Evan Rachel Wood and Gina Rodriguez, who have great chemistry. Starkly deprived of affection and social connection, Wood has grown up in service to emotionally disturbed narcissistic parents living on the fringe and exploiting her for their tenuous survival. Wood embodies both trauma and resiliency, and we get to watch her awakening as she grows aware of her deprivation while developing a chance yet fateful connection with Rodriguez, who becomes witness to the family dysfunction. By turns fascinated, horrified, flirtatiously sexy, and resolute, Rodriguez reaches out of her own lonely disappointments to show Wood the first empathy she has ever known.",Kajillionaire

It has some great character development and makes various implicit remarks on life, society, and relationships.In particular, I felt that Evan Rachel Wood's performance was fantastic, especially with such a bizarre character to present, she expressed her perspectives and actions and the emotional scars these reveal tremendously well.Melanie's (Gina Rodriguez) degree of comfort with getting on board with the family's cons moved a little too easily and was insufficiently explained.

Just go outside and look around, and if you are a pompous rich twit then go to india and see the people sleeping under the flyovers,
I mean the only upside of the movie is that they are lesbians and they finally get together but its so freaking painful to wait all the way to the end... its like come on just get together already. From my side I have seen and had enough painful moments in my life that I would definitley prefer to skip having/seeing more.I guess there are people out there that would enjoy this kind of thing... maybe need to have more drama in their life.. but I am completely dumbstruck that I was stupid enough to sit through that. Everything inside me was screaming switch to something else... anything else... but I stuck it out thinking, it has a high rating so there must be a reason. End of the movie.... nope, I was the fool.It was so dumb that I just had to create an account and just warn you what your evening might end up like, just wish I read a few more reviews myself. There is a real trend now days of making depressing movies, it seems like people can relate??? For me, I watch movies to get away from everyday life and the toils and to be able to enjoy the time I get to relax. This was definitely not one of those times.

203,christopher-skala,An alt-fable for living an alt life?,9,30 January 2021,"Disconcerting and initially discombobulating, Kajillionaire reveals itself to be a film expressive of a unique creative sensibility. It is a fable of the death and rebirth of the oddly-named Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood in another of her transformative and mesmerising performances), nursed in love by the tender Melanie (played with exuberance by Gina Rodriguez). Old Dolio is the 26-year-old only daughter of implacable Debra Winger (almost unrecognisable) and lecherous societal outsider Richard Jenkins, raised as an 'equal partner in crime' without tenderness or affection, and trained in the art of the extremely petty con. Like a host of recent American movies, the story posits a nuclear family imagining and living a life completely at odds with the myth of The American Dream. What's fascinating to me is that in constructing such an extreme opposition to commonly accepted liberal values and norms, the writer-director Miranda July is almost forced to accept the impossibility of such an imagining. And yes, you do learn the genesis of Evan Rachel Wood's oddball name ... Highly recommended but be prepared to be launched into a disturbing vision of contemporary America.",Kajillionaire

To be touched, at first it comes off as what the hell is happening but you understand to see things her way. A 26th year old girl living with a deceitful parents in a ruin trying to make them happy though she doesn't know what that it is but it's almost a maternal feeling that she wanted her mom to be a mom even if it's a bad mom. It takes a long and really weird journey with a beautiful strong stranger who seem to be shallow at first but it's probably the kindest person you can't imagine exist in this world, to start a life where she's understands she's human entitled and fully capable to be loved and to love, to dance like literally no one is watching cause that wouldn't be safe, eat small pancakes because small dumb stuff makes us happy and in her case doing a breast crawl apparently, I did mention it's weird.

It contains really good comedy character acting that is totally wonderful, and believable in its world. And it's packed with lots of great ideas wonderfully executed.It is really well directed with a lot of great ideas here too.Don't watch it if you think you're going to get an American Pie 'coming-of-age' style teen comedy.If you usually watch the big hit, summer fun, cookie cutter movies and rarely branch out, it may not be for you.Evan Rachel Wood's characterisation is perfect, as they all are in my opinion, but these are not pop movie characters.As for pace, it never felt slow to me. If you find movies like this interesting then you will be interested all the way through.It also doesn't have that ""indie comedy"" vibe that can often overshadow this sort of comedy, which is nice.It is it's uniqueness that means it doesn't fit into the expected norms of the average movie goer.

Even harder. This movie was fantastic, will I ever watch it again? Maybe not. It was hard to watch, specifically because I work in a place where we see elder abuse, as well as the intense relationships between parent and offspring. And we don't have enough time to go into self suppression of homosexuality.This movie focuses on the things that we should learn as children like writing, reading, social behaviors, love, right and wrong. Our lead character, Old Dolio, fits in with her family, or should I say, fits under. She has been taught to steal, lie, do whatever it takes to make a buck. She hasn't been taught tender feelings, how to interact with other people organically, not what parents are supposed to be like. They use her, even to the point of talking to an old man as he is dying so they can find his checkbook.Dealing with relationships between parent and child, and what that can do to the adult child, this movie succeeds, spectacularly. Dealing with the type of growth stunting that this can cause, is a hard thing to convert, especially successfully. And you've done it. Thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for this movie.",Kajillionaire
210,dobalmorena,"It is not meant to be a comedy, it is a delicate, complicated piece.",10,5 December 2020,"This movie is not a comedy, i have been reading all the other reviews complaining of how this is a comedy, it is not, and if you are not familiar with miranda july's work and twisted sense of humour, dont judge this beautiful movie under commercial, simplistic labels. In fact i kind of wanted to cry the whole movie.",Kajillionaire

212,gsaberi,Horrendous and such a waste of time!,1,30 December 2020,"I am very angry with myself why I waited and watched this cheap movie to the end! I was waiting for something to happen. the rating was +6 so I thought there might be some light at the end of the tunnel, but it dismally failed in any direction. The screenplay is full of holes and nothing logical or makes sense.
At the beginning of the movie the parent are so poor that cannot feed themselves, they are also so desperate but decent that take care of the property as the owner asked, they try to maintain some level of moral. Suddenly, towards the end, everything changes. They offer an indecent proposal to the girl who is not clear why accompany them. They found money to plot a mischievous plan to rub the girl, etc.",Kajillionaire
213,biesemansglen,What? This is very nice!,8,18 February 2021,"What a great original move full of laughs and emotion. Acting is really good. I can imagine its not for everyone, but the low ratings are hard to understand. Jenkins and Woods:wow! Great vibe and a lot of fun at a comfortable pace.",Kajillionaire
214,socky-32541,Bock! Bock!,4,16 February 2021,"This movie would be real awesome, but just one thing wrong, why does Richard Jenkins continue to pretend to be chicken throughout film? He is not CHICKEN he is MAN! But he continues to do chicken dance in most scene, very distract! In one scene he keep saying ""BOCK! BOCK! BOCK!"" real silly stuff. Perhaps if this film was based around a family of chickens this might work, but is not based on chicken, is based in real life human world! Other than the crazy chicken man, is good movie!",Kajillionaire
215,mattsteelerobertson,The most misleading description I've ever read,1,31 January 2021,"A woman's life is ""turned upside down"" due to her criminal parents? Her life from the beginning of the movie was upside down to begin with. That was pretty obvious when they were stealing from a post office and living in that rough apartment. Things actually got a bit better for her when she met that other woman. What ""major heist"" were they planning? A ""major heist"" to get $1500 to pay off their rent. You call that ""major""?A terrible movie plot. Spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen but nothing does. Almost 2 hours of your life you will forever regret.",Kajillionaire

218,the_tornado,"Obscure, engaging, and thought provoking.",10,14 November 2020,"Definitely not a traditional film, rather an amazing melting pot of subplots. Rarely will you find a show that, can carry so many strings, and leave you sitting pondering before you leave the theater.",Kajillionaire
