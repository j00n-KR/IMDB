0,Leofwine_draca,Don't believe the hype,2,22 April 2016,"LOCKE is another one of those types of films that everybody raves about, then when you finally sit down to watch it, you realise it's a load of rubbish. And that's coming from somebody who's a fan of single location movies, and who finds the idea of a film featuring a guy inside his car for the entire duration to be something of a challenge.Unfortunately, as a 'thriller', this film falls flat because the plot is so trivial. Tom Hardy essays the role of an ordinary businessman whose life begins to fall apart thanks to some personal problems. The main issue is that said problems are completely unbelievable, not to mention making him a completely unsympathetic character. Some of us are forced to deal with far more stressful things in our everyday lives, so I found the whole thing to be rather pointless; when I found out this was the extent of the plot, I couldn't help but think 'is that it?'.Writer/director Steven Knight previously helmed the Jason Statham vehicle HUMMINGBIRD, which was much more interesting. Even further back, he used to write the screenplays for things like AMAZING GRACE and EASTERN PROMISES, so it's a shame to see him wasting his talent on material like this. I like Hardy and he does his best here, but I couldn't get past his accent, which weaves and tumbles like a drunken boxer in the ring. LOCKE is a waste of time unless you force yourself to enjoy arty movies that think they're a lot better than they are.",Locke
1,SnoopyStyle,Hardy proves his worth,7,11 November 2014,Foreman Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) races off his construction site on the eve of a historical concrete pour to attend his baby's birth. He had an one-time affair and had recently been contacted by the woman that she's having his child. He puts his family and career in danger. His family is expecting him home to watch a football game. His bosses are besides themselves and he's fired. He tries to help his assistant to take over the big job. It's an one-man movie as he drives in car and talk to various people on the phone.These one-man movies are alway fascinating to see the acting ability or lack thereof from the actor involved. This has a few interesting things. I like the drunken assistant. Rarely has a concrete pour been done more excitingly. The most important facade of the movie is Tom Hardy's performance. I've always thought that he's a good actor. This just solidified it. He hits all the right notes with his reserved manners and the inner turmoil underneath. He shows that he is a worthwhile actor.,Locke
2,Prismark10,The long road,7,19 August 2014,"Locke is a bottle drama written and directed by Steven Knight. Its completely set in a car and this low budget film was apparently filmed in just eight days and has just one sole star. Tom Hardy is Ivan Locke, a reliable construction manager who on the eve of a major project and his wife and children waiting at home to see a football match decides to take a journey to London.Locke had a one night stand and the lady got pregnant and is now going to the hospital as she is in labour. In so doing he has to confront his wife and boss with the truth, a brutal honesty that will spiral his life out of control where is on the verge of losing his job and family.Although Hardy with a Welsh accent is the only star, the story progresses by means of phone conversations with his wife, the mother of his child, his boss and work colleague. Locke tries to deal with issues at work with his hostile boss and desperate colleague who feels all at sea. Locke has to deal with his emotional wife, even more emotional mother to be as the labour gets more complicated.You wonder why Locke is doing this, why he is taking what looks like a drastic and a wrong course in his life but the film provides an answer by way of imaginary conversations with his father who had abandoned him and was absent for most of his life. Locke is determined to the right thing with this baby whatever the costs.There have been several recent bottle thrillers that have a few well known names and go straight to DVD in the USA. Here is a serious, honest to goodness straight drama reliant on Tom Hardy's acting performance, with a bushy beard, Welsh accent, he hits the right note, not overdoing it or being over emotional. Locke is a man known for his reliability, he is conscientious at work, he is a good husband and father but just made this one mistake.The film is efficiently directed by Knight and here the low budget and quick shooting benefits it, also plaudits to the composer for the music as its simplicity works so effectively.",Locke
3,nogodnomasters,YOU DON'T TRUST GOD WHEN IT COMES TO CONCRETE,4,12 September 2018,"The entire film takes place in a car. Not just bits and pieces, the whole thing. Locke (Tom Hardy) is driving to London to see the birth of his child by a one night stand. It will take him about 90 minutes, and like a Hemingway novel, it is done in real time. Ivan spends almost the entire trip on the phone and when he is not on the phone he talks to his deceased father.Ivan decides he needs to do the right thing by being at the birth of his child because of his poor relationship with his father. He imagines everything will be good afterwards. He takes calls from his son watching the football match. He has told his wife what has happened, and she is not dealing with it very well. The woman giving birth has issues as he talks to her and the hospital staff. Ivan is the foreman over a large concrete pour that will happen in his absence. He has to deal with corporate while micro managing a drinking worker through his job over the phone. He does so very cool and collectively, yet things don't go his way.The film never went anywhere. After 20 minutes or so in the car, I was groaning as I knew this was going to be another one man play. Fans of ""Vehicle 19"" or ""Buried"" should love this one too. Oh the drama.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",Locke
4,kosmasp,No turning back,8,23 September 2014,"Believe it or not, that is the German title of the movie. The actual title, I did not translate that. I guess they wanted to make sense of the word ""Locke"", so why not call your movie something or other. You obviously know where this is playing and the movie does not make you wonder, if there is a change in pace or not. The story is driven forward (sorry for the pun).It's sometimes weird hearing Tom Hardy speaking, because it sounds like his voice is breaking and he goes into Bane mode. Only if you've seen ""The Dark Knight rises"" obviously. He did an incredible job there and he's doing a phenomenal job here too. He has to here, because we are with him during his journey (again sorry). It's a movie for people who can digest little action in a confined space, while drama is going on .. everywhere. A neat and nice little movie, that is convenient at times with calls, but that is forgivable ...",Locke
5,blanche-2,a man's life spins out of control during a drive to London,7,17 June 2015,"Tom Hardy gives a magnificent performance as ""Locke,"" a 2013 film written and directed by Stephen Knight.This isn't the first time there has only been one person in a film -- Robert Altman's ""Secret Honor"" has Nixon talking into a tape recorder in a stream of consciousness. That was based on a play, and Nixon's was the only voice. In Locke, we only see Locke, but we hear the voices of other people over his car phone. The character is driving to London on the M6 and fielding a lot of phone calls. He has made the decision to be at the hospital for the birth of his illegitimate child and as a result, can't be at the huge concrete pour happening on his job, or at home with his wife and two sons watching a game on television. We watch Locke's life falling apart in 90 minutes, while he stays resolute in his decision, and also keeps his cool. He works with Donal (Andrew Scott), who is on site for the concrete pour, going over everything that has to be done and handling problems that come up as Donal prepares for the next day's action.He calms the expectant mother, a woman he hardly knows who become pregnant after a one-night stand. He confesses to his wife and talks to her throughout the drive, and also to his two sons. He reassures his boss about the concrete pour. He deals with the maternity unit at the hospital.Locke has made a decision that has impacted his job and home life, but he has done so to be a better man than his father, whom he talks to during the drive, although his father isn't there. He's someone everyone seems to depend on.The whole film depends on Hardy keeping our attention, and he does, with the only set being a car. A very absorbing drama without the usual bells and whistles, and refreshingly free of predictability or clichés.Very good and must be seen to be appreciated.",Locke
6,Theo Robertson,Radio With Pictures Without The Pictures,4,7 April 2015,"What drew me and undoubtedly a lot of other people to the film LOCKE was the concept - a film where the location is the inside of a car with one character . Minimalist isn't a good enough adjective but it's not the cynical art house minimalism of BLUE by Derek Jarman that belongs on radio or if you hold my view belongs in a bin but a character driven film where the story is carried by the protagonist speaking on the phone to multiple characters . Despite not sounding obviously cinematic it does have in its favour the well regarded and prolific Tom Hardy as the titular character and as I said the idea intrigued me and wondered how the idea would be carried off To be honest the reality is LOCKE should perhaps be in not on a cinema but in a theatre . It's a powerhouse performance by Hardy as you might expect but there's very little else to the movie apart from ""Man in a car finds his life collapsing around him"" . I thought perhaps there might be an element of a thriller as in ""Man gets a phone call from his wife that kidnappers have got her"" and this leads to a increasingly test film with a quite superb twist that left me reeling at the end . One wonders why Steven Knight didn't do that as a premise because the story as shown here is very one note and doesn't really go anywhere and there's nothing beyond the concept . So much so that by the time the end credits come up you'll be feeling cheated",Locke
7,CinemaSerf,Tom hardly puts a foot wrong...,7,9 August 2020,"There's no denying the intensity with which Tom Hardy plays ""Locke"" a married father and successful construction manager who abandons his work the night before a major project is to start, and drives down the motorway from Birmingham to London. En route, he spends much of his time on the phone to his family, his colleagues and his employer as he tries to explain to each (and us) why he is doing what he is doing; whilst also facing up - himself - to the ramifications of his actions. There are no other visible actors here; Olivia Colman, Andrew Scott, Ben Daniels et al all communicate by phone and that all helps build the tension of the almost real-time journey into a climax that demonstrates how good Hardy is at holding it all together using only his voice, his eyes, his mirrors, and a dimly lit car as his only props - and he does it well. Sadly, I found the writing not quite on the same level. The dialogue struggles to keep up with the pace and the potency of the imagery and given the magnitude of what he is going, some of the calls become irritatingly superfluous. That said, it holds the attention well for most of it's not quite 90 minutes and is well worth a watch.",Locke
8,zardoz-13,One Man/One Car,8,30 March 2016,"""Redemption"" writer & director Steven Knight has managed quite a feat with his gripping but claustrophobic 85-minute road-trip epic ""Locke,"" featuring Tom Hardy in what essentially amounts to a movie about a man alone driving to London at night. Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"") makes his living as a concrete construction engineer. The night before the biggest job of his life, our protagonist decides to abandon the project and drive to London to witness the birth of his son. The lady in question, however, is not his wife. Instead, she is a one-night stand that he met during a job seven months previously who struck him as ""sad"" and ""lonely"" and they slept together without any idea that she would get pregnant. Anyway, Locke has father issues with his own dad, and he is determined to get to London to greet his new son despite the ultra-important concrete pouring job at dawn the next day. Evidently, Locke's own father was not around for his birth and his absence at this seminal event has impacted Locke. Talk about a nightmare and that is precisely what Locke experiences during his otherwise uneventful evening road trip in his BMW as he juggles one call after another. When his supervisor Gareth (Ben Daniels) discovers that Locke will not be present to handle the difficult job of pouring concrete, Gareth fires him. Meantime, Locke has been conversing by telephone with Donal (Andrew Scott of ""Spectre""), a young assistant at the company who will oversee the pouring. They hash out last minute logistics when Locke isn't dealing with a hysterical Gareth who cannot believe that Locke is doing what he is doing. If this weren't bad enough, our protagonist must inform his unsuspecting wife, Katrina (Ruth Wilson), that he has had an affair with another woman. Katrina is shocked and warns Locke to not come home. At the same time, Locke winds up speaking to his sons who are ecstatic about a soccer match that Locke was supposed to watch with them. Locke also has conversations with Bethan (Olivia Coleman of ""Hot Fuzz"") who is struggling with her delivery. Ultimately, the doctors have to perform a Cesarean section because the infant has wrapped its umbilical cord around its neck. These conversations constitute the drama of ""Locke,"" and Locke himself seems virtually imperturbable until he learns to his chagrin that he has accidentally gone on the trip with important documents regarding the concrete job the following morning. ""Locke"" is not your ordinary movie. A movie that confines an audience in a car for its entire length doesn't sound too appetizing, but Tom Hardy's sterling performance and Steven Knight's masterful staging of this potentially lackluster event overcame any objections that I might have posed with it. Again, ""Locke"" is a one-man show with our protagonist contending with a number of individuals on his mobile telephone. Neither Hardy nor Knight resort to any melodramatic moments during the trip with incidents involving road rage, accident, an obnoxious driver, or a cop pulling him over for a motorist infraction. Like the title and the eponymous character that we come to admire for his resolve to do the right thing, ""Locke"" will keep you locked into his predicament through the drive.",Locke
9,george.schmidt,"Drive, He Said",8,9 May 2014,"LOCKE (2014) *** Tom Hardy gives a compelling performance in an essentially one-man film as a beleaguered construction foreman facing an imperative life force in one long drive to London : a one-time indiscretion resulting in an impending pregnancy with a delivery about to come to fruition all while balancing a very important delivery of concrete for a lucrative business venture. While filmmaker Steven Knight gives his leading man plenty of slack and some impressive monologues (and dialogues via blue tooth) the gimmick of a man in an imprisoned environment (his car) tends to wear on the nerves after awhile no matter how many cuts, camera angles and mood lighting to make things vaguely interesting.",Locke
10,neil-476,More of an interesting experiment than a gripping narrative,7,13 June 2014,"Welshman Ivan Locke is a senior concrete man who walks off the job on the eve of the biggest commercial pour in European history, in order to attend the birth of a child following a one-night stand. But he hasn't told his wife.For an hour and a half we accompany Locke as he drives from the site in Brighton to the hospital in London, and follow the developments in preparation for the pour early the next morning, the progress of labour at the hospital, and the impact of the news of his infidelity on his family, all by way of telephone calls. This mean that Tom Hardy, as Locke, is the only person on screen, although he gets sterling voice support from, among others, Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson and Tom Holland (11 other characters feature as voices on his phone).It is an interesting idea to set the entire film in and around Locke in his car during the drive, dealing with problems - for a strong character trait is that he is a problem solver - and the fairly extensive supporting cast helps enormously in widening out this small and intimate drama. Locke is an interesting character: almost unnaturally calm and composed to those he interacts with, but we learn that this is entirely a matter of self discipline as he also talks to his deceased father and lets out some of the inner turmoil which drives him.Tom Hardy is very, very good. The film kept me interested and is worth catching, although I had had enough of out of focus lights passing by the time it ended. I don't think I particularly want to see it again, though.",Locke
11,evanston_dad,Tom Hardy's Dark Night of the Soul,9,15 May 2014,"Tom Hardy gives a tremendous performance in ""Locke,"" a gimmick movie that rises above its gimmick to deliver a compelling examination of what it means to do ""the right thing."" Hardy is Ivan Locke, an unassuming man who's devoted to his job and his family. One dark night, instead of driving home to his wife and kids to watch a big game on T.V., he takes off on the 90 minute drive to London to take care of a ""mistake"" that he feels he needs to set right. The entire film takes place in his car with just him -- the only other actors are heard as voices on the phone that serves as Locke's only link to the outside world. During the course of his agonizing drive, he simultaneously explains to his wife what's going on, talks to the person he's on his way to see, and juggles the logistics of a major concrete pour scheduled to take place the next day. One mistake, and the decision to right that mistake, costs him everything he holds dear.Hardy is sensational as a man who we don't get to know that well yet feel like we know intimately by the time the film is over. He is a man consumed by the need to prove himself better, sturdier, more reliable, more THERE for the people in his life than his own dead beat dad. His journey is heartbreaking, because Locke is such a sympathetic character. Sure he messed up in a big way, but he's trying his hardest to adhere to his sense of duty, a task made even more difficult because it means hurting the people he loves who are left in his wake.Director Steven Knight struggles a bit with keeping his film visually interesting, and the roving camera and nearly constant slow dissolves in and out of Locke's car become more distracting than anything. And some conversations Locke has with his dead father would have worked better had they been presented as internal monologues rather than soliloquies spoken out loud. But these are minor faults in a movie that stays riveting thanks to Hardy. This film is far too small and has been released too early in the year to garner any awards attention, but if I were in charge of Oscar nominations, Hardy would already be a serious contender.The ending of this film is quietly striking -- Locke disappears into the night and the camera pans up to a busy expressway, making us wonder what other dramas are unfolding in these little isolated worlds speeding through the dark.Grade: A",Locke
12,ferguson-6,Do the Right Thing,7,15 April 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Most movies that take place in a confined space are outright thrillers that usually take full advantage of helpless feelings and desperate actions. Think back to Duel, Phone Booth and Buried. A ticking clock and lack of a safe escape route had us sweating bullets with Dennis Weaver, Colin Farrell and Ryan Reynolds. This entry from the Dallas International Film Festival takes a much different approach.Noted British writer Steven Knight also directs this one, and rather than nail-biting tension, we get a pretty interesting character study. Mr. Knight has written some impressive screenplays: Dirty Pretty Things, Amazing Grace, and Eastern Promises. Utilizing every ounce of his writing expertise, he keeps us connected to Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) as he drives on the freeway with intermittent rain being his biggest physical obstacle. There are no high speed chases. No stunts. No weapons. Ivan is not being followed by a spy or anyone else. He is merely driving and talking on the phone via Bluetooth.In what could be considered the ultimate film gimmick, Tom Hardy is the only actor to appear on screen. His Ivan Locke is not just the only major character. He is the ONLY one. All supporting work and conflict is provided by a multitude of voices on the other end of a phone call. There is no need for me to delve into the story or the plot, but you should know that the situation Ivan finds himself in is not some creative web of criminal deceit ... instead it's his penance for one poor decision. That poor decision has him in a tough spot with very poor timing.For those that wonder if Bane from The Dark Knight Rises has the acting chops to hold our attention, a reminder of Tom Hardy's fine work should alleviate concerns: Warrior, Inception, Lawless, Bronson, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. He can act and he can make a character his own, just as he does with Ivan Locke.",Locke
13,bombersflyup,"No, I'm going to drive straight to the worst place for me - the worst place on earth for me to be.",10,13 May 2019,"Locke has so much to like about it, it's never dull and quite thought provoking.I really appreciate these one location type films, with just a phone at hand. With a heightened state of urgency and intensity, with hostility, anger, resolve and heart of character. Ivan's a great guy despite his past action and the wife's also right to end it. The son's last call evidence that he's doing the right thing, that he's raised a good kid. Tom Hardy's certainly becoming a reliable choice when choosing a film. It does lack a fitting ending however and perhaps even a beginning.",Locke
14,FlashCallahan,Its a concrete jungle in there.....,8,24 August 2014,"You could imagine the look on the studios face when the idea for this film was pitched.'Yeah, it's about some Welsh fella who is driving to London to be at the birth of his child, but he's married, and there's a problem with some concrete'.Now on face value, you couldn't imagine this film doing anything for anybody, let alone pay to see a man driving for ninety minutes, we do enough of that already. But look deeper, and this is the story of a man who has obviously come from a bad childhood, and under no circumstances, will he follow in his fathers footsteps, even if it does mean his life will be left in tatters.In the past five years, everything Hardy has done, even if the film is a load of old cobblers like This Means War, has shown that he can out act everyone on screen, and here, it's literally just him, and a few phone calls.But what makes the film so interesting is the fact that he's chucking everything away for someone he hardly knows, someone he met on a business trip, because he knows deep down he has a responsibility for an unborn child, an innocent who needs a father in their life, as its clear that Locke never had that in his life.But then things go from bad to worse. There is a problem with his work, and even when the worst case scenario happens, he still helps a colleague, even when his unborn child is having a difficult birth and is at high risk, he is still there to talk to his teenage children.Hardy is superb in the titular role, using every emotion through out the film, but oddly remaining calm during his life changing journey.I can really understand why people are dismissing this as boring, but you really have to understand that this is more than a mans life going to ruins.Her is a man who is scared of turning into his own father, someone who obviously scarred him mentally, and Locke knows its so easy to fall into that path, because he already has his father psyche in him, just like Pavlov's salivating dog.So its one just a literal journey for Locke, its a psychological one also, and the final scene is beautiful.",Locke
15,deloudelouvain,Tom Hardy goes solo,7,23 February 2015,"Okay, if you would have told me before I watched this movie that the whole movie is about a guy in a car making and receiving phone calls I probably would have said that I'm not going to watch that. But I didn't knew so I watched it and I'm not disappointed I did. This movie is the perfect example that minimalistic cinema can also work and that you don't need an extremely high budget to deliver a good movie. Tom Hardy is the only visible actor and he did a great job. The other actors are just voices on the phone so you can't really judge them because all they did was probably reading their lines. In fact it was all well done and it kept you interested during the whole movie. A different but not bad movie.",Locke
16,Mr-Fusion,An intriguing concept . . .,6,15 December 2014,"The idea behind LOCKE is a novel one (a one-man show moving the plot along through various phone conversations on a car ride) but the ride isn't a satisfying one. Minimalist to be sure (Hardy's is the only face we get to see in the whole film), the entire thing rests on Hardy making one phone call after the next during a frantic night's drive. A few shots outside the car aside, that's it: just one actor in a car. It might just be me, but I couldn't shake an element of claustrophobia for most of the running time. I wanted to see more of this guy's life than we're privy to; see some of these faceless characters, get an idea what life is like for him when he's not speeding towards certain fate. But we're stuck in the car. I know that's what the movie offers - to see a life unravel in such a short time - and that's fine, but I readily admit to wanting more.That said, it all rests on Hardy's shoulders, and he does convey the angst, stress and weariness of this guy. Beautifully so. It's absolutely worth it for his performance. Just not a ride I feel like taking again.6/10",Locke
17,namashi_1,Compelling!,9,31 October 2014,"'Locke' is a film made with tremendous conviction. Making a film centered around just 1 single character, who's in his car throughout, & yet not making you feel the need of others, is a rare cinematic achievement. Writer-Director Steven Knight drives 'Locke' with magnificent speed & solid writing.'Locke' Synopsis: Ivan Locke, a dedicated family man and successful construction manager, receives a phone call on the eve of the biggest challenge of his career that sets in motion a series of events that threaten his careful cultivated existence.Another prime reason why 'Locke' never runs out of gas, is its leading man, Tom Hardy, who takes up the challenge to lead a film where he's solely around without anyone showing up. And Hardy, expectedly, delivers a towering performance as Locke. He is fierce, guilty, courageous & also blunt in his portrayal of a man, who's haunted by his past & his own demons. Hardy has done remarkable work before, but his turn in 'Locke' certainly stands out.I enjoyed 'Locke' because it was successful in its intension. Its a challenging film to make, and to their credit, they pretty much have nailed it. Watch It!",Locke

It keeps you guessing as with time thru conversation the plot builds up really without no big climax or stunning scenes. Starring Tom Hardy(Bane from ""Batman"")as Ivan Locke a successful construction boss who has a wife and children and he thinks everything is just fine on his journey home. However on this night things change as with phone call after phone call everything seems different and not the same, as soon secrets and shocking events will be revealed and discovered that really have Ivan in deep thought as these new dramas could change the course path of not only his ride but his life.

19,lasttimeisaw,Hardy's one-man-show,6,27 September 2014,"This is Tom Hardy's one-man-show, in a literary sense, the entire film is exclusively shot in a car while he is driving to London at night, and taking successive phone calls (thanks to the convenient Bluetooth technology) and trying to keep his life from tearing apart. And it is all because that he believes he is correcting his wrongs by making the right choice, even the risk is that he will lose everything he has, a well-paid job, a rosy career and a perfect family.No one can deny this mini-budgeted indie fare has its winsome novelty in its daring structural frame, and totally banks on Hardy's masculine charisma and empathetic performance to entrance audience in 85 minutes of conversing by phone without the aid of any bells and whistles. A typical cinematic machination, against all odds, it is one night dramatically encapsulated all the important matters for the construction site foreman Ivan Locke (Hardy), tomorrow he is duly to supervise one of the largest concrete pouring in Europe, yet in this particular moment, a woman named Bethan (Colman) is delivering a baby at London, and Ivan is the father. So in a split-second change of mind, instead of driving home to enjoy a football match with his family, he decides to drive to London and take on his responsibility of his one-night-stand affair. While, he has to transfer the pouring to his less-competent college Donal (Scott) who has a drinking problem (with ciders), face the blame from his boss Gareth (Daniels), who is referred as the bastard, in the name list of the phone, meanwhile he also has to come clean to his unwitting wife Katrina (Wilson) and console Bethan in the hospital, who is in need of a Cesarean section. Fortunately, the minimalism strategy works sufficiently to amp up a feature-length streak, Tom Hardy is a massively formidable attention-grabber, the full spectrum of his emotional journey is incredibly delivered in the monotonous driving process, he is so close to acquire an Oscar nomination only if he has more to showcase instead of being wholly confined behind the wheel. The voice cast is foresee-ably serviceable, the standout is Andrew Scott (the limelight-stealing Jim Moriarty in SHERLOCK series), whose conversion throughout the film is so graphically enthralling although we never have the chance to see his character while, the rest of them are plainly predictable, sometimes they are dangerously tantamount to clichéd annoyance. Director Steven Knight is an accomplished screen writer (notably for his Oscar-nominated DIRT PRETTY THINGS 2002, 8/10 and EASTERN PROMISES 2007, 7/10), but in the director's chair, he cleverly sidesteps the formality and laborious endeavor and displays a well-written melodrama in full throttle, if not too much contrived in its straightforward face-value (e.g. Ivan's condemnation of his dead father is an awkward overkill to emphasize his determined motivation). On a whole, LOCKE is interesting in its creation, with one Oscar-worthy performance and a sappy and uninspired moral tale.",Locke
20,KineticSeoul,Tom Hardy drives this film,7,17 August 2014,"This is film that isn't for everyone. As a matter of fact, I think most mainstream audience members are gonna be bored or think this movie is a waste of time and a whole bunch of nothing. However, certain people that may have some experience behind them, just might appreciate a movie of this caliber. For me this movie was immersive and even captivating during certain parts. Watching this movie was like watching a man driving through the night hours trying to figure things out when it comes to his exterior circumstances and inner demons. As a matter of fact, kind of like the movie buried is taken place with a person in a box throughout the whole movie. This film has a guy talking on a phone throughout the whole movie within the confines of a car. And no, there are no stunt works with the car, it's just simply a guy talking on a phone while driving. A movie like this really needs two things to make it watchable and that is good enough dialogue that may intrigue the audiences and good acting. If not, it could have been a complete disaster. And let me tell you Tom Hardy really drives this film and not just because he is the only character present one screen throughout the whole movie. Hardy actually decided to go with a welsh accent throughout this film, because of the calming tone and way of speaking that can be integrated to the character. This is actually a element that adds a lot to the character and the situation. A understandable psychological aspect of this movie is another element that drives this film. Of a character that has integrity and honest way of doing things could be driven by other factors as well, such as not wanting to be a carbon copy of someone you loath. This is a enthralling film that is worth at least one watch, I probably won't be seeing this film again. But for one watch, it was worth it.7.6/10",Locke
21,Hellmant,That's an amazing actor!,9,5 June 2014,"'LOCKE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Tom Hardy gives an amazing one-man show performance in this indie drama about a construction manager driving, from Birmingham to London, to see his illegitimate child's birth. The film all takes place in the construction worker's car, with Hardy talking to other characters on the phone. It was written and directed by Steven Knight; who's famous for writing crime dramas like 'EASTERN PROMISES', 'DIRTY PRETTY THINGS' and 'REDEMPTION' (which is the only other movie he's directed). The flick reminds me a lot of another one-man film, called 'BURIED' (from 2010), starring Ryan Reynolds. That's a great movie as well, with another excellent leading man performance, but this film is even better!Hardy plays Ivan Locke; a construction foreman who lives in Birmingham with his wife, Katrina (Ruth Wilson), and two sons. As the movie begins he's just learned that a former co-worker, named Bethan (Olivia Colman), has just gone into premature labor, with his child. Ivan had a one-night stand with the woman, several months earlier, while working with her in London. While driving home, to watch a football game with his family, he decides to drive to London (at the last minute) to be with Bethan when the baby is born. He also blows off an important concrete pour (the next day) and communicates with a co-worker and his boss, about it, on the drive (via phone). At the same time he also talks to his wife, and sons (Tom Holland and Bill Milner), about his current situation (for the first time). We learn that being there, for his new child, is very important to Ivan (because his dad was never there for him). He talks to his dead father, multiple times, on the drive as well; demonstrating some degree of mental illness (caused by his father's abandonment). The movie is labeled (and has been advertised) as both a drama and a thriller. It is very intense but despite the question of the main character's level of sanity it's not really something I'd call a thriller. It's very involving, and emotionally suspenseful, though because it totally wraps you up in it's character's drama. The script is brilliant, and Knight's directing perfectly applies the right atmosphere to it, but it's Hardy that really makes the movie work. He's always impressive in everything he does (he's my favorite actor currently) but when he picks a really good project he's brilliant. This is one of those movies. I read he filmed all his scenes in 6 days and one take; while the voice actors filmed all their scenes in a hotel room (talking to Hardy on a phone). That's an amazing actor! If you're a fan of his, and experimental movies, you'll definitely enjoy this flick.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpJHaK5PsZc",Locke
22,thesar-2,Locked In,7,9 May 2015,"I do like those small, independent and claustrophobic films, and this film certainly fits the bill. We literally follow a troubled construction family man as he uses up many phone minutes while on the drive to London. Our job as viewers is to put the pieces together of his life outside his vehicle through said phone calls. Hardy held his own – he is an established and good-looking actor, though I may never agree with his Bane, but the additional Dad story was just dumb. I understand where they were going and they needed some filler, I guess, from just the three conflicts this guy had on his long drive, but it was unnecessary and frankly, a distraction. But, overall, I loved getting involved in his conversations and how he was trying to juggle many conflicts. Worth a watch for movie-(and Hardy)-lovers.",Locke
23,FeastMode,my notes,2,20 July 2019,"This is one of the most pointless movies i've eve watched. completely useless. i wanted to punch the screen when it finished. when it was nearing the end i kept thinking, please be something more, but nope, and at that point i felt like i just wasted my time on this garbo movie. (1 viewing)SPOILERSi randomly thought of an alternate ending that would have been crazy and awesome. imagine if after everything that happened in the movie, he gets to the hospital and she calls him while he's still in the car and tells him it was a miscarriage. that would have been insane lol the final shot that seemed to imply that he wasn't going to the hospital and was going the abandonment route was okay i guess, but i was wondering that way earlier, probably like half-way thru the movie, so it did not surprise me at all",Locke
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Jettisons it's mystery angle a little too early, but still a very intense, involving effort",9,24 April 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIvan Locke (Tom Hardy) is in a managerial position at a construction company, and is about to pull off a massive deal that could make him big time. But that will have to wait, along with his commitments to his wife and children, as Ivan has another responsibility that has him in his car, driving up the motorway, destined to a situation that he must attend to, no matter what.Never are we more harshly and unforgivingly faced with our own private hell than when we find ourselves confined in some tiny space we can't get out of, like in a car on a busy motorway, heading towards something that cannot be ignored and must be taken care of. Steven Knight, the Eastern Promises scribe, has applied his unique talent to a screenplay about a mysterious man, shrouded in an air of mystery as to where he is driving and what for, that is revealed maybe a bit too early and loses some crucial intrigue as a result, but thanks to a strong central (and only, in fact) performance and strong writing, never loses it's way.This kind of high concept, outside the box approach to story telling, featuring just one character talking via blue tooth throughout, is a daring and innovative way to convey the story and works wonders in the right hands, such as Knight, who never lets it sag. While Hardy grapples with real life verbal confrontations with those at home and those at work, he also indulges in imaginary showdowns with his hallucinatory father, whose selfish, responsibility shirking actions he is determined to avoid. It is, in effect, a film about a man who is committed and determined as he can be to do the right thing, no matter what harsh realities he has to confront and no matter how much rebuilding he will have to do afterwards. It's an offbeat, offtrack effort that is gaining the cult ravings this type of film tends to get, and for the most part is quite deserving of them, a fully charged, electrifying character study if not the riveting thriller it could have been. ****",Locke
25,paul2001sw-1,You can't engineer a life,8,6 May 2016,"Steven Kinght's film 'Locke' tells the story of a methodical engineer, basically a good man, whose life falls apart when he faces a situation (uncharacteristally of his own making) to which his innate ultra-rationalism can offer no solution. The film's uniqueness comes from the fact that the drama unfolds entirely in a series of phone-calls he has while driving. It's somewhat manufactured with a predictability to the narrative arc, and Locke's self-contained nature is intrinsically anti-dramatic, as is the confined setting (Locke is the only character we see on screen throughout the entire film). But the script is impeccable, Tom Hardy plays the part perfectly, and (surprisingly, but appropriately for a film about the construction industry) this is a riveting movie.",Locke
26,bowmanblue,Know what you're getting yourself in for,5,31 August 2014,"I didn't like 'Locke,' but I'm pretty sure that it's my fault I didn't. First of all, I don't watch films at the cinema, only on DVD. Then, if a film has an actor/theme etc that I like, I'll watch it without really finding out what it's about. I think this was a major mistake with Locke.I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy and will watch him in pretty much anything since I first saw him in Star Trek 10 (yes, I was a fan even before he put his 'Bane' mask on). And, if you check out the various quotes on the front of the poster for Locke, you'll see things like 'An outstanding thriller.' Well, that was enough to get me to watch it without even bothering to find out what was contained within the film.I expected a tense, thrill ride, jam-packed with action and car chases. At least I got the car.The film is actually about one man (yes, just a single man for an hour and twenty minutes). Tom Hardy plays a man (called 'Locke' believe it or not) who is driving from his home in Wales to London to be with a woman (not his wife I should point out) who is about to give birth to his child. The entire film therefore takes place in the car with him at the wheel, as he talks to various people over the phone, i.e. his wife (who is none too happy about this) and his business associates (who are equally unhappy about him abandoning them on the eve of a major contract).And there you have it nearly an hour and a half of a man talking on his car phone. Now, I'm not saying that it's not tense, nor badly-acted. Tom Hardy is excellent (as always) and this is basically a one-man play which highlights just how good an actor he really is. However, thrilling it isn't. I get what the film-makers are trying to do, i.e. slowly cranking up the tension as the journey continues, but it just didn't work for me.Maybe it was because I was expecting something completely different. I know it's my fault. If you bother to check out other reviews/internet message boards (which I obviously didn't!) you'll find this quite clearly stated.So, know what you're getting in for with this film. It's probably quite good if you're in the mood for a minimalistic little slow-burner. I'll probably watch it again sometime when I'm in the mood for something a little more subtle. In the meantime, I'll stick to watching Tom snapping Batman's back like a twig.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Locke
27,ThomasDrufke,A Quiet But Spellbinding Drama,8,29 September 2014,"Tom Hardy is one of the few actors that I will see anything he is in. He is among the best actors working today and his performance as Ivan Locke is absolutely mesmerizing. It's only an 80 minute film, and it's only Hardy driving a car the whole time, but yet it's one of the most gripping movies I have seen this year. Locke does what all movies set out to do. It captures your attention from beginning to end in a unique and memorable way. Hardy gives what is likely his best performance of his career.It tells the story of a well accomplished businessman man who has everything. A great job, good friends, a loving family, but slowly his perfect life trickles away in one long car ride filled with life changing phone calls. Hardy is calm and chilling for the first 30 minutes or so but just as the phone calls become more alarming, he loses his demeanor.This film isn't a thriller. It wont shock you in any form, but it is eye opening. Ivan Locke is a concrete pourer and cares a bit too much about his job. This film shows that just as one mistake in concrete pouring can destroy an entire job, a personal decision Locke made may destroy his entire life as he knows it. The most fascinating part about this film is that Hardy isn't given a lot of room to work as an actor. He is in the car for the entire film, but his ability to show many different emotions, and give the audience the true sense of despair is unparalleled. It's films like this that give us glimpses of how great a film can be when it's simple and doesn't try to do too much. This isn't my favorite film of the year but there really isn't anything wrong with it. It reassures us of Hardy's acting chops (if you needed reassurance) and gives us an example of what director Steven Knight can do.+Hardy's demeanor +Simple but yet so intriguing +Short but thought provoking +Gutsy 8.5/10",Locke
28,g-bodyl,Tom Hardy's One Man Show!,9,25 March 2015,"Locke is one of the few original films to hit the Cineplex these days, and this movie already receive points for that notion. Not only is this film original, it is also quite unique. The film that only has one actor on screen and in one setting still manages to be interesting and quite captivating. The execution of this unique premise is well-done and it manages to be thrilling and it make you want to know what happens next. The film's resolution is not the greatest, all because I did not want the film to end.Steven Knight's film is about a man named Locke who is a construction manager. We see him leaving the site the evening before a major project to take a two-hour drive to London because of an unforeseen event. This drive culminates in an ultimate showdown between himself and loved ones.This is Tom Hardy's show and he ultimately delivers a very strong performance, although his accent was somewhat questionable at times. But we can feel his emotions, whether he deserves them or not, and we just hope for the best out of him.Overall, Locke is a very good film and I found this to be a unique, surreal film because of the premise. I love how these kind of movies can be made as they push films to the next level. This film is not meant to be complex, but in a way it is. The simplicity of the movie requires much focus just to keep the viewers entertained, and I feel this film did a good job in doing so, even though it is basically a man driving a car.My Grade: A-",Locke
29,lesleyharris30,"Unique Film, albeit Underwhelming,",7,5 June 2016,"Locke is a good movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's a truly unique 90 minutes as we follow Ivan Locke on his way to the hospital after his girlfriend goes in to labor, it was a risky, bold move to have it all set in the car as Ivan receives various phone calls that are significant to his character development. With a set up as complicated as this you need a great actor to hold it all together, and Tom Hardy manages to sustain the emotional of Locke, while keeping the audiences attention, for the entire duration. However, I did feel the film did not completely deliver its potential, Ivan does not react to the information the phone callers are giving him enough, which almost feels like he's rejecting plot development, seeing him just sitting there and talking, albeit very natural, can get tiresome as he is not expressing enough. As well as that, as the calls progress, it becomes harder to sympathise with Ivan, the main character does not always have to be likable, but when they are the only person you see in the whole movie, they probably should. While it has its flaws, Locke is unlike any other movie I have ever seen, and it is worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama. A construction manager's life begins to fall apart as he engages in numerous phone calls while driving to the hospital. Best Performance: Tom Hardy",Locke

One complicated character and 5-6 situations that happens on the phone while on the road to a new life.

32,Reno-Rangan,The time when Donkey becomes Horse & vice versa.,7,17 December 2014,"Obviously it reminds Paul Wlaker's 'Vehicle 19' for anyone who had watched it. Both the stories take place inside a moving car. But the only difference is the different genres, thus plots deviates. One was a thriller and another one is a drama. The concept was a good one and of course low budget movie with a high quality output. Especially the story was so interesting. The three sets of characters that connected to the movie's main character Ivan Locke played by Tom Hardy. The camera angles were limited that probably restricted to 4 to 5 numbers. And completely whole scenario takes place in the dark time in around the 2 hour span real time.Performances wise, there's nothing to praise greatly as everything happens in a stillness. But the expressions and the voices rendered were the highlight. Except Tom Hardy the remains were like Scarlett Johansson from the movie 'Her'. If you see, the story in which the dialogues involved through telephone conversation were the typical and predictable. But the way they used to tell it was made all the difference in here. The movie completely reveals the main character whose family and professional lives begins to take a rough road when he decides to correct his mistake. Kind of unleashes how men stabilized his personal life and job affairs together.''You make one mistake, one little mistake, the whole world comes crashing down around you.''Very much satisfied with the movie. Kind of refreshing from the regular entertainment dramas. If you watch, sorry, if you hear this movie without the visuals you won't find any difficulties to understand. Because all you can give best shot to get it is to paying close attention by listening the phone conversations which covers 90% of the movie. Something like an audio book and you will generate your own images throughout. Most of the people in the world do not prefer drama films, they want fast paced entertainment. But if you have no objection for giving a try for experimental presentations, then here it is that you must not skip it and liked it or not comes afterwards.",Locke
33,sol-,Locke Stock,7,10 May 2017,"Wanting ""to do the right thing"" for the first time in his life, a construction manager takes a lengthy nighttime drive to the hospital where a woman he impregnated is giving birth while awkward phone conversations (and chats with his father's ghost) threaten his sanity in this daringly different film. An odd cutaway or two aside, the camera stays fixed in the car the whole time with Tom Hardy rising to the challenge of keeping his character interesting when he is the only human being we see throughout. There are curiously two impending births at hand with Hardy spending half his conversations on technical details about the skyscraper he was constructing and which we gradually see he values more than his own family. While the Welsh accent that he adopts is occasionally distracting, Hardy does well throughout remaining calm under pressure. Whenever talking with his wife, son or the woman he impregnated, he never loses his cool or becomes emotional, and yet in the brief moments when he is not on the phone, forced to converse with his father's ghost, we see more and more of the cracks in his levelheaded outer shell. Promising as all this might sound, the novelty does wear thin quickly and Hardy's character is hardly the most likable human being in the world, so one's patience here might vary, but this is a refreshingly different sort of emotional roller-coaster at the very least.",Locke
34,tomgillespie2002,Often gripping stuff,7,15 September 2014,"Ever been stuck on a motorway at night, anxious to reach your destination, and with the sounds of ""are we there yet?"" running through your mind? Locke is a British drama by director/screenwriter Steven Knight, the man responsible for Dirty Pretty Things (2002) and Eastern Promises (2007) which takes place entirely in the miserable setting of the M1, and in fact never, with the exception of the opening minute or so, leaves it's protagonist's car. It could easily be dismissed as a narrative trick, a gimmick films often use to elevate it's dull story. But the claustrophobic and dreary setting serves a purpose, a portal into the mind of it's eponymous hero, charismatically performed by the magnetic Tom Hardy, in what is surely his best performance.On the night before Europe's largest-ever concrete pour (outside of military and nuclear projects), construction foreman Ivan Locke (Hardy) throws his hi-vis and boots into his BMW, and sets off on what will turn out to be a traumatic journey from Birmingham to London. His boss, saved in Locke's phone as 'B*****d', is p****d at Locke for abandoning his post, and duly fires him. Determined not see his work fall apart, he stays in touch with Irish friend Donal (Andrew Scott), who carries out Locke's instructions. He also has news for his wife (Ruth Wilson), who is waiting with his children to watch an important football match. Armed with just Bluetooth and his beloved work binder, it will be a night that sees Locke's carefully constructed world fall apart.It's hard to describe the plot without revealing too much. Locke's situation lacks originality and complexity, but the film holds your attention with the way the many phone calls he makes slowly begin to claw away at a man whose life, until now, has been a well- constructed success. Such a confined narrative structure demands a great performance, and Hardy, shedding the hard-man persona he developed in the likes of Bronson (2008) and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), delivers it with aplomb. With nowhere for the camera to go apart from the occasional glimpse of the road, Hardy holds the screen throughout. Some things don't quite work, such as Locke talking to his dead father (a moment that reeks of lazy exposition), but for a film about a man in a car talking on the phone to people we never see, it's often gripping stuff.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Locke
35,Floated2,Hardy delivers a performance turning,8,4 October 2015,"Locke starring Tom Hardy as the only visible character in the film. Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, a family man and construction-site foreman specializing in concrete. He leaves work, drives off, stops at a red light. It turns green, his turn signal blinks left, he hesitates, a truck behind him honks, he switches the signal and goes right. In his mind, it's the literal right thing to do. The rest of the narrative occurs in the car over a couple hours or so as Ivan drives, making the necessary phone calls in the wake of this decision.Rather disturbed by several different opinions on this film, many people seem to miss the condescending point. The metaphor is clear, rather obvious, but brilliant: forward motion, the act of literal transition, to represent the character's change. It's set in one location– the driver's seat of a BMW – but also no location, and many locations, because the car is always in motion. His career and marriage are both at stake. When he finally stops, turns off the engine and gets out of the car, his life may be completely different. The ending is quite clear on the decision he makes yet people seem to think otherwise. Quite a film where one must pay very close attention to detail. Don't expect any twists, turns or anywhere out of the blue. The premise is very clear.",Locke
36,eddie_baggins,A writing masterclass with an outstounding performance from Hardy,8,7 September 2014,"For Locke's true power as a film to sink in you will need a few days to sit and ponder upon its small yet intricate construction, for in a film that is set almost entirely within the confines of one man's car, Locke deals with many an issue and does so by uncorking a powerhouse Tom Hardy performance and a downright believable script by Brit Steven Knight who here makes up for his dreary directing debut Hummingbird.There will be many out there that have no time for Locke due to its setup and in a way this is not an unjust decision by them for Locke requires much of you as a viewer and does not look to find a way around this. Not perhaps since Ryan Reynolds found himself in a tight situation in Rodrigo Cortes 2010 film Buried has a film relied so heavily on the audience to bear with it and a performer to hold our attention with nothing more than a phone (or Bluetooth) to act alongside with. Locke's tightly focused pacing and realistic scripting are both hugely successful but it is in the performance of Hardy that the film finds its true power and ability to stick with you days after release.Oft cast as the hulking or manic presence within a film as seen in any of Warrior, The Dark Knight Rises or Bronson, Hardy hear is a steely at times inwardly reserved Ivan Locke, a man whose world is crumbling around him despite being sheltered by his luxury ride. Playing Locke with a welsh accent and with a vulnerability within both his eye, Hardy showcases a rarely displayed side to his acting talents that Knight uncovers to great effect. Whether Locke is demanding or pleading, Hardy is in control even though his character is slowly but surely crumbling from within. It's one of the year's best acting turns, unflashy yet utterly commanding, Hardy achieves more with a singly look than some actors do within an entire role. It's worth also mentioning the voice work (the only other people you will hear during the entire movie, no one else is ever seen) of the cast here in Locke, from Olivia Colman through to The Impossible's Tom Holland as Locke's son Eddie, all voice performers give soul to the voices we hear on the phone.A movie to be watched in the tightest surrounds available to you, Locke isn't an easy watch due to its setting and not a movie made for overall public consumption. Locke is however an incredibly smart and well-constructed film that is the perfect showcase for the increasing acting prowess of Tom Hardy, an actor that continues to stake a claim as one of if not the most interesting and diverse performers in the business today.4 Bluetooth calls out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Locke
37,leonblackwood,Great intense drama! 7/10,7,31 August 2014,"Review: Although this movie is based around conversations on a car phone, for some unknown reason, it's actually quite good. It wouldn't have been entertaining at all if it wasn't for Tom Hardy who really did bring emotion and intensity to his role. The concept was original and very realistic and the director done well by making such a simple idea, entertaining. You really do end up feeling for the main character who is having problems at work and has problems with his personal life after one bad mistake. Everyone in everyday life can relate to this movie and I'm sure that people would have there own personal views about the decisions that were made by the main character. After watching the making of the movie, it was great to see that the director actually made the conversations real and that he didn't go down the easy route by making recordings of the voices. Anyway, in all, I enjoyed this short by sweat movie which has many twists and turns throughout. Enjoyable!Roundabout-Up: I really didn't know what to expect from this movie because all of the adverts were just showing Tom Hardy driving in a car and now that I've seen the film, I can understand why. The only different scenes in the film is when he's getting in the car right at the beginning, but apart from that the whole film is really based in his car on the phone. I couldn't see this film working without Tom Hardy who is just brilliant throughout the movie. I can't wait to see him in Splinter Cell and with movies like The Dark Knight and Inception under his belt, things can only get better for this Londoner.Budget: $2million Worldwide Gross: $4.6million I recommend this movie to people who are into there intense dramas about a man in a troubled relationship and whose got problems at work which he has to sort out on the phone in his car on the way to London. 7/10",Locke
38,howard.schumann,"Hypnotic, thought-provoking, and ultimately exhilarating",10,11 May 2014,"People make mistakes, especially when they are young; however, it takes a big person to acknowledge them and do what it is necessary to set things right. While ""doing the right thing"" can indeed go a long way towards regaining self-respect, it always has to be balanced with how it will affect others. Just ask Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) in Steven Knight's riveting film simply called Locke. Ivan is a foreman for a construction company for ten years whose Chicago-based company is getting ready for the concrete pouring of one of the biggest building projects in their history.His boss Gareth (Ben Daniels), his assistant Donal (Andrew Scott), and others in his crew expect him to be there the next morning to oversee the project - to verify that the right concrete is being used, arrange for all the roadblocks, and to take care of any emergencies that may come up. ""You can't rely on God when it comes to concrete,"" he tells Donal. Ivan, however, is not coming home and he cannot rely on God to clean up the mess he is in the process of making. His decision is to be with 42-year old Bethan (Olivia Coleman), a woman he knew for only one night but who is now in the hospital about to give birth to his child.Knowing from experience with his deceased dad (who he talks to during the drive) what it feels like to be abandoned by someone, he has made his decision and, though others have trouble dealing with it, he is committed to the choice he has made regardless of the consequences. On paper, Steven Knight's Locke does not seem designed to hold the viewer's interest. There is only one man on camera throughout the entire length of the film. It all takes place on a rainy night inside of a car, and the only dialogue consists of telephone conversations during the trip. What looks one way on paper, however, on the screen turns out to be a totally different experience.In Locke, Knight, who wrote the screenplay for Eastern Promises and Dirty Pretty Things, delivers a tense, absorbing film about the choices we make in life and how we are often unprepared for their consequences. Far from being static or one-dimensional, Hardy brings such life to his character that the experience is mesmerizing as he becomes more and more deeply involved in sorting out his life. A very dependable family man, Locke's wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) and his two boys Eddie and Shaun (Tom Holland and Bill Milner) expect him to be home to watch a big soccer match with them as he promised.During the 85-minute drive to the hospital at night, Ivan has to talk his frazzled assistant Donal through the steps necessary to have the project work in addition to calming a distraught Bethan, handling his son's disappointment, and dealing his wife's rigidly unforgiving reaction. ""The difference between never and once is the difference between good and evil,"" she tells him. In Hardy's nuanced performance, Ivan is not an irresponsible scoundrel, but a three-dimensional human being, like most of us part saint and part sinner, who feels that he is acting out of integrity and expects everyone to understand.Through it all, he is the only one who remains calm but the events are testing his patience and the pain can be read on his face. With a strong, confident tone delivered in a beautifully enunciated Welsh accent, he reassures Donal that he can handle the responsibility of the project even though he has begun to drink, and he lets Katrina know that he loves no one else beside her. He tells the boys that he will explain tomorrow and that everything can be fixed and things will return to normal, but whether he is being practical or delusional is left for the viewer to decide.Hardy's performance holds our attention throughout and Knight's deft and gimmick-less direction plus the gorgeous cinematography of Haris Zambarloukos transforms Locke into what might have been a desultory, claustrophobic experience into one that is hypnotic, thought-provoking, and ultimately exhilarating.

39,TheMovieDiorama,Locke precariously drives down the road of crushing solitude.,7,29 October 2019,"Concrete. A highly versatile construction material that harnesses strength and durability as aspects of its properties. Impact and fire resistant. A common element for brutalist architecture. And just like the eponymous construction foreman, all it takes is for one mistake. The most minuscule of errors, before an erected building collapses. Unable to withstand the misjudgement of its foundations. Locke, as he drives his tissue-littered BMW X5 from Birmingham to London, must confront unintentional accidents that have caused his mentality to inadvertently spiral out of control.A one night stand with Colman as she gives birth to a miscalculated oversight. Consequently causing Locke to abruptly depart for the hospital, resulting in his job dismissal and a construction company spending millions more on a building that has yet to come to fruition. Confronting his own family, showcasing honesty in the most desperate of situations. An hour and a half drive (""as fast as the traffic will allow""). Thirty six phone calls. A life dissolving in the confinement's of one location. He had everything. Security. Family. Shelter. Only for them to be removed by signalled communications in the luxury of his BMW.Knight illustrates the power of simplicity. No flashy visualised distractions. No abrupt editing mechanics. No action. The thrills, tension and drama stem from a screenplay that has its extremities tested by consistently filming in real-time. Allowing the dialogue to be the only aspect at the forefront. We witness an individual deal with the stresses of life. Both professional and personal. Examining the moralities of a man who strives to differ from his irresponsible father. But his wife's rebuttal is an opaque sentiment that challenges forgiveness. ""The difference between never and once is the difference between good and bad"". An eternally resonant message that self-drives this car journey into the realms of virtuosity.Knight's purposeful choice of enhancing the claustrophobic environment complements the depiction of Locke's world, as he knows it, swirling in on him. Reducing the boundaries of his breathing space. His stress and anxiety heightening with each phone call he receives. However, none of the above would've been as effective if it wasn't for Hardy's exceptionally tantalising performance. Far from a car crash, he manages to centralise the focus on him with the camera rarely moving away from his bloodshot eyes or fatigued face. His desperation and intrusive responses illustrates loneliness on a more empathetic wavelength.Despite the act of adultery, you never view Locke as an antagonistic entity. He does his best to find ""the next practical step"" whilst retaining the thoughts of the recipients in his own head. It's relatable, personally, on a level that cancels out the background noise. And that, is a powerful dramatic endeavour.There are a few bumps on the motorway though. The various scenes where Locke talks to himself, as if he's talking to his father, were somewhat cumbersome techniques in order to convey his opposing stance to his father that still haunts him. It's not particularly subtle, and contrasts heavily with the dramatic phone calls. A desperate attempt to convey abandonment, which would've been alleviated by a simple phone chat instead. It's not shot in one take, and so editor Wright embeds scenes of traffic and the bright luminescence of roads to segregate the narrative flow. These occur too frequently and conceives an occasional irregular pace. And the maternity nurse wasn't particularly helpful by constantly spluttering ""she's afraid"" whilst Locke clearly stated he was on his way. Give the man a break!Despite these bumps, Locke is a smooth drive with dramatic heft and cinematic experimentalism. An irony of a construction worker having his life demolished in minutes. Testing an individual's moralities through a variety of stress-inducing situations, culminating into an illustration on solidarity. Hardy confidently drives the plot to its desired destination, ""speed limits"" included.",Locke
40,l_rawjalaurence,The Destruction of a Family Man's World in Just One Night,7,11 April 2016,"Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) experiences a thoroughly bad day (or should it be a night) at the office. Driving down to London to be with his pregnant ex-lover Bethan (Olivia Colman) at the maternity hospital, he has to tell his wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) the truth about his sexual exploits, while dealing with a series of crises at work involving the delivery of a huge amount of cement to a building-site as preparation for the construction of another skyscraper. In the end Ivan ends up losing family and job, but at least he has become a father once more.Shot entirely in and around Ivan's car as it speeds down the freeway, Stephen Knight's film concentrates solely on the protagonist's changing series of expressions as he talks on the phone to Bethan, Katrina, his associate Donal (Andrew Scott) and his boss Gareth (Ben Daniels). We never see the other characters, but hear their voices as they try to reason with Ivan and make him change his mind. When not on the phone, Ivan looks into his wing- mirror and exchanges imaginary conversations with his deceased father, whom Ivan blames for not fulfilling his paternal duties.LOCKE places considerable vocal and physical demands on its leading actor. Hardy turns in an excellent characterization of a family man buffeted by circumstances, while being tormented by the memory of that one night of lunacy when he got Bethan pregnant in the first place. Despite his determination to be different from his father, he ends up making precisely the same mistakes in life - something for which Ivan knows he is totally responsible, even though he would like to believe otherwise.Thematically speaking, Knight's film concentrates on the ways in which we try to cope with circumstances that often seem completely beyond our control. Despite his failings, we have to admire Locke for his resourcefulness, as he manages to keep the multi-million pound building project on track, even though it places almost impossible strain on Donal's physical and intellectual resources. Although Locke is not as successful in managing his family life, we understand that he has tried his best to atone for his past errors.The film has rather a soft ending, as Locke finishes the drive down to London, but nonetheless director Knight has created an effective low-budget piece of work that dramatizes the loneliness experienced by many on nighttime driving.",Locke
41,imseeg,UNDER PRESSURE,9,7 January 2020,"UNDER PRESSURE. That would be a good synopsis of this story. You think you know what pressure feels like, check out this story, which starts out seemingly casual only to turn into a full blown (introvert) drama later on. NOT suited for the popcorn loving masses, because however fascinating this drama might be, it is quite a subtle one, only suited for the art house movie lover.This story is about a man driving in a car for 90 minutes and making a zillion phone calls. Nothing else. We only see him driving and calling family, work and a woman he accidentally made pregnant. That fling, that short affair is the dagger in his soul, which is about to destroy everything he cares about...Incredibly unique and impressive structure of 1 man being filmed in his car for a continuous 90 minutes. And the drama reaches the sky. Goosebumps at the end. And ever increasing amazement about the pressure this dude has to endure, while he is driving and while his world is falling apart around him.",Locke
42,Vartiainen,Beauty in simplicity,9,7 June 2016,"A man drives towards London in the middle of the night. There's no one else present, barely even any additional traffic. He starts to make and receive calls, and slowly his impossible situation unfolds in front of us. He's driving to meet someone, but at the same time he should be overseeing a large construction site, the largest in recent memory. His job is on the line, but so is his future, as well as his life as a happily married man and father.Locke shines because the film makers knew to keep it simple. Tom Hardy is the only actor seen on screen, all the others are simply voices on his phone. The film is nothing more than his face behind a wheel and all the conversations he has throughout the night. That's it. And yet it's beautiful, touching, poignant. 12 Angry Men springs to mind. That movie was nothing more than a jury talking about a case within a single room. The dialogue they had amongst themselves was the entire movie. Yet it's one of the all-time greats. Likewise here.Locke is quickly explained. I've already said all I can without spoiling the story. But it's more than its summary, its very basic and simple idea. It's a delve into a man's psyche, a character study far deeper than we normally get to experience in the few hours we reserve for watching a movie. Hardy delivers us one of the most human characters in recent history and fully solidifies his credentials as a superb actor.Owe yourself to see this film.",Locke
43,jtindahouse,Not much here other than a fine performance by Hardy,5,31 December 2014,"It's fascinating to me that this was filmed in a single take. Does it add anything to the film though? No, would have to be the simple answer to that. 'Locke' is a drama set entirely inside a car driven by Tom Hardy's character Ivan Locke as he goes through an experience that will change his life forever. It plays out pretty much as expected which is the disappointing aspect. Nothing comes out of nowhere, nothing leaves our mouth gaping thinking 'where on earth did that come from?' It's as straight up and down as you could possibly get.Tom Hardy is a redeeming factor however. He has his character absolutely down. The accent is well done and actually quite pleasant to listen to after an initial period of getting used to it. The script's dialogue is the other saving grace. It's well written and believable for the most part (if you buy into the character). Sadly this isn't enough to make up for the otherwise dull screenplay writer and director Steven Knight has delivered here. I suspect this film will be completely forgotten on my part by this time tomorrow and that's never a good thing.",Locke
44,freemantle_uk,A truly fantastic performance from Tom Hardy,7,23 April 2014,"Locke is the second directorial effort from writer Steven Knight and he takes a more daring turn away from crime dramas, in order to craft a minimalistic drama, in one location and a single character on screen.Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is successful Welsh construction manager who is about to run one of the largest civilian construction projects in Western Europe, in the city of Birmingham. But instead of heading home to watch football with his wife (Ruth Wilson) and sons (Tom Holland and Bill Milner) in Manchester, he heads to Croydon in London to be with Bethan (Olivia Colman), a lonely woman he had a one night stand with and giving birth to his baby. While he drives to down on the motorway, he tries to keep control of his personal and professional life as its starts to collapse thought his phone.Locke is a character study and its centred around an excellent performance by Hardy, who had the unenviable task of carrying the film alone. Hardy as Locke is clinical figure, who aims to keep control of events even when he is in no real position to do so, by trying to stick to his personal sense of duty and obligations. Locke aims to be cool, calm and collected, as he tries to keep his marriage, support a lonely, depressed woman during a complex birth and keep the construction job going despite leaving it at its most important time.Hardy is a compelling screen presence and he gives a much more grounded, quieter performance, compared to some of his more grandiose roles in the past. He shows his talent and conviction, whether it was speaking with his colleagues or appealing to his wife and there are flashes anger and emotion when having an imagery conversations with his father as his shadow still lingers over Locke.Hardy does provide an excellent Welsh accent and Locke features a fine voice cast of voice cast. Actors like Wilson, Colman, Holland and Milner have all appeared in major projects and all deliver emotional performances. Wilson and Colman have difficult roles as they deliver it through their voices, Wilson as the betrayed wife and Colman as a scared woman with depression as she goes through giving birth alone.Locke is a bold experiment for Knight, as he steps out of his comfort zone, moving to a low-key, grounded drama and Hardy continues to enhance his reputation as an actor. Many people could easily relate to Locke, as many of us have tried to solve personal and professional problems over the phone. But due to limited scope, Locke could have been served better as a short film, short story or a theatrical or radio play.6.5/10Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",Locke

Yup, they could call this flick simply PHONE, because its only character--Ivan Locke--just drives around for 80 minutes one night making and taking phone calls, and that's the whole movie (except for the closing credits). Quibblers may argue that Ivan addresses some of his angst to his father's ghost implicitly riding in the back seat of his BMW, but the producers of LOCKE did not spring for a special effects OR CGI budget, so even dead pop's ghost in Laurence Olivier's 1948 HAMLET is more convincing that Papa Locke. I guess you could kind of call LOCKE a suspense thriller, since most of the audience at my showing were audibly expecting the BMW ""hero car"" to get T-Boned by a semi truck any moment, as Mr. Concrete stared trance-like at various objects in his vehicle for seeming minutes at a time (while tooling down a wet and surprisingly busy freeway populated by lots of big rigs and a dozen cop cars on emergency runs racing past). Alas, for those attendees expecting something to actually HAPPEN when they shell out $9.75 each for a movie, no such luck.",Locke
46,meeza,Locke rocks!,10,26 February 2016,"My review of the inventive indie film ""Locke"" will be lock and pun loaded, so if puns steer you wrong, I guess I suggest you to put it in reverse. But in moving forward, I must state that Writer-Director Steven Knight's movie was as innovative as they come. ""Locke"" stars Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke, a dedicated family man and construction manager who comes across and unexpected predicament that causes him to go on a not-so-joy ride. The movie is set entirely in Locke's vehicle as he makes and receives calls in his car on an important construction job and a domestic family situation that he must face. Might not sound too entertaining, but believe me there are no hangups in the way that Knight brilliantly directs and scripts the movie. This Knightrider was superb in his filmmaking of ""Locke"". However, the movie could not accelerate into greatness without the thespian-driven top performance from Tom Hardy as Locke. Yet another indicator that Mr. Hardy is one of the best actors working today. So get Lockey, and catch on to ""Locke"". ****** Excellent",Locke
47,alindsay-al,A fantastic one man show,9,6 October 2015,"Tom hardy is one of my favourite actors and the premise of this film is so unique so I watched it, and I loved it. The premise of the film sees this construction worker get into his car to travel somewhere and while receiving phone calls you see his life crumble. Now tom hardy plays ivan Locke and is the only person we see in the film and he is amazing in this movie. His character was likable but clearly had flaws and hardy did such a good job in making the audience truly care about Locke even at times that were not supposed to. I just wish he had got an Oscar nomination for this role. Also the voices of all the people on the phone felt incredibly real and you felt like you know the people even though you never see them. The story is just hardy in a car answering his phone but it is about so much more. You see this guy have his world crumble around him and you care about him so much as a guy. The only negative of the film is that it is a little repetitive but that is it. The script is fantastic, all the dialogue feels real with a great blend of drama and humour. The style was great with gritty setting and the camera work really helping sell hardys towering performance. Overall I lived locke and I would advise anybody looking for a unique film to watch it.",Locke
48,estebangonzalez10,Hardy's one man show,6,15 August 2014,"""I want to know that I'm not driving in one direction.""Director Steven Knight has left me in sort of a dilemma with his sophomore film, Locke. On the one hand the movie lacked the suspense that the trailers promised so I can't give it a higher rating. However, for minimalist cinema this might just be one of the best and most unique examples so it deserves a much higher rating. It ranks up there with the likes of Buried which was also basically a one man show starring Ryan Reynolds confined in a small space. The only difference was that in that film there was much more at stake. Locke isn't a film for everyone because some audiences might get bored with the entire premise considering it centers on one man (played by Tom Hardy) driving across the freeway in the course of one night while he is talking to different people on a hands-free mobile device. The main reason why I wanted to watch Locke despite not being attracted by the premise was the fact that it starred Tom Hardy and I basically will watch anything this guy stars in. Hardy didn't disappoint and he is the main reason why this film even worked in the first place. His performance felt authentic and natural making the audience forget for a moment that we were watching a super star as we followed a simple construction manager driving his BMW while trying to solve his issues involving his family and business. Hardy really delivers and impresses despite not having much to work with considering that this film would have never worked if it weren't for his powerful performance. Despite not having such an intriguing premise the pacing of the story worked just fine considering it clocked out at about 80 minutes. If Knight would have stretched this film out a little more than the pacing could've become an issue, but fortunately he didn't and I ended up enjoying it mostly thanks to Hardy's solid performance. Considering the film was minimalist I would also like to keep my review rather short and concise. The film gets points for originality and for Hardy's great performance. By only using dialogue through phone calls we really got to know this character and see how he tried to balance the different events that were unfolding before him in the course of one night. As a successful construction manager who tries to keep everything in order he sort of applies the same philosophy to his life and tries to do the right thing despite having made a mistake in the past. He is a fixer and that is what he tries to do as he deals with the specific events during each one of his conversations. Despite being a one man show, we hear other characters through the mobile phone and I was surprised at how each one really had their own unique personality despite never really seeing them. So I also have to give a lot of credit to Knight for his writing as well. The film succeeds in these aspects, but I still felt that the lack of suspense hurt this movie. In the end, Locke is a film about a man who is paying for his one mistake and seeing how everything is unraveling before him in the course of one night. That is all there is to it.",Locke
49,jimbo-53-186511,"Fantastic performance from Hardy, but the narrative becomes repetitive after a while",5,18 July 2021,"The night before his company is about to handle one of their biggest and most lucrative contracts construction manager Ivan Locke receives some news which causes him to drive hundreds of miles during the night. Along this journey Ivan uncovers a secret to several people (including his family and co-workers) resulting in a big impact on Ivan's professional and personal life....When I saw the Sky Movies premise for Locke it wrong-footed me slightly I was expecting it to be a film where Locke receives a call and learns that his family is in danger and is rushing back to rescue them (particularly as it is a 'real time' drama). Naturally when I learned that the film was essentially 80 odd minutes of one man confessing a sin to all and sundry whilst also trying to tidy up loose ends at work it did come as a slight disappointment.However, to say that the film is out and out bad is a little unfair and Locke isn't quite as simplistic as how I have surmised it in the above paragraph. As Locke progresses on his journey to London we learn about his tough upbringing and his less than impressive father whom Locke has imaginary conversations with and whom he seems to resent deeply. In fact, it seems to be Locke's fathers absence from his childhood that spurs Locke on to make this journey; it is a journey that Locke chooses to make out of a sense of morality more than anything else.Locke is also quite a blinkered character and it quickly becomes apparent that he is someone who is married to the job (despite being fired, being told by his wife not to come back home and his one night stand having complications with her pregnancy) Locke still chooses to juggle all of this with the arrival of the trucks the following morning; in a sense proving that he simply cannot let go.The main reason to watch this film is for Tom Hardy and if anyone can captivate an audience in a solo role in a one location film then Tom Hardy is mostly definitely your man. Due to his convincing performance, I could feel his pain as a man whom merely hours ago had a family and kids and was fully in control of his life and then to have it turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Having said that, it's impossible to really feel any sympathy for him as he did bring a lot of the problems on himself meaning as a character I found it difficult to feel much for him.As I've mentioned in my summary one major problem with this film is that once everything has been established and is out in the open the film has nowhere to go and it starts to become repetitive and if I'm totally honest I did start to lose a little interest in the film as it neared its end.",Locke

Cleverly written the viewer pieces together what is going on from the series of phone calls he makes and receives on the cars Bluetooth loudspeaker.

51,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"masterpiece performance from Tom Hardy, in an excellent film",9,24 April 2015,"Steven Knight's 'Locke' really shouldn't work. But it does, and magnificently so. Knight and star Tom Hardy have taken a long shot premise and whipped it into a haunting, utterly unique, emotionally suspenseful ride that holds you until the music swells into the final frame. It would be nothing without Tom Hardy's performance, and he focuses hard, pulls out all the stops and gives a fierce, compassionate, determined and heart wrenching performance that has to be seen to be believed. He is that freaking good. He plays Ivan Locke, a concrete developer mired in a never ending drive across British highways, trying to fix a chain of mistakes that have led up to this night, and all the while engaging in riveting conversations on his Bluetooth, that will decide his fate and that of the people around him. It's a dreamy, desperate, exhausting yet rewarding 90 minute journey, anchored by Hardy's superb work and a singular, well woven juggernaut narrative that makes you care about his plight.",Locke

But jokes aside, the film started out promisingly enough, it had mystery, suspense, drama and a decent score to boot but as soon as Ivan Locke (played effectively by Tom Hardy) gets behind the wheel of his BMW, starts driving and begins to take a series of phone calls and demons begin to crawl out of his hands-free mobile it all rises and peaks pretty quickly, leaving an uncomfortable downhill stroll as its climax.",Locke
54,Seraphion,Unique and fresh mean of story presentation,6,2 July 2014,"Locke (2013) tells the story of Ivan Locke, a high level field worker of a construction firm. The movie starts as he leaves his new building work site at night. That's when he receives a call. And the movie goes on, until it literally ends, at Locke car with him making and accepting calls through using a hands-free means. It turns out that Locke is going to another city a few hours drive away to accompany a woman with whom he had an affair some time ago because the woman is due to have her baby tonight. This inevitably forces Locke to inform his wife about his unfaithfulness through the phone. The other complications include his supervisors firing him because he choose not to attend to his new building tomorrow because he choose to be with his 'mistress'. There is also the problem of handling his subordinate/colleagues, one with a serious drinking problem, and one with a sloppy and undependable attitude.The story is quite nice, though it is built on a commonly found basic premise. The mood is kept quite stable at a low intensity, quite a slowed done I'd say. The pace being done is also slow although the movie uses music scoring that's quite suitable to heavier thriller movies. Although it has a good story, I'd say it's not its strongest offer. For me the movie's strong point is the screenplay development that lead to its unique presentation method. For ninety percent of the movie's duration, we see only Locke, and we see him only his car. This is very unique and rarely found, that a quite a complex and strong developed story can be told by only using one dominant set, with one only actor.The acting is surprisingly nice. Acting alone, and in only one set almost all the time, talking to the phone, Tom Hardy presents us an acting of high quality. Personally I appreciate his ability to conjure up a deeper accent (Scottish, If I'm not mistaken) that is a stronger than one he use to do, as compared to his part in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011). The accent, complete with a heavier and lower voice, is able to be presented with a calm composure. But he can also be harsh according to the dialog's requirements.Well the movie can also be seen as an overly long product placement ad campaign for BMW, LOL. Thus, this can feel a bit boring for some people, especially for those looking for a not so heavy story. But yeah it's quite a good movie, and I give it a 6 out of 10 score but refrain in recommending it.",Locke
55,bandw,The strengths and weaknesses of a rational mind,9,30 June 2015,"I had avoided seeing this based on the synopsis stating that the entire movie follows a man in a car talking on his cell phone. Fortunately that ultimately did not deter me, since I found this to be original and engaging. The man driving the car is Ivan Locke. Locke is the foreman on a major construction site; one of his main concerns throughout the movie is overseeing a concrete pour for a building's foundation, a pour that he has been working toward for months. But, for certain reasons, he will not be onsite for the pour and will guide one of his workers to do the job. This is just one thing that I liked--getting an in depth look at how one man earns his living. Most of the time in movies people's occupations are very much in the background and I am left wondering just how people are making a go of it. Concrete is not the most exciting material, but we come to see that Ivan is a highly skilled professional with much responsibility--one screw up and the building could ultimately collapse. There are many unsung heroes in the world and people like Ivan are among them. Ivan's temperament is perfectly suited to his job. When problems come up he calmly analyzes the situations and proceeds in a very logical manner, even when dealing with some volatile personal interactions. However, when Ivan tries to apply his calm rationality to personal problems on the home front, he is less successful. He has gotten himself into a predicament with his wife by having had a one-night stand (his one and only) with a co-worker. He assures his wife and his two teenage sons that he can fix things. In the heat of an argument with his wife he tries to control the situation by asking what reasonable next step should be taken to deal with the problem. His wife was in no mood to calm down and consider this as an abstract problem that could be fixed like a leaking roof.Throughout Ivan's 80+ minute journey we never see the people he talks with: his co-worker, his boss, his wife, his two sons, the other woman, a nurse, a doctor, and other minor characters. This sounds awfully boring, but it is presented in a way that is definitely not boring. This is accomplished in several ways. One way is utilizing the expressiveness of Tom Hardy's face viewed from differing angles. The filming is done on an actual highway and the passing traffic creates a moving background that encompasses Ivan's car, focusing attention on what's going on inside. Effective use is made of highway traffic on the freeways at night, making works of art out of the traffic patterns and lights. Exterior lights are filmed by merging them and defusing them to create beautiful mosaics. And only when the movie was over did I realize how much the score augmented the action. You might think that this story would work as a stage play or a radio program, but this movie makes the case for how superior movies can be to more restricted media.In spite of all of the ways that supported keeping my interest, it is ultimately Tom Hardy that carries the day. In this ultimate character study we get a good feeling for what manner of man Ivan is--a rationalist whose approach works well in some situations but not in others.",Locke
56,Sergeant_Tibbs,Brilliantly written moral drama.,8,4 May 2014,"When 2010 rolled around we were curious as to who would be the defining stars of the decade. Blockbuster Inception seemed to answer that question with Hollywood newcomer Tom Hardy, who would later team up with Christopher Nolan again for The Dark Knight Rises . Digging back into his filmography one would find that he always had an affinity for transformative performances, with Nicolas Winding Refn's Bronson, though the less he turns into a mumbling Russell Crowe the better. Even though Locke is a film on such a small scale, so small that there's barely enough room for film equipment on the set, it neither implies that it's not a transformative role nor does it downgrade his star rating. He's still the reason people come to see something with such a unique setup. Director Steven Knight is a seasoned writer above all, Oscar nominated for Dirty Pretty Things back in 2002. Although that film is tonally awkward in places, he has a strong sense of structure and character which definitely showed in the last third of that film. As Locke is set entirely within the journey of a car, this is certain to be an actor and writer film rather than a directors movie but this suits them very well.Indeed, the film begins with Ivan Locke leaving his work and entering his car. Only afterwards do we get a glimpse at his face. Here begins the extraordinary hour of an ordinary man. It's not terribly exciting, but it's life-changing for him, reminding us that everyone will have a moment of their life that would make an interesting film. Firstly here come the setup shots of all the bits and bobs that we will certainly become very familiar with, hopefully not to the point of being tired of them. It breaches on becoming an advertisement for BMW but that's all a necessary evil to bypass. As driving down the M6 at night only offers a limited variety of shots, Locke can often feel like the symphony of the dancing out-of-focus lights. However, that's a very pleasing aesthetic which is a daydream I've frequently had of shooting them whenever I go through a motorway at night. The camera is perpetually shaking, whether a creative choice or the steadiest they could make it I don't know, but it adds a nervous tension that an otherwise static camera wouldn't achieve. It's a shame that there's such a grimy colour grade added to the film that's unappealing, but it doesn't hold back the film. As a one-man-show with a bunch of familiar voices, it's ripe for becoming a play but the fact that a film like this can be made is thoroughly encouraging for British cinema.Even though all eyes are on Hardy, the writing steals the show in Locke. Not only are we painted such a vivid portrait of his life outside of his car but there's so many textured layers to his goals. Including his second-to-second, minute-to-minute goals that we experience first-hand in the film, he has a goal for an hour later, day, months, years and goals for life. In 80 real-time minutes, we can picture and be invested in who Locke was, what he'll be and what's at stake. It makes these distant and trivial obstacles really hurt when they feel impossible but fortunately Locke's resources are strong. However, he is a man with a dilemma and that dilemma came from a poor decision that's difficult to sympathise with. He tries his best to justify himself but the film hinges on how you feel about him after that reveal. It's a shame that the tone of voice of the actors is sometimes unconvincing, lacking the conviction for the big screen. Hardy's gentle Welsh accent is unexpected and an interesting contrast to his character but it's often hard to buy. At least he's not playing himself here, Ivan Locke is fully formed and shows Hardy's promise for cultivating conflicted characters. Despite its flaws and limitations, Locke is compelling and frequently emotional, touching on male anxieties in a fascinating way. However, with its brevity, it deflates instead of elates in its end but it's still a satisfying ride overall.8/10",Locke

It is actually a normal story of a man who makes a decision that will change his life forever, and the mounting suspense and conflict that goes with this decision.To summarize, Locke is a construction worker who, as the story progresses, loses his high paying job and family to attend the birth of his baby with a stranger whom he slept with once. I would recommend watching it on a slow night. Gets boring in certain parts, and that's the only reason I am giving it a 6. And Hardy's voice is pretty cool too!",Locke
60,antoniotierno,a truly innovating and original movie,8,7 May 2014,"A drama resounding with powerful and universal themes. The sole actor on screen (other extremely original trick) Tom Hardy, gives a terrific performance and the real innovation lies in the way writer-director Steven Wright chooses to tell the tale — real time and a tightly constrained space. The story blurs the line between theater and film in a very unconventional manner. Audiences are introduced to Locke as he drives along a safe speed, on an urgent mission. The contrast and contradiction between his calm demeanor, controlled voice and the upcoming catastrophe developing around him makes it all the more heartbreaking. It's no accident his job involves large quantities of concrete. All the dialogue occurs during hands-free phone calls inside Locke's car. Hardy's is the only face seen on screen for the whole duration of the movie, as we hear his conversations with key characters who are genuinely alive from the sound of their voices. The story has no flashbacks, voice-over narration or cuts, so that the audience is subject only to the conversations heard within the time Locke is on the road.",Locke
61,maurice_yacowar,Besieged builder manages conflicting responsibilities.,10,27 April 2014,"In Locke, writer/director Steven Knight's compelling tour de force, there are four central metaphors.(1) Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy), who's driving through the night to London, is a Construction Manager. Literally, he's to supervise the pour the next morning for a massive concrete construction. But he has other constructions to manage. He has chosen to skip that job in order to attend the birth of a baby from his one-night stand with Bethan (Olivia Colman), a plain, older woman with whom he once briefly worked. He also has to manage his marriage. His wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) on news of that infidelity bans him from home. He has to deal with their two sons' concerns, first with the televised soccer game he was to share, then with their sense of their broken family. Most essentially, he has to manage himself, the son (i.e., construction) of a philandering hippie father who abandoned him before birth. He addresses his dead father through the rear-view mirror. Ivan's virtuous choices here prove him nothing like his father. Far from a philanderer, Ivan's one infidelity was when after two bottles of wine he tried to give the lonely Bethan ""her last chance of happiness.""(2) Ivan creates both in concrete and in flesh. His embittered wife claims he loved his buildings more than his family. Certainly he holds himself in fierce responsibility for both. He is passionate about concrete. ""It's delicate as blood."" Even after Ivan is fired he takes every step to ensure the pour will succeed, delicately handling his colleague Gareth (Ben Daniels) and his substitute, a drunken Donal (Andrew Scott). But if concrete is delicate as blood, the flesh is a bond like concrete. That's why Ivan abandons everything else to attend the labour of a woman he barely knows. The child is his ""fault,"" his responsibility. Concrete or flesh, both need to be strong but both can be flawed. While a concrete construction may not survive a fault the flesh can recover. As Ivan's son describes the spectacular goal, the scorer Crawford, long considered ""a donkey,"" ran a solo that parallels Ivan's drive. Perhaps Ivan was an ass with Bethan but on this drive he scores because at great risk he does what he recognizes he should — not to be like his father..(3) The film's technical challenge — showing us only the hero — establishes the isolated human. We see Ivan, what he sees, where he is, but everyone else we only hear; we don't see them. Of course no-one can be isolated. As per John Donne, ""No man is an island."" Not even on the motorway. Or the off-ramp to which Ivan ultimately repairs to hear his new child's wail. The shots of vehicles in the night, their headlights abstracted into lily pads floating on the darkness, establish the society of isolates. As his relationships crumble Ivan feels reduced to just himself and his car. But this dramatically isolated figure is hardly by himself. Far from it, is the point of the narrative strategy. Ivan has all kinds of connections to other people, not least to the thousands who would be endangered if the mammoth concrete building proved imperfectly based. Then there are the people on his phone. (4) Those voices represent Ivan's lifelines, his connections beyond himself. Like the baby's umbilical cord around its throat ""The lifeline is a noose."" His father's bad example compels Ivan to attend his bastard's birth at whatever cost. He owes the unknown Bethan what comfort and support he can provide. He owes his family whatever they will allow him to give. He owes the concrete project his care. From each of these lifelines he has drawn life and purpose. Each is now exerting a strangling pressure on him. The license on Locke's Mercedes starts with Adio. It's an incomplete Spanish goodbye and Portuguese for ""I postpone."" Both fit. Ivan gets his surname from John Locke, the 17th Century British empirical philosopher whose best known works dealt with the limits on human understanding and the importance of basing government on a social contract. There are those strangling lifelines again. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com.",Locke

I was expecting more of a life and death situation to be the main theme, and even though that is not really the case, this is still a tense little movie mainly about a man who is wanted and torn between three different locations and three sets of people in his life as he tries to do what he thinks is the right thing. Tom Hardy is the film's biggest asset with his calm and assured performance while everything around him begins to slowly fall down.

65,bryank-04844,'Locke' is one little film that demands to be seen.,8,17 August 2015,"I'm a sucker for movies that take place all in one setting. From films like 'Buried', 'Cube', and 'Rope', these directors have told fascinating stories with rich characters in one small setting. This allows us to really connect with our characters on-screen and develop a stronger relationship rather if we were seeing something with blockbuster sized special effects. Don't get me wrong, I like those movies too, but I love these films that are set in one room. I just fully immerse myself in the story. And that's just what I did with Steven Knight's 'Locke', which is all set inside a moving car as a man (Tom Hardy) drives from Birmingham to London one evening to take responsibility for a mistake and prove to himself that he is a better man than his father was.Who would have thought that a story about laying down cement for a building would be so entertaining. I certainly didn't. We meet Ivan Locke (Hardy) who is driving his BMW in the middle of the night to see the birth of his kid. The catch is that this kid is the product of an affair he had with an older co-worker nine months ago, to which his wife and two teenage sons know nothing about. But on this drive, Ivan is dedicated to righting the wrongs and has a list of things to do. One of them is telling his wife about his affair and soon to be born son. The other debacle is that in the morning, Ivan is in charge of laying the cement for the biggest building set to go up in Europe, and if something goes wrong, hundreds of millions of dollars could be lost. He chooses to tell his boss that he won't be there and that a colleague of his who is under-qualified will look after the job. Needless to say, with in a couple of minutes while driving his car and talking hands free to a few people close in his life, his marriage, job, and home are all about to crash into a wall going 100 mph.Ivan is a very mild mannered man who never raises his voice, loses his temper, or gets agitated. He is calm, cool, and collected throughout, which might be why he has succeeded in life so much. He is always on point and always dependable, even with this birth and affair. He spends his driving time switching phone calls from his distraught wife who as time goes by gets worse and worse over the phone as her life falls apart in the span of a couple of hours. Ivan also talks with his fellow co-worker who has a drinking problem and tells him exactly what to do to make tomorrow go smoothly at the cement pour, which several things have to come to fruition and happen for all things to run smoothly. Then there is his irate boss and the very lonely woman who is having his kid who is very manipulative. However, Ivan never breaks and constantly tells this woman he will never love her and that this was all a mistake, but he will take responsibility. It's a flawless look at the downfall of a good man who is trying to do the right thing and clean up his mistakes.Steven Knight does a fantastic job using great camera angles all set inside this moving car, and yes, you might feel a little claustrophobic, but that is somewhat the point here. There are all these terrible situations that are all boiling to a point of an eventual explosion that may or may not ever come. Hardy gives an amazing performance. He makes us like him even though he has done wrong, but it's his coolness and level headedness that keeps us siding with him, and of course his honesty and wanting to the right thing. The voice actors also do a phenomenal job here too as they keep giving our main guy so much to work with. It's no doubt that Ivan is having one of the worst days of his life, and Hardy delivers every line and has such perfect body language that we forget this is an actor and start to feel like this might be a real person. It's remarkable.There are a few instances where Ivan begins to talk to an empty backseat through the rear-view mirror, as though his father were in the back, listening to his son berate him for not being a good man. These occurrences showed that Ivan was losing a grip on things and didn't feel right with the tone of his character or story. But that was my only complaint. Other than that, 'Locke' is one little film that demands to be seen.",Locke

70,Likes_Ninjas90,It is well-written and professionally constructed and guided by a powerful performance by Tom Hardy,8,23 August 2014,"A number of films recently have focused on the survival of a single character that is fighting against the environment or the elements. Gravity, Tracks, All is Lost and now Locke are examples of this subgenre. These films are a response to how cinema has lost its sense of physicality and the illusion we are watching real people in peril. Aside from Gravity, which heavily employed special effects, these survival films rediscovered physical trauma and real spaces by relying on practical filmmaking rather than computer generated images. Locke was directed by Michael Knight, the screenwriter of Dirty Pretty Things and Eastern Promises, on a budget of two million dollars. It is like All is Lost in that there is only one setting and one visible character but different because instead of near-silence it is entirely dialogue driven. The concept is deceptively simple. The whole film takes place in the BMW of Ivan Locke as he takes calls from his boss, his wife, his mistress and colleagues to explain a choice he has made. The car is a minute setting that hides the impressive craftsmanship and technical feats. The film was shot in only eight days, with the wheels of the BMW removed and the car placed on the back of a moving low-loader. Three RED digital cameras were used, they are better for shooting in dimly lit areas, and they supplied a handful of camera angles inside and around the car. We don't see any of the other actors in the film but hear their voices through Locke's car phone. The other actors were in a hotel room with phone lines to the car recording the conversations we hear in the film. A soundproof car was necessary to retain a clean audio track. The amount of coordination for such a small scale film is stunningly realised through clever, economic filmmaking.The film's greatest asset is Knight's decision to cast Tom Hardy as Locke who is in excellent form. Hardy has fared well in physical combat roles with films like Warrior and The Dark Knight Rises. Though restricted to a car seat for almost the entire eighty-five minutes, Hardy gives a physical and emotive performance. His body language is subtle as he mostly relies on his facial expressions and his eyes. He is served well by extended takes from a medium close-up shot that provide him with time and space to inhabit his character. While previously criticised for being inaudible, his voice is articulate and precise in pronouncing his lines. Locke's dialogue dominantly reflects his unchanging mindset and his refusal to alter his life-changing decision. Hardy effectively uses a firm tone in his voice to reflect how definitive this night is for him. A character later tells him ""the difference between once and never is everything"" which further illustrates the ultimate power of choices. Locke's decision is to leave behind his job as a construction foreman who is meant to oversee a major transfer of concrete to a large building operation. Instead he opts to travel along the M1 from Birmingham to London to be by the side of a girl he slept with because she is having their baby. Locke is driven by a hatred for his own father who wasn't there for him as a child. His choices are personal but also a moral obligation to right his own wrongs and to correct his f*ck-up as he puts it. He doesn't love this girl and on his car phone he tells her ""we can't love or hate each other. It just happened"". His attitude is cold because he treats his situation like it is a resolvable work problem where he can use his precision without succumbing to emotion or feelings. His surname, the references to concrete and the reoccurring images of the road are important symbols. They reflect the character's lack of free-will and his immobility to change his path after this choice.Under Knight's tightly paced script, strong characterisation and dialogue for the side characters brings vividness to the actors' voice work. There are no cutaways to these actors. They express their roles so well that we never need anything more than their voices to see them. Tense verbal and psychological conflict is built from Locke's goal of having to convince each person on the phone he is making the right decision. Each call to the car represents the disbelief Locke has to resolve. The most important call comes from his mistress Bethan (Olivia Colman) in the hospital. She calls him because she is scared and alone. The hospital staff also rings him because of complications like the umbilical cord wrapping around the baby's neck. He calls his family and his son wonders why he isn't at home but he can't bring himself to explain why. When he tells his wife Katrina (Ruth Wilson) about the baby she is so distraught and shocked we fear that she might hurt herself. Comedy is unexpected but welcome in the film. Some big laughs brighten the mood. Each time his boss Gareth (Ben Daniels) angrily calls him, his caller ID on the car screen appears as ""bastard"" and then he blasts him for walking away from the job. One of the best characters is Locke's colleague Donal (Sherlock's Andrew Scott) who Locke trusts to finish the transfer of concrete even though he is unsure of himself and unreliable. There are hilarious exchanges like when Locke is worried Donal is drinking or when he tells him that he has to run down the street to find someone. At its best, the film creates a chaotic rhythm of exchanges and overlapping calls where it becomes exciting to hear Locke juggling calls and personalities and has to convince people of his decisions.",Locke

He's an actor that is really able to transform himself into the characters he's playing and Ivan Locke is one of them.Locke follows Ivan Locke, a successful construction manager, who receives a phone call on his drive from work which lead to a series of events that threaten his peaceful livelihood.The way Locke is executed is very interesting. It takes place over the course of one car journey with Tom Hardy receiving and answering calls as he drives. There have been other films like this which take place in one location and Locke is an example of a great one. Despite its limited scale, I found this film gripping throughout its 85 minute runtime. It's not easy to be interested in watching a man talk to people over the phone whilst driving for 85 minutes but the script by Steven Knight is very well written. This film shows a man slowly losing the perfect life he had and Knight builds this tension and chaos extremely carefully.With the rest of the cast like Tom Holland and Olivia Colman having voice roles, Tom Hardy is the only person we see during the film. Carrying an entire film by yourself isn't easy but Hardy pulls it off effortlessly. This is easily one of his best performances. It's great to see Hardy play an average guy and his reactions to every phone call was done really well. This is truly a one-man show.I thought Locke was brilliant.

76,Rickting,One of the coolest car journeys of the year,8,22 November 2014,"Tom Hardy drives down the motorway. He tries to sort out some business related matters and family issues. He's alone in his car talking to various other characters on the phone. How is this so compelling?! Locke could be seen as an experiment instead of a film but it's a very good experiment. This is cinematic minimalism with only one character on screen almost the whole time. With this kind of film, when you're stuck in a car with one guy for the whole thing you need a good performance. A great one. Tom Hardy exceeds that and delivers solid proof that he is a genuinely excellent actor. He carries the entire film beautifully and is emotional without being hammy and understated without being boring. It's Hardy's film and without it the film would be weaker. The film was difficult to decipher from the marketing, but it was marketed as a thriller mystery and it removes this element too early for its own good. It's very short as well, so it feels a bit slight as a result.Although this is an actor's film, it's couldn't have worked without the solid work from Steven Knight. His script is very powerful and while it's certainly not a cheerful film at all, it feels believable and relatable. You wouldn't have known but the car setting gives him a chance to show off some directing chops. The film boasts some interesting cinematography. You don't have to see this one in the cinema as this works just as well on a small screen. It possibly might not be a hugely re-watchable film but I'm very glad to have seen it. This is a very bold and unusual film overall led by a commanding performance from Tom Hardy. It's also a drama which isn't sentimental or manipulative and it feels authentic and real. It's a more obscure 2014 movie worth checking out, especially for Tom Hardy fans. It's not the best drama you'll see all year and is a bit depressing, but at least for once it actually feels like something different.8/10",Locke

He  stays in the car. He never leaves the car. You'll hate it! Don't go!  Please.  You'll need a brain and a level of emotional attachment to appreciate  Locke. For those who have the requisite brain cells and ability to  immerse themselves in a world created by the cinematic experience,  Locke is a very satisfying experience indeed.  Not sure where you stand on this? Was Buried a boring, pointless film  about a man in a box or a terrifying experience, an inventive film that  was fearlessly shot (in a box), and the film where Ryan Reynolds proved  to be a very fine actor, albeit one who frequently squanders his talent  on pap? If the former, no, Locke is not for you. If the latter, go now,  go quietly and be enthralled.  Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is a construction manager on the eve of  overseeing the biggest foundation-laying exercise in Europe. He climbs  into his car at the end of his shift and, as he drives, makes and  receives a series of phone calls in which we understand why he isn't  going home tonight. Through his own doing, his world implodes. He knows  this and he understands the consequences, but he has a journey to make,  both literal and metaphorical, and he's determined to make it no matter  what.  Though writer/director Steven Knight has written numerous films and TV  episodes, Locke is only his second feature (after last year's  Redemption) and it is a film that, though it may not receive a vast  audience, will set him apart as a director who knows how to maintain  the tension and engage his audience with the simplest of devices. Do  you remember wondering how Joel Schumacher could make Phone Booth a  nail biting experience? Knight manages to keep the attention and  emotional engagement just as strongly, but without a sniper.  Locke is Hardy's film, no doubt about it. Though there are superb vocal  performances from Olivia Colman (almost pouring emotion though the  telephone), Ruth Wilson and Andrew Scott that are humorous,  heartrending and so full that one can very clearly visualize them as if  they were in the car with Locke, it is Hardy who commands our attention  so absolutely.  His Welsh accent is a little jarring for the first minute, but it works  here and is only unfamiliar to us because we expect to hear Bane's or  Tommy Conlon's voice issuing from that hulk behind the wheel. His  performance is controlled, subtle and tightly wound as the man who  knows that every decision he makes will bring trouble to him, but  understands with equal clarity that it is what he must do. His turmoil  is as apparent as his need to do his duty and honesty prevail.  When the early phone calls play out upon the screen, my own stomach  tightened with the memory of difficult conversations ending  relationships in years gone by. No, you may never be in Locke's  predicament but, unless you have live a charmed life or are devoid of  conscience and emotion, you'll identify with that sickening feeling  when dealing with problems of the heart head on. It's uncomfortable,  it'll be closer to home for some than for others, but Hardy makes it  certain that we know his anger, frustration and desperation to deal  with what lesser men have run from.  Dickon Hinchliffe's (Out of the Furnace) score is subtly powerful, the  perfect soundtrack for an anguished journey, and not even the constant  of the BMW brand (obvious, but not gratuitous like Google's feature  length commercial, The Internship) can detract from Locke the man and  the film. And, let's face it, there has to be something on the steering  wheel for Locke to pound.",Locke

Ivan Locke did something foolish and he knows he did something foolish but he's trying to do something right and be an upstanding human being but he just watches his entire world come crumbling down—and all through phone calls. The emotion and heartache and trouble that Locke deals with on his drive to London made the film more than a gimmick and something dramatic and engaging. This was also helped by the fact that Tom Hardy is doing a fantastic job as Locke—of course, I can't think of a time when Hardy isn't doing a fantastic job.""Locke"" is emotional, simple, and is carried by a great actor.

The last film that generated this degree of single-location tension was Colin Farrell's PHONE BOOTH. Locke is just as good - maybe even better.",Locke

82,andrewroy-04316,A good example of truly minimalist filmmaking,7,6 December 2018,"Locke is definitely an extreme and unique perspective in pure, abstract minimalism, and it pulls it off quite successfully. Hardy is great as literally the only visible character in the entire movie, bringing a character to life and giving him flaws and nuance, which allow the audience to connect to him. Knight makes the bold decision to not shy away and go all in on the format, and I think the movie is better for it. How much can your life change in 90 minutes, in just a handful of phone calls? While I was worried it would become repetitive or monotonous, the visuals of him driving emphasized reflection and different angles, and between a great script and a great performance, it held my full attention all the way through. Locke's choices definitely merit deeper inspection - why would he throw away his home life and job, which he's committed so much to, to support a woman he could easily ignore? Locke reminded me of the simple, artistic value of cinema and the power the director has to show the audience a story. It's nothing earth shattering, but it's well made, original, and Hardy is excellent.",Locke
83,bbickley13-921-58664,Impressive vehicle for Mr. Hardy,7,30 April 2014,"I went to see the movie because the review of the movie said that it would change what you thought about film making. This would be true if you've never seen a movie before, but that is not the case.Not to say that the movie is not good. It acts as a sort of one man play starring Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke, a man who made a mistake in his past that threatens to unwrap his perfect life when he tries to do the right thing. The movie totally relies on the actor playing the role and Tom steps up to the challenge nicely.But I've seen this kind of one man play with Buried starring Ryan Reynolds and Brake starring Stephen Dorff. I can even mention other movies like 127hours or Phone booth that have a similar concept.What makes Locke different is that the pressure of life and death is not there. In those movies the leading (and only) men were threaten with the proposal of death, While in this movie, Ivan Locke's way of Life is threaten with change, and it's this change in the concept that made the movie Quiet and low key, but the filmmakers were still able to make if fast pasted and kinetic (having it take place in a Car going down the highway helps).The movie had the same pressure of a ticking clock about to explode and the lead character attempting to talk himself out of the situation, but the filmmaker does not force the tension or thrills on you. Ivan Locke's situation is very down to earth and every day to day. Watching him attempt to deal with this situation could have come off boring after a half hour if not for Tom Hardy showing his mental acting chops (versus how physically intimidating he seemed as Bane in Dark Knight Rises, he's a small man in real life).Though the movie was good to watch I could have gotten the same effect streaming it at home on Netflix.

No, really, the whoooole film takes place on the road in the interior of an SUV with one tangible actor on screen for its entirety.Ivan Locke, played by Tom Hardy, is a man in a very precarious situation in his life, the details of which are slowly revealed through the first twenty minutes of the film. A construction manager in charge of the foundation of a massive building project, leaves the day before due to extenuating circumstances. Faced with difficult decision, of which an action is necessary, he sets in motion the pivotal moments that will impact his life for years to come. While on the road, he must face multiple crises, all the while trying to remedy them all and accept the choices he's made.Written and directed by Steven Knight, Locke is a dramatic film many people can identify with in its tangible grasp of real life difficulties. It is claustrophobic and frustrating even. There is a complexity within Locke with the futility to Locke's decisions because there is no clear path and consequences around every bend.I will admit, the first ten minutes I wanted to stop the film because it felt tedious and boring and I needed more action, in the classical sense of the word. By the end, I was surprised by how much I liked it, but that shock was not able to surpass the low expectation threshold for appreciation to genuine admiration for the film.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Locke
89,willcundallreview,A gripping one man drive,8,30 October 2015,"It might not look like the most interesting of films from the outlook, a man sits in his car for 84 minutes and talks on his phone, but my word this is interesting. Locke is a movie that is dramatically brilliant and mixes fantastic acting with some very good directing and writing and in the end produces a movie that is both thrilling and yet emotional too. The plot revolves around a man named Ivan Locke who is just leaving a large concrete pour where soon a building he has helped create the foundations for will be built. Locke is travelling home to his family, his wife Katrina and his two boys Eddie and Sean, but the story takes a very different turn and Ivan's decisions could affect the rest of his life.Shot pretty much entirely on a motorway (the M6 to be exact), Locke is one of those movies which utilises its actors and the way in which it looks to us the viewer. First of all Tom Hardy is magnificent in the role as Ivan Locke, his calm voice is well put on but he manages to make Locke a character that can jump from one emotion to the other, Hardy makes the transition look simple. We hear the voices only of all characters otherwise involved, Ruth Wilson, Olivia Colman and Andrew Scott are some of the voices on hand that all night seem to ring continuously and do a fine job of it as well, Ivan seriously though uses his phone a lot! The way in which it looks is incredible, it's the lights of the cars and the lamp posts that make this oddly sleepy but in truth a movie that you can't take your eyes off because it's so damn beautiful. I can't think of many movies which use driving long distances to such wonderful effect, especially when you consider the car doesn't stop much and it is also night outside of the car. I think the director Steven Knight really get's it right in tone and it feels he knew exactly what he wanted because this is a great movie, I mean sure this will not be everyone's cup of tea but I don't think you can deny this doesn't look nice.I think another way in which Knight really makes this gripping and something to be watched by all is the way in which he moulds the story around Locke, the drive instead of being quiet instantly becomes a stunning kind of ride, one where Ivan is drawn into many different things that change course as the movie goes toward the end. I can't forget of course that all important writing from Knight as well, this is the sort of movie where writing is most obviously observed and it is easy also to see that Steven Knight hits the nail on its head and creates a script worthy of much praise. Overall Locke is a movie I could recommend to anyone, it is really a likable piece and even those lacking in attention for movies I feel could still be drawn in by this. As for Tom Hardy well what else can be said that what an actor, this guy deserved a lot for this and I feel this is really a showcase of what he can do, uses his skills well and without him being good this could have crashed and burned before it even reached Luton. So yes Locke a movie that feels like a bit of an experiment but really it isn't, Steven Knight I have no doubt knew exactly what this would do to us the viewer and grabbed the opportunity with both hands.",Locke
90,Just-A-Girl-14,Creative,7,8 March 2021,"This movie is basically a one man show. We get to see how one man's life falls apart during a 90 minute car drive. The entire movie is shot in a confined space of a car. Tom Hardy is the only on screen actor. The others are just voices over the phone. Usually I love movies like that so I was excited to watch it. However this was different than what I expected. If you ever watched Buried or Phone Booth then you are familiar with the concept but unlike those two, this movie is slow paced and much more realistic. It's more of a drama than a thriller. It makes you think about life and about people. Here you have this guy who all his life tried to do everything right and be a trustworthy man mess up one night and watch everything he ever worked for falling apart. Even then he tries to do the right thing. At least, in his mind. It's very realistic and quite painful to watch. It's like he's trying to do right by everyone but falls short on everything. He leaves his job at a huge critical moment, he tells his wife he had an affair over the phone and he doesn't get to be beside the ""lonely sad woman"" while she's giving birth to his new baby. Tom Hardy gives a very good performance of this man. You can feel his pain and you almost want to sympathize with him. It really makes you think... Who's side are you on? Do you side with his wife? His boss? His worker? His sons? That lonely woman? The new baby? Or maybe him? How would it end? Did he fix it? Did he do the right thing or did he screw up so badly that it's beyond repair? Sadly, we don't get to know but I think that's the whole point. Watching his car drive away and then watching the traffic shot makes you think of all the other stories going on in every single car. This is just one car, one man, one life. There are many others. Very creative.",Locke

94,James_De_Bello,8.5/10,8,25 September 2014,"Locke is a special movie, if you haven't seen yet do yourself a favour and check it out, it is an extraordinary-Hitchcockian piece of filmaking. The way in which you are introduced to this scenario and its characters is really something to admire. Obviously it is a one character study in a one closed location and the only external-world source of news is Locke's telephone, but what the director managed to do here in making everything out of the car seem so tangible and real is nothing short of amazing. The dialogue is so insightful because of its naturality, these people speak as real people and this was the reason that made the events unfolding away so clear in my mind: Knight had me create clear visions of everything involving the drama, from locations to character faces to Locke's house, everything was stamped in my mind and gave this movie an extraordinary sense of realism. It was shot beautifully too, but I wish the director had gone with a fully real-time approach: clearly the duration of the movie is the same as the journey's but it wasn't coherently addressed altogether, so if the director hadn't used overlapping shots and edits at some points I would have been more satisfied, nothing bad, but they kind of took me briefly out of the moment, I would have appreciated a lot a 100% natural flow but what I got was 90%. Alongside this I have to say the ending was a bit cold and could have created much more of an impact, yet on the other side I feel like the smallness of it made it a perfectly fitting ending for the story's sake: there was much potential that wasn't used, but by using it it could have ruined the movie so I am a bit torn on this, al least it did not disappoint me (as so many movies do in their third act). Now, to the centre of it all: Tom Hardy's performance here is unbelievably grounded, there is nothing here that's showy or that will blow you away and it is exactly what makes it magnificent. He digs deep inside this man and he disappears from the screen leaving he space for the character: that's all I saw and what made me feel on that seat in the car: feeling the same claustrophobia and sweat that Locke was feeling: I honestly had a sense of sharing the physicality of the character that I have rarely ever experienced. Hardy makes this movie so much of what it is, he simply is a powerhouse and confirms himself as one of my favourite actors of this time, I cannot speak highly enough of him and he better receive a nomination for his work here (it won't probably happen). Adding to this is a very riveting drama, mainly composed around Locke's character study, a very interesting person that I couldn't help but care about and relate to: I really managed to understand his struggle with some important moral issues that are raised and that most importantly aren't solved by the movie: the director never takes part in the argument. This was a very satisfying film.",Locke

97,jayjaycee,Driving into tragedy,7,12 March 2020,"""Locke"" is a 2013 drama directed by Steven Knight starring Tom Hardy and Olivia Colman. From time to time I like to give those flicks a spotlight that are generally not on the radar of the mainstream audience and that are created in an experimental manner. Many of you told me that I should check out this one and I was impressed by the outcome. This film definitely matches my definition of experimentalism and built up a tight story in a notable minimalistic way. Like Ryan Reynolds did in the bone chilling ""Buried"" it's Tom Hardy who singlehandedly carries the whole plot with an surely impressive one man show, as he literally sits behind the steering wheel and drives the story in such a superb direction. Only supported by incoming and outgoing phone calls of surprisingly well elaborated side characters, it creates a tremendously packing and well working narrative that, judging by how it resulted from such a simple stylistic device, deserves my deepest respect. One may ask: What does the film deal with for almost ninety minutes if it's literally just a man driving? That's definitely a justified question, but I was mildly surprised by the outcome too. It deals with the decisions of a man who tries to fulfill his moral obligations and at the same time tries to save both his past and future life while struggling to decide what's the right thing to do. Over the whole runtime of the film I had this uneasy feeling in my guts, because I felt the character and his haunting dilemma extremely. It's a twisted essay on the morality and obligations of a simple construction manager who more and more has to witness how his tediously built up life continuously falls more and more apart. When he's not talking about his family issues, he's taking about the greatest day of his job and it sounds like a simple filler of time in the first place, but I considered it as a metaphor that mirrored his own life. It's unexpectedly sad and depressing at times, because most of the gut wrenching drama is a direct result of your own imagination and you can only see how Hardy's Ivan Locke suffers from the aftermath of every verbal fight and devastating call and how his face attempts to ignore the inner turmoil and pain and keep it together. Strangely, I couldn't neither judge nor promote his actions and ideas, as he really had a reason behind all of it. It's a little bit of both and I think that's so interesting about this well written character. He has a past and a future and even though he made mistakes, only wants to make the best out of it. Furthermore, it's notable how the whole film is shot. As it takes place in real time, the whole film consists of night shots with only a few streetlights in between and the atmosphere this familiar scenario creates is subliminally underlining both the dark and light scenes of this drama. If there's one thing I'm dissatisfied with, it's the conclusion. It too much favours the action of it's protagonist and too easily resolves his well built up dilemma and shows that it's a brilliant idea to just leave everything behind and start something new. I think that just didn't his previously severely torn character justice and was a too easy conclusion to the story. While it wasn't quite possible to pass a judgement on him, the ending made it indeed possible. It sorta contradicts the film's impartial approach to the conflicts and the small hidden details. All in all, this film benefits from the minimalistic powerhouse performance of Tom Hardy and it's experimental style that definitely proves extreme strength in terms of narrative structure and works out pretty well. It's only the lazy ending that bugs me a little as it didn't reach the same masterful level of the previous hour and a half. Aside from this, it's a film that highly entertained me and really made me wish there was more of it's kind.",Locke
98,ragingbull_2005,Near miracle of a movie,7,2 August 2014,"Locke is an 80 minute long near miracle. Shot completely inside a car, with the car's occupant Ivan Locke talking to people over his car phone, this makes for riveting drama. It almost seems to be a motion picture representation of Y.AB. Keats's ""Things fall apart"". The writer director, Mr. Knight, brilliantly shows the unravelling of Locke's personal and professional lives, giving the viewer unalloyed, voyeuristic peek into Locke's demons, transgressions and attempts to redress them. Tom Hardy, who is present in every frame of the film, as the eponymous Locke, is A one. He makes the character come alive and confirms his reputation of being a method actor. But the real winner is the absolute gem of a script. This is one of those movies, which can and will never be remade in Bollywood as no director / actor can be so gutsy to create such a one character masterpiece. Very highly recommended.",Locke

But SADLY though the writers seemed quite skilled,having built a compelling story,and broken a man's spirit down,over just 90 minutes worth of phone calls in the car, when they got to the end, they just GAVE UP! They quit short of any goal,and they robbed US of a decent ending for the hour and a half we invested, they robbed LOCKE of closure that he rightfully deserves- I say this through gritted teeth, because I think he kept compounding one bad decision on top of another,and ended up hurting everyone around him, and they robbed THEMSELVES of completing a work that truly could have been worthy of awards because of its unique premise and delivery,but if you only do something half way, you mug might as well not do it at all! PLUS, SO MANY questions/scenarios were left unanswered, if this woman is repeatedly lying to the hospital about him being her partner, and she's constantly trying to coerce an ""I Love You"" out of him, what ELSE id's she lying about? Is the baby REALLY 2 months early or right in time? With the umbilical cord situation,I'd hazard a guess that baby is on time. Making it NOT Locke's! Also, what kind of man does that to his wife over the phone? SO MANY TIMES the kids called,saying things like ""moms in the bathroom,is everything ok?"" You EXPECT that his wife has attempted suicide or had a heart attack, and the kids will have to deal with the fall out,and you're on the edge of your seat almost pushing the kids to check on their mom before it's too late! But no! The writers lost all forward momentum,mom came out,she talked to her sisters,she's fine & angry, after ALL THOSE YEARS of marriage, within an hour,she doesn't even collapse,she composes herself and gives him her decision!

There's wire a few BIG loose ends,because NOTHING was solved, it's like the movie had no meaning or message! They just GAVE UP... Like a wide receiver running the ball and setting it down on the 1yard line,saying they finished their job, it's a complete product & waking away! Ugh!

100,trublu215,A heart pounding drama featuring one of the best performances of all time.,10,20 April 2014,"I was lucky enough to catch an early screening of this before it officially hits the States theatrically and I must say, this was quite possibly one of the best films I've seen in the last 5 years. Locke pits Tom Hardy as titular character going through a life crisis in real time while taking a drive into the London nightlife. Locke features Tom Hardy in, what quite possibly may be, the best performance from an actor that I've seen in quite some time. The film does very little in giving the audience much eye candy, considering the entire film takes place in Locke's car as he drives through the night. What this film does, which not many films do anymore, it relies solely on Hardy's brawny shoulders. With very little in terms of a pay off regarding plot, Hardy's tour de force performance engrosses you with every minute that goes by. There was not one moment I can think of where I was looking at my watch or was at all bored with it. To think that an entire film taking place in a singular location, let alone it being entirely in a car, would be heart pounding even had me a little skeptical. Fear not, Locke will have you gripping the handles of your seat and will have you talking about it even after the end credits roll. Many people will most likely dislike the abrupt and ambiguous ending but at the end of the day there was no other way to end this night from hell for this man. Steven Knight writes and directs a taut, white knuckle thriller here that deserves to be seen by the masses. I still can't get over how great this film was, so much so that when it officially comes to theaters, I'll be racing back to see it again. Overall, this is minimalist filmmaking with a one two punch for a lead performance. If you're fans of Eastern Promises and Dirty Little Things, you will love Steven Knight's Locke. And even if you are not fans of those films, the film is worth seeing for Tom Hardy's performance alone. I highly recommend this film.",Locke
101,adampkalb,"Now THIS is how you make a film on a low budget with a captivating, dialogue-driven story.",10,3 January 2021,"I tried watching Buried which had a 3-million dollar budget, but watching 10 movie clips of it was enough to show me it was too grisly to watch again. I checked out Brake, which was half of 1 million dollars, but it was very unprofitable, had a much lower meta score and star rating than Buried, and broke the rules on having more than 1 person on screen. That was when I knew Locke was the one-person film for me! Its star rating and meta score were a bit higher than Buried. I saw the whole film yesterday, and it was awesome. The title may sound like Ivan Locke is...locked in his car all night, but if he was stuck in his car and wasn't driving, that would make a much boring story. Locke did have a few dull moments in the middle where I almost fell asleep, but that was because I was already tired. I did not find the movie Locke to be boring at all! For 90 minutes (even though the time we see is closer to 78) Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) is driving to a hospital where Bethan Maguire (Olivia Colman) is having a baby from a one-night stand where they were drunk. Locke has a lot of back-and-forth car phone conversations between his family and the construction site. Ivan gets fired from the construction site for not showing up on time, and his wife breaks up with him when she finds out that he slept with another woman. Once and never means all the difference in the world. Meanwhile, Ivan's son Eddie, seemingly nearly unaware of this (I say nearly because he knew his mom was crying in the bathroom), is describing a football game for him and plans to watch it with him later, and he is the only person in Ivan's life who is still on his side at the end of all of this. With no job or wife left to turn towards, Ivan continues to drive to the hospital and start a new family with Bethan. Her new baby is her last chance at happiness, and Ivan wants to be there for her. Locke is furious at how badly his father treated him, and he wants to be a better dad, and maybe a better husband for Bethan than he was for Katrina. Perhaps Eddie would like having a new half-sibling, since he still likes his dad and wants to watch the football game with him if they ever see each other again. All in all, Locke was a very interesting film with an exercise in testing the limits of one lead actor. It inspired me to do the same and write a 1 million dollar-budget film for 2028 with a woman of color as opposed to a white male like Tom Hardy: Stephanie Beatriz, a much lesser-known actress by comparison, who was still new enough for Twelve Forever after six seasons of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but is still just as talented as Tom Hardy. The Crayon has hundreds of thousands of views, more than any other Young Storytellers story on YouTube, and Stephanie's methods of acting like a child with her voice really made it popular. However, my one-person movie will have a unique setup you did not already see in Locke.",Locke

One person in a predicament, set in the confined area etc, eg Castaway, Phonebooth, Buried etc. I stuck with it throughout, it flagged a little in parts, but keeps you interested.That's with the premise that the story is all building up to something. Locke is so composed throughout all that is going on, Hardy giving a very subtle performance leading you towards either a twist, a revelation or a coming together. Hints are thrown in, Locke having an ailment suggests it may lead somewhere.About 10 or 15 minutes out, is the gradual realisation that absolutely nothing is going to happen, there is no revelation, no hints to any resolutions, which the time frame of the film would admittedly not allow.We have merely been privy to a car journey which was like an individual episode of your run of the mill soap opera, only nothing more is to follow.Yes, Locke went through some life altering events in the course of a car journey, (most of it within the middle third) but it's whether they warranted being put to the plot of a film for entertainment or stimulation. Although, when we have had a decade and more of the public watching a group of 12 people sat in a house for 3 months, the popularity of a man sat in a car for 2 hours shouldn't come as much surprise.Even after an hour, this could have been a 7/10 or more with a well crafted resolution. It had the exact opposite.",Locke
103,ghost_dog86,More of a One-Man Off-Broadway Show than a Movie,7,4 May 2014,"These low budget, stripped down, single character dramas are really starting to become a ""thing"", aren't they? Even though (on the surface) Tom Hardy's performance carries this film, and the fact is this may be the best thing Steven Knight has ever written, the most impressive thing ""Locke"" has going for it is its direction. Using what seemed to be only two or three camera angles to capture 85 minutes of Hardy driving (most of ""Locke"" was filmed within the confines of a car) I am fascinated by the techniques used by writer/director Steven Knight, which culminated in my shocking degree of favoritism towards a movie with should have (by all accounts) been a snooze-fest.Synopsis: Ivan Locke is the site manager of a construction job who on the eve of a historically large ""pour"" (the pouring of concrete) essentially quits his job, gets into his car and begins to drive through the night towards a destination; a destination which holds a secret whose truths may see the collapse of everything good and stable in his life. The stakes begin to raise as (on the way) Ivan must make some phone calls to friends, family and employers, explaining his actions.As static as the concept of a man driving on a highway for 85 minutes may sound, I promise you that at no point will you be checking your watch, metaphorically wondering to yourself, ""Are we there yet?"" In fact, as the movie progressed, I admittedly found myself leaning forward in my seat all the more.To say this script was good enough to keep the plot progressing would be selling it a bit short. There are true moments of brilliant ""wireless"" conversational subtext. In the same breath, ""Locke"" is also a movie which at times becomes bogged down by it repetitive metaphors pertaining to concrete and construction work. By the hour mark, we get it. Some characters have strong moral foundations and others have weak moral foundations.Hardy's performance: In what is essentially Tom Hardy's one man show, he is asked to command the attention of a theater audience for 85 minutes from a seated position; a seemingly impossible task, which he does pull off. OK, so we all know that Hardy is a great actor (one of the best working today) but he should also be recognized as a physically ""powerful"" actor as well. Here's the issue: With the focal situation of this film being what it is, and the voices on the phone sounding as conversationally natural as they do, after a while it becomes apparent that Hardy's performance comes off as unnaturally forced; like someone on a dimly lit stage reciting Shakespeare to the unseen masses. This is in no way an attempt to knock Hardy's acting abilities; on some level I understand why he chose to play the character the way he does, as he is the only person on screen for 85 minutes. All I am trying to say is that maybe, just maybe (probably) Hardy was miscast here.Final Thought: I'm not saying that ""Locke"" is a grand achievement in experimental filmmaking as some critics are proclaiming. It has its flaws. The greatest being, that there is a revelation which comes to light about 20 minutes in, revealing the reason as to why Ivan is driving to begin with; a revelation that is crucial to gauging this characters moral compass. However upon hearing his reasoning, if his motives still seem strange to you, then you may find him to be more of an irritatingly prideful man than one of substance; which was undoubtedly the opposite of Knight's intent. But again, as a whole, ""Locke"" does more than simply maintain. It is far more than simply ""not boring"". ""Locke"" is 85 minutes of well paced, tension driven, well crafted filmmaking, and is worth checking out.",Locke
104,asifahsankhan,"An even more compelling answer to why Tom Hardy is ""Britain's Finest Actor at the Moment""",10,9 July 2017,"Tom Hardy's 'Locke' is an engrossing hour and a half of one man in his BMW X5. Surely, the longest BMW car commercial ever, and probably the most thrilling one, yet.One man drives from the Midlands to south London alone. On the way he spends an hour and a half on his hands-free set, talking to friends and loved ones.As movie pitches go it's not exactly Jurassic Park, but Tom Hardy's one man thriller Locke is a minimalist masterpiece that reminds you compelling filmmaking, first and foremost, is about script and performance.Jean-Luc Godard, quoting D.W. Griffith, famously proposed that ""All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun.""While ""a guy and a car"" doesn't have quite the same zip, that combination worked wonders for the new suspense drama ""Locke,"" in which Tom Hardy is the only actor who appears on screen and stays cloistered inside a speeding BMW for 85 minutes.It's the latest addition to the sub-genre of single-actor movies, which at their best demonstrate that sometimes less really is more (even in a big budget production). ""Locke"" - The title itself is stripped-down. It refers to Hardy's character, Ivan Locke, a construction site foreman on the eve of the biggest job of his career who has to juggle a series of phone calls about his family, his work and his future while driving through the night to attend to a personal commitment.Though Britain's hyper-minimalist ""Locke"" could have come off as dull or gimmicky, film critics have overwhelmingly praised Hardy's absorbing acting, Steven Knight's sure-handed direction (he also wrote the film) and cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos' inventive camera angles. The ultimate context is that the film is a 'more minute-to-minute' involving than most of the costly extravaganzas that come out the industry.Overall, it's the most brilliant piece of Cinematic creation I've ever seen and here's the intruding conscious and the kicker: An actor only activity stunt set in a single confined location, from Birmingham to London, Locke holds a total of 36 phone calls with his boss and a colleague, Donal, to ensure the pour is successful, with his wife Katrina to confess his infidelity, his son, and with Bethan to reassure her during her labour, Locke demanded a powerful performance in advance – and we get an even more compelling answer to why Tom Hardy is ""Britain's Finest Actor at the Moment"" and a generation icon, soon to be.",Locke
105,PetarNeo,Best performance by Hardy,10,2 September 2016,"After we found out that Hardy has potential to become a powerful and great actor. With this role he showed he is one of the many that is capable of doing such thing as one-person movie. His performance is exhilarating, emotional, thrilling and twisty. As he just drives and changes his life on one hour and twenty minute ride we can't but feel connected to his character. Everything is on his back, he's under pressure and that doesn't breaks him it makes him even stronger. His decisions changed him and now he must confront those decisions that he made and change his life but at the same time giving us the feeling of what is going through and all pain, lost, loneliness, sadness, happiness we can't help but feel it too. He changes emotionally and mentally while trying to be good towards his family. One night changes his life like nothing before and it's happening quickly, strongly and painfully but he copes with it and is determined to make something good out of all that. After all 1 hour and 20 min ride it left us huge feeling about everything that happened to the man behind the wheel 3.5/4",Locke

107,TuesdayThe17th,Kinda like being stuck on a 90 minute car ride...,7,30 November 2020,"The first time I saw this movie i watched it alone during the day time. It was powerful and it touched my heart. Although the entire movie takes place inside of Ivan Locke's BMW, it was a very good dialogue piece with a great turn in by Hardy. This movie is shot in the same style as the movie ""Buried"" with Ryan Reynolds and for a few years, I thought ""Locke"" was the superior film. However, after watching it last night for the second time, I felt it didn't omit the same power it did before, and I am now planning to watch ""Buried"" in the next few days to get my final say on which one is the better film. ""Locke"" has its moments. I love a good dialogue driven movie and I give credit to all types and styles of films. The problem with this movie is that there wasn't enough climatic material. There wasn't enough oomph in the storytelling believe it or not and it left the film rather repetitive. Luckily, it only clocks in at an indie length of 84 minutes so you don't lose your mind watching the inside of a car forever. There are some deep moments of emotion but, to me, the most effective part of the movie was actually the ending credits. This is because the film finally allowed itself to fully dive into some deep, sad, music for more than 5 seconds. The earlier scenes that were meant to be touching or deep weren't totally vapid, but they were too short lived every time and it was nice to see the film fall into its truest atmospheric form at the end scene. Unfortunately, it was a little too late.",Locke

It's a wonderful movie where every detail recalls of real life: Steven Knight filmed his own masterpiece and gave Tom Hardy the chance to show the world what an amazing performer he actually is.Movies like the present one make me think that films could be better than books.

110,happy_hangman,Good Drama - But Better Suited To Radio,6,15 March 2015,"Stephen Knight's 'Locke' is another film held together by a superb central performance. Tom Hardy is a reliable, honest, dedicated employee and family man whose life becomes completely unraveled during the course of a 90 minute car journey, as he tries to deal with the consequences of a single uncharacteristic act. The action - what there is of it - takes place in real time, and Hardy's (often unsympathetic) character is the only face we see throughout. The other performers (including the ubiquitous Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson, Tom Holland, and others) literally 'phone their parts in...to his Blackberry. The writing is superb, the acting exemplary and the dramatic pacing spot-on. There is only one problem...it's, at heart, a very good RADIO play. Knight tries very hard to make an hour and a half of a man behind the wheel visually engaging but...well...there's only SO much you can do with that. This becomes particularly evident during several short autobiographical monologues, which sit rather uncomfortably within the otherwise realistic narrative. I eventually sat back with my eyes closed, and enjoyed the piece even more. Still, writing of this quality is rare, so it is well worth a look...or listen!",Locke
111,somf,This did not work at all for me,5,7 May 2014,"Tom Hardy is probably my second favorite actor working today behind Daniel Day Lewis. He use to be third, but number two just OD'ed a couple months ago. To me his best work has been in BBC productions in ""Stuart a life backwards"" and The Take, but he is just brilliant in everything he has done. Perhaps his worst role was his highest profile one in the last Batman. But he did the whole thing with the mask over his face, so he is excused. The good reviews and the fact Hardy was starred had my curiosity piqued. But I was a as bored as I thought I might be, watching a guy driving in a car for 82 minutes talking on the phone. The story is not at all compelling. It is not a thriller. It is a character study. Hardy is great in his one man show,but it just totally missed for me. I didn't really believe the character. We find out why he is doing the things that he does during the course of the film, but I simply do not believe that any man would do what he is doing. For me to discuss that point further I would have to reveal spoilers and I just don't like doing that on IMDb.I think here in the states audiences will find his Welsh accent a bit difficult to comprehend at times as well.If you want to see it for the novel concept or you are a big Hardy fan, I would wait for DVD when you can turn on the subtitles.

The script is good, given the strictures of being in a car for 95% of the movie, but ultimately it is a waste of time, and the subject matter pointless.

114,lnvicta,If there were any doubts that Tom Hardy is one of the best working actors today...,9,31 May 2015,"...Locke provides irrefutable proof that he is. Tom Hardy is absolutely captivating in this role, and he has to be. It's all about his character Ivan Locke driving in a car. That's the setting. All forms of dialogue are from Locke and from calls he gets ingoing and outgoing through the car. The weird thing is, you don't even notice it after a while. Everything flows so smoothly and Tom Hardy's performance completely captures everything you'd expect from this character as he's experiencing these dilemmas - you believe every word out of his mouth and every subtle nuance in his expressions. Tom Hardy owns this movie and Locke really is the perfect vehicle (literally) for showing off his barebones acting chops.The story itself is that Ivan Locke is a construction worker who just got off his shift and is now driving back, but then gets some calls that give us insight into what he has going on in his personal life and his work life and how Locke responds to this information as it gets progressively more stressful. It's incredible that a movie at only 82 minutes can go through such a roller-coaster of emotions, and as short as it is the movie still flies by because you're so drawn to the character. One of the voices is Locke's coworker voiced by Andrew Scott (Moriarty from Sherlock) and even as a voice-over his performance is totally convincing and his back-and-forth with Hardy is electric and at times humorous. His wife and other parties bring drama into the equation and as things start falling apart for Locke it dips into psychological thriller territory.Steven Knight deserves much credit as well for having written and directed the film. It's so smooth and sleek, from the highway shots to the few overhead shots of the city at night. It's beautiful and adds the ideal atmosphere for this one-man show to maneuver in. It's a wonderfully written movie, wonderfully directed, perfectly acted (seriously, this is the performance of Hardy's career), with a spot- on supporting cast of voices. Locke is a mesmerizing movie from beginning to end. If you're a Tom Hardy fan or a fan of good cinema in general, you're doing yourself a disservice by not watching Locke.",Locke
115,lucasnochez,Film Review: Locke/www.nightfilmreviews.com,9,9 May 2014,"There comes a time, very rarely, where the term enlightened and delightful can be used in the context of a single film. Thankfully, Locke is that film. Being titled and awarding our main protagonist with the surname of one of the pioneers of the age of enlightenment, the father of classical liberalism and a philosopher who contributed endlessly to the notion of identity and that enigmatic term, 'the self', it seems only fitting to have one actor have the privilege to don John Locke's prestigious name while manoeuvring the concrete highways of Birmingham, England, and that is one of our generation's most promising talents, the one and only Tom Hardy.Navigating through what seems like an endless night of change, decision making and reflection, Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) finds himself in his sturdy four-by-four BMW Sports utility vehicle, driving to London, England on what may be one of the biggest days of his career. Ivan is a project manager, in charge of one of the biggest upcoming pours to happen in London, outside of military operations. Ivan, who seems to be dedicated to his job and fascinated with the importance of concrete, abandons his position as a worker and his responsibilities as a man, a husband, and a father, for a deep and dark secret that haunts him from his past and lingers very well to the forefront of his future.Bumper-to-bumper with endless close-ups of Hardy and various voices that flood the speakers of his vehicle through his very busy telephone bluetooth, which dictates the narrative; including his wife, voiced by Ruth Wilson (The Lone Ranger), Eddie, his son (The Impossible), coworker Donal (Andrew Scott of Saving Private Ryan), no one seems to deliver quite an emotional collision quite like Hardy does.Hardy is an exceptional actor that is fully capable of dictating the pace and flow of any film, regardless of the setting. Taking cues from previous films like Buried starring Ryan Reynolds and 127 Hours, telling the incredible true story of relentless survivor and avid life believer Aron Ralston, brought to life by James Franco, Locke is singular character driver film capturing the motions and movements of Ivan Locke. With only the glares of the reds, yellows and greens of the city lights flooding the highway, the soft and harsh whitish hues off other cars headlights and the glow coming from his dashboard, Hardy holds a film together not with his body, flashbacks or premonitions, but his face, his dialogue, the occasional cracks in his voice and the powerful tears running down his cheeks. Tom Hardy may very well look rugged, may very well be tatted up and adopt a rough around the edges acting style, but his role in Locke secures his dedication to reviving the cinematic art form and the dedication of actors found only in the golden age of cinema. If nothing else, Hardy is cemented as a staple of the promise in talent that can be found in cinema today, and Locke is a testament to this promise.At a gentle and almost unnoticed eighty-five minutes, the drive of the film is undoubtedly Hardy, but the heart lies in the tight script and direction of its fearless leader behind the lens and on the page, the uncompromising Steven Knight (Eastern Promises, Closed Circuit). Knight, who directs one of the most calm, reasonable and logically satisfying characters on film in recent memory, focuses less on spectacle and climax, and more on the reality of human beings and realistic, everyday domestic melodrama they face. Rarely are audiences' engaged in a film where the inner thoughts of its character are amplified into louder words, without a single piece of overacted dialogue. Knight succeeds in allowing the unplanned comedy and tragedy of the everyman's mundane life to entertain in Locke. Aesthetically, there is no other 'trapped in one space' film better than this one. Ironically enough, Ivan is never in one spot long enough, and implicitly, as well as explicitly, this is what drives Locke into overdrive and well beyond the expectations of its audience. Locke is a multifaceted examination of facing your demons, prioritizing your life and running as far and as fast away from the harsh realities of your past as you can. Without ever taking any easy detour from the unexpected comedy and moments that will have you chuckling your way to a swift resolution for our protagonist, Locke will amaze you despite the obstacles and many bumps along Ivan's ride.If Locke were to have been released here for the first time this year, it would undeniable been at the top of my list of best films of the year. Unfortunately, the film was released at various festivals the year prior and opened wide in its native land England before making its way to cinemas here. Thankfully, the film is making a mad dash at a theatre near you. I would recommend you speed your way to seeing Locke. Strap yourself in, put on your hazards on at every twist and turn and make sure to lock yourself in for one of the most entertaining films you will see all year. Locke breathes new life into cinema, peeling the pavement and leaving a mark of utter cinematic intensity thanks to every nuanced look, sound and word from its star, the one and only Mr. Tom Hardy.",Locke
116,priyantha-bandara,Sometimes one actor is more than enough!,8,16 August 2014,"Though every director takes a challenge when they decide to do their movie project even how big or small it is, some scripts vastly differ from the majority and they pose a stronger challenge of some sort. This is a fact for most movies that are script driven and even tougher when it comes to movies that has only one actor in them. In recent past Buried (2010) and All is Lost (2013) were fine examples of such films. And 2013 brings another fine completely script driven movie from UK which is Locke. It sure is a very different movie and maybe even if you kept the whole movie thing apart and listened to it over radio there is a fair chance that you will still get the whole thing right and enjoy it. The reason why I say so is because the only probable cause this script makes a movie because there is acting and cinematography. But it will be equally promising as a sound act only. Tom Hardy who is the one and only actor in this movie plays the character of Ivan Locke who is a construction engineer. In the brink of a historical construction event he decides to ditch it and go somewhere else to fix a mistake he have made. When he gets in to his car and starts driving he realize that there will be many challenges he have to complete to save the day and none of them will be easy as they sound. Tom does a brilliant performance here no doubt. As he is the only living thing the viewers will see he has to be compelling to keep the show going. Ivan's character is strong, intelligent, brave and calm. All these characteristics are portrayed while Ivan is seated in one place and only by talking to other people over the phone. It is too hard for me to explain how this is even possible in a movie but imagine how it could have being for Tom Hardy and Steven Knight (director/screenwriter) to make it happen. But the wonderful thing is as a movie it truly works and the viewer is anchored in one place giving only hints to imagine the things that must be going on in another place. It's kind of unfair too for us as viewers as we always expect to see what's going on but Locke doesn't give us that luxury. But it truly makes the viewer to become this character and synch in to his situation like no other movie does.Locke is a beautiful drama that tells a strong story about accepting responsibility in the most daring of times and parenthood. And it does is staying in one place using one actor. How fascinatingly fantastic!",Locke

120,TheFilmGuy1,A Man Delves Deep Into Madness As He Makes His Way To London,7,2 August 2014,"""Do it for the concrete.""Locke is a film that has quite the unique premise. Like films such as ""Buried"" or ""Exam"" this film takes place in one location, that being a car. It's a drama that can be quite intense to watch, and can even stress you out. I think it's safe to say most people have had some kind of issue occur in their life where they have had to have one or more extremely awkward or uncomfortable situation that really just stresses you out, whether it be admitting to doing something bad, or trying to plan out some kind of big event that stresses you. In this film, Tom Hardy plays a man who has to deal with both of those kinds of conversations.I think this film was advertised as some kind of thriller, and while it kind of is, it's thrilling in a different way. It's not the ""he has 4 hours before the terrorists kill his daughter"" kind of thrilling, but a more realistic kind of thrilling. His characters issues build up slowly, and you start to feel the pressure that's weighing down on his shoulders. It's quite effective in doing that. There's also a lot of little details to look into, like conversations about ""concrete"" that kind of reference to Hardy's characters mental state. It's essentially a film about a man delving deeper into madness the further he drives down the dark highway to London. The films main gimmick of it taking place in one location and all conversations being through the phone works, but it doesn't mean the film is amazing. It can be impressive, but it's not perfect. The ending is kinda weak. You can interpret it in different ways, but it just doesn't have the strength that the rest of the film has. I almost would like to see a ""phone call drama"" genre emerge from this. Imagine seeing different great actors, perhaps driving in different countries with different scenery, and with different interesting plots occurring. I need some credit for that idea if that actually happens.",Locke
121,magnuslhad,satisfying,7,23 March 2015,"A utilitarian approach to life advocates the greatest amount of happiness for the greatest amount of people. It is a logical if imperfect philosophy. The consequences of taking decisions that defy that logic are explored in Locke. Minimalist filmmaking is a hit and miss affair. Phone Booth (2002) is crippled by its monotonous arena and the lead actor's stilted performance, while Richard Linklater's Tape (2001) fails to overcome the limited dynamic range of its camera. Locke takes these challenges in its stride and hurdles them impressively. Tom Hardy is mesmerising, and the constricted setting complements the narrative of a man too buttoned up, too in control, so much so that he will only ever break his confines in an explosive, destructive manner. Here is the man of concrete, who unconsciously desires the wrecking ball. With all due respect to editors, sounds designers, directors of photography, etc., great cinema requires three elements: great script, great acting, great direction. In Locke, the script works, though the conversations with dead Dad tend to break the rhythm. Hardy is too talented to let them deflate the narrative completely, but a subtler sense of the son revisiting the sins of the father is required. Hardy is simply outstanding, as are the supporting cast of voice actors. The direction works but is obviously the most confined element. Messi playing keepy-up in a phone box is still Messi, but he needs the length of the pitch to show what he can really do. Knight handles the automobile arena well, without ever letting us forget the gimmicky nature of the premise. This project would make a great stage play, or a great radio play. But that restricted location can only ever be very good cinema. Nevertheless, Locke is a triumph.",Locke

I am a fan of Bane, I mean Tom Hardy, and always look forward to the next creative role that he takes.Unfortunately this movie is rather bland. It takes place in a car and it is interesting for the first 20 minutes of so, but it just drags on and on. He talks to multiple people on the phone, he talks to himself, and he is always looking at his rearview like someone is trying to kill him ( which doesn't happen). The story is about him going to the hospital to see someone because of something from his past.The color of the film is great, and the music is great, but unfortunately the movie is a little bit too long, even at only 85 minutes. They could have cut this down to 70 minutes and it would have had better pacing. You are literally just watching him sitting in the car for the whole movies, talking to people on the phone.

There is sustained suspense throughout the movie in that you don't know how it will end or if he will even exit his car and have a scene outside it.

126,MUFCOK,Unique Cinema. Tom Hardy gives a fantastic performance.,7,7 January 2015,"Apart from about 20 seconds at the start, the entire film is shot in the confined space of a BMW drivers seat. There is only one physical actor & about 4 different camera shots. Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke, he lives a successful life in Construction & is a dedicated family man. He is calm and collected and gives the impression that he is a man all about control. In the time it takes him to drive from Birmingham to London, his whole life changes, and you get to see how and why through various telephone calls on Bluetooth loudspeaker. Tom Hardy gives a very convincing performance and shows everybody that he is not a one trick pony and he can adapt well to different roles and scenarios. With Tom Hardy being the only star of this movie he really needed to bring a powerful performance that the audience can connect to, and he did this successfully in my opinion. The director stated that he wanted to make something completely different and fresh for mainstream cinema, there are other films out similar to this but the ones I have seen don't match up to Locke. This does feel unique and I can appreciate how making a film of this style must be challenging to make it entertaining and keep its viewers hooked. The run time is about right and at just over 80 minutes it's relatively short but I think this helps.This movie is slow paced, its one man talking on the phone for 80 minutes, so if this doesn't sound like something for you then avoid! I personally found it tense and gripping. The film didn't head in the direction I thought it would but this isn't a bad thing. It has its own unique feel and this is always something I welcome in a world of cinema that is so saturated with clichés and over told stories!When the credits rolled it did leave me thinking about the movie and had me thinking it over in my head. It actually made me feel quite emotional, this is all down to Tom Hardy and his performance. It is hard to say anything else about this movie without giving key plot points away!7/10",Locke
127,tresm87,Tom Hardy driving and talking to mumbling brits for 85 min,5,25 July 2018,"What a dull let down of a film. I expected at least a decent thrilling story but this was just Tom Hardy talking to angry British people for 85 min. If you're gonna try the one setting claustrophobic minimalist route, at least make it interesting. I love Tom Hardy but this was easily the worst thing he has ever bent apart of.",Locke
128,CowherPowerForever,Gripping Storytelling at its Finest,9,3 June 2014,"When the trailers first hit for the film you could tell this film was going to be something special. However it did leave you wondering if Tom Hardy could carry such a deep film like this. Tom Hardy easily carries this film into being one of the best films of the year 2014.Steven Knight who writes and directs this film does a fantastic job of bringing us a quick 80 minute story set in one location. The story centers on Ivan Locke(played by the amazing Tom Hardy) a construction site manager who is trying to get a major building built. The story has a few nice twist and turns to keep you in your seat and excited for the entire 80 minute run time of the film. There have been many types of films like this over the years, for example Phone Booth and more recently Buried. This film far exceeds both of these, and it is not even close. Tom Hardy is the center point of the story as it follows his life as it begins to fall part more so than ever over the course of the film. Locke decides to drive out of his way, and not home to his wife and kids. Later we find out that this is because on a recent business trip he actually cheated on his wife with another woman, and now that woman is pregnant with his child. She decides she wants to keep the child, and Locke wants to be a better person, and decides it is best to go be with her. As well a big job with the building is set in place for the next morning however he bails on his duties there to be with his new baby. I won't go into the entire piece by piece of the story, but needless to say there is a lot more to keep you interested in this film.As I mentioned above, Steven Knight also directs this film as well. While the film mainly just focuses on Locke, there are some nice high rise shots of the highways he is driving on. In a film like this acting is very important and Knight gets everything and then some out of Tom Hardy. If you didn't think Tom Hardy was an elite actor before this film, you should now. He proves it without a doubt. There are also a handful of voice actors who pop up from time to time. These actors and actresses all work perfectly with Tom Hardy to make the film that much more interesting.Overall this is a must see film. Tom Hardy dominates his role in the film, and if you enjoy a small film with with no action at all, that can at times feel slow, but picks back up with deep story pieces, then this is a film you will not want to miss. Not to mention, in my opinion, this is one of the best films of 2014, and will likely stay in that top list for the rest of the year.9/10",Locke
129,eryui,An addictive framework,8,1 May 2016,"This movie is like when you read a book. You create most of the characters involved and the locations through the talks of a single actor.It is an in depth character study, during a real time short trip. The fact is that the situations who involve the protagonist, a rational engineer who face same ethical problems, his struggle to be different from his dead father, it is quite interesting and moving enough to get you involved.The set is practically inside a car and I have to admit I was surprised it didn't bore me at all. The slight and beautiful soundtrack matches perfectly and interrupts harmoniously the slow pace. The script and the acting are flawless and surely the Hardy presence helps a lot.It is another kind of movie, minimalist, elegantly executed. Very gripping if you are in the mood, such is to ""read"" a book in silence.8/10",Locke
130,The-Social-Introvert,An engrossing,8,18 September 2014,"Similarly to films like Carnage and the wonderful 12 Angry Men, Locke pretty much takes place within a confined setting. In this case, a building site manager's car journey on the motorway from Brighton to Croydon. In this everyday-like journey that he will be sharing with millions of people in the country, he makes a phone call or gets a call every so often. And that's it. That's all that happens in this movie. And it's a beautiful thing. Over the last nine years Ivan Locke has ensured his life is as solid as the concrete he pours. The married father of two has only made one mistake in his relatively normal life. It is this mistake that causes the world around him to crumble. His job. His marriage. And all he can do is keep driving. Keep making phone calls. Keep moving. As Ivan Locke, Tom Hardy, known for his breakthrough blockbuster performances in Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, swaps Batwing for BMW and delivers a captivating performance. It's no easy task being the only actor in the movie, but Hardy has proved that he will be able to take on some big challenges after what I consider a very effective performance. The London-born actor achieves more with a single daunting or exasperated expression than others would in a whole movie. You could feel the lump in his throat as he explained to his wife that he'd made a baby with another woman. You could see the guilt and genuine 'what-have-I-done' thoughts going through his head. The conversations with his ""dad"" in the back seat could have come off as laughable if performed by a lessor actor, but here it was powerful and relatable. I wasn't too sure about the accent at first – I though he was trying to sound like he was from the subcontinent, but I got used to it. The voice action from the supporting cast, especially Locke's wife, was also top-notch and very believable. Locke's experiences in his life has made him unrelenting in his beliefs that he has to and is doing the right thing (that is, driving to the birth of his illegitimate child whilst explaining to his wife on the phone, instead of staying the building site on one of the most important days of his company's history). It really a testament to Hardy's ability that he can make you (well me, anyhow) both empathise and sympathise with a man who has essentially betrayed both his family and his company. I really did feel for Locke, all alone and frustrated, without the ability to stop the vastly-changing events around him from happening. I also felt for him as a man, because I'm sure a lot of guys have been in similar positions and there are those like Locke that sincerely regret their actions. And I sure as hell wouldn't want to be in Locke's position. Director and screenwriter Steven Knight provides us with fantastically realistic dialogue character actions, in regards to what they say and how they say it. An example would be when Locke's son uses the discussions of the live football with his father to mask his sadness over his mother's crying. No son likes to see his mother crying, especially if he doesn't know why. By far the most interesting interactions were between Locke and his wife, who is unable to control her shock. If I was forced to name a flaw in the screenplay it would be that it does take quite a coincidence that the woman Locke had sex with goes into labour around the same time that the most important concrete placement in his company's history is about to take place. Huge chunks of dialogue and conversations are split between shots of the motorway and other cars, allowing the audience to ponder on what they have just heard from the characters. It also gives us an opportunity to contemplate just what is going on in the lives of all the people in the other vehicles. Locke is truly a solid example in just how engrossing minimalistic cinema can be. I can't fathom how people could find it boring, other than the fact that they were possibly hoodwinked by explosive marketing (I don't know, as I didn't watch a trailer of the film). The movie feels fresh and never outstays its welcome. I guess the ending could have been stretched to show a few events further down the line but that would end up defeating the purpose of the exercise and breaking the tight, solid shell the film has. The tension and drama present is nerve-wrecking, without the use of murder or mystery as a plot device. Locke is a film I'm sure every working- class person can relate to in some way, even if it's not by the actions of the characters. It's a movie that's so down to earth for once. And who would have thought with a change of car indication from left to right (or was it the other way around?) a man so successful could lose his wife, his children, his house and his job, all for the sake of doing the right thing.",Locke
131,The_moan_of_all_moans,Locke the door and throw away the key.,2,24 April 2014,"""Gripping"", ""Compelling"", ""Genuinely Moving"", ""Suspenseful"". Just some of the words of acclaim this film has attached to it. It has garnered an array of affirmation, and supposedly gets the heart pumping. Did it get my heart pumping? Was I in suspense? Was I moved? Did I find it compelling? The answer to all of those is....NO!!! A resounding NO. I knew what it was about, and i had no qualms about its simplicity, but how anyone found this riveting baffles me. Tom Hardy is an exceptional actor, i will never question that and even in this dull, pointless story he does a solid job, but his ability to have a Russian, Welsh and English accent all at once doesn't save this film. The in car phone ringing 300 times, i mean why does he have to let it ring? He's going to bloody answer it, why wait 3 bloody rings to press a button in your car!!!!!!. Did he need to compose himself before EVERY phone call? It was infuriating. Then there's the conversations between him and his son about a football game; why would you be so mysterious about a football game? Is it because the budget of this film only covered gas and a phone bill? That they couldn't say the teams name?Yes the film is unique, and there probably (and hopefully) wont be another like it. But that doesn't stop it from being completely pointless. The story so uninteresting, i felt no sympathy, that was replaced by apathy. I did not care about any of the voices or Hardy's character. Basically everything was his own fault. There was no real justification. Was i supposed to empathize with his situation, when he's having his little meltdown and trying to justify why he has chose this. I couldn't have cared less. Fellow motorists matching his mood didn't make me appreciate it either. It was slow, annoying, very annoying, and most of all pointless.",Locke

133,shweta-51657,Well written slow burner chamber play that envelops the viewer,8,13 March 2019,"This is a very well written and artfully directed movie by Steven Knight. He has masterfully directed a single actor in the lonesome and many a times confiinig space of a car. The audience only sees Tom Hardy in the entire duration of the film and observes his descent from a well composed gentlemen to someone on the verge of having his entire life changed in the course of a single evening.I dont believe this movie will sit well with the usual popcorn audience as it requires someone who can appreciate how the confines of the car begins to close in on Hardy and how he unravels with each Bluetooth call. The movie although not loud or flashy is entirely captivating as you sit and await the next disaster in this man's life.
This movie reminds us once again that Tom Hardy is a very talented actor. We are so accustomed to seeing him as manic and hulking overbearing characters, it is entirely refreshing to see him in this role where most of his emotions are inwardly directed and display steely calm but with a broken vulnerability as the movie goes on.
The ending does leave the viewer wondering about the ultimate and final fate of the protagonist which makes me think I will be thinking about this movie for days to come.",Locke

Its a movie in a unusual format with just the one on screen actor at any time and theres very little going on other than the drama unravelling before your eyes. The moments in which you learn his story are told to a tee and Hardys performance is fantastic to say the least. Its a simple story and on paper it doesn't look very interesting so how its so captivating is really hard to describe other than its well made. Im not overly keen on the way he related to his father or the way the movie ended as it didn't seem satisfying enough, the movie deserved more however this is a very good drama which is hard to recommend to anyone unless they really appreciate film and how its made.",Locke

136,verna-a,How to keep your head while all about you..,8,14 May 2019,"While I'm not sure I would have watched this film had I read the synopsis beforehand, I found it had surprising power derived from suspense and frustration. So those of you who have decided to read reviews beforehand have made the wrong decision, sorry! As other reviews explain it consists of nothing but car driving and phone conversations as one man accepts the need to travel by road to London to deal with the consequences of a past mistake, even though it means the loss of his marriage and his job. The protagonist is in a painful situation where his decision about the ethical thing to do, upsets and outrages just about everyone else. Yet he never wavers from his decision, and explains himself and deals with situations over the phone mostly with reasonableness and restraint. In contrast to this are his emotional ""soliliquies"" addressed to the person of his dead father which balance out his character. He emerges as a person of considerable gifts and ethical stature. Although his present life is well down the toilet the viewer can't help feeling he will fight his way up again. In contrast to the hero's character, everyone else in his life is either frail, needy, inadequate or unreasonable. Although in retrospect I can fully accept and praise this film, during the watching of it I have to admit I was tormented by the craving for him to reach a destination, and/or rip the phone out and chuck it. I also feared a traffic accident due to his fatigue and at times inattentive driving. The writer/director knew better than me, and avoided such distractions. Congratulations to all involved, for this tour-de-force.",Locke

They're similar in the sense that we never leave their character and anyone else they speak to is only on the phone. The similarities are few besides that but I think if you enjoy one then the other should work for you.The plot isn't dense but I appreciated how they do not hold your hand through what is happening. The characters he speaks to are revealed through normal conversation. These 2 points are important to note because the trend lately seems to be towards way too much exposition and treating the audience as idiots.Visually the movie works well without trying too hard. No there isn't drone shots of the highway or GoPro cameras mounted everywhere. It's mostly a handful of angles showing the road inside the car, Locke (Tom Hardy) as he makes his way to his destination.I do recommend this movie if only to see something a little different than the average movie without being an art-house film.",Locke

139,aldri-feb,A tense drama that is determined by remarkable one-man-show performance from Tom Hardy,8,25 April 2014,"Actually the conflict in ""Locke"" is a daily mistake that could happen to anybody. Perhaps what makes this movie worth to see was the way Steven Knight directed it with minimalist concept and smart script which unreasonably keep audience interested seeing a man talking to his relatives on the phone while driving car at steady speed throughout 85 minutes length. And of course there is Tom Hardy, the soul and 'the man of the match' of this film. He succeeded to carry the whole scenes alone as Ivan Locke, a man who is responsible to pay consequences he had done and confident to manage all screw things back in a right place. With magnetic and groundbreaking performance in ""Locke"", Tom Hardy proves his ability as a talented actor and hopefully pushes him not to choose safe role. Overall, ""Locke"" is a brave film-making that more or less saved by Steven Knight's brilliant idea and an emotional one-man-show performance by Tom Hardy and could be the most memorable single location thriller since ""Buried"".",Locke

Critics starved of ""less"" have gone into a feeding frenzy and pulled out the ""less is more card"" - one that has been burning a hole in their pocket. This is, however, no Stalker (Tarkovsky) and the use of said card appears more out of desperation than of relevance.Locke neither asks nor answers any great question (a reasonable prerequisite for 85 minutes of boredom). There is plenty of risk taken in the making of the film, risk that in itself is worthy of praise. Unfortunately risk, by definition, is not its own reward. If Locke has any redeeming qualities, they are beyond my level of comprehension. In my world; the manuscript is mediocre, the acting is great and the film is pretentious rubbish.",Locke
141,axapvov,Be A Man,7,3 March 2015,"One-location films are a challenge for screenwriters. Other aspects of film- making are so conditioned that there isn't really much you can do. You might throw some transitions shots now and then or get crafty with the editing but not much more. The acting, though, is crucial as the number of characters is limited, but no actor could lift a poor script in these conditions. This kind of films are all about screen writing. Limiting the characters freedom of movement to the extreme while keeping the action thrilling, the tension growing and the characters engaging is definitely a risky experiment, but for that same reason, appealing, tempting and worth giving it a shot.Steven Knight has succeed at writing one, and then was lucky enough to have Tom Hardy rising up to the occasion and making the whole thing shine.The drive to London is thrilling and as I watched I found myself more than once ¨in distress¨, as you hear the main character Ivan Locke say more than often. There's enough going on to keep the audience engaged, in fact, there is so much going on that Locke's charisma comes precisely from his ability to handle it the way he does. Familiar and work issues arise at once from one single decision that pushes him to drive through the night while managing it all with only the help of a phone and colossal patience and composure. Ivan Locke stays solid, but perfectly human. His motivations, his strength, his reasoning are all well explained, both efficiently and beautifully, and the phone calls follow without losing the rhythm at any point. The film manages to get your mind in and out of the car at will, while keeping events flowing and characters growing, and all is backed up by a very interesting dilemma.The plot is solid. Tom Hardy is flawless.",Locke

It's thinking outside of the box - stripping down action for substance. It's also very risky to do this as a movie. For me it delivers because Tom Hardy is outstanding as Ivan Locke. His story unfolds through a series of dramatic phone calls. You can sense his growing tension as he struggles to stop himself completely unravelling throughout the journey. What struck me the most about this movie was that it didn't need any action to make it's story hit home. Hardy shows Locke as a man in great turmoil, trying to do what he thinks is right. His understated portrayal conveys the very real emotional stress and strain that we all experience in the modern world. As he struggles to control his world that is spinning out of control I couldn't help but root for him because the message that I got from watching it is that no matter who we think we are we are all ultimately human - fallible, fragile and vulnerable.",Locke

147,j-madej,Great British drama which is worth to see for Hardy's performance alone.,8,27 October 2014,"It is extremely hard to make a movie based in one location. Further more, it is even more difficult to create a movie with only one actor present on the screen and it is extraordinary if the film is made in real time, meaning from the moment the film begins till the end of the final credits we are observing a melt down of one individual who lets us understand what is happening in his life only with the phone calls he makes in his car. In a nutshell this is what ""LOCKE"" a film by Steven Knight is all about. ""Ivan Locke, a dedicated family man and successful construction manager, receives a phone call on the eve of the biggest challenge of his career that sets in motion a series of events that threaten his careful cultivated existence.""For any movie to work you need to make sure that our protagonist always is struggling with adversities on a highest level. The high stakes are a must for the engagement of the audience in the story put forth by the director how ever improbable. If we want to watch ordinary stories we would go to our local market and watch normal life occur, or you can paint the wall and watch the paint dry. We go to the cinema as a form of escapism, that for 2 hours allows us to disconnect from the reality of our own lives and get lost in the theater of make-believe. It is extraordinary when we are in a car with our protagonist and somehow we are truly entertained by the drama that is created when his life takes turn for worse. Lets be honest here ""LOCKE"" in a larger sense is a tour de force of excellent Tom Hardy who gives depth onto the choices he makes as the construction manager Ivan Locke who's life falls apart in front of us. Acting is reacting and it is extremely difficult to act only using auditory stimuli, but this is what happens in ""LOCKE"". The whole film consists of phone call conversations of our protagonist with people who are participating in his meltdown as he is driving the car. There is no clear antagonist here unless you would consider the highway or the time to be the obstacle for our character to struggle with.Yet the acting is so rich in internal dialogue that we are truly engaged into the drama Mr. Locke is going through. Tom Hardy really delivers one of the best underplayed, multi-layered performance in his career. Apparently ""LOCKE"" had an unconventional shooting schedule were Tom Hardy filmed his part in 6 days, shooting the movie twice per night as it was filmed in a single take. The other actors were in a hotel room, speaking on the phone with Hardy, who was on location. This created sense of reality anticipation and drama that was extremely realistic. The big credit should also go to director of photography Haris Zambarloukos who by adding filters on the lenses created beautiful light flares that visually create an aesthetically pleasing light ballet show that added additional atmosphere to otherwise repetitive camera setups. I liked ""LOCKE"" a lot and in fact I saw it twice already and for the movie that is based inside of a car, director Steven Knight must have done something right to keep me engaged and I promise you will be too. Great British drama which is worth to see for Hardy's performance alone.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",Locke
148,asandor,A unique experience carried by the main actor,7,31 December 2020,"OVERVIEW: I felt this film deserved a 7/10:
+a powerhouse performance by Tom Hardy
+an interesting plot and script
+they made an interesting movie that takes place 100% in a car - quite the feat
+a thrilling series of events that are moving and thought provoking
-the location gets a bit old
-some of the script sounds a little to dramatic and lacks genuineness from the supporting castMy thoughts on the film:A powerhouse performance from Tom Hardy, cementing him in my mind as an actor to watch. This film is carried by his performance as a man driven by doing the right thing, not matter what it costs him. This film had some moments that I would describe as 'toxic masculinity' -carrying burdens, self sacrificing etc. - all traits that many and most (myself included) would find noble, although the results cause pain for many of those around him. This film had such a genuine performance from the lead.The other interesting point here was the location and setting of the film - a car. Locke never leaves the car, never sees another human in person for the duration of the film, and there are no cutaways to memories or the like. This movie is purely a one man show, with the rest of the actors calling in (literally). This movie was interesting in its production, and certainly exceedingly unique. Definitely worth a watch if any of the above sounds interesting - I certainly enjoyed my time with it.",Locke

But 'Locke' has no proper storyline, and only 1 character of Tom Hardy. Throughout the film he's driving and speaking on the phone with various other characters.Tom Hardy gives a good performance just the storyline is not good enough. Actually there is no story. It might be a good idea to try something different by having just one character being shown in the film. But that good idea couldn't make a good film.At times, despite the film is just 80 minutes odd long, seems lengthy enough. Nothing happens in the film actually. You think something might happen next, but not. In the last 15 minutes actually I didn't care I just fast forwarded and put an end to the misery.I still give it 4/10 for Tom Hardy's good performance.

151,hou-3,A little masterpiece,9,19 April 2016,"I am actually astonished that a film like Locke could be made, given that it breaks all the rules. The entire movie is set in a car and features just one visible actor. It adheres rigidly to the Aristotelian theory of drama - that the action should happen in real time and in a single location. Tom Hardy has to shoulder the entire burden of this ascetic framework and he does it magnificently well, convincing us of the authenticity of the stoical protagonist, a calm and focused figure at the heart of nail-biting professional tension and raging personal storms. Writer Steven Knight does not only give his viewers a highly unusual and distinctive movie, he also builds it around a theme that flies in the face of contemporary mores. In a meretricious age, when we expect as a matter of course that public figures will lie, be corrupt and self-serving, he offers us a genuine hero, a man who resolves to do the right thing, no matter what it costs him - and it looks likely to cost him job, marriage and home. Locke's steely fortitude is on a classical scale, in fact it is awesome how he deals with crisis after crisis in the course of his drive south. Locke is a brilliant piece of work, which deserves all the praise it has received for its inventive technique, intelligent and emotionally charged script and fascinating subject.",Locke

Tom Hardy continues to impress as the actor who completely engulfs the character - flawlessly! 
There are several points along the plot when I worry things won't work out for this man, who's trying so steadfastly to do what's right. Virtually everyone is hurt along the way but forward he must plod, thanks to a faithless father whose shoes he swears he'll never walk in. 
This film is as much about the testament of how our parents affect our entire lives, well and long after childhood, as it is about doing the right thing. This is something hardwired into his psyche; he has no choice, just as he has no choice but to see to conclusion the project on the job he's SPOILERS! Just been fired from. 
His choices would make good conversation. Would you do what he does? Would you have the conviction? Could you even do it and risk all? Definitely something to consider. 
I recommend this film enthusiastically! Enjoy!",Locke

Hardy is excellent throughout this one man performance and on the whole Locke managed to retain a good pace despite the completely confined structure.There's something very meta about the whole film, being the ultimate character study but also the ultimate examination of an actor. There is nowhere to go and nothing to take in but Tom Hardy.This definitely won't be everyone's cup of tea and it's not one I could watch all the time but certainly interesting and a bit different.",Locke

It's about construction manager Ivan Locke (played by Tom Hardy) dealing with life changing events in one car ride. Tom Hardy is the only actor we see on screen and we never leave the car. This minimalist film may not sound interesting to some, but it's an exciting film.Tom Hardy carries the film very well and keeps us engaged for the films 85 minute runtime. Hardy plays the everyman for once and has a great use of subtlety. It's a brilliant performance that should not be missed. Knight's writing is also effective. I don't think I've heard concrete talked about so poetically before. He builds the story up well and in a realistic manner. By the end of it, though, I felt like there was something missing. I thought it would keep going and then it ended. Maybe that's how it's suppose to feel. We watch a man whose in an in- between state as he pushes forward, but wants to look back. I think this is one of the strongest films of the year so far. It can feel slow at times, but thanks to a well-written script from Knight and a great performance by Hardy, ""Locke"" works.",Locke
159,CharlieGreenCG,A lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.,10,31 December 2013,"A surprise at the 57th London Film Festival. A film where the whole story takes places inside the confines of a car, and with Tom Hardy as the one-man star. But just how well does it work?Tom Hardy, known best for majors roles in The Dark Knight Rises and Inception drops the theatricality and larger than life appearances and takes on the role of average man Ivan Locke, a building site manager, who over the past nine years has made his life as solid as the concrete he is in charge of pouring. Concrete is his religion. On the eve of the biggest job yet, also Europe's largest ever - we follow his car journey from Brighton to Croydon as the world around him slowly crumbles and he loses it all.British Screenwriter and Director Steven Knight, brings us yet another gripping British drama, after previously making Hummingbird starring Jason Statham earlier this year. Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Locke is refreshingly short and never over stays its welcome. The narrative is actually so constant that even when Hardy is not in hands- free phone switchboard mode, we capture another underlying story. Locke provides just as much a character journey as it does a car journey.During the recent UK Premiere, producer Paul Webster recalls his initial talks with Steven Knight, in which he said; 'I want to do something quite different, in a confined space, about a guy whose life changes during the course of one car journey. And we never leave the car.' And that is literally what happens. Bringing an ideal mix of humour and emotion to the project, Hardy's taunt performance is mesmerizing. The put-on Welsh accent is pretty decent also. Filmed in just eight nights and with very low budget, the film is literally a lesson of how unique and quite fantastic minimalist cinema can be.",Locke
160,anthonymora2,Locke Review,9,29 September 2014,"It saddened me when I noticed that when a majority of people see that a movie takes place in once location the entire time it's looked at as being boring and dumb. LOCKE, starring TOM HARDY, is one of those one location movies and if my word actually matters to anyone, this movie is neither boring or dumb. In fact,it might just be the most thrilling movie I've seen all year.TOM ""Bane"" HARDY,plays Ivan Locke, a very successful construction manager who is about to supervise of a new,historic construction project.On the night before that project he gets a alarming phone call from a woman who's having his child.Ivan then drops everything,from his work deadline to meeting up with his wife and kids to watch a football game,gets in his car and drives for an entire movie length to be there for this stranger woman's birth.A lot of you may be seeing this movie the wrong way already but BELIEVE ME,there's soo much more to this movie and the tital character of Ivan Locke that I don't wanna spoil for you guys.YES,this entire movie takes place in Locke's car and his only ways of communication with other characters are through phone calls via the car phone in the dashboard.You gotta respect the technicle work that has to be put into making an entire movie like this,sure it's nothing but shots of TOM HARDY'S face and some shots of London's late night highways but it really adds to the power the movie's storytelling.Again, without giving too much away,this man goes through A lot of difficult and somewhat hopeless,personal obstacles in such a short amount of time.The fact that the movie takes place in a man's car really brings a claustrophobic choke when the movie's drama really picks up.The script also makes me forget the whole one location thing,as the dialog between characters feels so genuine and real,you get sucked into the situation going on in each phone call it's really impressive.TOM HARDY is the only face in this movie and,DUDE,talk about screen presence!Mr.Hardy,goes from he who broke Batman's spine to giving award worthy stuff here.His performance goes through so many ranges of emotion,and he pulls it off so well.Especially when you see just what his character has to go through.One minute,Ivan can be the chillest dude ever,THERAPEUTIC EVEN!However,it IS awesome to see how he transitions from calm demeanor to having intense arguments with people who may or may not be present with him.It's really an amazing one man show.The movie seems simply made on the surface,but it's a really smooth looking technical achievement.The use of street lights continuously glowing over every shot are beautiful,the music also fills every scene perfectly to fit each tone.If you have any sort of appreciation for innovative film making or really great acting I don't see why LOCKE wouldn't appeal to you.It's beautifully shot and expertly acted, I GIVE IT MY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION! BUY THIS MOVIE! 9/10",Locke
161,welshnew50,"mostly what you might imagine if hearing it's all shot inside a car, but some skill demonstrated",4,5 January 2019,"I did not think i would spend any of my own time watching this movie, and in terms of how much can you give a movie set entirely at a car on a highway, in terms of its overall production effort / setting-a-scene ... unlike a movie with more/enough memory sequences that are proper cut-aways, i can't give this movie what a full on epic panorama movie with effort everywhere, can potentially get when everything's right...but... the controlled face and voice acting of the main chr , saves this movie from being little more than a demonstration piece worthy of being for a museum or neo-modern shorts film festival type, and i would not be able to disagree with someone if they said it should be shorter, and a shorts-short... for exactly that,and, the writing of the realistic in some ways , unfortunate & too?coincidental/melodramatically-simplistic dialogue between him and his wife / one-night workmate ... also does a reasonably good job of getting you to imagine the scenes he's imaging, as he tries to re-set himself emotionally each time he has to shift back to what he only can, imagine, without being there, successfully.that in a nutshell, is the entire movie, really - you might feel more for what happens to him, from similar experience , but there's not necessarily much to care about, of the chrs, in any sense of a developed chr, OTHER, than him, which usually does not work in a long movie, especially one with INFERRED relationships, but with so much time of the movie spent on emotional strain on him, but none on them, one might only feel something for WHAT, happens to the others in the plot... and that for a movie, which are visual, primarily, also limits it.also, unnecessary amounts of lights-in-the-background moving shots from just outside the window were distracting more-so than hypnotising.However one moment near to the end of it, is reasonably well written / produced , in terms of different things happening in different places, simultaneously, in a moment with only this guy as the common link... in his home, the choices of behaviour of his family members, of interest to perhaps only those interested in psychology... but if you've a very visual memory/imagination , might also spark wonder about subconscious decision making, when it comes to birth and gestation ... the strain / a few moments of slight surprise, on the guy's face, is quite carefully acted, so that got it another star for me.",Locke

Ok the first thing I have to say is Tom Hardy's performance. HE'S SOOO GOOD IN THIS MOVIE.
This is one of those movies where u just feel for the main character. Almost everything is going wrong for him. His really in a tight spot in almost every moment in this movie. I actually felt like I was in a car while watching this movie.

164,grantbullert,"A Heavy, Authentic Film",8,6 January 2019,"""Locke"" is a film that hits deeply and has completely raw emotion. It is one of the simplest ideas, but it makes an incredible impact.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The story that takes place in this film is one of the most believable of any story ever told. Everyone has made a phone call in the car and lost where they were because of how consuming the phone call is. There is so much depth to the point of Locke's life we are introduced to that we can't help but be drawn in. The direction from Steven Knight brought forth excellent performances and wonderfully timed drama all throughout the film. It all feels very real. *Editing/Cinematography: It is difficult to keep a film interesting when the entirety of the story takes place in a confined space. That being said, the editing and cinematography work together beautifully to keep the interest and tell a story all throughout the film. The work of cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos is dark, beautiful, and thought-provoking. He chose to shoot many shots through the reflections of mirrors and car windows, which was a nice tie-in to the fact that Locke was being very reflective of his life throughout the film. *Dialogue/Acting: Both of these categories felt very raw and authentic. There was nothing fancy about he dialogue, it was just raw emotion letting out the first words that came to mind from many frustrated people. The acting is phenomenal. Tom Hardy gives one of the greatest performances of his career. The voice acting of everyone over the phone holds up, too. *Music/Sound: The music is not a focus of this film, but it carries the film from scene to scene and breaks up the silent moments. The sound design is wonderful. It was unnoticeable, and for that reason it felt like they truly were on the highway. It was easy to believe all throughout the film. *Production Design/Special Effects: This is not a major part of the film, due to the fact that it all takes place in a car. But that being said, I never felt that they were in a studio. It feels completely authentic.*Conclusion: ""Locke"" is one of those films you just need to see to truly understand. It is a great example of what minimalist cinema can achieve. It is not grand or eloquent, but it is one of the most real films you will ever see.",Locke
165,beastiex,Disappointing,4,30 June 2021,"Was recommended by a friend to watch this,well i will never listen to him again. At first i was intrigued to see where this was going but when it finished my reaction was is that it? All in all a waste of 90minutes of my life.",Locke
166,johnnymurphy15,"A gripping, minimalist thriller which i more of a novelty experience.",6,30 April 2014,"Locke is one of those films that is difficult to explain without making it sound boring. After I've explained the basic plot, my usual response is 'So it's just a man in a car talking on the phone? That's it?' I respond by explaining that it has the minimalist approach similar to films like 'Phone Booth' and 'Buried' and has thematic links to 'All is Lost' and 'Gravity'; the theme of dealing with the multitude of problems life throws at you. That generally wins them over! It may lack the visuals of the latter movies, but makes up for it with the use of dialogue set pieces which gradually builds up and comes to a head.Tom Hardy is the only person you see throughout the entire film. He plays Ivan Locke, the man in the drivers seat speaking on his hands-free set while making a drive from Brighton to Croydon. He has to get to a hospital where his mistress Bethan is giving birth to his child. She is distressed and afraid and Locke is determined to get there to see the child. He has made a decision based on the principle that he had a one night stand with her and now the resulting child is his fault and he has to do what is right. While this is happening, he has to deal with a huge concrete delivery for one of the most historic pours in Europe. He has made the decision not to be there as he wants to be with the new born child. He tries sorting out the preparations for delivery through his drunken assistant Donal, and has to deal with his angry boss, who apparently is having a hard time from the top men in Chicago. He loses his job, but is still determined to sort out the delivery and the pour anyway to follow through his principles. He also has to tell his wife about the affair and the resulting baby, which she does not take very well. There are many calls which he has to make, and many calls which he receives about those three problems which he has to deal with almost simultaneously. The limitations of space in the car he is driving in provides the claustrophobia and the tension and anxiety experienced by Locke.The phone conversations are occasionally broken up by musical interludes showing the passage of time and Tom Hardy's monologues directed to his absent father he imagines to be seated at the back. These monologues are surprisingly dark and full of vitriol to this absent figure who spent his lifetime evading responsibility. He is determined not to make the same mistake with this child and wants to stand behind his decision and wills himself to make everything work at the end of the night. He seems to be a perfectionist who has lead a very organised life. He uses concrete or building analogies to explain his situation. For example, 'One crack and the whole building could come crashing down' explaining his affair and the potential damage to his life.The film shows a man constantly trying to find a solution to these mounting problems which become progressively exacerbated with each call. A strong will and an ability to solve complicated problems under a limited time-frame with limited communication is what is required of Locke, very much unlike his apparently useless father. Whatever life throws your way, if you take responsibility and take charge of the situation, things will work out. Of course there is a sacrifice. While many of his problems were worked out, unfortunately his family situation is looking like it is coming to a close due to his decision. Sometimes decisions are made which have negative consequences, but the ending is hopeful with the arrival of new life.It is a nice experiment with an effective use of dialogue to create tension, excitement and sometimes unease. Using what seems to be a normal everyday man dealing with domestic problems gives a level of believability (although I don't know if all these conclusions can possibly be reached in a 2 hour car journey). Tom Hardy gives a solid performance in what is a difficult role. Apparently he receives these calls while he is actually driving, providing more realism needed for this simple premise. For me, the film seemed like a novelty experience where you enjoy for what it is, but I can't see it being a particularly memorable one. It does not seem like a film that is for multiple viewings, but still a solid effort. Binging concrete to a mainstream audience is quite an achievement in itself.See my reviews - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com",Locke

168,timmyhollywood,Brilliant until the ending,7,14 August 2018,"All of the other reviews here cover the reasons to praise this film - the writing, the acting, the visual creativity. How do you make a story compelling for 90 minutes when it's one man alone in a car? You do it like this - plausible drama that builds in an organic way, with just enough backstory and circumstance to make your main character likable despite the mess he's gotten into. Unfortunately, that plausibility grinds to a screeching halt in the last few minutes of the film. The main and unforgivable mishap (SPOILER ALERT) is that Locke's mistress goes from debating whether or not to let the doctors perform surgery on her, to having the Cesarean, to then calling Locke with a crying baby in the background all in less than fifteen minutes. WHAT?? Maybe there have been massive advancements in medicine since one of my children was born this way, but a tooth-pulling takes longer, for Pete's sake. And maybe I'm being too critical, but everything else rang true and felt carefully constructed until this last bit, this awful punt.",Locke
169,Waerdnotte,Interesting but ultimately unsustainable,5,27 April 2014,"Director Stephen Knight has crafted something quite special and different in Locke, and it is in no small part due to support from Tom Hardy as the titular Ivan Locke, cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos and composer Dickon Hinchcliffe. The premise is interesting and its execution is as engaging as a film played out in a single space could possibly hope to be. However, for me Knight has overlooked a major point of cinema; it is a visual medium, and no amount of sweeping out-of-focus car headlights can hide the fact that 85 minutes of Tom Hardy on the phone is pretty much unsustainable as a piece of cinema.Tom Hardy is engaging and succeeds in making us believe in Ivan as a character, however, the disembodied voices of the other characters reveals Locke to be nothing more than a radio play, none of the other actors manage to get beyond the voice acting that is a mainstay of BBC Radio 4 plays.However, it's good to see a British director and his team trying something different and kudos to Hardy for putting his name to something so non Hollywood. Locke is definitely worth watching, particularly on the big screen, but for me it doesn't quite cut the mustard.",Locke

The whole film centres on his supposed virtue signalling about ""being there"" at the birth of his progeny from a one night stand. He sacrifices the social and emotional wellbeing of his existing family (including children) for a whiny, needy, woman whom he impregnated. He also let down his colleagues and workmates on a critical life changing job. Why did he do this? I honestly have no idea. It is so illogical. He did it because he thought it was morally right to be present at the birth of his new offspring. But there is another appropriate philosophical response- it is called consequentialism- attending to his family and colleagues is more important because of the harm caused to more people than this one woman.

Nothing else happens, except constant phone calls. Yet it grips and holds the attention. With patience and a willingness to watch, it sweeps a viewer along. I now know C6 is a mix of concrete, a mix so critical that the foundations of a fifty five storey building will fail if it goes off as C5, and that the police, councils and people around the world are all involved in getting a flow of concrete right.

He does this while driving normally down the expressway. That literally is the entire movie. I am not kidding. About the only thing I came away from this movie feeling was how a person might feel driving when they are having a bad day.What is so bad about this movie are the major review comments on the movie box with words such as ""thrilling"" and ""suspenseful"". I kept waiting for 84 minutes for something to happen. This movie was completely deceptive in terms of what I thought I was buying.Here is what this movie is good for. With April Fool's day approaching find someone and give them this movie with the box(so they read the major review comments too). Then tell them that this movie is fantastic and kept you on the edge of your seat while the time flew by. Then call them later to find out how much they liked the film.

189,jonruff108,I feel inclined to add my two cents...,9,6 August 2014,"Let me get straight to the point...I loved this movie. I thought it really showed the magic of film making when done right. Tom Hardy delivered an outstanding performance; I really can't say enough about it. It's too bad that the Oscars won't pay any attention to him (lets be honest here, it's the Oscars...). If people still doubted Tom Hardy this is the performance to shut them down,The cinematography was great and (somehow) kept inventing new shots to use over the course of 85 minutes of watching a man talk in his car. This was something that really kept the movie moving forward and made it ""un-boring.""However, I think the real winner here is the actual story and character of Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy). While his situation may be a little extreme for some, it's something that is relatable to everyone. It's a simple message: Is the right and moral choice really worth it? The story gets very subtle and deeper if you're paying close attention and you'll wind up judging yourself against Ivan and examining who you are as a person.The other acting credits go to voice acting, who also give great performances. And anything with Andrew Scott (Sherlock's Jim Moriarty)is very welcome. Overall it's an excellent film. It goes to show what great direction, screenplay, and acting can do for a film. It's not all about the sets and visual effects; this is literally a film that could stand the test of time.The 7.2 rating (15000 votes) is understandable but please don't let it allow you to miss this film. Some may just find it un-enjoyable since it does take place entirely in a single vehicle.",Locke
190,lwood28,Another Fantastic Performance From Tom Hardy,9,5 August 2014,"*Story: Ivan Locke who is a family man and a construction worker and he is driving to one destination and is calling some people on a Bluetooth that's connected to the car. That's all you need to know about this film.*Review: Now when I heard about this movie I thought this movie was just going to be boring and not interesting because the film takes place in a car and it's Tom Hardy talking on the phone. Man was I wrong. This movie is just amazing. Tom Hardy is just ""Fantastic"" in this film. The Academy needs to give this guy an Best Actor nomination. Now I don't think he'll win but it would be awesome if he got nominated. But it would be better if he won. As the movie progresses you start to find out where Locke is going and why. Also the phone conversations he has with people are entertaining. And when somebody calls you want to know who it is and what they're going to say. When you find out where he's going it didn't seem that interesting to me but it's acceptable. I just wanted it to be intense. The movie is very short it's 1 hour and 25 minutes long. One thing I wished that was better is the ending. Now I'm not saying the ending wasn't terrible but if there was an extra couple minutes that could've been better. One thing I would like to point out is that based on how long the movie is and who the actor or actress is, and who the director is this movie reminds me of Enemy and Under the Skin which I haven't seen yet. Which all movies that surrounds one character who is played by a great actor or actress and the story is about them. And the director is only known from one movie they made. And the movies are short too. So Locke, Enemy, and Under the Skin are like a Twilight Zone episode but it's made into a movie. And I hope more people will make movies like this because these movies have really interesting stories and they seem new and original. Overall Locke is a amazing movie. Tom Hardy did fantastic. The direction of the film and the camera shots in the movie are also fantastic because it all takes place in a car.""I want to know that I'm not driving in one direction."" -Ivan Locke",Locke
191,cristiandeiana,A well written script which delivers on many levels.,8,9 February 2018,"I'll start by stating the obvious, that this is an unusual movie because it's setting is restricted merely to the interior of a car, which could give the impression that it could be quite boring. In actual fact this movie delivers more suspense than many other so called thrillers that I've seen in recent years. It's a testament to the importance of good dialogue, and a well written script which delivers on many levels. I admire the character of Ivan Locke because of how he handles the many situations in the movie, it conveys a strong message in anger management, and morality. When he makes the choice to do the right thing, even though he ends up pushed into a corner he still remains calm and finds the best solution. I think it's a really good message to present in the movie, which is what compelled me to write this review. I will however say that I think the movie rates a bit lower on rewatchability, other than that it was a great watch.",Locke
192,laurasomia,An interesting concept,6,11 September 2019,"This movie, which takes place in its entirety in Ivan Locke's car, is a true acting feat for Tom Hardy.

I did feel like the pace of the movie was too slow to my taste, and struggled to stay focused after a while.",Locke

It is 1 hour and 20 minutes of a guy driving in a car and talking about concrete and calling some woman he had a one night stand with and made a baby with to tell her he's coming to the baby's birth but also doesn't care about the woman.This is literally the worst excuse for a movie I have ever seen and you have to be mad to give it all those positive reviews (they must be joke reviews)Avoid this like a plague.

For everyone else, I strongly suggest that you skip it. This film is about a guy driving in his car talking on his cell phone with various people. That's it! This goes on for about 90 minutes. The scene never changes. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. Maybe a car accident. Maybe he runs out of gas. Maybe he gets pulled over by the cops. Maybe he stops at a convenient store to buy a donut. No, nothing. Nothing happens in this film. All he does is drive and talk on the phone. There is no need to actually ""watch"" this film. You could just listen to it and you wouldn't miss anything because the scene never changes. He's still driving his car. Will he ever reach his destination? Will he ever stop talking?",Locke
195,ginobean,unsympathetic protagonist ruined it for me,2,31 March 2016,"The movie's about a good man who makes a monumentally bad decision that ends up costing him his family and his job.Hardy delivered an excellent performance but that performance was based on a fairly unbelievable script. It's mind boggling and incomprehensible to me that a man would throw away a good job and a good family over a one night stand who he doesn't even have deep feelings for, because he wants to ""do the right thing."" And this failure of the script, to make this fundamental premise believable and in a way that kept the character likable, made the movie a massive fail for me. I kept on thinking to myself what a foolish and stupid man this guy was. And, in the movie, he makes breathtaking decisions that are so outrageously beyond the pale and borderline suicidal that it alienated me from the movie.",Locke
196,audie_u,Wow that was dull,2,9 February 2015,"Locke may be the most boring thing I've ever seen. There isn't a whole lot to say about this film. It's a movie where someone never leaves a car and talks about concrete on the phone. I wanted this to be good, it could have been, but there were no stakes. At least, nothing worth going through the trouble and effort to make a movie about. There are movies with one setting and one person on screen the entire time that are actually good, Locke wasn't one of them.I'll sum up the lesson that can be gleaned from this movie to spare people from watching this monotony: wear a condom.Also, at least the phone calls he has from his car are decently safe since they're hands free.",Locke
197,robbieclaravall,Locke is a minimalist and a powerful one man show.,8,20 May 2016,"Locke has a very unique setting. For one and a half hours, the entire film will be shown in a man's car. It doesn't stray away from that which, at first I doubted since I personally got prejudiced at how I'll enjoy a whole film at a setting like this. In the end I didn't know why I doubted since this is very powerful and it greatly shows how impacting a minimalist film can be. Tom Hardy is the only actor that we can see physically throughout the duration of the film and he absolutely slays his role; although he is only in a car and doesn't have an entire platform in showing off his capability in acting, he still pulls it off through his facial expressions and he really does the best that he could whilst in the car, getting really resourceful in every scene. The idea of a man making calls in his car for the whole film may sound redundant and tiring as you watch it but Hardy brings up something new in each moment with his acting which ultimately captures and captivates the viewer; this film passed by so quickly, I did not feel the time at all.The film also does a great job in presenting the problems to Hardy's character and how he tries his best to deal each one positively. We don't get the problems all at once but gradually in each call he makes; this film doesn't speed things up and duly takes its sweet time in showing off how in a bad situation Ivan Locke (Hardy) really is. There's a bit psychological drama also going and hinted in some calls which is good and makes us know his character more. There was this small subplot revolving around Locke and his father which I wished we got to see a more of since it seemed like they had a bad relationship as father-son and it would be interesting to explore around Locke's character and his parental dynamics; that's really just something minor, nothing that affects the entire film but something I'd just like to point out.Locke keeps things intimate and to a small scale level; it's really powerful and shows a glimmer of hope amidst the depressing reality of today's world. Hardy really brings the show and this film never got boring and dull despite the unique one place setting; the way information is presented in this film slowly is intriguing and the drama is just plain amazing. All in all just something I'd recommend everyone to see; it's better to go in blind without knowing too much so that the viewer will have a shockingly good time discovering things on his/her own.",Locke

199,JoshuaHarryMurphy,An Intimate and Memorable British Film,8,23 July 2014,"Locke is a British drama film written and directed by Steven Knight. The film primarily stars Tom Hardy, with Tom Holland, Olivia Colman, Andrew Scott, Ruth Wilson, Ben Daniels, and Alice Lowe all providing vocal contributions. The filmmaking itself is very audacious. The entirety of the narrative concerns construction foreman Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy) in his car, who has decided to drive from Birmingham to London the day before a massive concrete pour to reach a hospital where a woman is giving birth to his child. Simultaneously Locke attempts to maintain stability whilst receiving calls from his wife, the hospital, his boss, his sons and his assistant. Due to the restricted nature of the film, there's a demand for a strong performance from its lead, which Hardy provides effortlessly. His performance is excellent throughout, and he excels in portraying both blunt rage and subtle interior struggles. The positioning of audiences in the car alongside of him allows for an intimate exploration into one of the most interesting characters we've seen so far this year. The narrative itself is restricted – audiences will learn information at the same pace as Locke, which further cements the character as a relatable and fathomable. The film's soundtrack subtly accompanies events, and it's brooding and suspenseful tone is expertly used to match the tension on screen. The film's greatest achievement however comes from the manner of construction. The replacement of other physical characters in the film with only their voices is a stroke of genius. It intentionally permits continuation of the intimate exploration of Locke's psyche but never hinders the genuineness of the relationships he has. Locke is an outstanding piece of work that also has a long shelf life, as the intimate atmosphere which is constructed is as equally suited to a much smaller screen as it is to a darkened cinema. Steven Knight has succinctly displayed that more often than not less is more. Rarely has such an isolated and inaccessible character been so engaging and accessible.",Locke
200,anteksw,Wasted Potential,6,14 January 2015,"Reading up on the unusual take on a drama led by the talented Tom Hardy prior to watching the actual film got me intrigued and somewhat excited; I love experimental films, I guess you could say I'm a fan of independent cinema and art house style films. Furthermore, the positive reviews helped to remove any sceptical feelings I might have had before going into this film.Unfortunately, 'Locke' was ultimately a disappointment. I didn't expect it to 'drag', but personally, I found the struggles surrounding our dysfunctional protagonist so predictable and at times cliché that the film actually began to drag and towards the end just bored me. There are however aspects of this film that really worked for me, notably Hardy's undying and captivating performance along with a nicely matched soundtrack essentially making this film somewhat enjoyable. Added to this, the limited cinematography was also used to its full effect and was quite visually pleasing. However, as mentioned previously, the film's 'dragging' tone eventually defeated this satisfaction and, as the film progressed, made it seem like the crew was struggling to come up with different angles of Hardy's face. The ending was undoubtedly anticlimactic, I was hoping to at least see a montage of the characters that were plainly developed through phone conversations but the film just introduced another different shot and not much else.In conclusion, I'm giving this film a generous 6/10, I appreciate the concept and its initial potential but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations, I'd suggest giving it a watch if you're interested in seeing Hardy's versatility as an actor. In short, 'Locke' is purely a nicely shot showcase of Tom Hardy's talent coupled with bad writing.",Locke

207,crberme,A simple a movie that delivers a lot,9,23 August 2017,"It can seem that this movie doesn't have much to offer since is a one hour and a half story happening inside a car. The truth is that is far from right.Locke presents it's plot in a way that the viewer can easily empathise: a man, who's been faced with an important decision to make, gets in the car after getting out of work and starts driving to his destination. In the meantime, he makes and receives calls, some of these life-changing.Since is a long ride, we're able to see a roller coaster of feelings, both in the calls and the time where he's alone with his thoughts, as the story slowly unfolds. While this movie has some serious wonderful acting by all the actors and actresses who give voice to the people on the other side of the phone, Tom Hardy makes an excellent job in deliver emotions, and I would say the way he express them is one of the best parts of this movie.This is not a perfect film, whatsoever. After watching it I was left with the feeling that it missed something, like some sort of icing on the cake to make it 10 out of 10. Although this movie is about the progression and not an end product, it left me kind of cold.Locke is probably not for everyone, since it requires you to think and pay attention to really understand what's going on, but if you're willing to make the effort, the experience will definitely be worth it.",Locke

And I loved it being shot in real time.My only complaint is I really wanted to see a hospital sign at the end, or something indicating he made it.",Locke
209,LauraLeeWasHere,Locke: A Meal NOT from Drive-Thru,9,11 June 2015,"CLOSED CAPTIONING is a MUST while watching the film ""Locke"", especially if you are NOT from the UK. My Mom was deaf, so I've used CC in general for years and discovered it helps especially when I'm watching anything with people using accents not the same as my own.Since the dialogue in ""Locke"" is hugely important and there are several different British accents being used, take a moment to flip on the CC. You really don't want to miss anything being said because it is wonderfully written by Steven Knight. It's so true to life that it takes only a few minutes to become thoroughly involved in this man's dilemma. It's been a long time since I've seen a film so true to human nature. There was barely an emotion I didn't experience while watching. I laughed, cried, got angry, anxious, etc. Even everything he says to his father is exactly the same as my own experience that it was almost spooky. Right down to my father reappearing years later wearing ""trainers"". And how Ivan took his last name, ""Locke"" and ""made it right"". I've always felt that I wanted to live a good life to ""fix"" my family name. To make it represent something good and meaningful after generations of it standing for crud.But this film should be watched TWICE to be truly appreciated. The first time for the plot & to focus solely on Tom Hardy (he is definitely a one- man-band). But the second time to focus on and appreciate the SUPPORTING CAST. They do such a remarkable job too that you don't even consider them during the first viewing. All you know is that you are lost in what is going on. That means everyone is doing their ""supporting"" job to such perfection that they ""disappear"" into the experience of the story. Think of it as tasting food. The first mouthful just gets your taste buds ready to become more defining so you can pick up on the smaller nuances. It takes your second bite before you appreciate how good the food really is. It's the same for watching ""Locke"". The first time is about following the plot. The second time you're ready to truly get down to enjoying every other part of the rest of this film.Also, the second time make sure you play close attention to the ""set design"", even though the entire movie takes place in one car for a 90 minute drive. Because there is so little ""set"", nothing is in the car by accident. (For Example: on the Passenger seat you see a layer of those wooden balls that make it more comfortable and aids circulation if a person is taking a long car ride. But how often do you see them on the PASSENGER side of a car? Do TWO people sit in this car for long periods of time? It's important that the ""navigator"" is comfortable. Does that speak to his marriage? Is he considerate or is his wife demanding? A person could discuss the psychology of the ""set design"" for hours.) This film is like a meal. It's got a lot of courses, is prepared well, with care and attention to detail and there is something in it for everyone. So enjoy.

It's quite boring honestly, you keep waiting, expecting for something dramatic to happen. He crashes, or someone robs him, or he's just hid a body and is skipping town now. But no, it's just a man in a car talking on the phone. It's like a proffesionally shot vlog or something. I feel this is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it. I'm one of the few that hated it. I feel like a lot of scenes were just useless and didn't move things a long but at the same time I can't help but feel without them the movie would be a total flop. Its a strange set of emotions I'm feeling here.I would say the camera work and cinematography is astounding but like I said, it's a man in a car on the freeway. It's not much to work with but the movie is as visually pleasing as a car can be.",Locke
211,theicon87,'Locke' takes you on a drive you'll never forget,9,12 July 2014,"If there's one thing that we can trust, it's that Tom Hardy carries motion pictures on his shoulders with incredible ease. After his masterful performance in Bronson, Hardy has been on a tear of good movies, all with memorable performances including Inception,The Dark Knight Rises, and now Locke.In the same fashion as 2002's Phone Booth, the whole film is set in one location and focuses on one man and the situation he's in, how he's reacting, and how he gets out of it. It starts off slow and strong as we follow Ivan (Hardy) as he's in his car driving for what seems to be an eternity. You can instantly see that he's stressed out and that all isn't well. As it progresses, we see Ivan make a ton of phone calls, all of which are about family and his work as a construction manager. We find out that although there's a career making (or breaking) deal going on at his work that he is much needed for, he's leaving it in the hands of less capable people, because he's on his way to witness the birth of his son. Ivan calls his wife, Katrina (Ruth Wilson) and explains to her that he won't be home for a while because of his son's birth. He goes on to explain that he had an affair with a co-worker named Bethan (Olivia Colman) several months ago. He tells Katrina that he was going to tell her about it once he got the courage, but he hadn't expected Bethan to go into premature labor. With calls from Bethan and nurses at the hospital coming in, hateful calls from his workplace, and dreaded conversation with his now upset and betrayed wife, we watch as Locke tries to fit all the pieces into play and make everything work out, despite how overwhelmed he is. There's a bit of a breakdown scene by Hardy earlier on, but he's surprisingly relaxed the rest of the film, even though he's under incredible pressure. What his performance needed was a major breakdown scene. If there were some crying and real anger and aggression, this would have been his best performance. With nothing going his way, and things seemingly getting worse at work and home, it appears as though the birth of his new son is the best news in his life. Although his wife tells him never to come home again, the light at the end of the tunnel is the news that his son was born safely. After finding out that Ivan was abandoned by his real father as a child, we see why it's so important for Ivan to take a part of his child's life. He didn't meet his real father until his early twenties, and doesn't want the same life for his newborn. In the end, although it was an affair the child is born from, to me, the purpose of the story was to show how important human life is and that no matter what the circumstances of a birth are, children and life are a blessing and better than any bad news that can come at you. It's a touching and gripping story that's beautifully played out and acted. It's only about an hour and 25 minutes, so it's an easy watch. When I viewed it, you could hear a pin drop due to how compelled I was. It's very intense, and character-based.Locke is a true gem of modern cinema. It's a hell of a lot better than the aforementioned Phone Booth, and it's an immediate Blu-ray purchase for me. Hardy keeps your eyes glued to the screen, and the story keeps you on your toes. It's an all-around very well done achievement. I loved it!",Locke
212,michaelsharples96,Locke is a brilliant piece of independent cinema,8,28 July 2014,"Tom Hardy is fantastic in this one man show, the best man for the job. He catches the emotion of the character perfectly with both the conversations on phone and dealing with his own devils. Even tho he's the only person on screen, with the phone calls you really feel that they are in car with him, in the middle of all the suspense. Tom really makes you feels sorry for his character and makes you start to sympathise with what he is dealing with. The things he endures would make most men crumble yet he manages to pull through. With an emerging crises at work and his domestic problems at home being completely in the balance. After each phone call growing in suspense Hardy reciprocates with the anger and frustration of what he is dealing with very well. He feels his while world crumbling around him Towards the end you get the feeling that things are getting better, but are they?. Well I'll just let you find out. If you're looking for an all out suspense you are in the wrong place and you're probably not going to like it. But if you can find greatness in an amazing plot then it's the movie for you. Locke is filled with all the plot devices that you expect all great stories to have. There's similes and metaphors to all great aspects of life.

How entertaining can it be to watch someone drive in a car for two hours and listen to their cell phone conversations.Yes the fellow had an affair, yes the woman got pregnant, and of course she's goes into pre-mature labor.Now to add further insult to his injury, he tells his wife, on the cell phone of course. He's got a bug day on the construction site, which he's going to blow off and tells his boss, you guessed, on the cell phone.Not a well developed or likable character! Shallow as a tea cup! Maybe this guy should have stuck to the cell phone when he had his affair! ANYWAY, a VERY sssslllooowww movie. Don't waste you time, unless you're a glutton for punishment!",Locke
219,marno76,Amazing (but not for the reason you might think),9,19 May 2014,"This movie is by far the best I have seen in this season. As we all know, due to the trailer and the comments we read on the papers and internet, Ivan Locke has a problem to solve and he must solve it by phone during one driving night. Yet we don't know what this ""problem"" is. Usually ""thrillers"" emphasize on difficult task imposed on the main character but here the first surprise is that his task his being more human than human: it is to hold on to what he cares most while at the same tame taking responsibility for what an act he has done. In my opinion, in getting us to know this man, the movie creates a fantastic character: Ivan Locke is a human hero, struggling to keep his life and his loved ones together willing to sacrifice also success, money and a job he loves for this. Because what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Thanks for reminding us how real men should live: responsibly.",Locke
220,enigmaticsince87,Tom Hardy drives on the motorway and it's spellbinding.,9,9 August 2016,"Tom Hardy plays Ivan Locke in this one-person drama from writer-director Steven Knight (Eastern Promises). Locke is a dedicated, successful contractor, leaving a site one evening in his 5-series BMW. We are now with Locke, in his car, for the duration of the film, and all the drama – and believe me, there's a lot of it – comes from the phone calls he has on his enigmatic journey.Much like Phone Booth, it's a hard sell when describing it, but just like Phone Booth, the one-man thriller can work miracles if don't right. Not only is it done right here – Hardy crushes it, with the most powerfully subdued performance.It's torturous and mesmeric, watching Locke's life fall apart over a series of phone calls that, despite being quick and beautifully constructed to develop characters and heighten the drama, feel totally believable and compelling. It's a perfect marriage of great writing and acting, with Hardy demanding your attention, as he does in every role he brings to life, despite simply sitting behind the wheel of a car, on an English motorway, at night.I'm confused as to why Hardy adopts a Welsh accent for this part – perhaps Knight felt it makes him more endearing, I don't know – but other than that, this was a wonderful study in drama and writing, as well as just a tense, enthralling film.",Locke
221,matthewchermside,"Contrived, but Very Emotional",9,19 July 2014,"With so many films being big-budget but ultimately derivative and aimless cash-ins, this film is a bare-bones, back-to-basics character examination.Tom Hardy is incredible in this role, a role which could only have been performed by a few actors. Perhaps Russell Crowe might have done as well but few others would have achieved with this source material.A road trip, many phone conversations, a journey from dark to light, an examination of a person and his history, his emotions, his situation, his future, his essence really.This film achieves what few films do these days - you become engaged with a character and want to see how the story pans out. Just one character. A human who makes mistakes but who still, even when he is struggling to stay afloat, has the temerity and personality to be a force for good in a bad situation.This film makes you form an opinion of the character and through his journey, offers you enough evidence to challenge that opinion. It's well written, incredibly well scripted, well photographed and executed.",Locke
222,rollstop,Intriguing to watch if you are in the right mood.,5,18 September 2014,"Movies clearly have more of an impact on someone depending on their setting while viewing it i.e. at home or at the theater (where one might have just spent $15 on one ticket), their current mood while watching it, how old they are and the experiences in life they themselves have had. I watched this on a whim while at home by myself in a chilled out mood.I'm not sure that many of the people rating this movie a ""10"" truly understand what a 10 means. It should mean that this is one of the greatest cinematic features you will have ever seen in your life. It should be a film that will be remembered a long time from now for various reasons and one that you would recommend to everyone.This movie is not a 10. It should not really be categorized as suspense or thriller or a drama because, as many reviewers have stated, it is just a guy in his car on the phone for the entirety of the movie. I think the word it should be described with is ""intrigue."" Though he is just driving and talking on the phone I found myself wanting to keep watching merely because I was intrigued at how he was going to solve his problems and I liked Tom Hardy's calm demeanor.One aspect that seemed almost far-fetched was that he would go to the aid of a woman he had one fling with seven months ago to be there for their unborn child while risking losing his job during one of its most historic and important contracts as well as fracturing his relationship with his family. And how does he know for 100% certainty that it really is his child? It is not born yet to perform a paternity test and how could he seriously know that she is not just a loose woman playing the field? Why should he trust this practical stranger? Because she told him that she does not sleep around? Also why does she have his phone number? He will not tell her he loves her, he tells his wife it was just that one time, so we know that they have not been having a phone affair. He acts distant on the phone to this woman, Bethan, so his only reason for going to her is because of this baby that he believes is his, not really for her. The only part that makes this scenario somewhat believable (and why the writer had to add this component) is his psychological contention with his late erstwhile father. Apparently he felt abandoned by his father as a child and thus feels some extreme moral obligation to be there as his child is born, which could not wait till the next day after his important concrete pour was finished.There are a lot of correlations between Locke's personal life and the concrete that he works with daily. Especially when he tells Donal, ""You make one mistake, Donal, one little (expletive) mistake, and the whole world comes crashing down around you."" This may be the main message that the writer and movie are trying to get the viewer to really ponder. Just as the foundation of a building is the most important piece and if the concrete is not mixed right or is inferior that cause cracks to appear then the whole building is in jeopardy of being damaged or worst case scenario, collapsing. Likewise in a person's life the foundation in a person's relationship with another is paramount and making wrong choices can damage that relationship(s).I think had I watched this back when I was 18 years old I would have given this a rating of 1 and would have been upset that I wasted my time. I give it a 5 because I did not hate it nor did I really like it, but indifferent. It had some interesting elements to which an average person could relate. But I also think someone who has dealt with serious issues in their life and has had various experiences may relate more to this movie than someone young, inexperienced, and no real clue to why this movie was made.Tom Hardy is becoming a favorite actor of mine and is really the main reason I even decided to watch this movie. He does a good job of carrying the film in spite of its limited setting. The voice acting of the other characters were done well and believable especially from Andrew Scott (Donal), which you may remember him from ""Sherlock"" as Moriarty. The night driving scenes were actually soothing to me and filmed with good quality.Overall I think the story is experimental, try to get the viewer to think, and for novelty.",Locke

226,bRAdY-01,Locke a cinematic tour de force,10,19 October 2013,"Viewed at the Leicester Square on the 19th Oct 2013 as part of the London Film Festival. A great film that was completely faultless in in every aspect, even more truly remarkable considering the tiny amount of time that the cast and crew had to make it, nothing less than an astounding for it's superb production management and producing brio. Steven Knight screenplay and direction were masterly by design and sensational in execution. After the screening an audience member in the Q&A referred to the film as relentless, an apt adjective the films roller coaster script was completely reverting as the juxtaposed character interactions went from making you laugh out loud to bringing a tear of compassion to your eye, beautifully written and performed by an ensemble cast all turning in unforgettable performances. Tom Hardy as Ivan Locke, was profoundly captivating turning in a moving performance I believe was a triumphant personal best, with notable memorable contribution from Andrew Scott as Donal and Olivia Colman as Bethan being stand out amongst the all magnificent supporting cast. I was proud to attend the UK Premier of what will surely become shortly recognised as a seminal British feature film, there are so many films made nowadays but very little cinema, add this to the cannon of cinemas masterpieces, a remarkable achievement, story telling and performance at the very highest level and hugely entertaining. Collaboratively nothing less than a cinematic tour de force (by definition a: feat demonstrating brilliance or mastery in a field).",Locke

I feel Locke falls into this category. The film starts with Ivan Locke, a career construction manager and family man, driving south from Birmingham to London, and the camera never leaves the car or the motorway for the entire 85min which are played out more or less in realtime. Battening with his conscience as he tries to coordinate work obligations, issues with his spouse, his children and a significant other, swapping calls from one to the other with high frequency. The camera lingers on different views of Tom Hardy, the blank night road, blurry headlights, but never leaves the environment of the cold night road. It is surprising how a film that could easily work as a radio play, holds your attention with some beautiful shots, but I feel none of the stories are concluded. Tom Hardy's performance is solid, but the voice actors on the phone can be a bit melodramatic at times. In the end, I feel they spoke a lot but didn't say anything.",Locke

In fact, that's what I thought!Well, it's not. It was probably a one-act play. I don't want to give anything away, but the entire film centers on the rock-solid acting of Tom Hardy and a small supporting cast. It's a superb film on every level.

231,jkikianis,Successful Experiment in Limited Storytelling,8,18 December 2015,"This movie continues to hold up as a great experiment in story within a controlled environment. The entire film occurs inside of a car with the various phone calls and monologues made by our lead character Ivan Locke acting as the drama of the narrative arc. This film is dependent on the strength of the leading performer and Tom Hardy carries this film with a powerful performance. The movie acts as a character study of this man as he is within transit of one of the hugest transformations of his life. Hardy gives this character a depth and complexity through the wide range of emotions that he can subtly express through his voice and face. The odd accent that Hardy is sporting for the duration of the film is sometimes distracting and odd but still takes very little away from the ambitious career move made by Hardy. In many ways this is a story of a man fighting against the wrong doings of his own and his family's past. This film would fail without not only the strong lead performance but also a wonderful screenplay that at times is very natural and authentic but at other times suffers from being very clichéd and cheesy. The showcase of this film is not in the sum of it's technical accomplishments but in the complexity of the story and characters within the limited style of filmmaking. Director, Steven Knight, does a great job with keeping the visual style of the film as interesting as possible through capturing a wide array of different shots within this controlled environment. The voice performances from all the secondary characters are also amazing with a specific personality and voice recognition given to each specific character. By the end of the film I felt that I knew Ivan Locke, I understood his perspective and had grown respect for his decision making throughout the film. This film shows a great character study in a way that no other movie ever has and for that reason alone I would definitely recommend this movie.",Locke

It was just a one man show. So many praises has been written that can't find words. One thing though I want to add is, that this movie wants you to celebrate is the gifts of capitalism and modern age. Just watch the whole movie and you'll see the endless lines of vehicle's with speed limit and endless roads all pointing to the achievements done in this age. We can see that just after seventy years after the great war, England has developed as a modern nation with so long roads that it doesn't end even driving all night. Of course most western movies celebrate capitalism, but not in subtle way as this movie. Just look at the roads, the car he is using and the concrete he is referring about.

233,hepodcast,The Most Interesting Story About Concrete Ever,8,9 July 2015,"This is the age of the blockbusters. Huge bombastic films with expensive effects and elaborate set pieces where the fate of the world is in peril from the forces of evil, and only a small band of heroes can save us from certain doom.These are tales with global scale and universal peril. The terrorists must not get the nukes. The super villain must not open the wormhole. The mad scientist must not complete his Super Death Ray.These are not easy stories to tell. All of the pieces must fit together, the effects must be seamless, the cinematography dynamic. Hundreds, sometimes thousands of people work together, and many millions of dollars are spent to create a single work of art. And still the result can be a flawed and disjointed mess.But what happens when you take all of that away? What happens when you throw out the beautiful sets, do away with the special effects, and fire your superheroes?What you have left is a movie like Locke. One man, in one location, dealing with a crisis so personal that the motorists he passes on the freeway as he drives couldn't care less whether he succeeds or fails.And telling that kind of story is harder still.Here, there is no spectacle to distract us, no fight scene for us to cheer for; all we have left is drama.""Drama"" is a word that's been simplified and bastardized to merely mean ""exciting"", but there is so much more to it than that. Drama is that chemical reaction that happens in a story when when a character's greatest inner strength is drawn into conflict.That scene in the last season of Breaking Bad when Walt and Hank finally faced off in Hank's garage? That was drama. No one was shot. No dinosaurs ate anyone. Cthulhu did not awake from his slumber. Instead it was about one man's purpose being stymied by another. Hank's indomitable will to bring his brother-in-law to justice coming into conflict with Walt's threat to bring him down with him if he falls.If the character's principles are weak, or if the conflict does not clash with those principles convincingly, the drama is lost.Locke may be the most dramatic film I've ever seen. The titular character is unbending in his principles, determined to live up to the ideal he has made for himself.And as the story progresses, the challenges his he faces to keep that ideal intact grow exponentially. First his livelihood, then his family, and finally the work that he loves are all brought into peril by his decision to do what he believes is right and honorable, to right the wrongs he has done, to be the man that his father never was.Ivan Locke is a bird in a hurricane, first buffeted, then grounded, but never deterred from his course by one inch.This is Tom Hardy at his finest, not strutting about as a super villain or raging through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, but breathing life into one extraordinary character.Locke isn't just determined. He's broken. He's spent his life resenting his father, building a shell of principles around himself in order to avoid being like the man that failed him. He is honest, literally to a fault, unwilling to bend the truth even to comfort the terrified mother of his bastard child as she goes into early labor.And yet, in spite of these things, he is loved by his family and respected by his peers. This is a man they have all come to rely on. And when his world begins to fall apart, their worlds threaten to crumble along with it.Doubtless this film is not for everyone. It is not particularly ""fun""; it is even possible that some will find Ivan Locke's actions and attitudes to be morally reprehensible. And maybe they aren't wrong to think so.But for my part this is a beautiful portrait of humanity, tragically flawed, yet incredibly strong, facing off against the everyday terrors of life.This is a story about something more important than the fate of the world; it is story about the fate of one man's soul.Find more of our reviews at HumanEchoes.com",Locke

This movie is a very pleasant change and I enjoyed it very much. Tom Hardy was good (not excellent as everyone has been suggesting). The story is very simple and to the point. The thing that I enjoyed a lot was the frequency of the film and the way they fluctuate between highly intensity to a bit calm and then back again. The camera work very good. That all being said I still think there is something missing here. I cant find any major flaws in the film, its in the premise of being a highly rated film but something is little bit off. And after thinking a lot I think Tom hardy was trying very hard to keep the calm, cool and the lovable being and he never let go of himself in the character. I think that was the only thing that stopped this movie to be the ultimate thriller drama that it could have been. And it had all the ingredients to be one of the best movie this year.

That needs a great script and a great actor. This is my type of film and I loved it.Unfortunately the film suffers from an extremely poor attempt by Tom Hardy to speak English with a Welsh accent. Someone should have given Tom some language tuition. This is an unfortunate consequence of being low budget.Putting the accent to one side, the film was great in every other respect and I loved the script, acting and photography.

242,michael_balsdon,One Man. In a Car. A Different Type of Film.,8,21 March 2018,For me this film is one of the major tests to see whether you are a true Tom Hardy fan. Hardy offers one of the best performances of his career in this film despite the fact that he plays a man that is simply driving his car and making and receiving phone calls. The film relies on Hardy's ability to carry the movie through its 85 minute run time and he succeeds. He perfectly captures the internal struggle of a man trying to make amends for a problem he caused. The supporting cast despite being voice roles are also good. The phone calls which are at the heart of the films plot feel real and there is never a point where you think that these are being acted.The only gripe with this film is that it's simplistic plot layout of Locke going from one phone conversation to the other can feel tedious to some viewers and the films ending while a suitable conclusion for the plot can leave people wanting more of a resolution to Locke's story.,Locke

As he takes to the road he is seemingly a man in control of his destiny, determined to do the right thing only for everything to slowly unravel. Through conversations on the phone he tries to negotiate an emerging crisis at work with his boss and an evolving domestic situation with a concerned wife and sons desperate to have their dad home to watch the football.With a premise of just one actor in a confined location it is testament to Hardy's acting nous that he can pull off such a taught, powerful performance solely based on reactions to the increasingly dramatic phone calls. Locke is unrelenting in his belief of doing the right thing and we see why when he has imagined conversations with his father, an apparently neglectful and emotionally absent figure in his life. These scenes in particular are beautifully shot with the use of Locke looking into the car mirrors for the man who isn't there.It wastes very little of its short running time and overall is a captivating and rewarding film with a terrific central performance.",Locke
250,treanewsome,"A Man, A Car, A cell, A Complicated Life",1,22 August 2014,"This movie is about A man, a car,a cell phone and a complicated life. This was bloody awful and as dull as they come. the whole scene is in the car and no scenery. It's like being on a stakeout I imagine for days. I struggled to watch this film. Much wasted film for this movie. Anyone wanting a drama could find much better. it seemed too shallow despite the forced deep messages. I can't recommend this to anyone. I wonder if this was a straight to disc release? I can't see paying $12 for this in theater. Maybe the director and cast will learn from this. Maybe choose a different path next time. Could they not afford the budget for a whole movie?",Locke
251,flashgordonemail,a little over rated.,6,23 August 2014,"not as brilliant as the critics might suggest. it was a good performance by hardy, but it had to be, because he was the only face we see for the duration of the film. in that singular sense, its an interesting study on the isolation one man feels when put in the situation which he has to control and make right when things are largely out of control and he is facing a personal crisis. when its all upon this one man to work everything out. the backdrop and scenery to this movie is a motorway to London that hardy is driving on, the direction is pleasant enough, as night lights elegantly fade from scene to scene, it carries the film well enough working within the minimal constraints. the idea of a the set of this film being simply a car upon a motorway, kind of brings the movie down to a level of humble familiarity, a drive that many of us make. the story doesn't seem too far fetched either which increases the chances the audience being able to empathise or even relate. my main complaint though was how this film would be categorised. many might say its a drama, but if it is a drama then it significantly lacks drama! it's certainly not a thriller as some have classified it. it's definitely not a bad film, but it is by no means amazing. a significantly middle of the road affair, if you'll excuse the pun. with a few plus points to its credit.",Locke
252,Alexagrrr,Irritating on so many levels,1,26 August 2014,"I was eager to watch this film after seeing it described as a thriller. I appreciated the idea that the film was set entirely in a car and the action unfolded in real time, and I was interested to see Tom Hardy in this challenging role.In fact, there's nothing thrilling about this film, and I found myself irked by almost everything in the plot - a man gives up everything to do the right thing - because in the end he didn't need to do any of it.Here's the set-up (spoiler!): Locke knocked up a coworker during a drunken one-night stand some seven months before. On the night before a major job, an evening in which he is expected home to watch a football match with his wife and sons, she goes into premature labor and he decides he must drive to London to be with her during the delivery. He mentions, during phone conversations with the aforementioned mother-to-be, that he is about 90 minutes away. (The length of the movie!)He calls his family to tell them he won't be coming home, and they are waiting for the football match to start. He has presumably had months to tell his wife of the situation, but he waits and tells her on the phone and she tells him not to come back, ever. He calls his boss to tell him he won't make it to work the next morning for the most major project of his career, and gets fired.Why is he so determined to Do The Right Thing at such a cost? Because he is a Better Man than his loser father, a fact we learn as he talks to himself in the rear view mirror. This contrivance doesn't work well but has to be used since he can't have a telephone conversation with his dead dad. They could have worked this out by having this conversation with, say, his wife, but never mind.And now, the best part: After all this, he doesn't even make it to the hospital in time because they have to do an emergency C-section, so the baby is heard crying on the phone as he's nearing the hospital.What I really couldn't figure out was the time line. It's dark out, but he just left work, the football match is just starting, so figure it's 8:00 in the evening or so. Later he talks to someone who is at a restaurant, again fixing the time as evening. He's got to be back at work at 5:30 a.m., in, say, nine hours. If he's only 90 minutes away from London, he should be able to get there AND BACK in ample time for this job.Then there's Hardy's decision to speak with this odd, overly-calm, stilted cadence, which I later discovered was supposed to be a Welsh accent. Why? He's not coming from Wales (two and a half hours from London), no one else in the movie is Welsh; it's a non-sequitur. And the phone is ringing constantly, which of course it would be, I guess, but that just made the film that much more irritating.Maybe the new mother appreciates all he has sacrificed just to be with her, even though he repeatedly tells her he doesn't love her, doesn't even know her, and doesn't apparently want much else to do with her. I bet she'd rather just have child support.All in all, I can't think of a movie I've hated more.",Locke

That's the whole story and it's super boring.The visuals are really nice but after 10 minutes you start getting bored of them since nothing is going on and that's what we see throughout. There are other movies with less visuals that manage to keep the story much more interesting regardless if it's in a car or a room throughout the movie. A fine example is The Man From Earth.Acting-wise, there is only one character and he is superb with what he was given. However it makes little sense why such a stressed man keeps making 1000 phone calls under 1hr. Totally unrealistic and starts getting annoying very fast.I advice to not spend a dime to watch this.

255,abigailjackson-55395,interesting film making but definitely not for everyone,7,28 October 2020,"To be completely honest, I knew nothing about the movie at all, other than that Tom Hardy was in it, before watching it. After the first fifteen minutes, I was beginning to wonder how much longer until he reaches the hospital? After scrubbing through the rest of the movie, I realized that the entire plot of the movie centers around the phone calls he receives on his way to the hospital. At first, I was a little upset by this, but I came to really enjoy it. The film finds a way to be engaging without much visual storytelling which I found very bold and unique. The film would have been an utter failure without an actor of Tom Hardy's caliber. He does a great job of engaging the audience with little to work with other than limited body language and his own voice. I'm not going to lie, parts of the movie were a little dull, but the uniqueness of the storyline made up for it in my opinion. This movie is definitely not for everyone, but it's a must watch if you want to look into to different types of fil making and story telling. I'm pretty unlikely to re-watch this movie any time soon, but in the end it's a worthwhile watch.",Locke

I didn't absolutely have to break it half way through, but I'd had enough, and I didn't find it un-put-down-able. Watching Tom Hardy for upwards of an hour and a half, and only Tom Hardy, playing a somewhat buttoned up, very intelligent and very good at his job character, was easy, that wasn't the problem. I even found the story believable, just about. Suspension of disbelief and all that kicked in. What I did find troubling was that such a perfectionist, to the point of obsessionality, should have been so reckless, first, and second, should have surrounded himself with such a bunch of hysterics. His wife, the mother, and his subordinate Donal. All absolutely hysterical. Good actors. But the script, here, left something to be desired - in fact I found some of their input so tediously silly and grating I fast forwarded. So I will never need to watch this flawed movie again.

I was skeptical because I am a lover of entertaining movies and this one takes place only in a car. It was a challenge for me to watch the movie.So, is it a good movie ?It is more than that. It is a demonstration of cinema. Steven Knight shows us that a movie do not need explosions or many special effects to be great. You just need a camera, a place, a good script and Tom Hardy.Tom Hardy is amazing in this movie, he does a perfect interpretation of his character. He shows that he can play every role because play so well just by driving a car is incredible.OK, I confess, this is not the kind of movie that I would watch a hundred times.

For the whole film there is one visible character and everybody else interacting with him only via a hands-free kit. To think that a film made on this premise would be utterly riveting and absorbing, nail-biting, raw and emotional is ludicrous. Yet this film delivers completely on what it promises. This has to do with great cinematography and phenomenal actors - Tom Hardy and Olivia Coleman. This film had a very small budget and was shot in long sequences over eight days. This is a testament to the professionalism of the cast and crew and the raw talent of Tom Hardy, that this film could be so amazing. Not only is Tom lovely to look at, and he does a mean Welsh accent, he is really one of the most amazing actors to come from Britain - EVER!

I caught myself doing other stuff, while the film went on, and I don't normally do that. I guess it's the setting. For more that an hour, we are confined in one vehicle - this is where everything happens. It's a bit boring, and the director couldn't or wouldn't find a way to enrich the scene more, as if the intention was for the viewer to concentrate on the dialogues only. But for a lot of instances, the conversations are boring. We don't have beautiful scenery to feast upon. We get to know Locke's qualities through conversations as good worker and responsible person, a lot more than we need to. The reason for me then, to write this review was the need to say that for everyone who had the experience to be or witness intimately the presence of the child like Locke was or fathered, then this movie hits a spot. But then, it is decided for most of the movie's duration what the verdict of the main protagonist's actions is, and we are not in suspense what he will do (the green color of the traffic light in the beginning of the movie, which is the same color of the shirt Locke's father wore - the trigger of everything), we already know, so I expected a journey with doubts and self examinations, a real journey to one's self.",Locke

He basically said he had sex with her because he felt sorry for her. Then when they find out the cord is wrapped around the baby's neck and they need to do a c-section, Bethan tells him that the doctors think she's ""too old to push."" What the hell? Women in their 40s give birth vaginally all the time. It was her baby's condition, not her age, that caused a problem. Ivan also makes a comment about her being old and lonely and this baby being her last chance at happiness. Between this man talking to his wife about how he only cheated one time (as if that makes it ok), and then describing the cheating as if his penis was just providing charity for the lonely, decrepit 43 year old woman, this movie came across as little more than a bit of misogynistic rubbish.",Locke

The movie, Locke, is almost completely comprised of shots of Tom Hardys character as he leaves the construction site that his character was overseeing for the largest concrete pour for a building anywhere in Europe, as he drives to be at the birth of a child whose conception was accidental (and done during a moment of kindness by Tom's character with a lonely female who he worked with on a previous building project).Tom Hardys command of the Welsh building supervisor that he inhabits is flawless and shows an emotional intelligent and intuition that very few actors that I have seen come close to - that of a real character who, slowly but surely, totally engages the emotions of the audience to the point that you don't even realise you have been watching an actor behind the wheel of a car as his character drives through an English night to support a woman he hardly knows and who is otherwise totally alone.

This a film with one actor one car and one mobile phone and yet is so full of emotions, extreme situations and difficult decisions. The triumph of this movie lies in the fact that in an era of huge stress and tension in all aspects of everyday life, be it personal, professional, social, Locke stands as a genuine hero. I know that the analogy may be a bit over the top but lets face it, Locke deals with all those that common people avoid, confronts events of immeasurable consequences and doesn't hide them under the carpet as me or you would. No, not tonight for him, he takes matters in his own hands and goes on a personal crusade to right all those wrongs himself let evolve and haunt him. And all that through a cellphone. His car, often a chariot of freedom in road movies, here serves as a claustrophobic cell ridden with personal demons and at the same time as a shelter because by his own admission - this is all he has.Obviously a very special mention belongs to Tom Hardy for landing a career defining performance. I felt for him the way I would feel for a close friend, because even if he is the architect of his misfortune he has the integrity and courage to deal with it like a man, and I don't say that lightly.

As we expect, things go south, still it's interesting and compelling through out the run time of 100 minutes. Surprisingly this movie in every single scene happening within a contained environment and yet I was totally invested in Ivan Locke( Tom Hardy) and cared for the emotions of the characters over the phone .A big round of applause to the Writer/Director Steven Knight for delivering such emotional drama/thriller only by showcasing ONE character. Tom Hardy hits home-run in delivering the compelling performance on every single turns and flows Ivan Locke went through in the script which exceptional from an action hero. One of the biggest strengths to this movie was the BGM score from the first shot to till last shot BGM keeps us with Ivan Locke as he takes time to think, moan, cry or out burst we feel it from inside with the character. The only issue would be movie takes its time to grab our attention i:e: I was bit looking at the phone and assumed its going to bore me but once movie seize your attention we get lost into it for next 60+ minutes. This movie reminded me of ""Buried"" starring Ryan Reynolds within the same genre but for me it was better movie. Kudos to the team for delivering such engaging movie with a simpler plot line which will take two or three days to digest the impact it made within us.

If Tom Hardy wasn't in this, no-one would have wished to see it or maybe you wouldn't have seeked it out. Your expectations would be fairly low and you'd be willing to appreciate the honesty of the story and it's simplistic, no-fuss delivery.But because he was, you're more likely to pick out flaws and as you'd have higher expectations they'd annoy you.The story was called 'Locke' thus drawing attention to Hardy's presence yet the story was primary here with several key supporting characters required to tell it. This supporting voice-only cast were weak with the exception of Alice Lowe who managed to scrape through. Hardy, and the story itself should've been complimented with a more suitable choice of interlocutors who's presence could be better felt though voice work alone; though this may have made the film bigger than the story.Alternatively, and the way to go in my humble estimation, would have been to use a lead with less stature, and allow the story to reach us by means other than a 'well-known' on the cover.",Locke
280,GojuRyu5,Refreshingly different,8,1 August 2020,"I get sick of reading 1 star reviews on IMDB from people with no imagination, who all seem to expect stunning visuals, action and Williams-esque scores. But every now and then, along comes a film that tells a story which you can relate to, where you can really understand the pain of the main characters, and which doesn't follow the standard formula. That is Locke.
This is the story of a man that usually plays straight down the line and is now trying to make right a mistake - taking big decisions to do the right thing and Hardy plays it brilliantly. The essential calmness of his motorway journey and yet raw emotion bubbling under the surface are palpable, in stark contrast to the background of a whole film shot in the confines of his car. A great idea - the viewer can only concentrate on the dialogue and imagine the seismic implosion of everything the main character held so dear up to that point.

Yes, sorry, there is not one explosion. There are no fight scenes... not even a car chase (despite being set entirely in a car). The wife is a not a model. Nor is the 'girlfriend'. Of course, it's hard to tell, as we don't see either. But...This is a film about real life. It has real people. That's what makes it interesting. It has great acting, and it draws you in to a story that does not depend on whether someone is murdered or blown up. The makers of this film have taught us that it is possible to make a film on a shoestring budget that would fund 30 seconds of the latest Hollywood 'blockbuster'. Let's hope a few in the industry are brave enough to take note and for once abandon the tired old formula that is responsible for so much dross that pours out of American studios. I'm not saying all U.S. films are terrible. Of course not. They produce some excellent ones, and have some superb actors. It is just that so many of their efforts are so similar and so predictable, with the same old tired ingredients. This film shows that it is possible to junk those and produce a riveting view with next to no budget.",Locke
282,Geek_Kinks,Pretty Good Considering the Circumstances,7,13 January 2015,"I had to rate this movie a 7 simply because Tom Hardy's range is impeccable. He made the movie watchable. However, it was slowwwwwww, not that I am complaining. It's more of an artsy fartsy type of piece, very focused on acting ability and story/plot alone. In my opinion its not about scenes, or camera angles....just simply one man and his story. I did enjoy it, but it isn't something I could watch again and again. This is not the movie to watch if you're looking for thrills, or chills; but if you're a movie buff, or looking to just sit back and relax....but not if you're sleepy! lol I think Tom Hardy's acting keeps you pulled in, wondering, ""what will happen next?""

Most people praise Hardy's performance, which is undoubtedly brilliant, however I would also like to point out that the supporting cast also did an excellent job in keeping us engaged with the protagonist's gradually unfolding drama. Quite of an accomplished, considered that those actors rely only on their voice (transmitted by phone, that is)and not facial expressions or body language to get across their message. At times it felt as if they were actually on screen. I only have to complain about the somewhat cheesy finale and admit that I am not truly convinced that anything like that would happen in real life, I think most people would try to find a middle ground between the two choices, but then again, most people's stories don't make it into a movie.

Tom Hardy holds it all together as the lead character but for me the story and the way it's presented is the high point of the film. I learned more about concrete than I ever needed to know, but as I said earlier it is precisely this attention to detail that makes the other elements of the story so believable.

When I first saw the trailer for Locke a few months ago, I had shivers down my spine.There was a New York Film Critics screening right near where I go to school, and knowing that it would be the only time I'd get to see it, I decided to check it out this evening, even paying 18 bucks.If you've heard of this movie then you know that it is described as a man driving a car for an hour and 20 minutes, trying to right something that he has done wrong. This much is true. That being said, I was not bored for a single moment. Tom Hardy gave one of the best performances I've seen in a while, so realistic that you would think the character Ivan Locke is a real human being.Though the premise and Ivan's situation were not what I expected, I was glued to the screen the entire time. I walked away from the film wanting more, but the more and more I think about it the more I realize this movie truly is masterclass filmmaking. Throughout the course of the film you feel like you're connected to Ivan Locke. I was biting my nails to such a simple premise, and this happens to me rarely, tears were brought to my eyes at a couple points in the film. Obviously this is due to the way Tom Hardy carries this movie on his shoulders and establishes a connection with all audience members. Not to mention Steven Knight's expert directing and camera angles.

The movie seems boring from a simple summary. ""It's about a guy taking phone calls in his car for almost 90 minutes"". That sounds boring, but it's not. It's actually the most suspenseful movie of the year. (2014, it came out in the US in 2014). Sounds impossible, but writer/director Steven Knight does amazing with a tiny budget. You also get to know, not only Hardy's character, but the people he's talking to on the phone as well. They truly seem like real people. The situation they create is also very creative and interesting. I won't say what it is, but I don't think it's a spoiler. I'll just say it makes you wonder what you'd do in the given situation.

When an indispensable construction manager goes AWOL on the night of the critical concrete pour of the foundation of a world renowned building project to support an ""acquaintance"" in the hospital he must manage his drunk and incompetent understudy, deal with his family over the potential loss of career all while making the two hour night time drive from the job site to the hospital in London.

But it can. And it does. Locke, played brilliantly by Tom Hardy, is a Welsh man who works as a manager of some sort on a building site - after work one night, he climbs into his car and drives south, heading for London. Along the way, he makes and receives a number of phone-calls that turn his life 'upside-down'. Everything from personal and relationship issues, to work issues. The action never moves from the car. In honesty, the issues he deals with are important in HIS world, but there isn't a shock or a twist ending. They are his issues and we take a moment in his life and live it through him.

Single actor in this movie is enough to make you feel comfortable for 84 minutes.I'm imagining Locke's ride on the highway as life, because life is crazy drive of both bad and good decisions, of which it depends on how fast we will drive and when we will turn right from that highway. This movie shows us great internal conflict of person who drives, professionalism and privacy,
emotions and power, family and job.The only movie that I watched and it' similar to this one, is Phone Booth with Colin Farrell.The difference is that Ivan Locke is not in death danger and we don't feel fear, if he is gonna die or not.And I like that.Life is not Hollywood.I always respect scenes in movies which shows us real-life scenes.

' Buried ', ' 127 hours ', ' All is lost ',
' Cast away ', ' The shallows '....... and many more.All of the aforementioned movies are good, but my recently-watched movie "" Locke "" stands out from the rest. The movie is about a construction manager who's very good at managing things,finds his life descending into Chaos when he gets to know that the girl he once had an one-night stand with is about to give birth to his child.Tom Hardy is terrific in this movie. You just can't take your eyes off him. He completely transfixes you with his poignantly enthralling performance. You root for his character and expect other characters to sympathise with him. Since, the character is always inside the car, you only get to see the close-up and medium close-up shots that really allow you to have a strong emotional connection with the character. It makes you feel like you're inside the subject's mind and you can feel what he's going through. There are scenes where Tom Hardy's nuances and minute improvisations completely absorb you and make you in sync with his thoughts and emotions. The scene where he's about to confess his infidelity to his wife or the scene when Katrina asks Ivan if he really wants her to give him Cassidy's number so he can close the road. These scenes will stay with me for a long time. The way Tom Hardy emotes himself in those scenes, it just furthers my prolonged belief that this man has really got some oscar-worthy work inside of him and one day i can see that belief being manifested.
Since, the entire movie has been shot at night, the movie creates a stronger impact on you. The street lights perfectly set the tone for the movie. The cinematography is visually compelling.Each of the supporting voice characters has done an excellent job. Olivia Colman (as Bethan), Ruth Wilson (as Katrina), Tom Holland (as Eddie) and the rest of the cast are amazing in their respective roles. Even though they are only heard off camera and never seen on screen, they still give the exact impressions of their mental and physical states through their incredible Voice-actings.'

But unfortunately there were some key problems with the plot and script that wrecked the whole premise.Let's start with the first question, how come Locke was the only competent person involved in the running of a key stage of a multi-million pound project, with nobody else apparently having a clue what to do, in fact only one other employee seemed to be working there?When Donal has had too much cider to drive, why does Locke tell him to run? Donal actually says ""I nearly got run down by a taxi there"". Why hadn't he taken a taxi himself?Why couldn't he tell his wife face-to-face afterwards? How come his wife didn't seem to know he was involved in one of the biggest construction projects in Europe, and that there might be last-minute things he needed to sort out (i.e. when he was trying to get Cassidy's number)? And given he was only 90 minutes away from the hospital, why did he think he couldn't be with Bethan for the birth and then drive back to the site in good time for the 5:25am start? He'd already said he planned to be back home the next day (notwithstanding that if he hadn't been going for the birth he wouldn't be at home, he'd be at the site).As it was, there were no real twists or turns, just a succession of unbelievable events.

Most of the time he doesn't appear to be wearing his seat-belt, and sometimes (while driving at 90) he is reading from the binder while driving. It is a miracle no-one is killed. The drama reaches a climax when we are unsure if the stop/go road closure on vale road will actually get a council permit in time for the duty officer at the police station to be informed, and in the meantime it is clear that the shuttering for one of the pour pumps is not to standard and must be fixed by an emergency crew of polish builders.

Vocal contributions from top Brits such as Olivia Colman, Ruth Wilson, and Andrew Scott allow dialog within the confines of one vehicle, and the three turn in surprisingly deep performances despite a lack of screen presence.At a mere 85 minutes, not a single moment is wasted or thrown away. While at times pacing is slow, it's a methodical movie and the plot line is very deserving of the development. While the film is well directed and written by Steven Knight, it's heavily reliant upon Hardy. Despite a very real cold and a rigorous filming schedule (done over a few nights as filming occurred chronologically and repeatedly), he gives a true tour de force.In many ways, Locke is a modern take on a Broadway show, although it lacks the intensity of a few others of its kind, namely The Sunset Limited (more on that later). Every bit of acting is based around handsfree bluetooth in a car. It doesn't get much more 21st century than that.

If this film had interesting story - it could be amazing. Like a radio drama on the whole other level. But it missed spectacullary. At least it worked as a veeeery long BMW commercial.

Tom Hardy gives a great performance, and for this claustrophobic episode, he tackles some strong family issues, conflicts with his work as some sort of construction manager – which in turn, is his art, and issues with his dead father, which he monologues towards the backseat of his car.2. This movie is not a film, rather, it's a stage play combined with a commercial for BMW. For that, it presents itself with the most minimal of a set – a highway and a car. For such a minimal film, lingering on the BMW logo for that long is distracting and completely unnecessary.The problem with the film is that because it is such a stage play, there was so much space for pushing the experimental envelope, so-to-speak. We end up having to watch Tom Hardy rub his eyebrows for the 50th time in distress, a blurred out highway, or some view of the road.Cinematography in this film is not very dynamic, nor does it react at all to what's going on in the script. The only thing that carries this film is Tom Hardy's performance, and that's a problem, because I would rather sit in a theater to watch this, rather than watch lazy camera work, lazy editing, and perhaps this writer should have stuck to being the writer, and not directing.",Locke

For what it is, this film is absolutely extraordinary. Tom Hardy puts on yet another clinic of masterful acting. The writing and script throughout most of the film are delightful and engaging.
But, unfortunately, that's about all there is to this film. It's not a bad thing at all. I loved this movie. But there is little to no musical score and honestly, the ending left me feeling quite unsatisfied. It may be argued you aren't supposed to be satisfied by the finale, but I felt like the film, and thus the audience, needed some sort of closure that we never got.
All in all its a great film that I recommend, especially if you are just there to see some top of the line acting. But I wouldn't expect a real blockbuster, as this film really just does exactly what the summary states: it follows the 90min of a man's life as he takes a drive, during which his life begins to unravel (in admittedly the most thrilling way possible).",Locke

Made on a budget it has a taught script and is accomplished story telling. Basically each phone call chips away at a piece of his life and the successful works manager with an ideal family looses everything. A bit like the Job story except he is the author of his own destruction. Tom Hardy is the only character you see in the film and carries the drama superbly. Olivia Colman his wife oozes character and pain through the hands free car kit. Basically a morality tale of infidelity where the man can not bring himself to see that some things when broken can not be fixed. There is no neat ending. no conclusion. Another voice on the phone mentions 'Waiting for Godot'. I wonder if the writer Steve Knight is doing his own Godot here? There are some striking similarities.

343,Kvamsable,Hop in the car and don't forget to check the rear-view mirror.,10,11 May 2014,"Have you ever seen a film that does one thing so well, perhaps even perfect, right off the bat, and then the rest of the movie doesn't keep up? This is not such a film.Locke is set completely in the driver's seat of a BMW on the motorway to London. The eponymous Ivan Locke has decided he needs to get to London immediately, even though that means missing his most important work assignment ever the next day, and also not being there for a planned family night of football and sausages. His reasons for doing this are explained through a series of phone calls with his boss, his work mate, his wife, and his kids. He also elaborates on his feelings through a series of monologues, and you really get to know him and why he makes the choices he does. This film is being classified as a drama/thriller, and there is actual tension in it. The impressive thing is how that tension is built about events which outside the confines of the film may sound mundane. You'll find yourself sweating and cheering as Ivan solves problems related to the pouring of concrete.Despite never getting to see the people Ivan talks to, they are fleshed out enough that you can emphasize and sympathize with them. The audience is allowed to make up its own mind about whether Ivan is in the right, or if he is in fact the bad guy of the story. Tom Hardy's performance is magnetic, as he commands your attention while displaying a range of emotional states. A single location film like this will topple if the actor at its core cannot support it, but Hardy is thoroughly solid.All of this makes for a solid low key thriller, but what drives it home(no pun intended, seriously) and makes it near perfect, is the way it is shot. As mentioned, the whole thing takes place in a car on the motorway, and it never cuts away from this setting. For the entirety of the film, the lights and sounds of the motorway are present in a way that completely immerses you, and makes you feel like you are right there in the car with Ivan. This is the linchpin of the film.Locke runs a lean 85 minutes, so you'll be in and out of the theater quickly, but most likely the film will stay with you for some time longer.Personal note: I was seriously debating whether this was a 10 or not, and opted to give it a 9 now so to be able to happily bump it up upon re-watching it, instead of having to do the opposite.",Locke

The rag cannot but stumble, but it will never leave alone a woman who has decided to give birth to a child for herself. Even after the rag has been fired, he despicably pretends that it is not. Intrigue is important, although surprisingly not fun.The whole film rag-Lok communicates with an aunt over 40, who decided to give birth (unlike a rag that does not solve anything), composts her brains, with his wife, who at first does not know that the rag-husband cheated on her, and she has to make a decision. what to do next, and he is a rag, he does not know how, he cannot help but lie, with his sons, who also need to say something (they are still small and hardly understand how their father turned out to be a mean rag), and even go over the brains of the ex the assistant (who will obviously be very happy when he hears about the firing of the rag), creating the appearance of leadership and endangering the lives of people at the construction site.He's just a rag, unreliable, like vomit, and will do everything in a way that is not necessary. And it doesn't even matter how the rag's adventures end, because from the very beginning nothing good is clear. The director shows us that there is nothing more useless than such simple rags, because of which the world is falling apart, and the birth of a new little person, who, perhaps, will also be made the right rag, because the rag-Lok himself will bring him up.

Thorough the different conversation he entertains, you get to discover the dept of this man's dedication to doing what is right, and the causes and consequences of his very dedication.The abundance of this movie has nothing to do with the obvious diversity movies bring you through explosion, vast location of scenes and multiplicity of characters, but rather through the simple interactions and silences Tom Hardy maintains with ghosts of the past, family members, co-workers, and himself.",Locke

Apart from the story, the movie conveys a message that stimulating people's minds and imaginations does not necessarily require cutting- edge visual effects or a science-fiction rooted story. There are many ways to do that, and when you see the movie I assure you you will ask yourself ""How on earth did they manage to craft such an extraordinary movie with such a straightforward story?"".This movie has a pure and creative story flow which keeps you follow with all the focus.

I must say, I've never been a fan of these type of ""single scenario"" situated movies, like ""Buried"" with Ryan Reynolds, etc. However, this movie proves to be different. The plot is an interesting ""real life"" kind of plot that develops well with Hardy's fabulous performance. Although you never get to see another character, you get to know everyone in the movie fairly well enough for it to draw you in til you can't wait to see how it resolves.I'm entirely sure I loved the ending, but it wasn't a bad ending. I can certainly think of many friends that love those kind of unresolved endings. Ultimately for me, Tom Hardy's acting and ability to carry the plot was what made the film a good watch. Coming from seeing him in The Dark Knight, and from seeing him in Warrior, this is a totally different side of him that is nice to see on screen.

I found it very good for Personal reasons, but not only. The argument and the script are a lesson. O film with a very classic narrative strategy exploits such as ""Odyssey"" of Homer, the hero's journey. Not the homecoming, but the departure. But if the quality of the argument has a dimension classic, the film then explores a new concept of current lives, ubiquity.

I wanted to cheer him the whole movie as if he could hear me. Give him a hug. Because he is dealing with the ultimate breakdown of his life and he is dealing it like a real man. He had so many things to give up, but he didn't, even if it costed his most valuable people in his life. He was so alone. Nobody who could understand his situation, except us, the audience. He did f**k up, yes. But he admits it, enforces the abstinence to blame other people. - Narration: Such a unique way to present events with dialogue and real claustrophobia, which allowed us to feel what Ivan was feeling. And it's not just me admiring its authenticity, but how it's applied to perfectly manipulate our feelings successfully. - Cinematography: Haris Zambarloukos made an excellent performance with the camera usage, the lens selection, the use of colors, the double expositions, and most of all, the ""making the impossible possible"" of shooting in a car. Hoping to see his future works. - Direction: I must admit this is the first movie i saw from Steven Knight, and I hate myself for it.

His car trip was only a few hours, why didn't he just drive back to work the next day? Why was he ironing out major details of the biggest job of his career the night before? I worked as a construction manager for many years, and the dialogue about his job sounds absolutely idiotic. I suppose it might slide by anyone who hasn't spent time in construction, but it was a distraction for me and also indicative of the other flaws in the writing. The moral ambiguity and question as to whether he was a responsible person or absolute moron is what made the film interesting and kept me watching to the end, but I would really like those two hours of my life back now. Here's the real spoiler: Ivan Locke is a douche. The kind of douche who ignores the feelings of everyone around him because he insists he knows what's right. The kind of self-obsessed douche who talks on his phone while driving on the freeway because he believes everything is all about him. kept hoping there'd be a surprise ending where he was pouring his heart out to his wife making some real progress towards personal growth and BAM! Killed by an 18 wheeler because he should've been driving instead of talking on the phone. That would've been an interesting twist but alas, no. The final disappointment this film had to offer me wastjat in the end he just goes on being a douche.",Locke

Even if you come back to it, to only watch one random scene you will end up watching at least half an hour.The movie is similar to a book in some ways, it requires the use of your own imagination and your perception of the world and people, so I suppose the movie will be different for everyone.Some compare it to Buried, but to me Locke is a better movie. The story is more complex, characters more likable and understandable, it's more grounded in reality and more interesting even though less seams to be at stake.You just might see a bit of yourself in Locke. We need more movies like Locke, and more people like Locke.",Locke
369,bartgdsmith,"Tense, Emotional, and Minimalist",8,13 November 2021,"This entire movie is just Tom Hardy driving a car and talking to people on the phone, and it's pretty fantastic. As his character, Ivan Locke, is the only onscreen presence, the entire story is told through the conversations he has on these calls, as well as some tense words with himself. As the story unfolds, it will become clear where he is going, why he feels compelled to do what he's doing, and what he may be giving up by doing so.Since he's present for the entire runtime, Hardy had to carry this whole movie on his shoulders. Though he's known for his bigger-budget action roles, he has a surprising amount of range and depth, seen here in his performance as a flawed but decent family man trying to do his best to keep both his professional and private lives from collapsing from the driver's seat of his BMW. Hardy does an amazing job conveying a wide range of emotions through his facial expressions alone, and both he and the actors on the other end of the line do a superb job of creating and maintaining the tension that underlies the entire film.Predictably, there isn't much going on as far as the visuals go: this is a low-budget film confined to the inside of a car, and it's all about the performances. This includes excellent additions by the voiceover actors, such as Andrew Scott, Tom Holland and Ruth Wilson. The filmmakers clearly understood that watching a man driving a car, no matter how compelling the story or the performances, would wear out its welcome before too long, and wisely kept the runtime down to under an hour and a half. This is fitting, as a smaller-scale story like this one doesn't really need to be dragged out longer than that.If you're a fan of Tom Hardy, enjoy character studies or simply want to see a kind of storytelling that you're not used to, there are certainly worse ways to spend 80 minutes.",Locke

Tom Hardy's acting is very good - I completely bought his father character and they clearly went to a lot of trouble to flesh out his character, through his family history with the characters father.If you're expecting a really eventful plot, there isn't one, it's more like you're driving with someone and finding about their life and that part for me is authentic.My problem with the film, is because the film relies on those conversations to move the plot forward, it takes you out of that realism.Your listening to conversation after conversation, and it starts to sound like you're listening several radio plays on the telephone.I guess for me the concept didn't really work.",Locke

Ivan battles and tries to resolve his past mistakes while on the phone with his employer, colleague and family. Some may see the film as a sad expression of a man who loses his whole life and gains nothing. Instead the film should perhaps be seen as the portrayal of a man who takes responsibility for the wrongs he has committed and attempts to resolve them despite the potential crisis of marriage that could result. Ivan Locke dedication to being at the birth of his child, with a women whom he had an affair, even when the choice could cost him his marriage, is brave and beautiful to watch.

Tom Hardy is marvelous as ""Locke"" and the story is very well etched out. The inherent irony that is depicted in the movie , where on one hand there are two things coming to life, the building that is going to rise and the baby that is going to come into the world, as compared to everything else that is crumbling around, all in the space of one long drive is mesmerizing. And there also, Locke is not a saint, he acts like a normal human being, he gets angry, he cries in sadness, he laughs, he acts a little crazy (talking to the non existent dad and all), but he still keeps going on.It is the perfect example of how you don't need to spend millions in special effects, expensive famous actors,lavish sets to make a great movie. It is the story that counts. From the voices, I would say Andrew Scott as Donald was the best, but I am biased because of him being Moriarty and all ;).

The lighting, street lights and background music makes the viewer feel the exact environment. The timing of calls and the adding conversations and the situations is perfectly assembled. Everything is normal and astonishingly catchy.

We were taken, quite literally, on a journey with the character of Ivan, but there was no conclusion. Every journey has an end point, but this doesn't even have the decency to do that. Don't get me wrong, as I said, Tom's acting was believable and I genuinely wanted to know what the outcome was going to be. However, I didn't find myself relating to any of the characters, or really gunning for anyone to triumph! It was just a bit bland.

I couldn't get my head around the welsh accent it was a total put off. He didn't carry it off well and would have preferred him to have a London accent. He wasn't continuous throughout the film and it was off putting. The storyline was alright and watchable. But definitely won't be watching again. The score was better because it was Tom Hardy!!!!!

When a good man like Ivan Locke finds his world crumbling by something that he's responsible for, he just doesn't choose the easiest way out. Instead, he sticks around. This movie just shows the importance of doing the right thing. Even if it hurts, even if you can't clear the damage you've caused, the only thing you can do is execute the plan. Go through your wrongs and do what it takes to make it right, One by one. The end result may not be what you imagined but at least you have done your part.The whole movie happens in a car but that doesn't stop you from getting involved with the story and relating to what characters are going through.

Basically I think the whole point of the film was that a man, portrayed very well by Tom Hardy, is attempting to do the right thing...even though in doing so he is doing and has done a number of wrong things, and therefore I really didn't come away feeling I had learnt anything from this film. Apart from maybe a little bit more knowledge about concrete which Locke is so passionate about. In this they also made him welsh. No one else in this film was welsh, therefore why make him welsh? All I can think is that he maybe put on the accent once and everyone thought it was really good and therefore allowed him to play a Welshman in this film. Overall I feel robbed. Tom hardy could have been out to such better use. His welsh accent was good but I would have appreciated it more in Gavin and Stacey. I also liked the sound of his friend Donal, and I say sound as we never saw his face. We never saw anyone's face but Tom's or ""Ivan"". I would have liked to have seen Donal's face as he sounded funny. Basically I think they have ran out of story lines for films so created one about a man who liked concrete, had an allergy all the way through - FOR NO REASON - and was probably mentally insane.

And how, in the beginning, we are introduced to a successful guy who has it all, but at the end, loses almost everything, with a little hope on the new life that is born in the last 15 minutes.There's no human antagonist in here. The bad guy is Ivan's past, who is making consequences threading his personal and professional relationships.

So much so I had to look up what he was trying to sound like. It made him less credible and I thought the character he was playing was hard to like or relate to.The concept of him being solely in his car for the entirety of the film was interesting and could have had potential, but the script didn't seem to support this. I actually got quite annoyed at his phone ringing constantly and most of the conversations were so boring I tuned out. I do agree that the situation he got himself into is fairly realistic, but his reaction to it all made it seem unrealistic. I did expect it to be more dramatic and In the end, I didn't really care about what happened to any of the characters and It didn't leave me with questions or any thoughts about the situation.If you like photography, the camera work is pretty alright.

The film gets off to a slow start with Tom driving down a motorway and starts making phone calls to family and work which slowly gives us some background to his situation. It continues to slowly unravel to reveal the pivotal decision that Locke (Tom Hardy) has made... the problem is you really don't care. You don't see enough of his family to know if he is a good family man, only that he is a man who struggles to show emotion to his family. He appears to care strongly about his work, yet not enough that he is leaving them in the lurch. The film doesn't leave you with any sense of anything really, except maybe the lost of over an hour you will never get back.

Liked the cool steady determined (welsh?) persona of the Ivan Locke character as played by Tom Hardy. In fact all the off screen characters were well acted and convincing as well. As the film progressed could not understand it as a film. Valiant attempts seem to have been made to use visual qualities to enhance the plot, but it was more and more like a film of a very good radio play. Eventually became irritated by the repeated use of slow focus from abstract light circles to tight in focus imagery. But what else was available as virtually all the 'action' takes place inside the car. The concentrated examination of the main character was valued and the help to the viewers imagination through his self examination and references in monologue with his missing father in the back seat via the rear view mirror was another visual device that was not that successful.

If listening to phone calls and watching one man travel in a car on British motorways is your type of film, go get yourself some of this. But if like me you expect an actual film, STAY CLEAR.IF they had wrote it so his baby died at the end, then i would of gave this film 2 out of 10 instead of 1, but they couldn't even add a little twist or some sort of intellectual reasoning behind the story and 1 hour 20 minute car journey.

406,jishnukb,Good acting but unfortunately a story you do not expect.,6,24 April 2014,"I had high expectations for this film when I first saw the trailer and read the spoiler free reviews. However I was bitterly disappointed and the main reason being the false pretence that the trailer portrayed. It made the film out as if it was some sort of exciting thriller with some political or criminal intent coming back to haunt the main character due to some bad decisions he made earlier on in his life. It is not! And if you walk into the cinema with that in mind you will walk out let down.Nevertheless the acting was on point (well considering you only see Tom Hardy his acting was on point, arguably his best performance to date). The characters behind the phone calls, although you never physically saw them did manage to convey their emotions well enough for you to care about them and the story to some extent.This film does deserve credit for the type of film making because it is a very different and unique attempt at cinematography (all set in a car and only one physical actor answering multiple phone calls on his journey). These type of films in my opinion deserve more praise because it's harder to narrate stories in this way than say bigger budget films but can be a hell of a lot more powerful.Overall an interesting movie with a strong enough story but with misleading/not enough plot trailers you end up watching a film you did not come to watch.",Locke
407,nickbakertest,I would rather watch concrete dry,1,19 April 2014,"Locke was the most pointless, waste of time and money I have ever seen. It is a poor excuse of a film, maybe a TV drama, even then there's not much drama just a standard day at work for your average construction worker. It really doesn't matter if Tom Hardy was good or not because it's the worse 90 minutes of film, of all time. There is not a single twist or bit of excitement throughout the whole film. You are better phoning a builder for a chat than watch Locke. I am so angry they are allowed to charge people to see such absolute rubbish, its total false advertising with all the claims that it's the most tense and nail biting thriller of the year. It is in no way a thriller or tense it is basically a builder who has done the dirty organising his work for the next day. I would rather watch concrete dry than watch Locke again.",Locke

Personally, I found this film to be very disappointing and actually depressing. Low budget films have been done before that are totally captivating and thoroughly entertaining, but this film is not one of them. In my view the plot is predictable, thin and lacks any twists and turns, as do the one dimensional charters. It did not captivate, entertain or challenge me on any level, other than my patients and my wallet. On the good side though it's good to see someone try to create a low budget film. Good camera work, but the basic plot was seriously lacking any depth. This is the worst film I can remember seeing. Not even a hint of a single thrill for me, but you might love it!",Locke

But it is literally a man on the phone in his car. He never gets out the car. They never cut to another scene. This is literally it. And I'm not a small minded person as I love any film that gives you a lot to think about but to be honest I felt like there wasn't really enough content to make the story into a big film. There is no real conclusion or reason for any of it, it seems. It could have made a mildly interesting one-man play, but that's about it. Another thing that annoyed me is his welsh accent, and it wasn't a terrible accent but it wasn't quite right at times either. But the fact that his wife and kids were all talking with an English accent lead me to believe that maybe his welsh accent would come into the story at some point of how he came to live in England, etc..Nope! There was no point to that either and if anything it just served as a distraction.",Locke

I knew very little about this movie and it turned out to be better than what I thought it would be. This movie did not blow my mind but it was a very enjoyable film and one I would happily watch it again. However I appreciate this movie is not for everyone, sort of an acquired taste in that there are element's of isolation similar to that of movies such as phone booth. If you enjoy movies that fully develop a character as the purpose of the film, then you will simply enjoy this movie. Tom Hardy's performance in this movie, as the construction worker Ivan Lock is key to the enjoyment of this film. If you're wondering whether or not to watch this it get's a definitive yes from me.It is unusual, interesting and intelligent film.Thank you for reading :-)",Locke

The sentence delivery,the right emotions, the controlled expressions ; everything about it was perfect. This movie shows that Tom has grown as an actor. I would personally rate this performance as even better than the ones he delivered in The Dark Knight Rises as Bane and the critically acclaimed Lawless. Although, the screen play is completely different from what you normally see or expect but Tom Hardy's performance completely nails it. His role is completely different from what he has done in his previous movies. Here, he plays the role of a protagonist who is watching the world around him crumble.

There is minimalist cinema and then there is pointless cinema. What is the point in video taping a series of phone calls? Why not turn to a more reasonable medium such as an audio recording?We are immediately thrown into the life of some random executive and left to endure the consequences with him. Only problem, we aren't even given a chance to like the bloke. Why do I not get a chance to feel something for the character?I have been more emotionally moved by a snake on a hunt on Animal Planet than I was by this poor man who lost everything.

You will not see any other set than the inside of the car and some glimpse of the highway. You will not see the other characters on screen, you will only hear them over Ivan's phone. If your imagination is not good enough to enjoy a story without too much going on on screen you should avoid this movie, you will be disappointed. The story is not too shocking, it revolves around Ivan and his closest family and work, but the events lead to interesting dialog between the main character and the rest of the cast. The acting is really good and you feel like you really get to know and understand the pain of the characters and the complication of events. The storyteller does not moralize over the decisions of the characters. This shows, nevertheless, in the abrupt ending that let's you decide the very end.",Locke

This is my first review on IMDb and English isn't my native language so, sorry for the ""poor"" writing style...About the movie: What made me enjoy the movie is the cool/calm and the will of the protagonist. While watching i felt like he could have snapped at any given moment but he didn't, he stayed strong and made the right decisions (from a moral point of view). I think most of us would have given up at some point but he didn't although he kinda raged a bit. (i won't say more in fear of spoiling the movie) I didn't watch the movie with high expectations, i haven't seen any trailer or anything and i think that's why i enjoyed it.. It was something different.. I really liked the movie and would have even given it a 9 or 10 if the ending was a bit different (a bit slower maybe), even though after some thoughts i feel like this is the best ending possible..To those who didn't enjoy the movie i say, put yourself in his situation.. how would you have managed it? the feelings, the emotions etc.. those who say it's a boring movie should try to feel more than just watch..That's all from me..

If you have children, been married and in love, you will understand this movie very well and appreciate the performance. It really makes you think... a truly moving movie, but as many reviews here show - not for everybody...The most interesting thing is that one can clearly understand Ivan's motives, at least if you are also a man. He was given by a script a chance to explain himself, and he does very explicitly. He also says only nice and true ('they are desperate to work...') things about his Polish colleagues, but he should assure that they could work not only as labourers (this is why I have not given it 10 stars... - for this cliché).If you are a young or mature man - watch it and you will see what a manly behavior is, if you are a woman - watch it too and then you might be able to understand man. I love the moment when he says to his heartbroken wife that, yes, he will call his building site despite his current marital crisis exploding - this is what a true man would always do, being rationally responsible for all what is his - job, family, son, newborn child (was it a boy or a girl?) etc. A very wise movie indeed.",Locke
419,huib-schut,Road movie of sorts,10,9 August 2014,"Without spoiling the plot this small and beautiful filmed drama is an example of solid acting and a brilliant storytelling. We tune in on a builder who is about to perform one of the single largest job ever done in Europe. Except that he can't do it in person because he simply decided to take his personal responsibilities. A decision which seems to make him lose on every aspect of his live. Still, although pressured big time he stands for it, not faltering. The beauty of this unquestioned low budget movie is that after 90 minutes when the films ends you have been captivated by just watching a men making phone calls in his car. Thats it. The inside of a car, a man driving in the dark direction London making calls. It how the movie starts and ends. No special effects, no beautiful scenery shots, no sex, no drama. Still captivated from start till end. I remember Tom Hanks being praised in Cast Away for his lone acting achievement. Well at least he had a tropical backdrop, rainstorms, scenery.

I like Tom Hardy as an actor, I find him in most cases to be amusing, in this movie this is not the case. How anyone can review a man on his cell phone driving as an award winning performance is complete insanity. The people that filmed this and put this plot together would be in loved with the sequel I have in mind, driving back as the one reviewer stated, sure, but in addition to driving back, giving Tom Hardy a whistle to blow on occasion. I feel this would give the movie some great climatic moments, in addition it could possibly wake up the audience who drifts off due to the movie just plain out sucking.

My girlfriend on the other hand believed this to be a marvel of cinematic pleasure and that it possessed a greater depth which I couldn't possibly hope to conceive at which point i promptly ended the relationship and took to the open road but fortunately unlike the movie did not feel the need to spend the next 1:59 on the damn phone.

If you are an insightful and perceptive person, you will surely enjoy this film. In less than an hour and a half it demonstrates how one wrong act in life can cause the destruction of everything important in your life, and how it can inflict terrible sorrow or stress on others. It shows how in these situations, a person should take responsibility for their actions, even if it means sacrificing everything most important to them, and it shows the inevitable tensions between the various social spheres one inhabits (and the different personas we present for each) that occur when trying to do the right thing for all of them. And this is all done with one actor, in a single car journey. Genius.There are some problems. The son's acting and dialogue are pretty bad. It sounds like default 'young boy' dialogue and it's a shame because it takes you out of the experience. Tom Hardy's acting is so incredibly good that I feel like the other actors often struggle to match him. One more aspect about this film which is exceptional is the cinematography. Its cool, slick, beautiful, and impressionistic, and really gives one the feeling of being alone in a car late at night. A great film.

If it hadn't been for this I would have given this film a 7 or maybe an 8 because it is well written and I love the story and ending. Everything about this film apart from the accent is brilliant because it is original and moving. The frustrating thing is that Locke having a Welsh accent is in no way relevant and so it is completely unnecessary, especially as he requested for the character to be Welsh. I would have let it go if the accent was just slightly off but honestly at times he sounded like he was doing an Indian accent. I'm a big fan of Hardy but a lot of the time his accent was so ridiculous that it took your mind off the story. I see this film as a missed opportunity because it has been massively affected by such a trivial thing. Very frustrating!",Locke
430,mathebeni,"Enjoyable, but emotionless drama - 64",6,13 September 2020,"Firstly I'll start with the negatives, because let's be honest, it's easier to talk about. Some of dialogues were unrealistic and overdramatized. I watched this film with my dad and sometimes we just looked at each other and chuckled. It was probably the screenplay's fault. Almost every character were weird and didn't feel real .(Mainly the reactions of Bethan and Donal, and even the only visable character, Tom Hardy itself.) I really love him, and his performance wasn't bad by any means, but his character was. I couldn't indentify with him, because what he does is just simply dumb. His father left him and he doesn't want to be like him. The screenwriter tries hard to explain his action, but this father thread was very weak, and irritating. I really can't say more about this, I felt here the same as most of the dialogues: Overdramatized. What i mean by that, is that the characters react much stronger, harder than they would in real life. So I can't feel catharsis when Tom Hardy speaks to his dead dad. Even if this thread wasn't really weak, I couldn't understand why did Ivan decided to do this. He leaves two of his children for one child, whom Ivan doesn't even know his mother. He didn't know his wife will go crazy hearing he made someone a baby, but even if his wife is less dramatic, and wouldn't fired him from home immediately, he couldn't grow up both child. And that's another thing I don't understand. For a child it doesn't matter if you are there when he is born. The important is to grow him up. The child will not even remember you. Maybe it's an instinct action, but then there is my question. What does the film want to say? We hear the baby crying, happy music, happy ending. Why is it happy? He didn't even arrive at the hospital. I felt like the screenwriter at 90 pages said that okay, I am done, finally i reached page 90, I made a feature length screenplay, now let's finish fast. I was waiting for something that will give meaning to the film. But no. Our protagonist ruins his life with no character development and happy end. Maybe the message of it is to don't let anyone control your life. Trust yourself. But after the ending it feels like the opposite of this. Or just shows how stubbornness can ruin your life... I know the meanings of movies go far behind some one sentence explanations, but what i want to say is that I really didn't feel it was a passionate movie. Despite of the negatives i didn't dislike this movie. I appreciate that it was made from really low budget. It offered me some new experiences I've not really seen in movies. Little bit like books: We can't see the people Ivan talking with, you only hear them, so it is up to your imagination. So all in all it's a once watchable movie, which most of you'll enjoy.",Locke
431,samwattisbirmingham,boring,5,30 July 2015,This film felt like a waste of an hour and a half. It was similar to phone booth with the fact that the main character Ivan spends nearly all of the film bar about 2 minutes at the start in his car talking on his mobile through Bluetooth and after half an hour I was thinking is he ever going to get to his destination or stop at a service station . Not my cup of tea at all and would have been very cheap to film as you don't see any other actors hence the rating.

Other than that the film was interesting and it reminded me allot of stressful days at the site.

This film is a portrait of the central character, Locke, played by Tom Hardy. This character is so well developed and portrayed, that one quickly forgets the whole movie takes place completely inside his car, the other characters only appearing as voices on his phone. There are many things that impressed me with this movie. The themes of honour and duty in personal relationships, and in the workplace. The strength of the character, under immense pressure, to creatively and stubbornly navigate through a variety of complex issues, with limited resources and time, finding a way forward in the obscurity of distance even when others on the ground see no way, want to give up, or fail to recognise the importance of the work they are doing. I was reminded many times of a colleague of mine whom I respect and admire, an expert in his field, who I have seen on many occasions do exactly this. I have done this myself. I want my children to see this movie, and learn from it.

Less entertaining than watching someone else play video games and never giving you a go.I kept waiting for something visually interesting to happen; The film ended and all it got from me was a big ""huh.""Film is a visual media and should be visually interesting - watching Tom Hardy talk on a phone while driving down a dark highway may make a good scene, or short film, but not a feature length project.Sorry Tom Hardy, you're a good looking guy but to quote Butthead, ""you're no Don Johnson.""",Locke
445,filipbulic,One movie one actor,9,2 June 2021,"I watched this movie years ago when it randomly came up on the TV and sat watched the whole thing. Was really impressed by the style of the movie (with only one actor) reminded me of a monodrama (like in a theatre) or a radio drama (when radios were still a thing!). Anyway, great acting by Tom Hardy, great camera work, editing and directing! Can't wait to rewatch it!",Locke
