0,kosmasp,Starting off good with a message,3,3 May 2020,"A found footage missing girls film - who'd have thought it? Well I guess it makes sense sort of. And the movie does start off rather good. The teenagers talk a certain way (especially when not supervised by parents/teachers/adults) and it adds a notion of realism to it.But that gets broken later on, moreover than not. When a ""friend"" has a predictable over the top breakdown that makes no sense, to name just one example. At the time this was made they could not have them filming themselves with their phone, so the old ""why even film this?"" comes up quite a lot. And this rings even more true for the last 20 minutes.Yes the message is important and kidnapping (literally) with abuse is a bad thing. There was no need, nor did it make sense in the internal logic of how the movie was told, to get shown what we get shown. Not to mention the existance of that video or why it was thrown away to be found by the police (conviniently of course). Shocking and disgusting the filmmaker himself admits that people walked out, but sees it as necessary still ... if it wasn't for that strong beginning, I'd have gone with a 1 star rating myself",Megan Is Missing
1,paul_haakonsen,"They went missing, and...?",4,26 January 2013,"This movie was nothing at all what I had expected or hoped it would be. The first three-fourths of the movie is basically just teenage girls goofing around, trash talking and being teens. However, I will say that the last quarter turned out to take a more interesting twist, however, it hardly made up for suffering through the first three quarters.You should take heed that there is a lot of explicit sexual dialogue in the movie, which I sort of found inappropriate and too much, especially coming from girls who were only 14 years old.The story is about a teenage girl who meets a stranger on the Internet, and then ends up missing. The whole community is in an uproar, searching everywhere for the missing teen. Then her best friend goes missing as well, and no one knows who is behind the ghastly abductions.Acting-wise, then ""Megan is Missing"" doesn't really hold anything overly impressive. The performances put on here are adequate, but not memorable. And I was mostly just offended and outraged at the way the teenagers behaved and talked, more than I had feelings or sympathy for them. So on my account, the movie failed to properly deliver its messages. And it was only the more gruesome events in the last quarter of the movie that managed to fully turn out to be interesting in my opinion.""Megan is Missing"" is the type of movie that you watch once, and then never again. For a movie that is based on real events, then it turned out to be a rather one-dimensional and non-emotional portrayal of the events.",Megan Is Missing
2,trashgang,Please wake me up when it's over,3,6 July 2015,"So much controversy about this flick, it is said to be shocking or even disturbing, you can find it on lists about cruel flicks so I thought I was going to see hell.After seen it I admit, I was tortured by watching this ultra boring flick. Based on true events, which one? Based on several events yes, but that's normal. No sorry folks, it's a lot of blah blah and in fact nothing happens until the last 22 unedited, sigh, found footage, yeah right. Even that part was not shocking at all. Some may be offended by the two fetish pictures.Shocking may be the talk of a 14 year about blow jobs given at aged 10 and being abused by her stepfather, cliché cliché...Inwas looking forward to see this acclaimed flick but no I have seen it....I hope the laster tape got missingGore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 0/5",Megan Is Missing
3,HumanoidOfFlesh,Surprisingly unsettling cyber predator flick.,8,16 February 2012,"Two teenage girls become victims of cyber sexual predator who lures them into their torture and deaths via posing as skaterdude 'Josh'.""Megan Is Missing"" is a collection of retrieved footage from their computers,camcorders and cellphones.The film is quite realistic and becomes downright disturbing during its final 22 minutes.Unfortunately some of the acting is pretty bad and the behavior of 14 year old girls is often despicable.Little girls from good homes snorting cocaine and giving oral sex?It's unreal and I ain't prude.Admittedly surveillance camera footage showing Megan's apparent abduction is very eerie as are two glimpses of her fetish photos.""Megan Is Missing"" will make you uncomfortable especially if you are parent.Check it out in pair with equally disturbing ""Baby Blues"".8 online predators out of 10.",Megan Is Missing
4,videorama-759-859391,Don't miss Megan,8,15 November 2016,"MIM, I would say, is a movie that would give a few parents nightmares for nights to follow, but it's a movie that every parent should see. First off, dispel the negative reviews. This is one of those films like Wolf Creek, for example, that's still turning around my head, again because of the so real situation, but girls meets a worse fate than Mick Taylor. Two girls, best friends become victims of an internet serial child predator, passing himself off as this young surfer dude, who looks like someone out and Home And Away. Megan is this very popular high school girl, the one that everyone loves and respect. Her best friend, Amy is the other end, sensible, outcast, virginal type, who Megan's friends and other people make fun of. Girls can be so mean, and besides Amy, I didn't like any of these other girls, while not regarding Megan very highly either. But with the masks removed, these are how real girls act, or are they cliche's from other 2000+ films. The way it's shot, using less lighting, really worked making it come across as a Gregory Dark film, while the first half of the film, feels very much like Larry Clark. Some inventive touches were great too, like the reenactment, of Megan's abduction, sprouting some amusing moments, on part of the actor's sake here. Also the news bulletin segment of film, again coaxing me into the belief these were real characters. That's what Blair Witch, did. But even though fictional, in this film, they couldn't be closer than the truth. With the two girls here, who I first believed to be real people, it had me at a bit of alarm, when judging by the dates of the disappearance, where one month later, here in Adelaide. February 2007, a young girl, Carly Ryan,, another victim of an anonymous internet sicko, was murdered. The last twenty minutes of the girls's terror and torture here, is a hard watch, where the killer has taken them to his lair in the woods. His face has been kept hidden, and some images in this last part of movie, involving blood and death, won't sit well with a few. The lengthy Amy begging/digging scene is one of the most affectingly disturbing and discomforting scenes I've ever seen. It just goes on and on, you really want it to stop. Although Megan Is Missing isn't the greatest film ever made, this good film, is an educational drama, and warrants viewing from parents and teens. The three stars are good too, especially the girls, our lead with a bolstering performance. The way the movie's constructed and told, I really liked, again the early as with dialogue, it was very Larry Clark'ish. Like Thirteen, River's Edge, whatever, this is one of the more important teen films.",Megan Is Missing
5,jtindahouse,"An extremely tough watch, but a rewarding one if you're up to it",9,16 November 2020,"As a big fan of the ""found-footage"" concept I'm a little disappointed in myself for never having heard of 'Megan Is Missing' before today. It sounds like someone on TikTok has given life to the film nine years after its release, and now people are watching it in droves. I couldn't be left out of something like that so I too decided to watch it tonight. Boy oh boy, this one is dark. Very few films have the capability to unnerve me these days, but this one did the trick. The final half an hour or so of this film is bone-chilling - and I don't say that lightly.The thing about the ""found-footage"" genre is that it not only lets filmmakers get away with having poor acting or choppy dialogue in their script, all of those things can actually add to the authentic feel of the film. The characters in this movie are admittedly very poorly written. The main two girls were actually okay, but all of the side characters are just way over the top and unnecessarily and unrealistically mean. Also the news bulletins that feature through the middle of the movie are extremely poorly done. But because of the way the film was made, and the cheap, grimy feel that it's almost going for, none of that ruined the film for me at all.Now I see people calling this an important cautionary tale and saying that all young people should be shown it. I agree and I don't. I agree it's a lesson they wouldn't soon forget, but I also could see it messing a lot of them up. This is a film that could be very hard to sleep after watching, particularity if you weren't fully prepared for what was coming. Someone clearly hurt writer/director Michael Goi along the way in his life, but the result was an incredibly powerful piece of film-making that I'm glad I got to see. Thank you TikTok for bringing this to my attention. I recommend this one, but viewer be ware, it's not an easy watch.",Megan Is Missing
6,begob,Taken from behind - the diner episode,6,3 July 2015,"Two giggly teen girlfriends - yin & yang - skirt the edge of destructive behaviour. When one falls in, will the other follow? Oooh - it's a love/hate movie. It comes in three parts - don't know if you can call them acts, because the gaps are big.First part was good and engaging, a fly on the wall depiction of teen girls with all their affectations and innocent expectations. Bad acting? No way - they played it just right. There was even a scene where they mocked over-scripted web cammery. But my rage-ometer did tick over in the party scene, which is a sign of audience manipulation - no fault of the actors, just the writer/director setting up false targets.Second part took it down for me, with all the bogus news stuff. I hate that kind of hair-sprayed propaganda, so the only way it was going to work was as satire - but satire is a distraction in this kind of movie, especially when your attention is drawn by rolling headlines at the bottom of the screen full of the dreck every human being should ignore.And the third part - the notorious 22 mins. Interesting, but not for me. Basically it gave me one chill. Way too long - I spent most of the time thinking how to make it better (won't do spoilers - you probably have your own ideas), and while I did feel sorry there was no gut punch.The epilogue was very touching, and really drove home the point of friendship and innocence in a dirty world. Overall, interesting but disjointed.",Megan Is Missing
7,deatman9,grisly and terrifying,7,11 November 2012,I watch a lot of horror movies and other disturbing movies and very seldomly a movie will make my gut wrench and make me want to look away. This was one of those movies truly one of the most disturbing I have seen. Even when their just in mid conversation the movie is disturbing because it features such young girls it really makes your stomach turn.The best thing about this movie however has got to be the writing and direction. Even though a lot of the scenes are pretty implausible if you put past that they feel very real. The acting feels very real from megan. Amy was annoying at best and the side cast was pretty atroctious at parts but need not to orry most of the times its megan talking.This movie is about two young girls who are best friends. It strikes everyone as odd because they are polar opposites of one another but they use each other for their own indivudual needs and it bonds a wonderful relationship. Soon they start talking to a guy online and after meeting up with him Megan goes missing and Amy hunts out to try ti find her.This movie was really good but honestly if it had better actors it might have been the best horror movie I have seen. I just loved how they had those very long scenes long conversations some people hate that but its makes the film feel real which this one did wonderfuly I have been watching horror for years and this might be the only time I actually got scared.Wow.,Megan Is Missing
8,asda-man,It isn't just Megan that's missing,3,7 July 2016,"Every self-respecting weird person who's looking to get disturbed has heard of Megan Is Missing. The only reason I sought out the film is because I'd read how so many people find it horrendously disturbing. If you hop on to the IMDb message boards (always a good place to find opinions by level-headed people) then you'll find a lot of posts by self- confessed horror movie addicts saying how they found the last twenty minutes of Megan Is Missing to be the most haunting thing they've ever seen in a horror film which is quite a big statement! I'm also one of those people who don't really find many films disturbing. The Human Centipede 2 didn't particularly bother me and I managed to watch Salo alone in the dark pretty comfortably (ish) so I'm always on the lookout for films that might actually give me sleepless nights.Megan Is Missing is atrocious. Let's get that out the way first, it is absolutely embarrassingly bad. As soon as it started my eyes widened in terror at the beyond horrendous acting from the two main characters in the film, Megan and Amy. Both of them can't act for a toffee apple and even that's being kind. Megan's wooden bedpost is probably the best actor in the whole film and steals the show. Although, let's face it there really isn't much of a show to steal. It presents itself as a true story, but this is impossible to take seriously thanks to the stilted acting and forced chemistry between Megan and Amy.As soon as the film starts we're treated to dialogue from Amy which goes something like, ""We're filming on my expensive new video camera, Daddy loves me."" To which Megan replies, ""My Daddy loves me too, slut"" and we get a painfully wooden, ""Bitch!"" Back from Amy. Such Shakespearean dialogue continues throughout the film and it's probably supposed to sound like natural 14 year-old girl banter, but the actors deliver their lines like their reading them from the cameraman holding up a cardboard sign. It's just a total cringe-fest and the characters couldn't get any more stereotypical or two dimensional if they tried. We've got Megan the confident, popular school bike and Amy the unpopular, angelic prude.There is an attempt to build up characters but it just ends up resulting in ridiculous clichés. At one point I even predicted in my head exactly what Megan was going to say as she breaks down awkwardly on camera about her dysfunctional upbringing. We also get treated to a needlessly long monologue from Megan about her first sexual experience which just ends up sounding like dialogue from a porn film. I also liked the director's idea of a teen house party complete with torch lights and girls randomly jumping up and down going ""woo!""It's a found footage film so it's essential for it to have a realistic atmosphere, which it fails at miserably. It does make for unintentionally hilarious viewing though. It's about a girl talking to a randomer over the Internet and ending up missing after going to meet him (surprise, surprise) but the film is extremely heavy-handed with these themes. It almost feels like a student film at times, especially when they try to create news footage. I actually laughed out loud at one point where they do a re-construction of the kidnapping. I also loved the part where the newsreader teases the next story about a cocker spaniel driving a car through a shop window! I'm not kidding, the filmmakers should've made a film based on that idea.Basically, the first hour of Megan Is Missing is an hilarious example of how not to make a film. But then the next 20 minutes arrive and everything changes. It's difficult to talk about the last 20 minutes without giving away big plot twists, but I can say that it did actually disturb me. The acting gets a little more convincing (big stress on 'little') and the film becomes relentlessly terrifying. The unintentional funniness disappears and we're presented with a genuinely chilling atmosphere of horror and a sobering sense of realism. Some people say that it's like some sort of indulgent fetish thing for the director but I think it's actually done in a way that's not too exploitative or gratuitous. It's actually a well-made bit of harrowing horror.So, Megan Is Missing is a film of two halves and both halves are horrendous for different reasons. The first three quarters have no redeeming qualities, whereas the last quarter has the power to genuinely shock and unsettle without over-stepping the mark or trying to be nasty for the sake of it. It's a difficult film to recommend, but if you know what you're getting in to and are a hardened horror fan then it's definitely worth one watch. Most of it is total rubbish but in the end it presented some truly frightening ideas which did haunt me and will probably continue to haunt me for some time. So that has got to be worth something, hasn't it?",Megan Is Missing
9,lareval,Can't deny it's effective for what it is,6,30 August 2021,"Say what you want about performances or production values, but this found footage movie aims to be disgusting, emotional, horrific, depressive and deeply sick. And it manages to score all of them.",Megan Is Missing
10,MattBrady099,The true has been spoken,2,27 April 2015,"You know what I don't get in this movie, why can't they freaking text each other more then use Skype all the time? Teenagers don't do that, I know they go on Skype but not all the freaking time!.Meagan is Missing is a horrible movie, there I said it and it's true this movie is not that good as some people are putting it out to be. The reason why people are defending this movie is because it's mostly the fact that the movie advertise it's self as a ""real shocking found footage film"", even when these scenes where I can hear the director in the background saying ""Cut"" at the beginning of each scene. These another scene where there go to this party and these really loud music going off in the background and you know in these found footage films where music is playing in the background and when the camera will cut away the music will also cut away, I'm kidding you here every time the camera cuts away the music wouldn't audio drop, how on earth can you f**k that up. Oh one last thing I want to bring up at the party scene where everybody at the party is suppose to be smoking weed and everybody's having a good time even when they haven't lit it or inhaling it.I'm getting pretty sick and tried of people defending this movie giving it such high ratings that doesn't even deserve it. I know I'm coming off really tough on this movie but that's called being honest and it looks like I have to be the one naming off the flaws that seemed to be overlooked by many. Don't get stress or angry with me for a movie that wasn't even trying to be something great in the first place. The acting was horrible, the director had no sense on reality when it comes to teenagers and what they do or say. Now the last couple of minutes of the film that's suppose to be ""real footage"" and I'm not going to believe that because most of it feels set up or a better to sum it up fake. At one point in this ""real footage"" a girl get's raped and I don't know about you but I swear to god she was smiling and looks like she's kind of laughing during it, I'm not pulling your leg here it's actually in the damn movie and it looks fake as sh*t. I know people are going to bring up the footage file thing that the two girls recorded themselves on Skype but the last time I checked Skype doesn't have a native or built in feature to record calls. You need to install a separate software or an add-on in order to save your audio or video conversations. And if they did recorded all that then they computer files most have no more room for storage. Overall if you like this movie that's fine good for you, but for me this movie was freaking terrible and unrealistic.",Megan Is Missing
11,PeachHamBeach,Not pleasant,6,1 August 2015,"I give it a 6 because it just seems like it's bordering on an exploitation flick. Not nearly as bad as some of Larry Clark's stuff, but instead of really good acting from frightened parents, we get bland, almost constipated facial expressions. Don't these parents give a crap? For reals? As for the 2 main characters, at first, they are your typical little spoilt brats. It almost seemed like THIRTEEN, with the popular, slutty, troubled one and the virginal, unpopular, introspective one. I don't mind that a lot of ichatting was used. It's one of the most popular ways that teens communicate these days, and movies are a visual medium. I was irritated when the girls began to chat with ""Josh"", who claims that his brother, then his dog, broke his webcam. I wanted to scream at these kids, if you can't see him, turn the camera off! You don't see Josh's face thruought the entire movie, but he is an internet predator, and these girls are unfortunately just lonely, insecure and naive enough to stumble into his trap.I have a particular hatred for shock value gore, and the horrifying fetish photos of Megan posted on some porn site were really upsetting to me, and unnecessary. We know the girl was victimized by a sexual predator/sadist. Is it necessary to strip her of every last shred of her dignity by including a simulated photo in a movie? That's why I was so angry at the publicised photos of the victims of serial killer Robert Berdella. When you show the public every last screaming moment of a victim's life, it just seems so demeaning to me. But maybe that's the point. Maybe these kinds of things are meant to make me so angry that I want to put every serial killer on the planet into a rocket and aim it at Jupiter.It's a disturbing film. Very unpleasant. Not sure if I think it's exploitation or not, but I won't be watching it again.",Megan Is Missing
12,bob_meg,"Exploitative, marginally acted, and crosses a very offensive line",1,16 October 2011,"The Internet Predator genre, freshly minted, has still yet to turn out a progeny that has anything meaningful to say to the audience other than ""the Web is dangerous, parents beware."" The teeth-gnashingly bad ""Trust,"" made by Ross from ""Friends"" (sorry, I'll legitimize David Schwimmer when he's earned it) gave us soap-opera hubris and phony emoticons masquerading as a serious drama, and now the indie ""Megan Is Missing"" serves up tepid acting and a full-on onslaught of torture porn luridness (involving PRE-teens, no less) under the auspices of a ""thriller."" This movie lost me immediately because --- well --- it starts with a bald faced lie: a lengthy statement claiming that this film was pieced together from actual footage, etc. Yes, I know it's a fiction, not a documentary. And I know Blair Witch did the same thing. The difference? TBWP actually had engaging, well-acted characters who could ""sell"" that lie effectively. But, it's immediately obvious due to the caliber of the acting of MIM that it's nowhere CLOSE to real footage...the two girls who have to shoulder this travesty seem to be reciting their lines, instead of injecting them with any real feeling or emotional realism. All the footage is coincidentally brilliantly timed , the camera left on for all the needed moments. We then proceed to follow these girls, Megan and Amy, as they slowly fall into an Internet predator's clutches. There are so many lapses in both logic and plausibility in the first hour that it's only tiresome to list them all.What really irritates me about this ""film"" is the last third. After the ""real-time"" action ends, a title card announces the last 22 minutes of footage from Amy's abandoned camera will now be played, unedited. And then we launch into a tiresome, loathsome sequence of seeing one of the girls imprisoned, raped, degraded, tortured, killed, and buried. My first big issue with this is the girl's age. Look, if you want to present the horrors of this problem (and it is a serious problem) do we NEED to see a teenager debased for this amount of time? Does that REALLY add value? I don't see it. Even in the most splatter-based torture porn movies...the victims are rarely this young, and the footage so lingering. Michael Goi, the director, seems to think we ""need"" to see this level of detail.And there, you need to ask yourselves: ""WHY?"" One look at Mr. Goi's credits gives us some clues. He directed one very tawdry soft-core back in '99, then spent a decade as journeyman DP on numerous TV and cable outings. Hmmm. Maybe he's suddenly turned into an altruistic crusader for child safety? Yeah, right. And there's a hot guy or gal in YOUR area who wants to meet YOU tonight!",Megan Is Missing

I also understand the criticism that it doesn't capture teenagers appropriately. As a parent, I disagree. This movie might exaggerate, but it is on point.

The sound work is what video chat gives you - weak, tinny, muffled. I would have added more background noise since laptop and phone mics are poor. The director had to make the camera quality slightly above what you find with a laptop and the lighting is excellent. I'm focusing on the technical details because after about 10 minutes in, you don't what happens to any of them.

15,squeezebox,After a rocky start this turns into a very disturbing chiller,6,11 February 2013,"Megan is Missing is a very effective and disturbing horror movie. While it could certainly be viewed as a cautionary tale I think that is inadvertent, much like Last House on the Left was a cautionary tale regarding buying drugs or talking to strangers. Here the destructive behavior is falling victim to online predators, and while the movie is far too exploitative to be taken very seriously it does provide a pretty unsettling ""what if"" scenario.The movie is seriously flawed in a number of ways. First and foremost is the acting and dialog. While the acting in general isn't flat out awful, the dialog never quite rings true. The actors do their best to try and make the obviously written dialog sound natural and they just can't pull it off. This is a much bigger problem in the first half of the movie when more characters populate the story, but once the movie concentrates more on Amy and Megan, both young actors turn in very moving and effective performances.Another issue that directly affects the movie's ability to come off as genuine is the fact that, while the footage is supposedly made up of camcorder, cell phone and webcam video, it appears to have all been shot with the same camera. This seriously impairs the authenticity of the footage. Even more bewildering are awkward faux news reports that are not only unconvincing but also act as an attempt to interject satirical humor into the movie and fall uncomfortably flat.When the movie works, however, it works well. There are quiet moments between Amy and Megan that are quite touching. Amy recording a video diary is also very compelling (and leads to one of the movie's creepiest moments). When shocking photos supposedly showing Megan alive are flashed on screen my heart jumped into my throat, and the last twenty minutes (comprised almost entirely of footage found on Amy's video camera) of the movie is genuinely horrifying.When it was over, I found myself to be chilled to the bone by this movie despite its serious flaws. I think the actors and director all have talent that just needs to be more focused. Only about half the movie works. But that half is quite effective and makes it worthwhile viewing. Just be warned that when the movie doesn't work it's terrible; when it does work it's terrifying.",Megan Is Missing

After this, brace yourselves because the next happenings will literally leave you with a knot in your stomach. This film is almost sending a message (in a very sick way) but you've gotta know that this stuff happens in real life. I'm also glad they didn't put anything involving paranormal activity or demons. Instead, they show the world in a sick, dark way. Problem... The acting is horrendous! Don't get me wrong, the acting shines in a few places and can be considered real. But then all the others will almost ruin the experience for you. So just a little warning there. Aside from that, the structure is pretty unique. They show webcam footage, call transmissions, and news segments to draw you into this sick drama. The structure works at times but fails at others. Then the last 22 minutes... God, it'll scar your following week. People find this movie comparable to Saw or Hostel. WRONG! This movie has a message, a point, but it is nowhere near pointless gore; I found this a nice change. This film is a love or hate it, honestly. Most people will find this movie sickening and just stupid at extents. And then the others will find the message of online predators real and move on.

This film makes you want to turn away in disgust but you want to see what happens. At one point I was almost going to turn it off as I felt like I was watching someone's horrible predatory attack on an innocent female.

Funnily enough, its the last category of review that I find the most interesting. Do folks generally read up on a film, and what its about before they watch it? I would tend to think they do. So those of you who thought this was ""sick"" - can I ask just wtf did you expect to see? An inane Adam Sandler comedy? A Hollywood blockbuster with Bruce Willis? Maybe a animated Disney film? Do you catch my drift? Why did you bother going to see this, or renting it, if you knew it wasn't for you? Many people avoid ""horror"" movies simply because they just don't like them, but in here we seem to have a few idiots who are claiming that this is the ""most disgusting film ever made"" (lol) - you really haven't seen many films have you my friends? To call this sick is a huge overstatement, and while its purely a work of fiction, I find it quite unsettling that someone here asked that the director be shot - hmm....who's ""sick"" now eh? A work of fiction inciting a work of real-life murder? Nice! Actually the guy who directed this has been around for a long time, and a lot of his work is comedy, and while I found a few bits of the movie unnerving myself, it still played quite well and it certainly didn't stay with me beyond the time it took me to watch it. Maybe it was full of plot holes and maybe the acting was a bit hammed up now and then, but for a flick shot in a short space of time, and on a small budget, I think it wasn't bad at all (that digging scene is way too long though - the first cinematic hole ever dug from start to finish without a cutaway? lol). Anyway, I suppose it would make parents of teenage girls think twice about who their kids might be talking to in their bedrooms in this age of rampant social networking. But beyond that, I've seen much sicker than this, and I didn't ask for those directors to be killed even once.",Megan Is Missing

25,samgiannn,"It's not good horror, but it is effective horror",4,6 September 2015,"Megan is Missing is a movie that deserves any scorn that it gets. It has some truly terrible acting and some weird directing choices. It's not well-made horror; it's effective horror. Megan is Missing is about two best friends, Megan and Amy, who meet a guy online named Josh and eventually get abducted and go missing. A majority of the film is just set-up for the eventual abduction of the girls. You do get to see each girl's personalities, social lives and just everything about them. Megan is one of the most popular girls at school. She has a bunch of friends, goes out drinking, and blows random guys at parties. Amy is on the opposite end of the spectrum. She's neat, doesn't have many friends, and doesn't go out much. Watching the two go through their normal days throughout the first act makes the final act so much more disturbing. The film does slow down a bit whenever ""Josh"" comes into the picture, and there are these short scenes of newscasts that are almost unbearable to watch because it has the world's most aggravating news anchor. The last twenty minutes, however, becomes unbearable for a completely different reason. The ending changes Megan is Missing from a somewhat dull drama thriller into a truly harrowing experience. There's some imagery in there that will be hard to shake for days to come. This is honestly a terrible film, but when the horror is as brutal and unforgettable as this, it is still worth a watch if you can stomach the material.",Megan Is Missing
26,dhainline1,Part cautionary tale/part parody,4,20 February 2015,"In my opinion, ""Megan Is Missing"" is part cautionary tale/part parody. The cautionary tale is the story of 2 teen girls, 14-year-old Megan Stewart and 13-year-old Amy Herman. Both of these girls are quite different, but despite the differences, they are BFFs. Megan is a promiscuous, drug-abusing honor student who has a terrible home life and a mother who is angry and indifferent to the fact that the man she was married to (Megan's stepfather) molested her from ages 9-11. She is mad at her daughter because the man is in jail for molestation. Amy Herman is a shy, insecure girl who is Megan's polar opposite in every way. She has a loving family and a father who never sexually abused her like Megan's stepfather. Megan is kind to Amy and Megan's slutty, hard-partying friends don't understand why she likes Amy. Lexie, the lesbian friend of Megan introduces Megan to a guy online named Josh aka ""Surferdude."". ""Josh"" claims he is a teenage boy who surfs and skateboards. Megan & ""Josh"" talk a few times online and Amy joins in on the conversation. It all literally goes to hell for the girls when ""Josh"" asks Megan to meet with him behind a diner and she vanishes. Amy suspects ""Josh"" kidnapped Megan and she goes to the police. The way the news networks react to the vanishing of a beautiful young girl is the parody. Megan is described as a promising role model and a lovely young girl. Another teen is missing, but he is a black boy who is barely mentioned. It is all Megan. Even Megan's bitter, hard-to-get-along with mother jumps on this bandwagon and wants her daughter back and she portrays herself as a grieving, shocked mother. The last 22 minutes go back to cautionary tale and ""Josh"" snatches Amy while she is filming herself at the bridge she and Megan hung out at. He uses Amy's camera to tape himself torturing Amy and Megan's corpse is shown to Amy. ""Josh"" kills the 2 of them and I thought the actresses who portrayed Megan and Amy were very good at portraying how stupid teens can be online and how these same teens who have been told since childhood not to go off with strangers forget this basic rule of survival. ""Megan Is Missing"" is shocking and teens should keep in mind worst case scenarios before posting anything personal online.",Megan Is Missing

31,scrapmetal7,"Almost (?) unbearable, but there's a strong movie in here alongside the gratuitous one.",10,28 May 2011,"MEGAN IS MISSING is a very bleak look into the sad and scary world of teenage girls. Megan is popular at school, but she and her mother have a horrible relationship, she has been sexually abused by her mother's boyfriends, and she hasn't figured out how to deal with other people except through promiscuity. She tries to escape with drug use, which doesn't help. A lot of her friends are also sexually overactive and drug users, so they aren't a real option for talking things out. What she needs is a good listening ear and genuine caring.Those are things she gets from Amy, another of her friends. Amy is friendly and nice and has a good heart, but despite a loving family, she has terribly low self esteem and body dysmorphic disorder. At first Amy is envious of Megan's social life until she accompanies her to a pretty disgusting drug party where an older man gropes her and punches her in the face when she resists, everyone makes fun of her, and when she finds Amy, she is being treated like a dog by a boy she is fellating.Amy begins to see that Megan's life is not so much to be envied, but the revelation does not carry over to lessening her self-punishing perspective. She sees herself as being dumpy, and she hates herself for it.So, neither of these girls have very happy or hopeful lives, and they seek validation and affirmation where they can get it.Megan starts talking to a strange boy online. Of course, if you know anything about this movie, you know the boy is really an adult internet predator.The situation goes from bad to as bad as possible. The movie pulls absolutely no punches. If anything, it shoots you in face and then the gut and leaves you to bleed out.The movie is not without its problems. For one thing, there is no upside at all. There is no happiness to balance the misery. Things start out bad and just get worse.But a greater problem is the level of gratuity with which it establishes itself. The drug party is like watching Larry Clark's KIDS or MTV SKINS, and gives the impression of being conceived from a sleazy, pedophilic perspective. I don't think the party is unrealistic, I just think it's a very extreme example of a teen gathering.Megan's interactions with her friends and everyone else are also pretty vulgar and over the top. Constant references to oral sex lead to a long discussion about it. It seems like all the over the top underage sexuality is in here for a reason other than realism.But the filmmakers, in the special features and on the packaging, claim this film is a public service, warning us of danger. I can believe them, and I want to believe them, because I don't want to believe that there is some intent to titillate in the film's final scenes. However, the party scene puts their intentions in doubt, as does the overload of sex talk. There is a demographic that will get off on all of this, and I don't blame the filmmakers for the existence of those people, but it is not clear to me how much of this was deliberately made for satisfying predators and how much was aimed at warning their prey.Yes, this movie is a call to be careful of strangers. There is also a call to just be better people to those around you, and to be better parents. Megan's relationship with her mother is horrible, and we find out that Megan's mother did nothing while a boyfriend sexually abused her daughter. This is very realistic. This is very commonplace. Just go for a walk outside and watch people and you'll see horrible parents everywhere. The screaming matches they have are directly the fault of the woman who never learned how to be a mother, who comes home and immediately takes her day's frustrations out on her daughter. The girls who are Megan's ""cool"" friends treat Amy like crap because they can. Someday all the things that are so important to them now are going to fade away and they will be left with the memory of how they treated her, and it's not going to be something they'll want to think about, but it will be something they can't take back. That's the thing. When you're cruel to someone, you can't take it back.Either way, because of or despite the filmmakers' intentions, there is a very strong, effective, and realistic movie in here, which does a very valuable thing: it makes us think. I just wish I was sure what they filmmakers were and were not going for. What is not in question is the powerful message of this movie about protecting your loved ones and being kind to people, which should stay with us forever. We all know an Amy and a Megan. Let's take a few extra minutes to tell them we love them, and to think about keeping them safe. In that sense, this is the most valuable and important movie you can see.

Even Amy's abduction took place 20 days after Megan's disappearance, Amy continued normally walking around town, going on his bear of hiding and talking to the alleged kidnapper !!!

36,BloedEnMelk,The horror of this movie is in the reality of it.,9,13 January 2012,"'Megan is Missing' is not a feel-good movie. Which is quite an understatement. And that is exactly how it's meant to be. It is meant to shock; but not simply for the shock value in the way horror movies like Hostel are made. The genre of torture-porn wants you to feel bad for entertainment reasons, even though many will disagree with me, the avid horror-fan knows exactly what I mean. The difference between a feel-bad movie like 'Megan' and torture-porn, is that 'Megan' wants you to feel bad so to give you a message. And to do so, it uses the grim reality that many people like to deny.When many people look at their teenager, they like to see them as if they are still innocent kids. At one point in the movie, Amy has a conversation with her dad telling him: ""I liked that when I was like ten dad, I'm not a child anymore."" The father reacts: ""Please do not grow up too fast Amy.."" In the scene of the party that follows, we see those seemingly innocent kids getting drunk, taking drugs, having sex. Now I am not saying that every party your kid is going to will have these excesses, but I do know one thing, when I was that age (which is about 26 years ago), we were no innocent kids either. Let's face it, as soon as hormones kick in at either gender, your child changes to an adolescent and one thing that comes with adolescence is the wish to experiment and discover. We should never underestimate that. Experimenting and discovering (to a certain level) is not necessarily a bad and unhealthy thing, it is a part of growing up. But there are dangers which we, adults, smell from a huge distance, and those kids do not. And therein lies the problem, these kids are still far too young and unexperienced to understand what the reality of this world is, what the risks and consequences of their own behavior are. Their body is developing, their brain is still not capable of smelling the real dangers of society. They think they know it all (didn't we all think that at that age?), but they are still incredibly naive. An other problem that especially girls have is that they are often far too sweet. They feel sorry if they give no as an answer to a guy who is pressuring them into something they don't really want to do. At the same time; many girls are looking for someone who 'loves' them. Who compliments them, who gives them the feeling that they are special. That combination is a very risky one. I wish it wasn't reality; but unfortunately the very ugly truth is that there are many predators walking around on this planet who prey on children and teenagers. 'Back in the old days', the pre-computer age, those predators had to walk the streets to find your (teenage) child. But since there is the world-wide-web, they can hide into perfect anonymity and lure your child towards them, without their victim even knowing how they look like. Back to the movie. Megan and Amy are such adolescent girls. They are beautiful and naive, the perfect prey. Megan is more naive than Amy, because she has a troubled past her need to find 'someone who loves her' is bigger. She has experienced more, but thinking that she knows it all, she doesn't understand that she is not invincible. Amy is the more sensible of the two, even though that makes her 'boring and unpopular' to the popular kids at school. When Megan finds this 'nice guy' online, everything goes wrong. Personally, I think the actresses did a good job. To me they were totally believable in their role as teenagers. The script has its flaws but is well-enough written, with the director using real chat-conversations between teenagers to show the reality we are dealing with. The story is composed of seven real cases. Now; about the last 22 minutes. Yes, they are shocking. They will make your stomach turn. They will make you want to fast-forward, or turn the bloody TV off. Some scenes are done in real-time, so the viewer experiences the horror the victim has to go through. It is not polished, or brushed up, what we get to see is a very grim picture of something that has been reality for quite some victims. And that is where the strength is of this movie. Yes; it is sick. Yes, we are looking at torture and it is a torture to watch. No, it is not torture-porn. It is a message, and a warning, and a glimpse into a reality which you don't want your child to EVER experience. Some horror fans complained that 'it wasn't shocking enough'. But beware; the director is walking a fine line between making a strong imprint and falling into the torture-porn category. This movie shows you the importance of educating your children against such predators. We can't stop them from experimenting and we can't stop them from developing a life of their own. But we can, and have to, provide them with the necessary tools and mental weapons so they do not fall into such a trap. Don't be naive, like your teenagers are. Do not deny the temptations they have, or the fact that they are growing up. You don't have to take away their freedom and their ways of communication, we do not have to put them in a cage to protect them. Instead, we should make sure that these kids know what the dangers are, that they learn to think for themselves, are able to say no, and are armed with knowledge so they don't fall for predators like Josh.

The fact that; although this was not based on exact events this is based on true events, is what makes it scary to watch.

If you're looking for a movie that has twists and turns while holding unrealistic events, don't watch it. However, if you're trying to decide on this movie and reading a review on it, you're probably semi-interested in this certain genre, so watch it!

I do believe you have both ends of the teen spectrum in this film and chat rooms have always frightened me, you don't know who on earth really you are talking to unless you know them personally. It's the crime that got to me. It just didn't seem realistic to me. Not the gore and violence and disturbing scenes.

40,jennifer-25-965231,Important movie that packs a hard punch,7,27 September 2011,"I had no clue what this movie was about when I started watching it. Based on the name and considering I read absolutely nothing about it I assumed it must be some sort of teeny bop slasher. To be honest I almost turned this off within the first 20min. I kept looking at my Fiancée unimpressed and asking him if this is what the whole movie was about.For the most part this movie follows two 14 year old girls and their complicated lives of living as young teens. It shows the silly things teens care about, the stupid things they do and their obnoxious behaviour. As I said, I almost turned this off thinking it would turn into some sort of Jersey Shore episode.After a while the storyline changed into a beautiful story about two little girls and their intense bond to each other. This is where I began to fall in love with the two main characters. Megan, has some serious problems in her life and you begin to understand why she does what she does. She's outgoing, pretty, has a great sense of humour and loves to party hardcore. Amy, shy, sweet and insecure idolizes Megan and has an intense bond with her. Both of these characters begin to have so much depth you begin to feel bonded with them.The movie goes on and focuses on how teens nowadays use cameras to chat with boys. They meet random boys online to chat with and this is where their problems begin. Megan, who seems to be looking for a boy who wont treat her like a piece of meat meets a boy online (who says his camera broke so she cant see him) named ""Josh"". Josh is so sweet, says all the right things and sends her photos of a cute boy saying it's him. Megan is hooked.I won't go on to tell the whole story but I do want to add that this movie disturbed me greatly. There are only two other movies I can think of that disturbed me like this and those are Baby Blues and The Girl Next Door. Maybe those two had more violence but this movie almost made me sick just like those two did.This is an important subject, with teens and their insecurity problems and naivety it's too easy to lure them on the internet. Yes this movie packs a punch and is shocking and sick but if that's what people have to do to let parents know what's happening in the world today then more power to the director of this film.Zombiesteak.com - Discover a new world of horror films, designed just for you.",Megan Is Missing

The storyline itself gets exciting in the second half. The first half is super boring. Plus the acting didn't make it any better. In the second half Amber Perkins does get better with acting but it still wasn't good enough to keep me entertained. I get that it's supposed to spread awareness and not be entertaining but i don't really see the point of the first half anyway. I missed music and above all character development. Amy didn't have a lot of friends so she could've told everything to her parents. Amy's parents were only on screen in the beginning plus when she was missing. I felt like if her best friend went missing my mom would be really scared for me and not let me go outside to parks by myself, meanwhile Amy was chilling with her bear in the middle of nowhere. I mean, yes the two photos are disturbing. But they could've built the suspense up so much better, now it was just like 'yea idk and idc here are the photos take a free coupon while you're at it, oh also, dead body'. It was so platonic.

In retrospect, my parents should have probably been more aware and involved as I met most of these potential acquaintances at the mall or movie theatre, places that were crowded enough that i would feel safe and not isolated. It would be hard not to notice a 6'3 blond male being chloroformed and dragged into a van, so in that sense i suppose i'd have had the upperhand. Then again, I do live in New Jersey and wouldn't be surprised at all if a huge group of people did in fact see that but were just too uninterested to do anything!I wanted to open this one up funny, because this movie is a huge bummer. it leaves you with that pitted stomach, eyes wide open, forehead wrinkled feeling. Not because it's a bad movie but because it makes a very bold statement about what can and (still does) happen involving internet predators.

Those types of rapists and killers generally still have some level of consciousness that if they were to 'accidentally overharm' and then resort to snuffing out the victim, they would hopefully do so in a way that was quick for both the attacker and the victim's sake. These are I guess what you could call the 'more desirable' types of predators out there (i know this may sound audacious.) The antagonist here is not like any of the aforementioned, he's an S&M obsessed, torturous predator that's honed his abilities to seek out the underage, naive, boy crazy types. And the rest is just really dark and does not need explanation.One of the more poignant things to take away from this film is that in the midst of crucial time that should have been utilized to do things like, I don't know, check the girls computer considering it's 2007? Nope, no proper leads are followed up on, and then there's always the initiative of 'a town banding together to find ...' Which, no offense to any of you who devoted time to causes you believe in, But I think the sort of cliché 'we're all looking for...' phenomenon that always happens is perhaps an OMEN of a bad result. People are busy typing ribbons to trees and reenacting and sensationalizing the 'story' and police probably figure that ""Eh, Town'll find em.""Scary in a real sense. I would like to think that the sequences and events that unfold after the first half were 'sensationalized' or took a lot of creative license to make the movie have more of an impact, but the scary thing is that what we see in the film is probably not even scratching the surface of what those girls went through during those (days/weeks) and that you can't rely on law enforcement to keep kids safe. The internet is not an evil place, but it's a portal through which one can be linked to human beings who are, in fact, evil.see it.",Megan Is Missing

45,Joshua_Penczek,Megan should stay missing.,1,9 August 2016,"Before I saw anything, I'll start by saying that his movie was written, edited, and directed by Michael Goi, the president of the American School of Cinematography. Somehow, despite all of his knowledge, he still ends making one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Shame on you Goi.Megan Is Missing involves a teen who goes missing due to something she does on the internet. The film is shot in an in-screen only technique, later made famous by Unfriended. The kids in this movie are unlikable brats, and the ""realistic"" dialogue they have is so over- the-top that it becomes the most unrealistic dialogue in film history. I am fully aware that teens swear up storms and it is nice to see a movie that realizes that. However, kids do not talk the way they do in this movie. In one very unintentionally disturbing scene, a young girl talks about how she preformed fellatio on an older camp councilor, and she starts spitting snot on his penis while she starts choking. According to Goi, this is a ""word-for-word"" discussion she had with a real child, and the scene goes on for like seven minutes. There are several scenes that do this; over-the-top dialogue for seven minutes before going to the next over-the-top dialogue for seven minutes. It becomes the most boring film ever made, as basically nothing happens until the last 10 minutes. There is also the singlemost worst news broadcast scene I've ever witnessed, with newscasters wearing T-shirts and transitions consisting of Windows MovieMaker-esque card flips and scene wipes.The film ends with the second worst rape scene I've ever seen (only beaten by Paradox Alice). The actress is not crying and doesn't appear to be struggling, she only whines while being raped. She is then tossed into a barrel and buried alive, and the audio of her crying becomes muffled after one scoop of dirt is dumped on top of her. Stuff like this is laden all throughout the movie. But more importantly, this film proves what is wrong with society. People see a child swearing or a child getting raped, they immediately deem it as ""realistic"" and ""horrifying"", even if it is done laughably. Michael Goi is one of the world's most sought- after cinematographers in the industry, how could he make a movie so boring, stupid, inconsistent, and terrible?",Megan Is Missing
46,dpraptor,A Very Powerful Warning,9,19 July 2018,"I have to say this movie really threw me, but with so many children going missing every year, this makes a very strong point, if not overly exaggerated. But who really knows by how much? When you see the kinds of murderers that are out there, this may not be too far from what could happen. Look at Gacy, Bundy, Pichushkin, Jack the Ripper, stalkers in general, and this movie may not be that far fetched. I say well done, I hope this movie will wake up younger people to be much more careful. All the people who down voted this probably are very selfish people who really dont care about this kind of thing happening. Good Job Michael!",Megan Is Missing
47,Gladys_Pym,Oh. Dear.,3,11 May 2011,"Where on EARTH do you start.First, I'm not an apologist for abuse - I'm a therapist who works, every day, with abuse and trauma. So I really GET an attempt to explore this issue - and warn - from the victim's point of view.And, to be fair, filming this in 8 days? Remarkable.But...I'm left with all kinds of icky feelings. True, Megan is pretty unbearable. She's become a bit slutty, offering what she CAN offer to boys because she can - because it doesn't matter that much (enough) to her, and that first harrowing trivial hour makes it clear what made her life, her body, less important to her than it should have been.And Amy? Well, she's annoying, and a bit too squeaky clean, but this is annoyingly tangled up with her own self image, when in fact it's Megan's self image that is really more impaired.The artifice of the whole film being webcam, 'phone and video is clever. Clever as in cheap, and amateurish, which works.But that last 22 minutes. Well. Sadly, it's better shot than the previous hour, it's boring in places, (digging is NOT good cinema), and, all in all, it left me, (leaves me), feeling hollow, and empty.There is a claim, at the start of the film, that this is based on a true story, but I've looked, hard, and can't find any proof.There's a terribly upsetting ""Every day 2000 parents say..."" about abduction. Gleaned from the Klass site. But on the very next line on the Klass site, this number is diminished, and also made less clear (ie. NOT juvenile).I don't know. I don't want to damn this film, and I don't want to pretend abuse isn't a terrible thing. It's just that my sense is, somewhere, the director got lost, and the producers didn't say so.I admire that this is being done - ie an attempt to raise the issue. AND that the film was clearly made on a shoestring, in 8 days. But 22 year old actresses just don't (can't) look 13, and simply because abused girls don't LOOK like they have any depth doesn't mean they don't HAVE any depth.This isn't a complete damning of this film. 'Enjoy' would be wrong, but I watched it, at least. It's just - I don't know... It could have been so much better, and it could STILL have been filmed in 8 days.",Megan Is Missing
48,Father-Jonathans_P1zza,this is not a good movie,1,24 November 2020,"Everyone praises this movie because of its message. And I totally agree with the fact that it's an important message. Abductions happen every single day. That being said though, that doesn't put this movie above criticism. People mostly praise this movie because they've been told to praise it by people on tiktok. But this movie is rife with terrible acting, an awful script, abysmal cinematography, god awful direction, and horrible editing. While yes, there were certain aspects that could disturb people (they didn't disturb me personally, but to each their own) I don't think anyone could really go as far as to say it's a ""scary movie."" I think we need to start asking filmmakers to make movies with a similar message to this movie, but which are also movies that are really well put together. Because this is pretty embarrassing. It's ok to criticize a movie like this. Even if the message is important, any movie ever made is subject to criticism. I'm also shocked that so many people are calling this the most disturbing movie they've ever seen when we have movies like Martyrs, Saw, Se7en, etc. which are infinitely more disturbing.So yeah. This is far from a good movie. Every aspect, with the exception of its message, were terrible, and embarrassing. I do not recommend this movie",Megan Is Missing
49,mikelepost,Everything about this movie sucks,3,18 November 2015,"There are so many things wrong with this movie that I don't even know where to begin. I guess I will start with the format.I'm not a fan of found footage in general, but Megan is Missing is exceptionally lazy in that it barely even adheres to this conceit. In order for the movie to work we the audience are expected to belief that teenagers in 2007 communicate almost entirely via video chat and that these conversations were recorded and stored. We are also expected to believe that photos and video of sexual assaults and murders were made available to the filmmakers. Since the film is never once convincing as found footage I have to wonder why the writer / director chose to tell the story this way.The acting ranges from barely adequate to absolutely atrocious across the board. The two main actresses are never convincing as 14/15 year olds and their performances are mediocre at best. Everyone else who appears on camera - the news anchors, the parents, the other friends - is downright embarrassing. They are not helped at all by the largely expositional and tin eared dialogue.While I am sure there are 14 year old kids out there doing drugs and having sex at random, the portrayal of those types of teens in this film did not ring true to me at all. The pervy, leering tone of the film reminded me a lot of movies I've seen by Larry Clark, where we the audience are theoretically supposed to be wringing our hands over the wasted youth of today etc. but the camera keeps ogling the hot young bodies on screen.This is particularly true of a scene where Megan recounts being forced to blow a 17 year old camp counselor when she was 10, giggling about it the whole time like it is an embarrassing sexual story and not actual rape. There are several other scenes of unnecessary sexuality in the film including a rape scene that make me feel like the film is implying that Megan deserves what eventually happens to her. That, or director Michael Goi is just a pedophile.The first 50 or so minutes of the film almost entirely consist of banal, repetitive dialogue and bad acting. Then we get to the two pictures of Megan and the final 20 minutes. This is the point where Megan is Missing shifts from being a terrible after school special and instead becomes a sadistic found footage horror film. These scenes are undeniably a gut punch and the only reason to see the movie at all.Here's the thing though: To this point Goi has positioned the film as one of those message movies that are supposed to serve as a wake up call to parents. But the film ultimately is pervy and disgusting exploitation. The director's claim that Megan is Missing is about anything other than presenting the highly sexualized torture and murder of its main characters is completely disingenuous and reminded me a LOT of the opening crawl to Chaos (2005) claiming that it was intended to save lives.The ONLY audience for this film are horror fans looking for something disturbing. That is fine, but I'm just warning you the movie absolutely sucks, nothing happens for the vast majority of the run time and you'll feel like you need a shower afterward. Consider that a warning or an endorsement.",Megan Is Missing
50,jason_leo,the only thing disturbing is why was this even made.,1,10 May 2011,"i watch a lot of movies and have come across kid related stuff before IE hard candy, the woodsman, hound dog,. how it starts is very insulting to anyone with a brain by saying its actual footage etc... 2 seconds in you know its not and the fact it is based on actual crimes that it uses mixed with fiction is disgusting to actual victims. if you think the film is made to raise awareness about danger you are very sadly mistaken as shown by many aspects of the film. three main scenes raise serious questions about the film makers intentions and whether he should be let near anyones kids. the first is the photos designed to shock you. second is the over the top up close rape scene of what is meant to be a 14 year old kidnapped girl. last but no means least is the web cam chat about summer camp. in one scene Megan tells her friend about her first bj at summer camp when aged 10 she goes on to describe it in detail appearing to not have been bothered but it but more to have enjoyed it. this scene has no bearing on the film but does raise a serious question as to why the filmmaker glorifies child abuse. really strange and very disturbing. in short the acting sucked the filmed sucked and the filmmaker should probably be looked at by they police",Megan Is Missing
51,MisterAwesome,Disturbing to say the least,6,11 January 2013,"I was directed here after viewing the The Poughkeepsie Tapes since this was kind of similar to it. I must say, the last 22 minutes were absolutely disturbing. I found that the director made pretty clear that the online (chat) world is not always what you think it is. People can make them self out to be whoever they want without anyone ever knowing. It kept me on edge thinking that something similar has happened in real life as well and the director did a pretty good job portraying it as something real. Rachel Quinn did a good job playing the pretty, popular and naive girl Megan who found herself chatting with a pedophile killer. I must say her acting came really close to realism. Amber Perkins on the contrary wasn't very believable in my opinion until the point she got abducted. Her screams and cries for help gave me the chills until the very end. Making this a found footage film added to it's value in different ways. It really felt like you were watching some crazy molester and killer whose identity remained unknown until the end. Keeping him unknown makes you feel like everyone could be him, from your average Joe you see walking on the street each day to some kind of hermit who everyone expects to be some kind of maniac. They way the killer talks while chatting with Megan and the calm he keeps while he does such horrible things is beyond me. The pictures of Megan that were shown and the last 22 minutes of the movie were totally disturbing. It was sickening and engrossing but probably pretty close to reality. It makes us viewers find out there are really people this sick on this planet and you don't have to live in the middle of nowhere to get caught up with someone like that. To me it delivered what it was supposed to do and freaked me out just thinking about something like this happening in real life. Overall i would give this one a 3.5 out of 5.",Megan Is Missing

54,smolsoft,Not great,1,22 June 2019,It's like the director had two different movie ideas and just shoved them together. The first three quarters feels like a scaremongering lifetime-esq movie about how our children are out of control and dangers are lurking everywhere. The last quarter is a horror film about a girl getting abducted and all that that entails. I admittedly was disturbed by the last quarter but that was because it didn't fit well with the rest of the movie. It was like I was watching an episode of Dr. Phil and it suddenly turned into a low budget Netflix horror movie. The acting here isn't terribly bad but the writing is awful. The message in this movie is that kids should be more careful of what they do online and who they trust online. This is an important message but there are tons of better ways to relay it.,Megan Is Missing

It shows!Plus, the last 22 minutes of the movie show very graphic scenes of young girls being raped and killed that were not necessary and do not add to the movie. Who wants to watch that?! It's just triggering and low quality.The worst part about it is the director did not put any disclaimer into the intro of the movie stating that there are graphic scenes of rape and murder and viewer discretion is advised!!!!!!!! I watched this movie thinking it wouldn't be nearly as disturbing as it was!!Unprofessional filming, poor character development, bad acting, idiotic plot, and GRAPHIC SCENES of rape and murder.

58,sethklee-77687,Really.,1,18 November 2020,"God help us for Gen Z TikTok finding this, because this is awful. Everything from the script, to the acting, to the directing, to the editing. The dialogue was so obviously written from the way a 40 year old man thinks teenage girls act. The characters are cliched (abused girl engaging in risky behavior and her goody-two shoes best friend), it's unrealistic (for instance, Amy's identity would have been kept a secret after she came forward), and there's plot holes (the police easily would have been able to track Josh down). The acting was awful, unconvincing, and forced (Charlie the cat is cool though). While the ending is not good and it's not nearly as disturbing as it's made out to be, at least it was memorable. But, combine that with some peoples' ignorance and it may be the movie's greatest sin, since it's what has led to it regaining popularity once again.When defending this movie most bring up that it's supposed to spread awareness, like it's some sort of end-all be-all shield from any criticism. But it still sucks. All it does is teach people who know nothing about the internet to be scared of it and prey on young girls' fears. At best, it's outdated. Other movies have done it before and much better, without the creepy exploitational vibe this movie gives. Hell, even those awareness ads we used to be shown in elementary school were more realistic, were better acted, and had a better message than this.1/10",Megan Is Missing
59,gavynhelfyre,"I get what they were going for, but that doesn't make it good (heavy spoilers)",2,26 October 2012,"I'm sorry. I know I'm in some sort of minority about this movie, but frankly I think it was terrible.The first part of the movie was pretty poorly written and the acting wasn't terribly much better. Far too much of this movie was told to us instead of shown, which is a surefire way to make you not care about characters that the finale requires you to care about. If a character has to tell you that they're broken, instead of you seeing it revealed through their own actions and the revelation of those weaknesses... even the revelation of their awareness of those weaknesses, then you haven't made me feel for the characters inherent sadness. ""I'll pretty much do anything as long as you tell me you love me,"" should be a heart breaking revelation... but it wasn't earned one bit. It just fell flat and made me say ""okay, so she's broken.... what a stereotype"".Frankly I think making this a found footage film was a mistake. While I'm sure it was done to try to bump the realism factor, the genre itself is so limiting that it forces awkward scenes and also some very strange moments like Megan and Amy doing some sort of video chat on their phones when they're literally on their way to each other (apparently a very short distance). It also forces one to question who in the film was recording all of these Skype sessions and why were they recording them?Moving beyond that, crucial points in the film are also gaping plot holes. When the Amy character finally goes to the police about Megan's possible kidnapper (after strangely not telling them about him earlier, you know, before the odds of her being alive shrink dramatically) they plaster her name and face all over the news. I'm sorry, but that sort of thing does not happen. Additionally, if all of Megan's Skype sessions were recorded, wouldn't the police know about Josh before hand? Also, if Josh is going around posting photos of Megan on message boards, then there's obviously a way to track him. Unless we're expected to believe that Josh is not only a kidnapper, rapist and murderer, but also a computer whiz. None of it adds up, but it's all crucial to the plot. Finally, let's talk about those last 22 minutes. I'm sorry, but if you're deeply disturbed by those last 22 minutes, you have missed A LOT of films in the last 40 or so years. The last 22 minutes felt way too sanitized, likely because of the characters ages, when held up against things like the original Last House on the Left or even the remake of The Hills Have Eyes (watching the attack scenes in those films, I felt I needed a shower afterward just to feel clean. Last House particularly felt so much like a snuff film when I first saw it, it took a long time for me to watch it again). She's kept prisoner, raped and then stuffed in a barrel with, yeah you saw it coming a mile away, her dead friend. Then we sit through a man digging a whole for 10 minutes while Amy, clearly not seeing where this is going, tries to talk her way out of the barrel. This all leads to a big problem with the climax- Amy never really seems to take her situation seriously. She never does anything but scream at Josh. She seems to think that ""if you let me go I won't tell anyone"" will be taken seriously. To top it off, even during the brief moments in these last 22 minutes when she's not chained up, Amy makes absolutely no attempts to escape. At one point there is clearly a jagged piece of metal a few inches from her head, and she never goes for it... she just keeps crying for help.Seriously?I'm sorry, but this film just doesn't work. It expects you to find it's subject matter shocking and disturbing because it's made its characters 14 years old (though the actress who played Megan looked far older then 14). This fails because unless you sell me on what I'm watching, just telling me that this person is a specific age will not make me engaged during their problems later in the film. It doesn't engage a willing suspension of disbelief. Make me care up front, or when I need to care... it'll be too late. I get what the filmmakers were going for, and I applaud the effort. I think that if they hadn't tried to cash in on the ""found footage"" boom that's been going on, they may have made a much more engaging and effective film. A film that makes you care, instead of expecting you to care because adult actors are playing characters of a certain age.",Megan Is Missing
60,mwcanadian-99023,just bad in all ways,1,20 April 2016,"**may contain spoilers* This movie is just bad in so many ways. I'll start with the first problem. the director is so bad that he yells the word ""action"" and it can be heard! That's not the best directing there. The 2nd problem is of course the acting. I give them credit for trying, but these two did not act like teenage girls, the one girl Amy was particularly bad with the one scene that causes controversy and Megan is so annoying that you kinda don't care if she did go missing.The 3rd problem is how disturbing it felt watching it. I just didn't enjoy the disturbing movie and it wasn't just disturbing for that one controversial scene, it was disturbing for the unrealistic parts. For one, Amy doesn't tell the police about Josh right away. Two, they don't really take her too seriously and somehow it gets leaked that she gave the police information. Honestly, this is a movie that should be avoided. They said it's based on a true story (or a bunch of true stories or something), but the closest true story i see is the Ashley Pond case, but that case had a huge difference. In Pond's case, she and her friend were murdered by another friend's dad and not by an online guy they never met. Ashley and Miranda didn't get picked up by an online predator, just a sicko dad who wanted his daughter's friends. This movie is trying to get the message about not falling for ""online predators"" but i think they would've done a much better job giving this message out by making a short show about online predators or supporting other movies or shows that give the message out better than this. if you want to watch it, then that's up to you, but trust me you won't enjoy it. The first part of the movie is just dull as dirt (until the director says action, then you can laugh at that) while the second part of the movie will just disturb you and the ending is just bad.",Megan Is Missing

There's another scene where there's a Skype call and you can literally hear Micheal Goi saying ""action"" in the background. The writers of this movie also forget details for seemingly no reason. Megan stays 14 during the whole coarse of the movie, yet Amy goes from being 13 at the beginning to 15 by the end. Wtf! The actual story only lasts for about a month, so how the hell did this happen? The shot quality is also incredibly blurry, staticky, and headache inducing. Furthermore, the film drags along at a snails pace and I can't even watch it as a comedy.

65,mrannum,Very Disturbing Film. The Last Twenty Minutes Are BRUTAL,8,13 August 2016,"Megan Is Missing is the fictional account of two young girls who are seduced and kidnapped by a online predator. As a fan of mockumentaries and found footage films, I'd have to say that this ranks up there with some of the best ones in the horror genre. Mainly because it's very, deeply, incredibly unsettling. From a gore perspective, it's rather tame. There is not a single scene that shows someone actually being killed. It's mainly the aftermath that you see. I found that the way this story was told was brilliant, to be honest. Its relatively minimalist approach to backstory exposition, particularly regarding Megan's abuse as a child, is incredibly effective in establishing the causes for some of her extremely questionable actions in this film. She does things that are arguably nonsensical, but when she explains how she was molested as a ten year old by her camp counselor (in EXCRUCIATINGLY harrowing detail), you kind of understand why she does those things. Speaking of acting, I see reviews that chide the performances based mainly on decisions the girls and their friends make. They seem to forget that these are supposed to be relatively clueless teenage girls, and by default are SUPPOSED to make stupid decisions. Amber Perkins as Amy Herman is particularly good in her portrayal of an innocent 13-year old girl, convincing even as the horrible things that happen to her during the last act are happening. You really feel sorry for her as she pleads for her life, rather convincingly.And that last act...sheesh.Starting with the two photos of Megan that were found on the fake fetish website in the S & M contraption, broken, bruised, bloody, absolutely TERROR-STRICKEN...those all-too-brightly-lit pictures, coupled with what the film conveys about how evil the antagonist is, had me stunned. The stark, exposed, abject vulnerability in her eyes is something that sticks with me even as I type this.Also, the way the antagonist breaks the spirit and will of Amy in the final act is positively soul crushing. The part when he rapes her is as deplorable as anything I've seen in Irreversible, I Spit On Your Grave or Blindness. As a parent to a thirteen year old girl, this movie was really hard to watch. I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of found footage horror. Very, very, very disturbing stuff.",Megan Is Missing
66,DanMovii,Absolute garbage.,1,16 November 2020,"I'm really late to seeing this movie however there's a spike in its viewership as I saw tens of thousands of people talking about it on Twitter this morning so I decided to watch as they had built it up to be some horror masterpiece but instead I was given one of the worst movies ever made.Now during my research of the this project people were comparing it to ""A Serbian Film"" and I can see why... kind of, see both movies wanted to have a shock factor now all I can say is ASF manages to do that due to it being disturbing in every way imaginable but this movie doesn't do that through its cheap production. I can see why people found ""Megan Is Missing (MIM)"" upsetting and I can see why due to the uncomfortable sequence towards the end of the movie.For some reason a lot of this movie feels like some kind of advertisement for online safety or something but it's executed terribly. The director and writer, Michael Goi's previous project was dated a whole decade before the release of MIM and just looking at the synopsis made me think this guy likes to lean on the more perverse side of things up until this garbage film caught the attention of corporations that ultimately gave him more directing opportunities for TV shows.This is the end of my review and I've barely talked about much of the film's content but that's because it has so little. Overall don't watch this movie, not because it has a scare factor instead for the reason of it being so bad.1/10. Worst rated movie on my list so far.",Megan Is Missing
67,dwoolfe99,"Raw and upsetting, but not exploitative",5,23 April 2013,"Watched this last night on Netflix. I'm a horror movie fan but was a bit unprepared for this. A horror movie uses suspense, scares, gore etc. to shock, titillate and excite the viewer. This isn't that kind of movie.In fact, I'm a bit perplexed at those who say it's exploitative. It contains no nudity. The sex scenes are non-explicit. And there is very little blood or gore. This is a low budget film with a raw and natural quality to it. It relies on hand held cameras and has very low production values. The acting, principally that of the two female leads, is passable to above- average, principally because they are being asked to play characters presumably not unlike themselves. In other words, ordinary teenage girls.The brief synopsis, for those who haven't read other reviews, is that Megan and Amy are best friends, both 14 years old. Megan is a popular girl who is sexually lose and does hard drugs. Amy is a socially awkward and unpopular ""good girl."" Amy needs Megan to feel socially accepted. Megan needs Amy because Megan has self-doubt about her life and Amy acts as her moral anchor. The bond between the two is very close.Megan hooks up with a mysterious guy online, by way of video chat in which he can see her but she can't see him. She tries to hook up with him in real life and is abducted. Amy is then abducted 2 weeks later after chatting with the same guy online. Though we are never shown anything of what happens to Megan except one disturbing photo and knowledge of her ultimate fate, we are treated to a 22 minute video of Amy's experience in captivity, which is largely non-graphic but extremely upsetting.None of this is what anyone would call ""entertainment."" It isn't even titillating in ""sick"" sort of way. These are young girls, and what happens to them elicits revulsion and pity, nothing more.This movie has the singular purpose of warning young girls about the dangers of ""hooking up"" with strangers online. In that one purpose, it is largely successful, but for the fact that teenage girls are not a likely audience for this kind of movie. The movie is loosely based on the Ward Weaver murders in Oregon (Google Ward Weaver), the main difference being that in the Weaver case there was no internet ""hook up"" aspect.",Megan Is Missing
68,realitycomments,Searching for Mr. Goodbar via internet.,1,8 June 2014,"I was going to stop watching within the first ten minutes. First of all I didn't like the format of it. The story is told mainly via video cameras.I Picked this movie out of hulu to watch before I went to bed and wish I had read reviews first.At the very least, for the audience, it could had concluded better or with finding the freak. I understand that finding such twisted perverted stalkers who murder their victims don't always get caught in reality and probably most don't.Was it realistic? Too realistic and not entertaining.The only merit for this film would be to put some fear and maybe sense into some wild and misguided teen.",Megan Is Missing
69,karaokeralf,"Generalized and disturbing, but important.",10,3 July 2011,"Yes, I give this film a 10. Why?Because it does not tell the complete story of any particular abduction or disappearance. Because it finds a way to leave a lasting imprint in your mind, and not one you relish. Because it deals with a very relevant issue that all parents and kids alike need to address.I have no need to share any spoilers, previous reviewers have shared enough. I only want to help more people find this film, watch it and share it. The theme is timely and important.Children everywhere are jumping into the social networking realm everyday through their computers and the internet as well as their cell phones. This lifestyle is no longer limited to college age and high school kids. Parents are purchasing cell phones for their adolescent and even younger children. Computers are now a staple of education, even in grade school.To parents: The line between your child's privacy and your obligation to care for their safety and well being is a fine line, but without creating a mutual gray area, your child can quite easily be victimized in any number of ways, sometimes culminating with an end result not much different from that of this film.For those of you criticizing the acting in this film, or the cinematography, writing, editing, small budget and 8-day shooting schedule, you're missing the point. The main girls in this film were portrayed as any girls attending your local school, or your neighbor, or even your own daughter. Many of you who think you know about that ""hidden"" part of their lives just because you can view their online profile are generally mistaken.I've seen a literally thousands lot of movies in my lifetime. I would not attempt to compare this to a blockbuster horror film or drama, or even to an Academy Award winning film for great screen writing or acting. But in the art of cinema, it does what it sets out to do: grab your full attention, burn an image in your mind that you can never let go, and actually learn something if you open your mind.For those of you who think the girls' characters are too one-dimensional and think daughters don't act like this, this is mostly true, but enough do for predators to feed on. Boys and girls alike, family life is different from their social life. They don't tell their parents everything, and as smart as some of them think they are, they still leave the evidence of their other life online.If you are prone to becoming ill from graphic depictions, think twice before viewing this film. It is one you don't want to miss, but be prepared for the consequences.In closing, I have to comment on a previous review. For a therapist to give this film a 3/10 and say it could've been so much better, I am shocked. Considering the impact it had on my wife and myself and so many others who have remarked how powerful this film was, I would definitely shop around for another therapist. Calling the last 22 minutes of this film boring leaves me to wonder if this therapist can feel anything at all. During that period, I felt slight nausea, empathy and anger. It was powerful enough to make me sit down and write a review. Don't dis the message in an attempt to share any self-proclaimed movie making skills.",Megan Is Missing

I mean seriously, that's over 200 kg of combined stuff to move!! Yes, that's what I'm stuck on.The rest of the movie was just boring and unrealistic.

71,brandonlewislaw,Great Movie,10,20 February 2012,"This is a great film. I seems weird, maybe insensitive, to say that but as a horror movie fan, I thought it was very good. Very creepy film, it gives you that 'sense of doom' feeling, knowing (because of the title) that Megan will be abducted at some point. I had no idea it would end the way it did, and I applaud the director for not backing off. This is a figurative slap in the face of the audience. A good slap. This is a REAL issue. These things DO happen. I'm a college student, far from a parent, but a parent telling their child not to do something usually falls on deaf ears. It's the ""this can't happen to me"" thing. I see people on this website saying they would never show this to their child as it is too disturbing. I'd say it is not quite as disturbing as your child being abducted because they are naive to the fact that the world is indeed a very ugly place at times. If it offends, shocks, disgusts, or lingers with you, or more importantly you child...it worked.*One criticism- The director has described this as well meaning and a cautionary tale. I agree. HOWEVER, the problem is with the last 20 minutes. The footage on its own is great, it defines the film and the brutal reality of the internet world. It is, however, unnecessary to say the last 20 minutes are REAL footage. That is just silly and contradicts the director's stance (not to mention, anyone with a brain or over the age of 12 knows it is just a movie). This made the movie veer into Blair Witch territory. The movie would have been just fine presenting itself as simply a movie, nothing more (if the director wanted to just present a cautionary tale)..The idea to call the ending real footage makes me question the director's sincerity, bordering on exploitation and shock value. If you are one of the easily offended, THIS is the only thing that should offend you.",Megan Is Missing

The director, Michael Goi claimed to have researched the case and used actual ""computer files"" to reconstruct the scenes.Everything about this movie is terrible, the writing, the acting, the directing, even the lighting.The actors stare directly into the camera all the time, and talk to it. When they have scenes together, there were supposedly Skyping, and the screen was split, again showing them talking to the camera. Aside from the oddness of having the actors talking to the camera instead of each other, teens don't Skype, they text.

73,efreed09,Don't discount the negative reviews,3,7 November 2021,"Having watched a ""top 10"" video for ""Most Disturbing Horror Movies"" and hearing this movie mentioned, it piqued my curiosity. I found the reviews very mixed. I generally discard any ratings at either extreme, and focus more on 3-4 for negative, and 5-7 for positive.I chose to take my chances, and watch it anyways, even having heard the multitude of negative reviews that for the most part had similar complaints.Chief among these is can be summarized: It is a boring look into the life of a couple teenagers engaging in high-risk behavior and vulgar conversation. I am unsure who this would appeal to, but it is very much not titillating, and more cringe. This is the first 44 minutes.Then comes the ""abduction"". Faux clips of some news segments and some absolutely immersion-killing ""Missing Persons"" show that is so poorly produced it is laughable. This goes on for about another 20-something minutes.Finally we have the ""22 minutes"", which is the ""horror"" section of film. There is indeed a few very disturbing portions, but to ininuate it is 22 minutes long is misleading. Half of this time-frame is watching the faceless assailant dig a hole.TLDR: While there is some extremely brief ""disturbing"" shots that live up to the hype, they in no way make it watchable, or redeem the slog that is the first 80% and last 10% of the movie. If you saw a brief clip to make you curious, then you have already seen half of the film's climax.",Megan Is Missing

75,slavabregovic,"Sad, realistic, better than you'd expect",6,12 June 2019,"I'm not sure why this movie got such terrible reviews (although the level of sinister depravity that it reaches could obviously be off-putting to some). There's some technical issues (swore I saw a mic in one scene), but otherwise I think the pastiche of camera/""youtube"" style video/cell phone footage works well for this particular story, and I typically don't care for ""found footage"" films.
A pro critic mentioned he found the main character unsympathetic and that she needed to be ""knocked off her pedestal"". I didn't get this impression, because I felt the actress really came across naturally. Teenagers are bratty and even the nicest have an annoying sense of entitlement---that's an important element in the realism of this story.
Megan is funny and charming, but has also incurred a lot of trauma in her short life. When describing her first sexual experience...you can't NOT feel sympathetic for her. It's a profoundly uncomfortable scene. This movie delves into some areas that are quite blunt (yet not heavy handed) and disturbing---yet they are things that happen all the time. People forget, or want to forget, that some teenagers have much more complicated lives than we'd think, and often they don't know who to turn to. Megan is an honor student, but the flip side of her life is much darker.
This starts off a little slow, and the dialogue is a lot of bland, typical kid chatter. It's a bit much but it sets the tone, and the cloud of naivety sets you up for a serious kick in the head as Megan's (and Amy's) lives unravel down to the bone.
This is definitely a harsh psychological horror film, I'm surprised it doesn't receive more recognition. There's a bit of black humor, satire and social commentary during the ""news report"" bits that are biting and clever.
I knocked off a few stars mostly because the antagonist has a frustratingly wooden delivery, which is disappointing as he's such a vital part of the story.
Overall though, worth checking out, and effectively unsettling.",Megan Is Missing

I wish I would've never watched this movie. So why am I giving it a 10/10?
Because I, for myself, have never seen an ending like that. Disturbing or not, I kind of love such stuff (don't come at me) and also, it was so emotional. It's tough to watch. A comment says don't watch it until you're 18 - well, I am 26. But - DONT watch that movie. I can't stop thinking about it and I don't want anyone else to feel the emotions I did/do. No happy ending.

The writer/director has a clear insight into the minds of teenagers and the way things work in that world. Some of the scenes in this film, and the emotions conveyed could have been plucked right out of my own childhood. When the kidnapping occurs, the atmosphere of the movie becomes grim.

From the Technical aspects to the dialogue this film is poor across the board. At times the acting is laughable, which takes you out of the seriousness of the subject, in fact the overall poor execution of this film detracts from the message, and its difficult for me to take this film seriously as it is so poor. It was a chore to sit through and I felt each of the 85 minute running time. This subject was covered much more sufficiently in another far superior film released in the same year called ""Trust"". I honestly found ""Trust"" more disturbing than this as I was actually into the story and character's, that film also managed to accomplish this without showing any explicit imagery. It just goes to show that shocking imagery an subject matter alone do not necessarily equal a disturbing film, and that quality execution and an engaging story are needed to make a film truly unsettling and memorable.",Megan Is Missing
82,kitcolfort,Emotionally Disturbing,6,17 November 2020,"Let me preface this by saying that my initial interest in the film came after it started trending on Twitter a few days ago, and so I'd already seen, and knew, about the content of the film, and had received a few warnings going in. That being said, I found that, none the less, the movie still disturbed me.Firstly, the first twenty or so minutes, before Megan goes missing, are boring and not a lot happens. There's some cringy dialogue that doesn't really feel natural, and the acting is subpar. It seems like the writer wasn't entirely sure how 13/14 year old's really acted, and so we're left with stiff performances and dialogue that seems like it's trying too hard. Given the fact that we're meant to believe that these characters are so young, the majority of their characterization just seems much older.Along with the poor acting (which, not a whole lot the actresses could have done with the script given), there's also our villain, who, like Megan and Amy, is stiff and unrealistic.Overall, the most interesting parts of the film happen in the last twenty minutes after Amy is abducted as well, but even then, interesting isn't really the word. These are the scariest parts of the movie. It unnerves you, the reality of what is going on, the infamous barrel scene.The movie ISN'T bad, if you can get past the dialogue, at least, not the last twenty minutes. Honestly, it makes the whole movie. Is it as scary as everyone hyped it up to be? No. Is it disturbing? Yes, in a different way.

I was expecting a Lifetime style drama about how talking to strangers on the internet is bad. What I got however was a found footage style thriller/horror film. It opens by explaining this is based on true events and then goes on to portray the footage as ""real"". You are told from the beginning when the girls go missing. The majority of the film is spent following the very stereotypical girls doing cliché teenage stuff. The acting goes back and forth from being painfully believable and just feeling really forced. After Megan's disappearance the creepy element really starts to kick in. There is one scene where Amy is sitting under a bridge with a teddy bear. While she is explaining why she keeps it there, a figure appears in the background behind some bushes. It is a very simple thing, but the way it was done creeped me out. From here on the movie takes a turn for the very dark and disturbing in a way that I wish I had been warned ahead of time about.

89,stitchesaresore,Beware the evil interwebs!,1,24 March 2015,"I've put off watching this one for quite a while because a.) I'm not huge on the found footage trend and b.) Megan is Missing looked pretty badly made. But as an active member of several horror communities, I kept seeing this movie pop up with comments about ""a very realistic portrayal of teenagers"" and ""the last 22 minutes are so disturbing"". After seeing enough people say that they'll never get over the ending, I finally decided it was time to see for myself. As the movie starts, we're already greeted with some terrible acting. Some text shows up on screen informing us that everything viewed here is taken from news clips and the girls' cameras, video chats, and cell phones. So they try to play this out like a sort of documentary. Let's keep in mind this is supposed to be in 2007, yet everyone is walking around video chatting 24/7 on their super awesome cell phones. We're introduced to Amy, a shy outcast virgin from a good family, and Megan, a popular sexually active girl with a rough home life. Nobody likes Amy, but Megan is able to get her into a party by trading favors with the jerk host. After attending the party where everyone is drinking and using drugs (complete with Amy walking in on Megan pleasuring the host, being hit by an overly touchy party goer, and getting sick in a terribly embarrassing way), Megan and Amy video chat. Megan goes into detail about her first blow job -- which was totally rape, BTW -- and gets busted by her mum, which leads to talks about running away.Later Megan starts chatting with some dude who calls himself ""Josh"" that her friend told her about. She's seen a picture of him, but his webcam is broken. They agree to meet up, but she doesn't see him. She finds out he was too shy, but decide to meet up again. The next morning, Amy starts video calling Megan's other friends (because who actually sends texts or makes phone calls), much to their annoyance. Everyone gets mad at Amy for Megan's disappearance after the girl reports Megan's talks with Josh to the police. He contacts her from a new ID and threatens her. This does not stop Amy from going alone to make a video diary under a bridge and she is kidnapped. For some reason, Josh decides to record things with Amy's camera and then he just tosses it out where it can be found. We're shown the uncut 22 minutes he recorded of Amy in captivity. He forces her to eat without her hands and later rapes her. She keeps her bra and knickers on during all of this and the rape remains focused only her face, though we see his bloody fingers to remind us that she was a virgin. The last moments of the film go on far too long of showing him digging a grave while Amy begs for her life the entire time. (During this scene you can see the shadows of other people around.) He then buries her alive.The entire thing serves as a ""don't talk to strangers online!"" warning. This is why a lot of people found it disturbing because ""IT COULD HAPPEN"".

Yes, around two-thousand children are reported missing on a daily basis but only 115 a YEAR are actually abducted by people who do not know the child.To put this in perspective (which the director didn't do) that means out of the roughly 800,000 children reported missing every year in the US about 0,014% are actually abducted by strangers.So, if you put this misinformation and scaremongering on top of the fact that this movie is absolutely awful when it comes to editing, cinematography, script and acting... it makes for one TERRIBLE movie.Don't watch this junk.",Megan Is Missing

The beginning of the movie was a nice close-up into the lives of young teenage girls and the many things that they face at such a young age. To say that ""If you're a parent, trust me your teen doesn't act like this"" is being a little too over-confident. Far too often, people think that their child would never do such things as abuse drugs, have sex, or commit crimes, yet we see it in the news every single day. People want to say ""My child would never,"" and it's that kind of attitude that leaves us vulnerable to what 'could' happen. I hate to say it, but teens pick on virgins, it's actually common because peer pressure is very strong during a child's high school years, and some are actually more curious than others when it comes to sex, drinking, and drugs. I didn't grow to hate any of the characters, I honestly felt sorry for them because they felt the need to divulge in such activities to be accepted by their peers, and some do it because they don't have such a good home life. If you take a look at parents these days, you will see more problems than many care to realize. In this economy, both parents are having to work to get by, which leaves even the 'virginal' children at home to fend for themselves at such a confusing time in their lives, and this, just the parents who actually pay attention to their children. Then you have to think about the many who don't. As far as the film itself, it is very hard to do a movie like this and be able to draw the audience into it, so I thought the video usage was a great idea. My shock moment came when they put photo #1 up on the screen. It's very scary because it's very real. People will sit there and think that this only happens in movies, but it doesn't. There are many sites out there that keep photographs like this on display, and for some reason, many people seem to be drawn to the 'barely legal' girls. With the internet, the world right at our fingertips, pedophiles and sexual predators are victimizing children by the dozens. They are naive, and find themselves getting close to/trusting people that they don't even know. The events of such might not fit this movie exactly, but it CAN happen, it DOES happen, and it continues to happen each and every day.As far as teenagers playing these roles, I think that was a good idea as well. We see them even younger playing in horror movies such as The Exorcist, Poltergeist, etc, yet we don't want to put them in movies that are there to help educate and make parents more aware of the dangers out there? That makes no sense to me. Many movies like this have affected me in such a way. To name a few-Bastard Out of Carolina, An American Crime, and Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door. Movies like this open our eyes, they make us see what is out there, what can and will happen if we aren't facing it head on. I got a little frustrated towards the end. I felt it dragged a bit much for my taste, but then I had to sit back and imagine myself in that situation. It makes you wonder what you would be willing to do/say if that young girl were you, so I eventually grew to like it. To sum up my review:Is this the best movie out there? No, but again, it is very hard to do a movie such as this and be able to put everything into it that you need to in order to captivate your audience. Is it worth watching? Yes, and I would recommend it to anyone who thought about watching it.",Megan Is Missing

But the acting wasn't all that good. But at the last 30 minutes the acting was suddenly amazing. Amy acted perfectly at the end. But the first part, I didn't understand. What did the party and drugs have to do with any of the movie? I thought it would've been them on video chat the whole time. Like calling a whole bunch of friends then seeing this weirdo, that's how I thought it would be. But the movie is really good.

95,hburji,Where less is more in the found footage context *works*.,8,26 July 2017,"I'll write this review in the same fashion as the film: less is more.I literally just finished watching this film. Definitely VERY unsettling.A found footage production that really keeps things simple.Initially I thought the acting was terrible, but as the film went on, I realised the acting is perfect for the roles and the story - NOT polished, and quite raw, which in fact, is how teenagers are as people at their stage of maturation: unbalanced, unpredictable, and not great at articulation. These traits are reflected in the acting.The first half of the film is the build up of the characters. But then things change very abruptly. By this point, I kinda felt like I was not watching a film, but a documentary. And I felt horrified.I too had to turn away at one point. After watching it, I'm gonna look for something light hearted to follow up with. I don't think I blinked for the second half of the film.﻿ What Megan Is Missing illustrates so clearly is just how easily these kinds of events can take place in today's world. Why parents need to be vigilant with their children, and why children too need to be educated STRONGLY about keeping safe.The internet has evolved a lot since this film was made, only 6 years ago, and scenarios like the one that takes place in this story are probably even more likely to happen now.I've seen some reviews and comments around suggest that this should be viewed by students in high schools. I'm starting to think this might not be a bad idea.Nothing in the film is glamourised and polished to any degree. And given how the film ends, neither is the story. The whole of this story and how it is expressed is done raw, and straight to the point.Michael Goi has received a lot of criticism for this film. But I disagree - I feel this film hits the nail right on the head. Having so many overdone films around us these day, Megan Is Missing felt like a breath of fresh air.Now, I need to find something fun to watch to shake some of the imagery and events of Megan Is Missing out of my head.",Megan Is Missing

I wanted to watch something I hadn't already seen and my favorite type of movies are mysteries/thrillers. I hadn't heard of it before seeing listed on Amazon Instant Video. I watched the trailer and thought ""okay, I'm game."" A kidnapping movie. Looked low budget but sometimes those can end up great? I had a hard time grading it because it did seem somewhat amateur but then again it really captures you and you feel the anguish. You realize early on that they're not the greatest actors (but they weren't horrible either). Could be really good given more experience. So, the movie mostly has the feel of a video recording or web chats. The story is extremely believable and utterly tragic. This is not a movie for innocent eyes. And if you're someone who has nightmares from something that seems realistic.. don't watch it. This is not a typical ""horror"" flick, nor is it a typical ""drama"". The situation is very real. I recommend that you most definitely watch the trailer first. If you like mystery/thriller movies, you may like it... but it does have an element of horror. If you watch horror movies because they don't seem realistic, well this movie is different. Overall, a good movie. Interesting but not necessarily entertaining.

98,crazzzik,The scariest drama among all horror movies,8,5 May 2011,"8 1/2 days of work will keep you sleepless for weeks.The movie does a great job showing lives of two young, somewhat spoiled teens as well as turning into a gruesome depiction of horrors of child kidnapping. The acting is good for a non-Hollywood actors and looks presentable overall. Even thou there is not a single picture or footage from real cases, it remains believable throughout the movie and beyond. The message is incredibly clear, you'll know.I would not recommend this movie to anyone who have not seen death or struggle in real life to compare to. Final 22 minutes of the movie will stick to the walls of your brain without ability to scrape it off. Think well before seeing this movie, because you will not be able to ""unsee"" it. For those who compare it to something like Saw, Hostel, Silence of the Lambs or another horror Hollywood movie, you can't. The difference is that this one is done to believe in actions that happened in the movie. You will have a strong feeling that it actually happened. Don't let the genre trick you, it is more of a horror than a drama.I would not recommend to watch this movie if you want to play on your nerves. Please see it for awareness sake ONLY.Bottom line: It is well done movie made to raise awareness of internet predators and child kidnapping. If you dare to watch it, prepare to get shocked.And keep your kids safe!",Megan Is Missing
99,asumpter66,A bit over-done but effective ***Possible Spoiler***,7,24 January 2012,"I really hated this movie. The acting was horrible for the most part and it took me 24 hours to get through the last 10 minutes. My preferred horror story is along the lines of Hostel and Saw... senseless and gory and ""unbelievably"" violent. When a movie rubs up against a truly possible reality it makes me sick.Personal feelings aside I rated this a 7. In spite of the crappy acting the main characters were well thought out and the storyline itself moved along decently. Megans background was crafted to reflect the, sadly, typical childhood and home-life that leads young girls to be open to forming friendships with people they know nothing about. Unfortunately once the news clips started rolling I lost the sense of realism. According to the Principal and friends that were interviewed Megan was an ""A"" student and a real community asset. What?! Not likely. Victims of child-abuse rarely spend their teen years being ""joiners"" and role-models. Judging from the group of friends Megan had and the life-style they all participated in, not one of those kids was anything close to a community asset.The finale, while ultimately sickening, was over-done. I appreciate the effect of letting my mind show me what the camera wasn't. The images I have produced will stay with me forever and I can't scrub them away. The brick underground cell along with the collar and chains was a little over-the-top for me. It just seemed too standard. The hijacking of Billy and using it to torture Amy was a nice touch though. All the digging and Amy's voice rambling non-stop was also very effective. Once the killer was finished though he turns and walks away into the encroaching daylight?? So he was outside? All that screaming and crying was done outside? That knocked the reality out of it for me. Who is going to do that outside? I was left with a feeling of non-belief.Internet stalking is a very real terror and I applaud the makers of this film for tackling the task. The movie left me ill and wanting to scrape my brain clean.",Megan Is Missing
100,kgosi95,A very poor effort! I am literally lost for words!,1,20 August 2013,"In brief, ""Megan is Missing"" follows the everyday lives of two naïve teenage girls who fall victim to the dangers of the internet. This is literally the best summary, I could give without the spoiling the film, which is unfortunately not a very good one. One of the major problems that I have with this film is the portrayal of teenagers. There are essentially two main characters here, the innocent and disliked Amy and her promiscuous, best friend Megan. The director, Michael Goi, himself, expressed the intention of projecting a film that tackles the real issues but the problem is that the characters' aren't real. Megan and Amy have such an unlikely friendship and they have such extreme personalities that it's difficult to care or even remotely believe what you are seeing. Secondly, the film barely has any plot and for the most part just depicts conversations between the two main characters. As a result, I found this quite dull and uninteresting. The quality of the movie is also very poor. I understand that the film is of the found footage genre but when one is able to hear the director shouting action at the beginning of a scene you know something's wrong here. I make no exaggeration when I saw this is one of the worst acted, worst edited and worst written pictures I have had the displeasure of seeing.",Megan Is Missing
101,jarch020,Creepy and disturbing,1,30 March 2013,"This movie had originally looked like a good laugh, but it was truly quite the opposite. The apparent goal of the movie is to warn teenagers and parents about the dangers of the internet, however from what I could tell, the movie was *actually* made to act out some disgusting, disturbing fetishes.My first problem with the movie is that it exploits these teenagers. The 13 year old girl is discussing giving head at the age of 10. Not only does she say it happened, but she goes into about 10 minutes worth of detail. It was at this point in the movie that I began to question the director's intentions with the movie, and believe me, it got worse.The end of the movie features 22 minutes of ""uncut footage"" wherein we watch: - the 14 year old girl (Amy) chained to a wall in a dungeon - Amy being forced to eat out of a bowl like a dog - Amy being brutally raped (yes, the entire thing - blood and everything) - Amy being shown her best friend Megan's dead body which is sitting up in a barrel - Amy being put in the barrel with her best friend's dead body and banging to be let out - ""josh"" digging a hole, which is literally a 10 minute scene where he digs as Amy screams from inside the barrel - finally josh buries Amy alive with her best friend's bodyNow usually I am not offended by gory, disturbing scenes. In fact, sometimes they definitely help portray a message. In this case, however, the last 22 minutes were UNBELIEVABLY unnecessary, and simply horrifying to watch.

It is a very excellent film for anyone who is too trusting and is a great example of why you should never talk to strangers online. The first 30 minutes or so of the movie takes place mostly on a web cam and video chats between the two main characters. It isn't until Megan meets ""Josh"" online that things start getting intense. I do not recommend this movie for anyone under the age of 17. There are several very disturbing parts involving a girl being chained to a wall by her neck, being forced to eat like a dog, a rape scene, a burial while the girl is still alive, and very gruesome images with a sudden glance at a decomposed body. I only wish this film was not as gruesome so my 13 year old sister could watch in hopes of her never talking to any online strangers. Rest in peace Megan and Amy.",Megan Is Missing

Maybe it's just me, I don't know. Obviously the footage in this movie is not at all real. But it gave me the worst feeling during some parts, ex. the last 22 minutes, the pictures from the ""bulletin board"" and a few random parts throughout the movie. I don't think I even looked at the screen for the last little bit where he starts digging her grave. I actually wanted to turn it off but didn't want to go near the screen and see it. The movie itself wasn't that great, at all... I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really, unless you want to watch some sick things. but it definitely freaked me out quite a bit.

104,rattlehead_1987,Megan is missing,8,25 February 2014,"------------------- This contains spoilers! -----------------------This movie came my attention while searching for interesting horror titles that aren't gore. At first i have to say about the teens in this movie, they're as real as you can get, i have worked as a guard at malls, and also as a security on festivals, bars etc. I have seen a lot of teens, especially at festival, girls and guys aged 15 =>. And yes, they really act like this, summertime, it's not rare to see a drunk teenager at parks on the evenings having fun. And this is at Finland, where people do go to the parks with alcohol, if you're underage and caught, police will take the alcohol of course (IF you're caught). Over 18yo people can just sit at a park, talk and drink as long as they behave, there's not fines or anything. I don't know how this is at other countries. The home parties i was at that age, yes, i got bj's, and so did other guys, so nothing strange in that either. It was pretty basic. But drugs weren't there on my days, tho i know they have been getting more and more used these days, especially pot. And i wasn't even near the wildest kid back then.Now that i have said that, i hope you people who say the teens are overacted, start thinking how really young girls behave, you'll see this movie what it's supposed to be, i understand they annoy. They do that in real life too, they are stupid, talk trash, act slutty. Not all of them, but some girls.The chemistry between these two girls were amazing! They were complete opposites, but still enjoyed each other company, sure Megan was into boys, but she still liked Amy's company, which is totally believable? If you enjoy sex, it doesn't mean you are rude/not a good friend as a human being. Amy was also a shy girl, so it wouldn't have been easy for her to leave Megan. They grew in me as the movie progressed, i didn't really pity Megan until i saw the pictures. My mind started racing: - What in the name of god he put Megan trough? For how long? - How much she must have suffered, feared and felt hopeless.These were the things that really affected me, and made this movie pretty menacing. The things the movie didn't show, but things that must have happened (beating, more humiliation), i felt sick, disgusted.Then the 22 minute horror fest. Now Amy was a sweet girl, her rape was so wrong on so many levels it really made me angry, sad, disgusted, made me want to hunt down every pedophile and make them suffer.Then came the ending when she was buried alive with her dead friend in a barrel. I have this bad habit that i really get into movies, i think too much, i thought how long she would be screaming, trying to get out, how hopeless she feels, how scared she is.This movie was great in my opinion, teens were realistic, they act annoyingly, they act slutty to get attention from boys, guess it makes some girls feel good about themselves to be noticed. Go to the mall, listen teens talk, they do talk about sex, we did it, between boys and girls, i know girls did it, i saw some sms messages, i heard things. The teens in this movie, is the most realistic portrayal i have seen in a horror movie.I also understands how it annoys people, it annoys me too, but that's how some teen's are, especially girls. Boys are full of themselves, acting like they're invincible. To adult's most teens seem stupid and annoying, that's a fact, not to blame the movie about having annoying teens as a character. Accept that, and you guys will see how this movie should have been seen. Brutal, very realistic movie (expect the part where Amy just wanders after getting threatened), provoking, haunting film.8/10",Megan Is Missing
105,notreadytorun,"Good Message, Bad Presentaion. Unexpected and Disturbing.",2,30 December 2013,"The acting was mediocre. It wasn't absolutely terrible, but it wasn't great either. The girls who are supposedly 13 and 14 look like they are at least 18, and probably closer to somewhere in their early 20s.Spreading the word about situations like this can be a good thing. However, the presentation was horrible. Trying to make a movie geared towards teens as a cautionary film, yet making it into something like this is just ridiculous.The beginning of the movie starts seemingly harmless. Other than loads of foul language, I thought it was going to be some lame teen drama with maybe a small dash of suspense thrown in as something to save the plot. Boy, was I wrong.I knew what I was getting into regarding the general theme of the movie, and what the plot stated, but the plot and synopsis that you can find do not even mention the disturbing nature of the rest of the film.Once it gets to about the middle of the movie, you're done. You are scarred for life, no going back. When I saw the two ""pictures"" of Megan, I could not do it. I was so disgusted and disturbed. This is where my heart started racing and I began shaking.I cannot understand why you would present a subject in this manner. That was just disgusting and disturbing. To me, the pictures felt so sudden that they were used as a shock factor. The ending was too much, and made you wonder what the director was thinking, seeing how this is a girl who just turned 14. I was left shaking for about three hours after I finished the movie because I was so shocked from these scenes.The last ten minutes were just the digging and burying. A very disappointing and dragged out ending. I fast forwarded through most of it to see what else was left. This was just a bad way to wrap up the movie. Using something so lengthy and redundant was not a good choice.Overall, it was a terrible movie with less than impressing acting, and it will leave people disturbed if they don't expect the things to come.",Megan Is Missing

116,tutusandtrainwrecks,"If understood, fantastic",9,29 November 2011,"I am personally finding Megan Is Missing a tough one to review. Its tasteless, grotesque, low budget and difficult to watch. Is it a well made movie? No. Is it an important movie? Absolutely. I initially watched MIM because I had heard it was the kind of film that burned itself into your eyelids for weeks after you had turned off your television in horror. It was defiantly one of those films.The first hour of the film was kind of dull if I am totally honest. The acting was lame and so was the unbelievable storyline that was littered with plot-flaws and holes. It was the usual kind of warped stereotypical view of a ""bad"" teenagers life (drugs, drink, underage sex) and her placid, goody two shoes best friend. The two main characters lacked common sense and believability as they chatted to a young man named ""Josh"" online.However, all of a sudden, I found myself watching the infamous ""Last 22 minutes"" and from that moment on, I was glued to my screen. Obviously, Josh was not a young boy at all, he was an internet predator. It started off with a blood curdling collection of photographs showing main character Megan (only 13 years old) tied up and being tortured in bondage devices that would put most fetish sites to shame. After this, the film throws child rape, torture, and a situation so terrifying it would be enough to put you off chat lines for life in the viewers direction. The final scene, showing Amy desperately begging for her life, will tug on your heartstrings and leave you realising how much empathy the film has created for its unfortunate characters.Honestly, I think I cried after I watched this film. It hit me hard because as a female, I empathised with Amy and Megan so much that I began to feel like they were real girls, who's suffering I had just witnessed.I rated this movie so highly because it left me reeling for weeks, it left me scared to speak to any of my ""internet friends"" and it has stuck with me right to this day. I like this film because it shows a very real danger that is often sugar coated by people, it's a movie that could very easily (and already has) become a chilling reality for some misfortunate girls.All I can say is that this film deserves to be recognised for what it is; a brutally REALISTIC account of what can happen to young girls (and boys) who don't take care on the internet.",Megan Is Missing

I know better when to not meet a complete stranger. Weeks later, her friend Amy (Just had a birthday in the film) got kidnapped too! I understand Amy being kidnapped because she didn't meet Josh. She was filming her vlog videos and she got kidnapped on camera. This film was boring the first hour, I'm not going to lie because it was dialogue heavy and no intense scenes. About the last half hour it got interesting because it was disturbing. When ""Josh"" released the photos on the Internet of Megan made me have chills because she was in a place like it was Saw. (Chained down with mouth wide open) Also the scene where Amy is screaming ""Help Me"" and no one helps her. The three minute rape scene creepy because any sort of rape in a film is awkward to watch because it is graphic. The blood on his finger was gross.. The most intense scene of the whole film was when ""Josh"" takes Amy to a barrel and Megan is in the barrel dead and Josh crams her in the barrel and buries her alive and all you hear is Amy crying help me.. That's my review for Megan Is Missing. If You like disturbing films, this is a must watch! 5/10",Megan Is Missing
118,im_a_werewolf,bad acting!,3,12 July 2013,"This story follows Amy and Megan,two besties that share a weird relationship.This movie is filmed like paranormal activity,but with cameras,phones,and computers.I give this movie three stars because this has really bad acting and really clichéd events.Like for instance,a boy on the internet,without a video camera talking to Megan though the internet.And him asking her to meet behind a abandoned diner.....which leads to Megan's disappearance to school the next day,then the next day,then never.Amy goes to ask Megan's friends that are,you know,hoes.They don't know were she is ,then blames it on Amy.And the one who's yelling at her,is the one that introduced josh(the no camera on the web guy)to Megan.Amy starts to talk to josh about Megan's disappearance,and he tells her to forget about it,then he freaking kid naps Amy,rapes her,and puts her in a bucket,where,wait for it.......includes her best friend's,Megan's,dead body.He is so stupid,because all this time,he records it on Amy,s video camera.The PO-PO finds it and a couple photos of Megan being tortured.They movie people called it completely true,but i call bull crap.",Megan Is Missing
119,Christopheratkky,Not for the faint of heart,6,26 May 2015,"This movie caught me off guard big time. For months I had been searching horror movie lists and always passed 'Megan is Missing'. Going by the title and cover alone it seemed like the poor quality ""watch out for online predator"" documentaries that you would watch every year in school. For the first hour or so this holds true, although the first hour is still too adult for anyway not 17+. It has mediocre writing and acting, and due to it being a found footage movie you can't expect too much from the camera. However, it's the last 20 minutes that are stomach-wrenching and heart-crushingly disturbing. It's known very early on in the movie that the protagonist, Amy, and her best friend Megan do not have a happy ending, but until you get through the last 20 minutes you can't fathom just how unhappy it is. Megan is kidnapped first by a man named 'Josh' that she had been talking to online. While the audience only sees footage of what happens to Amy, it can be presumed by photographs shown that the exact same thing happened to Megan. To put it bluntly both girls are brutally degraded and raped by Josh before being buried alive in barrel. Since Megan was kidnapped weeks earlier, the barrel Amy is forced into already has her friends corpse in it. The final 10 minutes before the credits role is the man digging a whole while you hear Amy pleading for her life inside of the barrel... to no avail. Yes, it really is that disturbing. I've always considered myself tough when it came to horror movies, to such an extent that I can fall asleep to them if I'm tired enough without having a nightmare. 'Megan is Missing' was too much for me to just 'shake-off' like I usually do with horror movies. All in all this movie does serve as a grim reminder that these things do happen in reality. Unless you're a seasoned horror movie watcher I would advise you to not watch this at all, or if you do to watch it with someone you feel incredibly safe with.",Megan Is Missing
120,fluffywolfthesecond,Well...,6,8 February 2015,If you want to watch a film that you may find upsetting then this is the film for you. I honestly don't know how I sat through one of the scenes. It is a good horror film but can be hard to watch. Not much happens but the things that do happen are shocking and I believe it is worth watching the film due to the shocking nature. The beginning is a bit far fetched as i don't think anyone of the girls age would do the things the girls do in the beginning of the film. I give this film 6 stars because i'm not sure it should of been that graphic but i did enjoy it. If you watch this then be prepared for a graphic scene.,Megan Is Missing
121,benjaminborrelli,The only thing disturbing about this horror flick is that it was made.,1,26 October 2015,"To put it in simple terms, it's seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen It features some of the worst directing, acting, cinematography, logic and pretty much anything you can think of that is vital to the production of a movie. I can not take anyone seriously if they say they enjoyed this movie.Don't get me wrong, I get what they were aiming for, but they did it in the most illogical and unrealistic piece of s*** way possible! It's almost like Michael Goi doesn't know a single thing about the internet or teenagers in general, but we see him on reddit and IMDb all the time? Good Job Goi! (Who elected this guy president of the ASC?

122,ktktravers,Not as bad as I've heard,6,22 June 2016,"I think people are being a bit overreactionary and unfair with the one star ratings. Yeah, this was low budget and the script could have been better. I thought the dialogue was a little annoying and vapid but honestly, I remember a lot of my teenager talks being on the shallow side, so maybe it's an accurate portrayal. But even though it looked a bit amateur, overall I thought it did a fair-to-good job for what it set out to do while still being entertaining. The director was up front in saying he aimed to make this a warning about online predators. Given the subject matter, this could easily have been exploitative + gratuitous. I think it refrained from doing that, so kudos. I really don't agree with those who have said the ""warning"" theme to the movie is just an excuse to show the raping of a fourteen year old. That scene focuses only on Amy's face the entire time, and the only viewer who would see that as exciting or as anything other than heartbreaking and angering is a sociopath already, and there are many other, sicker films that they would probably ""enjoy"" (blech) instead of this one. That said, the movie still banks highly on suspense and cultural morbid curiosity about predators, kidnapping, sexual assault and other violence. I don't like torture porn movies, but this one is based on true accounts,(actual pictures and footage were part of the research) and I thought it important to really get a glimpse into what those victims went through. While I thought the characters a bit shallow, (and FTR I think a lot of teenagers IRL are kind of shallow) there was decent enough backstory and character development to make me care about them. As has been said by many already, the last twenty minutes are really sad and hard to watch, but it was pretty ingenious-- for instance, showing the complete last moments of Amy's life instead of abbreviating it or cutting to different scenes. Some people have complained about how tedious it was, but this wasn't meant to be an action movie. It showed what an eternal agony Amy felt. And the very last scene is just totally heartbreaking.Deal with the cringe worthy moments. This movie is worth watching.",Megan Is Missing

It is one of the few films which I have watched and has stuck with me.I disagree with some of the reviews on here for saying it is unrealistic when a similar thing did actually happen in real life.There a two very shocking images which are shown on screen.

They couldn't even afford have a real actor for "" Josh!""Terrible acting, terrible quality, and it's disgusting.This movie is very gory and sexually explicit, in one scene it has Megan's best friend being led to a bucket thingy and then when ""Josh"" opens the bucket you see Megan's dead corpse inside!

126,bcsister,A disturbing account of what happens to thousands of teens every day.,10,1 August 2011,"This film IS based on true accounts. Read the message from the director on the official website to learn what real cases he's portraying. There is not one scene in this movie made up. The dialogue and interaction of the teens in this film is shockingly real, though many will refuse to believe it. Reminiscent of Larry Clark's ""Kds"" (1995), Rafal Zielinski's ""Fun"" (1994), and Catherine Hardwicke's ""Thirteen"" (2003), the teens in this movie are brilliantly portrayed as rough, juvenile, and stark. Every adolescent is until true esteem & character are fully formed in adulthood. This movie IS a drama. Even so, the nightmare began when it sank in just how easily young girls can be deceived. Megan is first interested in Josh after a friend sent her his picture, and she decides to video chat with him. HIS camera is broken, so he can't be seen live.After a few flirty challenges are exchanged, she decides to meet him in a public place... she thinks he's a no show. After another conversation where he explains that he WAS there, just couldn't face her, she believes he is just shy, and isn't angry anymore.Another conversation where she ""introduces"" Josh to her best friend, only she has yet to talk to him ""face to face"" due to his lack of video feed. She agrees to meet him again~ only this time behind a restaurant in an alley.Behavior like this seems unreasonable and utterly stupid. Some might think she should have seen through the ""broken camera"" excuses, or that no teen in this day would agree to meet a stranger in the alley.She is young, interested in boys, and relieved that he IS interested in her after all! They have had several conversations... she has no reason NOT to believe him! I have done this myself, in my 30's! Get a picture, have a few pleasant conversations, and agree to meet somewhere safe. The person I met was NOT the person I had expected to meet, either. Not at all!The deception becomes clear for Megan too late.There the fear and horror continues, as her friend tries to figure out what happened to Megan, not recognizing DANGER when she encounters it herself.The last 45 minutes of the movie is graphic. And disturbing. All the more unsettling because of the reality of the circumstances. I knew From the moment I saw Josh in the background that Amy was in danger. As soon as he takes the camera and starts shooting the film, I knew Amy was going to die a terrible, hopeless, painful death.I say Horror not because of gore, or because of bone-chilling music, nor the use of wonderful special effects. Nothing is going to suddenly jump out at you, the dead definitely do not walk, there are no furry sharp- toothed monsters. I do not say horror to mean the film's genre.I mean horror literally; the dense wave of fear that washed over me when I became undeniably aware of the intent of the mild-mannered, flirty guy on the other side of the computer screen.I say horror because the evil is very, very real. Advances in technology bring the predators into our homes, on our phones, and send them through text. Evil is sitting in a la-z-boy in his home office while his wife is cleaning up after dinner. And he is talking to YOUR daughter!Our kids are vulnerable, accessible. Evil can touch them. Evil can take them.Evil is trying right now.",Megan Is Missing

130,bladesman2,The most touching moment went neglected,3,14 October 2013,"A chilling burial in a shallow grave. An apt metaphor for where this director's career belongs. I can hear it now. ""But Hollywood, I love you. I'll do better. I promise not to make any more terrible movies. I'll do whatever you want. Just don't bury me."" It's like someone wondered what would happen if he tried to market The Blair Witch Project to teenage girls and, having somewhere near the end remembered what a wholly unsatisfying film that was, tried to use his last 25 minutes of runtime for something at least a little bit exciting. But apparently he didn't have many ideas, so implied rape and murder somehow had to fill up way more time than it needed.Depictions of helpless girls in distress is always disturbing. It gets balanced out a little by me not having much reason to give a (expletive removed) about either one of them though. Don't worry about character development. The director can add dimension to his creations by trying to lie to us about whether it's a true story or not. Based on actual events is the guise under which we can create empathy without having to write a character. As far as I can tell, the actual events being that sometimes people get kidnapped. And also vapid teens use Skype a lot. Probably. I don't know what the kids are into nowadays.We are told that we are about to see the ""Original security camera footage of Megan Stewart's abduction"". For a short while we're almost sucked into the story as we wonder if the director skilfully recreated this shot from police archives. Then we're left to be confused as to why we'd want to see it at 200% size. Then we're really confused by seeing it at 500%. It comes somewhere around the time we're watching bad TV recreations within a bad recreation. At least Goi can boast that his film had nearly as many artificial layers as Inception's dream world.I know, pretending it's real through narration is part of doing the ""found footage"" tropes. But it's cheaply done. Rather than build a suspension of disbelief through a world and its characters it's much easier just to lie in plain text on a black background. Create the idea that Megan is actually out there, and you can make me care about her fate, even if I couldn't care less about your representation of it. It's like if you spliced sad messages into Tom and Jerry. Based on actual events. Tom died two weeks later from frying pan inflicted injuries.Sure, hurting kittens is not only a real thing (animals chasing other animals in the real world presumably makes every Loony Tunes adventure based on a true story), but it's more or less the saddest thing in the world. Doesn't make Tom and Jerry a harrowing portrayal of animal abuse. Beat him with the broom again. See if I turn away in horror. What did I learn from this film? That 14 year old American honour students don't connect the dots between ""met a guy online"" and ""went missing"" until the kidnapper calls them fat. Even if given two weeks in between to think about it. Shame that at no point did the police think to ask her what her friend was doing on the night she disappeared. Or if they did, ""She went to meet a weird guy off the internet that neither of us have ever seen before"" didn't trigger alarm bells.And child murderers like to record in intimate detail their vile acts only to leave their twisted trophy lying in a bin for the bumbling officers to hopefully find. I wouldn't have backed them to find it. Especially since the police were reaching the conclusion that Megan had run away in spite of a video recording of her being forcefully abducted. If I can say something positive about the film it's that the two main actresses are generally well acted. Their relationship is organic and believable. Naturally, the hype of this film will lie in its infamous 22 minutes of suffering but the most memorable part to me will remain a section where they playfully enact a video interview, which leads to Megan spontaneously laying bare her history of sexual abuse. The speed with which she switches from talks of her happiness and aspirations to the victimhood that she seemingly believes defines her is all too poignant. It's a fleeting moment in which we gain insight into the motivations of a character in an otherwise disengaging mess.",Megan Is Missing

132,ashnburrell,Hard & disturbing watch but real,10,16 November 2020,"I saw a tik tok from Michael Goi talking about his 3 warnings for watching this movie, since it has gained some recent traction. I agree with a lot of others that the acting is meh, and most of the moving is slow burning to buildup to the final 20 minutes. Personally, the writing and slow buildup is important and makes it more realistic. It shows the backstory of an abused, young girl that seeking any form of attention (male, sexual, parental etc) and how predators use that to groom girls. Being groomed and preyed upon isn't necessarily a fast, impulsive decision like being picked up in a van off the street, it's similar to this. Personally, the slow beginning is disturbing in its own ways that ultimately led to such a traumatizing ending. I think a lot of people missed or weren't validating the grooming as the most important and horrific thing and focused on the gruesome fate of these young girls as the big pictures. Without understanding both parts of the movies and how important they are in this particular story, viewers will criticize the girls and their actions etc. This isn't a Hills Have Eyes style horror movie where the fate in inevitable, it's realistic to how young girls are targeted and groomed and just how ""boring"" or ""unexciting"" it appears to an audience.

Science says before you laugh your brain preps your face muscles but I didn't even feel the slightest twitch. 0/10 this joke is so bad I cannot believe anyone legally allowed you to be creative at all.

Honestly if I put in all my power and time to try and make your joke funny it would require Einstein himself to build a device to strap me into so I can be connected to the energy of a billion stars to do it, and even then all that joke would get from people is a subtle scuff.

From showing the initial ""wrong"" crowd scene, to girls with low self esteem (who may be more opt to talk to some strange people online or otherwise - or become adult dancers), to meeting a new person not in an open public place ....but behind a building or creek or some other such secluded, safe place (sarcasm).They then show some twisted content - when the girls are abducted, which undoubtedly does go down - rape, bondage, torture, etc. In this case the girls were killed/buried alive....they may have easily been transported to Mexico or wherever and became slaves/prostitutes.If you keep in mind what appears to be the intended audience/message of this film, I think it was pretty well.

But even though this isn't the film I thought it would be when i picked it up at my local video store, i was intrigued and mesmerized by what this movie's subject matter really dealt with. Sure, people are bashing on the film for it's content because it is, probably the most disturbing film ever made, but even so, I think that those involved in the making of this film weren't overall trying to make a buck out of a gruesome situation. I think they were passionate about getting the message out there to people who don't realize, THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN!!!! Sure not every online predator has the intentions that are shown in this film, but to all the haters out there wishing cruel things upon the crew and those involved in the making of this film, completely missed the point of this film. Simply put, believe it or not, there ARE people like the predator depicted in this film out there, and more than likely, a lot more than people realize. This movie truly moved me, and opened my eyes to a truth most of us are unaware of or even consider half the time: the true harshness's people can be capable of. 'Megan Is Missing' is the most real experience of evil, that even Hollywood hasn't been able to make a film worthy of comparison. I have never felt the feelings I felt while watching the last 22 minutes of this film, and I'm pretty positive I'll never forget them either. I award this film 10 stars out of 10 because 'Megan Is Missing is hands-down the most brutally honest, daring, and important film ever made, with a message that exceeds it's 80-some minute runtime. I believe everyone should see this film, even if you have a weak stomach. As harsh as this film is, it may just save someone's life.",Megan Is Missing

It's very well shot and the acting is pretty good for such young actresses. Especially if you consider the short time they filmed. But on the other hand the writing is... meh... The movie starts out with your classic Steven King setting of Everybody except the lead is an Asshole"" - this is bad because the world just isn't like this. The director states everything he wrote was based on real cases, dialog even on the real chatting of 13/14 year old girls. The problem is that he seems to have only milked the essence of immoral and evil behavior out of this and mixed it into a black whole of a movie. I bet there are girls that loose their virginity at 10 (or claim so), i bet there are 14 year old girls that to have sex, pay 10$ entrance fees to house parties with alcohol and drugs that are considered harder... but the way it is shown in this movie feels more like it's something all the hip 14 year olds do. To be honest, i felt a lot like the girls in this movie were acting a lot more like some 18/19 year olds (which i believe also is the age of the actresses) would. - Not that this could not happen to girls this age, but i do study with girls whom are starting between 18 and 21 and while there are alcohol and sex involved i can assure you that life indeed more than a drug and sex filled orgy. This will only get over protective parents to be more protective, all the other people will be like... Eh, why is he trying so hard to make everything look this crazy."" And there is more, just no one seems to be nice for some reason. Like the crazy mom e.g. After Megan goes missing there are a couple of News report segments that felt like a failed attempt of comic relief, making fun of the mass media and how the evil girl friends have a twisted view on things. It really feels a out of place in an otherwise very serious movie. The last 20 Minutes of the movie are very gruesome. The director states that he wants to show what otherwise only is talked about in News Reports for seconds, and that he dos not only want to hint at what is happening... all in all i believe this is a fair use of what is shown, and it is not easy to look at especially with what we have gotten to know about the girl. You might argue that it's a bit to over the top again here (i doubt most rapists are this evil in their extremely evil act) but since there is a psychopath involved and we all heard or read terrible stories on the news this still feels valid.All in all i think i would easily have given this movie three more stars if it had taken itself more serious in the first two acts (less, everybody is an a**, more serious portrait of the news reports). The whole feel would have been much more staggering because it would have felt more like it could be the girls next door.

Exploitative and nothing redeeming about it.Although it is supposedly be a film to send a strong message to parents, children, internet users, etc, it falls flat and is juvenile in it's attempt to do so. ""Megan is Missing"" equals nothing more than a B movie, shock schlock attempt at a low budget slasher type film.It is an insult to your intelligence, both artistically and intellectually. Right from the beginning, any viewer with a spoonful of brains will go, ""Hey, if this is based on real events and real internet history and junk, how come..."" and then you know it's gonna get worse as it goes along. The sad fact is, I kept watching to see ""just how low will they stoop to try and pass this off"" and be damned; they couldn't have stooped any lower if they were a cricket in the grass.What really is insulting about this film is that internet predators and abductions is a real issue in the world, as is exploitation of people on the internet. It is tragic, it is a growing problem, it's frightening, and yet some schmuck thinks it's a topic to be played with to make a chunk of change in their pocket and by doing so, negate the lives of those really exploited, harmed and killed by deranged individuals scouring chat rooms and social networks looking for their prey.

160,j-b-51-777891,"Just a very unrealistic, badly put together movie...",1,12 May 2011,"At the beginning of this movie we are told that it is based on a true story. I'd like to see that story as this movie seems like the most unrealistic depiction of an Internet predator case I've ever seen. I can recall watching a 10-minute awareness movie in high school that was more true to life.Don't get me wrong, I think that it is vital to stay informed, kids do get lured over the Internet, but the way this movie presents it is laughable.First of all, the characters are incredibly shallow clichés. The abused girl who values herself very little and thus engages in risky behavior including drinking, doing drugs and having indiscriminate sex. Her best friend is the cardboard cut-out of the good girl, and is picked on for being so.Both girls seem completely naive to the point where they should not be allowed to be online, let alone in chat rooms. While chatting with ""Josh"" they are almost oblivious to his contradictions (dog wrecked web cam/little brother wrecked web cam), his stalker-like behavior and his avoidance of showing himself on video or in person.Even more problematic in my viewing of the film is the way the kidnapping case was portrayed. If a minor like Amy came forward with evidence like she did, her identity should be kept a secret, as should the information she shared. There are reasons why certain information is not revealed in an investigation. Also, as Amy was one of the last people who saw Megan, she should have been questioned, and the information about ""Josh"" should have been discovered much sooner.Even after all of this, Amy is still chatting with ""Josh"" even when it becomes very apparent he is the kidnapper.Also, in a case like this, officials should be able to track ""Josh's"" location via his IP address.Also, ""Josh's"" profile as a criminal is very blurry. He seems to be intelligent in some cases, however, he makes some major mistakes in other cases. He is not a believable criminal, and were this movie reality, the police should have been able to track him down.This movie was just not up to par for either being an informative video or a ""scary movie."" It relied solely on the hype and fixation people unfortunately have on the idea of people being dramatically kidnapped by Internet predators. Skip this one.",Megan Is Missing

The creators of this movie, which were based on actual events by the way, were trying to educate viewers of todays predators and the ease of doing so using modern technology that many of the younger generation consider to be tame and innocuous. I agree that this is a tough film to watch especially if you have children that at teenagers or younger but it is also a call to arms for parents and responsible caring adults to take notice of their children's activities and know who their friends are and above all, to be involved in their children's lives. I wouldn't classify this movie as entertainment by any means nor did I find it enjoyable or a ""feel good movie"" to cuddle up with a loved one on a Saturday night but I would highly recommend it to any parent today.

162,fralligator,A Reminder of a Local Tragedy In My Home Town!!,10,27 May 2011,"Actually my heart sank when I read the description of the movie because there were some striking similarities to a tragic case that happened here in Portland Oregon. Another reviewer mentioned that the movie is supposed to be based on a true story but when they tried to research it they could not find anything that matched. If you read more carefully you will see it is based on a study of multiple cases which I am guessing means they used elements from different cases to create this story.Several years ago 2 teenage girls who were friends disappeared in Oregon City Oregon. Their names were Ashley Pond (almost 14 years old when she went missing) and Miranda Gaddis (14 years old when she vanished). They both lived in the same apartment complex on a dead end road. At the top of the road there was a house where a man named Ward Weaver lived with his daughter who was roughly the same age as Ashley and Miranda. The two girls became friends with Weaver's daughter. In August of 2001 Ashley accused Ward Weaver of attempting to rape her but the police did not investigate. In January of 2002 Ashley disappeared on her way to school. As in the movie - everyone searched for her including her friend Miranda - she was never found. Two months later Miranda vanished.As in the movie there was media coverage that speculated the girls ran away. There was talk that one girl had a bit of a reputation and came from a home that would be considered ""broken"". Both families insisted their children were victims of foul play. They appealed to the public and put up ads on billboards all over the city. In both cases the girls left for the school bus stop at the top of the road but never made it there. They just seemed to vanish. They were never seen alive again.For months there was speculation that Weaver had something to do with the girls vanishing but he denied it. I remember him giving a local news anchor a tour of his property showing his yard and proclaiming his innocence. I also remember being sickened when the truth came out. At the time of the interview they were standing on a recently poured cement pad and underneath that pad was the body of one of the girls in a blue barrel.I remember being glued to the TV for hours in August of that year as the story broke. Every local channel ran uninterrupted coverage that weekend. I remember watching them use ground penetrating radar and cadaver dogs. I remember the video from the news helicopters as the police sifted through the dirt looking for the bones of the missing girls. Eventually they were both found dead on the property. One of the bodies was found in a shed. The other girl had been put in blue barrels before she was buried behind the house and then covered with concrete where Weaver planned to put a new hot tub. I remember crying for the families of those children whose lives were cut short by a monster. Watching this movie with all the similarities brought all of this to mind in vivid detail.What I took from this movie was that this could happen to anyone's child in the blink of an eye. I grew up in that neighborhood. I had a friend that lived in the same apartments that those two girls had lived in. When I was a teenager I went to the same schools that Ashley and Miranda went to. I walked on the same roads, shopped at the same stores, etc. If this horror had happened 10 years earlier, it could have been me or one of my friends. From time to time I still have to drive past the place where those girls died and laid hidden in the ground while their families searched for them. Eventually they tore the house down but the land will never go away.Who cares if the acting is bad, the writing is corny, the budget was cheap or if it was shot in a week - It is the message that is important.

As a parent this is a wake up call... to let my teen watch this, well I wont, just because I would prefer to talk about this and make her aware rather than etch the graphic nature of the movie into her young mind... and knowing the teenage reactions it would probably serve no other purpose than for her to say well ""that would never happen to me..""

165,charlie-j-munn,the gore de-values the message.,3,26 October 2011,"Before I even start reviewing this film let me state that this film is filled with rape, dead bodies, foul language and gruesome images. Not advised for anyone under 18.I've read several reviews for this ""film"" but they all seem to be bias, by letting the message of the film overlap the quality of it. Meaning that just because a movie means well, doesn't make it a good film. To review this film fairly I'm going to break it down on two parts. The technical side then story/message. The film is directed and written by Michael Goi, who judging by his filmography is a mainly a t.v show and documentary DP. Megan Is Missing relies on the new wave story telling device of ""mockumentry'. Which forces the movie to use a plot device of lost footage from the lead characters video camera, web camera and cell phones. So in some way you could excuse the poorly shot scenes or unnatural lighting due to the attempt of making it 'real'. The script is simply poor, it's ill-written. The plot is bare and lacks redeemable characters. I understand that these girl go through hell. But strictly speaking as characters you don't care for them and if you do its because you have embodied your own personal feelings on to these actors. I point to a scene in which Megan is explain her first blow-job when she was 10. This 5 minute scene does nothing to further plot and just makes Megan unlikeable. Also the script does a poor job of showing what high school is like. Yes it can be as superficial as this movie portrays but this movie makes it hyperbolic.The acting is terrible with the exception of Amber Perkins who plays Amy. The cast is extremely fake. With an poorly written script all the actors are forced to tell and not show. All characters seem to simply doing what Goi has instructed. The scenes where they're video chatting are simply put terrible scenes. I understand how hard it is to put yourself out there like these actors have done, but it was not worth it. The message is to be aware of who you talk to on the internet. A cause of which I'am an advocate for. But with a plot that barely touches upon until the last 30 minutes and within those 30 minutes 22 of them are unwatchable. I believe this movie had potential. But the shock, awe and disgust you see in the last 22 minutes overlap any message this movie tried to convey. It was no longer about how bad it is to talk to strangers but ""Oh my god, why am seeing this."" This movie lost its reach to thousands of people when it decided to use shock and awe to scare the audience. The 8 day shooting schedule shouldn't effect anyones' review. They set the schedule and they made the product. Instead of showing kid's the dangers of Internet predators it scares them. So they don't know why they should be afraid they just are. If you want to show your kids the horrors of drugs, partying and Internet predators look at a movie called Thirteen directed by Catherine Hardwick. This movie is simply poorly made, poorly acted and uses horror to convey a message that is not that one dimensional.",Megan Is Missing
166,mariaroberts,Disappointing average and over rated,4,16 February 2012,"Having recently watched 'Megan is missing'(written and directed by Michael Gori)spurred a few thoughts in my mind, and in fact how badly a so called 'horror' film can be directed.Although all seems bad praises go to the writter in some kind of an extent for 'attempting' to bring a film to bring awareness to some's eyes.Megan Stewart (14) and best friend Amy Herman (13) though differ to one another spend nearly every moment, day, and minute together. Clinging together for social acceptance. Megan becomes intrigued with a 'boy' on the internet, without knowing that this boy is in fact a paedophile, 'MAN'If you consider the first 30 minutes of this film, it makes you feel as though you are back in school watching one of those educational teen documentaries that make teens think twice.This film being rated a 15+ is a joke to me, it's disappointing and in fact disgusting. Me myself being a 15 year old was mentally scarred having watched this movie it's great to watch and be aware of the issues that can actually go on in the world we live in about 30 minutes in. But paedophilia for a film should not be shown this way.Genuinely, realistically this film's moral issue should be aimed and shown to the clueless, teenagers and under-age.But no, this film could not be shown to a 12 year old, and the reason being the last 30 minutes of this film turns into a mental amount of minutes of torture, rape and the de-humiliation of humans.Since when was it OK to promote drinking and underage sex okay to do? Since when was making a film so unrealistic to real life issues okay? and most definitely above all since when was it okay to present such an issue as this in the most wrong way ever? Take Trust (2010) a film including the same issue but different understandably okay scenes, it presents the issue with no need of there being any rape and violence in such a way Megan is missing is presentingSo really, watch this film go for it it's most definitely not a great film its just one that you'll watch be shocked about and recover from watching this disastrous film about two days after This film is most definitely 'missing' the point.",Megan Is Missing

This is the first time I have ever taken the initiative to write a movie review online and it's honestly just so other people might not have to go through the same trauma of watching this as I did.Going into this and reading the box of the movie we thought that this might be an accurate account of the kidnapping of this 14 year old girl. Instead the movie immediately focuses on underage drinking, sex, and drug abuse at explicitly inappropriate costs. It goes to the point of exploiting young children in a way that should not be acceptable. You can tell a story of child abduction and horrible things happening without showing scenes of a 14 year old girl being brutally tortured and raped. At this point I finally turned off the movie and started to bawl my eyes out and scream at my husband for even picking it up at the store. I was appalled that a store like FAMILY video of all places would even carry a piece of crap like this.Again, it is one thing to just tell a story about child abduction, but COMPLETELY another to show absolutely horrible things happening to little girls.

Not many... How many Jeffrey Dahmers exist? Not many. This movie tries to make it look as if these people are a dime a dozen.(Whether you buy that or not is up to you.)

I will not go into any detail, but will say it was no pick nick, and I'm extremely lucky to be alive today. I give this a 5 because it's half of what it should be. Although the events are quite accurate the presentation leaves it dull, and I did not care about the actors which in my opinion would have driven home the intent a lot harder, and probably would have helped the negativity this movie is getting. You cant go from ""Meh.. who cares"" to ""OMG that's frigging disturbing"" without some likeness to create sympathy towards the main actors. I didn't cry, and wasn't all that shocked to be honest. Though I should have been. I've cried about less accurate stories about the same subject, and truthfully do have sympathy for anyone who goes through this.

Parents need to realize that although the film boasts that it is sending a message about online sexual predators this film is very brutally graphic. I got tired of hearing moms say they were making their daughters watch this. No normal parent would let their children watch this garbage to ""send a message"". Be a parent and do your job. It wasn't hard to find out where some of the ideas came from for the film. It was loosely based, but drew from the murders of two young Oregon girls. Their murderer was not even a man they met online but a neighbor who's daughter they befriended. They were also abducted on their was to school. Only one was buried in the blue barrel in the back yard, the other in box in his shed. He was caught and convicted and is serving out two life sentences. Sure stuff like this happens every day but it can be put forward as a message sender like movies such as ""Trust"" to get the point across, not a below B flick horror.

That last half hour though... man. I also knew beforehand that it was based on things that had happened so seeing it was much worse than hearing about it on the news. Even knowing this and worse has happened, I can still barely comprehend the evil a predator has in them. Think of this. Did YOU listen to your parents warnings about everything? Your kids won't either so imagine your child is the ""pure"" one and then think of this happening to them.",Megan Is Missing

First, the message was very loud and prominent, despite production and the screen writing. Come one these are teenagers we are talking about here. Anyways, my 17 year cousin decided to watch this movie with my 16 year old sister. I thought it looked corny and to be honest another one of those paranormal activity movies or some boring film. Pretty much up until the last 22 minutes I had one eye on the movie and the other on the time. I was wrong in so many ways. Forever more I will never forget this film. Those images are tattooed in my mind, like having a bad taste in your mouth that will never go away. I literally felt sick to my stomach and angry at the same time. I am a 30 year old woman and I wanted to curl up and sleep with my mother after watching this sick mess! A bitter-sweet moment, however, our teenagers can now have a better perspective on how the internet is alive and well with those who have bad intentions. I would recommended any household with teenagers to watch this film. I am happy that my sister especially watched this film because my mother stays on her case about the internet and she can now see exactly what my mother is talking about.**Keep in mind that it is very graphic I must say.**",Megan Is Missing

After the ""real"" pictures are shown I turned it off immediately. What I saw on the screen was far too disturbing and there should have been a better warning. Overall this ""film"" was disgusting, tasteless, and morbid. Do not watch under all means, you will not sleep.

Because i think it would be a crime and an irresponsibility not to warn the world from the insulting garbage i just watched. The problem with this movie is everything! I can't imagine hoe they could ever think this was good. the acting is abysmal, the writing is lazy and even funny (in a bad way) and the directing is worst than terrible. The overall idea of the movie is just wrong, the way the characters behave is not even close to how real people would act. The whole point of the movie is antagonizing the internet when the director and the creators of the movie don't even understand the concept of online browsing. THE DIRECTOR... Oh my god this guy made some mistakes not even i would have made in a high school movie project! The quality of the shots doesn't match the devices this movie is supposed to be shot with (like cellphones, ""computer files"", and web-cam footage) WHO the HELL says COMPUTER FILES! There is even a scene where you can actually hear the guy yelling ""ACTION!"" and he didn't edit that out. How careless is that? Have you no shame? I was so impressed by this that I googled the guy, and he is the... wait i have to take a moment to say this... he is the PRESIDENT of the ASC (American Society of Cinematographers) That's it people. I'm out... I've got nothing. Do yourself a favor, and don't watch this movie. It's dumb, it's childish, it's terribly written, terribly acted, horribly edited and insultingly bad directed.

Not the exact genre or what happens in it but a movie that is well made, realistic and typically for me hand-held camera style. I love when the talking is realistic and the characters are like people I've known in real life. An example of this is a movie called ""June 9"". I know people like that and would do things that those people do.Megan is Missing caught me off guard I have to say. I'm not into chick flicks and the beginning would have you think that it's another teen- angst, discovering life kind-of-deal. Well it's not, trust me. Far from it. Megan is Missing starts off slow and builds on the characters ever so slowly. You'll learn of the daily routines of Megan and her best friend, the self conscious Amy played brilliantly by Amber Perkins. Amber does an excellent job as the self depreciating best friend and Megan played by the mesmerizing Rachel Quinn as the ""hottie"" and social queen of the group.Once this movie starts kicking, it won't let you go and really grips you. I really needed cheering up the first time I watched it and man did it. Again, not the subject. The subject is horrifying. Honestly, it's almost too much but I love horror movies like this. I watched it the 2nd time with two friends and they were stunned. The one guy said his stomach hurt after and I'm like, so you liked it? He's like ya but it was almost too much. Kind of sums it up.I want to shout out to Michael Goi for making such a wonderful horror/suspense film. Trust me, if you understand that this movie is extremely low budget and deals with a very disturbing subject matter, then let yourself go and watch in amazement as this engrossing and for the most part, well acted (sorry Jael Elizabeth Steinmeyer & Kara Wang) movie can take you away for a while.

Along with her dull best friend. I appreciated the creepy factor and I didn't think the horror aspect was bad. It is just the face of how stupid teenage girls can be.

(may contain spoilers)",2,1 September 2015,"Basically; the cast was lacking personality, you don't feel sorry for basically any of them, and the and the acting was really bad. I don't know many teens that act the way these do; I sure didn't at their age. This movie is supposed to show the dangers of having your child talk to those online, and although cases like this DO happen (it said based on a true story, right?) There are many different scenarios, and this wouldn't really be one of them. I know that the teens in this movie would be smarter if this was more realistic than to get themselves into the situations they do.POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT: DON'T READ PAST IF YOU WANNA WATCH. Like other reviews, basically the first half of the movie is showing how Megan is the one of the ""popular girls"" due to most of the boys her age being attracted to her and the acts that she provides to them. She makes sex out to be like ""no big deal"", divulging her secrets to her best friend, Amy. Megan is 14 and Amy (for part of the movie) is only 13. Already Amy is being shamed for being a virgin, and is the most likable out of all of the cast. I don't really feel bad for Megan. Not saying that she deserves what happens to her, but that she doesn't come off as a nice person (I'm expecting us to have some sympathy for her since she DOES go missing...) except to Amy, which is nice since no one else gives her the time of day. When Megan goes missing, in fact, for someone so popular it really only feels like Amy is the one who cares that much, to go to certain lengths. The last 20 minutes are pure shock value, with like, three seconds being the scariest in the entire movie purely because its out of context and slightly gory(?) I think you're more made to feel sorry for Amy, than Megan, who goes missing shortly after her search for her best friend, although honestly, none of the characters really had any personality (Amy was less 2D than anyone else, even the main character.) A lot of the scenes were laughable and I was definitely disappointed in the movie. I give it 2 stars because I had some sympathy towards Amy at the end and that's the only feeling I got out of the movie.

Also, why wouldn't she tell someone that Megan was doing heroin? She seemed like a better friend than that. Another thing that bugged me was Lexie in Amy's video diary. She blames Amy for Megan's disappearance without a reason, and Amy doesn't seem to try and defend herself. Why on earth would they blame Amy anyway? This makes no sense. Even if it was well directed, it also lacks a decent plot. We have no understanding of the killer's motive, nor do we even watch enough gore for this to be considered at least gory.

Letting us see into the lives of two teenage girls who wanted to have some fun on the internet. I think many people can relate to that and perhaps even to the part where she decides to meet up with someone. After that, it's just downhill. The girl called Megan goes missing, her friend wants to find her and goes missing as well. There is this kind of wet girl with white eyes in a barrel and there are some scenes where we see the girl being not very happy while moving in a strange way (which apparently was supposed to be a rape scene). Apparently this is the ""unedited and unaltered"" footage from Amy's camera. Usually when creeps tape the stuff they do to their victims, they want to make sure everything is seen.

190,saberarcherlancer,This movie is the main argument as to why IMDb should have a rating less than 1,1,11 January 2015,"My god where to start.... this movie is so horribly bad that it actually made me write my first review here on IMDb. First of all, the ""acting"" is an insult and so is the directing and editing. Michael Goi clearly has no idea what he is doing. Technical screw ups aside, which on their own are already enough to drag the movie down to hell, the whole idea, concept and story are messed up as well.First of all, the whole ""Let's pretend this is actual footage"" thing just makes no sense. Never really liked the concept to begin with but this movie just doesn't even try, let's ignore the fact that it would never be allowed in a realistic scenario and that a lot of the stuff in the movie wouldn't have been recorded in the first place by a sane teen, how exactly would you get a hold of effing skype calls in the first place? Next issue is how the girls act.... Michael Goi just has no bloody idea. If aliens were tasked with portraying teenaged human beings this is what they would come up with. Doesn't help that no one in the movie can act for their life. Next, for all the people who are saying that it's the message that counts and not the movie. Two things. One, not gonna say that the internet can't be a dangerous place where teens can screw up, but this is just blowing things out of proportion and is nothing but silly fear mongering by a man who doesn't understand the internet and in the spirit of a pre-civilization human is afraid of that unknown. All in all, the message isn't half as important as people think it is. Two, it's still a movie and it can be criticized as such. It's the ever lasting social justice warrior bullshit of ""But the movie has a nice and positive message and is a force for good and as such whoever dares to say a bad thing about it is evil!"", well guess what, not the world doesn't work like that. Even if this movie cured cancer, stopped all wars, collected kittens and brought them to orphans and then provided them with loving parents and fed every single hungry person in the world, it was still be a bad painful to watch movie.And finally, about those 22 final minutes people like to bring up. For one it's shameless padding and two, during that rape scene that actress actually smiled, nearly chuckled. I mean bloody hell, can you get any more unprofessional than that? I burst out laughing at that point. I guess if you have a weak stomach and stuff and are easily offended those last parts can be problematic, but all i see are desperate attempts and a little Michael Goi standing in the background and screaming ""Ohoh! Look how disturbing it is! This could be your daughter/sister right now! Please by scared by that and like this movie for the great message it's sending! Be disturbed!"". This is just pathetic.

I thought it was actually a decent thriller movie. While the acting may not be the best throughout the movie, it's the plot and story that matter. This kind of thing happens more frequently than we realize, and I believe that this movie demonstrates that quite well.Yes, the movie was a bit over the top near the end, as this doesn't always happen, but it was disturbing nonetheless, as it was intended to be. Don't go into this movie expecting an absolute masterpiece of a movie. Try not to be overly critical during the movie and you will most likely enjoy it as long as you are into disturbing horror/thriller movies. If you hate movies like that, then this won't be for you.

I guess you guys forgot that this was supposed to be 14 year old girls and not adults. Honestly... this was a good movie, and It got its point across with having to go super overboard like ""The Girl Next Door"" which is a very gruesome movie that I would not want to watch again and believe me I have seen a lot of crazy movies.

I mean she was like 10 years old. A child. They were both talking about it so excitedly like is the best thing that can happen to a kid. I watched many (fictional) disturbing movies but only by this scene takes the cake.

196,sazxoxo,The brutal truth of how you could be talking to anyone online.,8,23 May 2017,"*Contains spoilers* So this is my first ever review and quite honestly the only reason I signed up to IMDb was to review this film. Many people on here have listed it as a film that is too disturbing and hard to stomach so being a big fan of the ""disturbing"" film genre it was an absolute MUST for me to see what all the hype was about. If you do seek out this film for its shock value and gore you will have to persevere for the majority of the film, I will say that. There was many points where I did think of switching it off and giving up as the first hour and a bit of the film is filled with quite bad acting, mainly on the part of Megan's character but I decided to see it through to see if there was in fact this ""stomach turning"" scene.The film revolves around two best friends Megan who is 14 and Amy who is 13. Megan is highly over sexualised for a 14 year old she goes to parties, performs sexual acts with boys and does drugs which I'm sure MOST 14 year olds do not do. Her acting is rather annoying however I'm unsure if it was the way the director tried to portray her or just her annoying personality and the way she she comes across to the views. Her best friend Amy is the complete opposite she doesn't go to parties and is shy and quiet - however she does involve herself in one party with Megan at the beginning. Megan begins talking online to this boy who claims his name is Josh and gets Megan to go on webcam and show of her body a bit even though he tells her his webcam is ""broken"". This is where I got frustrated any 14 year old in their right mind would know there was something wrong as soon as this was said, it gets even more frustrating when she decides to meet up with this boy ""Josh"" and never returns. We then see a number of news reports and CCTV footage of where Megan gets kidnapped by a man in a van.Her friend Amy then decides contacting Josh using her computer as she knows he was the last person to see Megan. As you can imagine he begins to threaten her and stalking her and there is this one creepy scene where we see him in the background of one of Amy's video diary's. If it wasn't already obvious enough he then proceeds to kidnap Amy and keeps her in this underground dungeon.This is where the last 20 minutes begin of the ""stomach churning"" scenes people have felt sick over. There is two actual pictures of Megan shown where she is has her head and wrists in an guillotine like board with her mouth clamped open with a metal device kneeling in her underwear. We then see Amy chained to a wall in her underwear where ""Josh"" throws buckets of cold water over arm and makes her drink and eat on her hands and knees like a dog this is where he then proceeds to rape her. This did unsettle me slightly as all we are shown is Amy's head held again a table, tears running down her face being rocked back and fourth. He then tells Amy to get in a barrel. When she opens this we are shocked into seeing her best friend Megan's body in the barrel decomposing and Amy is forced in beside her. The last ten minutes of the film is ""Josh"" burying this barrel in a forest hearing only Amy's screams and pleading with the unknown man. Throughout the whole film we never get to see ""Josh's"" face or find out his real name. I'm unsure of what makes this film more unsettling perhaps the shock realisation of that we don't always know who we are talking to online and this can actually happen in real life if we are not careful enough, or the knowledge that it is based on seven different child abduction stories.",Megan Is Missing
197,capnmuninton,Terrible Acting and Cinematography,1,31 May 2017,"Throughout the entire film I did not believe one line that came from the ""actor's"" mouths. Most of their reactions were unrealistic and cliché. It's very unlikely that teenagers would stare at their screens without multitasking throughout the duration of a video call. Micheal Goi clearly has no understanding of the internet and teenagers if this is how he thinks they react to everyday situations. This movie, if you can even call it that, was incredibly difficult to take seriously and I could consider it to be more of a comedy than a thriller. Many of the scenes shot seemed uncoordinated. During a scene when Megan and Amy are about to speech with each other via video call, you could clearly hear Micheal Goi yelling 'Action'. All together, it was sloppy and boring.If you want to see a film that is beautifully created and shocking I would recommend Funny Games. (The original of 1997.)",Megan Is Missing
198,Romeorror,"Get off the internet Megan, you're drunk.",2,21 June 2017,"I heard about this movie from a friend who was demanded to watch this by her mother, claiming it would show her a glimpse of what would happen if she allowed her children on the internet. So she watched it, called her mother, and long story short, unfriended her on Facebook. I knew this had to be a good movie.I asked to borrow the DVD, I was ready. So hoping it was going to be this over the top fear mongering film like those ads where Peewee Herman appeared from the shadows and started talking to me about crack. I watched the whole thing. It was so bad. That one scene where a character confronts one of the main girls was amazing. If you don't think me and my friends act out that scene randomly for no reason, you'd be wrong. It tries to take itself too seriously when it doesn't even show how the internet really can harm a child. Megan didn't need to ONLY video chat with skaterboy, she could of messaged him, sent him pictures, video recorded her doing sexual things cause he asked her too. Built this relationship up until she goes missing. How much better would that have been rather then her just looking at me straight from the screen while talking to this guy? Please Megan, I don't like you like that and I hate confrontation.What can I say other then this is a movie. Can I recommend it? Yes and no. If you are looking for something that will scare you into not letting your kid even look at computer, don't watch this, instead watch Trust (2010) a movie that takes this almost same premise and does it better. On the other hand, if you have a horrible sense of humor and just enjoy bad movies, give this one a try.I'm bringing it to the next movie night and I told the friend whose hosting it and he is upset. It's gonna be good.",Megan Is Missing
199,jimu812,Worst movie I've ever watched.,1,21 August 2013,"I NEVER right reviews on any site but this movie was, seriously, the worst movie I've ever watched in my entire life. The movie doesn't have a happy ending. I was waiting for something scary to happen, but no dice. The acting is horrid from the start but I gave it a chance, hoping the movie would be something like paranormal activity (because of the hand held camera views), but I'd rather dive off a bridge into shallow water than waste my time watching this movie again. I'm not a picky movie critic what-so-ever, but this was just bad. I understand that it's trying to show the dangers of the Internet, but watch a documentary on online dangers or how to catch a predator and just spare yourself the time.... At some points in the movie i want to kill myself... think family guy when peter falls down and hurts his knee, only wothout the humor and for ten minutes instead of thirty seconds. I don't see how anyone is giving this anything more than a 1 star. I really wish that I could give it a zero. The only thing scary in this movie is the acting. TRUST ME!",Megan Is Missing

And even at that, it just looked like Sam from ICarly.",Megan Is Missing
201,ericlorenz,Horrible,1,21 June 2011,"We left the last 22 minutes uncut from Amy's cam to pad the movie some more. Amy pleading in the barrel for the last 15+ minutes of the movie (it may have been more, I had to fast forward) while Josh is digging is excruciating. Not many movies make me angry, but this one did.The only part that was somewhat shocking even if they did show the barrel every time Josh went to see Amy in the dungeon/holding cell (wherever it was). We all knew Megan was in there, but the image of the decaying Megan was nicely done when he opened it up.Don't get me wrong, I love horror/suspense movies like these but pass on this one. It's not worth your time.",Megan Is Missing
202,jacko-26008,very unrealistic and VERY poorly executed.,2,26 February 2019,"This review is going to contain spoilers, but it was so bad that you shouldn't care about spoilers anyways so just keep reading especially since there are a lot of potentially triggering sequences that are simultaneously hard to watch but also just gross and unethical to be putting into movies that I feel like people may need warnings for.I just finished this movie (even though i skipped through the last 15 minutes of the movie because it was just 15 minutes of a guy digging a hole) and I've gotta say I have no idea why people find this movie to be disturbing or creepy or any of that. It was literally just an hour of teenagers being teenagers (even though no 14 year old I've ever known would straight-up give a blowjob for cocaine or still sleep with a teddy bear that's literally her best friend) and then when one of them goes missing everyone is super fake and annoying and dickish to the other girl. And then the last 20 minutes was just a bunch of sexploitation and an unnecessarily long rape of a 14-year-old and then a 15 minute buried alive sequence that really didn't need to be there. I alsoo thought the acting was ATROCIOUS. None of the teenagers acted like normal teenagers and Ashley (or Amy or whatever the other girl who isn't Megan's name is) was completely devoid of a personality and was not connected with the character at all until the very end. The cinematography was atrocious as well and I could barely see what was going on at any point in this movie, especially the party sequence. It was so dark and shaky that I genuinely couldn't see anything. My last gripe with this was the entire last 22 minutes this film is known for. If you don't want to be spoiled for this movie don't keep reading and just skip to my final thoughts, but this movie is seriously so bad it shouldn't matter. So basically what happens at the end of this movie is Ashley or Amy or whatever gets kidnapped as well and the kidnapper takes her camera with him to film her while he has her captive. In these last 22 minutes, we see that she is trapped in a sort of makeshift prison cell where she's chained to the wall and the only thing besides that chain that's keeping her in the cage is a flimsy little tree branch that he shoved into the lock hole. It just doesnt make sense why he wouldn't at least put a metal rod in the hole instead but that's not even the worst of it. The kidnapper basically makes her eat like a dog with her hands behind her back so she can have her teddy bear as a reward I guess??? Even though literally NOBODY in this situation would care about their stuffed bear more than getting out. Sure it would be a comfort thing, but I wouldn't have just gotten on my knees and eaten like a dog if I were her just so I could hold my bear again. And then the absolute worst scene of the entire movie comes up: the horrific and unnecesarily disturbing and much-too-long rape scene. He basically lays Amy on the table and starts to rape her. The scene is almost 5 minutes long and all you see is her face and hear him thrusting into her and you see the light slowly leaving her eyes as she just gives up. Now, I wouldn't be as angry with this scene as I am but the fact that it was FIVE MINUTES LONG and the victim was FOURTEEN YEARS OLD and that there was BLOOD is just disgusting. It is very exploitative and predatory and I just REALLY hated that scene. It's the reason this isnt a 3 or a 4 out of 10. But the second worst part in the entire film was the last 10-15 minutes. All that hapopens in the last 10-15 minutes is the guy digs a hole while the girl is trapped in a barrel next to Megan's corpse pleading that he let her go. During this time, the hole is dug just deep enough for him to bury the barrel and you hear Amy puking and pleading the whole time. It was SO BORING and I legit skipped through it because I was just so done with this garbage fire of a movie that I genuinely couldn't stand it any longer. And then the credits roll and you get a stupid montage of Megan and Amy singing the Baby Shark song and messing around with each other because that's apparently realistic to what 14 year old girls do??Overall, this was one of the absolute worst movies I've ever put myself through and I wouldn't suggest it to literally anyone.",Megan Is Missing
