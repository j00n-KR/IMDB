0,SnoopyStyle,"beautiful, erotic and confusing",6,23 June 2015,"Lucía (Paz Vega) is beside herself after getting a disturbing call. She abandons everything and goes to Balearic Islands. Six years ago, her boyfriend Lorenzo gets the married Elena pregnant in an one-night stand. He's struggling to write and meets Lucía at a café. She moves into his place. Then Lorenzo learns about his daughter and gets involved with her babysitter Belén.This movie has two overwhelming aspects. The nudity is very explicit and the story is very confusing. I'm not offended by the nudity but maybe some people are. I'm more concerned about the confusing mix of past, present and the imaginary novel story. I don't think I'm an idiot but this blender-mix of real and unreal leaves me lost. I don't think it's even suppose to make sense at all. It's a jigsaw puzzle with no solution. In the end, it's all made up and non-sensible. It's a beautiful, erotic jumbo.",Sex and Lucía
1,claudio_carvalho,"Excessively Erotic, Confused Screenplay, But Also Very Intriguing",7,10 June 2005,"In Madrid of the present days, the waitress Lucia (Paz Vega) leaves her job and goes to her apartment to meet her mate Lorenzo (Tristian Ulloa), who seems to be very depressed. When she arrives, she receives bad news about Lorenzo from the police. She moves alone to an isolated island, where she meets a stranger and lodges in a pension where he is living for the last months. The story shifts to six years ago, when Lorenzo and a woman, without knowing even the name of each other, have a magnificent sexual intercourse. The woman gets pregnant, and her daughter is raised with out a father. Meanwhile, Lorenzo is a writer that lost his creation skills and one night meets Lucia in a restaurant. She confesses to him that she is in love with him and has been stalking him for a long time. They fall in love for each other and Lucia moves to his apartment. Later, Lorenzo is informed by his friend Pepe (Javier Cámara) that he has a daughter, and he meets her in a square, with her baby sitter. From this point on, Lorenzo mixes his reveries with reality.""Lucia y el Sexo"" is a weird movie, with a style that resembles David Lynch. I am not sure whether this was the intention of the director Julio Medem, or whether his screenplay is indeed only confused. There are too much gratuitous sex scenes and exposure of genitals, inclusive of penises, and although Paz Vega is a delicious woman, I do not like this type of appellative exaggeration in a film. The story has good points, does not have clichés, and has many metaphoric scenes. I understand that the title of this movie mainly refer to periods of time, ""Lucia"" in the present days, sharing her life with Lorenzo, and ""Sex"" the consequences of his intercourse with an unknown woman six years ago. In the end, I found ""Lucia y el Sexo"" an excessively erotic film, with a confused screenplay, but also very intriguing. I intend to see this movie again in a near future and reevaluate it, trying to see if it becomes clearer after a second time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Lucia e o Sexo"" (""Lucia and the Sex"")",Sex and Lucía
2,rmax304823,A Keeper Without a Lighthouse,6,17 February 2006,"I can't remember seeing many movies that were more beautifully shot than this one. It doesn't hit you over the head like one of David Lean's colossal spectacular stupendous architectiptoptoloftical magnificences but it is quietly effective. Faded when it needs to be, dark and moody when required. It's not just the pretty setting. The interiors are as well done as the undulating sea grass. And the performances are equally accomplished.The plot, though. Well -- the plot. It's as if the people behind the movie had gorged themselves on Finnegans Wake and Borges to the point of bursting and then had sat down and storyboarded the whole movie on a major binge. (And I thought only the French could outfox me.)There are some notions -- I hesitate to call them ""themes"" -- that run through the movie. There is the sea, of course, and the island, and the moon (""Luna""), and sex, telling stories, and conception and birth, and reproduction. I'm being kind of loose with some of those definitions so that ""reproduction"", for instance, includes writing novels, as does ""telling stories"" to children.I'm on kind of shaky ground with most of those ideas so let's stick to sex, which I more or less understand. There's all sorts of hetero- and autosexual stuff in it, maybe even a hint of bestiality, but you get used to it. I went through the Human Sexuality Training Program at Berkeley along with a couple of hundred other professional types, many of them elderly ladies. The first thing the organizers did was have everyone sit down in an amphitheater and watch one full hour of pornographic movies, homosexuals at work, old folks, elephants. Satiated, the participants were no longer shockable and were ready to deal frankly with sex. This movie has a similar effect. One erect penis may be worth a gasp but by the time the second rolls around you're wondering what it has to do with the plot.And, I'm sorry but I still can't get over the plot. This guy Lorenzo is evidently trying to write a novel, see, and this girl, Paz Vega, a total stranger, approaches him in a bar and suggests they live together. And at the end they ARE living happily together. It's everything in between that stumps me. I could ask a dozen questions about the plot but will just give one example. What happened to the little girl, Luna? I could make as good a guess as anyone else but it would still be just that, a guess. Anyway, I won't list them all because you'll be asking yourselves the same questions after you see this film.Not that I want to bash it. As I said, the actors are uniformly good. I especially liked the novelist, Lorenzo, who has a face that is sympatico without being the least bit handsome. And it's a movie for grownups, which nowadays is a novelty. There isn't the slightest nod to raw adolescent sensibilities. Phrases pop up from time to time that raise those little flags you see when you've marked an email message in your inbox as worthy of more attention. ""A lighthouse without a keeper."" The plot may be a lot more murky than the Mediterranean Sea in this film but I sat through it all with interest, waiting to see how or if they could pull it all together.",Sex and Lucía
3,ma-cortes,Julio Medem's sensitive and emotive film that launched Paz Vega to stardom,5,5 February 2020,"Lucía (Paz Vega) is a young waitress in a restaurant in the centre of Madrid. Lorenzo (Tristan Ulloa) is a a writer who is blocked , while his editor (Javier Camara) suggests him he write about a sexual tryst and to put a lot of sex in it . This meeting is interrupted by the beautiful young woman Lucia who confesses she has been watching him for some time , since she fell in love with his first novel . Then, there takes place an enjoyable romance between them . Later on , it happens a distress and Lucia seeks refuge on a quiet , secluded Mediterranean island Formentera -in Majorca Islands- ; there Lucia starts discovering the dark corners of her past . Various lives (Najwa Nimri , Daniel Freire, Paz Vega) converge on an isolated island , all connected by an author whose novel has become inextricably entwined with his own life.A poetic and complex film , resulting in a little boring and dull story .This is a surprising , mysterious , ravishing and gorgeous picture ; however , it turns out to be tiring . Strange story about peculiar love stories among unsettling and grieving youngsters who suffer distresses and unfortunes . Spanish production with fine acting , colorful cinematography , excellent settings and rousing musical score by Alberto Iglesias . Julio Medem directed the film for Sogetel and producers Enrique López Lavigne , Fernando Bovaira , and it was released in 2001 . Julio Medem likes to disorient , his characters like to challenge each other too . Love and sex are the dual starting points for the entwined script strands of another Julio Medem walk in a world full of sensitivity and pain . There's lots of sex here , exhibicionist , ecstatic , and exuberant giving way to a more damaging hedonism . Although the film itself starts slow and running outwards and backwards , teasing with its secrets .Exceptional cinematography showing Formentera island , bathed in an atmosphere of fresh air and dazzling sun by Kiko De La Rica . It displays a sensitive and emotive musical score by Alberto Iglesias . The motion picture was originally directed by Julio Medem . This is his most successful film , his first movie was ¨Vacas¨, his second one , ""Ardilla Roja"" or ¨The red squirrel¨ released in 1993, was selected for the Cannes Film Festival and it confirmed Medem's talents and won prizes in Fort Lauderdale, Bogota and Bucarest . Medem had been making short movies with a super-8 camera owned by his father until he received a call from a new production company called Sogetel and executive producers Fernando de Garcillán , José Luis Olaizola , Enrique López Lavigne . They were interested in his script titled ""Vacas"" . It won the Goya Award from the Spanish academy for best new director, and won prizes in the festivals of Tokyo, Torino and Alexandria. In 1998 Medem released "" The lovers of the Polar Circle ,"" considered his best movie by most of his fans . It also became a box-office hit with more than one million spectators in Spain and was also released worldwide. In 2001 his fourth movie, ""Lucia and sex ,"" became a huge hit and began the career of actress Paz Vega who won the Goya for best new actress . Although in 2003 failed with the release , ""The Basque ball"" , a documentary that portrays the phenomenon of nationalism and terrorism in the Basque Country of northern Spain , it was very polemical and partial . In 2007 directed the flop ¨Caotica Ana¨ and in 2010 , ¨Room in Rome¨, a successful though with not sense film , plenty of nudism and only starred by two gorgeous naked girls . Julio Medem is for sure one of the the most important and original Spanish filmmaker. Rating : 5.5/10 . Well worth watching if you get the chance , thanks to photography and soundtrack , though a little bit boring and slow-paced .",Sex and Lucía
4,sunwarrior13,More Than Just A Sexy Movie,10,9 September 2012,"Sex and Lucia is a Spanish drama film written and directed by Julio Médem, and starring Paz Vega and Tristán Ulloa. As suggested by the title, there is a great deal of passionate sexual content surrounding the love story of Lucía and Lorenzo as the plot dissolves into a very lyrical eroticism. The movie features a highly non-linear story line with repeated surreal references to the ocean and beach. Lucia (Vega) is a young Madrid waitress who is devastated to hear of the death of her old flame Lorenzo (Ulloa). Hoping to flee her troubles, she seeks out a beautiful island paradise her dead lover often talked about. There she meets and befriends Carlos and Elena, who are also refugees of personal tragedies. Unbeknownst to all of them, the three each have a connection to Lorenzo. Years previously, Elena had a spontaneous fling with Lorenzo on the same island on the beach. Nine months later, she bore his daughter, Luna, but unable to raise a child on her own, she enlisted the help of a nurse, Belen. In attempting to reconnect with the child he never knew, Lorenzo had a passionate affair with Belen, one which caused her to neglect Luna, with tragic results. As Lucia slowly learns these details, she recalls the book Lorenzo was writing just before his death, and soon the lines between fact and fiction begin to slip away.Not every movie that is billed as 'erotic' deserves that distinction, but Sex And Lucia certainly does. It's the kind of intelligent, thoughtful film about sex and love that Hollywood just can't make as it presents a bizarre, alternately joyful and gloomy take on sexual fantasies and complications.",Sex and Lucía
5,jotix100,Sex according to Julio Medem,5,29 August 2002,"Has anyone picked up the trend of Spanish film directors? When they don't have anything better to say, or to present anything worthwhile, they resort to showing sex, preferably, female genitalia, or even male apparatuses, to distract the naive viewer into believing they are watching something artistic.Well, not so. Ethel, a friend who lives in Madrid, and avoids the Spanish cinema like the plague, told me in two words what she believed this film to be about: CHEAP PORNO!Never were there more clever words spoken! Julio Medem, might be an intellectual in Spain, but he certainly cannot cut the mustard, as demonstrated by his previous output: Los amantes del circulo polar and Vacas.... Only in Spain, or in Europe, for that matter would anyone invest money into these disasters that pass as ""art"" films there as well as here.In the first place, the sex in the film is completely gratuitous and in your face. Paz Vega is an attractive woman, who no doubt will do better than in this movie. Frankly, I have no objection to have Paz Vega showing her charms all the time but the same should be expected of Tristan Ulloa! So, if the director wants to reveal to us all what Ms. Vega has to offer, how about getting equal time and give everyone a view of what Mr. Ulloa has in store? If we are going to be fair, then, let it all hang out! The new Spanish Cinema isn't afraid to bare all to the world, but they don't have a clue what they're showing. Let's hope Mr. Medem talents will help him land a job as the director of the local Playboy, where he could really show it all without subjecting us to trash like this. The afternoon session I attended had a Viagra crowd. At the end, I overheard one man tell another: ""Great Film, I've seen it about 10 times already!...""",Sex and Lucía
6,lastliberal,Much more than Vega's skintastic moment,8,5 July 2008,"Sure, this is the film where Paz Vega bares all and gives us many skintastic moments, but it is much more than that. It is also Elena Anaya's hottest picture. OK, now that we got the fact that two incredibly beautiful women give us the performances of their lives out of the way, let's focus on why this is a really good film, and not just a peep show.It's a surreal, non linear story of a writer who commits suicide, or does he?; of a sexual encounter that results in a child; of an enter-twining of a new love with the old life; of a story with real life. It is beautiful, romantic, and haunting with Oscar-nominee Alberto Iglesias' (The Kite Runner, The Constant Gardener) score.Paz Vega (Spanglish), Tristán Ulloa, Najwa Nimri (Before Night Falls), and Elena Anaya (appears in the elusive Alatriste) give super performances in this film.It is the best performance I have seen from Paz Vega.",Sex and Lucía
7,Boba_Fett1138,Brilliantly made and constructed movie.,9,22 January 2007,"This is really one of the better constructed movies I've seen in a while.Both the storytelling and style of the movie can be called unique.It starts mixing reality with fiction and its hard to tell what really happened and what didn't. It features lots of 'what-if' themes and the story is being rewritten in the characters mind, also with lots of symbolism, mainly with the moon and the water. It doesn't make this the most accessible movie but then again, you don't ever have to watch an European movie for its accessibility.Things start off quite slow but as the story develops the story gets more and more complicated and non-linear, when the line between fiction and reality gets blurred more and more. It does make the movie hard to follow at times but it at the same time makes the movie more interesting to watch and enables everybody start to define things on their own. You of course have to be open to these sort of movies though. Also the very explicit nudity isn't just for everybody.Sex plays a key part in the movie. It helps to tell the story and plays a significant role in the story lines and help to indicate when things are truth or fiction. Never before has sex played such a key part in the storytelling of a movie.This movie is always presented as a Paz Vega but this movie it's main character is in my opinion played by Tristán Ulloa. He's the writer, were the entire movie involves around. The story is mostly set inside his head. The three main actors (Paz Vega, Tristán Ulloa, Najwa Nimri) of the movie are really good and carry the entire movie.Visually the movie is really great and impresses just as much as the storytelling of the movie. The camera-work and colors are really great and create a very unique atmosphere for the movie. It helps to make ""Lucía y el sexo"" an even bigger and more enjoyable movie to watch, visually.Those who are open for an unique, one of a kind, unusual movie experience, will surely be delighted with this magnificent beautiful looking and constructed movie.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Sex and Lucía
8,zetes,How 'bout some super sex?,8,25 March 2012,"Extraordinarily sexy, brain-twisting melodrama from Spain. Paz Vega (who tried and failed to get a Hollywood career going with Spanglish) stars as a woman who hooks up with her favorite author (Tristan Ulloa). After enjoying a life full of the greatest sex and romance ever, Ulloa discovers that a one-night stand from the past (Najwa Nimri) has been searching for him in Madrid with their daughter in tow. Unsure as to whether he wants to reconnect with Nimri, he seduces his daughter's nanny (The Skin I Live In's Elena Anaya) to get a closer look at his heretofore unknown progeny. The story is deliberately confusing - one's never sure whether the plot is actually happening or is part of the novel Ulloa is writing. Honestly, by the end of the film, I'd gotten over trying to make perfect sense of the plot (I was kind of assuming that the American release was heavily edited, but in reality only a couple of minutes of full frontal nudity were cut) and just enjoyed it for its beautiful images (shot digitally, which I think has its place) and all the hot, hot sex. Paz Vega is a total doll, but, man, when Anaya shows up, holy cow, is she just smoking. There's a long sequence where she wears this black teddy that just had me drooling. Medem (who directed the also quite good Lovers of the Arctic Circle) hooked up with Anaya again a couple of years ago with the lesbian flick Room in Rome, which I am now compelled to watch.",Sex and Lucía
9,=G=,A earnest misfire somewhere between prose and the paranormal,6,27 March 2003,"""Sex and Lucia"" is a subtitled drama out of Spain which swirls around a head-to-toe scrumptious Vega as it wends its way circuitously through its convoluted plot. Unfortunately the story can't reach out and grab the audience in spite of fine performances and good everything else because the emphasis is not on the players but on the diddled up storyline which is about as interesting as a mobius strip. In short, the film messes with the time domain which is more confounding than engrossing, more novel than substantive, and, after a 2+ hour run, wears out more than wraps up. An honest, sincere misfire, this flick will be of most interest to those into Eurodramas with tastefully done sex, nudity, and French angst. (B-)",Sex and Lucía
10,paul2001sw-1,Not quite porn,6,24 November 2004,"The best known of Julio Medem's early films, 'The Red Squirrel', told a story that combined mystery and sexual attraction, but ultimately failed to deliver on its hugely promising premise; 'Sex and Lucia' has much in common with its predecessor. Medem has a lively, eclectic, but wildly uneconomical film-making style, starting with a simple tale but soon throwing extra characters, plots within the plot, flashbacks, fantasy sequences, and the use of unsubtly iconographic images into the mix. Aided by a quality score, the film is always interesting, but the overall effect is less of a well constructed movie and more of a film that can't resist going (both stylistically and plot-wise) in every possible direction that its writer/director has been able to think of, almost as if he'd tried several variations around his central theme and hasn't yet decided which he should leave on the cutting room floor. In consequence, an initially taut story gradually loses focus and is only pulled together through some pretty contrived co-incidences.As for the sex so prominently advertised in the film's title, it's not exactly pornographic but it certainly owes something to that genre. Disavowing other representations of sex that are common in the cinema (coy/allusive, dreamy/idealised, bruto-comic realist, etc.), 'Sex and Lucia' takes a very object-oriented approach: this is a film about things, many of them uncommonly large, and the places where they go. There's a mechanical quality (X bares a buttock; Y sticks her nipple in Z's mouth, etc.) that personally I found rather wearisome. But perhaps that's just my taste. Anyway, it seems to be a style quite common in Spanish films, even those of the most mainstream variety.All told, there's less in here than the sum of its parts; but enough parts (in every sense) to raise this film about the mediocre, though hardly to the status of high art.",Sex and Lucía
11,secondtake,"Eleven points for artistic ambition, and achieving beauty, even with its overly affected editing and stylizing",8,22 November 2014,"Sex and Lucia (2001)A fascinating, moving, beautiful, sexy movie. Yes, it's about sex, and there are lots of sex scenes, some of them surprisingly graphic. But it's not about sex at all, in a way —or at least the bigger point is about recovery, and finding love, and the power of goodness. This makes it all sound sappy or sensational, and some people might find it so. But I think it is extremely serious and probing. And if this territory is not completely new, it's suddenly fresh and intriguing.And confusing. If there is one stumbling block for many it has to be the deliberately convoluted plot, and the convoluted way the plot is told through several time periods and with interchanging roles, or what seem to be people whose positions alter in each others' brains.Or not! What I mean is, I think it kind of makes sense, maybe perfect sense, if you study it. The key to it all, both the characters and what happens to them, is a writer and his book(s). Because one of the main characters is also the writer's most devoted (and obsessed) reader, the fictional elements become true, or at least get blurred with the truth, and so what the viewer sees (poor depraved viewer at this point) is partial and suggestive and puzzling.Which is exactly why the movie is so good. You have to let go of the facts a little and hang onto the mood, and to the characters (and the actors) who are quite real and palpable. In fact, one of the things that makes this so significant is the high level of acting—the author and the three main women that come through his world over six or seven years. The emotional intensity, from joy (and ecstasy) to horror (and grief) is quite intense.There is a lingering feeling of awkwardness to the production of the movie. It's not just that it's a hair low budget—this is part of the feel of it, and it's quite beautiful overall—but that it uses certain editing quirks and filming styles (like blown out highlights in some scenes) to create effect. Sometimes this is helpful for keeping track of different points in the shifting narrative. Sometimes you are too aware of it. At least the first time.I've seen this only once, and I can imagine watching it again someday. It might well grow on you, getting a little clarity but also revisiting the emotional dips and peaks a second time. One small heads up for people who might need to know—there is a rather too-long section near the start with lots of frank and varied sex, and it drags a bit (and is too self-indulgent for the plot), but then the rest of the movie largely avoids it (not completely!). So if this is a turn-off, get through that part and see what turns up next. The movie never expands outside its small group of characters or its limited range of sets and locations, but it inhabits these places with increasing interest. Director/writer Julio Medem has succeeded at something here. See what it is.",Sex and Lucía
12,Chris_Docker,Outstanding European cinema,8,13 May 2002,"(8/10) Refreshing, delightful, sexy. moving and thought-provoking movie from Spain. Not really porn (as the title might suggest) although there is some very artistic explicitness. It is movies like this one that remind us that European cinema can scale the emotional dilemmas and mountains of a story where other films look at a storyline in terms of physical developments. Lucia, a young waitress in Madrid, falls completely in love with a writer. After a period of blissful togetherness, something from his past pulls him in two directions. We are caught up in his moral dilemma, of not wanting to lose the wonderful gift he has found and yet not wanting to be untrue to himself. The semi-autobiographical novel he is writing pulls together the story and the emotions and hopes of the characters and introduces ideas that enable them to heal some of their hurt.  A central idea is that of finding a hole (symbolically on the sandy beach) where, after reaching the end of the story, you can jump back into the middle. That way you can try an make things turn out better (""If you give me time"", says Lorenzo, Lucia's boyfriend.) 	A more mature and rounded work than the Director's earlier ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle"", Sex and Lucia combines wonderful acting, a great story, innovative cinema and spine-tingly beautiful photography.

13,caspian1978,Sex and the Story,7,6 December 2004,"Your typical ""foreign"" movie that attracts its audience with sex, sex, and more sex. Don't get me wrong, this is a great story with a terrific cast and with well done direction. Still, without the sex, does this movie have an audience? The box cover for the movie as well as the title to the movie screams to its audience what it is most likely to offer. SEX! SEX! SEX! Still, while most French, Italian and Spanish ""foreign"" films that make their way onto the American video shelves are packed with sex but with very little story. Here, the movie has both. If you watch closely, you can see the two part story. Part 1 is SEX while Part 2 is Lucia. Hence, the reason for the title.",Sex and Lucía

Maybe if I were a foreign language spectator, I would not notice the actors' mumbling as I read the subtitles, but this film even needs subtitles for a Spanish-speaking person like me. The actors murmur, undress, suffer (and how!) and try to add coherence and credibility to the silly dialogues to no avail.",Sex and Lucía
15,rosscinema,Very mediocre despite sex and nudity,5,2 September 2002,If you take out the sex and nudity in this film what exactly do you have left? A very mediocre story of a writer who takes his work to an unhealthy level and his girlfriend who tries to cope. It's well acted and extremely well photographed but the story really is not that interesting. No wonder they put in so much sex and nudity.,Sex and Lucía
16,philip_vanderveken,There are too many sex scenes in it that don't contribute to the story,6,1 January 2005,"""Lucía y el sexo"" or Sex and Lucía isn't the best example of Spanish cinema. Even though I haven't got any problems with movies that try to be modern fairy tales (for instance Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin) or which have a more philosophical touch (for instance Los amantes del círculo polar), I wasn't really impressed by this one. I couldn't help thinking that this movie was more a porn movie with a huge budget and a more philosophical approach than average. I don't have any problem with sex in a movie, but this time it was a bit too much for me. I haven't timed it, but I guess that I'm not really exaggerating if I say that 30 to 40 % of the movie was made up by gratuitous sex scenes.The movie brings us the story of Lucía and Lorenzo. Lorenzo is a novelist who had a sexual encounter in the past that has a catastrophic effect on his life. Lucía is a woman that is deeply in love with him since she has read his book. She's some kind of stalker but apparently he doesn't feel it that way and he starts a (sexual) relationship with her.Even though the performances of the actors are very good, the movie isn't always as convincing. The ideas of the movie didn't bother me. The fact that a man had a one-night stand and now has to face some consequences is OK. The fact that he's a writer and that he gets his inspiration out of many different impressions and events is very understandable. But I'm sure that the movie's message would have been a lot more powerful if the director had cut a lot of the sex scenes out of it. I now give it a 6/10.",Sex and Lucía

It's a complicated story also, about great feelings with big pretentions. But still you never really get involved. You don't care like you're supposed to. The sex scenes, sometimes including short X-rated sequences, are obviously meant to be sensational. There are however probably body stand-ins in some of them. If anyone is interested.Feelings, rather real people, sorrow and joy. Yes you find it here, but is there life too? I'm not sure.",Sex and Lucía
18,hall895,Round and round it goes...,6,24 July 2011,"Trying to explain this movie's plot is an exercise in futility. It goes around in circles, delights in throwing the viewer completely for a loop. As the movie goes round and round you're left clinging to the hope that this will all get sorted out in the end. It doesn't. When the movie ends you're left questioning everything you have just seen. What did it all mean? Did it mean anything at all? What the heck just happened here? The whole thing is extremely convoluted. Trying to sort it all out may give you a migraine. It's an ambitious effort from director Julio Medem but he never quite manages to get his puzzle to fit together perfectly.Lorenzo is a novelist living in Madrid. Lucia is a big fan of his, veering close to stalker territory. Lorenzo deems it a good idea to have Lucia, whom he has just met and knows absolutely nothing about, move in with him. Lorenzo and Lucia then have sex. Lots and lots of sex. So the movie's title makes sense. The movie itself? There are times where it is very hard to make any sense of it. Lorenzo's writing a new novel and his life and his novel become intertwined to the point it's hard to discern what is real and what is imagined. The movie jumps back and forth in time and in location, going from Madrid to an idyllic island getaway where characters turn out to be connected in very convenient ways in order to keep the story going. The story never goes in a straight line, it's all over the place. If you can't figure it out don't despair because the characters are having a heck of a time figuring it out for themselves. As we watch Lorenzo struggle with his real life and his imagined one we think we may have an advantage because the movie already told us what ultimately happens to Lorenzo way back in the first few minutes. But the way this movie goes round in circles you find that even when you think you know something you don't really know anything at all.It's definitely an intriguing story but it all gets a little too messy. The good bits and pieces don't add up to a satisfying whole. There's much to appreciate but the end result leaves you feeling a bit dazed and probably a bit disappointed. After so much confusion you're left with an ending that's really no ending at all, just raising more questions. And by the time this movie ends the last thing it needs to be doing is raising more questions. Tristán Ulloa as Lorenzo and Paz Vega as Lucia both turn in good performances in the two critical roles and they are ably supported by some other fine performers around them. The fact that the stunningly beautiful Vega is constantly naked certainly doesn't hurt the movie's appeal. She's not the only one spending plenty of time without any clothes on though. When you look at the movie's title the Sex is just as important as the Lucia. The movie probably goes a tad overboard with the sex, a little gratuitous at times. But at least the sex scenes give you moments where you can forget about the convoluted story for a bit. In the end it's that story that ultimately lets down the movie. It's one of those movies that you get the sense is trying to be a little too smart for its own good. The movie makes for interesting but ultimately somewhat frustrating viewing.",Sex and Lucía
19,Rogue-32,It's not about sex. . .,9,15 July 2002,". . .and it's not really even about Lucia! Lucia y el Sexo is actually about Lorenzo, Lucia's novelist boyfriend, and the consequences of a sexual encounter he had in the past which has led to a catastrophic event in his life.  It's a languid and tempestuous poem of a movie, told in a non-linear way by the extremely ambitious Julio Medem.  As a novelist myself, I deeply related to Lorenzo's blurring of reality and imagination. Your characters MUST be real to you in order for them to live and breathe on the page, and so much of your own life goes into the characters that the lines of course do blur.  And then there's the subconscious, which cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality.  Medem understands all this very well, and his depiction of it is remarkable.
 The title, I believe, refers to Lorenzo's past (The Sex and what happened as a result of it), and his present (Lucia). Paz Vega and Tristan Ulloa are stunning as the two leads - Vega with her fierce intelligence and Ulloa with his tormented vulnerability.  I would have given this film a 10 if it hadn't been for the fact that the most pivotal scene is shot in an incredibly vague manner, which left me confused as to what had actually happened until much later in the movie, but it is a brilliant and heartfelt experience nonetheless.",Sex and Lucía
20,itamarscomix,I don't buy it,5,2 June 2012,"One thing that can never be said about ""Sex and Lucia"" is that it's not interesting. It has a unique look and feel, more than almost any Spanish film I've seen, and also some very memorable and enticing scenes. The first thirty minutes work quite well as a slightly surreal relationship-based drama. The more it goes on, though, the more the plot twists and turns, and as much as I wanted to believe that it was all leading up to something, or that there was a substantial layer of subtext, I found myself not caring too much, and I got a strong feeling that Medem was deliberately making it more obscure and incoherent than it has to be for the sake of creating an artistic visage to cover for the fact that he didn't really have anything much to say.Some films bend and break genre conventions to create truly fascinating art; some films decide to ignore plot and coherency in favor of atmosphere and symbolism. ""Sex and Lucia"", unfortunately, doesn't do any of that. It does have quite intense atmosphere, and probably some layers of symbolism I couldn't be bothered to look for, but it just failed to capture me in any meaningful way. I was impressed with all the elements - gorgeous shots, good dialog and excellent acting - but it doesn't come together to create a real film, and it's too long and too heavy-handed to be enjoyed merely as a collection of individual scenes. Worst of all, it's not even about Lucia, nor is it about sex. It's about unlikable Lorenzo and figuring out what on earth Lucia sees in him. That's almost as big a mystery as what the film is actually about.",Sex and Lucía
21,LeRoyMarko,The story that never ends,7,14 November 2004,"At time beautiful, at time confusing like hell, this movie is worth watching. I must admit it caught me off-guard. I guess I was expecting another ""Y tu mama tambien"", for some reason. But this one is closer to ""Adaptation."" Lorenzo is consumed with his novel. Reality and fiction become all tangled. Confused, I identify with a previous user that said that he wanted to like the movie, but found it difficult. As for the sex scenes, they're passionate, pure, some could even say beautiful. There's nothing wrong with that. I enjoyed both performances by Paz Vega (Lucía) and Tristán Ullea (Lorenzo), but it's Elena Anaya (Belen) who steals the show. She's sublime in her role. As for the ""the never ending"" theme, I suspect the director used it to clear away a lot of guessing that people might have watching his film.Out of 100, I gave it 75. That's good for **½ out of ****.Seen at home, in Toronto, on November 13th, 2004.",Sex and Lucía
22,khatcher-2,There are two ways to do everything: the easy way and the Spanish way,7,3 October 2003,"Which is perhaps the reason why Spaniards are winning motor-cycle Grand Prix, Formula 1 Gran Prix, Football competitions, Basketball championships, Golf Tournaments, World Tennis Tournaments, 1,500 metre races, Grammys, Emmys, the odd Oscar now and again, but without much success in the Eurovision Song Contest in recent years ........ So Julio Medem takes this complicated formula one step - or more - further and comes up with a somewhat lop-sided involuted story, which, if you like, might be classified as a love story, or, if you like not, might be classified as a sex story. In either case you would be missing the point.As with `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar' (qv), Julio Medem opts for seemingly disjointed narrative, jumping back and forth, but not in a two-dimensional sense, but rather in an umpteen-dimensional sense. Thus he carries to the nth degree erratic manoeuvres between the now and the then and other intermediary points, such that if the explicit sex has not put off your concentration too much you might well follow what is, in effect, an intriguing story, with all its bizarre ennui attached. Once again, linking up the out-of-sequence scenes is not for those more intent on finishing off their pop-corn or wondering whether the boyfriend/girlfriend is going to hold her/his hand before the film gets too far on.Bringing together Paz Vega, Elena Anaya and Javier Cámara so that they would be ready for `Hable con Ella' (qv) and adding Najwa Nimri after her excellent results in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', Medem throws into the mix Tristán Ulloa and conjures up a horrifyingly painful story of glorious love and frenzied sex. But I insist that the sexual inferences are not the point but only the vehicle for carrying the story forward - with its overly frequent jumps backward - so that all the ends can be neatly tied up, or apparently so, so as to reach what is, in the last few minutes, the foreseeable happy ending. The whole point of the film is, as far as I am aware, to portray the young modern woman today who wants - craves - her bit of good sex as much as any man does, and we do not need served-up macho interpretations to be convinced of it. Evidently, Medem, as Almodóvar, has a good hand with the ladies, and this film puts such asseveration beyond doubt. What I question is whether such blatantly explicit sex scenes were necessary for getting the point across, especially as it would seem that Medem is aiming at audiences whose intellectual appetite is somewhat higher than `Notting Hill', say, or `You've got Mail', say. Such supposed audience would or should have enough imagination to carry him/her through such scenes. But today everything is served up straight, on a plate, and dished out accordingly, symptomatic of today's idealistic `unique thinking'.But Medem defies such straight-jacket ways of doing things. As in `Los Amantes del Círculo Polar', here what might be called happenstance or fortuitous casualties, brings together a number of people on the Balearic island of Formentera, in such a way that the link up between them should help you along through the out-of-sequence scenes. The symbolic thread is the moon - thus the little girl is called 'Luna'. Medem uses this concept very appropriately, creating dialogues to carry forward the idea and putting visual images into great use so as to help the story-line along. Perfectly orchestrated by Alberto Iglesias, in consonance with Kiko de la Rica's excellent photography, the whole is rather like a choreographed tableau, as if only the skates and ice were missing.I recommend this film for viewers who can grasp the essentials of abstract, sometimes fantasious symbolisms and has a clear mind on the rôle of primeval sex as a driving force in women - as well as men.",Sex and Lucía

The beginning of the movie seemed to establish some beautiful cinematography and direction, but this seemed to taper off as the movie wore on.The picture does have a considerable amount of sex, much of it more graphic than I am used to seeing in all but genuinely pornographic movies.   If that sort of thing offends you, be forewarned. I don't consider this pornographic - and the sex didn't strike me as gratuitous.The direction was good and the acting was certainly acceptable.  I think the biggest failing was the excess of coincidence in the plot.  There was no attempt to explain how some of the character's paths crossed.  The character development was interesting enough that the plot weaknesses didn't fail the movie as a whole.",Sex and Lucía
26,diand_,Meta-story and story,7,24 July 2005,"This is one of the better structured movies ever put to screen. It's as complex as Lynch's Lost Highway, but that only adds to the experience. A non-linear structure (in time and space) is applied and Lucia y el Sexo blurs the line between reality and imagination.Basically, it's like Mulholland Drive: Most of what we see is a dream, imagination. Only a relatively small part did really happen. But this goes one step further: What part is in the eye of the beholder here, because little clues are given so the mystery format is only used to keep us entertained at a basic level.A writer is the center here. Some parts of his life are probably true (trouble at home, sickness), others are ambiguous, others are certainly imagined. He is in the meta-story, but also places himself in threads in the other stories that come from his imagination. His imagination is formed by applying smaller and larger events (meeting a person at a party, seeing someone in front of the house) in his personal life to his fantasies. His erotic fantasies explain the title, as sex is one of the characters of the story. One of the story lines is again about his script read on the island by one of his imagined characters. Writing the story and telling the story is done simultaneously. As he becomes sick, the characters become helpless in the story. Overall it helps a lot if you keep imagining that you're watching imagined characters being manipulated by the writer. This combines meta-story and story, real with imagination, weaving several threads in a complicated web of story lines. In the end, it is made clear that the story doesn't end but starts again halfway, giving further evidence that viewers can use their imagination at random on this and create their own story out of it.The meta-story is interesting, but by mixing it with the story itself we see the real story as what it is, a writing trick with imagined characters. That unfortunately diminishes the emotions a movie tries to convey. We're merely watching how a movie is structured, with the imagined story not having the usual dramatic impact.It's remarkable that so many people are offended by the sex scenes, as it's already in the title. Do they also complain about the presence of aliens in Alien? I found the sex scenes to be made with some honesty; and at least they didn't even shy away of male nudity.",Sex and Lucía
27,howie73,Overlong,5,5 March 2006,"A major disappointment from Medem, Sex and Lucia is an overlong and annoying art house film with a plot as flimsy as cappuccino froth. The film's penchant for magic realism clouds any coherent backstory, resulting in a jumbled and boring, self-indulgent dissertation on paternal guilt and the creative process. The photography resembles many a stylish advert for perfume and feels strained and self-consciously stylised to such a degree that it is hard to feel any connection to the convoluted story Medem presents. The actors do a fine job with the jumbled script and I am amazed they even knew what was going on but none of them elicits our sympathy. I was also annoyed by the simplistic symbolism of the sun and the moon which was overdone by Medem in many scenes. A little subtlety should have been employed with these symbols. Another unconvincing theme was the contention that literature and reality are somehow interchangeable, to the point where reality can somehow be rewritten to relive guilt and tragedy. I'm baffled why the film was called Sex and Lucia since the real theme is Writing and Death; and Lucia herself is not really the creative force of the film. The story takes you in one direction only to abandon any sense of logic in the name of writing and creativity.",Sex and Lucía

The sex scenes are explicit, but it is not overdone. If you came to watch the hot sex scenes, that's great, but they only last may 20 seconds max and the point isn't really the sex as the movie title might imply, but the consequences of it. The sentiment attached to it and how lives can be interwoven unknowingly through this natural human desire, through lust. It's really a deep movie if you get past the skin-deep elements of it, and the cinematography, acting and script are quite beautiful. Another complex element of the film is the fine line between reality and fantasy, fact and fiction, and that's something else that draws the viewer in - what really happens in the story and what doesn't?

It offers a straightforward story of love, fate and happenstance. Sex and Lucia is very different and much, much deeper. The sex of the title and the sex on screen inevitably confuse an American audience stuck in the 17th century of their pilgrim forbears.

With this film, it was no exception; the moment the credits appeared and I left the theater my feet felt like I was floating over the ground.This spanish auteur, has showed us throughout time, that he is able to wake up even the most hidden feelings from us and play with them as the pieces of the puzzles that are his movies are set together like in ""vacas"", ""la ardilla roja"" and most greatly in ""los amantes del circulo polar"".
What call my attention the most is that, I have the feeling that Medem tried to get away from his past with this story but ended up coming back to it, which is a great thing in the sense that the poetry and melancholy that is always present in his movies, are also part of this one.The main question regarding the film is, What does ""Lucia y el sexo"" mean?, what is the correlation between what happens and the actual ritual of sex? You have to see it to get a conclusion...Is it love?, lust?, loss of innocence?, or just a part of the human condition? To get an idea, you have to let yourself go along the images and surely you might find the answer at the end.One more thing, who wouldn´t fall in love with someone like Lucia?

37,Euphorbia,Give it a chance -- or two,7,2 October 2004,"I watched this movie on DVD the first time, kept wanting to like it, but couldn't. It seemed disjointed and wantonly shuffled, like a dismantled jigsaw puzzle. Elena's pointed gesture at the story printout near the end finally made clear to me that the movie's resemblance to a Klein bottle (a 4-dimensional moebius strip whose neck opens back into its center) was intended, not accidental. In other words, it was not my fault that I could not follow the story, but rather the director's purpose that I should not. Why he chose this structure still eludes me, but there it is.I thought about this afterwards, baffled because the performances were excellent, yet the overall effect was both annoying and disappointing. My gut reaction was to rate it low (5/10) because the chopped up structure was so distracting, yet this seemed unfair because many of the elements were really good. I watched the DVD again the next night. Already knowing the story made a tremendous difference -- along with realizing from the beginning that the ""mermaid"" is not Lucia, which on a cinema-size screen would possibly have been obvious, but was not obvious on my monitor. I found the structure a lot clearer, and could really savor the terrific performances, particularly by the three women. Most remarkable of this first-rate ensemble is Elena Anaya (Belen) who is in the same class as Audrey Hepburn. She doesn't get much dialog, and doesn't need it. She conveys every nuance of her beguiling but sinister character by glance, expression, and gesture, that all come across perfectly with or without subtitles. Ethereally beautiful, forthrightly erotic, sweetly innocent, dangerously demented -- that's Belen. Her wordless reaction to ""first and last"" is one of the most memorable such scenes in cinema, and most actors will never come close to equaling it. ** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS **There is one thing about this movie that I disliked the first time, and that I positively came to hate the second time. This was the color design. It was dreadful. Its rationale was ""explained"" in one of the DVD interviews, but its being intentional made it even worse than if it had merely been a technical glitch. Sex and Lucia was shot on 24P HD video, which allowed free manipulation of the color palette anywhere in the movie. The problem was that Medem and his team used this new power recklessly -- and did so in every single scene. The net result was that most of the movie looks as if it had been shot on outdated Ektachrome, developed at Photomat, and then left out in the sun for a few months. Hint to budding directors: For emotive color manipulation to work, there must be a baseline of realistic color that one moves away from -- or it will come across as a mistake. Moreover the shift into abstract or emotion-based color must happen organically, without calling attention to itself.Peter Jackson did this masterfully in Lord of the Rings (explained in the DVD appendix to the Fellowship of the Ring). Jean-Pierre Jeunet did it even better in Amelie. Wayne Wang did it reasonably well in Center of the World (also shot on video, like Sex and Lucia). But Medem, alas, got swept up in the novelty of this technology, so that it is constantly obtrusive and distracts from his story. Medem set up two artificial color schemes for this film, one for Madrid, the other for the island. These were further varied by whether a particular scene was past or present. But the schemes did not differ sufficiently from each other to make it clear where or when a scene was unfolding, while they all differed so much from real color and light that the color grading became a barrier between the story and the audience. Overall rating 7/10 -- with possible further revision upward.*If you like Sex & Lucia, you might also like: Romance, by Catherine BreillatCenter of the World, by Wayne WangSummer Lovers, by Randall KleiserA Girl in a Swing, book by Richard Adams",Sex and Lucía

Clearly the movie review I heard was also a little confused!Instead, I was really pleasantly surprised to find out that this was actually a really good, if somewhat unacategoriseable film! I mean there was humour, there was drama, there was defintely some plot twists, obviously some sex scenes and it was thoroughly engaging all the way through! I had to laugh though, although many complain about the gratuitous female nudity, this film did slip with the editing of the male nudity, making that seem gratuitous - but in an era where all the Hollywood actress spend half a movie naked and having sex with fully clothed men, it was nice just to see some male nudity (when was the last time you saw a post-80s Hollywood movie with as much male bare chest as in Ben Hur?!)!Its very hard to write about this movie in depth - the plot does twist a lot - clearly evident by some of the reviews indicating the reviewer was defintely confused. I suspect this is because the premise of the film was to write a story where if you didn't like the ending, there was an escape hatch to return to the middle - which it did. However, the actors in this movie are so good, and the character development is excellent so that its hard not to get swept up in the gorgeous filming and unfolding plot.

46,shengyang,Porn and plot holes,2,17 July 2003,"There is nothing to like about this movie. Even the much talked about sex scenes start to get boring, since they are so gratuitous and repetitive. The film is poorly scripted and none of the psychological reactions of the characters ring true. No one could take seriously the character of Lorenzo the novelist who writes such juvenile autobiographical stories. And what about the plot holes and loose ends? Why the hell does the family dog suddenly attack the young girl, with whom it had lived for years? What purpose does it serve to leave open the fate of the babysitter, her mother and Carlos (who literally disappears down a hole)? The movie tries to be deep, but fails embarrassingly.",Sex and Lucía
47,heather1252,Artsy bordering on melodrama,8,3 March 2002,"Extremely well directed film with superb performances by the three lead women that fails miserably. The film has no dramatic tension due to a lackluster male lead that generates no interest: He is neither intellectual enough nor sexy enough. He projects no angst or even a healthy dash of true grit for the role he is required to play (young Antonio Banderas sorely missed here). It is difficult to see why three stunning women with great personalities are/were involved with him. The middle lags considerably, in particular the relationship between Lucia and Lorenzo that marches straight to a dead end, going nowhere other than circles. Towards the grand finale, a clever plot carries the day as the three stories converge. Sex is gorgeously photographed but plain, perhaps too caste in feeling, in fact most of it is boring,  possibly because of the lack in dramatic tension (very far from the heat accomplished by masters like Nicholas Roeg). The ending is perhaps one of the most thoroughly disappointing ones in Spanish cinema, a complete cop-out, turning a could-be classic mood piece into cheap melodrama that can be forgotten in a few hours.  Wait for the video release if you must see it.",Sex and Lucía

The less sensical, the better. Now I like touching, moving and whimsical fare. And romance.I have been seeing a lot more Spanish cinema lately and and I'm appreciating it more and more. Sometimes thought-provoking, always touching and rarely in-your-face. Pretty much the opposite of what has been going on lately in Hollywood.(possible spoilers: you've been warned!)Sex and Lucía is the story of how lives unknowingly intersect. An author hit by a car, his girlfriend, the owner of a Bed and Breakfast on an island, a deep-sea diver. All their lives are linked to each other, but none knows it or why. All the answers are on the island.That's it, plotwise. Go see it if you want to understand what I'm talking about: I like to give as little detail about the plot as possible. Make it a surprise.I found the performances of the actors to be top-notch. You can see the evolution of Lucía and Lorenzo's relationship over the course of the movie. You see and feel the strain and the desperation slowly setting in. You see and feel the pain of the mother when her child meets an untimely death. It's all there. No wonder it got nominated for a number of Goyas (Spain's equivalent of the Oscars).Plus, there is beautiful camera work. Spaniards really know how to make their country shine on film.This is the first work I've seen from director Julio Medem, but it definitely will not be the last.

The story touches the far reaches of pure joy and contentment as well as tragedy, profound loss, and deep suffering. Paz Vega is bold yet vulnerable, and shows an amazing range as a very spontaneous woman who has an intense relationship with a man that suddenly disappears, leading her to escape to an island and search her memory and her surroundings for clues to her lover's past. The music and photography both leave huge impressions, notably the underwater shots that depict sex, conception, birth, and life.

The afore-mentioned movies, in my opinion reflected limited directorial skills and zero originality.So, he ""moves into the 2000s"" with a movie in which you see a constant parade of genitals followed by sex.  If you like naked bodies and uncensored sex, go for it by all means.  However, don't try to pass it off as ""transcendental"" or ""artistic"" like Medem did.There is no plot.  None.  You get more of a plot swirling a bowl of alphabet soup with your spoon.

53,tezzzaaa,"beautifully, wildly, mysteriously explicit and implicit",9,14 November 2002,"With Lucia y el sexo Julio Medem draws on a lot of his familiar themes. Destiny,coincidence and fate alternating courses during people's lives. He also handled love and memories as important drives of people. Children tend to portray people's consciousness, with their fresh and honest innocence. As Luna's fate in this movie both infects and cleanses Salvador, taking him through his past and present.Medem also likes to use nature to symbolize stages and feelings in his character's lives. The moon, soil, water and fish all come back repeatedly, each with a different meaning. This gives the movie a beautiful dreamy atmosphere, strongly backed up by the camera work.Now to the sex in the movie. It's very strong from the beginning, but besides it's explicitness Medem also deals with it very sensitively. The sex is arousing but meaningful too. Anyone who's been in a passionate relationship must be touched by Salvador and Lucia's sex life, leading toward an almost dangerous addiction. I wondered if the rest of their relationship was strong enough to pass the test of time though, sex seemed to be at the core of their love. Some of the sex scenes were very aesthetically directed and filmed. The cunnilingus scene on this symphony-like music was classic! It's definitely the best oral sex scene I've ever seen on film. Arousing with a smile. I was also happy to see that the UK-version of the video was uncut, showing the male organs. Very refreshing that men are also portrayed vulnerably in a movie. The sex is much stronger and important in the first part of the film. That was functionable in the story as the characters saturate themselves in it, leading to problems, but somehow to me it also felt unbalanced.Julio Medem has really made a beautiful film with Lucia y el sexo. I found it profoundly moving and captivating. You have to let yourself be carried away though or you might become saturated yourself, with the abundance of symbolism and sex.",Sex and Lucía

You feel pain when you lose your lover, and it's a great pleasure to see him (or her) alive. Thus sex doesn't bring only pleasure to Lucia. It's something that brings her pain. What is there between a human and sex? You know there are always extensions to sex. E.g. your friends accompany you in you life and they can help you overcome any difficulties. The life of simple people can be so sensual! Paz Vega is very beautiful and this is a role for her, however Tristán Ulloa with his blond hair doesn't look Spanish.

56,ColonelHetzer217,Pretentious Spanish version of the Emmanuelle films.,2,26 March 2019,"Pros: Plenty of real sexual activity & nudity to please softcore fans.
Cons: Otherwise this is even more pretentious than the Emmanuelle franchise.The Story:
After receiving a phone call from the police about her boyfriend's car accident, Spanish waitress Lucia quits her job & makes her way to a strange remote island where she has several strange encounters, many of which border on the fantasy side of things, some of which are erotic.With Sex & Lucia, Spanish director Julio Medem made a surprisingly successful Spanish softcore fantasy that made a healthy profit & earned several awards. Which is pretty surprising given that this film is essentially the cheapjack Spanish version of the infamous French softcore series of Emmanuelle, only a good deal cheaper & more pretentious than its source material. Sex & Lucia is the type of film that those pretentious socialist arthouse types like to watch & get thrilled by while the rest of us real folk like action & horror films. Those same socialist types decry action & horror films as garbage that rot people's minds while not being capable of realising that the real mind-rot comes & decline in morality comes from watching boring romantic comedies & films like Sex & Lucia, which has about as much watchability as the ridiculously popular & utterly trashy content-free garbage TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, although if I were to choose between the two, I'll go with Sex & Lucia purely because it has plenty of nudity in it (that shot of Paz Vega walking along a beach totally starkers is a masterpiece of softcore fantasy shots) & at least you know what you're getting yourself into. We normal folks are excited by violence while the arthouse crowd are excited by sex - indeed Sex & Lucia is pretty much their version of something like First Blood, only with Sly Stallone replaced by some feisty Spanish broad with a great body.The story of Sex & Lucia is pretty much non-existent, as well as being filled with more flowery nonsense than the entirety of the Emmanuelle series put together but with a Spanish flavour to it. All it is consists of a woman who thinks that her boyfriend is dead & therefore quits her job & moves to some mysterious island where weird things happen. Along the way, she discovers herself, blah, blah, blah. Truth be told, I only sought this out for the nudity & at least in that respect I wasn't disappointed - probably because I fast-forwarded through the boring parts (of which there are many) & stopped only at any shot of the drop-dead-gorgeous Paz Vega in all her birthday suit glory. There is a scene of Vega & her boyfriend stripping in front of each other while dancing at the same time to a dirty song that is hilarious to watch, as is the dream sequence where Vega strips off all her clothes & lies down on a muddy beach next to a mud-covered man who promptly covers her in mud. On a technical standpoint, the film is crudely shot on what appears to be a cheap camcorder - the colour balance is sometimes out of whack, as well as being washed out most of the time - and the soundtrack has the occasional wind shear to it. This isn't an intellectual picture by any means & the lack of a real plot makes the film hard to follow for much of the running time but if you want cheap gratuitous nudity but are not in the mood to rewatch the Emmanuelle series again, then try it.",Sex and Lucía
57,svetaaniston,Fine movie,8,28 May 2003,"Lucia y el sexo is a fine movie. First of all, the movie is funny, smart, and daring. Some things in the script were a bit hard to understand (I think if you watch it a second time, things become clearer, and besides - what's the use of a movie that doesn't keep you guessing?) but because of the humor and speed of the narration, it didn't distract me at all from the general feeling of esthetical satisfaction I had while watching this movie. The locations are very nice and the actors are well-cast. Especially Lucia (Paz Vega) is defintely impressive (and not only in the nude-scenes!) People who watch movies for a 'correct' plot only, should not watch this movie, I guess. Stick to Agatha Christie murder-mysteries or so. For sure, they will not leave you pondering over life's mysteries.This movie does. It makes you think while leaving you with a good feeling at that.",Sex and Lucía

I couldn't tell who was who some of time and didn't want to at others. While the movie has beautiful cinematography and is effective it is emotionally wrenching. that's good if you like that sort of head-job.

59,georgiain,Heavy handed symbolism and contortionist plot,6,23 July 2004,"What is sex and Lucia all about?  This isn't as clear from the title as it would seem and after churning it over nothing gets any clearer.  Sex does appear, quite frequently, and links many of the characters together but the film isn't all about sex.  In fact sex is unembarrassing, pleasurable and regret free and although it appears often it seems simply to be presented as a fact of life.  Unfortunately everything else seems to be part of a dizzying metaphor in a cyclical plot.  Unless deconstructing convoluted narratives is your thing this can be a problem.  Lucia is a waitress who follows and seduces Lorenzo an author who writes books about passionate encounters and into cycle we go. Couplings, fantasies and melodramas unfold, events mirror each other, and the timeline twists and turns on itself and in the end (it all gets very metaphysical) I think Medem tries to tell us that imagination makes reality what we will.  What's real and what is invention becomes irrevocably blurred (is this the point?).  The symbolism becomes heavy handed, even the holiday island that the characters revolve around itself is almost not an island, criss-crossed by subterranean sea caves where one can enter at one point and emerge at another and fantastically rocks in stormy weather.Despite the maturity and tenderness with which the love scenes are treated, the heavy handed symbolism and contortionist plot work to throw off any emotional intensity that the acting and powerful soundtrack can build.  It ends up being too clever to exercise any real intelligence.",Sex and Lucía

It has some sex, a lot of dialogue, pretty people, not so much detail as for the environment it has been shot in. I think it deserves a 7 for complexity and especially for it is a Spanish film, which isn't very advanced compared to French or German productions.

62,bitterstranger,"Slick and clever, but a bit too contrived to be genuinely engaging",5,19 November 2004,"Stories told in a so-called ""magical realism"" style like this film can be very tricky. The story and the characters need to be very strong to sustain all the twists of the plot and I don't think this was pulled off here. I was disappointed, as I'd enjoyed Medem's previous film Los Amantes del Circulo Polar, where the passionate love story seemed a lot more genuine and the tragic ending seemed to fit better with the theme of fate playing with people's lives than Lucia y el sexo's tragic-to-happy contortions. Also, while the female characters were all charming and sexy, the male roles were really poor and unconvincing. What on earth did Lucia see in Lorenzo? There isn't enough to justify her endurance and patience with him. Their whole love story seems artificial from the inception, it seems there was too much work on the symbolism of their relationship - the tormented writer and storyteller, the reader and savior (Lucia as a ray of sunshine) - rather than on the real intensity of feeling between two people. The sex scenes are too stylish and sleek to be really passionate. Everyone is good looking and well dressed, they live in nice apartments, exist in a bubble where the society around them doesn't seem to affect them, this is obviously purposefully so and ideally you wouldn't mind that lack of realism if the story was engrossing enough, which it isn't. The entire plot seems to revolve around the concept of the ability to deal with tragic fateful events by rewriting, literally and metaphorically, one's own life story. But the final optimism comes across as too artificial. The plot does not resolve the fate of the child Luna, Lorenzo's daughter. The tragedies seem more like a prop, a trick to demonstrate how love can conquer guilt, remorse and failure. They're not given enough weight. People slash their wrists or throw themselves under buses easier than they cry, then we're supposed to believe they can just forget and forgive and live happily ever after. The director says he wanted to make everything ""light"" in this film, after the experience with the previous one. But I think he overdid it! There is a bit too much of the French 'Amelie' in Lucia's character, she is more like a beautiful fairy than a real person. Elena, too, is more a symbol of caring and nurturing (motherhood, cooking, taking care of Lucia) than a real grieving mother. Her lack of anger and bitterness is not very believable. The whole escapist symbol of the floating island becomes annoying after a while. It functions on the characters like a drug inducing apathy and oblivion, more of a way of avoiding pain than confronting it. But it's not that, it's the way in which it's presented and wrapped up at the end that really disappoints - too fancy and too abstract to really work.It's not a bad film. It's full of eye candy - the spectacularly gorgeous Paz Vegas, the island, the photography - and it is well directed and well acted overall. But without all that, the story itself wouldn't really be worth much.",Sex and Lucía

But everything is in his place, creating a unity of harmony and beauty that goes directly to your soul and heart. But it´s not only the plot... it´s the way Medem puts it in images that makes his films unique. The cinematography of Kiko de la Rica, the music of Alberto Iglesias and the light of Formentera submerge the viewer in the feelings and sensations of the main characters, which are excellently played by all the cast, specially by Najwa Ninri and Tristan Ulloa, who seems to be Julio Medem´s alter ego. I think there is a lot of truth and sincerity in this film, perhaps the one in which Medem more exposes himself to the public, talking about him. And... what about sex?

67,mycranium,Director sacrifices character development for gratuitous sex (minor spoilers),6,6 June 2003,"There are two major problems with this movie. One is that a large amount of time is devoted to gratuitous sex scenes between Lucia and Lorenzo. Delightful as they may be, by the time Lucia is walking out on Lorenzo, there has been very little in the film to demonstrate that the bond between them is based on anything besides Lorenzo's acquiescence to Lucia's sexual aggressiveness. Lucia's initial contact with Lorenzo is the result of the fantasies she has about him based on his novel, which implies a delusional state of mind (not to mention her stalker behavior). I have nothing against on-screen sex nor against sexually aggressive women, but there was so little emotional connection between them established in the film that I had trouble buying that they had been together for six months, let alone several years. Besides, who keeps the same bad haircut for six years? Lorenzo, that's who.The other problem is the swarming mass of coincidence that brings all the players together on the island. The coincidences start early (Pepe's sister somehow knows the mother of Lorenzo's daughter) and Medem keeps piling them on until they're so thick it's ridiculous. It may be argued that this phenomenon is a result of the vague notion that the movie is about the intersection of reality and fiction, but that sounds to me more like a lame rationalization after the fact than a deliberately employed storytelling device. It feels self indulgent, even lazy from a writing standpoint.Okay, make that three major problems: the assertion that the story has a hole where one can enter at the end and re-emerge in the middle and possibly change the outcome is bogus. If it is to be believed then most of the movie must be regarded as nothing more than a pessimistic fantasy played out in the head of a writer. Remember the infamous season of ""Dallas?"" Medem declared that he wanted to make this film more uplifting and optimistic than ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle."" Could he only achieve this through the use of such an artificial deus ex machina? Medem seems to be going for magical realism, but he merely emulates its superficial qualities. A lot of sex, some washed-out photography, quirky characters and a bunch of unbelievable coincidences may add up to a hypnotic fable for some. For me it's all condiment and no entree.Medem is reputed to have rehearsed this thing for 5 months. In my opinion he should have either spent longer and come up with a more credible script, or he should have made the movie much more quickly. Some sense of spontaneity would have been welcome in this ponderous lack-of-character drama.",Sex and Lucía

Their mutual passion for each other is shown by Bedem in all of its intensity and playfulness, its insecurities, its warmth and eventually the sexual detachment of Lorenzo due to a trauma which he cannot speak of to Lucia. Some scenes are very bold and imaginative, such as someone imitating a sex film, or a penis growing before your eyes while a man massages a woman. But eventually the deep sentimental connections between the characters are laid out, and some may find all the sentimentality as jarring as the sex. Bedem is a confident filmmaker, and he paces the unraveling of his story in such a way to keep the viewer interested in some aspect of the mystery of Lorenzo. More than simply visually frank, the sex in the film really goes a long way in painting the characters of the film and the relationships between the characters engaged in sexuality, and even those outside of the act. The actors, for the most part, played roles of often complex and enigmatic characters (such is the nature of the narrative) with enough depth to keep you interested in them. Paz Vega played Lucia's passionate character with much effectiveness, even when the role or the lines she was given seemed at times to be made somewhat clunky or exaggerated. While I often found the film to be overly sentimental, this is certainly another unique and adventurous work by Bedem, whose other film I have seen is The Red Squirrel. It plays with the interaction between fiction and life, between past and present, physical connection and metaphysical connection, bringing you into a world where they all blend together in one island brought together by love, sex, and death.",Sex and Lucía

One of them has this intricate, nonlinear plot to it, which weaves itself around to some sort of satisfaction, but not necessarily an end, just a hole, which will take you where you want to go.  The other movie is more symbolic, about fantasy and contrast and women and men and lights and darknesses.  Also, it's about writing.  I don't want to give away too much, but it reminded me a lot of that Escher drawing of two hands that are drawing one another.

As opposed to what some people may think, I believe that all the sex scenes, although they are pretty explicit, are totally necessary in order to tell the story and to show the characters just as they are. It's a movie to really think about and it goes from what it seems a twisted story full of rather weird elements to a (if you wanna see it in that way) sweet and simple love story.

Since it is always there, as the air they breathe, sex never seems to exert any decisive influence either on the plot or on the psychological development of the characters - it just feeds lines to them.I must admit, though, that -to the best of my recollection- never so many explicit sex scenes were shown in a film without letting it slip into the realm of dull hard-core. Forget all about ""Baise Moi"" or ""Romance X""! This one delivers!I would venture to say that the one thing this film is all about is... literature and the hold a story can get on author, reader and characters, and how all of them interplay and shape different planes of reality. The way I see it, this is the film's most ambitious intellectual pursuit, and a very ambitious one at that!

But even though parts of the film could nearly be categorized as soft-core porn, you'll honestly nearly forget it - because you'll be overwhelmed by the incredibly breathtaking scenery and the intermingling story lines.  It flashes around quite a bit (think Memento-style) but you're not confused at all!

I appreciated a lot of the artistic elements and the various themes entwined and even the sex and intimacy felt more real, but the dog scene left a distaste, and from here on I lost more and more interest.If the story kept to less themes and had more continuity then I would have appreciated it more, however it was over-complicated.

It is so contrived upto the point that the viewer feels that he is neglected in constructing the storyline. Too many snobbish metaphors, ambiguities and subtleties leave the audience uncaptivated. As the story goes on, I feel more and more disengaged, thanks to its pretentious taste. My tipping point is the dog scene. First, the writer doesn't have to kill the child. Even if he has to, it doesn't have to be by a dog. If it has to be a dog (another distasteful metaphor, yes I get it), the scene doesn't have to be shot in such an overly unnecessarily confusing way.

At times you will wonder what is reality and what is the fiction within the fiction. Simply put, it is a great ride in the journey of the creative process.

You are definitely moved and excited.  Yes, you get excited...admit it. I have never seen such an explicit film that was so raw, yet romantic and pure.  It was so forbidden but adventurous.  I have seen a lot of foreign film that have raw sex, but this one...took the show.

If you believe this movie was even remotely entertaining than you may have been tricked by a talent less writer. The movie twisted and turned so much that I found myself carefully paying attention to every little detail only to realize that when the film ended absolutely nothing was accomplished. The writer twisted the order and events of the movie because he can't write. I imagine most viewers will be so overwhelmed by the ever changing events and they won't actually sit back to realize this film was a complete and total waste of time.

I think, that this film, abuse the sex scenes to attract the spectators and there are almost always unnecessary. An other abuses are the burned photography in the scenes at the island. Why they meaning?, it is abusive at all. When I read the summary, of that film, in the DVD, it explain that this film is about Lucia discovery of her own past, and that it isn't true, in any case it would be about her boyfriend.

One of the best of this year Spanish films (The others suck). I would only say, that the title of the film, doesn't suggest the more accurate idea of what the film is about, instead of Lucia y el sexo, it should be called ""Lucia y la isla"" or just ""La Isla"" because i think the island is the character that ""puts"" all the characters together.

94,zackp,Amazing film,10,23 December 2004,"""Sex and Lucia"" is simply a fantastic film. Julio Medem's complex tale forces the viewer's full attention immediately, and one must remain focused to follow and unravel the wonderful scenarios that continue to take place. Many people comment primarily on the vivid sex scenes in the film, and the sensuality of the film is certainly a vital part; but if one focuses solely on this aspect so much beauty of the film will be overlooked. This is not only one the most captivating love stories in cinema's vast history (as is Medem's ""Lovers of the Arctic Circle""), but the near perfection of story and acting are equaled and at times even surpassed by the mesmerizing cinematography. This is one the most gorgeous films ever put to celluloid. This film gets the highest vote possible from me and I encourage anyone of age to explore its themes and narrative. And if at the core of it all, you are simply looking for racy, creative sex scenes, then look no further. ""Sex and Lucia"" has some of the best ones ever, with so much more to offer as well.",Sex and Lucía

That, to me,  is part of the beauty of the creation: i want to see it again, i need to see it again.
It is so easy to have the wish to see it again. The characters are so beautiful. The passionate way they live their intense lifes. Or is it the other way around: the intensity in which they live their passions? The scenes of nature are incredible, the colors. The cleverness and originality with which everything has been created.I cannot recall a movie that has had such an impact on me when i was watching it.

97,swarat,"profound, beautiful, visceral",10,26 May 2003,"SPOILER ALERT Sex and Lucia is one of those movies that will grab me and won't let go. I saw it with the fascination a child has for her bedtime tale, I connect to it with my soul and viscera. The movie speaks of an island where one can change the course of one's life, an island that floats like a raft atop the sea, that is so full of caves as to be nearly hollow, so that each of the many holes you may fall into is really a tunnel that will take you somewhere else. This is the island of Lorenzo the writer, Lucia's boyfriend.But to start at the start. Lorenzo's first book told the story of a birthday boy who had made love to a stranger on a full moon night in the ocean. He is having a writer's block while writing his second. Lucia and he become lovers after Lucia meets him at a coffeeshop and tells him she is in love with him and wants to live with him. In parallel, we see a daughter being born from Lorenzo's nameless union. In time, in his second novel, Lorenzo will have to face his child, named Luna after the full moon. His agent gives him the plot of this story, where Luna is born and he finds her in a park, and this leads to a house where a man lives with two women, and there is torment, passion, suffocation, lust. Lorenzo gets to spend a night with his child only if he succumbs to the lust of sexy au pair Belen; in an unforgettable scene he tells a bedtime story to his daughter in a bedroom furnished as if it's underwater, just as Belen dresses herself up for seduction. Luna dies before Lorenzo can tell her that he is her father, but this death has to be a secret too. Lorenzo is dragged into a relentless trajectory of secrets, depression, sleeping pills, and knows that he has to either kill Belen and her mother, and set himself free, or kill himself.At all points of the movie, the characters of Lorenzo's fiction interact with and exist as real human beings; we see their lives change as Lorenzo types away at his computer, but they are also free agents. This means the film works at two layers. One can treat Lorenzo's passions, his infidelities, his child, the deaths, the sex, as real, and have a consistent interpretation. But true meaning comes from the layer above, where we actually live within a writer's mind, and see how events here coexist with, and are influenced by, thinks that ""really"" happen to the writer. Metaphor merges with reality, fiction becomes life, life finds meaning and resolves itself in fiction.
The storms and dark secrets in Lorenzo's fictional world are metaphors for his obsession, passion and conflict, the abyss that drags him deeper and deeper. He cannot share these tensions with Lucia because he thinks he is too poisoned within. He has fallen into a hole, he says, from where there is no escaping. Or not really, because he is still in touch with Luna's mother Elena through anonymous internet chat. He has been telling her a story that gives her two ""advantages"": one, that at the end of the story there's a hole that leads one back to the middle of the story, and two, one can change one's course any time. And we see Luna has partly changed her course, she is back on Lorenzo's island. But Lorenzo is still far away from her, and, in a way, far away from Lucia. Will he be able to change the course of his life, will the hole he has fallen into lead him back to the middle of the story? Such a story has to involve Lucia-- will Lucia get back Lorenzo? Will there be a resolution?Yes, there will, but Lucia is, so far, only a reader, an admirer. She is perplexed by Lorenzo's self-absorbedness, this darkness, this hole, that she doesn't understand. So she leaves him though she knows she is still in love with him, and then her world shatters when she hears he is dead. In reality, Lorenzo is in a coma, and will come back to life later, as her ""advantage"" plays out. For the moment, however, Lucia's ""loss"" will make her cycle in Lorenzo's world, and when she moves to Lorenzo's island, the island Lorenzo would never take her to, she is really inside the hole he was in (she falls into a real cave in the island, as well). She has to travel this world and meet the characters of his fiction in ""real life"", before she will see him again. But by then the fictional and real worlds will get united, by the time Lucia and Lorenzo come together at the end, the two parallel lives of Lorenzo have become one. United and resolved, like in sex. It is this journey of Lucia to union, this tale of sex and Lucia, that the film chronicles.There is another angle to the name, as well: sex and writing are both about creation. The world Lorenzo creates pulls him in like sex does (into a hole, in both cases?). Like sex, there is the potential for obsession, and like the man he writes about, he is tormented by the tensions between the two women, two world that he has created. Upto this this is all Lorenzo's. But as the movie progresses, Lucia finds herself in a house with a man and another women, sexual tensions building up between them. Her course changes. It's because she is on that island that Elena gets to meet Lorenzo, and she really reunites Lorenzo and the mother of his child, resolves their story. And isn't that child really Lucia's love, in a way? The book that conceived Luna also made Lucia fall in love with Lorenzo, the shot of their first union cuts into Luna's birth, they both dropped into a hole together, and at the end, when Elena tells Lucia that she is a gift to the earth, she looks as happy as she would if she got back her lost child. The child who Lorenzo didn't trust with the secret, but who would have kept it if he told her. Finally she reaches the heart of that secret, the secret of her birth and her lover, through a journey of her own, hence Sex and Lucia.The little details matter. The dog that killed Luna also features in a shot on a television screen at the coffeeshop where Lucia picks Lorenzo up. Elena's anonymous friend uses a lighthouse as his icon; like a lighthouse, he shows her how to change her course, they meet for the second time in front of the island's lighthouse. The music, the visuals of the island and the underwater shots are magnificent. The metaphor of the caves in the island works very well. Each death punctuates the end of one phase and the beginning of another, almost like a chapter ending. And the end isn't just an end, it's a second chance, a resurrection, an ""advantage"". We see Carlos, Belen's mom's lover and, subsequently, Elena's guest, disappearing into a hole, we find that Belen and his mom have been declared missing. Maybe they have dropped into a hole as well, waiting to pop up somewhere else, waiting to change the courses of their lives. Those are different stories, different journeys.The acting is very good. Paz Vega, in particular, is brilliant as Lucia. All through the movie, sex is portrayed without guilt and prissiness, but it is never affected or gratuitous. I feel extremely upset the way so many American reviewers seem to be more preoccupied with the sex depicted in the movie than the movie itself.Oh, I adore this film.",Sex and Lucía

This is a true work of art and shows how much talent there is in that corner of Europe.Lucia y el sexo is a movie about the love between passionate people. Once again led by determined, intelligent, strong and sexy women with the male characters reduced to passive or vulnerable. Not negatively described, just vulnerable. The sex is the driving force in the movie and is pictured very realistically. Over the top, unnecessary would some people say - how it actually is when you're in love, would I say. Wild, tempting and amazing. Medem makes picturesque movies filled with small astonishing stories and breathtaking pictures. I always end up thinking about all these small stories, delicate links, objects that make me wonder about life. A gift Medem always has been given and is happy to give on. Yes, the sex, and yes, the life. Its a story about fragile people, but furthermore passion and fate in its raw essence.

103,petrakukacka,Just Terrible,2,6 October 2012,"This movie started poorly and just got worse. The story was weak, the characters were shallow and poorly developed, the writing was not strong and the acting was mediocre. Each plot and sub-plot was washed out and uninteresting, it was convoluted, messy and there were continuity errors or maybe, in the mind of the director, they were 'devices' - in any case the story development was poorly executed. The way the story was knitted together using tricks and gimmicks where nothing is quite explained and the narration and dialogue is in riddles... very juvenile and poorly conceived, maudlin and misguided. The relationship between the leads was also not believable, probably in large part due to the fact that the Lorenzo character was a miscast. I would give it a 0 but can't because I couldn't finish it (very rare for me) and so it wouldn't be fair to give a full 0. Also, some of the cinematography was nice (albeit gimmicky at times) and Ana Vargas was very hot earning modest points, but overall an abject failure and waste of time.",Sex and Lucía

Well-acted, well-shot, well-written and well-directed, total communion of many talents. I was drawn to this movie immediately - the title and the quirky girl on the cover. Though I thought this might be one of those films where I just seem to be waiting for the next sex scene, I was quite surprised that my attention to every beautiful scene was equal with intent. After seeing the film, I feel like the title sets, especially the American audience, in the wrong direction. I almost wonder why the chosen title - was it to say: ""Is that all this story is about or is there something deeper here?"" The answer is ""Si"" - it is much deeper, deeper than what is even comprehensible to the casual viewer - or the attentive viewer for that matter. In this respect, it reminds me of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. A gorgeous, twisted journey where one need not fully understand every artistic intent in order to appreciate the beauty and insight from the experience.Superb!",Sex and Lucía
105,elmarbel,Simply Lovely,8,27 December 2004,"I found this film absolutely terrific. Ik know there's a lot of sex in it and yes, there are a lot of suspicious coincidences, but I looked past that.For starters, I loved the story, it wasn't boring at all, despite what some may say. It was a sort of twisty fairytale to me, just like 'Los Amantes del Circulo Polàr' was. I love good fairy tales!The acting was very good by most actors (I love you Najwa!), and good by the others. Even the girl that played Luna was convincing.The film has a lot of explicit scenes (sexual and non-sexual) but besides from that Médem accomplishes to put a lot of suggestion in it (sexual and non-sexual). If you watch it attentively and past merely what you see, you will notice the subtlety of the characters and story.Last of all i would like to say that the English title (Sex and Lucia) is an abomination to the original title (Lucia y el Sexo). The word are the same, but the word order has flipped, which gives the title a whole other meaning, to my opinion. The film is about Lucia and the meaning sex has in her life and the life of others. It is not about sex and the way Lucia handles with it. The meaning of film titles is often lost in translation (no pun intended). Why can't American (and other) people keep the original title? We can in Belgium.A la proxima",Sex and Lucía

This film is not for everyone - like most foreign films - and by it's title, you can assume that there's a good chance that there's quite a bit of sexual content in it, so I'm not sure why anyone would criticize it for that.Anyway, this is by far one of the better films I've seen recently, and it's not really about sex, but about the relationship Lucia has with her boyfriend and the crisis he is going through.

All of the women on this film look very similar and because of the time span this story goes through their looks change only making them look more similar. Lorenzo the male character is very disturbed and there comes a point that you begin to feel ""who cares?"" when watching his story unfold. Lucia (Paz Vega) is a catch, she plays the role of the girlfriend every guy wants perfectly. The film winds around erotically bending rules and then at the end ties the story together almost surprisingly. Be patient and enjoy this movie , it pays off at the end.",Sex and Lucía
109,waaldwyn,Is it real?,8,19 November 2006,"Movies like this that tread heavily into the surreal are fascinating to me. The moon (positive), the hole (negative or inverse of the moon), the man suddenly arising from the still mud (creation). I think that we can consider the movie as ""real"" or plausible if we consider that the characters arise from the writer's consciousness. ""I'm going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)"" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing. Why does the dog kill the little girl? Does the dog symbolize lust (note Lucia keeps saying, ""I'm dying!"" as she has sex with Lorenzo)? This is all in his head, I think, or in the computer, and finally in the manuscript displayed at the end.",Sex and Lucía
