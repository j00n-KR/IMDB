0,Leofwine_draca,Continuing blandness,4,28 October 2017,"THE SCORCH TRIALS is the second film in the MAZE RUNNER series, a series which is already outstaying its welcome thanks to the over-familiarity of the material which gives it a cookie-cutter feel. The kids from the last film have survived and escaped into a new world which turns out to be just as deadly as the last one. Expect the usual gamut of bland characterisation, an over-reliance on CGI to provide all of the landscape and action shots, and predictable twists and turns in the narrative. I enjoyed Aidan Gillen's presence here but that's about it. This is the kind of film that slips from my memory just moments after the credits roll, and the kind of film that I'll never have any interest in returning to - especially when there's so much better stuff out there.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
1,SnoopyStyle,action packed sequel,6,6 August 2016,Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the rest of the Gladers are welcomed by Janson (Aidan Gillen) who claims to be the opposition to WiCKD. There are more young people from other Mazes. Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) gets separated from the boys. Maze runner Aris reveals the disturbing situation to Thomas. Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is actually in charge and draining something from the young people. Thomas leads the guys to rescue Teresa and escape into the Scorch outside. They go in search for the rebels Right Arm. Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his group including charge Brenda take the group captive.This sequel to 'The Maze Runner' is filled with action. The start is not the best. Janson should gather the group and explain the world even if he injects some lies about himself. The exposition would help reconnect passing fans with the material. This world does not always make sense. The boys are too trusting which doesn't make sense. There are some solid action especially escaping from the zombie-like Crank. Climbing up the apocalyptic staircase is loads of fun. Wicked is not a good evil corp name. This movie makes the best of the flawed YA material.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
2,claudio_carvalho,Full of Action Sequel,7,1 November 2015,"After escaping from the Maze, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) are welcomed by Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) in a protected facility. They meet other survivors from other mazes and they learn that everyday, a group of teenagers is summoned to be lodged in farms and communities in safe areas. However Thomas decides to investigate what happens with the teenagers and he meets Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland). Soon they find that the place is a WCKD facility and Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is alive and the leader of experiments with the teenagers that are intubated neither alive nor dead. Further, his group will be the next to be guinea pigs. Thomas and Aris succeed in escaping with the other Gladers from the facility and they decide to search the resistance group The Right Arm that is hidden at the mountains. Along their journey, they find the post-apocalyptic world completely destroyed; they meet the Cranks, zombies infected by the Flare virus; they have the loss of a friend; they face storm in the desert and a dangerous group of survivors; and they are betrayed by a friend. Now Thomas and his friends want revenge against the WCKD and Thomas promises to kill Ava Paige. ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is a full of action sequel of ""Maze Runner'. The story has a predictable plot point disclosing that one character is a traitor. There is no explanation why the teenagers needed to stay in the Glade and why the WCKD wanted them submitted to the situations against the Grievers of the previous movie. Maybe the explanation will be given on the next film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Maze Runner: Prova de Fogo"" (""Maze Runner: Really Tough Test"").",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
3,nogodnomasters,Hope is a dangerous thing,8,29 March 2018,"I talk about plot, make comparisons, and may be considered to be spoilers.As being the guy who hasn't read the books, I was glad to see this one answer questions left unanswered...and I am still unsure why they were put into the maze only to take them out if their immune system enzymes are the big picture. It seems the earth was destroyed by scorch or something and a zombie virus called ""flare"" had infected the general population as the WCKD look for a cure, that for some reason can never be synthesized, reproduced, etc.We have a typical post apocalyptic society with destroyed landmarks, zombies, and pockets of people living in remote areas. I personally liked the version where Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) was played by Milla Jojovich. But hey, that's just me. It excites me more for a supermodel to save the world than a bunch of teens.Action, shooting, killing, and zombies. Is it me or is Dylan O'Brien's character and acting on the stiff side?No F-bombs, sex or nudity.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
4,kosmasp,"Through with the Maze, but still running",7,11 February 2016,"Haven't read the book(s), so pointing that out from the start, because I read some really angry reviews by people who have read it. There's people out there who hate the filmmakers/writers of this, because they soiled on the book and made it something they didn't want to see. Can't comment on that only on how the movie felt.And it felt kinda freeing (no pun intended) to some regard. Especially after leaving the one location plot from the first movie. A lot of new characters get introduced and some nice actors join in on the act. Whether you like it or not will depend on if you know where this is going. It's going actually pretty dark and I didn't expect to see those ""creatures"" to be honest. The effects are more than decent and the movie has a nice pace to it (15 minutes of outtakes was a bit excessive though, on the disc, but you can tell they had fun making the movie)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"Actually, pretty good.",7,21 May 2016,"I'll start by saying I liked the first instalment, I wasn't crazy about it, but it was watchable enough, possibly a little slow. The follow up beats it in pretty much every area, it's more exciting, more action packed, boasts better special effects, and is just somehow much more watchable and enjoyable. It has a darker, more adult feel, there are some particularly well done scenes. I did find the attempts at the touching scenes weren't wonderfully delivered, they felt a bit out of place, clunky and overdone. The film is 78% running around, if you can deal with that I think you'll enjoy it.Way better then the first, 7/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
6,jboothmillard,Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,6,19 September 2015,"The first film I watched on a whim, only going by positive reviews, it turned out to be a great entertaining film, I knew it was based on the popular young adult sci-fi adventure trilogy of novels, and I was definitely up for the second instalment. Basically the survivors of ""the Glade"" and the maze trials: Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Love Actually's Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores), are being taken to a facility, run by Mr. Janson (Game of Thrones' Aidan Gillen), he calls it a ""safe haven"", protecting them from ""WCKD"" (WICKED - World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department), the Flare virus and the Cranks (infected human zombies). Other survivors of multiple mazes are also present, all are provided clothes, food, beds and sanitation, but Thomas is suspicious what is happening behind the closed doors, as survivors are called by name and taken away, but never seen again. With the help of Aris (Jacob Lofland) they discover that WICKED leader Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) is still alive, Janson works for WICKED, they are heard discussing the experiment on the Immunes, and there is mention of a resistance group in the mountains called The Right Arm, who they are trying to find. Thomas and Aris tell the rest of the group what they saw, including people called out strung up and being drained, they escape the facility, troops are ordered by Janson to track them down, the group find themselves in the deserted outside, the Scorch, and the next morning they discover the true nature of the disaster that destroyed the world, an abandoned city turned to ruins, and they encounter Cranks. Winston has become infected by the Flare virus, the group are forced to leave him behind to shoot himself, preventing his transformation, they continue to venture towards the mountains to find the the resistance group who could help them. In the middle of the night, whilst sleeping in the desert, they discover civilisation, escaping a thunderstorm they enter a facility, Himho is struck by lightning, but survives. The room is filled with chained Cranks, the group meet Brenda (Rosa Salazar) and Jorge (Breaking Bad's Giancarlo Esposito), they lead a dangerous band of survivors, using chained Cranks like guard dogs, hearing they are from WICKED the two agree to take them to the Right Arm, only for them to be attacked moments later by WICKED, led by Janson, the facility is destroyed by Jorge's explosives. Thomas and Brenda are left behind, while the rest of the group have escaped with Jorge, Thomas and Brenda escape Cranks, but she becomes infected in the process they next find a small community within the ruins, and almost slip into madness taking spiked drinks. But Thomas and Brenda eventually reunite with the rest of the group, Jorge interrogates drugged drinks supplier and survivor Marcus (Alan Tudyk) who secretly works for WICKED into revealing the whereabouts of the Right Arm, the group continue to travel and find the Right Arm's location. Aris is recognised by members of the Right Arm, other innocent survivors are present, their leader is Vince (Barry Pepper) who will decide if they can stay or not, he threatens to shoot Brenda with her infection getting worse, he is stopped by former WICKED scientist Mary (Ransom's Lili Taylor), she reveals that Thomas was their informant. Mary halts Brenda's infection using an enzyme cure, she explains that this enzyme cannot be manufactured, it is only harvested from an Immune's body, it was arguments over methods of manufacturing the cure with Ava lead to Mary's departure from WICKED. Teresa goes against the group and calls WICKED from their location, she believes that the motivations of WICKED are good, soon they are ambushed by WICKED, with Ava and Janson arriving, they attempt to explain their intentions to try and stop the Flare virus and why their work is so important, but Thomas will not listen, knowing that what they are doing is wrong, so battle ensues. Survivors are captured for experimentation, including Minho and Brenda, Janson shoots Mary dead, WICKED troops and fended off by Thomas and the Right Arm, before the WICKED aircraft takes off. In the end it seems that the remaining survivors are defeated and outnumbered, but Thomas explains his determination to save his friends, to take down WICKED and to save civilisation, his remaining friends and the Right Arm agree to help Thomas, they prepare to fight back. Also starring Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel as Harriet and Katherine McNamara as Sonya. O'Brien is still reasonably good as the brave leader for everyone, Gillen as the leader and Clarkson as the cold-blooded scientist are good villains, and supporting stars Scodelario, Brodie-Sangster, Esposito, Pepper and others get their moments. There are still similarities to The Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies, plus an apocalyptic zombie movie added, the previous film was claustrophobic, this time conspiracy and political stuff is much more evident, there is just enough mystery remaining, but it is perhaps predictable in parts, and not as clever, but it is still very much exciting with chase and explosive sequences to create high-octane action, I can't wait for the third and final film, a worthwhile science-fiction dystopian action thriller. Good!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
7,Tweekums,A decent enough second instalment,7,21 September 2017,"After the events of 'The Maze Runner' the survivors are taken to what they are told is a waystation by a group claiming to have rescued them from the sinister 'WCKD' (Wicked) organisation. They learn that there are many others who were in different mazes and each day a few are chosen and sent on to a say location. Thomas, the protagonist of the first film, investigates the facility and makes a shocking discovery; it is run by WCKD and those who they believed had departed are being held in a comatose state for reasons that aren't immediately obvious. He also learns that there is a rebel group known as the Right Hand in the mountains. He, and the others in his dormitory break out, rescue his friend Teresa then head out into 'The Scorch'. This is the outside world; there is destruction everywhere, infected individuals who act like 'fast zombies' threaten them regularly and all the time WCKD is after them. They manage to meet up with other people but not all of them can be trusted.This is a solid enough sequel although I must admit I preferred the original film as it had a greater sense of mystery. Here there are less intriguing questions. The antagonists are nicely threatening even if calling them WCKD is a little weak; what sort of serious organisation calls itself 'Wicked'; it sounds more like a thinks-its-trendy nightclub or an alcopop wait, the latter does exist! On the plus side though there is lots of action and a real sense of danger. The 'Infected' were much scarier than anything I'd expected to see in a UK 12 certificate film. The film looked really good; the destroyed cities looked impressively real. The characters are interesting enough, as well as the survivors from the first film there are some notable additions; most obviously Janson, the chief antagonist, and Brenda and Jorge, two potential allies. Overall this is decent enough even if it is very much the middle instalment in a trilogy. Hopefully 'The Death Cure' will provide a good conclusion to the story.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
8,paul_haakonsen,Just another pointless sequel...,3,1 January 2021,"Oh dear lord. Well, the 2014 ""The Maze Runner"" movie wasn't exactly a grand gem in cinema history, but at least the predecessor was way more watchable then this 2015 sequel titled ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" turned out to be.Granted, the storyline in the first movie wasn't really interesting, nor making much of any sense, then the storyline in the 2015 sequel was making even less sense and proved to be much less entertaining and less watchable. It felt like the storyline in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" was just made up on the fly as director Wes Ball was making progress in shooting the movie.And it was strange that the sequel was so much more worse than its predecessor, especially so given the fact that they managed to acquire a handful of bigger names to appear in the movie, with the likes of Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen and Barry Pepper appearing in ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"".I lost interest in the storyline about halfway through the movie, yet I managed to endure the movie to the very end. But honestly, the last half of the movie was just watched with one eye on the screen and one eye on social media. Man, this was a trivial and pointless movie. There is a snowballs chance in Hell of me ever returning to watch ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" for a second time.This 2015 sequel was a massive swing and a miss from director Wes Ball, and my rating of it settles on a generous three out of ten stars. This is not a movie worth the time or effort.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
9,Scarecrow-88,The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,8,28 November 2015,"I couldn't disagree more with the critical disappointment in the middle film of the series as the theatrical experience I had tonight didn't disappoint. The survivors of the Maze from the previous film are herded into this facility where others like them are gathered. Something about this place is sinister and our hero, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), suspects that something is going on. The head of this facility, Janson (Aidan Gillen), has one of those untrustworthy faces and soon proves to be an asshole under the leadership of ""Wicked"" (Patricia Clarkson, stepping in as the Donald Sutherland (Hunger Games) and Kate Winslet (Divergent) villain for the Maze series), a scientific organization hoping to find a cure for an infection that is inflicting its wrath on all but the immune (a generation of kids hooked to blood-draining machines as Thomas and a ""ventilation shaft spy"" named Aris (Jacob Lofland) soon realize. Thomas initiates an escape plan, urging Minho, Newt, Frypan, Winston, and eventually Teresa (Thomas must fetch her from a bed as she was being tested on) to join him and Aris to find a way out of the facility or else be hooked up to blood- draining machines themselves. What awaits them, a city of wreckage and sand (not to mention atmospheric weather and winds that stir up on occasion), and a frightening scattering of infected ""cranks"" (infected ghouls that once were human until total deterioration and disease corrupted their bodies). The Wicked have a highly sophisticated military force behind them, though, and besides all the obstacles our already up against, getting away from Clarkson's Ava and Janson'a military will be just as hazardous.The cranks are a damned scary bunch, and their hideous features (their vine-like infectious ""full term"" developed monsters in an underground tunnel system are particularly grotesque) certainly could cause nightmares. The introduction of Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar, part of a warehouse of survivors looking to profit off of anyone Wicked might be interested in) should be key characters (they make their presence felt in the sequel, lending a hand to our heroes in key moments; Salazar's harrowing near-fatal fall from the twisted and broken skyscraper as a crank almost kills her is a showstopper; Esposito's use of a vehicle to disrupt Wicked's total collection of the rebels is a celebratory moment) going forward. The revelation of infected in a darkened mall buried under sand is intense and well orchestrated as is the escape from Janson's facility, with Thomas giving him the finger a nicely satisfying plus. The pace, action set-pieces, special effects of the cranks and the city ruins, and clear explanation of what is at stake (tragedy strikes the rebels when one key ally of Thomas turns against him, causing much death in the process) builds to quite a dramatic conclusion setting up the next film. As is often the case in the sequel, the dramatic shift against the heroes has us wondering how in the world the villains won't achieve success against them.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
10,CinemaSerf,I think this maze has a mind of it's own....,6,20 April 2020,"Well, if you are looking for a collection of good looking folks lurching from one perilous scenario to another - desperate to escape the clutches of the arch villain that is Aiden Gillen; then this is the film for you. If you are looking for anything remotely akin to the books that tell of the continuing adventures of Thomas, Newt etc. as they attempt to defy the will of WIKD, then get ye hence (as Shakespeare might have said) for this film has nothing for you. Gillen has all the terror-factor of Mary Poppins and whilst Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario and Thomas Brodie-Sangster; along with a seriously hammy Giancarlo Esposito look like they are having some fun with their escapade-driven flight; the dialogue is all over the place and the story lacks any sort of structure. The effects work well and the battle scenes are well put together but, ultimately, it is a sort of ""Percy Jackson"" version of the story; watchable but forgettable and not in the same class as the first film.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
11,utgard14,The chase is afoot,6,13 March 2016,"I'm not familiar with the Maze Runner books but I enjoyed the first movie. It had a nice mystery and felt like a refreshing change from most of these YA dystopian future movies, which all kind of bleed together after awhile with their chosen one (usually a girl) and their tacked-on romance (usually a love triangle with the chosen one torn between a boring guy and a heartthrob). This second movie is a bit of a step down from the first one but still better than average for the genre. The biggest fault with this one is that it lacks the intriguing hook of the first film, instead relying on a series of chase scenes and action set pieces to keep viewers interested. The characters are chased by men with guns, zombies, lightning storms, more zombies, more men with guns, yet more zombies, etc. If the characters stop for more than a few minutes, you can rest assured they will soon be chased by something.What the movie is lacking in story, however, it at least partially makes up for with its strong cast. The returning actors from the first movie are still enjoyable to watch here, particularly Dylan O'Brien. It doesn't take a psychic to see he's got a big future ahead of him. Reliable pros Giancarlo Esposito and Aidan Gillen join the cast in this one; both are great. Rosa Salazar is also a nice addition to the cast. It's obviously a movie that's best viewed as part of a series. It doesn't have a beginning or an end, which is irritating but expected as the middle parts of these YA movie series tend to be like that. But at least this one is entertaining. The chase scenes, while repetitive, are exciting and the characters are interesting. Can't wait for the last in the series. I hope it's as good as the first one but I am keeping my expectations low.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
12,oscaralbert,Those who see no difference between science fiction films . . .,6,5 October 2015,". . . and fantasy flicks may well think that life is too short to see BOTH the HUNGER GAMES and the MAZE RUNNER movies (or BOTH the STAR WARS saga & the STAR TREK franchise, or both SUPERMAN & SPIDERMAN, but that's another couple of discussions). So if you're trying to resolve your personal HUNGER GAMES vs. MAZE RUNNER dilemma, here are a few key points to remember. HUNGER GAMES stars top quality actors such as Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence (as the main character) and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. MAZE RUNNER just has Lili Taylor and Patricia Clarkson. The plot of HUNGER GAMES involves threatened teens, and ranges planet-wide in a convincing alternate world. The plot of MAZE RUNNER involves threatened teens, and moves from one implausible claustrophobic fake set to another. (The second MR outing throws in zombie attacks absolutely at random, whenever its producers realize how boring it's getting.) MAZE RUNNER steals liberally from HUNGER GAMES and PETER PAN. The setting for MAZE RUNNER consists primarily of matte paintings. Seeing people move amid these ludicrous backgrounds can be a bit jarring (such as the scene on the horizontal high-rise window between Thomas, Brenda, and a zombie). Just reading a graphic novel will be a more satisfying experience than MAZE RUNNER--the book's ideas, characters, and settings are likely to be much better integrated.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
13,view_and_review,Dystopian Fatigue,3,17 October 2016,"Here's the truth. I'm tired of these dystopian movies-especially the teenage dystopian movie. Please, I beg of you, give me something new and refreshing. Yes, Hunger Games was a smashing success but even that began to wane as J Law lost her innocent look and her voice morphed into a raspy ever-present cry of ""Pita!"". It also didn't help that I had already forgotten most of what happened in the first Maze Runner. I'm watching Scorch Trials saying: ""Who are these guys again?"" ""Where are they?"" ""Who are they running from?"" ""Why is everything in ruins?"" ""OK, I no longer care."" It is a feature length film of a bunch of guys and one girl running from one place to another while performing selfless acts of heroism to save one another without the least bit of believability. The protagonist should be nominated as a saint he cares so much about his comrades. And no, I'm not ridiculing his desire to save his friends, I certainly would too--but this guy took being a savior as a personal life goal. There was no life to insignificant to save.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
14,neil-476,A Middle Film (and you know what that means),7,18 September 2015,"1024 Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials Thomas and the surviving escapers from the Maze find themselves hosted (or imprisoned), together with survivors from other mazes, under the auspices of WIKD management chap Janson. They decide to escape, finding themselves in a desolate world – part desert, part ruined cities – where they encounter both survivors (not necessarily charitable disposed towards them) and people infected with the Flare virus. One of their number may have secrets to hide, and Thomas' forgotten past may also have some unwelcome memories.First of all, don't even think of going to see this film unless you've seen The Maze Runner – you'll be completely lost. I read the books (which are a decent read, though not without flaws), so I had an idea of what direction the film was following, because it suffers badly from Middle Film Syndrome - it means nothing without having the foundation of the first film (which wasn't bad), and suffers from not having an ending.I love post-apocalypse stories, and the visuals here are very well done – the ruined cityscapes are completely convincing. The action is a different kettle of fish, however. Firstly, there is a distinct video game feel here – the protagonists lurch from obstacle to obstacle (the previous film had a strong element of mystery to it, but any mystery here is lost in the linear progression between set-pieces). Worse, much of the action takes place in darkness and is filmed in that annoying, extreme close-up, hand-held, rapidly edited way which means that you can't follow what's happening or who it's happening to – the middle section is essentially a fast zombie chase movie all on its own.Performances are variable. New cast member Rosa Salazar does well as Brenda, and I liked both Barry Pepper and Aiden Gillen (not at all how I'd envisaged Janson), but Dylan O'Brien as Thomas delivers so much of his dialogue in a croaking mumble that I could hardly comprehend most of what he said, which was something of a disadvantage given that what he was saying was pretty central. I think.The 3D is worthless. Don't bother with it.Overall, I think this one will be best appreciated when you sit down to watch the 4 films on 4 successive evenings.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
15,deloudelouvain,Same entertainment as the first one and that's not bad to me,7,2 January 2016,"So many haters on IMDb and I wonder why. I honestly did enjoy Maze Runner The Scorch Trials. Like I did enjoy the first one as well. I wanted action and science fiction and that's what I got. You can't say there is no action in this movie because that's all there is. Action from the first second till the last second. The sci-fi is also good enough for me to entertain me during more then two hours. I saw way worse sci-fi movies then this one. Better ones as well but that's not the point. This movie keeps you entertained and that's what's it all about to me. The actors are not bugging me, not a single one of them, and that's rare to me. I am already looking forward to the next Maze Runner and I am not a big fan of long series of movies, so that resumes it all. To the haters, go watch some stupid movies from Lynch or Von Trier, where you waste your time with a movie without a story, and then brag about how great it was shot.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
16,siderite,"Decent, but still too young adult",7,2 June 2016,"Compared to the plethora of YA films lately, The Maze saga is not that bad and The Scorch Trials is one of the best so far. Yet I can't stop feeling cheated every time an artificial bit of drama is added, when every adolescent in the world (and in time) is supposed to act like a millennial and when every movie ends up in a cliffhanger to support the money making machine that produced both book and film series.The acting is good, the direction is good, the effects are decent, the soundtrack is unsubtle propaganda, the script is reasonable. What the series lacks desperately is real characters. The villains are caricaturesque in most YA movies - I mean, they're adults, what do they know? - but so are the teenage heroes and every single character in The Scorch Trials acts like 21th century Americans scared of nothing except going over the PG-13 rating. I found it impossible to empathize with any of the heroes, the emotional scenes felt like hammer blows on nails - fingernails, that is - without any sense of measure, subtlety or attempt to reach the viewer.The lack of character development becomes crystal clear as the heroes go through the same thing again and again and again and again and fail to learn anything from it. They don't grow, instead remaining the same puppet like characters, capable of only moral outrage or rebellious spirit.Bottom line: better than Hunger Games and Divergent and The 5th Wave, even if they are all essentially the same story, but the feeling of ""this was made for money and nothing more"" never leaves you.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
17,Hellmant,Hopefully the conclusion is a lot better!,6,21 October 2015,"'MAZE RUNNER: THE SCORCH TRIALS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Post-apocalyptic sci-fi sequel, to the 2014 hit; both films are based on the book series, by James Dashner. The story picks up, where the last one left off, with the Gladers now on the run; in a deserted outside world, filled with zombies. The young survivors are desperately trying to find clues, about the corrupt organization known as the WCKD. The film was once again directed by Wes Ball and written by T.S. Nowlin (the two made their feature film directing and writing debuts, with the original movie). It stars Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario and Patricia Clarkson; all reprising their roles from the first film. They're joined this time around, by newcomers Jacob Lofland, Aidan Gillen, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosa Salazar, Barry Pepper, Lili Taylor and Alan Tudyk. I was somewhat impressed with the original movie, but I found this sequel to be pretty uneventful and boring.The film begins with the survivors of the maze, in the first movie, being taken to a facility; for their protection from the outside world. Thomas (O'Brien) becomes very suspicious, of what's going on at the site, and starts snooping around. He learns that the leader of the establishment, Mr. Janson (Gillen), is actually working for the WCKD. Thomas, and his friends, decide to escape (as a result); and learn more about the motives of this ruthless organization. They have to survive in 'the Scorch' (the outside world), while being hunted by the WCKD, in order to do so.The film is very long and drawn-out; but most of all it's just plain boring. There's some decent effects, and action scenes, including several zombie attacks; but they're mostly uninvolving, and kind of thrill-less. There's almost no plot, or character development, in the entire movie! I could have cared less, what was going on, at almost any point in the film. I didn't feel this way about the first movie, at all. I've also heard, that this film is almost nothing like the book (which I haven't read). It's mostly just a waste; and a pretty big step backwards, for the series. Hopefully the conclusion is a lot better!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/wb45jfQumZ0",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
18,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 June 2019,"Pretty enjoyable movie. much better than the first. wasn't a fan of some of the characters (dad and daughter). the first half was actually really intense, fun and suspenseful. even scary/startling at times. second half wasn't as good (1 viewing)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
19,Robert_duder,An awful lot of harsh criticism for a teen-adventure flick,7,30 October 2015,"Maze Runner is NOT Hunger Games. It could be described as a poor man's version of The Hunger Games. Originally when the first one released, I didn't really care to see it but when I finally watched the first one I was very pleased. It was actually a lot of fun. It's simple and has a slight moral message but the action and intrigue and characters were all very good. So now I was a fan enough to look forward to the second one. I will say that I think they definitely rushed Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. They were too caught up in the release one instalment every year idea. The Scorch Trials feels completely different in a lot of ways from the first film. I have not read the books so I can't speak to the similarities but it sounds like readers hate the movie. From an entertainment standpoint, The Scorch Trials is decent. Its still well acted though I think they could have developed the characters a little more because now it feels like this is all about special effects and monsters and the extended post-apocalyptic world. There are some great twists and turns and some interesting plot points so it is far from a total loss.Dylan O'Brien returns as Thomas and he is still a good hero. He definitely shows an intensity even if its just a little overacted. Still for the demographic of pre-teen/teen girls I'm sure he fits the bill perfectly. The supporting cast (many of them returning from the first film) are all good but underdeveloped and underused. Ki Hong Lee, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden and Alexander Flores return and they are good but there really is a lot they could do with these characters to make them stand out on their own. Kaya Scodelario returns as Theresa and this time she isn't the sole female presence. She gets a little more arc than some of the characters and gets one of the better scenes towards the end as well. Patricia Clarkson is the villain/overlord and she is decent but I keep waiting for her to really impress. As far as villain goes, Aiden Gillen was a much better villain for the story but that means Clarkson should be even more evil but she doesn't come across that way. Additions to the cast include Lili Taylor, Barry Pepper and Kathryn Smith-Mcglynn in adult roles that were interesting but once again underdeveloped. Maybe they're leaving some for the future films but it doesn't really feel that.How it feels is rushed...Maybe they weren't expecting the first one to make money or maybe they didn't have a lot of hope in it but I feel like they really dropped the ball. It had some great action scenes and some good special effects but it felt disjointed and like they weren't sure what to do. I'm glad they kept the same director with Wes Ball but he didn't have virtually any experience going in. Still, the first Maze Runner was quite good and showed a lot of potential. Wes Ball had so much experience in art direction and the first film really showed some amazing cinematography and use of special effects and this one being out in ""the scorch"" could have really been impressive but it lacked. I hate to keep emphasizing that but when you're trying to build a franchise and fall onto the footsteps of The Hunger Games (or even Divergent) you need to really impress and you need to get better, not drop the ball. Still if you enjoyed the first one, you will enjoy this as well and I hope that they turn this around and come back strong in the third instalment. 7/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
20,ThomasDrufke,Welcome to the Scorch,6,25 September 2015,"The first Maze Runner had some promise. I think there are probably too many young adult dystopian or Utopian films these days, but The Maze Runner was a pretty cool refresher on how to handle the genre. The Scorch Trials was a different film all together. There is once again a lot of entertainment to be had here. You get appearances from several famous actors including Barry Pepper, Giancarlo Esposito, Aidan Gillen, and even some zombie scenes along the way. But unfortunately the film is so uneven and confusing that I can't really recommend the film to anyone.Thomas, played by Dylan O'Brien, leads the team out of the maze and into the hands of surprise surprise Wicked, once again. This begins the 2 hours and 12 minutes of cinema where its not really all that clear who's intentions are what and who's on whose side. The nice part is that the chemistry within the group is excellent. Unlike some other young adult franchises, you care about these characters, which is what makes the zombie scenes that much more terrifying. Speaking of which, I found the CG to be incredibly effective. The zombies were somewhat inconsistent, which may have been the point. But I thought one building action sequence in particular looked fantastic for a 60 million dollar budget film.The problem is that the film doesn't flow at all from one scene to another. Characters just show up randomly several times. It just seemed like the writers didn't know where to take the story. It's also very uneven. I didn't know whether it was actually trying to be a zombie movie or not. Plus, the lead villains are in the film for about 15- 20 minutes total. There really is no beginning, middle, and end. But there are segments that are full of entertainment, which is why I ended up having a good time at the movies. I just think for being 45 minutes longer than the first film, it had room to improve the franchise much more than it ended up doing.+O'Brien has some chops+CG+Entertaining sequences+Surprise actor appearances-Uneven story-No flow at all-So bloody confusing6.0/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
21,cricketbat,Released at the wrong time,6,23 November 2018,It's a shame that Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials came out long after the post-apocalyptic young adult fiction craze had worn out its welcome. The story and the characters all seem worn out and clichéd. It's also a shame that this movie can't really stand on its own. It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story - which is why I'm tired of trilogies. This is not a bad movie. It's actually pretty entertaining. It was just released at the wrong time.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

23,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,14 December 2015,"Maze Runner: The Scorch TrialsThe worst thing about a dystopian future is that all online dating profiles will be that of cannibals.What's more, the scary singles in sci-fi movie are also contagious.After escaping from the maze, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the others from the Glades (Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario, Ki Hong Lee) find themselves in a government facility protecting them from the virus and the infected outside.Thomas doubts their host's intentions and soon formulates an escape plan that will lead them to the Right Arm (Lili Taylor, Barry Pepper), resistance fighters in the mountains.Despite a few twists, this second chapter of the Maze Runner doesn't match its predecessor's intrigue.Reduced to derivative anti-government drivel like its contemporaries, Scorch Trials' cliffhanger ending is hopefully not a continuance of this played out parable.Mind you, it's comforting to know that in a post-apocalyptic world survivors can look forward to a government pension.

24,851222,Entertaining,8,21 November 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" (2015) is a bit weaker then it's predecessor but still entertaining and enjoyable flick. If you liked the first one (like i though it was highly enjoyable), that doesn't mean you will like this as well because plot is totally different in this one (and i read that it is totally different from the book) - it is a sequel which expands this universe, and i liked the overall ""world"" which is created here, it is a much darker dystopia future then lets say ""Divirgent"" series has got. Nevertheless i enjoyed ""The Scorch Trials"" for what it is - a very solidly executed entertaining flick which is best seen with some friends in evening. Overall, ""The Scorch Trials"" isn't original by a mile, you can see type cast actors from a mile, and if you know their acting backgrounds, their characters in this movie won't surprise you. This is a well paced, executed and crafted intense action / adventure / thriller / dystopia future flick.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
25,The-Sarkologist,Not as original as I expected,5,14 September 2015,"You know how there are these movies where they make the initial movie that is really good and then when the sequel comes out it turns out to be nothing all that new? Well, this is one of those films. Okay, to give it credit it is based on a series of books, and from watching this film I can tell that the problem lies more with the books than it does with the film. While I did enjoy the film I was a little disappointed that what happened to be a really good initial offering has turned out to be little more than another zombie movie.That's right – as it turns out the Maze Runner trilogy is just another zombie movie, and it isn't as if it is original either – in fact there were so many things that were borrowed from much better movies, such as 28 Days Later, Aliens, and The Empire Strikes Back, that in the end my head literally began to swim. As I said though, I didn't mind the film – it was quite entertaining, however as I have also said, this is basically another zombie movie.The film begins with our heroes having escaped the maze and being brought into a secure facility. Initially we have them running from the helicopter into the facility while a bunch of creatures charge at them from the sand dunes. It is not clear at this stage what these creatures are – I just thought they were simply bandits attacking from the desert. Once they escape and end up confronting them we discover that they are riddled with disease and mindlessly attack anybody who comes across their path – oh, and they are contagious as well. As I said – zombies.We also quickly discover that their rescue from the maze at the end of the first film is little more than an elaborate ploy to lower their guard – WCKD wasn't destroyed, they were just making them think that they had succeeded. Okay, like 28 Days Later, the zombie part of the film sits in the background and much of the story involves them attempting to stay one step ahead of this organisation while they are being relentlessly pursued – not just by WCKD, but also by the occasional zombie (who by the way never seem to tire). Another thing I noticed was that the film makers seemed to have a thing for ruined cities. In fact even though it appeared that they hadn't entered a ruined city, when the scene changes they are suddenly in one. A part of me felt that this was a little over done, especially when you look at one scene and say 'but I thought they were in the middle of a desert'.As I said, I didn't mind this film, but if you don't particularly like zombie films then maybe this isn't really the film for you. As for me, unlike the Divergent trilogy, I'm probably going to see the next in the series.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
26,Reno-Rangan,The adventure expands outside the maze to seek the answers.,7,24 January 2016,"Another teen movie in the mid series on the line of 'Divergent' and 'Hunger Games'. As an adult, I don't know what to expect from it, but entertainment was the priority. The first film was just an introduction that happened in a small and a single location like the film 'Cube'. Now it has outspread in a large extent with more new characters and takes a wider adventure in the wastelands.Many doubts from the previous film were cleared, yet a few need to be clarified and hoping for the next one to do that job. But anyway the suspense was this franchise's specialty, that simply reminds us the TV series 'Lost'. This second part can be compared with plenty of other post apocalyptic films, but still I liked it better than the first.The best thing was they retained the same director and he's going to be here for the next film as well. But I'm more interested in the prequel, I mean the fourth film than the third which brings an end to the story moving forward. Because the maze holds the key for many unresolved issues. So I'm anticipating the prequel trilogy than the current one to learn how it all began.Surprisingly, many new additions like zombies, bounty hunters in the mainstream boosted the film with its variety. Gives us a creepy atmosphere, along thrilling running and chasing. The twist was not that great, but kind of unpredictable, and again due to the mysteries surrounding it, it created more curious about what might happen next.6½/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
27,Thanos_Alfie,Transitional stage...,6,8 February 2016,"""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is the sequel of ""The Maze Runner"" and it continues from the point that the Gladers escaped from the maze. After their escape they face another obstacles and difficulties in a very hostile environment.I have to admit that my expectations about this movie was higher than the first one and that was my mistake. Apparently this movie is as I wrote in my title just a transitional stage that guides us to the third movie. This movie consists with a lot of new information that makes it a little bit boring. This has as a result the action scenes of it to seem not as good as it is. The direction of this movie was made by Wes Ball as in the first one. Dylan O'Brien did his best for this movie one more time but this time his interpretation was not enough. Lastly I believe that ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is not a bad movie but eventually when it is compared with the first one then its quality is lower. The best thing that you have to do is to be prepared and do not have high expectations from this movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
28,eddie_baggins,A fun and baggage free adventure,6,5 May 2016,"Forgoing the overrated and overstated hype of the now thankfully finished Hunger Games franchise and the terrible blandness of the Divergent/Insurgent series and what your left with for futuristic Gen Y kicks is the highly enjoyable and baggage free Maze Runner series, a series that seems to know and understand what it is and has fun doing it along the way.Returning to the director's chair once more, Wes Ball and his cast of willing young stars continue on with their good work they started within the original film and while The Scorch Trials misses out a little on the underlying mystery and unique premise that propped up the original adventure there's still a sense of adventure and thrills that starts off the new film and continues on throughout.So often films cut from the same cloth of The Scorch Trials try and bring gravitas and unnecessary emotional baggage to the stories that needed to instead streamline their focus onto their strengths not ad to an already loaded premise and that's where the Scorch Trials really succeeds.We know just enough to care and hero's' and villains don't need to much exposition to make us understand why they tick and Ball has a blast exploring the now 'crank' infested wasteland that was once America and as he did with the first Maze Runner adventure action comes on thick and fast yet is handled with a certain flair that makes it that much more engaging.While the film's final stanza falls a little flat, scenes including a frenetic chase through an abandoned shopping mall, an explosive music led factory fight and a tunnel escape that leads into a fallen skyscraper are all a league above usual such event films and Ball should be credited with keeping the film ticking along at a pace that feels justified in its 2 hour run time.The Scorch Trials is under no illusions as to what it is and while dialogue and characters are all stock standard this is a highly enjoyable and perfectly paced dystopian adventure film that has successful marked the Maze Runner series as the best of the bunch of recent Gen Y book adaptations and a highly effective actioner in its own right.3 post-apocalyptic Gustavo Fring's out of 5",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
29,pennyelenabooks,not good enough,3,26 December 2015,"In the second Maze Runner movie, Thomas and his friends finds out that they haven't been rescued like we saw in the end of the first movie, but WCKD still has them. So they run away to find the resistance and join them. However the road to freedom is spread with zombies. One thing you have to keep in mind is the ending of the first film and that the Scorch Trials has nothing to do with the first movie other than that. It's more of a post apocalypse zombie movie. WCKD are the bad guys, but someone can't help but ask, what if they aren't? Sure their methods are extreme, but they are trying to find the cure, don't they. Is Thomas in the end way too selfish to not want to help find the cure, when he can easily die at the outside world anyway? The end does help put those thoughts at ease and I'm glad that they did. Other than that, the movie was enjoyable, thought it's characters were a little too naive (they walked right into many zombie nests when they could have easily walked away from there in the first place!!) So 3 out of 10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
30,filipemanuelneto,"Pretty good, but I hated the zombies.",7,29 January 2021,"After the success of the first film, the sequel was expected. And I was pleased to see it, as the first film leaves everything open and raises our curiosity for what comes next.In this film, Thomas, Teresa and the boys from the labyrinth goes to a place where there are other young people, from other labyrinths that apparently existed elsewhere. However, it is evident right from the start that the place belongs to the terrible medical organization that had kept them trapped in the maze. After they manage to escape, they discover themselves in a ruined, arid and devastated world, where the only human beings who are there are sick and maddened zombie creatures.The film is a good sequel and rises to the level of the previous film. The only thing that disappointed me was really seeing that the sick humans were similar to the living dead of a thousand and one films and series like ""Walking Dead"", for example. I expected something different. In any case, it was not unpleasant and allows for good action scenes and runs amid the ruins. The plot twist near the end is intense, unexpected and in fact allows for a very well done finish. The pace of the film is pleasant too.The film has a very good cast, and maintains the hard core of the previous film, as it had to be. Dylan O'Brian remains a good protagonist and does a very safe job. Scodelario received better material and her character was much more developed in this film, which allowed the actress to do a more interesting job. The love interest of O'Brian and Scodelario's characters is developed and credible. Ki Hong Lee and Thomas Brodie-Sangster also do a very good job on this film. Giancarlo Esposito is a welcome addition. Rosa Salazar is more effective as an action figure than in the inglorious task of making a love triangle with Scodelario and O'Brian, where she fails miserably. Patricia Clarkson is a weak and uninteresting villain, although she tries to look bad. Aidan Gillen was more effective in this task.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI that makes the whole world look like a deserted, inhospitable, poisoned and ruined place. Infected human creatures, as I said, are the least positive thing in the film, as we have seen better zombies in other films, where it is clear and assumed to be zombies. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. However, it is darker than the first film. The soundtrack also deserves mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
31,leonblackwood,Not that amazing! 5/10,5,18 April 2016,"Review: The beginning and the ending of this film, actually wasn't that bad but I got a bit fed up with all of the running around in the middle of the film, and the constant introduction of new characters. There also wasn't much depth to the various individuals, so I wasn't that bothered if they got killed off in the next scene, like a lot of them did. The actual hero in the movie, was Aris (Jacob Lofland), who done all of the hard work by getting all of the information to escape the original compound but his efforts are put aside through the rest of the film, and all of the concentration is on Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), who in my opinion, was a poor ring leader. He seemed to lead everyone into trouble most of the time, without any planning or any thought about the danger that he is putting the others in. Also, the dramatic thunder storm made me laugh because of how over the top it was, and the ridiculous zombies also made me chuckle. Out of the whole cast, none of them really stood out for me but I did like Aidan Gillen (Janson), as the villain and Barry Pepper (Vince) as the brave ""one man army"" type of character, so I'm looking forward to seeing them in Maze Runner: The Death Cure, which is due out in 2017. The whole tempo and feel of the film reminded a lot of Hunger Games, were you are looking forward to the final showdown between Thomas and Ava, just like Katniss and Snow, so I hope it doesn't disappoint like that film did. I did feel the intensity in this movie and the ending was a good build up for the final showdown in the next movie but they could have easily cut out all of the running around in the middle of the movie. My main problem with the film is the lead character, Thomas because he really doesn't have any screen charisma or the leading skills to convince everyone that they are going into battle for the good of the group. With that aside, it's still a big budget, epic movie which is definitely worth a watch but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Watchable!Round-Up: As I haven't read the Maze Runner books, I don't know how close this franchise is to the original concept, so I can't really comment on the adapted screenplay. I couldn't really see what this film had to do with a Maze but there certainly is a lot of running! Anyway, this is the first major role for the young Dylan O'Brien, 24, who also starred in The Internship and the TV series, Teen Wolf. He's due to star in Deepwater Horizon alongside Mark Wahlberg later on this year, so it will be good to see how he handles a different genre. This movie was directed by Wes Ball, who also directed the original Maze Runner and is due to direct the third instalment. I just hope that there is an epic showdown because this mediocre sequel could do with a boost.Budget: $61million Worldwide Gross: $312.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/thrillers starring Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Giancarlo Esposito, Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, Patricia Clarkson, Aidan Gillen, Barry Pepper, Nathalie Emmanuel and Rosa Salazar. 5/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

34,Vartiainen,Fails to provide satisfying answers to its most basic questions,5,5 September 2021,"The original Maze Runner film is one of the better young adult dystopia adaptations (admittedly a niche genre) I've seen. It had a good, solid identity, decent acting, very interesting location and overall it was something that managed to stand apart from its competition.Unfortunately the same can't be said about its sequel. The Scorch Trials pick up immediately after the events of the previous films. The kids are now out of the maze and are facing new and unexpected tribulations.The only problem? You know that maze in the first film? That humongous, elaborate and downright bizarre contraption of a trap that the kids had to escape from by the skin of their teeth? We get absolutely zero explanation for it. This group behind the whole thing doesn't even seem to be advanced or well-funded enough to have built it.So yeah, where the first film was an intriguing mystery of a situation, something unique and never before seen, this simply languishes in old and tired dystopia/post-apocalypse clichés. We get a desolated desert landscape. We get desperate survivors clinging to life while a group of super elites are living in dimly-lit labs and luxurious penthouses, away from the dangers. We even get zombies.Admittedly the action set pieces are still very nice and the original group of actors are about as likable as they were in the original film. Aidan Gillen is also still an absolutely perfect cast for a smarmy antagonist.But aside from those few nuggets of promise, this film was a big letdown when compared to the original.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

A non stop action adventure!!,7,26 September 2015,"I loved the first movie, so I was down to see the second.Though the first movie was smarter, this movie reads like the stereotypical sequel:It was action packed. Completely worthy of the roller coaster thrill ride reference all the professional film critics used to describe a movie. It was darker. Far darker than I would expect from what I thought was a franchise based on a novel for young adults, but considering the lead character is Thomas, The last boy to enter the maze in the first movie and help them escape it only to lead his friends into something far worse, the movie has to relate to the boy crowd that might see this over the similar Hunger Games and Divergent series.And it's way bigger than the first. Being in the maze caused for more story and creativity, but being outside the maze created an action thriller that never stops until those credits roll.And considering it's over two hours, the Scorch Trials does not feel long at all. it was the perfect movie to sit through.

I did not like it too much, but sequels can be better sometimes...Not this time, anyway. The first half-an-hour provided some questionableness and odd flaws already (e.g. did all people have different first names that they could be called up by them only; why/how the room with sophisticated technology and stuff to be concealed had no cameras?), and fast movements in the dark with occasional flashes made the distinction who-is-who? rather difficult. Again, the leading performance (Dylan O'Brien as Thomas) was less interesting than most of others, and the the choice of actors covering all genders and races to enhance audience is considered always a cheap trick by me (I have always thought that a good movie is supra-gender, -age and -race and deals with common topics). Due to the next movie already planned, the ending was trivial, and the events directly earlier were more characteristic to Seagal or Lundgren movies...In spite of the fact that I realize not being an average member of the target audience, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is just another mediocre example of movies about/for teens made during the last decade.

The first Maze Runner was in 2014 and the next one, The Death Cure, will be in 2017. This one takes up right after the first one ended where Dylan, Kaya and friends were being rescued from the evil WCKD corporation-FYI: it's pronounced 'wicked' in case you could not tell that they were the bad guys-by masked troops and flown off in a helicopter to an unknown destination. Well, they arrive. They are ushered in, fed, clothed and told that all is well. But, they are most definitely not. Dylan discovers that they are being used for research in finding a cure for the virus that has wiped out most of the human race. This virus turns it's victims into virtual zombies, which leads to lots of exciting chases as our young heroes escape into the scorch, a desert landscape surrounding them that has violent wind storms, sun, heat and even lightening storms. Oh yeah, they also have to contend with the infected zombies out there, too . Giancarlo and Rosa are two new members of the cast that show up and have their own interests in Dylan and his super friends and Patricia returns as the head doctor/mad scientist from WCKD that is chasing the kids.

39,estebangonzalez10,A slight improvement over the first installment,5,19 September 2015,"""You think I have a bloody clue? Bunch of crazies want to eat us for breakfast, by the looks of it.""Director Wes Ball is back for this second installment of novelist James Dashner's The Maze Runner trilogy. This author's books have been a success with young adults, and the first adaptation by Ball was received well by most critics. I had a very different experience from them however since I found the first film a much weaker entry to the already overexposed genre of YA novel adaptations. From the moment we were introduced to Dylan O'Brien's Thomas I couldn't ignore the fact that he was simply a male version of Katniss from The Hunger Games or Tris from the Divergent series. An outsider who has trouble fitting in to an established group but eventually becomes a leader thanks to his unique personality traits. We get it, being different isn't necessarily a bad thing. We've all went through an identity crisis as teens and I guess that is why the premise is so appealing. The refreshing difference that this YA adaptation has with the others is that it avoids the romantic elements that seem to emerge from all these films. This is a more action packed film, but at the same time it suffers from a lack of character development. The story has several flaws and it's hard to follow at times considering I honestly couldn't remember much of what had happened in the first film. All I could remember was that a group of kids managed to escape from the maze only to discover that the world around them had changed. And this second film picks up from there as we follow the young survivors through this dystopian world being chased by an organization who believes that they are the key to saving humanity. The kids themselves don't understand what is going on and they have to discover it along the way without knowing who they can trust. And that cluelessness is transferred to the audience while we get some answers along the way. The problem is I'm afraid that by the time the third film comes out we will have forgotten much of what was going on and enter the movie scratching our heads like I did this one. All we will remember are some of the action sequences that took place, but I still have no clue why these characters were even put in the maze in the first place (not sure if they already answered it in the first film or it remains an enigma to be solved in the third). It may be necessary to revisit the franchise by the time the final film is released because the plot was a bit convoluted and many questions remained unanswered. I don't want to be too critical of this film because I did think it was an improvement over the first one. I found it a better sequel than Insurgent was despite sharing some of the same flaws. The film does seem to distance itself from what it did in the first film becoming more of an action adventure film than a YA adaptation (although one could argue that it seems to be heading towards a very similar direction as the latest Hunger Games sequel). The action scenes do feel very familiar to other films and there is especially one moment where Jurassic Park: The Lost World will come to everyone's mind. It also feels very much like an episode from The Walking Dead with the introduction of some zombie like beings known as cranks. There is a decent twist during the climactic scene, but by the time we get to it we've been overexposed to the convoluted action scenes (and not in a good Mad Max Fury Road kind of way). The pacing of this film is very much an issue and if they'd edited out at least some 20 minutes of the film it could've been much more engaging.The cast is pretty solid and Dylan O'Brien turns in a charismatic lead performance, but the issue here is that these characters aren't developed at all and the action scenes seem to take center stage. There is no time to dwell on the characters because we are headed into new action sets every five minutes while new questions emerge. Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, and Alexander Flores are all back as the surviving members of the maze. Neither of them have much to do in this film, especially Scodelario who doesn't seem to have any personality whatsoever. There are several new characters as well. Jacob Lofland joins the runaway kids as Aris, another survivor from a different maze. The kids finds shelter for a short chunk of the film with a group of survivalists led by Jorge (Giancaro Esposito who you will easily recognize for his role as Gus in Breaking Bad) and Brenda (Rosa Salazar). Patricia Clarkson is back once again as the leader of the WCKD organization that is after the kids, and in this sequel we are introduced to her right hand man, Janson (Aidan Gillen from Game of Thrones). The new additions elevated the film as I found these new characters much more appealing than the previous returnees. Esposito being my favorite addition, and he should be involved in more movies because he's such a talented actor. Despite the new additions I did find the action scenes a bit tiresome. There is one scene where Thomas states he's tired of running, and it perfectly summed up how I was feeling. The open endings are also a problem with this franchise as you don't get any closure and are forced to wait for the next film to find answers. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

41,jimbo-53-186511,The real trial is sitting through this 2 hour borefest (minor spoilers),2,3 September 2016,"Let's face it the first film was not particularly original; to me it was a cross between Cube and The Truman Show, but the narrative had an element of intrigue about it and more importantly it was fun to watch and was also relatively fast-paced but sadly the same cannot be said for this rather pathetic sequel....Yes it opens up well and yes it is intriguing.....for about the first 15 minutes, but once they (SPOILER) escape the facility then the picture really slows down and becomes really lazy (fast-moving Zombies are very much the order of the day a la Dawn Of The Dead and World War Z as well as using the blood of immune hosts to provide a cure to a pandemic - the Last Ship has already used this plot line). Even when I know films have ripped off stories from other films or TV Series I'm still prepared to go in with a forgiving mind-set, but only if what I'm watching is fun enough for these things not to matter, but that really isn't the case here.I got the feeling that the first film was a kids film and the second film was attempting a more mature approach than the first film; it feels like it's trying to be more intelligent than the first film, and whilst it succeeds in this respect to a certain extent this approach ultimately makes the film feel rather dull. Although it tries to set itself up as being intelligent it doesn't really succeed in that respect either (it tries to be intelligent, but the story is muddled, convoluted and incoherent making the film feel pretentious more than anything). Some of the cast members die and we're given a loose explanation of what is happening at the end, but I didn't have the same level of affection for them in this film as I did in the first film (probably because I wasn't given any reason to second time around).Simply put this film offers nothing in the way of excitement, tension, suspense or intrigue and to be fair these things were all on offer in the first film (albeit all of these things were offered only in moderation), but for Scorch Trials not to succeed in any of these areas and worse still for it to finish up being both boring and generic after such a promising opening is quite frankly unforgivable.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
42,sauravjoshi85,"Without proper backstory, the movie will disappoint you",5,27 April 2020,"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a science fiction movie directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brein, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki Hong Lee, Patricia Clarkson, Barry Pepper, Rosa Salazar and Giancarlo Esposito. The movie is second in the Maze Runner Trilogy.I haven't read the book so I will write my review purely on my viewing experience. I felt that this movie proves it's title as the characters are just running in the movie and story is been pushed in between their running.The movie gets boring and with cliche dialogues it increases your boredom. There are lots many loopholes in the movie. When they know that they are chased by WCKD why they still walking in the night that too in desert as desert could be very warm in the days but soothing cold in the night (Remember they have torches with them to guide in the night and the can easily switch of the torch whenever they hear any plane or copter is approaching). When they knew that they are hiding what is the point of switching on the lights while hiding in the shopping mall and let's say they on it by mistake they could've switched off it immediately instead of running like headless chicken (remember they have torches and emergency lights).The acting is ok but most of them were with flat faces. Screenplay is uneven and gets boring. The twist in the climax also doesn't excite much.Without proper backstory and execution this movie will surely disappoint you.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

44,lukem-52760,AN AWESOME & EXCITING APOCALYPTIC SCI-FI THRILLER,8,7 April 2020,"The Maze Runner films are an Awesome Trilogy & i think i like this part ""The Scorch Trials"" best.
Here Thomas & his crew are on the run into the dangerous desert wastelands called The Scorched Earth, a place full of Danger & most dangerous of all are the Infected humans who have turned into Zombie creatures called Cranks. These ""Cranks"" look Awesome & make for terrifying creatures that are out there ready to rip-apart any human. This film has a more Horror feel to it & that's why i loved it best. There's an incredible, intense & exciting sequence where Thomas & his gang are in a buried building in the sand & it's dark & scary & full of ferocious killer Cranks that chase them through the big old building/Mall type place & it's so intense & scary & a proper Horror movie scene.
The characters are all great again here, especially Thomas as the troubled leader of the group & we get, much later in the movie, a great Little role from Barry Pepper, one of the most underrated actors out there & one of my personal favourite actors ever!!! Here the always intense & rugged Barry Pepper plays a tough wasteland warrior named Vince & although it's a small part for Pepper it's a great role & he steals the show as soon as he's on screen.
Here Thomas must survive the scorched earth & evade the evil WKD empire. A thrilling adventure.The Scorch Trials is a blast of Action & Apocalyptic sci-fi Horror with a great ensemble cast & great effects.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
45,kluseba,Sinister survival story,8,21 June 2018,"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is the second part of the dystopian trilogy about a group of teenagers immune to a virus that has decimated humanity who are hunted by a shady organization. This great second part is an improvement over the solid first movie.First of all, this second movie is much more sinister than the first part as the teenagers have to fight creepy creatures roaming in an abandoned world. Especially the scenes in the mysterious underground shelter in the first third of the movie are quite intense. Overall, the varied locations add a lot of atmosphere to the film. Light and sound techniques are executed flawlessly. The creatures also look quite haunting.Secondly, the action sequences in this film are more intense than in the previous movie. One sequence that really stands out is when Thomas, the leader of the teenagers, and Brenda, the rebellious sister of one Thomas' deceased soulmates, have to fight their way through a shaky skyscraper with numerous traps. This sequence feels like a vivid roller coaster ride.Thirdly, the movie continues to develop the intriguing characters that made the first film so successful. Thomas is shown as brave leader who secretly doubts his capacities. Minho continues to convince as athletic, courageous and resilient young man. Newt represents the intellectual side as he always asks the right questions with a careful yet caring demeanor. In addition to this, the film introduces a few new characters that are quite intriguing. Aris is a quiet outsider who turns out being an observing and smart teenager who saves his new partners from certain death. Jorge is a resilient man with an unpredictable character who can be very caring about his friends in one scene but brutally torture former partners in the next scene. His protegee Brenda is a tough girl who doesn't shy away from conflicts with older men.Obviously, the movie also has a few minor flaws. The story is quite predictable. The film has two twists, one shown in the first third and the other one at the very end of the movie. Both of them are very predictable and the fact that the group of teenagers aren't immediately aware of them after everything they have gone through in the first installment, makes them look somewhat naive. Personally, I also dislike Teresa's character. She always seems cold, distant and manipulative and never truly helps her partners. She makes me think of Kristen Stewart, not only physically but also regarding her behavior. That isn't meant to be a compliment as it's impossible to empathize with her. Brenda is a much more distinctive female character while Teresa's character doesn't seem to be fully fleshed out.In the end, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is an improvement over a good first installment and makes you want to watch the third and final part right away. This film has great atmosphere, breathtaking action sequences and intriguing character development. Those who like dystopian science-fiction movies in the key of the Divergent or The Hunger Games franchises can't get around this franchise. Make sure you have watched the first part and to watch the third and final part later on.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
46,3xHCCH,"Rogues, Rebels and Zombies!",7,10 September 2015,"Almost exactly one year ago, the first ""Maze Runner"" film was released in local theaters. I thought that the action sequences within the maze scenes were all quite exciting and very entertaining to watch. However, after all the excellent suspense and tension built up in the first two- thirds of the film, at the end nothing really gets explained clearly. It felt like an incomplete film on its own. For those it gets interested though, this sequel is expected to give answers to questions raised in the first film.While under the care of a high-security facility, Thomas becomes increasingly suspicious of Janson, the man in charge. When he overhears a sinister plot hatching, he gets his fellow Gladers out to brave the arid desert called the Scorch outside. However, it was not only the elements they have to worry about, there were still a horde of killer zombies called the Cranks out there to contend with. Thomas and his gang survive the Scorch and unite with the rebel group in the mountains in order to fight the danger foisted on humanity by the increasingly mysterious Dr. Ava Paige and her WCKD organization.Dylan O'Brien continues his good portrayal of the ever-doubting Thomas. In this film, his character would need to make a lot of difficult decisions and O'Brien convinces us that he can make those hard choices. The other young actors in his gang do not really do too much to stand out. Aidan Gillen, the ever-slimy Littlefinger on ""Game of Thrones"" brings his smarmy charms in this film as the Rat-Man, Janson. One look at him and I cannot really separate him from his TV character. Rosa Salazar gives a strong performance as Brenda, a survivor within the city ruins whom Thomas encounters. She registers better on screen than the main female lead Kaya Scodelario, who plays Teresa. It was good to see another ""Game of Thrones"" actress in there, the attractive Nathalie Emmanuel, who plays Harriet, one of the rebels. Veteran actresses Lili Taylor and Patricia Clarkson lend class to their rival scientist characters, Mary Cooper and Ava Paige, respectively.The excitement build up strongly in the first act. However the second act in the Scorch felt a bit slow as the Cranks overstay their parts too long. Their horror scenes were effectively creepy at first but they get a bit too repetitive. A protracted hallucinatory party scene can also be quite head-scratching. The third act though hikes up the explosive climactic action and revives anticipatory audience excitement for the next installment. The production design of elaborate setup of the WCKD laboratory and the ruins of the huge city looked very good. At the end of the 130 minute running time, there are still a lot of questions about the true intentions of WCKD, or is that name alone already a giveaway clue?There was no more maze in this movie anymore for the characters to run through. However, the maze is for the viewer who has to try to absorb this whole labyrinthine dystopian world that James Dashner hatched in his novels. Director Wes Ball does his best to make the complex plot engaging, exciting and entertaining with some pretty well-executed action scenes. Overall, when compared to the first ""Maze Runner"", this sequel was the more satisfying film for me. 7/10.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
47,adamjohns-42575,Just good fun. Don't put so much pressure on films.,7,26 October 2021,"OK, so it's quite predictable, but I like the easy pace and simple story telling and I think that it's almost as good as the first.It still has a lot of similarities to 'The Hunger Games' and the ""Gents"" series (Insurgent, Etc), but now there are also hints of 'The Walking Dead', 'Star Wars', the new 'Star Trek's' and probably a lot of other things, but let's not forget that the world of 'Harry Potter' is full of creatures from all sorts of mythology and other fantasy books and films, so why shouldn't the author of these stories use what they've seen or read about too? And to be honest, it's probably more about the way it's filmed than the content that made me feel that way.Once again, it has that good, but not outstanding cast, and by that I mean that nobody steals the limelight. The direction takes our heroes where they need to go in a way that is not difficult to follow, which allows the viewer to enjoy it, without overthinking every thing that is happening.It's the type of film you can watch and play games on your phone at the same time, especially if you've seen it at least once, although my Nephews do this through everything.I do think that I have already kind of guessed the main big ending for the third film though, but I'm looking forward to finding out if I'm right, which is all part of the fun of these films isn't it? The guessing game. Who's going to betray who? How will they win? Do they need to win? And are they running from the wrong people? Are they running at all? I hope to have all the answers to these questions in film three, but worry that it will be rushed. I think that I may be biased by my nephew who turned his nose up when I said what we were going to watch and I hope that he is wrong.706.79/1000.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
48,Seraphion,"Okay as a part of the series, but with serious lack in the story development",6,13 October 2015,"Thomas wakes up finding himself and his friends of Maze survivors, or The Gladers; Newt, Frypan, Winston, Minho and Teresa, being saved by mercenaries from Cranks, humans infected by the Flare virus. They're taken to a facility lead by Janson where they meet fellow survivors of other Mazes. Every day they call some of the kids for relocation. One night, another survivor Aris wakes Thomas up and reveals to him that the kids called before are being unconscious. He overhears Janson talk to his colleague Ava Paige, about them working for World Catastrophe Killzone Department or WCKD, and about them searching for the resistance The Right Arm. This prompts Thomas to take The Gladers out of the facility. They escape their pursuers and enter a building. But the Cranks chase them and Winston hold their escape route, getting himself clawed by the Cranks. The next day The Gladers leave Winston with a gun as he tells them he doesn't want to change into a Crank.That night Thomas brings The Gladers to another building where they meet a girl Brenda who brings them to a band of survivors lead by Jorge. Jorge distrusts the group and holds them in chains. But suddenly Janson and his WCKD arrive, so Jorge runs the building's self destruct mechanism. Thomas and Brenda gets separated but she tells him that they must find a man named Marcus because he'll be the one Jorge's heading to to take The Gladers to The Right Arm. Thomas and Brenda follow an underground path but the run into Cranks. They run into a spot where Brenda falls but gets held by a window. A Crank assaults her on the cracking glass so Thomas breaks it to let the Crank fall while pulling Brenda up. They reach Marcus's place but they don't find him. The man on the door tells them to drink a concoction as admittance fee to the place. Inside, the concoction makes Thomas and Brenda hallucinate. As they kiss, Thomas backs down due to thinking of Teresa. Thomas then passes out.Waking up, he finds Jorge and the rest of the Gladers there already, while Jorge beats the man on the door, who's actually Marcus himself. Marcus eventually spills information, so the group takes off with his car to The Right Arm's location. Reaching the place, they get barraged by gunshots. Two female soldiers corners them but they recognize Aris so they lead them to The Right Arm's leader Vincent. Brenda was actually bitten by the Crank before, and her infection starts to kick in. The Right Arm's doctor stops Vincent from killing her as she recognizes Thomas. That night Teresa reveals to Thomas that she works for WCKD all along. WCKD helicopters storms the place and all of them get caught. But Jorge comes with a car and wrecks the place, so the WCKD flees, capturing Minho. On the aftermath, Thomas decides to go back and rescue Minho.As part of a series, the story surely provided a nice addition. Changing the background world setting objectively from the enclosed environment in the Maze to the possibility of the deadly open world did great in expanding the horizons and scope the audience should have in viewing this as a series. Introducing new story ingredients such as the Cranks in emphasize, and finally materializing the WCKD as object to put the major blame is a move that the audience awaits, especially for those like me who haven't touched the book yet. But as a standalone movie, the movie sure has those things as its major flaw, especially if we put them in comparison to the first movie. The Maze Runner (2014) was thick with the environment's mystery, story unpredictability and also strong tensions in character relationships. I really like how the movie focused on the competition between the Gladers whereas they should be cooperating.But this movie is devoid of those three things. The environment still has an awe factor, but it's all about the CGI. The environment in this movie literally lost its charm, gets linear and easily anticipated. The only cool place is where Thomas helps Brenda by breaking the window. The story also gets so linear that it became quite predictable for me. The worst is the tensions in character relationships wither into just puny arguments between Thomas and Newt. The last twist with Teresa is surely predictable when you link Teresa being called on her first day and the fact that WCKD finds Jorge's place very easily. The acting overall is just at the same level with The Maze Runner, nothing that special. Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Thomas Brodie- Sangster, and Kaya Scodelario did nothing more than reprising their roles, minus the tensions their character had in the first movie. I'm in fact quite taken by Aidan Gillen's role which hold the mystery level so not to seep out entirely off this movie. Patricia Clarkson and Nathalie Emmanuel's roles may hold more potential for the third installment.My say for Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials (2015) is that it still retains its predecessor's score of 6 out of 10. A recommendation only goes out if you're, like me, someone who like to follow a story all to the end.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Unfortunately, the second one was too big and choked.

50,chrichtonsworld,Again an epic adventure that puts you on the edge of your seat!,9,18 November 2015,Now with some mysteries solved Thomas and his gang adjust to their new environment only to find out they have been tricked again.It takes only a few minutes for Thomas to figure out something is really wrong and from that point he rolls from one event to another. Where in the original the location for the most part was fixed and constrained now we get to see a glimpse of the real world out there and it is not pretty. Part of the enjoyment is not knowing what comes next so I will not reveal too much. What I do want to mention is that more and more Thomas seems to be embracing his leader qualities and a lot of people gladly want to follow him. I personally love these kinds of things since it makes it interesting for me. Like in the original this film is filled with great action sequences and thrills. If you were thinking that it would be hard to top the original in that department think again. Maze Runner: Scorch Trials is bigger and better throughout. While the overall tone is still quite serious more humour is added to the mix providing some welcome laughs. However some of the quieter moments do feel a little forced and I wished they would have made better use of them to deepen the characters a little more. Not that it is needed much since you do learn enough about them to know where they stand. The ending of this film sets up the third one quite nicely and again it makes me look forward to what it has to offer.One remark I have to add. I read some reviews where book fans are outraged. Apparently the films don't follow the books as they should have. Now I understand that this can be very infuriating and frustrating. But as someone who has not read the books I have found myself enjoying these films since whether they are poor adaptations or not they are incredible enjoyable movies in their own right. Well made blockbuster action adventure films like these are very rare these days so I will embrace them wholeheartedly if they come along. Trust me on this if such a movie is crap then I will be among the first to critique the hell out of them.But main point is that Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials like the original is immensely fun. And that ladies and gentlemen is important too. A must watch!,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
51,one9eighty,Average sequel to a decent first film,5,4 February 2019,"This is the second movie in the Maze Runner trilogy, the 'Gladers' are out of the maze - they are being housed in a facility where they believe they are safe. It's not until Thomas starts asking questions of his surroundings that he discovers they are in yet another WCKD place, so a break out is made. Once free they journey on the dangerous, yet open road. Rather than just fleeing to safety the intention is to traverse ""the scorch"", a barren terrain with unimaginable dangers, and search for clues about WCKD and their evil motivations. Along the way they meet the remains of humanity and experience different emotions to boot.I have to admit, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first film in the trilogy - the first one was new and unique, this felt as I had seen it before - or at least seen a grown up version of it (I just can't quite put my finger on what film I'm thinking of). Cross a college movie with a watered down Mad-Max film and you are heading in the right direction.The acting is decent although not outstanding. The scripting is not too complex, and points are repeated over and over so you won't get lost if you come into this film having skipper the first film. Action and CGI are authentic enough. And those are the positives - the big negative; if you have read the book - avoid this film like the Flare virus, it'll leave you angry at home much liberty has been taken with a decent source material.Average.

It didn't help that there were only three to four characters from the first one that were memorable enough that I cared about them in this one.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
53,Anurag-Shetty,Not as engaging as its predecessor.,7,1 October 2015,"Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials continues with the adventures of Thomas(Dylan O'Brien). After everything they endured in the Maze, Thomas, Minho(Ki Hong Lee), Teresa(Kaya Scodelario), Newt(Thomas Brodie-Sangster) & Frypan(Dexter Darden) get rescued from the organization known as WCKD. The man who rescues them from WCKD introduces himself as Jansen(Aidan Gillen). Jansen says he's here to help. However, Thomas suspects there's more to him than meets the eye. Thomas & his friends realize that Jansen & company are not who they say they are. Thomas uncovers a sinister future for him & the rest of the Gladers. The Gladers successfully escape but, now they face the insurmountable hurdles of the Scorch. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a good movie. However, I liked The Maze Runner(2014) better. The 2014 original is more thrilling, suspenseful & had more heart. This film is more about the chase sequences & action set pieces. There is some suspense in the film but, nothing that will keep you guessing right till the end, like in the original. I missed memorable characters like, Chuck & Gally from the first installment. Most of the new characters in The Scorch Trials don't leave any lasting impression. The Scorch Trials does surpass The Maze Runner(2014) in one aspect. I found the monsters in this movie more intimidating than the Grievers from the original. The special effects of the movie are great. The 3D is nothing special & seems more like an excuse to make extra money. Dylan O'Brien is superb as Thomas. Ki Hong Lee is awesome as Minho. Kaya Scodelario is brilliant as Teresa. Thomas Brodie-Sangster is amazing as Newt. Dexter Darden is effective as Frypan. Alexander Flores is great as Winston. Jacob Lofland is impressive as Aris Jones. Alan Tudyk is outstanding in his cameo as Blondie. The characters that needed to be more fleshed out are Brenda(Rosa Salazar), Jorge(Giancarlo Esposito), Ava Paige(Patricia Clarkson) & Jansen. However, Rosa Salazar, Giancarlo Esposito, Patricia Clarkson & Aidan Gillen do a fantastic job with the limited screen time they're given. I hope they're given more screen time in the final film. Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a must watch for fans of the books & the first film. However, go for it with slightly lowered expectations.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
54,fernandoschiavi,"Full of action and with a great production dsigner and visual effects, The Scorch Trials happily points to darker paths in episodic acts",7,20 March 2021,"Maze Runner proved that it could be one of the recent hits amid so many children's adaptations around Hollywood. After the good performance of ""Maze Runner"" in 2014, it was not long before 20th Century Fox gave the green light for the adaptation of the second book of the trilogy created by James Dasher. As soon as they left the premiere, the entire team on that tape has already started working on this ""Maze Runner - Trial of Fire"", in a rush that did not affect the final result of the production.""The maze was just the beginning"". This time the marketing campaign is not exaggerating: while Maze Runner - Run or Die, it brought a single scenario and a precise obstacle (to overcome the maze). Now Thomas, Teresa, Minho and the other young people have to deal with a very different reality: The Earth's surface has been burned by the sun, they must combat an infinite number of mortal dangers. When they escape from scientists, they must survive the desert crossing, when they pass through this stage, they must deal with misshapen creatures called Cranks, then with rebels, then a lightning storm that seems specifically aimed at them. All the people, beings and machines around want to kill them; every shed that could house the group hides new traps. The world is really cruel.In this context, Maze Runner: Trial of Fire considerably expands its universe to become a great action film, with many special effects combined with the rules of other genres (zombie films, post-apocalyptic films, catastrophe films, teenage adventures). This production has a larger budget, and also broader ambitions, aiming to seduce the adult action audience. Unlike the tense and gloomy ambience built with great care in the predecessor iteration, here we already see the unspeakable influence of futuristic dystopias that, without a doubt, begin to draw more parallels with audiovisual and even literary franchises that began in the last century and last in a saturated way until today. The result is agile and technically impressive, however, in the desire to please everyone, perhaps it will not delve into any genre.Again directed by Wes Ball and scripted by T.S. Nowlin, the feature begins exactly where its predecessor left off, with no introduction for newcomers to the franchise - that is, it is necessary to watch ""Run or Die"" before venturing here. Upon discovering that their ""saviors"" work for the CRUEL organization and that they would be used in a scientific experiment, the boys flee the place where they were placed, discovering that the outside world has turned into an inhospitable place, where the climate and the people affected by a virus that turns them into zombies makes the survival of the group doubtful, to say the least. In search of contacting a resistance group to CRUEL, Thomas and his friends find the young Brenda (Rosa Salazar) and her tutor Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito), survivors in the midst of this post-apocalyptic scenario that serve almost as guides for them in this not admirable new scenario.By opening the film with a prologue that shows how Thomas ended up in the hands of CRUEL and further developing the interior of the organization headed by pragmatic Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson), the script adds depth to the conflict between the gladers and their pursuers, something that makes Teresa's dramatic arc (Kaya Scodelario) become much more intriguing and even tragic, making this plot the best of the film, mainly due to the young Scodelario's compositional work, effective every time it is triggered - and it is a pity that she no longer has screen time. That's because Thomas's dilemmas are certainly the film's weak point. The character of Dylan O'Brien continues to lead the group with his inexhaustible arsenal of virtues: he is intelligent, charitable, beautiful, friendly, courageous, tireless, he devises the best plans, runs like no one and never leaves anyone behind. Even if the person in question already has a certain death, Thomas prefers to risk his own life to accompany the dying person. As he always makes the right decisions, without hesitation - unlike Katniss or Tris - the hero becomes uninteresting, somewhat superficial. Fortunately, O'Brien is an actor with resources, bringing some hesitations to this bastion of morals and good manners.Wes Ball maintains the level of the previous production, only this time he is a little more restrained. If before we had a camera shaking all the time and quick cuts, now the director is betting on the most agile and frantic narrative. Along with the script by T.S. Nowlin and Dan Zimmerman's editing, Ball's conducting works very well, not letting the film bummer when you link one action scene to the other or even not making room for many expository dialogues. On the other hand, the production continues to insist on excessive suspense as a resource to prepare the ground for a sequence - which, obviously, ends up hampering the progress of history. At one point in the projection, for example, one of the characters tells Thomas that he asks a lot of questions. In a way, this is how we stay for a good part of the tape: full of doubts, because we are being introduced to a series of new elements all the time, but they are not very well explained. At first, this tactic may even work, producing some effectiveness; when we reach the middle of the film, however, the resource begins to irritate and, in a way, leaves the viewer lost due to the amount of new elements that are being inserted without the slightest elucidation.Despite the rush to set the tone of the narrative, there is an interesting plot behind this rampant pursuit. While the first part of the trilogy focused on allegories such as the myth of the cave and themes taken from ""The Lord of the Flies"", here the central plot is based on an inversion of the natural order, with the elders seeking to kill (or ""harvest"" "") The youngest to try to survive and recover the old social order. Children have their roles demarcated from an early age by adults and a role to follow, not being given the right to choose their own destiny, but through struggle and rebellion.The great difference of this second film is its episodic character, which approximates the plot of a sadistic video game. Assuming that the audience already knows the characters, the action develops without any brakes, bringing each new segment with its scenery, its characters, its ""villain"" to overcome, as in the stages of a game. Overcoming that danger, young people are ready to run to the next trap. Perhaps this frantic road movie lacks a sense of purpose: where do the characters really intend to go, if nothing around is trustworthy? Among the post-apocalyptic worlds of children's books, none is as bitter and nihilistic as that of Maze Runner.In adults, the highlight is Giancarlo Esposito, who embodies a survivor with a spark of humanity within him, represented by the love he has for Brenda. Aiden Gillen, on the other hand, maintains the sinister and seductive kind that he presents in the ""Game of Thrones"" series. Patricia Clarkson this time has time to develop her Ava Paige, the ever-expanding Alan Tudyk basically caricatures a drug dealer, while Barry Pepper and Lili Taylor basically bridge the gap as the leaders of the resistance.Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is also interesting and slightly superior to the first, but it has silly flaws in its content, problems that could be solved with a better observation of the script. Among the nonsense seen in its long duration, I mention some that are difficult to swallow: there is a scene in which an armed boy revolves using bullets against oncoming security guards instead of shooting the lock that holds the exit door. It also sounds forced to flee quickly to a mall very close to the premises, and the place is not even surveyed by the soldiers, even though they know that the young people have just escaped into a desert storm and are looking for shelter. And then the scene in which Brenda (Rosa Salazar) is supported by a glass - similar to what happened to Julianne Moore in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997) -, and it starts to crack with each movement of the girl, but it doesn't break when a Crank falls on top and there is a fight on the spot. Not to mention the fact that young people run away from the laboratory and spend days in the desert without food and little water...While in the first film, the production design and the action scenes were praised for their originality, here Wes Ball decides to appeal to something more common. Despite the correct design of the CRUEL installation, the post-apocalyptic world of ""Maze Runner"" is not very different from that seen in the ""Mad Max"" franchise, for example. Even the zombies and the set pieces themselves involving the creatures seem to be pulled from the game ""The Last of Us"", with the filmmaker showing a worrying lack of originality in his second feature. However, we must praise the battle that marks the third act of production, very well conducted.Towards the end, the production happily points to darker paths, with mention of sex, drugs, bloody fights and some morally questionable decisions. The target audience remains the teenager, but director Wes Ball's ability to suggest adult ideas within the PG-13 censorship is commendable. The characters would become much more complex if they let their adolescent drives flow in this extreme war scenario. In addition, the announcement of the third film as a ""revenge story"" looks promising. If the writers manage to create a cohesive story and reduce Manichaeism, the third Maze Runner may indeed represent the culmination of this story. After all, the franchise discusses important topics, such as the exchange of freedom for security, the limit of the intervention of science in nature and the role of the single state in relation to the will of individuals. We just need to find space to develop all these ideas in the midst of so much rush.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

56,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not nearly as engaging as The Maze Runner, but above all a decent enough sequel",6,12 February 2018,"Since The Maze Runner: The Death Cure came out two weeks ago, I'm going to review the second installment of The Maze Runner franchise that started with the first one. The original Maze Runner deviated from the young-adult romance trope that plagued the recent adaptations after Twilight ended and it received mixed-to-positive reviews. While fans of the book series either hated it or found it ok, it was considered by many to be a much better young-adult adaptation. It had mystery, it had thrills, it had action and it had emotion. People liked it and so did I. Then, a year later back in 2015, I saw the sequel hoping it would live up to the first film, but while it was a decent enough sequel, it did disappoint me and I understand the mixed reaction from both critics and fans of the second book ""The Scorch Trials"".There are some positives that worked in the film. The cinematography is really gorgeous including the buildings and the actual desert, not to mention it's solid make-up and CGI effects on the Cranks. 61 million dollars went into the production and much like the first film, it was well spent. John Paesano, who scored the first film, did another solid job in delivering the same stuff he did from the atmosphere to the action music. Wes Ball, who directed the first film, delivered another top-notch direction. Also, the acting continues to be great with Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden, Alexander Flores, Ki Hong Lee, and Patricia Clarkson continuing to deliver excellent performances as did the new supporting cast including Giancarlo Esposito, Alan Tudyk, Rosa Salazar, and Aidan Gillen as the Rat Man, Jorge, and Brenda. And then, there's the action sequences which are more intense and action-packed including the chase scenes. Those set pieces alone are worth watching if anyone else checks the movie out on DVD.That being said, there are some drawbacks that disappointed those who loved the first film and the book series. First, there's the writing, which sadly does feel a bit weak and borrows sources from other zombie-genre related stuff. Not only that, it deviated from the second book despite having some bits of elements which caused an outrage to fans. Also, while the film delivered on the action and thrills, it lacked the mystery and emotion that made the first film work. Not to mention the plot and character development were severely lacking. The new characters were well introduced, but no depth was given to them. Then, there's the pacing which is sadly another weak element to the film. I don't mind two hour films but only when they have development for the characters. The original film had brisk pacing and took it's time for Thomas to interact with the other Gladers and becoming a really great leader and those characters were the ones you cared about. There's some of it here but not enough considering the weak writing and it's deviation from the source material.Overall, The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is a decent enough sequel and it delivered what it promised in the trailers, but sadly, it wasn't nearly as engaging as the first film. I haven't seen The Death Cure yet, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed it would be an improvement. 3/5",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
57,abisio,More entertaining than the first one but not quite different from the book,9,16 September 2015,I really loved The Maze Runner so much that immediately bought and read the the three first books I liked second and third; but not as much as the first installment. I did not read the fourth because is basically a prequel.The Scorch Trials (the movie ) is quite different from the second book and it includes characters from the third like Vince; and many situations and characters are different. ***some spoilers below***. While the book makes of the crossing of the dessert another trial; the movie take it as an escape. The book is not too clear about the Right Arm (and Vince itself) here are just rebels fighting against WICKED. Jensen character is more ambiguous in the book than the movie. The Cranks are just humans destroyed by madness; the movie show them as almost mutants or zombies. Jorge and Brenda are immures in the book and had their own agenda. On the plus side; action is quite heavier and more terrifying than the book. The scenes with the Cranks are frightening and very well staged. The destroyed buildings background is impressve. In any case; this is an action packed movie (far more than the book) and much more clear about what is really happening. Something that the books never really clarifies too much.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
58,silvermistvio,"The foundation is changed. Yet, it turned out to be great.",10,13 May 2019,"People are pointing out that this film does not follow the novel. The screenwriter changed the entire plot. I haven't read the novel yet, so, I don't know what they are saying is true or not. But as for me, this film is also very good to enjoy.The disease known as the Flare is something that attacks the brain, but it isn't a zombie virus. People who infected by that disease will not turn into Zombies. But in this film, they changed the basis plot and turned into Zombie film. I'm not saying it's not good. I like Zombie films but changing the foundation isn't cool. If it's not Zombie in the novel, then it shouldn't be Zombie in the film too. That's the law.Anyway, except for the fact, everything is fine. The original score, the acting, the directing, the sound edition, special effects and all, everything's perfect. There are some scenes that make you excited. Those scenes can really make you excited. That's why I love this film.

59,bryank-04844,This is how you do a young adult adaptation.,8,16 September 2015,"A year later, we have the sequel to the popular young adult novel series 'The Maze Runner' with 'The Scorch Trials'. in my previous discussion about the first film, first time director Wes Ball certainly knew how to film and construct some excellent action sequences that were highly suspenseful and kept the adrenaline flowing like vicious rapids. That being said, the first film had its issues with pacing and dialogue, which is the same problem with the sequel.However, Ball has more or less switched genres on us with this sequel and made this more of a straight horror movie than anything else. 'The Scorch Trials' is an intense ride from start to finish as we pick up where the last film left off with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Newt (Thomas Brodie Sanger), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), being picked up by a military team and brought to a safe haven (or so it seems) where they meet other kids their age. However, something isn't right here as Aris (Jacob Lofland) tells Thomas this place has a sinister motive and that they need to escape. Sure enough, some diabolical things are happening here as Thomas and his crew along with some newcomers manage to escape into the ""Scorch"", which is desert wasteland of what was once Earth. This is where things go full on horror mode in the vein of '28 Days Later'.We finally get to see what W.C.K.D. (or as the kids pronounce as ""wicked"") has up their sleeves and their ultimate plan is. From here, Thomas and his friends come across gangsters, infected zombies, and resistance fighters to try and destroy W.C.K.D., which is still led by Ava (Patricia Clarkson) and her right hand man Janson (Aidan Gillen). Not only do Thomas and his friends have to escape from the evil forces of W.C.K.D., but they have to avoid these infected people who are a mash-up between the zombies in '28 Days Later' and the infected in 'I Am Legend'. If Ball knows how to do anything well, it's a chase and escape action sequence, which luckily, this film has several segments of.Each one of these scenes is terrifying, thrilling, and scary as hell. I found myself on the edge of my seat and not breathing regularly during these sequences. It's that much fun. Not only that, but it seems like some fun movie stars wanted to get in on the 'Maze Runner' action with some great cameos, including Giancarlo Esposito, Lili Taylor, Barry Pepper, and Alan Tudyk to name a few. Running at over two hours, this film could have been trimmed down just a tiny bit, however there is enough thrilling action to keep your attention during the longer than needed run time.Despite a few pacing problems here and there with some less than desired dialogue, 'The Scorch Trials' was insanely fun and with it's signature twist towards the end, as well as a big set up for the third and final film (thank the gods they are not splitting the final movie into two segments), I'm definitely looking forward to the third movie. I'm curious to see if the Blu-ray version will have a rated 'R' version of the film, because there are some moments here where things get truly horrific. This is how you do a young adult adaptation.Recommended!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
60,vampire_hounddog,"""Go, go, go""",3,25 August 2020,"Rescued and having survived the Maze from the first film, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his friends have been rounded up after a virus has wiped out most of humanity. They are kept in a secure underground facility where scientists seek a cure and believe that these kids hold the secret to immunity. When they find out what will become of them, they escape, trying to avoid storms, zombies and renegades.In some respects, more interesting than the first film, this sequel to the 2014 original bares little relation to James Dashner's book so popular among teen readers which disappointed many of its fans. Instead it is a playbook of such post apocalyptic franchises as the RESIDENT EVIL, MAD MAX and THE HUNGER GAMES films that involves a lot of running around and irritable repetitive dialogue of folk shouting ""go, go, go"", ""let's go"" or ""move, move, move"" to the point of irritation.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

62,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,27 January 2018,"Wes Ball continues as the director of the Maze Runner franchise and counts with T. S. Nowlin to help him with the book-to-movie adaptation of The Scorch Trials.The second installment picks up right where the first one ended. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers keep searching for clues about the real purpose of WCKD while teaming up with a resistance group of survivors in the middle of the Scorch, a destroyed landscape with virus-infected humans.The Scorch Trials had a tough task to start its story considering that the ending of the first film is pure nonsense and the reason why I almost did not rate it positively. However, The Maze Runner has several points in its favor and I felt entertained throughout the movie until the last 15 minutes. With this in mind, the first half of this film surprised me a lot!The Scorch Trials starts off strong and it does not take long for the Gladers to become aware of their ""situation"" and to synchronize with the viewers' knowledge. Thankfully, the stupid ending of the first movie does not spread for too long either and Wes Ball entertained the hell out of me for one hour-ish (the other hour is when the problems start to arise and develop). He has an outstanding eye for action, there are some amazing chasing sequences that honestly left me jaw-dropped. They are riveting, tense and the camera work is incredible, even the shaky cam is very well-handled.The cinematography transforms the visual quality of this film, even though it lost its claustrophobic atmosphere that I loved in the first movie. Still, it is a damn good looking film with great editing and an excellent score. This time around, the ending at least makes sense and it effectively finishes the movie, instead of completely destroying its story like in the previous one.One of the exceptional features of the first movie is the cast and everyone that keeps portraying their roles in this one becomes even better. Dylan O'Brien is astonishing once again. I mean, this guy is extraordinary, he has a great range of expressions and he easily connects with the audience. Thomas is also the most important piece of the trilogy since everything is based on him, what he did and what he means for the future of the world, so it is a perfect match between actor and character.Kaya Scodelario plays a more active Teresa and she definitely raises the story. Her character is basically a plot device in the first film, but now she is well-developed and she actually has something to do. Teresa's path throughout the movie follows an interesting progression and there are a few cool twists along the way, even if they are a bit predictable.Ki Hong Lee (Minho) and Thomas Sangster (Newt) also have neat performances, but here is where the film starts to crumble. There are a lot of new characters introduced in this movie and some of them are actually portrayed by well-known actors. For example, Aidan Gillen (Janson) and Giancarlo Esposito (Jorge), from the famous Game Of Thrones and Breaking Bad. With so many talents added to the cast, it is a pity that their characters are not developed at all ...The second half of the film entirely changes the movie and it turns into something I've seen a thousand times in action films. It lost its originality and mystery that it possessed, it stopped looking like an intriguing story. It is literally based on running from point A to B with big action scenes in exchange for character development. There is never a sense of urgency until the last 15 minutes and since the characters just appear from nowhere, I can't care for any of them. The new characters who I enjoyed watching, I did due to the actors portraying them, not because the characters were great.Consequently, the movie's tone and pacing are deeply affected. The balance between action and story-development is not adjusted at all, the movie goes from one running scene to another with barely any storytelling in between. It is entertaining for the first 45 minutes or so, but the second act slows down and it holds too many cliche sequences for me to tolerate.All in all, The Scorch Trials starts off great, with some amazing chasing scenes and phenomenal direction from Wes Ball. The nonsense ending from the first film is quickly put aside in the first act and the original cast improve on their already excellent performances from the first movie, especially Dylan O'Brien. Technically great in regards to cinematography, editing and score, but very disappointing story-wise. The second half feels like a cliche action movie with rarely decent storytelling, consequently breaking its pacing and tone. Some new characters should have added something more to the story, but they end up not being developed at all and The Maze Runner franchise wastes its potential once again.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

64,dfa120374,Good Enough But Lacks The Entertainment The First Film Had,5,3 March 2016,"I'm going to start off by using an old cliché...this sequel is decent enough, but it's definitely not as good as the first film. I know - that's not a very original thing to say, but as with a lot of sequels, it's true. In fact, this second movie ends up being a bit of a disappointment in a way because it starts off well enough, but from about the 70-80 minute mark it just starts to drag as if it was deliberately stretched out. It's definitely a movie of two halves so to speak and it's really what happens in that first half that makes me give it the rating I did, but only just because if it carried on much longer, I think it would have dropped.The first movie had pretty much everything a good Sci-Fi Action/Thriller should have...a decent amount of good action, plenty of suspense & atmosphere, an enjoyable story, and keeps you watching. This sequel starts off with pretty much all of those, but it definitely fades away in the last third. The action completely nose-dives and the story takes a bit of a ridiculous turn for me because :::::SPOILER ALERT::::: for Thomas to change his mind and want to go back to where they all started after everything they all went through is a huge WTF moment. That's a bit like Hilts in The Great Escape wanting to go back to get revenge on the Germans after he and his crew escaped from the POW camp they were in.As I said earlier, the rating I've given this film is purely because of the first two thirds...they kept it interesting with a decent amount of suspense so why deviate from what was making it an enjoyable to something you'd find in a boring slow-paced Drama was disappointing.If you've not read the books (like me) then you might quite enjoy this film generally for what it is, but if you've read the books you'll probably hate it because I've read that this film goes completely off-track from what happens in the book.Why? Well, only the film makers can tell us that.A decent enough film, but still disappointing.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

66,SquigglyCrunch,A Solid Sequel to a Solid Movie,7,13 October 2015,"Having enjoyed the first Maze Runner movie, I was pretty excited for this one. I didn't plan on seeing it in theaters, but did anyways. It wasn't as good as the Maze Runner, but it was still solid. The characters could have used some work, and although the action didn't leave a heck of a lot of room for conversation, the runtime could have been extended to allow for such scenes. Some characters I didn't even remember, or was never introduced to in the first place. Nevertheless, there was enough to keep you interested in them. The Scorch Trials, of course, continues where the Maze Runner ended off. It follows a similar pattern to the first movie, where it reveals a little and ends still without a full explanation and a cliffhanger. This one was a little more blatant about the fact that the series would continue, and that the next movie would be similar to this one. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to it. The replacement Grievers, called Cranks, were interesting enough. Compared to most creatures of their type nowadays they were different. Their design was unique and although the general rules surrounding them weren't really altered, they still created good, entertaining action. Overall, the Scorch Trials is far from amazing, and not as good as its predecessor, but once again shows confidence in its ability to continue as a series. Typically a sequel to a movie like the Maze Runner means that they will continue either way, but nonetheless it's good to see yet another display of confidence. If you liked the Maze Runner, then chances are you'll enjoy the Scorch Trials. It's epic, interesting, and sets up to make a solid book-based trilogy, which is rare these days. It's a sequel that succeeds, even if it's only by a bit. If you liked Maze Runner, or are interested, then I suggest checking it out.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
67,johannes2000-1,This Maze Runner without a maze is a dissapointment.,5,1 February 2021,"After the exciting first movie, this was a bit of a dissapointment. The maze itself was the biggest asset of #1, and here, in spite of the continued use of the original title, there's no sign of any maze, but for a big part of the movie the group wanders through endless desert-like dunes, to at last turn up in an equalley uninspiring camp-ground. Luckily in between there are some exciting scenes in a wasted city-center. But another bummer: no threatening giant monsters, just lame zombie-like people.Then there were these numerous illogical things, like the group being followed from the air, but still they walk unhindered like conspicuous sitting ducks in broad daylight along the open dunes or sit at night around blazing campfires. And the wanderings are evidently supposed to take many days, but we never see them find, or even want for food and water.Anyway, as an action movie it's okay, and I'm a big fan of Dylan O'Brien, but as a worthy sequel to The Maze Runner it fails, here it's all in all just some kids endlessly on the run for some bad people, nothing more.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I thought I wasn't going to enjoy this franchise but I really dig it. This second film does a decent job of continuing the mythology and mystery while it expands the world it exists in, develops the lead character and provides some very intense and exciting action. The only downsides I found was that a lot of characters go horribly underdeveloped and are basically used as plot devices, the running time feels a little longer than it needs to be and it makes the entire film feel like it is unsure where exactly it should stop and provide an ending that is satisfying enough but also gets you pumped for the final film and there were some action sequences that were hard to watch due to lighting and a shaky cam that was a little too shaky.

But why do we have to have zombie like ""monsters"" all of a sudden, are they zombies, we never really get to know what they are or why or how, we get bits and pieces, if they are saving the whole story for a third I am not so sure it will work.It does have some entertainment value, and we do get more of the story and the plot behind it all, but we are missing the creativity and fresh feeling that the first film provided.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Now they find themselves in the Scorch, a desolate landscape where unimaginable obstacles await. The powerful, mysterious group known as the WCKD seems to be behind it all - and, joining with a group of resistance fighters, the Gladers look for clues behind this sinister organization.So I've just seen ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" and it was pretty average. Theses a lot of things that I liked in the movie and these a lot I didn't like. Dylan O'Brine did a decent job playing the main lead in the movie, as he basically carried this whole movie just like in the first movie. The first 20 minutes of this movie was pretty dam good and I was very engaged on what was happening on screen. The action scenes and the cinematography in the movie was pretty damn good. This is a good looking but at the same time cruel looking movie.Now for the bad: The movie is a bit predictable at times even in it's action scenes and the story itself. The movie dose feel rushed at times with are main characters quickly going to one place to the other just like that, and I think it's something to do with it's pasting as it jumps ahead a lot. I didn't mind some of the CGI when it was used best in the backgrounds of a clear view of the waste land, but the cgi used on the creatures looked extremely fake and completely took me out of the movie. Of course the movie ends on that 'you got to wait for that third one', dick tease that everyone doesn't question why movies have to end like that.Overall Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials was a decent watch.

75,ArchonCinemaReviews,"A cohesive narrative with a clear vision, unencumbered by creative conflict and changes personal taste.",7,12 January 2016,"Once again The Maze Runner distinguishes itself as the superior YA film adaptation. This time it is The Scorch Trials that out muscles and out stories the inferior Hunger Games.Scorch Trials picks up where the first film lets off. The survivors of the maze are picked up by a helicopter that is supposed to bring them to safety. But audience members know the truth, that the WCKD organization's grasp is still tightly wound around fate of these youths. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers are brought to a facility where they quickly discover that their maze wasn't the only testing location. Realizing that WCKD is still around them, they escape to an unprotected land known as the Scorch, a deserted wasteland filled with unexpected dangers. While there they team up with resistance fighters, hoping to once and for all rid destroy WCKD's power.Admittedly, I never read The Maze Runner series, so I can't really compare the film to the book. In a way, that makes me better at critiquing and reviewing the Scorch Trials as a film, untainted by expectations and bias. As a film, The Maze Runner's second film is exciting and atmospheric, well acted and engaging to the final minute.The luck and benefit of adapting a novel into a film is that the major plot trajectory and holes have already been ironed out for you. Sure, you can take creative liberties as you truncate the story for the cinema, but you really have to obliterate it beyond recognition to destroy the cohesiveness as a film. The smartest thing executives behind this franchise did was keep the same screenwriter (T.S. Nowlin) and director (Wes Ball) across both films. What you get is a cohesive narrative with a clear vision, unencumbered by creative conflict and changes personal taste.Wes Ball is really great at capturing the atmosphere of a wasteland without making the environment feel cheap. Ball knows the story and characters and it translates in the care he has for the material. Following the plot, I very rarely was left wondering or with the inclination that what I was watching was changed from the original source material. It's common knowledge that the film would be simplified in comparison, as is true for nearly all book adaptations to film, but Nowlin captures the essence without sacrificing substance.In flying under the radar and in the shadow of the blockbuster marketing endeavor known as The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner has set itself up for an understated success. Knowing that the films have changed the story slightly from that of James Dashner's novel, I'm curious to see how the resolution fares in the final film – The Death Cure.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

It would have been believable if not for the incredibly evil sounding Irishman leader Mr Janson. Hearing him talk, you know all this ""safe haven for the kids"" is bull. And yes a short while later we find out that the kids have been actually captured by WCKD again and are about to get their brains drained. Something about some fluid in the brain and some mutation virus caused by solar flares. No answers are given of course and in true teenage fashion, the kids rebel against the controlling adults and venture forth into the burnt out desert wasteland city known as ""the scorch"".From then on, the movie starts to resemble Dawn of the Dead: Post Apocalypse, or ""I am Legend: Teenage Edition"". There are zombies in dark tunnels and the kids only have themselves to rely on. Then they run into other humans. Some of them want to sell them, some want to broker a deal, some want their help in fighting back against WCKD. Evil organisation, resistance group, wasteland survivors, zombies, that's it! This is Uwe Boll's Fallout 3. It's like the writer started binge gaming after the success of MAZE RUNNER and just threw in what he liked about the various post apocalyptic games he played.The characters don't change much other than for Thomas, the designated hero. At least he goes from the confused mess he was in the last movie to the confused leader of a confused group in this movie. The rest are calafare at best, accessories to Thomas' journey. At least they go beyond being mere token minorities for the sake of diversity and actually contribute to the story in a crucial way.Amidst the clichés, boring characters and overly shaky cinematography, THE SCORCH TRIALS at least manages to hold on to its constant sense of tension in its second and third acts. Foe after foe comes at our young heroes, each one deadlier than the last. You have some magnificent set pieces showing off the post apocalyptic landscape in its full glory and at no time could I tell the practical sets from the CGI. But after a while, you sort of accept that these youngsters have olympic level stamina and can still look pretty escaping through sewers, trudging through ruins and hiding in holes. Kudos to the writer for continuing the ""maze like"" elements from he first movie, hence justifying the need to leave ""Maze Runner"" in the title. Sure, they aren't in an actual maze, but getting lost in zombie filled abandoned building, chased through a warren of tunnels and dodging stray lightning bolts in the dark, all call back to the dangers of the maze.THE SCORCH TRIALS could have had some brains to it. At points I get the feeling the writer was trying to tie it all down as an analogy for growing up. If the Maze in the previous film represented a youngster's school life, with its rules, unique culture, sheltered learning environment, and first exposure to girls, then the Scorch almost seemed to represent that youngster taking his first steps into an adult world. It has some nice analogies to what regular teenagers face nowadays. Conflicting loyalties, conflicting emotions, a fling with drugs or just a tempting fling. Some would give up and yearn to return to the sheltered life in school, some would become corrupted by their newfound freedom; some would sink into the same vices that have plagued the adults and yet a few would rise to the occasion, becoming better people in the process. This analogy of the scorch to the trials of young adulthood could have been played up a little better. And it was a real pity too.In the end, THE SCORCH TRIALS cannot be forgiven for its reliance on cliché, even if it was in the original book. I cannot say for certain how much it deviated from the source, but I have learned that the book involved psychic powers. So i guess the lack of psychic powers in the movie is quite an improvement. Other than that, it is yet another movie with lost potential and a sequel that is no where as good as its predecessor.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
77,akshatmahajan,Little let down,6,17 November 2021,"I enjoyed the first part and was excited for the sequel. Now, I haven't read the books but I was expecting new maze games in sequel not some escape adventure type story. It still was entertaining but not fun to watch like the first part. The direction, story and acting was not that strong but I think it's okay for these type of movies to be like this. Overall, you can give it a try.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
78,James_De_Bello,4.5/10,4,23 October 2015,"I am happy to go on record and say that I really liked the first Maze Runner, or at least I really liked it up until its last ten minutes which were a disaster. Nevertheless I admired Wes Ball's direction and even though I wasn't in anyway anticipating this film, I really didn't mind going to see it since I had faith in Ball. Well the result is that I have even more faith in Ball, but story-wise those last ten minutes got extended to a full feature.Is there something that actually makes 100% sense here? I really don't think so. The story is so lackluster and the characters are all over the place. There isn't one event or one action that feels genuine and not artificial. Everything is so coincidental and messy. It is really bothering. This story has no idea what it wants to do or what it is about. The scenes are disjointed and bad editing didn't help this film's case. Moreover the characters simply cannot be figured out, they only speak and act through clichés that aren't even coherent to each one, they are so messy.Fortunately Wes Ball proves he has an amazing visual talent and gets us through this journey almost pleasantly, even though the script is plainly rubbish. In the hands of a lesser director this could have really been a disaster. But the director just has a sharp eye for action and tension and stages one after another, scenes that are interesting to watch, that have gravity to them and build tension. He knows how to combine CGI and practical, even though a slightly higher budget could have helped him a lot. He also knows how to use his actors to his advantage and he makes everything he can out of Dylan O'Brain's charisma and Giancarlo Esposito's charm. Moreover, a very sensible score elevates a lot of what goes on.What we end up with is a really impressive directorial effort that is trying to salvage a lackluster story, with a script that doesn't know its characters and can't make them feel genuine or speak like human beings.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
79,scottshak_111,Surprisingly good!,7,1 October 2015,"When I had watched the first installment and read about how James Dashner had dreamt about The Maze Runner, I could instantly relate to him. It occurred to me how the universe wanted him to mould a situation into a story. He spun a great tale, which promised a franchise then and there. So I went with great expectations to watch this one. The fact that Wes Ball was going to direct this again seemed great too. When the movie gallops into the 'what happens next' territory I was amazed how brilliantly it ran. There wasn't a moment spared for breathing. It just ran and ran, justifying its name. Half way through, and the adventure wasn't stopping. I really liked how the director kept everyone on their feet. I liked how James Dashner had thought this through. How he arranged the bricks to build something beautiful. However, it all seemed pretty predictable. If you take some steps back and really look at it, the story is a classic zombie tale, however doesn't linger in that territory, which is good. There are situations built up deliberately to up the thrill level. Horror has been scooched in the plot to make it look rad. There are a lot of characters in the movie that keep popping up and then are suddenly put down in order to make the flick less lengthy. Then again Wes Ball fails at it terribly. Which takes us to its editing, which isn't that great after the editing. The final bits and the epilogue of the movie are really predictable and reek of mediocrity. You almost see what's coming, and who is going to say what. Given the number of characters the tale keeps on adding Dashner deserves a TV series to do him justice. However, the movie is still good and will make you want to know more just like any other franchise. A definite watch.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
80,DuskShadow,Seems to have gotten away from the formula,4,6 January 2016,"So right off the bat we have the title, which, according to the first film, told you the basic concept of what the franchise was supposed to be about. But unlike the first movie that stuck to its plot device, this film is all over the place. IT was not terrible, but it seemed very disorganized. The first film being a solid 8/10 at least, this film was very disappointing. A male targeted franchise that attempted to focus on the untapped male teen demographic, it feels like a more thrilling version of hunger games. Maze Runners franchise seemed orientated toward a broader range of mid teen to young adult males with its better action, constant use of a certain swear word that means little more than a natural bodily function, and the fact that a male protagonist is always present within most frames. Thats it aside from the various antagonists present in film.Regardless of gender based guesses at which demographic Maze Runner was aimed at , it lost any edge the films could have had since the first. Ditch it if you can and see something else, you wont miss much really the whole genre of youth in the dystopic future was played out ages ago.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
81,fil-nik09,Not bad,7,1 December 2015,"What surprised me the most about the Scorch Trials sequence was that the time watching the movie passed so fast that I was surprised when it ended! Actually I did not expect the ending to be like that - to me, kinda abrupt. But I guess it is a good ending for the next sequel.So, I guess the movie was really entertaining. It was fast paced and interesting. I had to watch / find the ending of the first part to remind myself what was it all about. Although it can be seen - in my opinion - as a stand alone movie - knowing the first part helps you see the story better.For me it was fun fact that there are some actors from the Game of Thrones series.

The Maze Runner has a compact storyline, telling us all we need to know without revealing too many secrets. The Scorch Trials, on the other hand, loses the thread in its script. Piecing the puzzle together's the hardest part, unless the book's been read prior. Sitting back and enjoying the action's the easy part. Thomas (O'Brien) and the Gladers escape the clutches of WICKED, only to find they've walked right back into their hands. The Scorch is the Gladers' new task, set by WICKED leader Janson (Aiden Gillen). At least that happens in the book. In the film, Thomas and company seeks safety, which is inconveniently past the Scorch, in the mountains, unaware that it's a new test. They face new challenges, mainly zombie-like humans, adverse weather conditions, and the enemy constantly on their tail. It hardly feels worth it by end. The Gladers get no where, the trial opening up dilemmas, solving nothing on the way. The action at least keeps us entertained for the majority of the movie. Overall though, a disappointment after a successful start to the trilogy.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
84,kermitkid,Teen friendly Walking Dead,10,30 March 2020,"The first film in the series was exciting, but the plot felt thin. In this one, however, we get all the excitement of the first one, in addition to a great plot. This movie is essentially a zombie movie. It's like a PG-13 ""Walking Dead."" It's actually pretty scary. I read the books, but this movie took the excitement of them and cranked (no pun intended) it up to 1000! Seriously! Don't watch this movie alone. And don't take little kids to it. It's PG-13 for a reason, and even then it is a hard PG-13. It's not inappropriate aside from some profanities, it's just really intense. Even though I read the books and knew for the most part what was coming up, I still jumped a few times! I'm really excited for the next one, and disappointed that I have to wait 2 years for it instead of 1.

After being aggressively annoyed about how bad the first film was, the second actually did the series justice. Besides from being extremely intense, fast paced and enjoyable, the characters were actually better this time around then in the first; The Scorch Trials actually tried and made the characters likable rather than sappy, clichéd teen messes.The Scorch Trials is good, but does suffer from some unnecessary moments that ruin the momentum of the film. Though more well rounded than the first film, it lacks the full drive that you want to see from the film. Fortunately it is saved by decent directing, but you can't help feel that it is time to up the ante and make this film more realistic and adult then this child targeted movement.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

But because I don't know the books, I will give my opinion on the movie alone. It is way more boring than the the first part plus all the action is concentrated in a long run away from the WCKD, which I did not like. The ending of the first one was pretty emotional with the death of Chuck, which felt like the movie succeeded in most of the aspects. But this one did not deliever the same way. The fact that the movie is full of zombies running everywhere like in the most of the cliche zombie films ruined the feeling for me. 6/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
88,pranayjalvi,Less A-maze-ing than the first installment,6,14 November 2015,The maze runner which was released last year was a new concept in YA Movies. This year the second installment in the maze runner series has released & I was expecting the same for this 2nd movie. The most hateful thing in this movie is there's too much running than the previous one. The lead 'Thomas' continues on his journey for finding the truth. There was nothing new in this compared to previous one. The same old running for survival & hope. However the effects were much better that's the reason the budget raised to $60 million compared to $30 million of previous one. The movie would have been much better if it would have a good story. Overall the movie was decent enough to catch my attention especially due to visuals but bit disappointed with the same story. I would go with 3/5 for 'Scorch trials'.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
89,Jerghal,Declining quality,6,22 November 2015,"The first one turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Unfortunately the sequel which directly follows the original (so watch that one first!) is a bit of a letdown.The mysterious ending of The Maze Runner made you curious about what was to follow next, but they do so very little with it. You could sum it up in one line really (spoilers!): The kids are immune to the 'Flare' disease and WICKED (the Umbrella Corp of that world) wants them to experiment on for the cure (and to get a nice profit obviously not because they are philanthropic). All the kids do is run from one place to the next while WICKED is close on their heels. The title suggest there are some sort of 'trials' like the Maze was a trial I guess but in reality there are none. Most characters they meet don't serve much purpose and help little to enrich the story. This makes the fact that the film lasts 132 mins even more ridiculous coz they could have easily cut it down 20mins for a faster pacing.The production values are good, the VFX and digital set extensions look great. You'd think the budget was a lot higher then the 61m$ Fox spent on it (in your face 'Spectre'). The acting is decent (but not great) and I didn't notice the music so it was probably a bit generic I guess.So Fox might have a little problem here: the returns on investment are already declining - though they still made a nice profit (309m$ for 61m$ invested) - and they still have 3 books to turn into a film. I hope the sequels get back on track because if the quality keeps declining at the same pace the audience will give up on this franchise and we'll be stuck with an unfinished saga.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

93,CleveMan66,"""Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials"" feels random and insignificant.",4,19 September 2015,"Have you ever been in a haunted house? If so, you probably walked through a series of dark rooms and narrow passageways, while noticing distinct themes in different areas of the house. A variety of scary creatures jumped out at you or reached for you. The timing of these attacks probably felt as random as the nebulous identities, wardrobe choices and make-up schemes of your attackers. You knew, of course, that none of this was real, but it was just unsettling enough to be fun. Eventually, you got to the end of this bit of entertainment and walked back out into the real world. You likely soon forgot most of the details of that haunted house, mainly because you probably hadn't experienced anything really new, and none of it had a lasting effect on your life. Watching ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" (PG-13, 2:11) is a lot like experiencing that haunted house.This film is the sequel to 2013's ""The Maze Runner"" and is the second adaptation of James Dashner's initial ""Maze Runner"" trilogy (which has since added a prequel and is about to add another). The story is even more divergent (pun intended) from its source material than the previous movie was, this time preserving not much more than the mythology, main characters and the most important of plot points.The action picks up right where it left off at the end of the first film, with Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the remaining Gladers, Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa Agnes (Kaya Scodelario), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores), taken by those who rescued them to a large facility where there's food and fresh clothes. These teens find out that theirs was not the only maze and they become friends with fellow survivor Aris Jones (Jacob Lofland), who suspects that there's more to their new home than meets the eye. The facility's manager, Mr. Janson (Aiden Gillen), assures the Gladers that they're safe now and will soon be taken to a more permanent and more comfortable home. Meanwhile, their freedom is restricted and security is tight. Every day, Janson calls out a list of names and those young people head for their new home. Aris suspects that those who are called never really leave the facility, suffering a fate that is less than comfortable. Soon, Thomas is convinced too.The Gladers, now with Thomas clearly accepted as the group's leader, decide to venture out on their own into what's called ""The Scorch"", a vast wasteland where cities once stood. The earth was decimated by a solar flare and, now, what's left of humanity is struggling to survive and avoid getting a brain-altering disease called the Flare, which turns people into zombie-like creatures who roam freely and prey upon the innocent. (Think ""World War Z"" meets ""Mad Max"".) Thomas and company walk across a vast stretch of desert in search of a rebel group known as the Right Arm and their rumored safe haven in the distant mountains. On the journey, they have to elude Janson and his cohorts who believe that Thomas and his friends hold the key to curing the Flare within their bodies and want to bring them back to his prison-like complex. Along the way, the Gladers meet potential allies like maze survivors Harriet and Sonya (Nathalie Emmanuel and Katherine McNamara), underground community leaders Brenda and Jorge (Rosa Salazar and Giancarlo Esposito), and rebels Mary and Vince (Lili Taylor and Barry Pepper), but also have to contend with disagreements, treachery, injury and death within their own ranks.""The Maze Runner"" got a ""B-"", my barest of recommendations, with a fear that this saga could go off the rails with its next installment. It has. This story has all the narrative cohesiveness of a haunted house and all the significance of a Sunday morning cartoon. Notwithstanding a few nifty action sequences, this film is merely a collection of loosely-related scenes that accomplish little more than keeping the screen bright. Each of the ""Divergent"", ""Hunger Games"" and ""Twilight Saga"" movies stand on their own. ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" fails to do that, or even to prove to be a decent piece of entertainment. ""C-""",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
94,TheOny13,Spends most of its time setting up the conclusion...,1,24 September 2015,"First of all, I didn't want to go and see this movie especially because I saw the first part and while I was watching it I was really interested in knowing why they were tested in the maze or who Thomas and Teresa were, what they did before they were cast out into the maze, etc... but unfortunately I got none of this answers, but what I did get were a lot more mysteries but no answers, but it's not like LOST where it leaves the audience thinking and putting things together and finding out the mysteries, but it's more of a dull and predictable mysteries every time they have some of the main characters talk to each other.This movie starts where the other one picked off, both in action and in mysteries, you will get 0 answers as to how the virus infected the world, or how the world was destroyed as it is, or what is the cure, and mainly you will see that there is no real motivation to be on wither side WICKD or the Gladers, because in fact what separates their motivations is just the way they use the antidote and nothing more, here there's more illogicalness than clever writing or a logical explanation of why Thomas and the others are against WICKD, but yeah the movies spends more of its time giving you more mysteries and making you more interested in seeing the final conclusion than actually put some sense into this chapter... Next, the dialogues are extremely cliché-d like: ""you're not working as fast as I need you"", or ""the boss arriving sooner than expected"", ""come on let's go!"", etc, etc... you get the picture. Although I might be ignored, cause every useful reviews on this are from people who think this movie is awesome, I need to say my opinion and save the money of some people who want to go see this movie hoping it's a good one. More, it seems like every time there is a dialog that can reveal key plot points or mysteries, or memories, is cut short and the subject quickly changes to something else, and it gets really frustrating, I was laughing as hard as I could with my friend in the cinema, while watching things like that or glass that breaks, then suddenly not breaks, then finally breaks, it's like the glass listens to the movie script, just like other things like storm or zombies. This movie got so bad, that at one point where it turned ridiculously cliché-d and mysterious beyond any measure, I thought of leaving the cinema, but I stayed out of respect for my friends who invited me to see it, cause I would NEVER see a movie so cliché-d and stupidly mysterious(I couldn't find any other words) in my life again. This is just an insult to an intelligent mind because this movie just wants to be too clever but ends up setting more mysteries and events for the next movie than it resolves the mysteries or conflicts it already has. Even though there isn't a ""Maze Runner"" title to show at the beginning of the movie, this movies feels ridiculously stupid about running in every scene of the movie. All the conflicts or natural disasters end up with the Young Adults running from those things. And yeah, you heard me correctly, even the natural disasters are chasing the kids. At this point I was having 0 expectations from the movie, and it didn't surprised me after that, being only more cliché-d and predictable, not even zombie's scares didn't frighten me, and honestly I remained with pretty much nothing after this movie, unlike after I watch movies from Stephen Spielberg, Nolan, Scorsese, Ron Howard, etc, etc... So to wrap up this review, don't go and see this movie, unless you are bored to death and want to have some fun and laugh at how bad this movie really is. By the way, the movie's rating is way too high, this shows just how easily people are fooled and how easily their money are wasted on things like this. This movie's real rating should be around 5-6, but until it gets there(which probably won't happen) I stick with 1.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The exposition trip worked well because I was vested in Thomas' journey. For this one I needed some answers and the big picture revealed with clarity. But no. We still get bits and pieces through Thomas and frankly I found it tedious. I can see the bigger budget splashed around but Wes Ball couldn't keep the balancing act. This one is more action than mystery. That is not necessarily bad but after enduring the maze for so long I really needed to know what the heck is the prize.

By looking at the reviews you can clearly see that everyone who has read the books and is a fan of this franchise thinks this movie was absolutely terrible, since i have not read any of the books i found it quite alright.Most importantly it is packed with action, for a kids movie like this it is one of the most detrimental factors, the makers of this are trying to show kids good life lessons and values, like friendship, integrity and bravery, very clearly this film is aimed at more younger audiences, i do not get why people are writing horrible comments about this little action flick, of course it is illogical, of course there is 0 plot and the plot twist is absolutely blatant and visible from miles away. But that is all a part of kids action movies like this, none of the main characters get seriously harmed, if people die, they die without any major bloodshed and there is no profanity, what exactly do you expect from a film like this? It is decent for what it is and its young audience.Overall, not so bad, had beautiful and creative scenery, more action, definitely a very big improvement from the first one, this will be one of those movies kids remember 20 years later and reminisce about the ''good'' movies of their childhood.

98,grandmastersik,Vapid sequel that raises serious questions about the point of the first film,4,18 November 2015,"If you're a teenager looking for some adventure that isn't all ""dark"" and ""gritty"" - the buzz words of films nowadays - then you may enjoy this. If, however, you can't stop asking WHY? constantly, then you'll most likely end up hating it.The Maze Runner wasn't a very good film; in fact, I only watched this because I was in the room with somebody who wanted to see it, so I gave it a chance just to see if an explanation for the first film came about.The surviving teens from the Maze Runner link up with kids from other Mazes, and the first one of them to arrive at the prison-like complex shows Thomas, the film's hero, enough to make him question a conspiracy against the teens... that soon leads to them making an escape.With zombie-like creatures beyond the complex, the teens go from out of the frying pan into the fire, as they discover that they are immune to the virus, which is why the were sent to the mazes in the first place.Okay, so if they're immune, why did one of them get infected? No, that's not a spoiler, it's actually what we all expect to happen given the amount of zombie films we've all seen, but if you can let that go, you can carry on.The teens then reach a settlement and decide that they want to hook up with the resistance, because The Hunger Games are so popular. I mean, there may be another reason, but in an apparently hopeless world, one would imagine that their best bet would be to seek out land to cultivate and become the new leaders of society... after all, isn't that what the Glade was preparing them for? No, it wasn't. In fact, the motives behind the first film are never explained, but instead just become more and more ridiculous as the plot plods along, cliché and cliché. Let's face it: if Wicked already has medicine but requires the immune teenagers to obtain it, why stick them all in Mazes around the world to watch them get killed off? If you can get past that, the end is another big cliché that absolutely no-one will ever see coming (irony), and then Thomas stands up, gives a speech and we can expect the decimated ""resistance"" to rise up against the evil enemy who doesn't seem to use lethal force against them, despite them using real bullets on Wicked's troops, in a third installment.I bet you can't wait for it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The movie had perfect scenes and great character developing and emotional ties. It totally had a spin to it and a ""I didn't see that coming moment"". I could not believe Theresa betrayed everyone and would have never expected that. The thing I hated about the movie was the cliff hanger, and I now have to make assumptions about how good the next movie is going to be. I am very excited for the next movie. Why can't the third movie come on already? I wish I was apart of the movie myself because the film was fantastic. I really appreciated the zombies as well in the movie that was attacking everything they saw insight. Whenever the movie comes out on Netflix I will probably watch it five hundred times in one day.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
100,abouhelier-r,Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,7,7 October 2015,"After having escaped the Maze, the Gladers now face a new set of challenges on the open roads of a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles.What happen when The Maze Runner MUST get a sequel? The answer is lose the maze, keep the running, drop any trace of the social tension, fill the rest with Game of Thrones cast members and add zombies because why not? So this film is the sequel to last year's YA adaptation and pulls the exact same trick. Containing no mazes but plenty of running. The film takes the originals surviving characters and drops them into the middle of an entirely different type of movie, this one a desert- set zombie chase. At least - and contrary to its fellow dystopian teenage sci-fie sagas - this film sustains a bit of curiosity by leaving its characters and its audience completely in the dark about why anything is happening and what any of it could possibly mean. The Scorch Trials offers ultimately no character development whatsoever and only inch of plot advancement. It's mostly just moving a group of motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed. This time the group awakens a swarm of vicious zombies - the film calls them ""Cranks"" - though they're in no way different from any other zombie hordes that you have shuffled across screens over the past decade. However, the action scenes are urgent and masterfully paced. Despite an over reliance on shaky-cam and quick cuts, director Wes Ball stages a number of effective sequences. Particularly a zombie pursuit up through a collapsed skyscraper that relies more on ace production design than CGI to build believability. He also makes time for a few scenes that are so cheekily weird they may as well come from another film. Cinematically, director attempts to sustain engagement by providing each successive setting with a different combination of threats of distinctive stylistic treatment, borrowing from drama, thriller and horror genres. While the technique adds visual diversity. A significant portion of the film is devoted to filling in the narrative gaps essential to maintaining the veil of mystery that characterise The Maze Runner and the Glader's ignorance surrounding their incarceration. Ironically, as more facts emerge, they tend to undermine the storyline rather than reinforce it. When part of a larger narrative the film doesn't make much sense served by an unfocused script. Action is one thing, but the film also needs a better-developed-sense of mystery as well as a deeper exploration of character relationships. The Scorch Trials wanders between YA clichés, there's a resistance, but it's not clear what they're resisting and a zombie movie with the obligatory a-zombie-bit-our-friend scene. Finally, all of that would have been acceptable if the characters were given motivation beyond ""we need to go there"" and ""I need to save her"". Just enough to make you wish they'd just go back into the damn maze already. Overall when the dust settles The Scorch Trials is, as we're repeatedly told of WCKD, ""good"" - just not as god as you want it to be.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
101,stephendaxter,"Bigger, Better, and more action packed",7,24 September 2015,"The Scorch Trials is the sequel to last years pleasant surprise 'The Maze Runner' and the big question was whether the last film was just a fluke or whether there is actually some interesting stories to be told in this world. And i have to say that the first film was not a fluke as this movie lives up to what the first first film set it up to be. There was more action, more thrills, different tones, and it was a more fast paced film than the first. The movie kicks off literally right where the first film cut to black so it felt good to just get on with the story as oppose to stopping to catch us up on what has happened since the last one ended. Unfortunately though, you don't really learn a whole lot more about the overarching story in this film, whatever questions you had after the first film don't really get answered, they only give you a whole lot more questions to think about while you wait for the final instalment. The elements of mystery are still there, although they aren't the main driver of the film like in the first, they are pushed aside for a more action packed sequel which really worked.The fast paced action sequences were in full force for this entire film, the film kept on moving from place to place offering a range of different exciting and fun action scenes where you always felt that the stakes were high. There were some intense gun battles that were chaotic and then you have some different action scenes that were a lot darker than the rest of the film. They were very horror like themes that got pretty freaky at times and i was pleasantly surprised by how dark it got more than once. This variety is what kept me engaged in the film. The film does slow down on occasion to introduce some new characters, sorry, i mean a lot of new characters. Every 20-30 minutes you hear of this new objective that ultimately leads to more and more new characters, i understand that they are trying to build this world but they crammed so much into this film. Driving this film were the characters, some of which you can remember from the last film and the actors again put in strong convincing performances. Even many of the new supporting cast were interesting and you really get to know them and get behind them, or really really hate them. Giancarlo Esposito and Aidan Gillen were great additions to the film and brought in some very interesting characters that play big parts in the film. One other minor thing i have to mention is the inability for the film-makers to end a Maze Runner movie well. Like the first film this one felt like it was going to end like 3-4 times before it actually decided to end and even when it did end it was very abrupt. Some people may like this but it makes the films feel like one long continuous story that has been broken up into three parts and released separately, i would rather three individual stories that all link but that's just me, not really an issue. In the end, this was a well made sequel that proved this series isn't just a crappy version of The Hunger Games. It was more fast paced and action packed and offered a lot more variety of different themes than the first film and may just sneak past it in terms of which is better. - 7.4",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
102,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials,7,6 February 2016,"I don't know if it's just here in Australia but I feel that this movie has gone under the radar. Trailers only started airing about a week before the movie was released but other than that, no other press or advertising like that seemed to be released.Like the first movie, I really enjoyed this film.It picks up straight from the ending of the first film; complete with a cast that doesn't look they have aged since filming The Maze Runner.All the sets and the scenic views are awesome, it looks futuristic without throwing it in our faces as is the apocalyptic look of the film.Dylan O'Brien is still the stand out of this film and if even possible, is even better than he was in the previous film and handles leading the film and all the action and drama really well.Aside from O'Brien, the cast is pretty awesome including both previous stars (Ki Hong Lee, Dexter Darden, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Alexander Flores) and new additions (Lili Taylor, Barry Pepper, Giancarlo Esposito, Jacob Lofland and Rosa Salazar).I still don't feel any chemistry between Thomas (O'Brien) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario); I felt more chemistry between Thomas and Brenda (Salazar) and I'm hopefully optimistic that Thomas and Teresa won't end up together in the end.Aside from WCKD, we get a looks at some new baddies working against them including zombies and even for a chunk of the film, the weather.Given some of the things that happen towards the end, I am now eagerly awaiting the third film. Just a whole two years to go!Will be going to see it again and will be a Day 1 purchase when it's released to own.CHAPPY THINKS that he doesn't want to wait until 2017 until the third movie comes out!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Luckily there are some new interesting characters introduced that last pretty far into the movie. We also get introduced to the disease that plagues the planet in more detail. Everything I'm saying is pretty much just what the movie it, the only way to describe how good it is is to say it is just a continuation of a series of young adult films based off a series of young adult novels. The one thing I must point out is that there is a single scene (when music plays and things explode) that is done very well and provides epic visuals.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
105,palavitsinis,Nice movie on so many levels!,8,22 October 2015,"To begin with, I have to let you know that I was not aware of the existence of any book before I saw the first and second movie. So, comments like ""you ruined the book"", etc. don't make sense to me. I saw the first movie on a DVD and this one in the movie theater. For me it was pure entertainment for the entire duration of the movie! I liked the thrilling scenes and the chase from the zombie like people. At some points I could not help but thinking that it a PS4 game and at some point they would turn over the control of the actors to me and I would be left alone clicking on X or L1/R1 to run as fast as I can! I liked that but many may not like it. For me this was awesome!The acting was OK, as expected and really similar to the first one. It's not like you wait to see an Oscar-winning performance there, right? I really enjoyed all the special effects and the amazing scenes from the cities that are crumbling and falling apart. The movie seemed a lot longer than it is. The action-packed and full story behind it, gave too much information and left me feeling really ""full"" after watching it and this was not because of the XXL pop corn that I ate! I will go to the movies to see the third one, with excitement! And yes, it definitely is an ""8"" in its genre. ""7"" felt like a minimum, so I would easily give a ""7.5"" with pleasure! If you don't like this kind of post-apocaliptic stories, wait till it's out in DVD, don't spend money in the movies.

The story was ok, acting was fine, but I just couldn't get past 'Thomas' acting the hero at every turn. It appeared the film makers wanted this guy to be the only one to notice any danger or offer encouragement, as a result he grated very quickly.
His dialogue was frustratingly annoying, consisting mainly of "" go, go go"", "" keep going, keep going"", ""get inside, get inside"", ""Don't move, don't move"" and the all too frequent ""No, no, no, no"". Within half an hour I was hoping he'd be killed off quickly, but knew, sadly that he'd be the one to pull the gang together and see them through it all.I haven't seen the first instalment and judging on this one, i won't be.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I think that out of all of the movies based on a young adult novel that has came out, The Maze Runner 2: Scorch Trials is one of my favorites.Script and direction: I thought that this movie was very well-written and very awesomely executed. Wes Ball once again took on this task of make a really great sequel to the original. The first film I liked it, but there were problems that I had to which even one can't defend, but this film, not perfect, but it is a lot of fun.Action: I thought the action was very well-handled and trust me, there is a lot of action in this film.

The film is 2 hours and 11 minutes long but I enjoy it. The score by John Paesano once again is freaking epic and amazingly well-done.Acting: The acting in this film is really well-acted. Dylan O'Brien as Thomas was good in the first film and he is even better in this film. Kaya Scodelario as Teresa did a great job too, but I don't like what happens to her. There is a moment where they kiss in the film and I'll talk more about in detail soon, but I think she did a fantastic job. Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt was awesome and Rosa Salazar is very amazing as Brenda. I have to give credit to the casting directors they did a great job.Overall: This was a really good movie. Again, I will say the movie is not perfect, but I don't think it deserves some of the bullcrap and slack that people has given this film. I think it's an awesome film with a lot of great ideas in it. It's not horrible either, but the ending makes me go like, ""Yes! I so can't freaking wait for the next Maze Runner movie!"", which comes out in 2017 and is titled The Death Cure.Hopefully, this series will end on a high note in 2017 when the third film is released but for now, my rating is a 10 out of 10 stars!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

109,tinovalkki,Way better than first one,7,3 October 2015,"Although The Scorch Trials is clearly midmost move of a trilogy it endorse way better than the first Maze Runner movie. The first movie worked only through the half way of the movie, but Scorch Trials keep you awake thru hole movie. Not even the end of the movie fails you. It just keep you to stay interest up what is going to happen in third movie. Biggest problem is that the movie serves on bits from the background story. Sometimes the whole story seems not to have any clear target and teenagers just feels to wonder around without any clear destination. That bites a little of movies credibility. Despite that The Scorch Trials is way more solid movie than the first one. Alien robots has now replaced with zombies. You only feel need more to know more about what has happened in past and how humans become to zombies, but story won't tell you that. I haven't read the book trilogy and I don't know if the third story opens that more. Certainly you do want to know some more and that could make it more interesting.3D seems to be needless in movie. There is only one scene that works well in 3D. Most of the movie just feels that there is no 3D involved. Scene inside of falling skyscraper looks great and works well with 3D. Rest of the movie doesn't. If director can't abuse to use 3D it seems to be pointless to use. Especially most of the movie happens at night and dark places. Usage of 3D makes it even more darker and makes it harder to follow the story.After all The Scorch Trials is quite eligible dystopia. It keeps enough your interest to wait what is going to come. It isn't any biggest movie in the history, but fair popcorn movie anyway.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
110,Sci-FiHorrorFan,Not Bad Or Great Just Okay.,6,25 October 2015,"This is an honest Review and if people don't like Honest Opinions then Don't Read It. I will Mention the Films Bad points First then it's Good Points. I will not be surprised if people Thumb my Review Down either.Overall I Liked this film but it does have its problems.The Main problem for me is That it was Very Predictable. There were moments when the characters did stupid things and I saw it coming I also knew exactly who the bad guys were from the beginning and that's mainly because it's so obvious yet for some Reason the characters can't figure it out themselves despite the Fact that they are being Used by them. Another problem is the bad guys themselves. I thought the Bad Guys were very Lame.they were never scary or threatening or Tough. There were times when I thought Thomas was Tougher than the bad guys were! And he's the good guy!.The bad guys should have been Strong not Lame Asses. There was a laughable scene in the film when the female villain yells Orders at the man who is supposed to be the (Main Bad Guy) and he just stands there and does Nothing!.He just let's her Order him around!.This Man should not be the Main bad guy if he's just going to get yelled at.He's not a Strong or scary bad guy and he doesn't do much except yell orders at his Soldiers. His Soldiers were Tougher than he was and they also do more than he does. I personally found the bad guys weird and their Motivation was unclear and when it's explained Later in the film the female Villain gives a Lame Reason which did not excuse her Actions at all.Another problem for ME personally are the characters.I didn't care much about many of the characters. I only liked two characters,I liked Thomas and I liked the Jorge Character I thought he was pretty cool and he was also strong and likable. I also didn't mind a couple of the Main guys friends but in all honesty Thomas and Jorge were the best and most interesting characters there.The others were kind of in the back ground. I must also admit there were a few times were Dylan O Brian's performance fell a little Flat,but for the most part he was Okay and I liked his characters courage and determination to escape. That's exactly what I liked about his character in the first film,he was also a brave character and he cared about his friends which is why I Liked him.Something small that bugged me were the creatures,they were like Zombies I don't remember the names of the creatures but I will just call them zombies because that's what they looked like and how they acted. The Zombies felt out of place in this film,This is a series called the Maze Runner but it felt more like the Zombie Runner. There were also times when the movie seemed a bit shallow and during its middle half it wanders around too much.NOW getting to the Things I liked about the film.one of them is the Cinematography. I thought the film was Shot Very well and its also a very good looking film. The film also has good special effects and They used their budget well. The outside scenery is nice to look at and the Location they used was interesting. The Directing was Okay and the story was Okay. The script needed a bit of work because Some of the Dialogue was a bit Lame for example there is a lot of No Sh*t Sherlock dialogue. A lot of things that are obvious are mentioned like for example we Have to Escape!. Another one of them was we are no Safer out here than we are in There. (Gee I didn't know that). I sat there thinking your telling us stuff we Already KNOW. There was also a lot of exposition dialogue which I don't think was needed because not every single thing needs to be explained. In some films exposition is needed but this was not one of them. Sometimes it's best if you let the viewer figure things out for themselves Rather than explaining every little thing.OBVIOUS Things I should mention. But that was just something that bugged me personally and I'm sure no one else will care about that.Getting back to things I did like probably the thing I liked the Most was the Action. The Action was good and I enjoyed all the Action scenes even the Zombie scenes. Despite the zombies feeling out of place I still enjoyed The Action scenes with them because they were Exciting. That's one of the things that made this film a Fun Ride there were a lot of adrenaline pumping Action scenes and chase scenes and Those were Very Fun to watch. The music was also very good especially the Music After the Credits.I thought the Film had a Fairly good start when the kids are put into the Facility and when they figure out what's going on and try to escape the Facility I found that quite Entertaining too,but after that the Film mainly takes place outside in the Scorch were they have to fight Zombies and Crazy people as well as get through Sand Storms which I found Entertaining. There was a Fun shootout Near the End of the Film which I also enjoyed and it was Fun Watching this group of Friends Fight together as a Team, I Liked that. I was not too struck on the Ending of the Film though, as it left a Lot to be desired because they set it up for a sequel. Overall the Film has Fun Action scenes and its pretty entertaining despite its problems so I would recommend At least One Watch For The Fun Action.Right Let the Thumbs Down Commence!.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

112,barbagvido,"Good on it's own, but terrible as an adaptation",8,20 September 2015,"Alright, I'm a huge fan of the books and I adore every book in the trilogy. It's probably my favorite YA series alongside Harry Potter. When I saw the first movie last year, I liked it but wasn't impressed but when I saw it for the second time, I loved it so I was very excited about this one. The first one had quite a lot changes from the book but it was nothing compared to this. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, but one of the most unfaithful adaptations ever. Visually, it was great and action scenes were really intense. The acting was fine, but nothing outstanding. Zombies, actually Cranks, are really creepy and if you're a kid or a parent that is planning to go watch this with a kid, don't. It's way to scary for children. There will be spoilers in this paragraph, so SPOILER ALERT. The movie starts in a typical YA sequel cliché. The main character's nightmare or trauma and after that it throws us straight into action and it gets you really pumped up. It was clear to see from the trailers that movie will be unfaithful to the source material, but it was unfaithful way too much. You know how when you watch a movie after reading a book and then think or talk about what they changed? Here you think about what they kept. I'll tell you what they kept:the title, the characters, the setting, Cranks, Winston's death (the way it happened was different), Group B, that party scene when Thomas and Brenda are drunk and kiss, Teresa's betrayal (it also played in a much more different way than in the book) and the rest is like watching a fanfic movie. Oh yeah, and some stuff from The Death Cure, the third book like the Right Arm (with different members) and escape from WCKD. SPOILER END If you're a non-reader you will really like the movie (probably) and find it very intense and entertaining. If you're a book reader however you will probably be disappointed. I know the movie can never be same as the book and I like that, but I don't want it to be THIS different.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
113,djangozelf-12351,Better than the first but that's not saying much.,7,3 November 2015,"First of,I don't like these sort of movies and that has partially to do with the fact that there is to much of 'm.Hunger games and Divergent all stick to the same elements just like maze runner and to much of the same subjects which gets confusing if you watching multiple of these movies in a small period of time.I liked the first maze runner because it varied the most from the other 2 but I still felt it was far from flawless but it had potential and therefor I would rate it 6 stars.Problem here is the evasiveness of the story similar or even worse than in the first one.The difference is ,the pacing of the action is good and I found that to be a real step up compared to the first which is even logical because it need to build up the story.The end didn't bother me to much because I sorta anticipated that it would come at an awkward moment as it did.The last(2?)will be the pay off and only than I can decide if it was worth all the mystery.I did not read the books but I came to understand a lot of it changes in the movies and it got me some what concerned how they gonna end this.After the second hunger games I was done with that.divergent looked to much like hunger games but than with rules that were even more cuckoo so,no.I'll stick with this one and hope I made the right choice.Last honest remark,this is nice popcorn entertainment but for me this is not the sort of storytelling that spells out ""classic"". Way to many inconsistencies and plot devices stretched out in multiple books while one book would have sufficed.A word just came to mind...one trick pony.But...a bestselling trick so,maybe...it's just me being wacky.Sorry!I liked it,go see it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Far from it in fact as I find most of it boring. To be precise, what I love is thrilling action that involves chasing, running, those split second action scenes that take your breath away. This film is full of those and this is exactly what made for an intense, thrilling and exciting 3D cinema experience, jaw-dropping and breath-taking to be even more precise. I enjoyed every minute of it and this has to be amongst my top five cinema experiences.Regardless of what the reviews would have said, I would still have watched the film purely because I have been into this series, so that had no influence. Still what I read mostly was that the action is great and thrilling but the plot is weak. The positive half it is of the reviews that made me quite eager to watch it as soon as I could. So I would say it was worth it. The best scene has to be of course was the one where Thomas slips through from under the gate. My heart skipped a beat in that one, phew!Sadly though, the film misses out on two stars for the weak, full of holes plot and for leaving so many questions unanswered.

Unfortunately there are just too many repetitive scenes towards the middle of the film, and it slows the pacing down a whole lot. What saves this from a negative score in my opinion, however, are the visuals, which are surprisingly great and increase the grandeur of the film. There are some great supporting performances from Alan Tudyk, Giancarlo Esposito and Patricia Clarkson, who are clearly all having fun in their roles, and overall, despite the story not being the best, I did enjoy this, and if you liked the original then you'll probably like this one too.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I rarely bother to praise - it's so much more fun criticising.re. my title - I was so glad to see this was rated as low 6's. Personally, I think a '4' is about right.So what was this 'film' all about? In fact, it's not so much a film as a TV series glued together and marketed as a film. The actors are the same second rate people you get in a lot of the ""sci-fi"" TV series... people like Giancarlo Esposito from ""Revolution"".The plot was so full of holes and stupid camera tricks it became annoying. For example, the group is in a pickup that gets held up at a road block. They all get out and are shot at, so they take cover alongside the various vehicles. And then -MAGIC- there are three people with rifles just two feet away from them! Did they beam down from the enterprise? I wonder if ""The Walking Dead"" crew were involved in this film?

119,valen060,"Not Quite Better Than Its Thrilling Predecessor, But Still A Gripping Chase with A Great Cast Performance",8,21 September 2015,"Looking back at 2014's surprise hit The Maze Runner, its sequel The Scorch Trials was something that proved to be an immediate worthy follow-up. The moment I stepped into the theater, I had some thoughts of what was to happen following from escaping the ever-changing, intricate maze and dodging the Grievers that inhabit it. Sadly for Thomas and his fellow Gladers, their efforts in leaving the maze behind were just the beginning when they are finally brought out into the open, revealing a ravaged wasteland that was once hospitable. While evading Cranks (zombie-like creatures affected by the outside world's solar flares), they must venture out to this metaphorically wider maze to find any other rebels out there fighting for the same cause to put an end to W.C.K.D.'s nefarious plans.With this game of ""cat-and-mouse"" being played nearly throughout this interesting sequel, it started to remind me of (most notably) George Orwell's novel 1984 and the 2008 techno-thriller movie, Eagle Eye. Because like the latter, The Scorch Trials had this whole theme of paranoia, deception, and loyalties being tested mixed together. Whereas the main characters go through any means necessary to evade their pursuer, but strike back when given the right chance. Actor Dylan O'Brien is certainly no Shia LaBeouf, but his character Thomas is quick to act when he and his group's lives are on the line. Which I must say kind of suits the scenarios the Gladers must face when trying to elude the evil organization looking for them. With the return of Thomas Sangster's Newt, Ki Hong Lee's Minho, and Kaya Scodelario's Teresa, they all proved their part as individuals who can hold their own among the Gladers. It gives off this cohesive element of a nonconformist persona among them. Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad, Revolution) as rebel leader Jorgè was certainly a change of pace compared to his TV characters he's known well for, but his inclusion into this film series proved to be notable for his style of acting, especially since he's no stranger to post-apocalyptic scenarios.As a whole of over two hours ten minutes running time, the cast delivered great performances and the action sequences were such a nail-biter that you'll miss the best part if you turn your attention away for only a moment. Story and concept-wise, it felt like a watered-down, bloodless version of a Resident Evil movie for the young adult genre, which I think a junior high student could easily think up. Nevertheless, all my attention and adrenaline was geared towards the most complex action scenes that proved to be no easy feat as the characters continue to run near endlessly to formulate a plan. I can tell that some of them needed great practice to have it play out well on screen. In the pool of YA book-turned-film adaptations, I'd say this title is really trying to rise up to prove its worth as the other big name YA films that already came before it. Despite not having any directorial involvement in any other titles prior to this film series, director Wes Ball is starting to demonstrate that he can helm a movie on this second round of maze running. With a third movie still yet to be released, only time will tell how this conflict will turn out in the end.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

121,kdavies-69347,A terrible rip off of much better films.,3,4 December 2015,"Sigh... Yet another entry in the ""Teen drama in a Dystopian Future"" genre, following the lines of The Hunger Games and other much better films.The biggest problem I have with this film, isn't it's poor acting, or terrible plot, or disjointed story line, or the lack of back story, or the fact that a group of 10 kids RUN through a desert without drinking a drop of water throughout the film (in about 15 minutes I might add). The fact is, every act of this film is a rip off of much better movies.The first act doesn't cover much in terms of a re-cap so yeah, you'll need to watch the first film to understand why it's called Maze Runner. There is no maze in this film.Society is destroyed leaving ruined cites and a desert landscape around the globe. (Mad max) An evil corporate network controls the remaining resources in search of a cure for a virus turning people into zombie like creatures. (Resident Evil) A group of kids escape their totalitarian like bondage and rise against the machine of the evil network WICKED. Then they join a paramilitary group of guerrilla fighters. (Divergent) ""The Flair"" has infected the planet except for a few surviving groups of people, and when you are bitten you become one of them. (The walking dead, dawn of the dead, 28 days later... my god I'm over the whole zombie thing already). Mad max, Resident Evil, Divergent, Dawn of the Dead, 1984, Lord of the Flies... it's like the film couldn't decide which movie or book to rip off for it's plot line.If it wasn't enough, the film is so inconsistent with it's plot, that you're never really sure of what the hell is going on. One minute their in a government base, next they're running through a desert, next their in a... nightclub for LSD kiddies... then the Rocky Mountains. I felt like the whole thing was a garbled mess. And by the end I was left asking myself, ""What was the point?"" I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a low IQ or don't like movies with better stories. This movie was definitely a trial to get through.3/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
122,georgecoffeynewyorker,Great action; plot could be a bit more constructive thou.,7,19 September 2015,"Well what an amazing film, this was. Although plot wise it wasn't as constructed as the first film. THe Maze Runner(Review here). Great acting now doubt. Thomas(O' Brien) as ever so cute and adorable that he is, is always the odd ball out. hhaahahWhen in darkness, my heart was beating like mad. I was able to see if a character would jump out at the screen a few time. But one character of which was infected with the ""Flare"" virus scared the shite outta me. hahaah.PLOTThe plot as I said above wasn't as constructed as the first one. In the first one they were mainly in one area ie the Maze. However this time, the amigos: Newt(Brodie-Sangster); Winston(Flores); Teresa(Scodelario); Minho(Lee); newly joined to the amigos Aris(Lofland) and Frypan(Darden) all escape the WICKED(World In Catastrophe: Killzone Experiment Department). In the opening scenes, we see a Young Thomas(Gallegos) being given up by his mother(Martinez-Cunningham) to WICKED. Fast forward to the present times, Thomas as ever continues to cause havoc by wondering whats going on etc., Janson(Gillen) is head of Operations at this facility. So the gang with ARis' help escape the facility. Of which I was quite surprise considering if you're NOT in the Facility that you will not survive out in the open with all the zombies or the ""Flare"" affected beings. However I was wrong, as Thomas proved otherwise. They encounter Brenda(Salazar) and Jorge(Esposito) in their travels. They then continue their journey. However sadly one of my precious Winston is affected by an affected being ie the ""Flare"" virus. They want to get to beyond the Mountain. THey arrive some how survivingly. Teresa while at the Mountain calls upon the WICKED by stating ""I'm sorry, I had no choice"", something like that. An epic battle ensues. The Powerful Ava Paige(Clarkson) appears and what a statement that really went through me: ""Whatever it takes"", she goes to test for immunisation etc., etc., So Thomas takes his power when Minho is taken back to WICKED, ""I am going to kill Ava Paige"".

My oh my did this film not only destroy my hopes of that but it frustrated and annoyed me to the point of pure rage. Horrifically predictable, Annoyingly bad action sequences, inconsistencies galore, awful dialogue and a token black guy who I still don't know who the hell he is or even care. Scenes were laid out in the most unimaginative unoriginal way possible and the fact they try and force feed you emotions where none exist is just pure stupidity and bad writing. The film drags on and before you even reach the half way point you feel like throwing in the towel completely. Hands down the most unoriginal piece of dog poo I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. The end was nothing more than an awful setup to 1-2 more films which enraged me even more.

Countless scenes of running from zombie hoards, meaningless sacrifice and betrayal sound good, but it's boring after awhile. To make matters worse the violence is so strong its hard to believe this movie didn't get an R rating. It just seemed there were two writers, one trying to adapt the novel and the second writing the next Zombie Apocalypse movie.

125,keithlovesmovies,Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials Review,5,23 September 2015,"Now in a remote fortified outpost, Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Frypan (Dexter Darden) and Winston (Alexander Flores) find themselves in further danger when they uncover another plot by the mysterious organization WCKD. Now with the help of a new ally Aris (Jacob Lofland), the Gladers must stage an escape into the Scorch, a barren landscape filled with obstacles and swarming with virus-infected people called Cranks. Their only hope is to find a group known as the Right Hand, a group of fighters who can help them in their battle against WCKD.If you came here looking for some semblance of a story, then you're in the wrong place. I will say that I have not read the series of books in which this film is based but I have seen the first film and I enjoyed it. To me, this film has forgotten all that made the first film good, the camaraderie, figuring out the maze, and uncovering the mystery of why they were there. Albeit they are no longer in a maze but I thought this film had none of the other things. Camaraderie takes a backseat here as Thomas's friends are relegated to the background and the story is often silly and full of plot holes. Being where they are in the story and where this film fits in the series, they tried to expand the film's world and tried to dazzle us with more action sequences and special effects but I felt that the story got lost in the shuffle. This film is also a little different tone-wise when compared to the first film but I didn't mind that as much. I just think that it tried to be many things but did not do any very well. It's sometimes an adventure film, an action film, a drama, and a science fiction film. To me I felt like I was watching teenagers running away from things for 2 hours. I lost count how many times I've heard characters utter such phrases as ""Come On"" and ""Let's Go"". This is type of environment unfortunately leaves little room for simple plot development making the camaraderie from the first film irrelevant as little time was used for characters to have conversations with one another in order to further develop some more camaraderie amongst each other. The story, more so than the first film, did feel cliché at times, making it predictable. At others, I found myself getting frustrated with certain characters going back to the plot holes and questioning their motives. It's unfair but also fair but being the second film of the series, it will always be compared to the first but it's still the second film so it has to try to continue with what the first film started. I don't think it did. I came in with high expectations after the first film but I ended up leaving slightly disappointed. Dylan O'Brien's Thomas at least made it watchable for me.Score: 5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
126,baehr_adam,A worthy sequel to a phenomenal book franchise.,10,20 September 2015,"I will start by saying that I have read the book Trilogy. I haven't read the prequel though yet and I have read the 1st 2 books Twice. I will now continue with my review for this movie after establishing that I'm an avid fan of the books. I only did this bc a lot of reviews I see got mad at the movie for certain outcomes that happened in the book. I will say that I personally loved the movie. I found it to be a worthy successor to the 1st film which I have seen 3 times. The story while different from the 2nd book in many facets also plays nicely with the 1st movie. The acting is Amazing and my favorite character in the book Jorge played by Giancarlo Esposito was Fantastic. The action was extremely well done and very riveting. The enemies which everyone should know by now if you have read the books or seen the trailers are a mix between ""28 Days Later"" & ""World War Z"". I will move onto my 2nd opinion of the story which when comparing it to the book is very different and there are certain scenes from the book that I wish they had included in the film but it is what it is regardless from that it moved along just fine. I would recommend this movie for sure if you're a fan of the books or even the movie. I also would recommend not paying attention to reviews from people who haven't read the book as they don't have the whole picture.

128,russellingreviews,Running aimlessly to nowhere,4,9 September 2015,"""You can't survive the scorch."" Walking into the cinema... Are dystopian young adult dramas running out of steam?Overall rating: 2 stars Cinematic value: 2 stars Big questions value: 2 starsFor those keeping up with the latest in young adult dystopian fiction, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials continues the saga of Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and his fellow Gladers. They have escaped the Maze, but it is an 'out of the frying pan and into the Scorch' experience. They leave their dystopian Garden of Eden existence and find themselves at a transfer depot facility that is overseen by Jansen (Aiden Gilen). He claims to be helping the 'immunes' of society to get to a safe place that is far from the barren wasteland called The Scorch. Thomas' band of brothers and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) have to determine if the outpost is designed to set them free or to keep them captive. On top of these internal trials, after their recent maze exodus they also need to investigate the purpose of the mysterious organisation called WCKD and how Janson's outfit is involved. Their haphazard search for the truth involves a multitude of other human outposts where they run into the hands of organised crime gangs, infected zombie-like creatures and The Right Arm resistance fighters, all in an attempt to stay ahead of WCKD's special forces.Director Wes Ball (The Maze Runner) managed to deliver a fresh spin on the disquieting young-adult genre with his first instalment and developed an intriguing cinematic puzzle. Unfortunately, this relatively new director has fallen into the trap of the sophomore venture. Given the task of following up to his original creation, he has to try and make lightning strike twice. In this second outing, he struggles to determine what type of film he is trying to make. Is it The Hunger Games, is it World War Z, or is it Alien? Understandably, sampling from other filmmakers is not new for directors, but Ball seems to be get lost within the tangled web he attempts to spin. Early in the film Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) asks Thomas if he has a plan for their escape and the leader has no solid answer. The same can be said of Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, there does not seem to be any concrete direction for the story. From the first chapter to the second, the producers invested in a multitude of special effects, but seemed to have left the script writer back in the maze of the first episode. The script becomes a series of derivative lines that only serve as trivial connectors between the numerous running sequences. One appealing factor of The Maze Runner was the development of the key characters, which helped the audience to develop concern for their well being. In this venture, most of the misguided disciples of Thomas serve one of two purposes, either as hopeless running companions or the victims of the various horrors along the way. There is a richness to the visual effects journey, but the The Scorch Trials lacks much character development. Understandably with trilogies, the second link in the chain is meant to connect the series together, leaving key plot points open for the conclusion to answer, but it helps if the audience cares about the central players. The challenge in getting people to the final instalment of this trilogy will be to provide a reason for caring for this group of misfits, because the second chapter does not provide this key story element. Leaving open the question, should we care if the society of Maze Runner even survives? Taking a moment to catch a breath from all of the athletic activity, this film does have one underlying theme that is worth pondering. Thomas and the others must risk their own lives to save the remnant of society. Yet, with their best intentions, they are caught in the cross-fire of forces that seem to be attempting the same goal, saving the lives of the world's population. In trying to save the earth, is the fate of society worth the sacrifice of a a few? Throughout the film, the lines are blurred in answering the question of the sanctity of life. It is not an easy answer, but does beg the questions the value of life and to what lengths must we go to preserve others lives? God proves throughout the Bible the lengths he will go to to save people's lives, but people need to determine if they are willing to accept his answer to life. Leaving the cinema... One puzzling factor in the majority of the end of the world and dystopian style films in the past few years is they all happen in San Francisco. It is an exceptionally iconic city that is known for the engineering marvel, the Golden Gate Bridge. Yet, as a bridging film, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is far from iconic and definitely is not a cinematic marvel. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. How will the world come to an end? (Matthew, 24:36, Revelation 20:1-15) 2. What does the Bible say about the sanctity of life? (Genesis 1:27, Psalm 139: 13-16, Matthew 5:21-22) 3.

The Scorch Trials follows Thomas and co. after they have exited the Glade and eventually find themselves in an even more hostile environment, the Scorch. If the environment doesn't kill them, the Cranks will, zombie-like people who have contracted an apocalyptic virus. This movie deviates significantly from its predecessor; while The Maze Runner was an intense sci-fi mystery, The Scorch Trials is an action-packed thriller bent on making your pulse race from start to finish. It lacks the mystery of the first film, but the sequel makes up for it with the unpredictable and thrilling plot and visceral action scenes. It also packs a strong emotional punch. All the returning characters have been nicely developed while new characters bring exciting changes to series' pace and style, so when the final act goes completely insane, you'll really feel for what these characters go through.

132,prospectus_capricornium,Less A-Maze-ing than the First Installment,6,9 September 2015,"Last year's 'The Maze Runner' was en route to a non-conformist course off the young adult/post-apocalyptic sub-genre, delivering less familiar but appealing deviations from the more recognizable standards of the category. This year, 'The Scorch Trials', its sequel, keeps some of the original beats of its predecessor, but it eventually falls into the scope of the overly familiar trope that the first film has defiantly avoided, which is a bit disappointing, considering the riveting buildup they've pulled off with the first film.      Much of this film is spent in running. That doesn't necessarily makes the film bereft of sense and extremely difficult to follow, but that fact itself, hinders the proceedings from delivering a comprehensible narrative. 'The Gladers', still led by Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), are now on the run from the forces of WCKD, the mysterious organization that placed them in the Glade. What even worse, are Cranks, James Dashner's version of zombies, joining the pursuit. After seemingly endless cat and mouse chases, you'd be thankful to see them stumble upon a resistance movement, giving them a few moments to rest (that gives you a moment to rest from following them). But that's just a bump, because as soon as alliances are formed and a hint of the government's agenda, is revealed, it's marathon-time again.     See, that's what sends this sequel spiraling down from the heights the first film has soared past in 2014. It lacks genuine emotions, and there are barely plot developments well- knitted enough to spark interest. The marathon extravaganza hampers the characters to fully connect with each other, and engage in a conversation, lengthy enough to help us understand. That's maybe the problem for someone who hasn't read the book like me, ever loaded with 'how's and 'why's, which this sequel seems uninterested in answering, until the final chapter.That being said, there are still some few things to commend, like the fact it has retained, if not improved, its scares and thrills. The Grievers are now replaced by hungrier and grotesquely more vicious Cranks, and the obstacles are updated, to provide more hair raising creeps. The first movie's $340million worldwide cume against its $34million budget has given this sequel a bigger financial resource for production, and you would thank that for 'The Scorch Trials' stunningly choreographed setpieces, looming up in and between adrenaline- propelled pursuits. Some new characters, like Aiden Gillen's Rat-Man, are introduced, but the rest or more than half of movie's payroll's new names, are barely, if not efficiently, utilized. That's an inevitable additional layer to the heap of flaws that piled up for this outing, but it's extremely hard to completely shrug off the film, especially with an interesting, and riproaring climax, that pretty sets the stage for the trilogy's final phase. While that last chapter is yet to happen, let's pray for the last film to never get split into two. 6/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
133,kuuk3,"Superb sets, great action if not a bit too long.",8,13 September 2015,"This film has everything from sandstorms and lightning to Zombies and evil henchman. Its as though the writer / director said lets throw everything into the story that we can and see what sticks, and then when it came time to edit some of it out, everything cost so much to make that they didn't want to remove it.This means the film has a running time in excess of two hours and its a lot to digest. There is so much action that we as a viewer get exhausted watching it. The gang of kids we never really get to meet. Only Tom has a purpose, the others I couldn't even tell you their names. I guess they could have been left out the script as none of them were useful. One of them started complaining at the start, suggesting a possible conflict but them he just shut up for the rest of the film.Then there are all the new cast members who become redundant mere minutes after being introduced. Eventually you start to wonder if some of these people could have been left out the movie to make a much tighter edit. The sets are however outstanding. The scorched Earth is something I want to see again. You do start wondering though - if all these giant mazes are apparently around the place, with green pastures inside. Why would anyone live in the desert when they can live quite happily inside the maze? The action is great, most scenes make sense (although there is one jump cut from we have to take cover from the storm to the next morning). There are times when you have to ignore logic like needing food and water, leaving guns behind and stuff like that. But this was an enjoyable film which is very fast paced, if perhaps a little too much of a good thing but still a great film that you need to see on the big screen.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The plot is moronic and entirely based on setting the viewer up for the next imbecilic movie. The lead character is an idiot of epic proportions who simply bungles his way from one self- made catastrophe to another with the awareness of a drugged donkey in a sack. After getting the majority of those he meets killed due to his actions, the only hope I had of seeing an end to my suffering was when he threatened to blow himself and everyone else up. Unfortunately this attempt at ending the franchise was thwarted, meaning another movie is in the pipeline no doubt. By the end of the film I just wanted everybody in it to die and give another species the opportunity to evolve past the two dimensional characters and shitty plot. Then Thomas promises to go back and rescue his friend and put everything right after having just spent two movies trying to get away from the baddies, negating everything that has happened so far.

136,gdeangel,From innovative story to just more zombies and political dystopia,1,26 January 2016,"Other reviewers have remarked as well that this second film is a far cry from the first, in plot, characters, pacing, and completeness.To join in that chorus, I would go further to say that Scorch Trials lacks even one single shred of the the originality of Maze Runner. The first movie takes quasi-utopian glade of boys at the heard of a maze patrolled by monsters. To the thinking viewer, the scenario might conjure up the minotaur maze and its use as a convenient disposal for King Minos's enemies, with a completely original take on the idea.Continuing the post-Harry Potter / Hunger Games tradition, the film-makers / writers are not content to leave you with a single great film / story... it has to be monetized into an ongoing asset. The Scorch Trials shows us what was behind the curtain after the magic show is over - and its the hackneyed go-to scenario of raging zombies and bad guy biotech corporations (an idea that hasn't been fresh since Alien). With tweens who vacillate between intolerable self-importance and short sighted whiny-ness.The idea of harvesting special chemicals from these kids falls right in line with central reveal of The Island, or even more directly, harvesting of children's brain enzymes in the the world of The Dark Tower.And zombies.

These are no ""slow mutant"" zombies mixed in here and there... we're talking about most of the film with nothing but raging, undifferentiated zombie hordes. That was fresh back when Disney made a film adaptation of Haunted Castle, but even then they knew to keep it to <5 minutes of the film... and limit the amount of CGI. Now CGI is cheap, so expect it to be used liberally - need some action? The zombie horde 3-d models have already been bought and paid for in chase scene 2. Let's just use them again in the other chase scenes! Now it's certainly still possible to come up with a ""thinking man's zombie movie"". Life After Beth jumps to mind. And maybe we'll be subjected to the ""my GF is turning zombie"" angle in film 3, but I doubt it will be anything new and refreshing. More like a way to cobble in some of the Twighlight ""OMG, you're a monster"" garbage.Speaking of romance, this film even manages to toss in a teen love triangles for good measure... or at least some soap opera esque drama that passes for a teen love triangle. Females, particularly latinas, will leave the theater buzzing: ""OMG, that bitch! I knew Thomas was too good for her! He needs to hook up with Rosa Salazar!"" Sorry I just can't resist also poking a little fun at this films blatant attempt to provide a ""racial rainbow"" of heros and heroines. While somehow the first movie managed to imbue the multi-cultural posse with a more than passably realistic chemistry, this second film simply feels like they went to the race grab-bag for the hero's, and went to Uncle Whitey's Cracker Casting agency for the bad guys. Not what ruined the film for me, but just sayin'... I didn't read the book. I don't read ""teeny-tweeny"" fiction books because I expect them to be crammed full of this kind of garbage. But apparently from other reviews, the book was a lot better than the film. So my advice, save two + hours of your life and skip this film. If you were left enthralled by the first film as I was, maybe try the book instead...",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
137,joeravioli,Teenage Dystopia meets Dawn of the Dead,5,19 September 2015,"Warning: I read the book series long before the movies came out, so I suppose my rating is slightly inflated.Action films, in my opinion, require very little to satisfy. They simply need interesting (and believable) characters, a novel concept, and of course, fun, energetic action scenes that provide a purely escapist two-hour long symphony of thrills and spills. A plot, while appreciated, should be kept to the point where it does not interfere with comprehension or enjoyment. The Scorch Trials, sadly, cannot make its characters interesting. They may all have elusive backstories, but they inspire little sympathy (or even interest) with their bland, emotionless performances. The film's concept feels like a mixture of Mad Max and a poor zombie movie. Its action scenes are shaky, dizzying, and often unsatisfying, save an incredible scene involving a window (no spoilers!). The plot is ludicrous and dry, providing little satisfaction or even the slightest clue to the overhanging mystery. If anything, the film spews out more frustratingly elusive questions than it does answers. Despite this, it is surprisingly watchable.The film retains its predecessor's constant paranoia. It opens as the Gladers are brought to a facility meant to keep them safe. In fact, this facility is simply another web of lies and false security, so the Gladers escape out of the facility and into the Scorch, a vast, stormy desert populated by zombies. Unlike the previous film, The Scorch Trials doesn't rely on slow dialogue and the occasional fast paced running scene. Rather, the dialogue is kept to a minimum (except for the never-ending chorus of ""Let's go!"", ""We gotta move!"", and ""Hurry!"") being replaced by, well, running. They run, and run, and run, but this didn't even have to be a bad thing. If the camera-work was less shaky and incoherent, the action scenes would have been spectacular.Despite my inability to find much good in this movie, I can't bring myself to denounce it as absolute junk. It is intense enough, probably because of the zombies that often announce their presence by approaching the Gladers in the quietest way possible, before suddenly appearing and giving chase, moaning all the way. Zombie movies are often quite fun, and this film is no exception. And although I can't say much for this film when it comes to character and emotion, there was one scene that was rather moving, despite the fact that a secondary character was the main subject. And Jorge. Jorge was pretty good.This movie is pretty bad. It rips off many other films as it strives to make sense of its frustrating plot, including The Hunger Games (sly love triangle), Mad Max (post-apocalyptic desert wasteland), Dawn of the Dead (zombies in the mall) and even Fast and Furious (random misogynistic party). But I still enjoyed it. I didn't care one jot about the characters, or the plot, or even what was going to happen next, but the film still offered some solid entertainment, which I readily accepted. That being said, when the third film hits theatres, I don't think I'll be lining up to see it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

139,rebeccalucy,Mostly set up but can be fun...,5,26 November 2017,"A decent action film, like the first. Some scenes can be extremely tense, particularly the chase scenes. Most of the CGI was good, but could still use some improvement. The city sometimes looked a little too fake in my opinion. All of the action is quite thrilling, the glass scene being intense. The acting was also good, my favourite being Aidan Gillen from Game of thrones. He is amazing at playing a deeply unlikable villain. Certain characters are not given enough time to expand on and feel like they come out of nowhere. There is a death scene that could have been very sad if we knew the character better. The film definitely feels like set up for the next, this could be due to it being based on a book. It needed more of pay off in this film to make it feel more than just set up for the next.I liked the twists in the film, but it needed more time explaining it.

Scorch Trials is good though not better than the first. This film introduces new characters, a new game of survival, and last but not least, CRANKS (zombies of the future). The film kind of drags, though brings a new light to the story. Now, the second movie does not stay true to the books, though opens a new door for the series as it becomes a pop culture phenomenon.""Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope has killed more of my friends than the Flare and Scorch combined.""-Brenda, Maze Runner: Scorch Trials",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
141,ryanmark-57919,"Wow, Even Better Than the First One",9,21 September 2015,"Wow, the first movie was good but the second one blows it out of the water. Director Wes Ball returns in this installment of the Maze Runner series and right away this movie presents us with great action, interesting characters, and a much more cohesive story than the first movie. Don't get me wrong, the first movie is good but the major flaw it had was the story just didn't make a lot of sense. These children have the ability to save the world so we should probably lock them in a giant maze with giant killer robots. Yeah, doesn't make much sense. This movie doesn't clear up the troubles the first one had but it does give us a much more straightforward story that for the most part makes sense.This movie picks up directly after the events of the first film. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and company have been rescued from WCKD, the company responsible for the maze and experiments, by some kind of paramilitary group that's fighting against WCKD. Unfortunately, things aren't quite what they seem and everyone has to escape the facility they're in and set off into the desolate world now known as the Scorch. The Scorch is pretty bad with the lack of supplies, killer zombie-esque creatures, and particularly strange weather phenomena but things get even worse when WCKD starts to pursue everyone. The group now has to travel across the Scorch in order to find some kind of safe haven from those that would use them against their will.The cast already did a great job in the first film but they're even better this time around. Dylan O'Brien once again is the protagonist of the group and has been shoved even more into the leadership role. This guy has some real talent and it's hard not to like the guy. One thing I really enjoyed about this film is that all of the other characters become much more important as well. I'm especially happy to see how badass Ki Hong Lee's Minho has become. In the first movie he's running from Grievers like a scaredy cat but here he's in the forefront of the fighting and protection of his friends. I'm also glad to see that Scodelario's Teresa actually has a purpose in this film. I don't want to spoil anything but she becomes very important in this movie. The first one she was introduced and made out to be important but she really didn't do anything.We also get a few newcomers this time around. Giancarlo Esposito shows up as a character named Jorge and easily steals every scene he shows up in. He's one of those lovable rogue type characters that everyone can't help but adore. Rosa Salazar's Brenda is another strong female character that is tough, but not to the point of being emotionless. I also really enjoyed the character Janson played by Aidan Gillen. This guy is such an obvious bad guy but he does it so well that it's fun seeing him chew the scenery whenever he's on screen.The Scorch itself is beautiful in a post-apocalyptic kind of way. There's so much variety from the desolate cities, underground compounds, deserts, and more that it's hard not to be interested in where they're going to end up next. The cinematography is quite impressive at times and can really take your breath away. The one thing that I'm happier about than anything is the story though. Now, this isn't Shakespeare or anything like that. There are some scenes of exposition that feel awkward at times but the story flows much better than the first movie did. Everything is explained much better and all the characters serve an actual purpose in the story. The first movie was good but the story had quite a few loose ends and unfortunately this movie doesn't wrap them all up. However, the story told in this film has far fewer flaws and all the characters serve the story, rather than the other way around.This movie really surprised me. I enjoyed the first one but I didn't think it was an extraordinary film. The sequel just seems to do everything better than its prequel and the story flows a lot better. There are a few flaws but it's easily one of the best young adult film adaptations I've probably ever seen and I'm very excited to see how it ends. I just hope they don't split the last movie in two... What did the rest of you think about the movie?",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

NOPE Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials overall still a bland boring repetitive movie this is a movie that offers absolutely nothing new and also copy/paste the more successful franchise (like the Hunger Games)EVERYTHING in this movie you already seen a hundred times from others movie from the conflict , the characters or even the ending , the script sucks it's just so mediocre even there's more action scene you fell like want to fall asleep all the time.Even though i think The Scorch Trials or Maze Runner franchise as a whole is not a terrible movie but i just getting tired of these kind of movie that just so lazy in pretty much every aspect , they just want to get these best selling novel books out to make money and that's it , there's no point why or even something memorable about it , i'm fine with repetitive stuff if it works or memorable but The Scorch Trials is not memorable it's just one of those mediocre bland movie that you will just forget until the 3rd movie came out.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
143,leosmith-11166,Weak Plot and bland acting make a poorly made film,5,18 December 2015,"The first Maze runner was better. It had a more stable plot than this piece of cinematic garbage. The film is very poorly written, and the whole story is just a bunch of teenagers running around in the desert like headless chooks, trying to escape zombie looking things that have a name, but the name is that bad I can't remember. On the bright side, there are moments that were entertaining (pretty much any scene with the zombies in them). But that's about where the good stuff ends. The acting is so terrible I swear it's rather Dylan Obrien was at gunpoint to play this role, or he was just slugging it out to the end of the week for his paycheck. But compared to the rest of the Cast, he is an academy award winner. The supporting cast are just awful, and probably wouldn't qualify to act on the Disney channel. Overall, The Maze Runner 2 lacks the strength of the first Maze Runners Plot, and the acting is so bad I suggest you sit and watch this with a vomit bag, because you're gonna need it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
144,h-62007-26888,This maze is WAY TOO SLOW,5,26 April 2021,"Well let's be real here. The first movie was pretty good. Even for those who didn't like it, I'm sure we can agree there were MUCH WORSE films out there worth steaming over. So why do we have a sequel, you may ask? Profit, of course.This one does admittedly have strengths that ca make it kind of stand out from the others of its kind. The expansion of the world of the Maze Runner is well needed and makes it larger than life, the color scheme with the sandy desert feel is great, and the actors' performances definitely show that they did try with the materials they have. But what could arguably be the best aspect of the film is the visual style, delivering on beautiful-looking renditions of dystopia, immersive backgrounds, and engaging action scenes all together.HOWEVER, there is still one problem this film has that MESSES everything up when watching. This film is SLOW. The pacing is slow, the story is slow, the tension is slow, even some of THE DIALOGUE feels slow by how the entire story wounds up as predictable, unoriginal, and by how the story constantly has a pattern of being a desert chase and desert walk on REPEAT, moving on a SNAIL'S PACE. On top of this, it also takes effect into the characters receiving a downgrade, a lack of subtlety in the entire plot, and most of the same problems from the first Maze Runner returning here.So, this has two sides. There can be some substance to be found, but there's just too little of it to make the movie overall enjoyable. 5/10 in my book.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I mean, a military group that's been fighting another military group, that had look outs in a canyon that shot at the main characters did NOT have a look out for their camp at night? Come on!!! You could see those helicopters miles away. And any group in a combat or survival situation always, ALWAYS has a look out.

You have a bunch of super powerful teenagers who are saved from an ""evil"" organization named Wicked by... Wicked. Which I am not sure if that was supposed to be a plot twist or not. This movie quite differently from the last film has zombies, which fit the cliché roles of screeching at the camera and being of no threat whatsoever to anyone let along a group of confused un armed kids. Bizarre plot stuff happens for two hours that looks like a blend of 80's apocalypse movies.

It is over loaded with genre clichés, and over all seems not very interesting.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The story did make sense.The quality of the picture is quite good but nothing beats the poverty of the overall scenario. All this excess heroism from Dylan O'Brien was getting particularly annoying, like as if he could disrupt a whole institution on his own.For the vast majority, the story is weak and kinds of fails miserably at the end. Just like in the previous part, the fighting scenes are not particularly convincing and it's quite sad really that they put away the ""robots"" for these poorly convincing zombies. At the end though, there's not factual relation between the title ""Maze runner"" and what happens within the movie which just turns out to be a boring chase.Frankly, there's really not much to say on this sequel other than the fact that it is a complete dismantling of what made part one a reasonable movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
148,fabiolpinheiro1993,"Highly entertaining sequel, It's arguable which one is the best. .",9,19 September 2015,"The first Maze Runner is one of my favourite films, definitely among the best YA film adaptations, its very original, unique, creative, distinctive but better than all, its highly addictive. Its ending all but assured i had to see the sequel, and today, i saw it...It's really really good,i loved it, i cant say if it did match my expectations or not because i didn't know almost nothing about the sequel nor i saw much about it, because i chose not to, but i can say i liked the original a bit more.The story picks up right after the first film, and it is generally about explaining the tons of mysteries left to explain in the first film (mostly in that ending), a bit more about WICKED, who are the good ones and the bad ones and what the characters want to do with all that information.Though there are still some things to explain, since in this film its all very vague and rarely mentioned, like what concretely happened to the world, and how the virus started and what really is the virus and the origins of WICKED. But i guess the sequel will explain these things.This film has a lot more action that the first, and the action scenes are very very good, overall distinctive and creative. They add some very cool new things to the story but i think that overall the first film had a more addictive story and plot. But the film is very interesting, and is still addictive, but not on the same level of the first, because there's not a precise plot, nor a highly unique or constructive one, and more they explain less mystery there is, and although there are some great twists and one that is pretty big, the first film had a lot more twists.They could have gone deeper into the backstory of Thomas, and Teresa and the Right Arm, particularly Mary, its a shame they didn't because they only talk vaguely about all this. I guess my biggest complaint about this film is the lack of backstory.The characters all return, they continue to be very cool, particularly Minho, of course Thomas is the biggest star, and there's new characters, quite a few, but Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) has to be the best of them, he steals the show, followed by Brenda (Rosa Salazar). I also wanted to know a bit more about them, but we get to know them well enough.The production values are highly good, a step up from the already good production values of the first film. The sound particularly deserves a lot of praise, its highly creative and the mixing is perfect, but the visual effects particularly the city also deserve praise. The cinematography is great. The score is very good, nothing new, but very good.The film is highly entertaining, has some very cool action scenes, has a scale much bigger than the first film, is just very good. But i don't think it is as addictive as the first, overall i think the first film is just a bit more unique. But they are almost on the same level so in the end its arguable which one is the best.

Heck, even the name says so ""the scorch trials"". I almost expected a kind of round 2 of the same kind of endurance/survival trials the first movie had to offer... and what did I get? The movie is completely remote from the storyline so far. From the very outset it has Hunger Games written all over it, and the Divergent part comes schlepping right behind it with the classical ""teenagers vs mysterious corporation run by evil people"" thing. Plus there is something else, something regurgitated by almost every horror/thriller/post-apocalypse movie that seems to be the Hollywood's running gag of sorts I will not even mention. The whole thing had that ""let's make a sequel, with a huge cliffhanger the viewers can smell a mile off, see how it goes and maybe make a third part"" feeling about it, and the ending was an unrealistic letdown. The whole movie is like a lazy second other that gets fat and does very little once married - an interesting start, and then this move is kinda like the love handles one discovers very soon after.

150,ThatAnimeSnob,I have no intention of watching the third,2,27 April 2016,"The first movie starts with a setting where everybody is a young male with amnesia (the laziest excuse to use so the protagonist needs everything to be info-dumped). This is not a good way to have a mystery. People are not trying to find the answer to a question, they are posing a question because the answer was taken.And of course the protagonist is the only one who is a special flake. Not only is he blank so everybody can easily identify with. Not only is he used as a lobotomized ask-man so everything needs to be explained to us. But on top of that in just 3 days he does things nobody else was capable to achieve in 3 years. Empowerment fantasy anyone? There is this guy who is constantly antagonizing him. He keeps hitting him and demands to stop being curious about the maze, when he is simply trying to find a way to get out, the same thing everybody is doing. The movie never justifies his actions, he is a one dimensional bully with no proper motivations.Then they throw a girl in the story, which offers nothing to the plot, she is there simply as a platonic girlfriend for the protagonist. I mean, seriously, the first thing she says is his name which instantly cock-blocks everybody else. We can't have anyone else going after the only girl in the show; she exists to be a prize for the empowerment fantasy that is the protagonist. Which still doesn't excuse why she wasn't gang-riped by everybody. How is it possible to have dozens of men in their sexual prime for 3 years who wouldn't go ape at the sight of a female? In fact why haven't any of them turned homo all this time? Three years without anyone having sex, how is that possible? And then comes the revelation at the end and it makes no sense. If the sun has scorched the earth, why were they fine under the sun? If these young people are the last hope of mankind, what was the point of stealing their memories, building a gigantic transforming maze, throwing them in the middle of a death trap where you are constantly killing them, and then making it seem to those who manage to escape the maze that the researchers who put them there were killed? Answer: There wasn't any. Their plan makes no sense.This leads us to the second movie which is a straightforward zombie apocalypse flick. The youths are taken to a new facility where they are harvested so a cure for the zombie virus can be found. Which makes sense, and is what the evil organization should be doing from the very beginning instead of wasting a fortune in making mazes and killing the ones they need to harvest. But that is too much to expect from a writer who named the organization Wicked. Seriously, that is the name of the evil organization: Wicked. So much thought put into it.Anyways, they manage to escape this new facility pretty easily, something nobody else was able to, thanks to the special flake that is the protagonist being with them. They travel through the wasteland that is earth, fend off zombies, and eventually find a resistance group named Right Hand. Because they are right, and are fighting the Wicked. God these lazy names are killing me.There is nothing worthy of note going on in the second movie. It ends with a cliffhanger where the evil wicked attack and kidnap the protagonist's platonic girlfriend, so he swears revenge, prepares to attack their evil base, and we are watching a corny action flick. I don't care about the third movie. These are terrible films, based on terrible books that are essentially light novels.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

152,Sidd_The_Movie_Slayer,Get Scorched,7,19 September 2015,"Maze Runner Scorch Trials is written T.S. Nowlin and is directed by Wes Ball. It stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster.After having escaped the Maze, the Runners now face a new set of challenges on the open roads of a desolate landscape filled with unimaginable obstacles.The Scorch Trials is a good movie. It impressed me in ways I didn't think possible, in the acting, directing and writing of this distopian survival drama. Every single thing in this movie is better than its predecessor.To start off the positives is the acting. It was great, that was expected. All three of the leads blew me away in the previous movie but they clearly upped their game just in time for this movie. The best of three brilliant performances was clearly Dylan O'Brien. He was magnetic in the lead role offering charm, wit and emotion to the character of Thomas. Its also blatantly obvious from his body language that the character is morphing into something bigger than what he was in the first movie, a hard trick to pull off. Scodelario and Brodie- Sangster are equal in power in their spirited portrayals of their characters. The main problem with the rest of their cast is they don't really try too hard stand out from the leads which really drags down the scenes with out them.Next up was my favorite part of the movie, the cinematography by Gyula Pados. The long shot in the desert shown in the trailer was one of the many gems put in place by Pados. It was intricate and beautiful. Along with his cinematography was the direction by Wes Ball. It was wonderful for a sophomore directorial effort and I believe he will only get better with time.The biggest problem with this movie was its script. I haven't read the books so I can only give a newcomer's look at the franchise. The movie is definitely well written promoting some good thrills but the whole movie feels a bit too kiddish. Though this movie has a darker tone it still suffers from the same problem as its predecessor, its made for teenagers. There's nothing wrong with this per say but I would've liked a more focused approach at making it widely enjoyable to any viewer, no matter what age.

160,darryl-42069,Beyond my expectations,7,12 September 2015,"At first sight, i thought this year's The Maze Runner movie is not going to pleased me, as I'm only seen both of it's trailers and no more news. But my mom insists and, alright I'm going to watching it. Butthis film is beyond my expectations. The start of the film is already giving me chills. The villain is terrific! It gave chills when you saw him, basically he's a bad guy you Love to hate. Then it moves on to the Scorch, a very large desert. Although i thought that it's all about survival and stuff, i wish i was wrong at that time. The film entirely changes from a thrilling movie to some kind of a horror movie. The movie nearly faints me(well it's normal since i disliked horror movies). But the action scenes was over the top. The actors were incredible, plot twists in the end of the movie was unimaginable, and the conclusion, EPIC. In the end, Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials proves that early thoughts were wrong after all. You should watch it, and for real, your early thoughts will be entirely wrong. FINAL SCORE: 9/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
161,NormanCroucher,Enjoyable YA adventure that throws in everything but the kitchen sink,6,22 October 2017,"'The Maze Runner' was a surprisingly entertaining young adult adventure with a disappointingly lame conclusion. After a good 100 minutes of finely staged set-pieces and well constructed intrigue and mystery, we were given some clunky exposition to explain what the whole story had been about in the most melodramatic and abrupt way possible in order to set-up a sequel. And this sequel, for all intents and purposes, may as well be from a different genre and film series altogether. It is so bizarrely different to its predecessor that it takes a while to reacquaint yourself with the characters and the convoluted situation the find themselves in (thanks largely to Part 1's ridiculous explanation for the maze). It's all to do with *groan* a virus that turns people into mutant zombie thingys.However, once 'The Scorch Trials' gets moving it proves itself to be just as relentlessly enjoyable as the original, sans awful ending, injecting a high-energy enthusiasm into its inventive action sequences which sees it through some problems, of which there are plenty. Part 2 is extremely weak on characterisations, relying on an audience's knowledge of the characters from a previous outing to fill in the blanks, but there wasn't much to the fresh faced cast the first time around anyway, beyond some basic personality traits and physical attributes. And then there's the plot, or lack thereof. This is essentially just one long chase across a desert with some occasional pit-stops made to help save the SFX and stunt teams some money. But the set-pieces are so well executed that whenever a plot threatens to rear its troublesome head you're almost relieved to see it smacked right back down in its place beneath all the running, jumping and escaping. This is not a franchise that does very well with plot. It does, however, do action rather well.In the seemingly endless onslaught of YA adaptations for the big screen, this is above average for the genre and stands as a fairly solid romp that chucks in just about every post-apocalyptic cliché there is, but does so with great enthusiasm and energy. It's hard to dislike a film that efficiently hits its targets, even if they are hit at extremely close range. And this time, the ending isn't abysmal.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
162,labeebster,I hate to say that I'm disappointed,4,3 September 2021,"I can't believe it :'( Why would they stray from the path this much? This isn't Ubisoft games. I tried reading the book once & partly didn't understand what was going on so I stopped reading it and after a long time I watched the first movie and liked it very much. I thought of rereading the books but I was more excited about watching the second movie. At the end of the first movie, we are told that there would be more trials. And that is what I was expecting. I don't know how much it is related to the book but I was hoping for more trials, more challenges, more puzzles to be solved, more enemies to be overcome made by WICKED etc. Instead this was an escape prison movie with a few unnecessary zombies and hence a huge let down for me. Now, it's not a bad movie. In fact it's a fair sci-fi/post-apocalypse movie. If it was a standalone movie I would have loved it but it's not. And it's so not related to the first movie apart from a few things. I can only hope that the books and the sequel are better but I'm so sad and so disappointed with the direction they took with this sequel.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
163,moviescriticnet,If you like your sci-fi mixed with simplistic but intense action this one is recommended,6,29 November 2015,"When I first watched The Maze Runner (2014), I thought it was an underground sci-fi thriller like The Cube (1997). Turns out it was a new age alternative blockbuster with teenagers fighting for survival in a dystopian future regime (like the Hunger Games and the Divergent series). Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is the second entry of what it seems will be another teen dystopian trilogy. The first movie was a sci-fi/mystery/thriller combination, while this second one focuses mainly on action. I like good action films and this one had a lot of that but like in most cases the original first film and idea are better. Nevertheless this second entry combines the element of urgency with constant running action scenes and is a nice choice to accompany your pop corn with. Direction and sound are nicely executed and the young actors' performances are solid. Dylan O' Brien will some day become a star (of course not as big as Jennifer Lawrence). So if you like your sci-fi mixed with simplistic but intense action this one is recommended.Grade: C+ (C if you watch it on TV)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The whole concept of the first movie was amazing, visually stunning, even if it strayed from the book it was a good movie.Then we have the sequel, which really isn't a sequel as far as I can tell there is no relationship between it and the first, other than they share some characters.This one went off the deep end of awful...I wanted to give it one star, but the photography was great, and it even had some pretty good actors, and even some good acting, which is surprising considering the horrible plot, script, directing....... It is so far from the book it is a crime....... Seriously someone should go to jail over this one......Don't blame the actors on this one. This is a prime example of good acting that can't save a bad plot, story........I would not even buy the DVD from the $1 bin.....",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

167,TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow,The critics don't know SH!T,8,10 September 2015,"Well well, The Scorch Trials. What a great movie!From beginning to end, I was on the edge of my seat. Unlike the first, there's a lot more violence and death in this movie, and the Cranks are OH SO HORRIFYING!And as you may have expected, along with the Cranks comes lots of JUMP SCARES!This movie is super intense and action-packed that you won't want to look away for a moment. Also, there's a single scene about 35 minutes into the movie that shocked me. It wasn't meant to be a plot twist, but the way they pulled it off was incredible. Giving that away would be sad, so I want you to see it for yourself.Let's just say that it involves an quiet, emotional scene with a gun and a slowly growing infection through someone's body. Moving on...The thing I dislike is the lack of character development in the new characters introduced. Here's some random kid shown near the beginning, then when he only appears in the background and basically says nothing, I'm like 'Wait, who is he again?' when he finally begins to speak.The first movie was all about the action, but this one is all about the action and the PLOT. Oh yes, there is a plot twist near the end I didn't see coming, and it kind of involves a familiar character.So much happens in this movie that leaves your mind blown, and it leaves you off with a sort of cliffhanger. It will leave you saying 'The game is truly on...' except the game will be on in 2017. Shame.Overall, I say IGNORE THE CRITICS! They see this as Young Adult, which technically it is, but it's more of a Young Adult horror movie! It's certainly interesting.8/10. Go see it!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
168,zhdcndmr,No logic or sense whatsoever,3,16 November 2015,"I've read the books and I have to say, the story is very confusing but you read it because you kept on expecting something new and the mystery to be revealed.The movies though, I've never seen any movie that is this convenient to the plot. They get caught by what they think is NOT wicked at first and they don't feel the necessity to question or do anything reasonable. Just find secrets.The most irritating fact though that kept reoccurring in the books and apparently also in the movies is Teresa. Teresa knows EVERYTHING about why the maze happened and what Wickd want with them but she never says while they are walking through the dessert for days ""you know what guys, we are a cure for a sickness that kills the race of humanity"" The only time she reveals some thing is in these weird short episodes when she just reveals words and hidden explanations to stuff that keeps you wondering.I never got the books and the movies goes in the same direction.

The sequel to Maze Runner is absolutely NOTHING like the book, and I sincerely weep for those who haven't read the series and don't have a clue that this is not how the story goes. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book series, so much so that when the first movie came out I was jumping with joy. Unfortunately, after the Maze Runner installment went fairly well along with the book plot, the sequel did NOT. I'm not sure why the writers felt it was necessary to steer away from the actual story so much so that basically the ONLY thing they got correct were the characters names(not including the characters they made up along the way to fulfill their completely made up story line), and that Minho gets struck by lightening(in the movie it's way less gruesome and more light-hearted). I am so unbelievably disappointed with this movie. I will have to see the final film just to finish it off, but I'm telling you if they end it without even ending it properly(if that makes sense) I'm going to be furious.

171,ahassan-12342,Maze Runner trips up in disappointing follow-up,5,1 April 2016,"Following their escape from the mysterious labyrinth in the first Maze Runner, we meet up with our Gladers in a facility run by WCKD- geddit(!)- who may or may not want to harvest the blood of our young adult protagonists. While the enclosed space of the Glade in the first film drew plenty of similarities to Lost- the Scorch Trials has a feel similar to The Walking Dead with the zombie-like Cranks attempting to spread the Flare virus to those still unaffected. The scenery is far more expansive than its predecessor with some excellent post-apocalyptic landscapes. In particular, buildings are seen leaning on other buildings- providing the setting for an imaginative action scene with the zombies.However, the vast majority of the run time consists of the group running away from things- Cranks, lightning strikes, noises- and this begins to tire after a while. There is very little in terms of plot development in the middle third of the film. You could skip the middle 40 minutes and it would still make as much sense. What was also disappointing is that many of the questions from the first Maze Runner remained unanswered. Clocking in at over two hours, it had plenty of time to do this.Scorch Trials is salvaged somewhat with an anarchic finale which was just about enough to retain interest for the franchise's concluding film. Giancarlo Esposito is also excellent in the first performance I have seen from him since Breaking Bad. However, while the first Maze Runner gave the franchise a solid foundation, Scorch Trials has unfortunately dropped the ball.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Zombies was the only thing why this was one star worse than first movie.But Like in the first movie, actors are brilliant! Special effects and milieu is just fascinating and stunning! I really like how this was written and directed, how things is getting forward. I haven't read the book and I'm not gonna read. And I don't personally give a s*** about illogical things in the story line; like how the world is ended up like that. Where the infection came from etc. And how much this is different from book...The movie itself is just amazing and exciting to watch and you really can feel the suspense.

174,cfcurrie,A perfectly acceptable teen action movie for teens.,6,10 October 2015,"In the current climate of tween/teen action sci-fi franchises releasing sequel after sequel, the Maze Runner series seems to be at the bottom of the barrel. Does that make it a waste of time? No. But it does mean its a little to forgiving of implausible scenarios, oh-so- last-minute saves and lots of running around to nowhere quick action while breaking through your suspension of disbelief. Yes. Of course, if you're in the target audience of teenager or younger, this is pure heavenly fantasy. It should be noted that if your child scares easily, the ghouls throughout the second act can be a bit graphic, but nothing that would shake the constitution of the average 12 year old.If you're a parent, this is going to be a difficult sit thru. Unlike most newer tween focused films that lace sophisticated adult humor in between the lines, this is all bland stuff. Thankfully, what's happening in the grand narrative is explained pretty clearly, so no leaning over to your kid to ask whats so important about these folks on screen. All will be revealed. Unfortunately, you will be asking a ""Who's that?"", as a couple characters get picked up for no clear reason (fodder for the threequel?), or why the group is going here or there, but is likely there's no reason you kid would know either. It's just to fill out plot. There is a remarkably good (in relative blockbuster terms) production feel to this movie. I still imagine that once this franchise is complete it will, along with all of its actors, fade into obscurity. But for now, it's great matinée fare, and shouldn't be analyzed to deeply. Just enjoy the cool post-apocalyptic feel, great damaged cityscapes, all to familiar mall/zombie combination and absurd ""final"" shoot out.

176,urbanlegend23,A disappointing sequel to 2014's promising young-adult sci-fi film.,5,25 June 2016,"""The Maze Runner"" was one of 2014's biggest surprises, but unfortunately its immediate sequel ""The Scorch Trials"" sends this franchise somewhat off the rails, lacking the components that made the first film so entertaining.""The Maze Runner"" worked extremely well because it grasped a simple concept and rendered it intriguing and highly entertaining for those naiive to novelist James Dashner's young-adult book series. ""The Scorch Trials"" does the opposite. The more it reveals about this post-apocalyptic dystopian future, the less interesting and more formulaic it seems to become. The film gets so bogged down in overly convoluted, exposition-heavy storytelling that it's hard to care, for instance, about the discovery of an important resistance group in the final third. The 'shocking' cliffhanger is equally a ""meh"" moment. By this point the film has, like a vacuum, sucked out a lot of what was interesting about the first film.As protagonist Thomas, Dylan O'Brien competently holds the film on his shoulders. He's charismatic and convincingly physical and intense. But the surrounding film lets this young actor down significantly. It's bereft of character development. Try naming anyone other than Thomas, and perhaps Patricia Clarkson's icy villainess Ava Paige who isn't completely forgettable. Kaya Scodelario in particular flounders, appearing to give her best Kristen-Stewart-in-Twilight impression, and failing to find depths in her explicable character, who is responsible for a couple of big plot twists.The film at least manages to be fun some of the time - for the first third it is essentially one big chase scene. A nightmarish, claustrophobic and surprisingly-violent-for-this-age-group attack on the central heroes by zombie-like desert inhabitants is undeniably pulse-pounding. But even then, that otherwise-well-done sequence ends at an 'oh well', abrupt anticlimax. It's the first sign of the choppiness that will remain consistent through the rest of the film (another sequence featuring a desert storm is similarly lazily resolved - it cuts to the characters suddenly, and inexplicably, under shelter in fine weather). What are we to invest in a film that lacks the resolve to see these intense encounters through to the end?And, eventually, even the film's fun chases become a bit exhausting and tiresome. At least one could've been cut to match the first film's tight plotting and pacing. ""Trials"" is notably overlong and plodding, especially in its aforementioned third act, where all but the most invested of viewers will have lost interest. One hopes that the third film can redeem this franchise, but it'll take a lot to restore investment from the viewers - such as myself - who found this second instalment severely disappointing.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

When the first zombies appear, the first thing I thought was ""they have got out of original ideas"" and that is a pity because it could've become a good film to watch just by following the main principles of the first film. It just happens that I feel that the zombie concept has been very stereotyped and when you see one you have seen all. There are even several TV series where the main characters are zombies with the same bizarre expressions on the face and the perverse convolutions on their bodies.Another disappointment is the attitude of the main character that in most scenes has the same expression of awe in control. Strangely enough the director has made these scenes with that same expression unnecessary long which results making the film to seem boring and slow.Thus the genre of the film perhaps should evolve from science fiction to horror film.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Somehow, he is the only one who can save the entire human race. He has major memory holes in his mind, yet somehow he is the only one capable of understanding what goes on and making the choices for the good of himself and his friends. There are more non key details that make no sense. The movie is full of them. Like when the command is given to take Thomas and his friends alive, why do the guards immediately start shooting at them? Near the start of the movie, they are in a medical facility. The world is largely consumed by a plague. Thomas and his friend see some people been wheeled around on medical stretchers. Somehow this is highly suspicious. I mean no way can sick people be on stretchers in a hospital. Of course in this bizarre plot, the paranoia actually turns out to be correct. I guess there would be no movie otherwise. Anyway, I find it mind boggling that there are books and movies like this that portray doctors as evil and clueless teens as heroes in a world devastated by a plague.Hey I got an idea for a book/movie.

While the first film was all about confusion, constant running and spooky monsters, the second one opens the perspective on the whole post-apocalyptic world, with its tragedies and hopes. Of course, main elements of the movie are standard. Evil, wicked corporation, desert thugs and rebels, and your everyday zombies - we've seen 'em all, true. Yet it is interesting to watch, because, 1. These are kids, not some motley crew of hunters/ex cops, marines/all- knowing scientists, just kids alone in the dark, without skills, smartness or inner aggression. And 2. This is not about killing zombies or even finding cure, - bit simple escape to nowhere. And the absence of rather sickly ""real scenes"" adds up much to the positiveness of the movie.I really prefer this one to the first. Diversity of scenery is new and pleasant, the town sunk in sands looks interesting, and there is a sense, feeling of the open air. The plot is not just about ""This is the maze we need to get out so run"", but deeper - the price of cure, sacrifice or betrayal, loyalty and doubt. Barry Pepper was very good at his some 10 minutes of screen time) Haven't seen him in movies for ages) Also there is a rare touch of humanity in this movie, more than in the first. These zombie survival flicks, so immensely enjoyed by many peaceful residents, safe and protected, and yet longing for adventure, tend to concentrate on the extreme violence and gore. It is understandable, those who never experienced the world of violence and feel safe, like the patricians of the ancient Rome , demand the entertainment of blood and death.

187,jim_flowers,Just another apocalyptic zombie movie,3,17 September 2015,"Just another apocalyptic zombie movie.The original installment of Maze Runner was an interesting thriller / action movie. The suspense of where the boys came from, who put them there, what was in the maze, and was there a way out through the maze made for a good ride.Now, after they've escaped the maze we learn that WCKD is good, or is it? At the end of Part 1 we learned they were is some sort of an experiment and there was some species ending disaster that had to do with a virus that only the young were immune to. I wonder though, what the maze experiment had to do with discovering or enhancing the young's ability to resist the virus, there were medical tests for that. But alas, that was the 1st installment.Now in The Scorch, they've escaped the maze and arrived (rescued?) at a WCKD facility, presumably to rest and recuperate. WRONG, they're to be milked of their life saving serum, much like a vampire milks it's prey.They get wind of the WCKD's intentions and become obsessed with hooking up with the ""Right Arm"" which transfers young ones like themselves to greener pastures where they'll be safe. EENNKK, wrong bub, they are a rebel force bent on destroying WCKD.Did I mention the ZOMBIES they encounter on the way to Oz? It appears that the species ending virus, before it kills the human population turns people into, well, run of the mill, plain old flesh eating ZOMBIES.Bet you didn't see that one coming? Another, blind side, that I'm guessing you'll miss, UNLESS you're a complete MORON, the end leaves the door wide open to a 3rd installment.

Not to mention the fact that they invent characters and then give them no introductions or meaningful characteristics. They couldn't even portray the landscape accurately. If you enjoy films with no depth that are almost purely driven by action, you'll love this. The sad thing is that I respect all of the actors and actresses in this movie. They did the best with the useless garbage they were contractually obligated to perform. They all have great work outside of this film, and I hope it doesn't kill any of their careers. Utter disappointment, don't waste your time. I can't believe the author of the books was OK with this....",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
190,JanisU,I am sad,6,3 December 2015,"After watching the first movie, I was really surprised how good it was! I even gave 7 out of 10, but after watching second part I am feeling super disappointed. And not because of the lack of action or special effects, because everything of that was in it, but because of lack of scenario and way too obvious ending of the second movie. In my opinion it is not a bad thing to go against well known rules how to make movie, to make it more realistic! If someone has to die, he has to die! I was hoping for something unexpected, because there could be a lot to give, but nothing was given! Over all I felt like the movie creators shown me a cake , but didn't give not even a piece of it to eat! Such a potential, but lack of scenario killed it!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
191,danjross29,It was Good.... and Bad....,5,21 November 2015,"I watched this film not knowing what will happen. And I was pretty disappointed with the movie. For one, the pacing was Idiotic!! 32 Minutes into the Film and BOOM!! Action!! BOOM!! Cranks!! In the Next Maze Runner Movie, S L O W Down the pace. And the Cranks look Terrible!! They look like Zombies in CGI that only have stupid noises. GWAAH!! GWA!!! Dumb!! Now as well as I completely butchered this film in this review I also liked some things in the Scorch Trials. Some things in this mess of a movie were...... Emotional. The pressure for Winston's survival makes you want to watch more to make sure he survives from the Flare Virus that one of the Cranks passed on to Winston after Winston got scratched. And when Winston does die of shooting himself in the head, I found myself sad. But the Action is VERY creepy. The Cranks do look like garbage but I got straight into the Action when the Cranks chased Minho, Thomas, Aris, Teresa, Newt, Frypan and Winston in the Deserted Shopping Mall. Anyway I rate this film a 5/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

CGI (was it CGI idk don't come for me I'm not familiar with editing terms) was fantastic, effects were top notch and the music score was amazing.Acting-wise, Dylan was great. He has always been a fantastic actor but I'm glad to see it in a YA role.This movie was action-packed and it gave me all the sense of adventure I needed. I just wish we had more scenes with the OG people to make this all the more sentimental.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
193,Sabre-El,Very engaging,8,24 December 2015,"I am one who has never read the books, and so cannot (and do not want to) weigh if the movie is true to its source material. But I did watch the first part and was really looking forward to this one. I found the movie quite engaging. 90% of the time there was some action going on and it was always an interest in what will go on next.The pace of the movie was adequate, even with around a 2 hour run-time and the acting was good. One of the few problems I have with the movie is that it doesn't really give an insight to its prequel. One has to have watched the previous movie to understand what is going on. They also don't really explain what certain terms e.g. Scorch, mean. This is probably surprising given that they did give quite a lot of answers to questions that were springing up in my brain while watching the movie.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. Having read other people's reviews, I feel that the ones who have read the books will be disappointed. So my suggestion is not to expect too much in that regard",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
194,RyanMatheson13,More action than its predecessor but disappointing in it's screenplay,8,11 April 2017,"As a huge fan of YA books turned film, I had high expectations for Scorch Trails having thoroughly enjoyed the novel. This was a difficult watch as the movie is well done with its pace, visuals, & likable cast; however, it deviated on a large scale in its screenplay by TS Nowlin. The premise in the novel, in my opinion, made allot more sense and it was disappointing when it was not translated. I understand filmmakers sometimes need to adjust original material to make it more appealing to the masses but in this case it was a frustrating second instalment for those fans of the Maze Runner trilogy.Now, despite being one of the many individuals that was displeased with this deviation, I still enjoyed the movie Wes Ball put together. It does its job by giving it's audience more action than the first & appropriately sets up for the conclusion in Death Cure. I am sure if Dashner had have been put on as an executive producer on this film, I think we would have seen some material more true to the novel. This did not happen but I don't believe this film merits a 1/10 rating. If you enjoyed Maze Runner (2014), you'll find this second instalment enjoyable as well.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Fast paced to nowhere with lots of movement, little action, noisy and pointless. Gee, the obtuse teenager tries to save his buddies from having their blood sucked out of them by the mean scientists and from being bitten by the zombie creatures. And the soldier group -- the right wing so to speak -- are so rag tag as to be an impossible group to put up any kind of struggle against the crack troops of WCKD... wicked. (wasn't that clever!) When searching for the rag tag group, they get stuck in a canyon behind cars left to barricade their hiding place. Then they get attacked -- are you ready -- with the ubiquitous helicopters that everyone in the known universe knows WCKD has... except the right appendage (I don't want to give away their clever name).Just wish this group had gotten lost in the maze.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
198,MegaGothmog,A feel-good Running man movie,6,20 October 2015,"I watched it like, 20 minutes ago, so this review is as fresh as i can make it :) To say it very short: It was a feel-good movie, that should have been given a different name.As is traditional with my reviews, i'll start with the good sides of the movie.The movie took little to no time to develop. Within the first 10 minutes stuff already goes down. Within 15 minutes, sh*t has already hit the fan. So you don't need to wait for stuff to get interesting.There were a lot of moments that were really cool. Those feel-good moments, where you can sit there and think: ""Ah that was cool!"" ""WOW did you see that?"" ""Oh man, that character was bad-ass there!"" Those kind of moments. There were plenty of them so unless you have no feeling of suspense, you won't walk out of the theater without anything to remember.The acting overall was also pretty nice. Oscar-worthy? No, hell no. But it was good nonetheless. The one actor/actress did it better than the other but i cannot complain.The visual effects and make-up all looked pretty darn good so you are also in for a visual ride. Everything did look like 50-shades of brown, but since the whole movie takes place in a desert-like environment, you can't really argue with that.Now for the bad parts. I'll try to keep everything a secret and not reveal anything.There were too many moments that were basically the same: They go to this place, find out stuff is bad, and have to run. And this goes on 6 times in a row. Why do they call it the Scorch Trials? Call it the Running Men.As i said before, there are a lot of feel-good moments in the film. But in between those moments, there is not a whole lot to see. This film basically thrives on those moments and tries to keep the scenes between those moments as short as possible. Since the movie takes no time to develop, there is little to no introduction of characters. Aidan Gillen (Janson) (and Petyr Balish from GoT) has a pretty impact-full role, but gets a 2 minute intro and that is it.There were also plenty of moments where i thought: ""Seriously? Are you kidding?"" ""Wait what? Do they even....?"" I cannot say what those moments exactly were, so sorry for that, but there were plenty of those moments, and unless you are not paying attention, you WILL notice them.All in all, the movie was entertaining, but very flawed. As i now say for the 6th time, there were a lot of feel-good moments, but also plenty of weird moments, weird choices the characters make, and once again: Thomas is the most important character of them all, and only he can save the day. SERIOUSLY? Why can't this other dude do something? Isn't it so that Thomas is not the only one in the team? Ah, screw it. I'll watch Vikings again.In total i can give it a 6.5, maybe a 7, but no more than that. I have no idea if the book is any better, so don't judge me for that :)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
199,peggyatthemovies,I got somewhat lost in this new 'MAZE' in The Scorch,3,16 September 2015,"Assuming that you have a good enough memory to remember where the first film finished as before reading my own review from the first one, the only thing I truly remembered was the main characters Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Minho (Ki Hong Lee) & Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and along with the fact one of my fav. characters Gally (Will Poulter) died.Here in Scorch Trials we're thrust straight away into Thomas and company's bust from the World Catastrophe Killzone Department aka WCKD; (side note: seemingly no one realized the connotations of the acronym until after the business cards had been made *eyeroll). Missing his memories and suspicious of anyone over the age of 21, before we can even blink an eye..Thomas is once again leading a breakout from the complex he and his buds are being held in after being rescued from the maze. This includes newcomer to the group Aris (Jacob Lofland) and a new mean guy Janson (Aiden Gillen) who is up to something, but before we can find out any answers as to why kids are being ""harvested"" and what the purpose of the maze was and Thomas's role in it, poof!! they're out into 'The Scorch', a desolate wasteland and busted-up city that uses must have used the leftover sets from Insurgent – hey..I'm all for budget saving. :)As noted in my review of the original Maze Runner, this one too borrows heavily from not only other popular YA films (think Twilight, Insurgent etc), but also every other popular trope lying around. Suddenly we've got Walking Dead type zombies – we've got running up buildings – we've got a political resistance with no clear aim – And we've got more questions asked than a 3 year old at the playground. Despite the bum- numbing (ouch!) running time, as again with all this type of genre film they could easily cut out 30-40 minutes from each one, every new character Thomas and his nameless mates encounter exclaim, ""There's no time to explain, we have to go!"" to the point of where you just want to scream ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING?""There's also little time given to reintroducing some of the characters that barely made it from the first film. We know Thomas and Teresa, and that guy from Game Of Thrones, but the supporting cast are essentially just there to be dispensed with to provide some sense of jeopardy. At one point, the boys reminisce about their fallen numbers; ""Aww, do you remember Chuck? And Winston? They were definitely here."" No, I do not remember them; I don't even remember what my life was like before I started watching this film. At one point, Theresa tells Thomas a story about her mother slowly turning mad to the point she plucked out her own eyeballs. After two hours and 11 minutes, I think I felt her pain..Which is a huge shame because the first installment was so promising I truly thought that the second would be better. And it almost was for a bit..sadly it didn't remain moving in that right direction. Though I will cough up to the fact that O'Brien is a fairly charismatic lead when all he had to do was jump around the maze, but now he's given precious little to do other than run around with that chicken head cut- off syndrome.Teresa who when in the maze, set the whole chain of events into motion, is literally carried throughout by the boys and her relationship with Thomas, both before and after the maze, is not ever really touched on. A brief flirtation between Thomas and resistance fighter/soon-to-be- zombie Brenda (Rosa Salazar) has little consequence; same with what her father figure Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) who I'm still not sure if he is the 'Right Arm' they were so desperately trying to find or not. Throw in Vince (Barry Pepper) or Mary (Lili Taylor) as possible Right Arm leaders also and truthfully I was just a bit confused or maybe tired by that point. The whole film, while not bad, made me wonder if you would be any the wiser if you read the books as early on director Wes Ball dispenses with the original story and gives us a sadly DSAPPNTNG ending to this second installment of the sage.Grade: D @pegsatthemoviesScreening: Tuesday, September 15, 2015 – Courtesy of 20th Century Fox Nationwide release: Friday, September 18, 2015",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I enjoyed the first movie, The Maze Runner, but overall, The Scorch Trial has better entertainment value and really adds to the plot. I also liked the creatures that were infected with the flare virus.A solid movie. If IMDb had a scale to rate between the numbers, I would rate this movie at probably around a 7.5. It isn't quite an 8, so a 7 is what I put. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of zombie movies, dystopian and futuristic movies, or The Hunger Games, to watch this movie.

202,matrixpolaris,"Fun, even more flawed, and a little less pulse-pounding.",5,30 September 2016,"Now, before I wrote this, I wrote a review on the first one, and I loved it. This one? Not so much. I mean, the fun-factor is still there, but definitely not as much. Now, starting with the positives, the action is still top-notch, and the casting of Aiden Gillen was true masterpiece. Dylan O'Brien is just as good as last time, and the mall escape was great. The special effects were so good, and again, the characters still intrigue us. And we really care about them. I felt emotional when Chuck died in the first one, and Winston's death is just as sad. Wes Ball really knows how to do sad moments.On to the negatives. Now, in my first Maze Runner review, I said that it deviated too far from the book. For this one, times that by 10. Everything is really different. These are just a handful of scenes that weren't in the book: The Gladers escaping the facility, WCKD arriving in Crankland, Brenda getting bitten by a Crank, them getting picked up by Right Arm, and lots more. And also, they turned Cranks into mindless zombies, making it more Walking Dead than Scorch Trials. Also, the large subplot that there was another maze, was relegated to a small mention at the start of the film. And there are so many underdeveloped characters. Seriously. And just like the last film, it feels so rushed, and also contains a scene identical to that of Jurassic Park 2. Watch it, and you'll know what I'm talking about. In general, this film just doesn't have the Maze Runner feel. Period.If you're fans of the books, like me, then you will either hate it, or think it's okay, like me. If you want to watch it, do so, it's fun and exciting, and contains good action, but if you want quality YA, then watch the first one. Or just watch the Hunger Games.

204,workingclasshero,Complete and utter cr*p,2,22 November 2015,"Sorry, I can't say much more about this. I don't know the books, they might be and probably are much better than the movies. The first part was OK, the maze was rather intriguing and kept you wondering, who would create such a gigantic riddle just to test a few teens. The second part does not only not answer this question, it actually makes the first part look completely stupid in hindsight, as nothing about it makes sense anymore. What exactly was the point of this billion-dollar-construction, that must have taken decades to build? *** Attention spoilers from here on ***Also, besides the pointlessness of the maze, a lot of other things about the plot do not make any sense. For example, having just escaped some nightmarish maze, created by an apparently completely crazy organization, the protagonists arrive in the next maze-like building. There, they are treated like cattle, much in the same way as before, but suddenly they think everything's alright, because now they have a bed? They keep defending their captors and applaud some silly story about getting transfered to paradise, and only one or two of them raise any suspicion that not all might be as it seems? When they finally escape, they run about 3 minutes away from the compound and find shelter in a huge structure that could only be a few hundred meters away. But the pursuers look everywhere except in there? And the ""evil"" doctor actually expects to convince a group of people to agree to being hung down and drained of bodily fluids, because well that's the only hope we've got? This is all so stupid it hurts.I could go on and on, but it is pointless. They go from one chase-scene to the next, dumb as ever. The f/x where decent so I give it a 2. But the script, the acting and everything else about this movie is just a horrible mess - or rather an unoriginal collection of bad writing, bad acting and plot holes.

205,thejasvi,"Never read the books, I really liked the movie!",8,9 February 2016,"The first Maze Runner was for me the saving grace of the first generation of YA films, Wes Ball did a magnificent job of making a first class action adventure for a relatively low budget. It was entertaining, and at time thought provoking, and full of fantastic performances from a young cast. The mystery of being in the glades really added to the film and wondering what was behind the maze. There were only a couple of cliché moments, otherwise I was a massive fan of it. When the sequel came out, all I heard was negativity, and some of the harshest comments i've heard for a film. I feared the first film was a fluke, and that the sequel would be like other YA films, massive budget and brilliant production design, but completely lacking in solid story telling. I avoided the film for a long time, until tonight when I was in the mood for a big budget visual film.I have to say I can't understand the negativity geared towards the film at all, I thought the sequel was a truly well made action adventure, one of the best I've seen in a long time, and trust me I watch a LOT of films. Yes there are again a few cliché moments, that make you question the characters, otherwise it really is a truly entertaining film, with some of the better action scenes I've seen this year. And there needs to be some genuine applause and adulation for the Production Designer, the sets and production value is truly amazing. I'm 34 years old, I hate stupid films with lazy writing and directing. This film has none of that, i think I enjoyed it more than more or less all the other big tent pole films of 2015. I don't care about whether the source material wasn't copied or seemingly respected, this is a film version of the book, I really can't comment on whether or not the adaption should have been closer to the source, all I know is that I thought the film was a great example of the Hollywood blockbuster.I think in many ways I actually thought it succeeded the first movie, if for any other reason, that for the roller-coaster ride it offers.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I did not like how it was against Thomas all the time, I mean common he was suffering almost throughout the whole book. The only bad points in the movie were that the sick people were zombies without explaining how they got sick and what are the stages and also that Teresa was not significant at all in the movie but in the book she played quite crucial role of the betrayer.

The Village Vs. Lord of the Flies, but it had a lot of heart from a first time director with something to prove on a 'low' budget and The Scorch Trials is more of the same in that respect, albeit with double the budget of the first.*Isn't it ironic that we live in the midst of a global economic crisis yet $30m is considered 'low budget' for a movie?*Politics aside, What gives this series as an edge is the energy from director Wes Ball and the cast, who give depth and instant likability to the characters, somewhat lacking in other YA films.The core fan-base is obviously annoyed that this movie deviated wildly and I understand that completely, I would be too, but as an action/thriller sequel, and separate to the books, there are a lot worse ways to spend a cold, wet, winter day.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

210,david-m-b95,A relentless Dystopian thriller (minor spoilers),6,11 September 2015,"2014's 'The Maze Runner' was a surprise box office hit, earning $340 million worldwide from a modest $32 million budget and hitting the right notes with both critics and audiences a like, so naturally the studio has quickly moved onto the next chapter of the Maze Runner story, with most of the principal cast returning as well as a few new additions. And naturally, this sequel seeks to build upon the groundwork of The Maze Runner and expand the world established, whilst also upping the ante.And boy does it.This time around, the Gladers are finally free of the maze and things seem to be heading in a much more positive direction as they recover from their traumatic and harrowing time within WCKD's deadly experiment. However when Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), with the help of another former Glader from a separate Maze, Aris (newcomer Jacob Lofland), uncovers the truth of what is soon to happen to them, he leads his friends in an escape into what is known only as The Scorch. With rumours of a resistance forming and a potential safe haven from the destruction of the surrounding world, the Gladers must fight through the Scorch to safety, if the conditions don't kill them, then the Cranks, a disease ravaged group of zombie like creatures, will.The journey of this film covers a broad range of sprawling and gorgeous locations; from beautiful but ravaged cities to huge stretches of desert and mountain landscapes, the production design of this movie is incredible and truly breathtaking. The visual effects are great and we are treated to some truly special action set pieces throughout the narrative. The film is beautifully shot, some shaky cam action scenes aside, with a great score that really adds to the tense and eerie atmosphere of the movie.Dylan O'Brien again proves to be a strong lead for this franchise and his fellow Gladers Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Frypan (Dexter Darden), Winston (Alexander Flores) and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) all pitch in to help carry the film through perhaps it's more downbeat and slightly duller moments, particularly in the film's first half whilst also shining in the film's biggest and best moments.However the introduction of Giancarlo Esposito and Rosa Salazar really spices up proceedings with both actors fully embracing their roles, particularly Giancarlo Esposito who almost steals the whole movie. Aiden Gillen is a solid addition as the film's antagonist Janson, a man intent on getting what he wants without being afraid of getting his own hands dirty. He really helps to shape the narrative and gives the film a much needed villain after the ambiguity of the first film.As previously mentioned, the film does suffer from some dull moments in the narrative in the first half. There's a lot of shots of the Gladers running and then sleeping or breaking and we don't really get to fully become invested in the first part of their journey, it seems a bit filler for the film's 130 minute run time.But the second half really does pick up and helps the film to become the thriller that it was intended to be. The story takes some big twists and turns and the film really digs it's claws in and we start to become fully invested in this film and it's characters, the run time adding positively to the experience here as we get to know the characters more and learn more about this world and what has happened to make it as it is.Overall this is a great action, sci-fi thriller that serves as an excellent sequel to the first film and sets up this universe perfectly for the third chapter in this series.Definitely worth seeing on the big screen!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

However if you look at it as part of the series, it's not that great. There's a big difference between the book's storyline and the movie adaptation and not in a good way. In the book, The Scorch Trials, actually is a trial. In the movie it's more of a renegade story. Because of that the movie doesn't make as much sense as The Maze Runner when it comes to storytelling. In The Maze Runner it all made sense because the whole setup was being explained to you as you were watching and the end was logical as the end of the movie coincided with the end of the first trial. In The Scorch Trials there is none of that.

Sorry, but I really do not care if everything is going to be cleared up in the next movie because this one was so unremittingly depressing and awful that I would not watch the next one if you payed me to do so.From what I have read here, the books are nothing like the movies. So you have to ask, why bother? And thus, why bother watching it?

214,leon-radford,Ran out of ideas?,1,11 September 2015,"The Maze Runner was great. I'd almost say Excellent !But the Scorch Trials is a complete waste of time. My gf and I were massively disappointed, after anticipating this movie since seeing part 1. I can only assume that the director ran out of ideas on part 1 (TMR) or that the screenplay writer simply couldn't follow the amazing job of part 1's screenwriter.It seemed that part 1 was made and everything thrown at it. And maybe they didn't think anymore would be made? Therefore when part 2 was commissioned, they went ""OH ... we have no more story ideas or direction ideas""Not really spoilers ahead ... BUT ... If you took out every clichéd chase and every clichéd scene, the movie would be an hour long. Which would be better imo. As I was willing the film to finish because I was bored. And the death of a character that we'd only just met wasn't a teary moment at all. I couldn't care less. Just met them, not bothered. The film should be renamed ""Maze Runner: The Scorch"" as there were no trials. I think the title is misleading.Won't be going to see next installment after this abysmal effort. Such a shame after a great first film.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
215,idoyam,All In One !! - Better than the first one,7,17 September 2015,"The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials has a lot of reasons why it is better than the first one,but also many reasons that makes it a recommended movie to watch but not a perfect one!On the one hand,the movie has tons of action scenes,much more than the first one.also, the directer adds much more thrilling scenes that sometimes made me feel like this is a horror movie. the movie is also very good because the actors are playing awesome and reliable!On the other hand, The film has scenes that are repetitive and boring.Another major problem with the movie is that it fails in trying to connect the actors in the group with the audience, I felt it mostly when they tried to make some emotional scenes with actors that i didn't really care about.Finally,the movie is better than the first one,it also adds more action,horror and thriller scenes. The movie is very entertaining and also very enjoyable,you won't feel disappointed!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Characters and story are believable and interesting enough to make you care. The bad guys actually have a legit motive for doing what they do instead of just evil, with capital E, where you don't need to explain anything, they're just the bad guys. All of these leads to massive increase in my enjoyment of the movie.Watching the first movie feels like a chore, but watching this actually made me want to watch the third movie.

217,godzluvchild,Bittersweet but overall good...,7,10 May 2020,"I was looking forward to seeing the second installment of this movie trilogy. I was not disappointed in action and adventure. The movie has plenty of it! Outside of the kids cussing, the primary reasons why I have downgraded my rating is because one, the ""cranks"", two, the storyline itself and three, the supposed love story. I'm not big on the zombie thing anymore. This movie does well without the zombie stuff. The storyline loses me a little because the reason for testing the kids doesn't make sense in relation to finding a cure to the Flare disease. How does testing brain activity in times of stress create a cure for a disease that's obtained by getting bitten? Especially since the movie showed that the kids were clearly able to get infected just as easily as anyone else. Thirdly, the romance between Thomas and Teresa...I had no idea they even liked each other! I did not get that from the first movie at all. And honestly, the story has so much content that a romance is not needed. So, like I said, bittersweet...but overall, good.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

This movie is a little slower than the first one which makes my rating go down but that is probably the only thing that made me go down. The story itself sets itself up for a third instalment which I'm now very excited to see. You could see the end coming and it still surprised me even though I knew what was going on.

219,apaksoy,Worth seeing it in a theater only if you are really into zombie movies,6,23 October 2015,"Better visual effects and more action but less suspense (unless zombies really scare you) and more predictability than the first one. This seems to be one of those movies where the trailer is significantly better than the movie. A bit of a waste of time unless you are really into zombie movies. Less character development and a more shallow look into the characters than the first one. More like a horror movie with some action. Plot does not include too much intrigue to make the movie really interesting. You will probably want to see it and still enjoy it if you have seen the first one but otherwise you may have better choices. I was looking forward to seeing it but I came out somewhat disappointed because I am not really into zombie movies. Yes, that is pretty much it. A good quality zombie movies with somewhat weak plot and significant predictability. Don't hurry to see it but rather wait so that you don't spend as much money unless you are a zombie junkie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
220,JasperSnelleman,"If you loved the first one, you'll love this one!",5,30 September 2015,"Oh it is sad seeing all these reviews where people complain about this movie because it's different from the book. Well let me tell you, films based on books or comics and stuff like that change things around to make the movie stand on its own and be appealing to multiple people. There's no point in a movie that is exactly the same to its source material because that's only useful for people too lazy to read. If everyone knew this and understood it, perhaps people who don't like that idea could just stay away from the movies and keep to the books, this movie and countless others could be saved all that ruthless hate. Anyway, back to the movie, I loved the first Maze Runner film. 9/10 and it became one of my favourite movie universes out of all the others like Hunger Games and Divergent. Now I have seen the next Maze Runner film and I loved it so much. I found it better than the first one! This is how I think sequels should be made. Where things stay true to the previous film so the sequel feels like a continuation of the story and not someone elses interpretation of what happens next. The action, the music, the emotion, the characters and the story I found was so fitting, exciting, entertaining and perfect for the Maze Runner movies. I haven't read the books, I personally don't care for them, but the movies are perfect enough for me, standing on their own. I had a great time with this movie and CAN'T WAIT for Death Cure. Unfortunately this movie and the previous one receives a lot of hate and I'm so disappointed so all I can say is if you liked the first one, go and see Scorch Trails.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

222,cumpeled,Should not have been made,1,4 July 2016,"I actually enjoyed the first installment of these movies (Mazerunner).. and I say first because it looks as though they have a long and healthy plan to continue the movie franchise for as long as they can possibly milk it. This movie, Scorch Trials, literally gave me a severe headache. Lots of noise and flashing lights all to no avail. Thank God, this is another movie I was able to catch for free on Xfinity. I was wondering why such a recent movie was being offered for 'free' already, when many others hang in there at a premium rental cost. Now I know. I was almost expecting to see the cast somehow caught again in the original maze or another maze, etc. Nope. It is all about escaping their rescuers, some desert roaming and Thomas' usual ridiculous and unrealistic antics. Not only do you get Scorch Trials, but you are also able to view mini rip off scenes from at least half a dozen different, previous movies. Really embarrassing.. For example: you get some 'Walking Dead' zombies, along with a lot of Walking Dead rip off ideas such as getting infected by a scratch by said zombie, pre-zombies found having committed suicide, using zombies as sport in the betting ring, etc.. You get some Z-nation too where the surviving tribes use zombies as guard dogs, tied up on chains.. You get some Star Wars with their advanced flying machines.. Oh, and some Daywalkers with the harvesting of blood and hanging donors. All that shooting in the end, both helicopters could have easily been shot at and the Dr. could have been killed.. Instead they watch them fly away, then Thomas has the brilliant idea to go after them on foot.. because he is going to take them down..(which leaves it open to a 3rd installment movie).. You really see how much of an Ahole Thomas' character is.. A one man, apparently psychic, maverick with advanced skills and moves (because being abandoned in the elements does that to you).. He spends the entire movie obsessed about the girl, again, only to get betrayed by her. Never mind the remaining survivors barely made it and called any future attempts a suicide mission; evidently Thomas is about to lead them once again. That's one headache I'll skip. Not every novel needs to be made into a movie. This is a prime example.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
223,kevinba99,Better than many have overlooked!!,10,24 November 2015,"I just watched this movie and must say it is just as good as the first part. What people need to understand is this is a three-part trilogy so this is a ""bridging movie"" for the finale which is not due until next year so you cannot expect the storyline in this movie to have a proper ending. I love the action scenes and thought the storyline flowed very well and served to answer a lot of the uncertainties in part one. It is getting way too much slack than it deserves. All the lead characters did a wonderful job with their acting and the direction was also great. I cannot wait for part 3 which will wrapped it all up. I think the quality of this movie will depend a lot on how part 3 turns out so I hope the movie makers will do it justice.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
224,peachtellsyouwhattowatch,The energy founders on the story.,5,18 April 2016,"The same thing happened like in the first movie. If you look at the films individually and not compare them to the books, you get a well made post-apocalyptic teenage-fantasy- adaptation. You can enjoy the first half of the movie if you don't take everything to serious.Like in the first movie you get a lot of running, action, young enthusiasm and energy. The last is actually quite entertaining and underestimated.But both films are simply to long and the story fades away somewhere in the middle. At the end of the movie you are relieved you made it that far. They bombard you with information, emotion and so on. The running gets tiring too. You'll watch it once. You'll like the beginning due to its excitement and then you'll get bored because the story can not hold up the intensity.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
225,landingwiz,"I liked it more than Part 1, but not everybody will...",7,9 September 2015,"OK, so I found Scorch Trials exciting and more complete as a movie.It also had a better cliffhanger in my opinion, because I felt like I needed to watch the next part NOW. Whereas for the ending of Maze Runner, I was like... ""Here we go again???""For sure... part 2 did not have the novelty of part 1, and for that reason alone some people might give a lower score. In fact, this movie felt more like a zombie survival movie with long screen time in darkness, jumpscares and all, so this is another reason some fans of the first part might not like Scorch Trials. It has a darker atmosphere.It also has many cliché moments, and scenes taken right out from other movies like Jurassic park. Unoriginal ideas, but well, they worked OK in this movie.As for the acting, I liked it. I thought everyone did a pretty compelling job. I liked the twist at the end, which unlike in many movies, doesn't feel forced.All in all, Scorch Trials is a very different movie from the first. Different settings, different environment, different atmosphere. Once again, it did not have the novelty and originality the first part had.But with that said, I can't say it wasn't exciting and entertaining, and made me look forward to the next part.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
226,madison-singfiel,"So, so, so wrong",2,2 February 2018,"For a long time I didn't want to read the books but I did watch the movies. At that time I thought this movie was amazing and then I read the book. Oh my word, I love this cast because they are pretty freaking awesome, but they really, really, really went off book. I mean the main plot is the same however 99/100 things that happened in this movie are incorrect. If this is your first time seeing it and you haven't read the book just assume that everything you're watching is incorrect, because it probably is. The Cranks are overdramatized, the whole rebel gang in the desert thing NEVER HAPPENED and Teresa was pretty much NEVER there. And Rat Man, whom I love, doesn't look like Rat Man!!!!!! Plus the whole ""their blood is the cure"" thing is sooo incorrect, because the Flare infects your brain like cancer or a mental illness, which then has residual effects on the body. So to take their blood would do nothing to fight the Flare. On the other hand the movie is entertaining to watch, if you are not watching it for the story. Therefore I would give it a 7 based on how entertaining it was and a 2 for how inaccurate it was. I do have to say that based on this movie I don't think the next one, the Death Cure, is even worth seeing. If this one was so inaccurate the Death Cure will most likely be much, much worse.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
227,liberationz,Potential but disappointing,6,19 September 2015,"Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, the next installment of the Maze Runner series. Coming just a year after the first one, I had high hopes for this movie as I really enjoyed the first one. So it was a shame to me after seeing this movie I was straight up disappointed. For the first 30 to 40 minutes I was having a good time. After that it turned into a completely different movie, pace was, I was confused with the story, and I was not interested in the characters. That is what made the first one really fun for me, I cared about these characters and I was rooting for them. My biggest complaint about this movie is, it felt like the writers of this movie gave up. I found the script to be lack luster and bland. However, I did enjoy the chase scenes with the scorch zombies, and the effects did not let me down. The cinematography was good, and they portrayed this barren wasteland really well. I thought Dylan O'Brien did a good job in this movie, but overall it was a disappointed for me in the end. For fans of the book series however this movie might be a blast, but for someone who hasn't read the books, this film makes you scratch your head at times.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

If you're contemplating whether or not you should watch it, do yourself a favor and watch it, believe me you will not regret it! I cannot wait until the sequel comes out! Great stuff!

Add to that the more characters this film introduces with more gender and race diversity.The main pro and con of the sequel are its action and structure of the story. First, there is more action in this film than the first one and that makes the film more entertaining as it keeps the viewers invested in it. However, development of story will leave some viewers confused and fans unsettle as it feels like it's going from one place to another with few explanations.(Maybe gearing up for the last installment?)Overall the M.R: Scorch Trials with its' pros and cons is worth a watch from fans and non fans alike.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

We were literally counting down the days on my phone till it came out at the cinema. When it finally did me and my friends went to see it straight away but afterwards I think I was extremely disappointed with it.

Secondly they run super fast for being zombies. They, as far as I can tell, do not tie in what the maze has to do with anything. The movie has good action scenes and thus the reason for my 5 stars. If you just want to watch and have mindless entertainment, then it's good. If you try to make sense out of it, then it's bad. I thought the acting was pretty good though. The movie has some potential it just seems they tried to add too many different things, or condense a lot of material into two hours of film.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
233,jatigre1,Awesome movie that scared the audience so much into not liking it,9,28 November 2015,"For as long as I can remember I've been having these nightmares that I'm being chased by some ""things"" or ""someone"", and after watching the movie I've had the same nightmare, but this time I woke up and thought: ""oh yeah, it kinda makes sense..."". This in not only a good movie, this is an incredible movie. I just hope the producers don't fall for the same stupidity that lead to the end of the sequel of the last air bender, because of some idiot fan boys that failed to see the adaptation for the screen.Now, back to the reason why so many people didn't get it: The nightmares. If you think of an apocalyptic end for humanity, this movie is as probably as close to reality as it gets, even though it looks science fiction, which in my opinion is why so many people hated it. We don't want to believe that it is possible, but we do it anyway in an almost subconscious level. We think of wars or natural disasters and nothing, I mean nothing compares to what would happen if humanity is stricken by a virus that is 100% lethal, has no cure and is turns the infected victims into walking monsters, and that's too frightening, even for a ""fantasy movie"".And at the core of the movie is humanity itself. It is not enough to fight for the ""greater good"" and choose a side for what is believed to be the ""right side"". Most totalitarian states think they can achieve their goals by any means necessary to find a cure, and the movie shows this very well, and in the end they are no different than the threat of the inevitable annihilation itself.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
234,EvelynFilmFan,"While the pace is high and the action scenes impressive, the storyline is weak and the mystery mediocre",6,3 February 2016,"After Thomas and the other 'Gladers' have survived the Maze and its dangers, they are taken to a gigantic complex with other boys and girls. Every now and then a number of teens is selected to move to a 'better environment'. After the hostile Maze, everyone thinks they are save, but Thomas distrust the whole situation. With help of the boy Aris he finds out they are housed at the mysterious organisation WCKD, who is into some strange business. Thomas and the other familiar character decide to escape. Their quest to safety and answers leads to a grueling journey through the Scorch, a desert with the remains of the city of New York, and other strange figures.The Scorch Trials is the second part in The Maze Runner franchise and adaptation of the novel written by James Dashner. Returning to the sequel is director Wes Ball, who has once again delivered an action-packed sci-fi film, and the complete cast. Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Dexter Darden and Alexander Flores are back in their respectively roles of Thomas, Minho, Teresa, Newt, Frypan and Winston. Unfortunately, the character are quite flat and there aren't any character developments. This is party because the main character Thomas, gets too much screen time compared to the others. Teresa might cause a stir which means an unexpected turn of events, the other members of the original group have little to no input. Luckily, the group is joined by new faces very quickly. A boy in the complex who asks Thomas for his help, is called Aris and is played by Jacob Lofland. Of all people, Aris is there the longest and shares his concerns with Thomas. After their escape the group meet Brenda (Rosa Salazar), Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and a group of resistance fighters. Brenda and Jorge could have been interesting characters if they got more screen time.On the mysterious and questionable side, we meet Janson. He is the one who has the control over the complex and is into some strange affairs. During the first thirty minutes it gets explored what Janson is doing and from that moment it is the group's priority to escape from Janson. Janson is played by the man who many of us know by the name Peter 'Littlefinger' Baelish, the insidious character from TV-series Game of Thrones. In other words Aiden Gillen. With this information, Gillen is perfect for the part of Janson. From the moment we meet him, it's clear Janson is up to something and is definitely not someone you can trust!However, after Thomas and his friends escape we only see Janson from a helicopter screaming orders. It was better and more interesting if this character was more deepened. He looks like a simple follower with no own ideas or opinion and leadership. His big boss is Patricia Clarkson's character Ava Paire, the doctor who did or did not die in the previous film. Paige certainly is an interesting character and has the answers to many questions, unfortunately we see too little of her and if she does enters the picture she is not of great value.The storyline is less strong, and the mystery is also significantly less. Like I mentioned before, the first thirty minutes of the film is the only moment when some questions are answered. The kids in the complex are used for the greater good: extract blood to create a cure and defeat the zombie-virus. However, it is wise to watch The Maze Runner before The Scorch Trials. The mysteries of that film which got answered, are not talked about again, which makes it sometimes vague. All though this only counts for the beginning, since there is not much too guess in this film and there is few new information.After the escape we mainly see the characters run and stay out of Janson's hands. The Scorch looks amazing, you can even see the remains of the Brooklyn Bridge and their first shelter resembles an old and dilapidated warehouse. The trip through the desert is besides an upcoming thunderstorm, less intimidating. The best aspect of the film is the action. The visual effects are amazing and the Cranks, zombies, look pretty scary. There even are a couple of jump scare moments. Moreover, the pace of the film is just like its predecessor quite high. Therefore, the film makes you sit on the edge of your seat and is never boring.To conclude, the second part in The Maze Runner series is very entertaining. The pace of The Scorch Trails is high and therefore the film gets never boring nor will you lose interest. The action scenes are well made and the special effects make the action look even better and more impressive. Unfortunately, these are the film's best assets. The storyline is weaker and the mystery, which was so strong in the first part, is pretty mediocre. There's not much to guess and the film is a lot about running for Janson and the organisation WCKD. Dylan O'Brien's character carries the film and he makes a good impression. However, he gets so much screen time which draws the attention of the other characters, old and new, who are therefore less interesting.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

As the sequel to a film that had quite a lot of flaws and a bad ending, but was entertaining if not an incredible adaption from James Dashner's novel. However it did not stray far from the book. This film decides to remove itself from the book and have tiny elements from the novel and I would normally not say this in a review, but the film fails because of it. Instead of being the nail biting, thrilling, mysterious, ominous and almost surreal at times novel, the film could have been excellent if it didn't try to turn itself into a zombie movie and be all mysterious but it fails. It was pretty entertaining, but there wasn't much there. The last scene seemed obviously tacked on and I would be surprised if it wasn't. I had a fun time with my friends going to see it, but that was because we just had fun as a group. One scene even copied the scene in The Lost World: Jurrassic Park where Sarah was on the glass about to break which would send her plummeting to her death. It tried to make you sad, but you ultimately did not care about the characters. The writing was generic and stupid. Movies should be able to stand on their own, but this film doesn't do anything original nor do the universe it created justice. Or the novels. The best way to experience this movie, is in your imagination reading from the pages of the book.

I guess thats the downfall of making movies from books. You can do nothing on your own, its already written.It starts with freaking zombies! Like, what the hell is that? We are surrounded with zombies on TV and theaters. That was the biggest failure!Also you will notice many mistakes in the movie, they are obvious. The reason for that is that they were trying to re-create old fashion scenes to build up tension. I hope they haven't forgot that it's 2015!The ending.. oh well, thats a completely different story from what you gonna expect. It will totally ""blow"" your mind and you will see something you haven't seen before! Okay, enough sarcasm. Now seriously, the ending couldn't be worse.

Everything that happens in it is random and unrelated to anything from the first movie, and honestly - it is pretty boring and rather predictable. Not sure how it got 6.7 score ,it shouldn't be more than 5 , if you watch it at home it won't even manage to keep you awake.

The book was clearly his own thing, just like the movie is. You do have the same story and characters, they are just dealing with the story in a different way, a way that is probably better when you wanne do it justice in only 2 hours.Before watching it, I think it's important that you watched the first movie or else you'll be completely lost about what exactly is going on. But it's such a roller-coaster. The action is faced-paced and looks very spectacular. There are a few run and fight scenes that are dealt with in such a strong way that it had me jumping up and down in my seat. I can't stress enough by writing how much I enjoyed this movie. And most of that has to do with the incredible cast. The writers were able to put in a few heartfelt moments in there so that we don't lose touch with the human side of it all.

It moves into a completely new direction and introduces a new set of ""monsters"" creating a completely new feel in the same world. It still kept the original ""run to live"" theme as they traveled on. The characters were solid, no terrible acting or wild actions.Cons: CGI of ""monsters"" was mediocre at best. Some plot items are put in to keep them moving/alive.

240,nathaliebazinga,Prepare yourself for a story twist fiesta,10,20 November 2017,"Due to all the bad reviews from people who are obviously bored in life and subjectively gave the movie 1/10, I felt an obligation to write a review and give this movie a 10/10 rating. Honestly, if this teenage trilogy doesn't deserve a good rating, which one does?If you are a person who likes to stay in their comfort zone and refuse to support any type of change, even if it is a good one, this movie ain't gonna be your cup of tea. The movie trilogy is slightly different from the books when it comes to timeline of events. Nonetheless, I've read the books before. I also felt it was necessary that Wes made some changes in the content since some scenes in the book we a little bit cliché, for example, the telepathy part etc. It doesn't change the plot of the story though. The story still makes a lot of sense and people who fail to see what the story is about should definitely try watching the movie one more time. I'm not sure what's there to be confusing or unclear.Other than that, the cast is beyond amazing. It is obvious that not only these young people are great actors, but they're also emotionally invested in this project and very passionate about it, which is quite rare to find in today's cinematography. I salute them for that.CGI is beyond satisfying for us, regular people who make 90% of the viewers and who don't watch movies just because we want to see cool effects but want to see great acting and content too. I'm not interested in discussing the finesse because CGI is not bad at all.Anyway, not to prolong this because it's obvious that I had a great time watching it in the cinema (thrice!)... if you are a fan of dystopian and post-apocalyptic movies, you will definitely love this sequel to bits.It is adventurous, mysterious and exciting to watch every time! I'm looking forward to the third sequel to see what they'll make of it, because in the end, It's not important how you start something, but how you finish it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

242,spamtest,Even Better than the Book,10,25 September 2015,"What a surprise this was! Movie adaptations can be really difficult. Not everything translates well, and so some changes are often necessary. This can disappoint book loyalists, but it's the nature of textual vs visual media. In the case of The Scorch Trials, the deviations made sense, and they really served to make this is a truly good movie. The visuals are stunning, the plot came together with lots of riveting action, and the acting is superb. The cranks are jaw-droppingly awesome and creepy, disturbing in unexpected ways. The whole world described in the book has come to life in this movie.Changes to plot twists and some character actions keep the movie at a fast, exciting pace. None of the changes alter the spirit of the world built in the books, though. The quality put into this movie actually ends up improving upon the book, giving the story even more tension and depth. The kids have solved the primary mystery, and The Scorch Trials has them frantically searching for the answer of what to do next, how to survive.This movie definitely kicks it up a notch from first installment, and the result is excellent. The cliffhanger is more dramatic than in The Maze Runner, and it sets the characters up to answer the urgent question of what now, and why. If the trend of getting bigger and more sweeping continues, The Death Cure should be a stunning finish to the Maze Runner trilogy.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Avoid it, it will be a waste of time...And everything is so poorly explained, that you never really get excited about anything - just more and more locations shifts.... always somewhere new to go....

However, I was pleasantly surprised- this is an action-packed movie, which keeps you on the edge of your seat. There is friendship, loyalty, determination, vengeance, talent for trouble, rebellion, betrayal. Every thing an adventure-loving person will enjoy! Not to mention a great cast, and 3 people from Game Of Thrones series! I find it quite similar to the concept of Hunger Games- set in a post apocalyptic era, with a bunch of kids rebelling against a dominating organization. However, it is not a copy-cat of Hunger Games, it has it's own unique story-line, and that is why it is a great movie! There was nothing I did not like about it! May be the lack of water supply was far-fetched, considering the distance covered by the heroes. Nevertheless, I am definitely looking forward to a sequel!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

How is this a 'Trial' at all? This is a boring and horribly predictable escape film. Also. the Cranks weren't zombie-like for the most part. In fact, they were buy and large still sentient people that lived in somewhat civilized communities, depending on the degree of their infection. I'm pretty sure that the only similarity between the book and the movie is that they used the same names of the characters. That's about it. 'Awful' does not do this movie justice, it was repulsive.

247,davidjjey,Only watch if you're a masochist,1,24 October 2015,"The movie itself is _just_awful. Half the dialog seems to be ""go, just go"". Yeah, really. But my biggest problem with the flick (and books for that matter) is that fact that they're just one big lazy rip-off of every YA post-holocaust survival test story we've ever heard of. It's one thing to do a genre piece - it's another to not even present logical reasons for the 'cool' stuff you want in your story. eg. @ WCKD headquarters (oh they can't be serious with that hyper-obvious name?!): WCKD Scientist 1: ""These teens have the secret to beating the disease"" WCKD Scientist 2: ""Oh cool, let's run some blood tests, check their DNA, maybe do some CAT scans..."" WCKD Scientist 1: ""Naaah, why don't we basically re-create that historic TV show Big Brother, add a dash of 'Survivor', and somehow that will tell us what's so special about these kids!"" WCKD Scientist 2: ""Oh, well, yeah....why didn't I think of that?! It'll certainly give us plenty of opportunity for people who don't ask too many questions about a plot to gaze mindlessly at the screen when we broadcast it....yeah, let's make some money!!""Further to that, this movie has...wait for it.....zombies. Yes, that staple of so many low-grade flicks and TV shows these days, zombies. Could the writer have tried just one iota harder to come up with something original? Apparently not. Final verdict?

248,nickweninger,Solid second film in the series but not amazing by any means,6,18 September 2015,"The Scorch Trials brings a solid second film to the Maze Runner franchise. As we all know, the Maze Runner film has a very similar style of teen fictions as other such movies as The Hunger Games and the Divergent series, so this film will follow in that type and sense of film. Nothing really too unexpected though. However this movie has maybe the most intense of the teen fiction movies, offering up some actually scary parts of the movie that has enjoyable to watch. The visual aspect of this film is very well done and offers all the thrills needed to keep you engaged with the film. The whole movie is basically a chase and then hiding. In that sense it kind of reminded me of the amazing movie Mad Max that came out this year except most everything was on foot and not in apocalypse vehicles. One thing that I noticed is that this movie feels like a completely different movie from the first movie in the series. I mean that in the sense that the Hunger Games and Divergent both seem to follow each other very easily. They lead each other to the next film and have the same type of feel between the films. This movie did not have the feeling. It will feel to you as a completely different movie; a stand alone film. This film also will reveal some things about why things are the way they are but in a frustrating sense. They start to answer a question and then they move away from it. The big reveal seems kind of cliché to me but then again it is teen fiction so what are you going to do. Overall though, this movie was entertaining to watch but is not without its flaws. It is a little over two hrs long so keep that in mind. **Another side note, I have been told and read about that this movie is very different than the book so keep that in mind. The author and director have said that the third movie is going to be much more true to the book.Average Man Score: 6/10",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

After a lot of thinking I decided to start with the word ""Awesome""This movie was much better than I expected. The trailer gave me a bad feeling for this, but the movie did really give me everything I wanted. When I entered the cinema, I did not expect to see jump scares in a 12+ movie. The actors and the sound was everything I could have hoped for. I was really disappointed when I saw the ""zombies"". They were really good, but it gave me too much ""The last of us"" feeling.... There was a lot of scenes that reminded me too much about other films. For example Jurassic Park.after all this I will give the film 7/10 If you like the Mazereunner, zombies and epic fighting scenes, then this is the film for you!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
250,odaat-30737,"Not having read the book versions, cinema-wise 'Scorch' a different but great follow up.",9,30 October 2015,"When we last left off in (2014) 'The Maze Runner', Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) and the remaining clan of youths whom managed to escape the ever evolving maze, were seemingly rescued from an abandoned science laboratory by a band of armed rebels. If you've wondered where exactly the rescued are being flown to by the helicopter at the conclusion of that film, the answer lies in the recently released second installment of the trilogy, 'The Scorch Trials'. Upon landing in an apocalypses world of wasteland and chaotic battle of people, the clan is rushed into an enormous security facility, in which a high tech vault door shuts behind them shielding them from all the dangers of the outside world. Upon meeting, Mr. Janson (Aidan Gillen) whom is the head of the facility, he explains that they are here among many other survivors from similar mazes. The clan's secure feelings of being in a safe haven become short lived when circumstances reveal to Thomas that Mr. Janson is not who he makes himself out to be. Discovering that the clan and all the other youths are being targeted and set up as guinea pigs again for another test due to their immunity to the world-wide virus outside, the clan escapes; only to enter a world almost beyond recognition. Running away in a big city lost in sand and rubble, they also fight for survival from bizarre weather occurrences caused by the solar flare epidemic explained to them in the end of 'The Maze Runner'. They embark on a journey where they must seek to build alliances with apocalypse survivors; however having the shaky task of trying to discern who really is good and who is bad. What I particularly loved most of all in the world that director Wes Ball has created was the exterior settings. Unless I missed it, there has never been mention of how long ago the world's fallout was supposed to have occurred. However; in contrast to many apocalypse themed movies where you find empty damaged cities with freeways with old cars frozen in space on the roads long abandoned, the wastelands here reminds me of the ancient ruins you'd find of Rome. Freeway overpasses are only half in place, skyscrapers look like building skeletons, and tall bridges are sunken into tower high piles of sand. While I've always got the vibe that since film number 1 that the fallout occurred as long as a century ago, the visuals seems to suggest of what America might look like thousands of years from now if it were to fall. Like many science fiction movies that are made for entertainment but also has undertone spiritual or political themes that not everyone may catch onto, for me, 'The Scorch Trials' seemed to have some themes that are relevant in today's society. I will restrain myself from pacifically declaring what theme that would be since I believe it would clue off too much of a spoiler about plot, but for the time being, think about that old rationalizations philosophy by some people who believe the bad things must be done for the greater good. While there are many eerie far-fetched things that you will experience in seeing what happens to humans inflicted with the solar flare virus, Ava Paige (Patricia Clarkson) whom works amongst scientists, brings to surface something that could be seen as a plausible scenario in the far future of America. I believe that what this character wants to do in this story, echoes an issues that you will find in today's media in a much smaller scale. Along with the already great established cast, two interesting new actors show up in portraying both the antagonist and uncertain antagonist. Probably best known for the slick, charming manipulative character, Littlefinger in HBO's current hit, 'Games of Thrones', Aidan Gillen nicely plays one of the head men from the lab who puts on two faces. Then there is Giancarlo Esposito whose been playing projected bad guys in TV over the last several years: such as the rebel and militant Tom Neville in (2012-2014) 'Revolution', the iconic double personality Gus Fring in seasons 2- 4 in AMC's, (2008-2013) 'Breaking Bad', and even time to time appears in ABC as Sidney Glass/Magic Mirror in (2011- ) 'Once Upon a Time'. Here Esposito plays a personality who wrestles between antagonist and protagonist as an ally of the youth clan. If you are like me whose been waiting to see this film until the last minute, now would be the time to see it; as it is now appearing to me that the lifespan torch of 'The Scorch Trials) is about to get snubbed out in the town I live in. Personally, I enjoyed the first 'Maze Runner' a little bit more than this new installment probably because the maze was such a mystical place of mystery. However; I did at the same time find it just as enjoyable.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Perhaps I didn't read the book so I do not understand, but the whole film could have been cut in half to avoid a lot of extraneous stuff. Action sequences were decent. Jump-scares were decent. Overall plot was alright, although it feels like the whole film was overly stretched out (a la Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies). There was also not much character chemistry to carry the story.

Not much what is happening is explained. What bothers me the most though is the 'performance' of Dylan O'Brian. If you watched anything else with him in it, you would realize he plays exact same character in every single movie. I know he is not the only actor who does this, but it make you think if it's really an acting or if he is just being himself or learn to act only 1 way altogether...

254,timothylyes,A review from the perspective of someone who hasn't read the books,6,17 November 2015,"I've seen a lot of criticism of this movie for not following the original book plot line. Personally, I have not read the books, but typically I am of the opinion you should stick to the books wherever possible - you look at all good book adaptations and this is nearly always the case. Nevertheless I will defer to those who have actually read the book for a more informed opinion from that perspective.So anyway, from a more outsider perspective to the fandom, the movie was decent for what it is. I enjoyed the maze aspect of the first movie a lot more than this one - the maze was perhaps a somewhat more novel approach to a post-apocalyptic world than the usual. Unfortunately the sequel reverts back to the standard deserts, zombies and military vehicles we're all used to. It wouldn't have been my first choice in direction, but I digress. I came into the movie expecting action and thrills, and it does deliver on that, however generic those thrills may be. So I can't really complain.The storyline and plot development was haphazard at best. After being apparently rescued at the end of the first movie, I would've thought we'd have a bit of time to get our bearings and at least have some kind of explanation on what's going on. You get none of that. Ten minutes in and the team is off running again; it's like a habit they picked up in the first movie and can't kick. Nobody knows where to run either, it's always just in the opposite direction to whatever is chasing them, be it guns, zombies or lightning strikes. At least our friends have had some good practice.Speaking of which, just like the viewer, our protagonists don't seem to have a clue what is going on either - the sheer number of times Thomas gets asked ""so what's the plan"" ""so where are we going"" ""what's going to happen now"" is honestly borderline irritating. Newt's character is even more useless than ever - I think almost line he has basically amounts to ""we can't do this""...which you'd think would be a great contrast to Thomas' ""point me in a random direction and watch me run"" persona, but in reality it just made Newt's character a bit of a dullard. The only real character development the movie had was Brenda's character. In fact most other characters introduced in this film (including the normally dominant presence of Giancarlo Esposito) were rather forgettable. I knew Aiden Gillen's character was a bad guy after about 5 seconds screen time and that's all you ever learn about him. I don't even remember the kid's name who was crawling around in the air vents and was pleasantly surprised when, after about an hour, he once again popped into existence just long enough to get our friends out of another jam before disappearing from our memory forever. We also learned nothing new about our maze survivors, beyond Teresa being a bit more drippy than usual. In general I would say the performance of the actors/actresses was pretty good considering the weak script they had to work with. Bonus points for the short but wacky antics of Alan Tudyk - there is never a dull moment when that man is on screen.In summary, if you're looking for a decent action flick you can watch without thinking too much or getting too invested in the characters, this movie is a great choice. If you're expecting something more than that, you might be disappointed. At the end of the day I got what I came for with this film, and am looking forward to the conclusion of the trilogy.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
255,dylanr2015,They turned a Good movie into a Walking Dead + Hunger Games knockoff.,3,22 September 2015,"The first Maze Runner movie I really enjoyed watching and would watch again. This movie did a complete 180 though and just destroyed the series. Instead of taking the good and improving on the first one, this movies is basically just hunger games, trying to get away from the bad guys just to get caught type of stuff, and hunger games, these infected human/zombie like creatures chasing people around. Normally I'd still give a movie a chance but I just couldn't. One main reason is the CGI for this movie, it was just laughable. CGI was used for all of the infected characters chasing the main group around and it just looked like CG from movies and video games from 5 years ago, just terrible. They go so far from the book plot line it's ridiculous too. If you want to see it wait until it comes out to online rental or redbox or video store. It's not worth paying to see in theaters. Also warning to adults taking kids, this movie is closer to an R rating than a PG-13, it's a really far stretch that they made it only PG-13.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
256,vanbane,"Spoiler Alert: Beautiful and very thrilling, believable but... why is Rosa Salazar/Brenda not in the cast list?!",8,20 November 2015,"Beautiful and very thrilling, believable but... why is Rosa Salazar/Brenda not in the cast list?! I don't get it, Brenda is a main character late on but doesn't even show up in IMDb's expanded cast list, what the heck kind of oversight is this and no one tries to correct it?!I also find it not believable that the teens have never encountered zombies, how so, and how in the world do they not refer to them as zombies? If that term is going to magically drop out of the terminology of the world that they might as well be speaking some other language, or I expect it to be revealed that this is taking place on an alternate Earth.The zombies were also too fake in my view, acted too cliché. It was also nonsensical to me how they were ""full term"" in this sewer system and yet full term was simply some nonsensical existence as... root people, so to speak.Also, Brenda... was she supposed to represent somehow the LGBT crowd, like to appease that minority part of the culture, because she looked so boyish and like a so called ""dike"". I don't understand why the director used her for a romance scene because she is not an attractive girl and her star rating on IMDb shows that. Why didn't they use someone attractive, that would have been compelling. The same thing with ""Theresa"", why use a drab plain looking girl to be the romantic attraction for the lead guy? Stupid stupid choice, they should have at least made her some sorta person with a make-up compulsion so that she looked pretty throughout the movie due to some OCD make-up habit, like hiding on her self a make up kit all the time or even ""up there"" if you know what I mean.Also there was something I found disturbing in the movie, that being Newt's comment that they could ""assume"" not everyone in their group was immune to being a zombie because one guy got infected. That word ""assume"" is wrong in the context, assume means just that, it has nothing to do with WHAT IS EVIDENT, it's a cliché that people with narcissistic personality disorder use and to the hurt of the world because it confuses logical thinking. You should never assume anything, and this movie in a way makes things worse for the world culture because not only is assuming being put in a good light but it's being confused with a comment that makes it out to be something based on what is evident!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

260,apgraybill,Didn't they learn anything from Eragon!?,4,29 December 2015,"Let's review this basic fact: Eragon was an amazing book series that didn't make it past the first movie. Why? BECAUSE Hollywood PULLED A Hollywood AND CHANGED THE MAJORITY OF THE STORY. And they did it again with this movie.Don't get me wrong, the first movie was extremely good...but I think I say that because I saw the movie first. I read the book after and was pretty disappointed with what was missing from the movie but still love the movie. I was dying to see this one and heard bad things from friends so I waited for it to come out on DVD and was still mad I paid the $1 for the hapless mess that I witnessed. My husband thought it was okay, but I was silently seething at how much they changed the movie. They literally RUINED it! In the first they just omitted a couple (MAJOR) key points and changed a couple bits up, but this one they basically skimmed through the book and, like Eragon, changed almost everything. The thing I'm most angry about, however, is they left out my absolute favorite scene from the book. In the book, during their ""escape"" from WCKD, the gang enters a completely pitch black room and bump into things and...well I won't give away what happens but it would have been absolutely perfect for the movie and THEY WENT AND Hollywood IT. Why, WHY WHY WHY do directors/writers think this is okay?! The drugs and whores they all surround themselves with must be getting to them.

This movie was definitely more mature than the first one. The themes can be downright disturbing, such as the harvesting of the kids bodies for their blood while they are still alive. That's messed up. One character is infected and chooses to shoot himself. The zombies were very gruesome, especially in the scene in the sewers in the city.This is definitely an action-focused movie. The action sequences are OK, but are plagued with shaky-cam.

262,moviefanatic-74654,I just watched The Maze Runner?,3,28 September 2015,"First of all, I would like to state that despite reading the book, I have never seen the original film. However one of the few things that this movie does well is provide ways to be able to pick up where they left off and have newcomers know what is happening. The problem with this movie is that it is all over the place. It doesn't know what it wants to be. A good portion of the film is a zombie horror movie. 20 minutes later it's a romance movie and then it's an action movie, so on and so forth. The plot doesn't move forward much, especially since the runners are in the Scorch 20 minutes into the film. They are constantly introducing new characters and ask us to care for them even though we've just met them. It had the same problem with Quicksilver from Avengers. When he died, nobody cared. When Brenda starts talking about her brothers tragic story with Thomas, it is hard to care due to the fact that this is a new character. There is barely any character development and that can be a major problem for movies. By the end of the movie, it's basically a worse version of The Hunger Games. The directing was like a mix of J.J. Abrams and Zack Snyder and that isn't a mix that should ever happen. The DOP must have seen The Hunger Games and said, ""I LIKE THAT!"" and went with it. I don't think there is ever a shot where you actually see the zombies or the action that is going on. By the end, there are so many points where the movie should have ended, but just kept on going. You feel like you've been watching for hours upon hours by the time it ends. Plot holes shine throughout the entire movie. How did those two kids get into the Scorch and let the rest in? That's just one of the many questions you are scratching your head over through the movie. Continuity is a problem as well. There are just a few shining lights in this movie. Despite the lazy and cheesy script, the acting does stand out, even on the kid actors side. Giancarlo Esposito is always great and Alan Tudyk (though his 5 minutes of screen time did nothing and made NO sense) did great as this deadbeat club owner. The action sequences ended up being pretty cool and somewhat entertaining to watch.A movie that makes me want to see it redone as a Zack Snyder R-rated gore fest is not necessarily a good thing.Overall, if you're a fan of the book you might as well see the film. But if you're just going to see it as a movie, spend your money on Black Mass or save it for The Martian.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
263,sammyxander,An Evening with Thomas,2,24 November 2015,"I invited Thomas over to my house to hang out. He showed up on-time which impressed me a bit as we were just going to chill and nothing more. I asked him if he would love some tea to which he replied 'yes'. While I was in the kitchen preparing tea for both of us, I heard his phone ring; I knew it was his because I was with my phone and the ringtone was different.The silence that followed was odd as I expected him to be engaged in a conversation. 'Maybe, it was a missed call..' I thought. 'BANG, BANG, CRASH' I almost jumped out of my skin. I ran to the sitting room to see what could have caused the ruckus. The sight that greeted me was one I would never forget. My entire shelf lay in bits and pieces strewn across the center rug; two gaping holes that seemed to have been made by punches stood just above where the shelf used to stand. The wall pictures that once hung on these spots where in the pile of broken mess on the floor..'I'm sorry', Thomas's apology seemed to bring my attention to him. He apparently had been looking through the wreckage and was now standing in front of my Samsung smart TV.. 'I'm sorry' he said again and I assumed (rather hopefully) that he was about to give me a plausible reason for all this commotion.. He continued, ' This is how they got me' and in a flash he smashed my TV hard on the floor. 'WTH!!!' this couldn't be happening.. I was across the room in no time and found myself jerking Tom quite aggressively but at the same time kindly inquiring what this madness was about.. He cried, 'they have found me , they have found me and this means you are in trouble.. its not safe here.. we gotta run'. I requested, 'who has found you Thomas? I do not understand what you mean..' as I desperately sought for answers. Thomas flared,' I don't know but what I do know is that we are not safe.. we have got to leave now'. Out of the corner of my eye I saw his phone in a pile of stuff where he apparently tried to destroy it. I made a move for it. He must have noticed because he jumped on my back and we got involved in a squabble. He obviously wanted to permanently destroy it and I was adamant about finding the root cause of the problem. We only succeeded in pushing the phone further and further away in our vain attempts to reach it..I had had just about enough and was about to go full-on beast-mode on Tommy when his ring-tone interrupted. The distraction was enough for him to break free of my grip and grab the phone off the floor. He made a gesture to smash the phone again and I shouted, almost begging, that he at least answer the call, 'If they already know where you are, you might as well find out what they want..' My reasoning seemed to appeal to him as he proceeded to speak with the caller. I could only hear Tommy's end of the conversation which was mostly one-word responses confirming his identity. I then noticed his shoulders sag and his breathing steady as one would when heavy tension has been lifted. 'Oh OK.. Thanks man.. I'm really grateful', then he ended the call.The look of guilt and shame on his face was overwhelming but a part of him still looked like he hadn't had his fill yet.. 'That was from the hotel manager.. I forgot my wallet at the counter when I stopped to leave some instructions with the front desk agent. I'm so sorr.....' I smashed his jaw in with a clean left hook which sent him crashing into the mess he had made then I went to the kitchen to have some tea.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I watched the first movie, and though it was different than the book, I didn't mind the differences. Though confusing, it wasn't too bad. THIS movie, however, is a TERRIBLE adaptation. Not only did the writers/director change virtually everything about the book, they also created a storyline that was incoherent and poorly conceived. I had so looked forward to seeing this movie, and there is very little I can say that is good about the movie. Sure, the special effects are cool, and that is about it. Some of the acting isn't terrible, but they were given such a bad script, that it's not the actors faults. By the middle of the movie, I couldn't have even told you what part of the book they were even in. I'm so glad that I didn't waste money to go to the theaters to watch this!

But the screenplay... So different from the book and I usually like when there's a minimum of similarities. I just don't get why they changed it. It was a good formula; WICKED sends them in the Scorch, Jorge and Brenda appears no longer after, and finally, the encounter with the girls. I felt like seeing a whole new movie, but only with the book's main characters. I also think the relation between Brenda and Thomas was not enough clear. It is crystal clear in the book that she feels something for him and we know it, but the scene in the movie went so fast that we later realize that she liked him.

274,tahlia-vanboxtel,Utter disappointment,2,10 October 2015,"Firstly, I would like to say, The Maze Runner series is arguably one of my most favorite book series, full of suspense and shocking developments and also full of insight unto how far people would go in dire circumstances. The books keep you on the edge of your seat, constantly surprising you with plot twists and turns that keep you guessing. The Maze Runner movies, on their own are excellent, tense and filled with pretty cool graphics, HOWEVER, the only things about these movies that are the same with the books are the characters, and even they are pretty loosely based on the ones in the books... On second thought, I'm going to change that last sentence, and swap it with this: the only thing similar with the books and movies are the characters NAMES, and, technically the movies have that wrong as well, and can I please point out that they can't even spell ""wicked"" right? Within the first 10 minutes of this movie, they managed to create an entirely different story to the one I love so much in the book. I have seen my fair share of book to film adaptations, therefore this definitely carries some weight when I say that I have never seen a series ruined so badly, even killing people that are supposed to make it through the whole series? You people make me sick Now that that little rant is over I will give you some advice: To the people who have not and do not plan on reading the books and would like to watch an action packed zombie movie for the younger generation, then you will love this. To my fellow book lovers who enjoyed the same twists and entertainment that I did in this epic book series - do not bother! Read the books again, trust me! Thanks for reading my rant :-)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

This one, however, is not. In fact if you miss the first 5 minutes would not think this was a sequel at all but just some generic future apocalypse horror.Having escaped the maze in the first film the runners spend more than 2 hours getting precisely nowhere. There is no story, only running about in a CGI world taken straight out of Bethesda's fallout games. However at least in a computer game you can interact with the world; in this film you are stuck in an anxiety dream you can't escape from, forever pursued and unable to get away from the bad people who want to kill you. The plot twists are lame, for instance the group at one point get separated because a person, who was specifically asked to prepare for departure has to go back for a trinket she apparently forgot to collect earlier. I wrote better plots (and was chastised for them by my English teacher) when I was 11.The characters one dimensional, spending most of their time ""caught in the headlamps"" staring at stuff when they should be running. The dialog is painful; I'm used to those ubiquitous words ""Hang On"" being used in almost every film, but this film is just full of such stuff. Having said all of the above, the cinematography is pretty good and full marks for the type casting of ""Baelish"" (Aidan Gillen), an actor I never tire of.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I'm not sure which one is worse: a bad movie or a bad rate.The story of the movie is so simple, it's very hard to keep sitting on the chair in the first half of the movie. It's basically a challenge to do that on the 2nd half. There's no surprise in the story to anyone has average IQ, everything is so estimate-able.The characters are blanks. I mean after the movie is finished, I challenge people to name all the main characters of the movie and see how many can do that.The music is not detectable, I mean maybe they played something, didn't leave a trail after it's finished.And there's not much scene to be memorized.

It became one of my favourite books of all time and i could not wait for the film to begin production! That was my first mistake. This film basically had nothing to do with the novel. ""SPOILERS"" the first thing I said to my self was "" why the heck is Teresa not split up with the other group?!"" In the book Teresa gets split up and joins the girls group. The two groups fight over the scorch while Teresa used her telepathic powers to talk to Thomas about warnings. THIS FILM DOES NOT INCLUDE THE TELEPATHIC CONVERSATIONS! Why?!?!? The movie pretty much missed out some of the best parts out of the book, however it is also included some of the best parts. There fore , for someone who has read the book i would not recommend this film... HOWEVER...Part two of my review talks about the point of view for people who have never read the books. I would definitely recommend this film if that is the case. All though i complained in my first part of my review, this film was actually fantastic if you ignore the books! The book and the film are different from each other and I loved both of them for different reasons. To me the main thing that made this film have a big impact was the music and the intense ending. With out spoiling anything, the fill was just well done. I could not state any more simpler, forgetting the novels, this film would of been Fantastic!So in conclusion, if you have read the books like me, then just a heads up, you will be disappointed, however if you have not read the books, i guarantee this film will be great! Either way, the film was excellent and I recommend it! Just not over keen on the novel to big screen adaption...",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

This movie has taken the book that you love and change it into a mainstream zombie survival movie.When I first watch The Maze Runner, I really like it because even though they did change some stuff, they're at least stick to the storyline and have most of the plot.So when I heard that The Scorch Trial movie just comes out, I expect it to be as great, or even better than than the first movie. Which turns out to be a great disappointment and makes me leave the cinema feeling angry and disappointed.They really change the storyline and twisted the plot. For a starter, The Scorch Trial supposed to be another trial from WICKED. And they change it into an escape with WICKED hunts them and try to get them to get back to WICKED which is supposed to be the part of The Death Cure.Seriously, what's happen to the silvery liquid who eats people head and turn it into a ball, an epic journey across the scorch and the betrayal scenario?We understand that it's kind of hard to make a movie that is exactly like the book, but if you're going to make a movie adaptation from a book, at least follow the book plot.

The young actors don't really seem up to the challenge of delivering an on screen presence; but they're not given much opportunity - their lines are boring; they are all so reactive. I lost count of the number of times Thomas yells something like 'Go!'

This disgrace revolves around a century old stupid idea that ""young are exploited by old"" - YES ! you got it right ... all old of the world are bad guys trying to extract ""magic juice"" for young blood just to postpone inevitable. (hmmmm tank girl comes to mind)spoiler alert !!!So yeah - younger you are, the more likely you are to be immune to some ""magic disease"". All old people are part of suppression machinery that is put in place to harvest an ""immunity gene"" from youngsters blood until a cure is found. There is a pretty obvious tone made that all old are not bothered to find the cure, they just want to survive.And by the way, this movie is such a leap forward in cinematography !!! it's not a black kid that gets killed off ... it's the paki !!!

What's wrong with you guys ??? some decades ago everybody wanted to be you and after Rambo 2 everybody started hating you !!! Se any pattern ??? It's got awe full insulting cinema that you continue to make is making people wonder are you at sound mind !!!

I had read the book beforehand and was already a big fan but the movie version took it to a whole new level. It followed on perfectly from the first movie and gave plenty more background for the main characters. It also introduced several new characters who were all interesting and made you empathize with them even after just a short time on screen. There were plenty of twists in the plot to keep you guessing as to what was going to happen. And the Cranks were also brilliant.

I am actually not sure which one is better.There's a lot of changes for sure, but I consider it to be a positive thing since you get two awesome things, not only one.Great effects, great cast. A good sense of humor and some high class action. It's like 10 genres combined in one film. Not suitable for children though, in my opinion. The guy, 25+ years old, that was sitting next to me was scared as hell. Cranks do look somewhat scarier then the walkers in TWD, and are faster and more aggressive.Comparing to the first film, you can imagine The Maze Runner being a toddler, and The scorch trials being an adult.

286,dan6288,Back to the same YA adaption you've seen before....,5,20 September 2015,"While the first Mazerunner set itself away from the pack of YA Dystopian future film adaptations, Scorch Trials jumps on the bandwagon.I even got them all confused at one point. Isn't there a 'scorch' and a 'wall' that prevents those why-are-we-so-dangerous Divergents from crossing the void? Isn't there a great dictator and our 'only hope' youngling who vows to 'kill' him/her in Hunger Games? Isn't there a group of important-but-we-don't-really-know-why kids running around in Kanye West's latest fashion line in both of those films? The first Mazerunner kept the mystery, pace, energy, and most importantly action, all at such a great length and mood of importance, that it was hard not to like. Scorch Trials tries to keep that energy, but this time around it feels forced and misdirected.Not to mention the run-time that is completely unnecessary. Like 'Mad Max' the plot is thin. They escape, they run, they escape again, run some more, a little bit more escaping, they run again, they escape once more, and end the film with.... we have to go back and 'finish' this.Finish what?! What is so damn important?! We don't know because the whole film works like a long filler episode of television. Just as two characters are about to reveal hidden memories to one another or answer important plot questions, they stop! I find that to be unbearable and annoying (especially since it occurs several times from beginning to end.)You never have a single conversation end in this film. It's all hints, hints... nothing.And once the film ends, it ends with two lines that make no sense. ""I'm going to kill her."" Why? Does that stop WKD? Nope. Then a response. ""What is your plan?"" --as our hero responds with a look out in the distance-- we cut to black..... because you don't have a f*cking plan. Because none of you have a f*cking plan. There is a constant mood in this film, and the Divergent films, and the Hunger Games, that something is important, some kind of a minuscule idea is important, but we're gonna take 8 films to kinda-sorta find out what that important thing is.Consensus? I now consider the first Mazerunner a great film that'll have to stand on its own. Skip Scorch, or wait for DVD. The good things? One or two moments of action (not scenes) that are well done. And in general the scope, set pieces, and CGI are top notch.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Instead i got something completely different. What i got was a story that someone else wrote, almost not a single happening according to the original story. A few brief happenings was recognisable, but almost the entire movie was something new. The movie in itself wasn't all that bad, but please, don't relate it to the Maze Runner books...

After watching the first movie i was not amazed, but the movie had some nice mysteries which had me wondering about a lot of things. Why did this and that happen? Who are Wicked and why do they do it? I expected some of these questions to be answered in this sequel, but oh how wrong i was. It's an action packed movie with a bunch of teenagers running all the time and amazingly getting away every single time. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is hardly any actual story or meaning in this sequel. Just an endless game of running. The clichés are annoying as well.

All in all a waste of time as one might as well just skip this one and watch the next because nothing happens. All the questions i wanted answered were just altered a bit because of some useless information received in the film. A clear problem that they are so keen to make a third movie and making people interested in it, so they forgot that this movie needed to be able to stand alone and entertain.

291,luke18032000,If you've read the book then don't bother,3,11 September 2015,"This film is awful. It goes completely against the book and makes me angry to watch. I have never seen a more inaccurate film adaptation. For a start it wasn't even a trial. Thee escape from book 3 happens in the second film and wicked spend the time hunting them down. In addition, half of the characters aren't developed and newt isn't diagnosed with the flare. The film is boring and downright scattered. Oh look mountains lets go there to meet with the right arm. For the record, this happens in book 3. The only positive was good action sequences but even these couldn't make up for the absolute plot holes and now I am left wondering what is left to tell in film 3",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
292,do-arellano-mayra,More entertaining than the first installment,8,10 September 2015,"Let's get this straight out of the way. If you are tired of movies based on books that present a young cast, you won't find something here to convert you. However if you found the first movie to be a surprisingly entertaining, solid action flick;or if you don't mind the age of the main characters as long as the story deliveries, there's plenty to like here. Specially because there are some improvements over the flaws of the first film.The action sequences are gripping, well directed and have a feel of raw realism. It's evident that the ensemble of actors- young or mature- gave it all physically. It seems as though the stunts doubles had little to do in comparison to the average action flick.If in the first movie you got 2 or 3 action scenes to keep you in the edge of your seat,in The scorch trials you'll find action almost from the beginning.I'm not a fan of non-stop action, but I was particularly impressed with Barry Pepper who I heard filmed his action scenes with a broken ankle. The acting is extremely good. Not only the young lead Dylan O'Brien and his young co-stars, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario, Rosa Salazar and Thomas Brodie Sangter, deliver strong performances, but also the supporting cast of mature actors. By the way if you have read or heard that the very talented supporting cast of mature actors is there only for their paychecks or that ""they have better things to do"" you are hearing a biased opinion by unprofessional reviewers who are tired of ""YA adaptations"". But just because some reviewers are tired of this ""subgenre"" doesn't mean that plenty of talented cast and crews aren't fully involved with these kind of stories in spite of the studios greedy intentions. This movie might not be perfect, might not be for everyone but one thing that you can tell for sure is that Barry Pepper, Alan Tudik, Aidan Gillen, Lily Taylor, Patricia Clarkson and particularly Giancarlo Esposito gave it all. They have amazing chemistry with the very talented young cast and they seem to be screaming ""100% commitment to my role"". It became clear to me through their committed performances that they believed in the project and that they trust the director Wes Ball. There's plenty of character development opportunities and these mature actors take advantage of them all even if their screen time is limited. Ava Paige as played by Patricia Clarkson started the movie as the archetypal ""evil scientist"" and by the end of the movie I was somehow rooting for her. She really needs to find a cure to this mysterious disease called ""the flare"". Giancarlo Esposito started limited by a role that seemed at first written to fulfill a quota of the typical ""evil adult vs. innocent kid"" trope. However, as the movie moves on we discover that he is far from being a cartnoonish ""evil adult"" and that his character is full of humanity. A scene in which he is concerned over his protegé was one of my favorites of a film from which I was only expecting mindless entertainment and non-stopping action.The problem is that this brilliant cast was limited by a script that seemed to go nowhere. I'd say the script is not as strong as the one of the first movie and that script wasn't particularly good to begin with. There are some improvements. This time some clichéd lines have gone away, there's more backbone to the characters and a little more of ""showing-not-telling"". But if you are thinking that everything that didn't make sense in the first one will make sense in this movie you might end up disappointed.One more time the movie ends in a cliffhanger although this time there's not a last minute info-dump. If you don't mind these minor flaws on the script you might end up enjoying the ride.In my opinion, the strongest part of the movie, besides the thrilling action and good acting are the visuals. I enjoyed the shots of the scorch because the cinematographer took plenty of risks. I want to see the movie again just to appreciate these shots better. There were also interesting shots in terms of composition.The VFX is extremely well executed. I thought the director was going to get overboard with the CGI usage but he wisely balanced the visual effects with the emotional arc to take the audience to a journey through this devastated lands in which under each nook, each skeleton building lies a new danger, a new story, a new world which I'd love to explore. As if this wasn't enough to make me want to see the movie again, Joe Paesano's score (Daredevil TV series, The maze runner) was masterfully used and added a special feeling to the already beautiful visuals. Mark my words, Paesano's scores will get him an Oscar somewhere in the near future.The scorch trials has everything to become a huge international box office success because is a solid, yet imperfect second chapter, that will keep audiences entertained and screaming for chapter 3.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
293,oskar-mellblom98,Not so a-maze-ing,5,24 September 2015,"I really enjoyed watching the first Maze Runner but I didn't think this was quite as good.The Scorch Trials got some great and intense, action packed scenes, good acting and cool environments but that's it. If you liked the first movie you may like this too or you may get a little disappointed. Don't have so high hopes on this movie.I still enjoyed it a bit but I think it got many bad parts.I'm not a fan of zombies so I hated the Idea with zombies in the desert or (infected people with a virus, Cranks). Everything is about Thomas in this movie. Everyone knows him and he does not know them. He does not even want to know who they are. That's so weird. I got tired of everyone calling his name. It felt like there was never a scene without Thomas in it. I think the most irritating part is that Thomas and the others do everything they can to escape from the ""WICKED"", they go out in the scorch and some of them dies. Later on one friend of his is getting caught by the WICKED again and Thomas decides that he will turn around. They barely even made it out from the scorch and now they turn back after 2hours of the film because one friend got caught? (also because he realized he wants to fight the WICKED now and not run away anymore). It felt like a meaningless adventure. I think they could just skip to the 3rd movie right away.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
294,justloginme,Yet another Zombie Movie,5,17 December 2015,I have never read any of the books and this is just review from a movie viewer. This is a huge let down from the first part. The first part sets things up nicely and the second part was all set to fire the sparks I hoped and it turned out to be a zombie movie with some nice parallel background storyline which is what I thought this movie is going to be (I am not buying technically its not a Zombie crap). This movie has portrayed a scorched earth quite well and should have toned down the zombie part but hey probably thats what the book says which I don't care and gets 5/10. I wish there would be more to it in the 3rd part than the never ending Resident Evil type movies.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

296,khizarhayatfb,I do not think this review is true to what the film is all about.,10,22 December 2015,"My opinion about this review about Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials is that his review is totally one-sided and bitterly biased against the film. The most important point I would like to make here about this review is that it is misleading for the viewers who have not yet watched the film. I am not going to talk about the film here because I have decided to give a brief review of the film separately. I just want to express my shock at this untrue review of the film. I think the film is good enough to entertain and create curiosity whereas this reviewer thinks completely the otherwise. There are always things about a film which one would feel needed improvement, but the way this reviewer has run this film down with very negative comments, I think this is simply not fair.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
297,bbielski-58412,Completely and awfully excellent,9,30 September 2015,"The Scorch Trials was a very intriguing movie. Why? Because the actors made their characters and emotions believable. The original group that escaped the glade together with Thomas (Dylan O'brien), their loyalty was questioned when Teresa (Kaya Scodelario) decided to turn against the group and stand with W.I.C.K.D, the enemy that killed many kids or stuck them up in the maze forcing them to face evil spider like robots. I must say that Dylan O'brien did a fantastic job portraying the character Thomas when running for his life and saving his group members from the people who were infected. This movie was suspenseful and made me jump when scary zombies popped up on the screen. I still can't get over the fact that Teresa called W.I.C.K.D when the group did not expect it, even after Thomas continuously saves her and makes sure she never gets left behind. I felt the betrayal and tension through the screen. This only makes me want to see more and I absolutely cannot wait for the next one. I have to find out how Thomas plans on killing W.I.C.K.D and if he succeeds. I also would like to know what the Wicked organization is up to. I know they are trying to find a cure, but why must everything be so secretive. I hope the third one brings light to questions I have and I hope it is just as good or even better.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

This film contains much more action than the first film and it gives us more of an insight into the demonic mind of DR PAIGE!One of the main characters (Theresa) has some of her previous memory restored. This flood of memories that came rushing towards her must have had her drowning in a sea of nostalgia, because of this she makes decisions that could have a detrimental effect on those she loves.At the end of the film I was left with a similar feeling to the one I had at the end of the first film.

299,Aleksandar357,Fun to watch,6,27 October 2015,"Lets face it. The Maze Runner films are not great. They are good, but not that good. While the film was fun to watch it was full of already seen scenes. Not really original. Director did a good job, not that bad. Screenplay could have been better. You expect to see some of the cool post-apocalyptic cities and landscapes, but you do not get enough of that. A lot of cliché moments in the film. Should have been a little shorter. Also there are some illogical decision that characters made in the film, cannot really get into it without spoiling something. They tried to give it a little twist but it was not that surprising. Irritated me a little bit. Acting was good. I actually liked how they edited it out, not bad. Cinematography is good. All in all a good, fun film to watch. Everyone knew it was not going to be a masterpiece.Arguably maybe it even deserves 6/10. I was wondering what to give it, but because I like these kind of films it made my decision easier and I gave it 7/10.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
300,littlegrids,Made no sense,4,20 February 2016,"I didn't really like the first movie. I thought it was okay but it wasn't something I would've recommended for a movie night, so you can guess how much I cared when this one came out. But after a while I gave it a shot, mostly because I didn't have anything better to do - or so I thought. One of my friends (who had read the books) told me that I wouldn't understand a thing while watching this if I haven't read the book, and she was right. This film made absolutely no sense to me whatsoever and even I, who haven't read a single page of the books, knew that the creators of this film had done a horrible job adapting from the book. There were so many plot holes and the story went so fast that I could barely catch up on the story. They pretty much introduced about 76 characters (who all die like 20 minutes after they are first seen) whose impacts to the plot were so small that they could literally be replaced by a stuffed animal and the plot would remain the same. Like every other YA dystopian movies. Ranting aside, this movie wasn't a complete bag of manure. The visuals, like in the first film, was well-done and the soundtrack was great, I even liked this one's more than last one's. Most of the actors did a great job, which isn't surprising considering the fact the main cast consists of quite talented B-listers. But unless you are a hormonal teenager who has a massive crush on Dylan O'Brian or Thomas Brodie-Sangster and your only purpose to watch this is to stare at them while ignoring the plot, this film is not worth your time.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I went to see it with my family like the last movie we did as a family - the started blew my mind, i loved it where they took it off from the last movie! Getting into the film i saw some hicups with it - where they haven't got new ideas, they have kind of copied off other movies, e.g. The Hunger Games had their own creatures and monster the battle that are a massive remake on the old creature but they had some similar things to show they created them. But it The Maze Runner 2 (This movie) they have more or less copied and not change a thing about the creatures! The story line is amazing: don't get me wrong but they didn't recreate something that say 'Here this is my amazing remake' which they needed to.

This movie felt like 2638287 hours it was just boring and I was disappointed this is not something you can compete tho the first movie ok the action was cool and entertaining but it took so long until the action started the cgi was really good with the buildings etc. And the acting was not the best but ok I am sure that there are people who like this movie but if you didn't enjoy the first movie then you will not enjoy this movie either I was just hoping that all the movies where going about the maze.,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

It has some action, some love triangle(-ish stuff), minor characters that could be great if had the chance to be.But this is not a book adaptation. This has NOTHING to do with the book, therefore it was a huge, huge disappointment for me because the book is more than good. But the movie? The movie is a lie, to be honest. I don't even know where to begin. Everything is changed. Just one - important - example: Scorch Trials, this is the title. In the book, it IS a trial. In the movie? You can only guess what they meant when they named it ""trial"". It's a completely different story than the book, and by different I mean worse. I can't even imagine how are they going to close it because it's... It's just not the story I read. Many essential things were missing that made the book creepy, exciting, unique and unforgettable. Action scenes were simply erased or turned into boring clishé. The feeling of a thrill was totally gone. The characters became flat, and the conversations were all like ""GO GO GO"" or ""WATCH OUT"" or ""What is your plan, Thomas?"" That's it. That's the movie.

They discover and outside city with rebels and were forced into drinking something to basically go on a trip through a party/rave and then the story line completely takes too many turns and it was hard to follow to the point I simply turned it off. I'm not saying don't see this movie... but this one you have to really pay attention too as they incorporate a few details that don't make sense but lost me half way through it.

I stayed the whole way through the movie thinking ""it can only get better from here"" and I was wrong.I am an ardent science fiction fan and really enjoy movies set in a dystopian society, but certainly not this one. Nowhere near as gripping as Mad Max Fury Road, no pulling of the heart strings such as in The Hunger Games and no plot surprises such as in Ender's Game.There are some good actors in the movie and I feel sorry for them. Poor Aidan Gillen - from GOT to this. The silk purses and sows ear proverb come to mind as I do not think it was possible to redeem this movie no matter how good the acting could have been.You can pick the plot from only a few minutes into the film , so no surprises there. The jerky POV action scenes makes them unwatchable and that was, in some ways, a relief from the tedium of the rest of the movie.

It's a movie I enjoyed and that's what makes it a perfect 10 for me. Thank you for all your hard work guys. So this movie will remind you of other movies like Hunger Games, but this gives you its own original story of course. It was definitely a step up from the first movie with its story and action.

I remember leaving the first one thoroughly entertained, but with many questions in my head that I didn't feel the movie answered (to my satisfaction).The second movie is no different - but still very entertaining. It is full of very well-orchestrated action scenes, stunning vistas, solid acting and craftsmanship in all departments, and - my favorite part - expertly crafted zombies.They are convincing, nice and scary, and I don't begrudge the fact that they seem to have been heavily inspired by the video game Last of Us (they even make the same clicking sounds as the Clickers in the game, and mature to bizarre and deadly growths in dark tunnels).The less brilliant parts of the movie mostly consist of dumb lines (it's really unnecessary to constantly tell people to hurry up, when they're already running for their lives) and situations in where the characters act incredibly naive - e.g. Minho switching on power in a large abandoned building to make a raucous of noise when the group is supposed to be hiding, and when they know there are flesh-hungry zombies at large.Teresa has all her memories back and yet no one seems to be particularly interested in finding out what she remembers. The group separates repeatedly without coordinating it in any way, which leads to them of course getting into trouble separately instead of working together and helping each other out. Brenda and Thomas enter dark and crank-infested sewers, and instead of being cautious, they talk at full volume, shout, and, of course, separate again for no reason.I don't blame the movie for not making sense all the time, since the book does even less so, and because it makes up for the lack in logic and the lazy writing by just being plain fun to watch.Go in with medium to low expectations, and you'll have an excellent time!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
313,daniel-leal-san,A review for those who didn't read the books,7,4 November 2015,"I understand the outrage of fans who know the original story, but I can't admit another movie review - which is based on the original story - as if he were obliged to follow the book. No film is required to follow anything, what matters to me it is if i'm gonna have a good time or not.Spoiler Free.The Maze Runner trilogy, now released his second film, delivers a different scenario for a subject (zombies and apocalypse) already known. In Scorch Trials the protagonist Thomas and his friends are taken to a second Wickd base where they discover some new secrets worse than those find out on the maze. They get away, going through some new places, discovering even more secrets, some new plots begin to emerge and new faces joined the group. It obvious that a middle movie wouldn't deliver all the answers. Do not expect an end that explains something, but surely moves the story and introduces some cool surprises.Other reviews indicate that Scorch Trials is a waste of your time, but I completely disagree. It's a movie for entertainment, following a different story and made me interested in Tomas group, which like every other Hunger Games movie falls into cliché of be ethnically diverse, although they are very charismatic and makes you cheer for them.I chose to leave out the film cons since so many other reviews have focused only on the bad side. It's a good movie and certainly made me want to see the third one. If you didn't read the books and just want to keep up with a cool story, this is a movie for you.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
314,nolanmenachemson,The Scorch(ed) Plot,3,19 December 2015,"Here are the five reasons I gave this film 1 star: 1. The basic dystopian premise doesn't make sense. What has actually destroyed civilisation: a zombie apocalypse or global warming? How did a zombie plague manage to dry up the East River under what is the unmistakable design of John Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge? Why are there sand dunes?! 2. The plot doesn't make sense. If the children were tested in the original Maze to survive in the dystopian world outside, then why are they now special children being harvested for their antibodies? This makes no sense: are they special because they survived the maze or because they have immunity to the zombie plague? What on earth has the one got to do with the other? Further, why kill the children if their bodies are constantly producing anti-plague antibodies?! You would want them to remain alive to produce more white blood cells, not die! And who kills children when humanity is about to become extinct? 3. The props and backdrop don't make sense. How are is evil organisation WICKED generating electrical power? And how are they using Wi-Fi/Internet if civilisation is destroyed? The cars outside are cars from the year 2015 and they aren't rusted, so we can presume it's about 2015. What's a bigger miracle: That WKD has working broadband in a world without working optic fibre.. or holographic comms technologies and advanced alien medical procedures that probably won't be invented for another 80 - 150 years? Also, if the teenagers have walked from New York City across Brooklyn Bridge onto Long Island, why are there Mountains in Connecticut about a days' work North through Queens? NY has some of the flattest real estate in the United States. 4. Why did the movie steal blatantly emulate animation from World War Z, post-apocalypse sets similar to both The Book of Eli and to Mad Max, and smelt at times like the Divergent series? Is it because in 20th Century Fox's race to capitalise on the dollars of the first Maze movie by quickly formatting James Dashner's second Maze book into a film, they forgot that movies actually need character development? Shuffling a group of Goonies from one reactive situation to another without depth of interaction is like having Kirk and Spock running along some desolate planet for 131 painstaking minutes, without any plot- building dialogue. Character development can be done on the run, by the way. Even Riddick, who doesn't say much, had a personality. WICKED Chancellor Ava Paige would make a good evil wife for President Snow in the Hunger Games, except the Hunger Games is superior to the Maze series on every level of dystopia. The 20% of the film that unfolded during daylight was refreshing. Most of the film was done in almost total darkness and I couldn't tell what was going on some of the time. Felt like a 1970s film where one sits and looks as an almost black screen with lots of shooting going on. 5. The most important reason I gave this film 1 star is because it under-utilised the acting prowess of two wonderful young actors. The two Gladers in question, Dylan O'Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster are going to be great actors if their managers find them the kind of method films that catapulted Leonardo DiCaprio to fame.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
315,wihanhendrikz,"Surprisingly, brilliant.",8,29 September 2015,"First thing, if you can watch this film in 3D, do it! It is the first film I've watched that understood the value of 3D; it didn't try and fill the movie with gimmicks of something flying inches from your face, or debris that made you dodge for your life. This film's approach to 3D technology was a form of art, it was delicately applied as to truly immerse the viewer. It lent a sense of gravity to everything in the film, not just the action scenes. Every moment benefited from it. I repeatedly forgot that I was sitting in a 3D movie, which in my opinion is the moment where a technology transcends being a gimmick and gains its rightful place as an art form. It wasn't something to be noticed, it became something felt and experienced.Apart from that; the scenery, cinematography and music were spot-on. The acting was brilliant with a great cast and a good immersion into their relationships. The writing and directing of the movie flowed seamlessly throughout. This brings me to the story itself. I have read the book, and recognise the plethora of changes that were made for the film adaption. My opinion: the movie didn't suffer under it. It made the movie a separate entity that stood side-by-side with the book. I personally find the assumption that a film adaptation of a novel should stick tightly to the plot of the book, quite meaningless. They are two different media and to force a plot from one onto the other becomes detrimental to the story itself. For that reason, I quite enjoyed the differences, it made the movie far more interesting not knowing exactly what to expect. Some scenes were certainly improved upon, although others left me wanting. Ultimately, this was a film that for once got the typical adaptation issue right, in my opinion. They made a movie that wasn't just a graphical representation of the book. They made it a movie. One that told the same story as the book, but in its own way. On all accounts I have to give this film a great thumbs up, however everything together does lead to movie that was slightly too long and that had some scenes that were a bit dull. I would say that people who aren't familiar with the trilogy or the characters might find this film tedious.In my opinion, it was a great movie filled with many moments that neither excited me nor moved me, yet I was captivated. It was what all film adaptations should be. It was like reading a book in graphic form. The immersion was enthralling.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
316,kburtonshea,Excellent Film,8,24 September 2015,"My 12 yr old son has wanted to see this since reading the books and obviously seeing the first of the films last year.Now, after a long day in the office I can say that the last thing I wished to do was take him to the cinema to see this, I had a neatly folded potato suit sat on the couch waiting for me, and a couple of perfectly chilled canned beverages in the fridge.Anyway my wishes completely ignored I found myself at the cinema watching this, and it is at this stage I can begin enthusing about the film. As an adult, I really enjoyed this film. There you go.Not knowing in great detail the story, I was picking it up as best as possible, so I'm in no position to provide spoilers or great plot reviews.For me, there were some great sections of proper suspense and tension, with some truly dark moments in the mix. The action alongside this was superbly and creatively done, and some of the characters along the way bringing a great presence to the mix. At over 2 hours long, it didn't feel it, with great fluidity throughout, the time soon went by.As youth audience films go, its much better than the Hunger Games, which to me lack the edge they could bring at times So, a big thumbs up from me and I'll head to the next installment with less thoughts about the potato suit! To all the dads out there putting it off, take the sprog along, enjoy and don't feel bad for doing so!.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
317,rcwin32,An exciting follow-up that's bigger and better in every way!,10,6 December 2015,"First things first, I haven't read any of the books, so this review will be solely off of the movie. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie and I think it deserves a lot more credit than what critics and people are giving it. I thought the pacing throughout the movie was spot on. At no point in the movie was I bored or waiting for something to happen. I found myself on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. The action scenes were well choreographed and the camera work was great! Put that together with the gorgeous visual effects and you have a visually stunning movie. I thought the actors did a great job. I found it easy to connect with both new and old characters in this movie, and maybe even a little more than the first installment. Nobody steals the show because everyone did a fantastic job! The plot was interesting, clear, and not predictable, which made the movie even more thrilling and entertaining! The ending was satisfying, yet it kept me wanting more.All in all, this movie was really enjoyable! A great action movie that is very re-watchable, worthy of more credit than it receives. I am looking forward to the final installment and if it is anything like this one, it should be great as well! With that being said, I highly recommend this movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
318,purpleleman,"Brilliant film, great sequel, worth a watch",9,21 September 2015,"I'll keep my review short and sweet, the good points were as follows: We meet a whole host of interesting new characters who really help the plot and make the movie better. We see progress of our escapees as they try to get away from WICKED. We find out slightly more about the world outside the maze. We find out that there is a cure of sorts on its way (gives us hope). We have a bit of emotional turmoil along with the characters (is WICKED good? They're working on a cure, is Theresa right?) The twist is good but not necessarily a surprise, where they go from here is going to be interesting. The action scenes are genuinely amazing.Now the bad points: We're still unsure why they'd put them in the maze with the giant monsters when these guys are so very valuable? The storms and the cranks and WICKED are a large quantity of enemies/obstacles, let alone very powerful ones, do we really believe these kids would make it? We don't fully know where they're headed, do we actually believe that there is a safe haven and that they will indeed be safe there? (I don't, as usually happens in these types of films, IT'S A TRAP). WHO is Mary and why do I feel like I recognise her?! We lost the way that the infected would get angry and their personalities would change, it has turned into a zombie movie, where the bite makes you one of them very quickly, but in the maze there was another stage to the transformation. After 2+ hours of film they're really not much further on. The ""Trials"" part of the title is very misleading, there are no trials here! This is not like the hunger games, I don't even know why they bothered with that, The Scorch is barely mentioned either. Aiden Gillan's accent at times slipped slightly back to Irish.Genuinely amazing film, very little wrong with it compared to most sequels. Compared to Hunger Games it holds it's own, compared to Divergent it absolutely smashes it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

The police are not our friends.This movie is a great reminder that the police are simply an organized terrorist organization within America that wants to take away your rights and put you in a cell.America needs more movies like this to show America how they are slaves to the government controlled by corporate interests who just want them to bow long enough until computerized replacements can take their place.

320,Magenta_Antoid,Not too bad,6,24 October 2015,"One complaint I have is the film was too dark so I couldn't tell much of what was going on. Apart from that, there's a lot of action in the film with a few nice scary scenes, but as mentioned by others not a lot of plot, and what little plot there is can be quite rushed and often contains the typical clichés of this genre. It's not really groundbreaking material. Also as often happens the tense action scenes seemed too contrived and conveniently timed with the heroes always just escaping in the nick of time. It felt a bit repetitive at times. Going back to the rushed plot, at the end of the film I still felt like I wasn't sure exactly what was going on and I also felt like I wasn't rooting for the main hero but rather the people who were supposed to be evil, I guess that makes me evil haha. Still, there were some enjoyable scenes as well as memorable characters, and overall I enjoyed the film. I especially liked Brenda and Jorge as they weren't your typical black-and-white characters but slightly more realistic ones with positive and negative traits and they generally made the scenes they were in quite fun to watch. The two hours I spent watching the film went by quite fast and if you're just looking for light entertainment I recommend it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

322,grampaglasses,Generic dystopian movie,4,9 October 2015,"Complete disaster of a movie. It takes every terrible dystopian teen movie cliché and just throws them together to see what sticks. Considering how completely unlike the book it is, it makes me suspect they were shooting off of the first draft or something.First off is the characterization. Not a single character does or say anything interesting the entire movie. There's no slower scenes where they just talk about stuff. No, instead it's always dialogue that moves the plot along. This is a freaking horrible thing to do, as this means you don't even care if a character dies or not.Another huge bother is the quite horrid CGI and greenscreen in some parts. Most apparent is the completely out of place CGI rat in the sewers, when Brenda is hanging off a window, and a few shots where they're running from far away against the background. They invested 61 MILLION dollars into this movie, there's no excuse for this.Honestly, there's no real point in watching this movie. It's just a trailer for Death Cure.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
323,GhostMorgan,Making Stuff Up,5,28 January 2016,"The movie starts as The Maze Runner finished (the prior offering in this trilogy), complete with a short recap. All well and good. However, I only assume that the director, screenwriter, actors and everyone else involved in this project used this point in the movie to ""get creative"". I assume in the movie business this means ""make stuff up"" and ""do action, and stuff"". I know, I know, this is what is meant to happen in fiction. But, someone had already ""made stuff up"" and it was in a book called ""The Scorch Trials"" and it came after another book called ""The Maze Runner"". So, when people go to watch a film called ""The Scorch Trials"" that comes after a film called ""The Maze Runner"" that bears a striking similarity to ""The Maze Runner"" book one must conclude that the film ""The Scorch Trials"" is similar to the book entitled ""The Scorch Trials"". Wrong! This is ""other made up stuff"". Confused? Unlike the book of the same name, this is a zombie story set in, what looks like, Benidorm post-summer season. To be fair, the movie passes two hours interestingly enough. Nothing too outrageous (given the context) and nothing too cheap (given the budget). However, may I suggest the makers of the movie alter the title somewhat so as not to confuse the film with the book, maybe call it something like ""The Scorch Trail""?",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
324,jacobwest-57888,Brilliant,9,11 October 2015,"The first movie in The Mazerunner series was very good and i loved the mysticism of the maze. But one thing i thought about the first movie was that it seemed a bit teeny with the whole story revolving around these young teens. Furthermore it did not have the broader aspect like this sequel does: now you are drawn into the real world. This movie has a much more raw and thrill-like vibe surrounding it, which i personally like better than the first one. I heard some reviews saying that this movie is nothing like the first one, and i will agree with them on that. This movie is very different from the first, but i am glad that this is the case. Because, staying in the same theme as the first movie without new plots, would only be like dragging the first movie longer. And we all know that even a good movie can be ruined by a prolonged and slow plot. So the point here is: i prefer all the new stuff happening in this movie and i am happy that it is not like the first movie. Anyways. You should definitely go watch this movie, it has many nice sci-fy aspects that u will like if you are into that genre. There are Zombies, apocalyptic world scenes, monster like mutated zombies and much more. Enjoy",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
325,calligulden,"So many plot holes, not even the Gladers could dodge 'em.",7,19 September 2015,"Before I pick apart the movie completely, I'd like to rate it on it as a movie itself. It was AMAZING. They did a phenomenal job with the suspense and it kept me on the edge of my seat from the very beginning. The characters were a bridge between funny and outright mysterious. But. If you've read the books, this was not the books. Yes they kept the title. They kept the character names (Except Aris' name...they said Aaron a couple times...) The main part I'd like to address is how Wes Ball took the original Cranks bringing a horrific nightmare fuel theme into the books to complete Zombie Clichés. Not only were the Cranks zombies, but I found the scene with the almost evil dead style vine creatures completely unnecessary. In the books I couldn't get over the horrific image of the Cranks because they weren't zombies--they were people gone completely mad. This movie took the book and burned it. There was no aspect of this movie that covered anything in the book which makes me fear for The Death Cure. While I loved Brenda and Jorge's characters in this, they didn't really fit that of the book in so much the sense that they weren't even immune. They also ditched the whole names-based-on-famous-historical-figures thing, given Teresa's background. As I read The Kill Order i began to feel that DeeDee was Teresa. To be honest there's not enough I can say about this film other then, It did not advance the plot in any sense, it made no sense, and it killed the most amazing scenes of the book. However, it was a truly amazing movie in itself. Suspenseful, action-thriller. It exceeded my expectations as a movie, but as an adaptation it failed worse than any other adaptation of a book ever.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
326,sapsfordben,Good but had so much more potential,5,26 September 2015,"There are some elements of this film that are amazing, like the computer generated imagery of the abandoned city was fantastic as it gave us a very realistic idea of what a city would be like if a event like that was to ever happen. Second I have to say hats off to the actors and actresses with outstanding performances all round. But. This was a good film but if it had kept to the storyline of the book it would have been a fantastic film. The book was an amazing read, not only did it keep my attention all the way but it also makes you think about what it happening and who is actually on who's side. In the book Teresa betrayed Tomas on a much more personal level. But above all as the title suggests the film was supposed to be the second phase of the WICKED trials but ended up being turned into some sort of escape slash zombie apocalypse movie. In short the film was a good film but it could have been an outstanding movie. What they had was an original idea thanks the imagination of James dasher but what they produced was nothing new just another zombie movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
327,kate-57933,A rocky camera isn't action!,5,28 September 2015,"I really liked the first part and really enjoy YA movies. I was quite a bit disappointed by this movie.The action was mostly created by weird rocky camera movements, as if they were running with the camera wrapped around them. There was hardly any real action.Also, if it's the ""Scorch"" trials, where are the trials? They ran a bit, they fought a few ""zombies"", but didn't even break into sweat. Isn't ""scorch"" supposed to be hot?Also, why is Brenda, who plays one of the main roles in the second half of the movie not even foreshadowed before.

328,clare_ms,An Interesting Direction,7,5 October 2015,"I saw Maze Runner:The Scorch Trials this weekend and was actually quite surprised. Y^es the movie was fast paced, tense and interesting, but it hardly kept to the books at all. Whereas in the first movie they basically kept to the same plot line apart from Thomas and Teresa's telepathy and the whole jumping into thin air to get to the griever den/exit. but in this movie they deviated from the plot significantly. there was no trial that they had been set to do, to make it across the scorch to the mountain to the safe haven where they would all be given the cure to the Flare. No alternative girl group, no personality tattoos, no plot between Aries and Teresa and no fight between the Groups and the Bio-mechanical being made by WCKD. in short, it was not what I was expecting. but still it was an amazing film, I enjoyed it immensely. The tension and the drama added with beautiful flashes of humour that made the whole cinema chuckle, more than made up for the plot changes and opened the story up for a better story line in the next film, which I am very excited for. One final not I would like to address and one of the few downsides, I disliked how the movie was turned into a ""Zombie Apocalypse"" type movie, and also felt that it resonated much of the same scenes and ideas from the game , ""The Last of Us"" whereas I do like that game, i thought that the Director/ Screenwriter/ whoever was in charge of the set designs and story, maybe let it influence them a bit too muck.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Just don't, please. That way they won't ever consider making the sequel and those blockbuster film producers and makers would at last get that people nowadays have waaaaay more expectations and making nothing is better than making something this stupid and being that confident to even think going to part 3.

332,williamskumar,Another forgettable YA adaptation,6,22 January 2016,"I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised by the first Maze Runner. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien), Minho (Ki Hong Lee), and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), didn't seem like knock offs from The Hunger Games or Divergent and the overall plot was original enough (mostly) to keep me interested. The story didn't really make a whole lot of sense (kids need to survive a maze to find a cure?), but it was fun so that was enough. The Scorch Trials, unfortunately, does not follow the same formula. I recently read that the film adaptation deters from the book which is unfortunate because after watching the movie I feel that staying closer to the book would have been better. To make a long point short, The Scorch Trials simply doesn't make a lot of sense. Thomas and the gang escape yet another WCKD facility and come across and gang led by Jorge (Giancarlo Esposito) and his kind of adopted daughter Brenda (Rosa Salazar). After escaping an attempt to recapture them, Thomas and Brenda are quickly separated from the others, run into zombies, explore an abandon city, and then run into a resistance force of sorts dedicated to finding a cure to the flare and bringing down WCKD. All the while we get some quick exposition that tries to explain how this world came to be, but it doesn't seem believable or even original. A solar flare caused a plague? Again, why do potential patients who are immune to the disease need to survive a maze? Questions like these are never answered and they linger in the background. Another problem with The Scorch Trials is that it doesn't feel like anything too different from what we have seen in The Hunger Games or Divergent. Yes the first one may have seemed unique, but the second movie falls into the same type plot and character development. One could have easily switched out Thomas for Katniss or Beatrice and had the same movie. The betrayal of Teresa was even predictable to the point where I found myself asking not if, but when it would happen. I will watch the third movie so that I can finish the story, but hopefully there will be some improvements. As stands now there isn't really anything to make The Scorch Trials fun or memorable.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

It's pretty much an action film and one that looks good.It's not brilliant, but neither are the Hunger Games or the Divergent series. It's aimed at a teen audience.

(It won't be long.)From the mish-mash plot that is a combo of too numerous science fiction movies to describe here, which in this movie don't even come close to making sense, to the lowest of low budgets with virtually 1960's special effects that last no more than 5 minutes, this movie is a loser. If you like science fiction, like I do, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!However, this movie could win an Oscar, if they give one for seemingly lowest budget films of the year. Over an hour of the movie is watching kids running through corridors being chased by somebody or some-use- to -be bodies. They must have used some old factory building and wrote graffiti on the walls, used spot lighting and then playing eerie music filmed these kids running around. And they run. And run. Then they run. They run into virus infected ""Walking Dead"" zombies. (I guess that somehow this movie is a sequel to ""I Am Legend."" Will Smith must have never developed that antidote. Or perhaps they were ""Revers"" from ""Serenity."")What in the world did they spend $63 million on to film this garbage? Was the factory they used in down town LA or a beach front property owned by the producer's brother?Plot: Plot? What plot?

The first film did have other great points - the slow developing relationships between the characters, the unknown electronic/biological creatures that cause illness, the formation of groups with insiders and outsiders.

343,kmb805,Scorch Trials,5,19 September 2015,"I haven't read the books so I only form my opinion based on the movies. You can't watch this sequel without seeing the first one - The Maze Runner. There are no flashbacks to the previous movie, no montage that sums it up and the story picks up right where it left off. Also it mentions characters and events from it.Thomas is the POV character in this one too, also the leader and the only character who has any personality. Fortunately he's played by Dylan O'Brian who gives a great performance. We don't really get to know the boys or Teresa any better since they're still suffering from memory loss and that gives the creators a nice loophole to not do any character development. Most of the movie takes place in a giant desert, some post apocalyptic city full of wrecked skyscrapers. It's photographed beautifully by Gyula Pados. Despite the title there is no trial in this installment, instead they're constantly on the run from WCKD. The company that was depicted evil in the first movie, now things are not simply black and white and maybe trying to find a cure for the virus really is the most important thing. The whole plot consists of the Gladers trying to find the rebellion so they can stop WCKD. Along the way they find new allies and some new type of infected people who look like zombies. Even though they're constantly on the run there is no sense of urgency. That's the most glaring error of the movie along with not being able to stand on its own. You can watch the Maze Runner then stop and it's still makes a complete experience. It's kind of like the Matrix trilogy in this way, but at least there the creators told that part 2 and 3 are one movie just split apart. In the Scorch Trials you think that you're gonna get answers or at least be able to ask more questions but there's no such thing here, the whole movie feels like a stopgap for the third one. I only recommend to watch this if you're a fan of the young stars, especially Dylan O'Brien and Rosa Salazar.

345,piperjoel4,"Exciting, confused and different",7,17 October 2015,"What, what? I'm sorry... zombies? Within the first five minutes of The Scorch Trials we are thrown for a confusing and ever changing gambit of what is popular today with what is happening in the plot. In the end of the first Maze Runner film we are told the world was destroyed by an epic disease and that which the world as we know it has been trying to find a cure. We are told that these boys (and girl) are our last resort in finding a cure and their trials that they have been facing will all be explained as they help find a cure and solution for this deadly virus. A deadly virus which turns out to be something that you'd expect to see on The Walking Dead. And the corporation that has been putting these young adults through their trials is just a fascist regime looking to save their own skin. I entered this movie expecting this group of teens to be sent into a second trial, like the first, which they would have to fight off more strange living robotic creatures to find another solution bringing them one step closer to solving the riddle behind everyone's death. But instead of getting what the title of the movie implies, I got something entirely different. Now, I'd like to go on the record and say that i thoroughly enjoyed myself watching The Scorch Trials. The plot was fast paced, the acting was, once again excellent, the injustice and crimes against humanity by the governing force was real and hit straight to the heart; you find yourself rooting for these teens to survive and find a way to stop the horrible acts against their fellow Maze solving individuals. The film keeps in tow with current themes in pop culture, such as teens choosing to get drunk and party, hiding from the truth and difficulty of what life really is, or maybe just people taking advantage of others for their own gain. But we are always left hoping that they make the wise choice and the best decisions and help each other, because this movie really is about having faith that humanity isn't lost and that some people are inherently good. The Scorch Trials, though different from what you might have expected is an exciting journey standing up for itself and running alongside it's predecessor as it's own entity. It left me excited for what will come next in the post apocalyptic world of WCKD and the Right Army questioning who will win, and who is right? Yes there were strange zombie creatures, and yes it wasn't what I was expecting, but YES, I had a great time in the movies blown away by a teen-aged version of Mad Max racing through the desert while being chased by a violent and possibly evil regime. Go see this movie with an open mind ready for an exciting journey.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
346,sid389,Dear God... Why Why Why Why Why Why,1,1 December 2015,All the way through this god awful film I questioned every character action. Like why not take the gun after Winston shoots himself? Is a gun only good for letting Winston commit suicide? Why take so long when the building is collapsing? Why are you staring at the zombies?? RUN!!! Why skate along a board walk whilst holding the handrail? SPRINT!! The only reason I watched this shitty film is because I made the mistake of watching the first one... I don't like leaving movie franchises unfinished...Do Not Watch This Piece Of *beep*!!! They could have done something great with this film yet it is riddled with the typical movie error of: That Is Not What Anyone Would Do In That Situation!,Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
347,kris-caluwaerts,A disappointment after seeing the first movie,2,4 February 2016,"This movie was completely not in line with my expectations. I haven't read the books so my expectation was based on the first movie. The movie started quite OK but very fast the story went in a completely opposite way from what I was expecting and become another walking zombie movie like I have seen so many others. Where the first movie was build around an original concept this movie is what I would call a cheap copy of existing zombie movies. I found it a waste of time and caught me thinking ""what kind of b*llsh*t am I watching"". I checked the spoiler flag because what I wrote about the zombies tells more or less the complete story of this movie. Very disappointing.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
348,Jaclantic,What a way to ruin the book...,5,15 September 2015,"Being someone who loved the books in the Maze Runner series I couldn't wait to see this film, as I thought the first installment was brilliant, however by the end of The Scorch Trials I wish I hadn't bothered. For a start the whole point of this movie was that it was the next phase of the trials to test the group further, instead the group escape and are then being hunted for the rest of the feature. Not only this, but the group seek to find a faction - The Right Arm - however this rebellion isn't even mentioned until the third book - why has it been brought in so early? Another annoying aspect was, due to the order of the film being distorted, I had no idea when the film was going to end, therefore it felt like it was dragging somewhat after the 1hr 30min mark. Rant over.Credit where credit is due - I never felt bored during this film. Despite the constant feeling of ""that's not what happens"" it had me intrigued as to where it might be going, although I can't even begin to imagine what could happen in the next sequel. Overall Scorch Trials isn't that bad, it's action packed and is always on the move, however it's just massively disappointing that such a good book has been completely changed so that it's barely recognisable.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
349,rosefors,So why is this movie so underrated?,9,24 November 2015,"This is my first review ever on IMDb after being a daily visitor for some 10 years, and the reason being that this movie is a perfect example of how polarized the scoring and the reviews of movies can be on IMDb.Contrary to many of the critics who discrete this movie, I have not read the books, yet. Therefore I had no higher expectations over its sequel which I thought was quite decent, but not much more than that. And now after watching it I find it being heavily underrated and unfairly criticized so its hard to make sense of it all.Looking at the competition of zombie flicks, ""28 days later"" that is brilliant in some ways but quite frankly utterly unbelievable and mad in many other has a substantially higher scoring. An even better example is ""World War Z"", an utterly stupid movie that somehow still scores noticeably higher than the Maze runner sequel. It's a bit shameful really considering that Brad Pitt has almost consistently been part of some of the best movies ever produced, like ""Moneyball"". Therefore when considering that the name of one of the most overrated movies ever is ""Fury"", this might actually give an indication on what is going on here.But setting that a side for a bit I must say that I really liked this movie. Putting this in the same category of sci-fi / adventure / game-challenge as the ""Hunger Games"" movies as well as the two ""Divergent/Insurgent"" movies, I actually might think this is the best one of them all. I do admit that both the story and the artistry and choreography of the Hunger Games movies are on another level, but the Scorch Trials is much easier digested and in many ways appeal a somewhat more mature audience. The scenes are fast paced, the cutting is very good, the sound effects are excellent! and its not over bloated with cgi. The action scenes are actually rather believable, delivering just the right amount without tiring you down and things move about in accordance with physics and gravity most of the time. The sound effects are very finely tuned and with a 5.1 DTS track delivers some freakishly believable chopper hovering and bullet ricochets and has also some very nicely adjusted low level frequency effects delivering just the right amount of rumble to the kicker for those that have one and a sound system to match. Best of all is that you don't need to put up with all the Lawrence grunting and wining and the stupid laughter of Caesar Flickerman. No matter what he does he will never bee as super green as Ruby Rhod. But I do miss Philip Seymour Hoffman though. Hmm..Anyway, there are some scenes in this movie that I especially liked. When Thomas and the rest of the Gladers climbed down through the atrium of a huge deserted blacked-out shopping mall, it caught the atmosphere ""of the unknown"" very nicely and on par with the scene where Robert runs after Sam into a building in ""I am legend"" in terms of nail biting. But the thing that got me going is how brilliant the imagery and the detailing was and I'm a bit curious how the graphics were done. Another scene that really caught me was the hallucination scene with some really nice in/out focus, light effects accompanied with a Gabriel&Dresden version of a classic progressive tune (As the Rush Comes) remixed and played frequently by both Tiesto and Armin Van Buuren when it was a huge hit in the middle of the last decade.So, if you want to watch something not too complicated, like nice cut scenes and if you liked ""Pacific Rim"" type of movies with at least some well thought of effects, but never really adopted to ""Battleship"", ""Battle for LA"" or any other brain dead Michael-bay-explosion-oriented CGI-flicks, this might actually be a movie worth watching.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

This was what I considered to be one of the best, most terrifying scenes of the entire series and it was the essence of the cranks. That they are people, ridden with a disease that doesn't make them groaning moaning generic zombies but instead it takes away their morality, their humanity, their souls. This was the aspect I found most displeasing about the film. Not that it completely disregarded the entire plot line of the novels but rather that they turned it into a crappy generic CGI'd zombie movie. I barely made it through the entire thing and if I was Dashner, I would be embarrassed by the mockery they made of my really great story.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

And most of all, they obviated the principal motivation they had to get to the mountains to the refugee that was never mentioned in this movie: it was to get the cure as they were all infected, they new it was a proved, they did not escape. And that is how they get to wicked and then escape in the third part. I do not know how are they going to explain why the scientist act like that to get the cure: it was because they were all infected and the illness was going to develop on then sooner or later, it does not makes sense now as all the people in the world just have the probability to get sick if someone bites them.

First of all the plot was absolutely terrible! I read the book and even though the book kind of sucked this was seriously 100 times worse.Secondly they didn't explain anything, they must've skipped like 2/3 of the book and just took in the ""cool"" parts because it made no sense at all. First they ran off to a desert walking for 20 minutes, secondly they found some zombies, third walked somewhere, found some more zombies and oops WICKED hates us. Someone dies and poff the end. They introduced about a 100 different unimportant characters and pretty much killed them ofimmediately. Most of them were flat and were just plot devices. No character development at all, seriously they stayed the same throughout the whole film.The cinematography part was alright, and the music was great.

Can't be done through the the app so I am typing this on a little safari page on my phone. I'm doing this for one reason - to possibly save one person like you from wasting their time or money. This movie is awful, just awful. Crappy zombie rip off with the worst of the Hunger Games added in. Since IMDb requires ten lines in the review I will add that the directing is the biggest weakness with the acting close behind.

There was no trial involvedm7n this movie. All that happened should have been a test from wckd not them running from wckd. And a big compound where they are killing immunes? What? I don't even know if they'll be able to make a third movie with the reviews they have on this one and if they do can they fix the mistakes they made in this movie? I am just supper disappointed.

First and third acts were great, my only problem was that the second act drags on for about 15-20 minutes but then picks right up again. The cinematography is well done lots of great camera angles. There could've been a little less shaky cam on the action scenes but overall there was just enough of it. Special Fx, sets, etc. were very well done considering the low budget that this film had ($61M), films like this would be costing close to $80M or $100M to make nowadays, but this is what you get when you have talented filmmakers.

It lends heavily from other plots such as I am legend and mixes in its fair share of action scenes with the expected shooting and explosion. The suspense of the unknown so very present in the first is very sadly missing in this sequel. Furthermore the explanation of why Wicked is doing what it is doing is very obvious. To its merit the special effects are quite good and the acting is not that bad (even though a bit fake at times). Camera action is quite good yet the scene portraying climbing vertically in skyscrapers does not portray the dizzying effect it should have.

It spent 120 minutes taking us along some adventures, which ended up with nothing being solved or learned. I know just as much as I did in the first movie and wasted 4 hours getting there. This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. Book readers will tell you this is grossly different than the book, but I haven't read it yet. What was the point of the title? Why are these kids so important? And really, what is Wicked's end game? Why does Thomas matter as much as he does?The whole narrative has crapped out.

But the extensive use of shaky cam rendered what would have been enjoyable action scenes almost unwatchable. I don't know why film makers these days have latched on to this fad. I don't get motion sick. Mostly I find the constant shaking just down right annoying. You get shots of ground or wall or the back of someone's head, instead of an action scene that is comprehensible where the audience can see what is taking place. I realize the intent is to give a sense of realism, but let's face it; we don't see the world shake and move like this when we ourselves run around. I would say somewhere around 75% of the action was done in shaky cam. On top of that, some of the scenes where the characters are just sitting around chatting is also done in shaky cam. Next time, advertise the movie as a found footage movie, so I at least know to avoid it.

Set in a facility on the edge of what is left of what looks like Los Angeles, Thomas and his gang have to decide whether to believe his saviors or keep running through the dessert known as the Scorch. I know it is a bit spoiler ridden but the title is after all The Scorch Trials.... so yeah.I loved the action and fast paced scenes. Much of this second installment felt like the first. Thomas is still leading the group towards something that he doesn't even understand, they are slowly getting more and more answers and memories, and you are learning the big bad why this is happening.Small Spoiler Ahead!!!You meet the infected, known as Cranks, which are a hyper version of 28 days later, Last of Us, I am Legend, and World War Z. They are infected with a virus known as the Flare.This whole movie was a great lead up and build of what is to come. The only thing I am a bit worried about is that this feels like a four or five movie series to me with how they are progressing things along in stages. I'm just hoping that the next installment is possibly going to be in two parts, or they don't half ass and rush the last movie's story line along.If you've seen the first movie, The Maze Runner, you MUST go watch this one.

363,bwm7777,Maze Runner fans need to boycott this piece of trash,1,3 October 2015,"I haven't been this irritated at a screen writer since watching Dune. All I kept thinking throughout this two hour CGI monotony was ""what the hell were they thinking??"" And hoping it would end soon. I just re-read the book a couple of days before seeing this movie. Aside from a couple of extremely minor scenes and the character names, the Scorch Trials movie has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with the book. Or even the first movie by the same screen writer for that matter! Did this moron even READ the book before writing the script or was he just given a 5 minute briefing of the general idea and then cranked out the script in an afternoon? Because that's what it felt like. If I want to see zombies I'll watch The Walking Dead because the writing is several orders of magnitude better than this tripe. There is no second experiment after escaping the Maze. There is really no sensible connection at all to the Maze. There is no Rat Man explaining they have to make it to the Safe Haven before the deadline. There is no search for ""patterns"" developed by the subject's intense experiences. There is no telepathic link between Thomas and Teresa (which was a very important part of the story). There is no playing Group A against Group B. In fact there is NO experiment at all! - just the evil WCKD corporation trying to suck the blood from the kids (kind of like the zombies) because they are all immune to the Flare. That's really the only plot line. Really. And the Cranks are just your typical run of the mill zombies. But there are guns and grenades and explosions oh my! Lots of guns and explosions. This seems to be the only thing the imbeciles in Hollywood can think of doing when it comes to a movie like this.

A lot of actions, a lot of impressive successions and fantastic surprises, I'm completely overwhelmed and out of words.I haven't read the books, but I know that this movie was beyond all my expectations, with nothing brought from the actions of the Maze, the first great chef-d'oeuvre. And, it's an awesome mix of most genres, all adventure, sci-fi, action, thriller, mystery, drama and some comedy are blended together to form a stunning suspense experience to make you want more and more and more!I can never compare the two movies, everyone having his own taste, his own beautiful color of enigma, excitement and sequences, so that if you're not the style of the Maze - and you're sure wrong about it - you can never escape from watching the Scorch, and vice versa.

Well, if you consider the mechanic spiders-bees more realistic than what you saw in that movie, then I'll leave you in peace. Yes, the first movie had the tone of mystery and adventure but this one gives much more than this...This movie is adventurous, has a fast plot combined with action and rebel. They try to take their faith in their hands by pulling their own strings, they show brotherhood, tight friendship, and they also feel betrayed by those who mostly trust.

The pace is too fast (seems like a Transformer movie...), too action packed while the screenplay is too thin in my opinion. I would have honestly preferred a bit more talking and a bit less chasing. The beginning for instance is way too fast - not even half an hour in the movie and they got rescued, found a way to escape, found that something dodgy is going on in the place they are, found ""all"" the secrets they needed to know).

I don't doubt that this movie will perform better than the first, if anything, it'll blow up. The movie did not seem to have any faults from my eyes, and if anything, answered several questions that the first left unanswered.

All that made the book great is lost in the movie and I could barely watch the action non-sense going on till the end of it. Even the title doesn't make sense anymore as in the movie going through the scorch is not a trial at all and that was the most disappointing at all, along with it being so much ""softer"", less mysterious, cryptic and cruel than the books.

It has everything to do with the movie. If they didn't have permission to be there in the first place, it would have been a different setting.

373,matteamun,"Good Movie, But is NOT the Book",8,18 September 2015,"Okay, so right now I am actually very frustrated with this movie despite the 8/10 rating I gave it. As a movie, as in without thinking of the books, I thought it was really exciting and was made very well and think that everyone would enjoy it. In that case, I would totally recommend it. So yes, as a movie it was very good. It had a lot of action, the characters were amazing as always, although thought the character Aris was very unnecessary since they didn't stick to the book. Okay, so now I've explained why I gave it a good rating. But as a fan of the books, I thought the movie was TERRIBLE. It was absolutely nothing like the book. I know readers probably say that about pretty much every book that gets turned into a movie. Now, I get that sometimes directors have to cut some scenes out which I totally understand and will tolerate as long as you still get the story of the movie right and just do a great job with it. But in this case they might as well have cut out every scene in the book and just put in a bunch of confusing unnecessary and irrelevant scenes into the movie that were never in the book. Honestly, you can't even call this movie The Scorch Trials. Why would you if it isn't even the same story? While I watched the movie, right from the beginning I got mad and could already see the differences. But now, how they made this movie, I have know idea what they are going to do with The Death Cure because they changed the whole point of The Scorch Trials and based on the way it ended they have to make up a whole new story for The Death Cure because otherwise it will make absolutely zero sense. I have no idea what directors and movie companies are thinking when they decide to change so much of the story. The Maze Runner I thought was actually pretty good and stayed pretty true to the book and I thought The Scorch Trials was going to be even better since it was also such an awesome book and since they did a good job with the first movie I figured they would do a good job with the second one. But I was very disappointed. I hate that they even call it The Scorch Trials because it clearly isn't. I write stories, and I can't even imagine having it being made into a movie just to have the movie companies and directors totally change the whole story and think that they are making it better. I wouldn't even be able to handle that. What makes movie companies think that they know better? They aren't the authors. They aren't the creative ones. The authors are the masterminds. That is why there are so many fans; because of how the story already is. So, why do they take a story many people love and change it. Do they want is to suffer. Do they want us to hate the movies? I just don't get it!But anyways, I just had to write all of that down. Also, the Cranks were amazing as well as Brenda and Jorge, and of course Minho and Newt. But if you haven't read the books I think you will definitely like this movie, but if you have read the books and have strong opinions with whether it is true to the book then I think I would still see it just to see how it is and see for yourself what you think but don't expect it to be like the REAL story. I mean, I'm still glad I saw it I'm just really frustrated now. But all in all its a movie and I rated it as a movie. So as a movie it was very good and the Cranks were horrific.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
374,crash76er1,So much wrong with this film.,4,19 September 2015,"I really liked Maze runner, but still don't understand why they didn't just build a ladder to the top of the wall and walk out. This movie was full of WTF stupid moments that really bugs me.Like why didn't they just turn off the generator when they noticed that that's what brought the zombies to life?! Instead they just leave it on and like Monty Pithon they run away, run away!When Brenda and Thomas see that creepy growing red stuff on the walls of the sewer, anyone else, after all they have been through would have taken one look and said nope, I'm outta here, but instead they have to go fully investigate this dangerous looking creepy stuff. They could have found a better way to have Brenda get infected.When Thomas makes an impossible heroic save of Brenda from falling to the ground through the glass, are we really supposed to assume they had no trouble at all getting back to the doorway above and clear from danger?!When that guy is shooting the big gun off the back of the truck, first of all he is a horrible shot not able to hit a huge helicopter and second, why didn't he shoot the transport before the kids got on it. All the bad people were on it and ripe for the killing and yet he does nothing. I also thought Mary's character was way too short lived. Brenda and Thomas relationship was not played out well enough and I really don't like Teresa. Traitor bitch ;) Also couldn't they find a better song than After Midnight? AC/DC or Disturbed or something that sounded like destruction would have made for a better scene. I have not read the books, but maybe the film would be better if they hadn't heavily diverted away. Either way I think it was lazily written and I want my $6 back! Lol",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

It quickly became apparent that they must have had a problem finding a script writer as the job could only have been done by a seventh grader (actually I think I may be doing the seventh graders a disservice by saying that?).Every action sequence is punctuated with multiple words like 'run, run, run' or 'hide, hide, hide' not to mention 'Thomas, Thomas, Thomas' or whomever the action's focus happened to be on during yet another non-gripping chase scene? I could go on but I think you you get my drift. Basically, it was like watching a poor amateur improve session down at the village hall.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
376,amcghie7-157-385611,Prepare to be disappointed.,1,30 September 2015,"A lot of this film quite generally did not make sense. For example, it just is not explained why there was a point in the maze in the first movie if they were just going to harvest all of the children anyway. Also why was WICKED actively working against other groups which were trying to work towards their goal? Also, parts of the film it looked like they'd just stolen it straight out of 'I am Legend'. The movie also just seemed a bit tiring of Thomas just being generally an annoying character who constantly made radical decisions and everyone to just accept. The scene where the lightening strikes were bad also, it literally shocked one of the main characters for him to be unconscious for only a couple of minutes and to regain consciousness and act like nothing happened whatsoever.Its things like this that leads this film to just seem like they've tried to make what is clearly a filler movie more exciting by adding in ridiculous scenes. It left me cringing all the way though.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
377,Tharert,Awesomity or Disgrace?,7,22 September 2015,"So, I am actually one of those who loved The Maze runner, so I was totally looking forward for its next episode. And when it came I was so happy. The movie itself was great, the camera, the environment(again epic) or even the actors were great. So it got so much that I decided to start reading the books. And when I started to read, the movies started to fade into fog. When I finished first book and kinda started comparing it to movie...well there were differences, but not that much of em'. But well some great and epic things were left in the movies. I loved the movie but now it seemed like they didn't think through it well and because of that some things in movie did not make a reason. But when I finished the second book after watching Scorch trials in cinema. well. The movie compared to book is just horrible. I know that there should be differences between movies and books, but when they wear same title the differences should be minimal and they should be for good. But I can say with certainty you start reading the books and they are totally about something different. That thing just stabbed my heart. But if don't take the movies as adaptation of Dashners books..then they are really cool.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
378,harry-jensen16,It achieves what it sets out to do.,4,18 September 2015,"Having read the books, I noticed a lot that didn't match, felt wrong and didn't make sense as a whole. But this review won't focus on that, rather the movie as a movie. It was not a good one. It is your stock standard teen action film with all the necessary characters and events. It has your hero, your unlikely sidekick, the unrequited love interest. It introduced nothing new and to somebody who loves movies, is quite forgettable. With absolutely no character development I found myself not really caring what happened to any of them. Especially with all the secrecy and unanswered questions. Throughout the film there are COUNTLESS moments where somebody asks a question, ""Where are we going?"" ""What do you mean? ""Who are you?"" ""What's going on?"" Instead of answering the other character merely says something like, ""you'll see."" or ""it doesn't matter."" News flash! It does matter. How can we be connected to the film when nothing is explained or understood? We know there are 'cranks,' what are they? Zombies? Maybe. All we know is that they chase you. They have dangled some action in front of our faces and expected us to bite. I know that this is a young adults movie and it doesn't aim to be ground breaking or thought provoking. But action scenes are only good when we know what's at stake and why its happening. We need to care about the characters and be engaged with the story. If the same writers are used for the final installment of this film, don't get your hopes up for a nice end monologue or good meaning, because they won't deliver.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
379,carterjoe88,Worst piece of garbage to ever come from a book adaption,1,24 December 2015,"The Maze runner was at least tolerable as a movie, it held enough of the story to actually make sense of having the same name. This installment however threw any idea of sense out the window. There was next to none in the relation of story events between the book and movie, and what they did have was completely and utterly butchered. The most you could even claim to have any relation to the book are the character names and that's it. And this isn't just a failure as an adaption but as a movie plot in general. Basically this is what happened, they were too lazy to bother making any of the original story coherent for the transition from page to screen let alone come up with a decent story to continue the adaption they started with the first one. And as a result some idiot decided that they would just use the creatures from The Last of Us video game and hope that they had enough mindless running that nobody would notice that there's no story at all. The writers for this movie should be shot, just to do the world the favor of not having films only for those so simple that they don't realize they're being made even more ignorant having watched it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Had me on the edge of my seat and I really liked the actors. I've read some other reviews, however, and a lot of people are really upset.This is mainly because apparently the movie diverged very far from the book. Well, I can see how that might be really frustrating since a lot of people came to see the book brought to the big screen, not some other story under the same name.However, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I didn't read the book, so I can't say if it's better or worse. All I can tell you is that I was entertained for all of it. It's not going to be remembered as a masterpiece, but I'll remember it as a really good watch.

I got all hyped up watching the trailer and thought it looked really awesome. I have not read the books yet, but the first film was promising so I was excited to see what would happen. But the movie itself was just kind of ~ meh. It was an obvious filler for the next one. As most trilogies are, I guess. Though I truly wanted for this to be something more commendable because I love the cast, and I am into the whole dystopian sci-fi setting (plus zombies.. or ""cranks""-that's what they call 'em anyway.) I know, I know, the whole genre is a bit repetitive by now. But even their performance was not enough to bring me to the edge of my seat.

It might be possible that other stories from other bad movies have been thrown in as fillers. Hard to say why something this senseless would be made. Its a great travesty for those that paid full price at t theater to watch it. It could be seen as a bad ""B"" movie on a rainy day with nothing to do.

When you think every thing is ruined, a good thing happens and when you think life is good, every thing just break over your head. Many people in the movie theater, including me, enjoyed the movie. If you go the movies only to watch something like Birdman, this is not a right choice for you.

The suspense of not knowing what was going on, that drove the reading of all the books was not sustained. They managed to explain almost everything there is to explain in a bunch of scenes that were simply created out of the thin air. It really felt like nobody read the book! Really!

I kind of wanted to at least have 45 minutes of them in the place they were dropped off to from the first book, but they left quite quickly.

Violence and apocalyptic scenes aren't enough. Is there anything else there, besides that? This is a mixture of couple of ""hot"" series and is obviously made for kids, but can it be enough?! It's a shame if it can! Special effects, shooting, fighting, zombies, blood, diseases, horror world of tomorrow, of course, saved by teenager, LOL... Where does it end?

This movie really exceeded my Expectations, and I'm sure it will exceed yours to. At some points from the beginning, there are little tiny bit of disappointments I have felt, but, I realized later that, that disappointments are nonsense! 'cause in the end it was a very good movie. The movie will make your jaws hang open, It's full of non-stop action and thrilling scenes that'll make you say, ""oh, I think I haven't breathed for minutes"". It's full of mysteries and suspense, they might give you goose bumps if you have read the book before watching the film. well, this is just my opinion. It was never boring, and it has a big cliffhangers. If you're doubting if you gonna watch it or not. you should watch it! It'll make your head full of mixed emotions. Believe me, This is a really great movie. go find its greatness yourself. But there's only one thing that really bugs me, the connection of the movie's title to the events. it's more like, the characters chose what they wanted to do and face the consequences, than WCKD gave trials to test them.

I was so excited for this movie and I'm going to be honest, I left the cinema fuming with anger. If you're going to create a movie based on a book, actually go by the book plot.

Apart from some clever special effects that may win over very young viewers, the film is awful. The plot line is so predictable, the characters are so stereotypical, the acting is mediocre at best, but by far the worst thing about this film, is the clichéd lines throughout. Without giving too much away, the amount of times the main characters are almost killed, however, while the person with the gun makes the classic Hollywood speech, they themselves are shot by another 'minor' character who was supposed to be a 'baddie'. The whole 2 and a quarter hours is full of badly-performed, predictable plot lines, dialogue and actions. I have never seen the first Maze Runner, however, I do not intend to, if it was anything as poor as this instalment. And from the predictable ending, it seems there is to be a third.

395,anastaciacindy,A whole new story that didn't make any sense,2,16 September 2015,"I am a fan of The Maze Runner Trilogy esp the The Scorch Trial. The second book should be the best of all three, but seriously Wes Ball? James? Is this the best you can do? Not that I hate the movie, but the story can be much better than this.One, the story is totally different from the book. It is not an adaption of the book, they are making a whole new story and the only things they adapt from the book is the name of the characters and the title. Okay, I can deal with this if the new story is at least good, but it just don't.Two, I did not see any connection line between The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials. The second installment didn't explain anything about the questions that appeared by the end of The Maze Runner movie. I don't see any connection between the two. Instead it just leaving us with more and more questions in our head. Doesn't make any sense, in some ways it looked stupid.Three, lacking of intrigues and emotional trigger. Plot is so fast, making the story runs flat and it appear to be just another full action packed mainstream zombie apocalypse movie. There's no 'stand out from the crowd' things.Four, the cranks. It is overly done and very unrealistic. What kind of virus would grow roots or veins or branches whatever you named it? Flare virus should affect brains and make people lose their sanity like a 'zombie'. This is not alien invasion movie.Five, the way Wes brings the new character into the movie can not be more careless than this. People just coming out of nowhere in the movie without proper introduction. They just popped out and follow Thomas blindly.However, still thumbs up for the actions and the nicely done setting. It is awesome and keeps me excited with the action and thriller especially the storms and thunders. They are the best part of the movie. The Scorch itself is great, I can not imagine a more catastrophic look from it. But they should consider giving the characters a more of a dry flaky skin and chapped lips look since I don't see them drink a lot.Well, I still hope that the Third installment will be much better than this, that Wes Ball somehow find a way to put the story together. Because in the third installment, I guess everyone will be busy going into the 'war' mode with Wicked, fighting for finding a cure and the world peace.

396,ashurpomare,Wes Ball - Why?,8,15 September 2015,"The Scorch Trials gives you promise from the GET! The beginning scene a short slow backdrop story interrupted by bringing the audience back up to speed with where we last left our cast in the previous film. The action scenes bring such an honest realism to them, pushing those CGI advocates to the back of the room. Despite being a YA cast, they are not short on delivering the roles they have! You can defiantly see a growth in our characters both physically and mentally. Thomas is still the assertive protagonist we all love to root on. I think the actors were pushed more to an emotional level in this film. For instance the Scorch scene that involved the death of Winston. All actors had a chance to showcase the acting ability they all possessed, as opposed to the one liners they had in the first film. One major topic I want to address is the bloody CRANKS. (Channeling my inner Newt.) I was not expecting the Cranks to be so, how would you put it, graphically disturbing? It's completely understandable how people are calling them Zombies because they are being portrayed in a like manner. But I hope we all know that they're not Zombies but are people who are at full term of the Flare Virus. The Virus and the animosity towards ones who are Immune gives us plenty of reason to why they are so flipp'n crazy! That gave this film a Horror Genre vibe that I really didn't like. It distorted the Audience Rating. The first film stood out in different ways from other movies in like Genre, mainly for its innocence. Anyone else think that the 'Finger' gesture Thomas signaled to Janson was completely unnecessary? Sadly I thought it reflected a immature personality of Thomas. Which is such a downing factor when you see him totally dominating scenes. Also the scene where Benda and Thomas go visiting the place that was obviously filled with Prostitutes and people who lack morals was so, in simple terms, weird? It made the film seem dirty and inappropriate. The film seemed split up in segments dedicated for different ages. Despite all of those things, the films entirety is gripping and a big step above its predecessor!

We all know this. It's a man-made virus which made people slowly lose their humanity and become animals. Virus. Airborne. You do NOT get a virus by getting bitten by the infected.

In favour of some root-zombies coming out of the wall.I've mentioned it previously, but Crank seems to be synonymous to Zombie.Every Crank in the movie is already far past the Gone. For those who do not understand: the Gone is when every trace of humanity within the person is lost. The dynamics of humanity deteriorating was a powerful element to the book, lost in the movie plot. #3 - WICKED..- Sorry, I mean WCKDScorch Trials was still very much a part of WCKD's plan. The idea was to study the Gladers' brains by throwing every possible scenario at them.Everything to do with WICKED in Scorch Trials is basically what happens in Death Cure. Rather than keeping us enthralled wondering if Teresa is actually on Thomas' or WCKD's side, or if Jorge is a Crank or not. Now, this may sound like a fan-girl complaining about how they did not copy the book to the point. To an extent, it is. But the scenes in Scorch Trials can be likened to any Zombie movie you want, rather than the potential hit it could be.I could make a fan movie more accurate than this shite.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I have read ALL the books and watch the first and second movie and I know that scorch trials is a bit different to the book but it's amazing it continuously draws me in.It is full and suspense and tension.I Don't CARE WHAT PEOPLE SAY but this movie was awesome one of a kind and is personally my FAVORITE movie of all time.I never knew it would be that good but it ABSOLUTELY blew me away.CRAZY BOUT THIS FILM 😘😍😍😍😍😍😍 forget everyone else this movie is BAE LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!

404,mstephens-50688,Not what your expecting,2,26 September 2015,"I found the first film interesting and the unknown added to it.This film apart from special effects just appears to be a filler. I have not read the books so wasn't expecting particulars. But just from the title Scortch trails coming after the maze trails, you would expect some sort of actual trail, instead the characters are left to do what they please. Throughout the film you are waiting for some actual backbone and link to the trail aspect but it is never forth coming. In all respects this could be on its on and not linked to a series and it may be interesting. As part of the trails series overall satisfaction is low and i wouldn't dream of going to the cinema to see the next film.I think ill read the book for this and the final book, and skip the last film.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Both walked out of the movie confused...""Where did the virus come from?"" was the first question that they asked. The beginning of the movie should have included the reason why W.I.C.K.E.D. created the Maze, explained what the Flare is, and introduced both groups of Maze runners. Instead, the audience is lost in visual effects without knowing why the action is happening. To add insult to injury, the writers turn the virus infected people into inhuman, biologically altered zombies. The immune are now a commodity for a short term fix to the virus problem. So much has been lost by these adaptations that the result is a vague and confusing zombie flick. I almost walked out.This was a wonderful book that should have been an incredible movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Turned out to be a very good movie, a lot of tension and you'd forget the actors were just teenagers. When the second movie premiered I wanted to watch it immediately because I expected the same. Unfortunately it wasn't. This movie wasn't surprising at all. The writers tried to create the same suspense, but it just failed. Everything was so predictive and the last 30 min. were just boring.

Just DON'T do both.Long version: There really are no words to describe how far away this movie was from the book. It was like going into a theater expecting to see The Terminator, and seeing Braveheart instead. Both great movies, but NOTHING similar about them. Besides the character names, lightening, and some sand, NOTHING, I repeat NOTHING about this movie resembled ANY part of the book. Nothing. I read the book in one day, two days before I saw this movie. I was so excited to see this fantastic book come to life, and I left sorely disappointed.I'm not sure if the author of the book was involved at all in the decisions that went into the writing of this movie, but they completely bastardized, completely changed EVERYTHING about his story. Even the core motivation behind the 'who and the why' was different.It simply was not the same story at all. I've seen many books made into movies and I'm familiar with the huge and often disappointing changes they inevitably make, but this was off the charts. I've never seen anything like it.If you haven't read the books, then go see it. It was fun enough.

409,football_fanatic,Not part of the Maze Runner Trilogy,1,5 October 2015,"I was disappointed enough with the first Maze Runner movie and how much of the story the writers and director had changed, however the general basis was still pretty much the same. The same cannot be said for this movie.The entire plot-line is completely different, it doesn't explain anything about what has happened, what is going on now, and what the kids have to do, it has essentially been made into yet another zombie movie. This was summed up by my girlfriend who hasn't read the books being completely confused as to what is going on.I understand that there are parts of books that are always changed to make a movie, however there is so little in this from the book that it shouldn't even be associated with it, I can't see how it was even signed off by the author.In summary, I wouldn't bother with this movie, if you have read the books you will just be pointing out all of the things that are different from when you read it, and if you haven't read the book you won't have a clue what is going on.

It jumps from scene to scene without enough plot to give the audience a sufficient sense of appreciation as to why the characters are doing what they do. I could hardly believe it when the movie ended, 2 hours wasted on what could have been time playing ""left 4 dead 2"" and still leaving me with the same feeling - the 'that was thrilling but a complete waste of time' feeling. I'm going to keep this a short and simple, almost lazy review. Because that is exactly how I feel about this movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

412,eeveecorgi,"James Dashner, Wes Ball and T.S. Nowlin owe the readers an apology!!!",1,6 October 2015,"*Warning, contains spoilers. Only read this review if you have read the books and seen both movies..*I went into 'The Scorch Trials' expecting the worst since 'Maze Runner' did such a horrible job with the story already. I didn't expect it to be this awful. Why even bother making a book into the movie if you are not even going to follow any of the story line? This movie had nothing to do with the books, first off I have a question for Nowlin (the screenplay writer) why call it the 'Scorch Trials' if there was no TRIAL?? The book had a trial that the kids had to pass; this movie had a bunch of kids escaping WCKD and running around in a desert. There was nothing that was remotely a trial about it. This movie had me so angry my eyes got watery and I had a migraine.Look, as someone who reads a lot of novels I understand that movies can't perfectly portray the books, but to have the audacity to take these fun, enthralling novels and turn them into a down-graded action pile of garbage, that's insulting to the readers. Any person I know who read the books and saw the movie was absolutely insulted and astonished.Let's focus on the movie flaws here for a moment in case you're wondering why I am so angry... ( if you care) 1.) Why do we already know about the Right Arm in this movie?? That's not until the third book. 2.) Why wasn't this a trial? What was so wrong with the MAIN plot of the book that you turned into a movie? 3.) Why did the cranks have roots? The cranks were supposed to have levels of being gone which made them interesting and not just a bunch of cgi, moronic monsters. 4.)Why was Thomas and Theresa incapable of having telepathy? 5.)How is it that all of them are immunes but Winston was killed immediately after a bite? 6.)Why was the scorch a desert? The scorch is supposed to be an unbearable terrain where you cant survive for long, it's supposed to show how badly the Flare effected the earth. 7.)Why did Nowlin feel that Thomas having 'killed by group B' written on his neck wasn't a fantastic edge-of-your-seat piece of the novel? I guess since he skimmed the book and decided to write his own story he threw all of the exciting and mysterious concepts of the novel out the window and make it a movie of running around not doing anything with any real substance.I really need those questions answered because my mind is actually blown, I cannot believe that the Director and Screenplay writer had the guts to call this movie 'The Maze Runner Series'I have two positives about the movie though. 1.) The actors were absolutely fantastic who ever cast this movie was probably the only one who read the books. That's what is super sad about this movie is the casting was great, but the story was absolute garbage. It looked like the actors read the books, and the director read the cliff notes. 2.) The visuals were gorgeous, it's too bad that I was focused on the failures of the writing.The craziest part about this series is if they had followed the books at least with the main plot lines and twists, this movie would have been bigger than 'The Hunger Games', but they decided to drop this awful movie onto the readers and make them suffer.James Dashner, as far as I have read in your interviews you were okay with this?? You owe your readers the BIGGEST apology ever! You sold yourself out for the cash, and I was going to read your other series but my friends and I will not touch anything you've written until we receive an apology for getting us hooked on your novels, and then approving this awful movie that had nothing to do with your books besides the character names and the title. Your books had so much more complexity to the story and the writer/director of the movie decided not to use any of your actual plot line. Doesn't that make you angry even a little bit?Wes Ball, T.s. Nowlin and James Dashner. Shame on all three of you. If you've read the books please avoid this movie like the plague. If you haven't read the books ( you shouldn't be reading my review lol) but if you accidentally did please read the books, and skip this awful movie. I could have covered at least 10 more disappointing points about this film, but no one wants to read a 20 paragraph review, this review was long enough. James Dashner, I await your apology for doing this to your readers.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
413,snowwhitemirage,Disappointed and irritated,2,6 October 2015,"I recommend any and all who have respect for a writers work and/or have ever read the maze runner series, don't watch the second movie. It was a good movie but it should not have been released under the title scorch trials as it had no relevance what's so ever to the second book or the trials themselves, which is literally the title. I am very disappointed/Very much irritated. The only resemblance to the book was the character names. This also felt like a very sore excuse for a zombie movie instead of having the proper and well thought out story line that manipulated the characters like originally intended. Overall, I say again the movie would be fine on its own with no relation whatsoever with the series but because it is in fact based off of a book series I am very disappointed to see they threw the whole series aside and made up their own story. Very disappointed, I cannot say that enough times.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
414,fannyjohansson,Exciting adventure and sci-fi movie,7,8 October 2015,"""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials"" is the sequel to last year's popular movie ""The Maze Runner."" In the first movie, a group of teenagers are caught in a maze, not knowing why and how they got there. In the end of the film, a couple of people from the group, including the main character Thomas, successfully escape from the maze and this is where the second movie takes off. In the beginning of ""Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,"" Thomas and the rest of the group who successfully escaped the maze in the first movie have been rescued and soon discover that they are not the only ones who escaped from the maze, but there are several other groups of teenagers who escaped from other mazes and have been rescued by the same people as Thomas' group. All of the people that were rescued are gathered in a place that is supposed to be safe from the outside world where a virus is spreading among humans, which turns them into zombie-like creatures. Although it seems like the group is finally safe, it is not long before they discover that something is not right and realize that the people who rescued them are not who they claim to be. On Thomas' initiative, a small group escapes from the supposedly safe place, out in the real world where they encounter zombies and other obstacles in the journey of finding people that still haven't been infected by the virus that can help them. The movie definitely contains a lot of actions and unexpected turns that will keep the audience awake. The storyline, however, can be somewhat confusing if the audience is not paying attention. Since the movie falls into the science fiction genre, it is based on a made- up world and for the audience to fully understand the storyline they have to pay attention to how things are connected in this world. In the movie, most of the characters are teenager who are, unlike the world they are living in, regular teenagers, which makes the characters both very believable and relatable. They don't necessarily go through a lot of changes throughout the movie; they rather learn more about the surrounding world and why certain things are happening. The story, overall, is very innovative, which makes it very interesting and fun to watch. When it comes to the setting of the movie I was very impressed. Most of the movie takes place in what used to be regular cities but which are now completely deserted because of the spreading virus. The abandoned cities are destroyed and spooky, which really sets the mood of the whole movie and fits perfectly in with the zombie-creatures that are haunting the cities. Another thing that really contributed to certain scenes in the movie was the sound and the music, which added on intensity to many of the already intense scenes in the movie. The acting was also very good. Most of the actors were not very famous before the first movie of the ""Maze Runner"" series came out but many of them probably received a lot of publicity after the first movie aired.Since ""Maze Runner: Scorch Trials"" is a sequel to ""The Maze Runner,"" I would have wished that the sequel would have been better connected to the first movie. In the first movie, the audience was left in the dark in many places of the story and the ideal would have been if the story of the sequel explained these things, which in some cases, it didn't. For example, the full story on how the maze in the first movie benefited anybody is still very unclear. ""Maze Runner: Scorch Trials"" is an adventurous movie for teenagers and adults, but maybe not for the easily frightened. The movie is engaging and exciting and because of the way it ended, a third movie can soon be expected.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
415,tlrieder,Worst movie I have EVER SEEN.,1,10 October 2015,"HOLY COW I want my money back, you know what, I WANT PAID FOR THAT Experience!!Did the screenwriter even see the previous movie. DID ANYONE WATCH IT IN EDITING! NO, they didn't. The only review I could imagine they did was a checklist of cliché movie components and threw it all together.""Spoilers""(although you cant spoil this movie)Underdog Protagonist check, Antagonist check, Actors check, Bad guys check, Aliens check, Zombies check, Helicopters check, Rebels check, Mystery check, Stupid love triangle CHECK, Post apocalyptic setting check, Plot....................does not compute.Where to begin, I created an account here just for this little gem of a movie. If I had to pick one word to describe this movie it would be, inconsistent-worthless-garbage. Yea the plot doesn't exist, Dr Suess makes more sense, literally I am serious. From what I can fathom the main premise of the movie is, the bad guys want to harvest the blood of some teenagers for a short acting vaccine to fight a virus/disease that decimated the world. And they do this by building HUGE elaborate facilities that would literally take BILLIONS of man hours to construct. Then we take those kids and throw them in one where they are LITERALLY SLAUGHTERD by the facilities and ALIENS or mutants or whatever they are cuss no one EVEN THINKS TO ASK, I am sorry but this movie is so terrible someone should consider a class action lawsuit to get our money back. I am just gonna leave it at that before my blood pressure gets out of hand. Ow and this is coupled with literally dozens of other inconsistent sub plots or story points or whatever I don't think trash has a proper name in literary terminology.My favorite scene the kid breaks into the teleconference/teenager blood harvesting room, that incidentally doubles as the aliens/mutant in a test tube holding facility, AND Doesn't MENTION THE FRIGGIN ALIEN MUTANT THINGS and acts like they ain't even there, ARE YOU SERIOUS and who decided the teleconferencing room should be in the blood harvesting room seriously fire that guy.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
416,mreeuss,Nothing like the first movie.,3,11 October 2015,"I went into it expecting a movie like the first one. The sense of mystery, the fear of the unknown as we gradually discover clues about the nature of the maze and the characters' past is what captured me.Unfortunately The Scorch Trials is nothing like that. No mystery, no plot, no character development, not even answers to questions set by the first movie. Instead all I got was endless chase scenes - by gruesome zombie knock-offs (so original), by mad scientists and their henchmen, by sandstorms, by thunderstorms -, cliché gunfights and the characters moving from one place to another without any real purpose. Characters from the first movie (except Thomas) fade into the background, while new characters end up forgettable as they hop into fights without a proper introduction. Plot is pushed aside in favor of action, which while somewhat exciting, becomes repetitive by the end of the film and doesn't offer anything that hasn't been done a multitude of times already.If you're looking for a generic sci-fi/zombie movie full of mindless action you might wanna give it a try, but if you expect anything more than that you will be disappointed.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I think this franchise was trying to compete with the hobbit on how badly you can offend a fandom by commercializing it. But at least the hobbit still followed the same arch, it was just heavily nourished.you could still recognized the universe. Scorch trials left the galaxy and traveled over to the resident evil universe after stopping by Jurassic park and twister galaxies. I won't be seeing the third as this has nothing to do with the franchise I liked.I understand that the scorch trials book is a good read but would not have adapted to a good movie, but to turn a science experiment into resident evil ruined the whole point of the books, that the kids depended on one another, And never had a clue what was going on.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I've noticed a lot of reviews talk about how absurd it is, with zombies, shooting and all of that stuff. In my opinion, yes it may seem quite off-topic when you're watching a movie about teens who are trying to find out what is happening with the world. However, all these features of the Scorch Trials seemed so natural and well written in the book, and not just like ideas which were there because they couldn't come up with anything else. for some reason this movie is missing at least half of the important details and scenes that occurred in the book, which made it much more interesting and mysterious. They decided to go with the ""Let's put in less detail, and more action"" approach, which clearly didn't work out.

The acting of every actors and actresses was awesome here. With Thomas already established, Ball and O'Brien are able to evolve and develop their starring hero a bit more for The Scorch Trials. Instead of a brave ""new guy"" cliché, this round O'Brien is able to explore what exactly makes Thomas such a capable and compassionate leader. Viewers left pining for answers after The Maze Runner's climactic cliffhanger, will find The Scorch Trials also adds much-appreciated context to the Glader's former association with W.C.K.D. – painting a much clearer picture of why Thomas is a hero (both inside of the maze and out in the real world).Unfortunately, as O'Brien steps into the spotlight, developing Thomas into a layered paragon, the remainder of The Scorch Trials cast is sidelined. Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden) are reduced to expository sounding boards for Thomas and other dialogue- heavy characters – rather than capable heroes who possess individual skills necessary to the group's survival. Fan-favorite Minho gets a few moments to shine but, like the majority of Scorch Trials characters, most often he's simply looking to Thomas to call the next shot.

423,bucchr,Save yourself and your loved ones from this atrocity,1,4 November 2015,"I abhor this movie. It's like some kind of amateur attempt at boring you to death with a movie - which to their credit is almost achieved. The run time is 131 minutes. Do you have any idea how long that is? It's more than 2 hours. It's 2 hours and 11 minutes. That is the equivalent of 9% of your day, 12% if you sleep for a reasonable 6 hours. Every single character makes terrible choices. This applies to both the protagonists and antagonists. For example the good guys take the long road to some mountains, they run in a lightning storm, and when they see bad things happening they sort of chill for a while and kinda let the horror grow on them. Then once their faces decide they can now display the emotion that the situation has reared from incubation through tween years, adulthood and eventually rotten old age, they decide to run away. Most of them are pretty good at this except for one middle eastern looking guy who gets bitten and then commits suicide. Also the bob-haircut woman who is a person the rest of the crew have only just met but suddenly wish to keep alive more than being in a better movie.There is just no character development.The action sequences were the most boring thing I've ever watched. Unfortunately I streamed this movie instead of downloading it like usual. This meant that I couldn't double the playback speed like I can in vlc. I'm actually glad I didn't download it because now I don't have to delete itYou cant want it for the plot because there is none, nor can you ""watch it for the plot"" if you know what I mean, because there's none of that either.Overall a terrible movie with a pitiful story line and sad sequences. 1/10 do not recommend.

And where did the fuel come from for the helicopters and vehicles? Where did the power for the medical center come from? How could there be video communication? You can either see this as a terrible waste of $10 or you can see it as unintentionally spoofing every other movie of wasted society/humanity. I chose the latter, and that made it bearable.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
429,andreapradella,"Rooting for the ""bad guys""",2,16 November 2015,"I knew this movie would have been bad: I watched the first one and I already didn't like it; still, I was curious about WHY THE BUILT A FANCY KILLING MAZE for humanity's only hope??? Well, not only this movie did not answer, but it also made me wonder if in the future everyone is a complete idiot. SUGGESTIONS:1)WCKD breeds in lab the cells that produce the cure... WORLD SAVED. If you tell me we can't, for a postulated reason then...2)WCKD clones a random immune thousand times and harvests him in a coma state. WORLD SAVED but, say we postulate again we can't do it...3)WCKD harvests as the ""good"" guys: not in lab but by blood sampling.. DONE! But this is not fast enough so it's going to be the hard way (I'd be like: ""yeah, I like that the movie explained that!"" So everything happens as normal)4)The CRAZY STUPID heroes that would anyway sacrifice themselves by exploding or by suicide missions decide it would be better ""ending"" their lives to save millions in WCKD labs.5)In ANY case... Carry the weapons!!! DO NOT leave them with the corpses!Lastly, how are the good guys expecting to get things better?! At least WCKD is trying.P.S. I'm only talking about the ""plot"" here, I know that this is a crappy teenager movie: acting, tactical and physics errors aren't to be considered (even though there is plenty, right, Fury???)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
430,enyinayaokafor,Deteriorated,2,17 November 2015,"1. Long without a point: You don't shoot a movie for +2hours without capturing your audience for a split second. That's just against every rule of movie-making and such is only allowed if you have a sophisticated plot twist at the end that would make everyone itch their heads. 2. Acting not up to par: Facial expressions didn't capture a lot, for people who were running for their lives. 3. Poor continuity: just substituting cyborg spiders for ""cranks"" and a maze for the glades didn't make much sense. No appeal whatsoever, just the random story everyone is used to. Senseless running which made it hard to catch up with the movie 4. Sequel: Thomas, the hero. As the movie drew to a conclusion, after the whole rant about a safe haven, Thomas decides to go back to save his friend. Wow. Another story for a third sequel, everyone is out to make money now affecting the purity of the story. 5.Bad script : phrases like ""We are almost there"", ""common, let's go"" drowned the movie.Good job the sound effects, as that's the only part I could find commendations for the movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
431,jadeloxar,Better than the first one,8,17 November 2015,"The Scorch Trials, being the second part of The Maze Runner series, takes part after where the first movie adaptation left off. This second movie now focuses on the Glader's life outside of the maze, shortly after they have escaped. Facing a new challenge of exploring the world beyond the maze, the Gladers were bewildered at what awaits them at the truly outside world.As an audience who have read and finished the series, I can say I'm quite impressed with the adaptation. Though some scenes may differ from the book, most of them were adjusted for the better. I can understand where the complaints ""The movie isn't like the book"" come from, but having to shape a writer's imaginations into real life actions require some changes, which would only be normal for a movie that originates from a science fiction creation. The casting would be a little challenging, but the outcome was accurate enough. The animations in this movie is a little better than the first movie, in which I'm guessing the crew's improved. The story takes place in a scorch, which would be a little tricky to find a location that's suitable, but the deserted land shown in the movie works just fine in my opinion.They continued to surprise me with the cranks. The cranks were well made and well portrayed, it's that one part of the movie that impresses me the most. The animations of the cranks met my expectations, which is saying a lot because I'm the type to have high hopes. As the Gladers went on their journey in search of a place called ""Safe haven"", there were challenging obstacles in their way. During some scenes, their solutions weren't quite what I was expecting, I could clearly see a smarter way to get out of the problems. The main protagonist, Thomas, acts a little too recklessly at times, which tends to drag his friends into danger. With sacrifices made along the way, the Gladers were once again chased down by the WCKD, and I wished Thomas would do as much as to stop and think before he acts, rather than letting his feelings take over and acted upon it.The character developments of Thomas in this movie weren't that significant, but there are a few scenes in which Thomas had to make hard decisions. And he did it right, which surprises me because it shows that he had matured up.The fight between humans and cranks are by far my favorite. Humans are a little dominant with their speed, but they were ridiculously outnumbered. Knowing that they have now stepped into the crank's complete territory, the Gladers kept running. When they were chased down by the WCKD, which indicates the climax of the movie, that part truly shook me. Though I feel like the story focuses on Thomas too much, and even though his development is a little slow, Thomas made a heroic decision at the falling action after they had been captured once again by the WCKD. He vowed to never leave his friends behind, even when they told him to run. Even when they insisted, the phrase ""I'm tired of running"" made me like him a little bit more. The story is completely packed with actions, and it is far more dynamic and eventful compared to the first one.I've seen this twice in the theaters, and I've enjoyed it. I liked it despite the flaws I pointed out, I'll give this movie a good rating. It's done its job of making you curious, which means they'll be making more money when the third part comes out next year. What a bait.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
432,danm-29463,Would have been nice if the director and writers had looked at the book,1,20 November 2015,"What can I say, The Maze Runner was a well paced well written and well directed movie which even though it did move away from the book in some details was similar enough for anyone who read the book to enjoy it.This is not that movie. The Scorch trials was an enjoyable read continuing the story of the Gladers and their struggle with WICKED or WCKD(for movie people). My major problem with the movie adaption is that the director and writers appear not to have read it. Other than character and some place names there is almost no similarity at all. I am wondering if the director was looking for a job on The Walking Dead as this would be the only way to explain to me why a non-zombie book could be turned into a zombie holocaust movie. The director saying this movie moves a little away from the book story line is like saying that Alabama is Next door to Sydney I for one can't see how the story can be moved back in line for the next one.While I can understand some creative differences and the need for movies to change story lines for continuity and time constraints it seems that in this case the fact the the Scorch Trials being another test for the Survivors of the TWO Mazes (yes there were TWO in the books one for boys with one girl arriving at the end and one for girls with one boy arriving at the end not many). Also that the Gladers were told about the test and its rules before being transferred to the Scorch and the tattoos and meaning of them. Makes this not continuation of the Maze Runner story but a zombie holocaust movie for teens.Good luck to the director with the Death Cure and I hope you can make the time to read the book before filming it.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I still do not understand what the maze trials were for. All the kids were merely playing ""Daniel Defoe""in part one and why Thomas had to be mute whenever Paige or Teresa would give the greater good speech. I was hoping he will have some nice answer. Anyways, the movie was overall OK OK and I wont remember it for weeks. I am not going to watch the part three for sure.

Just little things that people in this situation probably wouldn't have done. For instance during the escape from the wicked facility Thomas walks towards the people trying to stop their escape only putting more distance between him and the large door he must exit. I also couldn't stand when the Brit kid would ask what's your plan or where are we going to Thomas. Really?

However, I was let down by pretty much all the film.I think the writers just decided that because zombie films/series' are 'in' at the moment they should introduce them into this film to try and inflate the income.The reason I loved Maze Runner is that it stood out from most movies today and felt new, fresh and vibrant.The storyline was flat, it didn't feel like a 'trial' and the whole movie felt empty to me, a blank canvass compared to its prequel Mona Lisa.I wish I could get that 2hr 11mins back of my life and invest that time better, I certainly won't be investing anymore time in future releases of this franchise.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

441,podostro,"Wrong script, mass factured zombie flick",4,13 December 2015,"This is not me defending James Dashner books, after what he did with the third book ""Death Cure""... I won't be reading anymore of his books, ever.But this movie is bad on it's own accord. As a Zombie flick, it's barely passable. As an adaptation from a book? It doesn't even deserve the ""based on"" legend in the credits...The Maze Runner had a few changes from the book, which I found acceptable due to the time constraints in a movie...But ""Scorch Trials"" have less than 10% common content with the book.For starters, they replaced the psychological drama of the human species as whole, degrading to barely thinking animals; due to an airborne virus afflicting anyone and everywhere. With a blood infection virus that turns you zombie like... They even put at least two scenes which seems taken right out of the game ""The last of us"". Even the shrieks seem a homage to the clicker's sounds..The world has been scorched by a solar flare, and the ""scorch"" is a zone where the temperatures rises to intolerable highs; yet in the movie the kids get barely dehydrated from traversing a desert...The whole point of ""The scorch trial"" is to continue testing the kids minds to figure out how the virus attacks it, and find a way to stop it; in the movie, it's only the movie's title. They already figured it's an enzyme, which could or could not be a cure, and use them as a non renewable source for harvesting it ...They mixed in the ""immune gathering"" from the third book just for measure, and took away the concept of WICKED always watching over and controlling the kids from the shadows...And not to mention there's not a single mention to scientific breakthroughs part of the history: i.e: The head eating molten hot, semi autonomous, liquid metal ball. The teleporting wall. The invisible force fields. The life saving medical advances... None of it is in there.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

Now I'm not ignorant, I know Hollywood tends to distort details and such but for the most part, they at least stick with the story. That being said, this movie is an embarrassment. First off, they don't ""escape"". They stay in the facility for a few days and wake up one morning with everyone gone. They figure out that WICKED is messing with them again and WICKED literally tells them ""Hey, you all have he virus, if you want the cure, go to the mountains and get it""... That's it. That's the second trial. Going to get the cure. Otherwise the Title doesn't make freaking sense! Don't you think that's vital to the original plot? Teresa isn't supposed to be with them, there is no rebel alliance, this movie is stupid! I mean the virus is supposed to make you go insane, not turn you into a raging monster! It's like the creators of the movie just don't care. Look if you want to make a bad movie fine. But don't put the name of a really good book on it, and slaughter it.

I would read the books again and again but I won't even be watching this film again.If you enjoyed the first film I would recommend the books as there are a lot more interesting things that happen in the rest of the series.

444,janettexia,I signed up to IMDb to write a review cos this film is just crap,3,8 January 2016,"First off, unlike all the other negative reviews, I found the plot okay, as I didn't read the book. But I did watch the first part, which was pretty good and like all good films, left loads of questions open. In this part the most basic questions are still not answered properly, Thomas' and Theresa's past at WCKED is mention occasionally but I still have no idea why they made a maze, why the virus even broke out, who exactly WCKED plans to save (?) by killing teens? And why do they work with teens when children have most fluid? This film is completely illogical, for example, it is explained that children's brains produce an enzyme that is immune, which cannot be manufactured, which is why WCKED kinda collects teens (but why the maze? To test their IQ?): to drain the fluid. But I mean there has to be a more effective way right? For example, they could pair the immune teens up and make them make immune babies or sthm. And what is the point in killing bunches of people so other people get to live a few months longer? I wouldn't call that saving the human race. Whats worse though, is the characters. It's like when one shines light on zombie humans for the 3rd time, making them awaken and aggressive, one would start running instead of standing there, still illuminating them, waiting for the zombies to untangle themselves and chase after you. Also, seeing its the 3rd time you switch the light on and zombies awaken, you should have grasped that they are attracted to light. And why zombies anyway? They turned this movie into a zombie apocalypse with shitty characters. The characters are so annoying dumb and have no logic at all!!! For example, at the end when one friend is taken, Thomas decides to get him and destroy wcked in the process... How reasonable is that?! Additionally, Theresa, the girl, tells Thomas on several occasions that she wants to go back cos she believes wcked is good, but he just doesn't get that Theresa's on wcked's side and will sell them out. Take a hint will ya? Or another example: one guy gets bitten and is really weak the next day. Everyboby is concerned, but nobody thinks of checking the actual wound till he collapses. I honestly have no idea how I finished this movie, in some ways I do wanna know how it ends because I like the characters from the 1. Part (this one ruined them though), but I certainly nearly stopped numerous times.

I have read all the books so I expect the movie to be at least a little like them. but no. they decided to use the same characters but a whole different story line. Did they think that the people who read the books would just be fine with it? I am sure that people who haven't read the books will find this movie kind of interesting, but even if I hadn't read the books, I still wouldn't have liked it. It would have been so much better if they had just stuck with the books. I hated this movie so much. it was the crappiest thing I have ever seen and no one should watch it. besides it is called ""the scorch trials"" for a reason. It isn't supposed to be about them escaping from wicked (which is how it supposed to be written but in the movie it spells it without the I for some reason) it is supposed to be about them going through another trial as the name says. wicked sent them on this mission so that they could see how the kids brains reacted to the variables. and what is with the people who have the flare? why are there zombies? this movie is so confusing and stupid. and what is with Minho being taken away at the end? this movie is totally nothing like the book.

447,chupy-09296,"Looks nice, but lacking logic, development and cohesion.",4,25 January 2016,"As someone who found The Maze Runner reasonably enjoyable, I was disappointed to find that The Scorch Trials failed to improve upon its predecessor in any tangible way. I haven't read the books, so plot deviations were not important. PLOT DETAILSWe pick up where we left off in The Maze Runner - and I had high hopes that once the boys and girl were 'rescued' we would get some answers. But this film only raises more questions. I realise that it's setting up for a third in the trilogy but there's no direction. All we know is that WCKD is bad and the kids are running from them. Nothing about the Flare virus, the characters' motives etc. is explained. The kids are taken in by Janson (well played by the sinister Aidan Gillen) and it's an obvious 'too good to be true' scenario. They promptly escape thanks to new character Aris and make their way across the desert (the aptly named Scorch). This is where the film's scenery and set pieces shine - the dystopia setting and dilapidated buildings are gorgeous. But the veneer of good CGI doesn't make up for the lack of logic in many character decisions. For example, Winston is clawed by a 'crank' (a human with the Flare virus, the film's generic zombie) and the wound is not looked at by anyone until he collapses. Does no-one care about him? And (SPOILER) when Teresa betrays the group at the end, how does she communicate with WCKD? How does WCKD find them?! Another thing I found annoying was a distinct lack of character development. There is no progress - they are the same characters as at the end of The Maze Runner. New characters are introduced: Jorge and Brenda (Giancarlo Esposito and Rose Salazar) are hostile and change to the kids' side far too readily. Vince, leader of the Right Arm, is the token tough guy. The cinematography was irritating. Far too many dimly lit running scenes with shaky camera and on-screen torches really ruin any promising action sequences. And what is with characters standing still while the people in danger are yelling at them to run away? Nonsense. Also a shame is the generic 'zombies', victims of the Flare virus. There was plenty of room for originality here but they went for basic uninspired zombies.All in all, a disappointment. Worth a watch if you want to turn your brain off for a while. 4/10.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials

I read your article because I had the same questions and comments about this movie. In essence it was a high budget C-Movie with about as much thought as an elementary school kid's home movie. . I really enjoyed the concept of the first maze runner and was hoping the plot holes and questions could be answered and maintained throughout the sequels,.. such as a Hunger Games, etc... What happened was a movie that was labeled maze runner turned into a non-maze runner zombie/teen flick. This could of even been somewhat obtainable if they didn't just say screw us throughout and not give a damn about any story-line. continuity.Here's a list of the messes just off the top of my head: The kids obtained random weapons that we never saw them acquire. - One of their own ""immune"" got infected by the very virus the story says they were harvesting them to fight against,... AND NO MENTION!!!!!?????? - Amazing journey across the scorched land with no water. - If WICKD knew where they were going then they would of easily been picked up in the desert. - Why did Thomas act like he had unknown affection for sad sack Teresa when he kisses Brenda, who then becomes offended (she likes him??), only to later on admit Thomas reminds her of her brother?!?!? WTF?!?! - Additionally the whole WICKD management thing is all disjointed and suffers from identity crisis. Jansen is good, he's bad,.. Dr Ava is dead, she's alive, she's helping, she's a female Hitler,... it's all nonsense. - And why all the unneeded robot spiders to figure this stuff out??!? HOW ABOUT JUST SAVE MONEY AND GRAB KIDS TO TEST THEM TO SEE IF THEY'RE IMMUNE!?!?!?This essentially is a C-Movie planning department that somehow got a A-Movie budget due to success of Hunger Game, Divergent, etc.... Again, I really liked the whole idea of the Maze changing and the kids figuring it out, even with the holes in the first movie but Scorch Trials this just killed any form of confidence that I could have in the producers of this movie, that anything or anyone will come together and make sense. They should really thank Hunger Games for getting this debacle off the ground and having jobs until this mess if finished.

I really was looking forward to the end but it was nothing....NOTHING like the book.I know that books are more likely to be better than movies and this was a prime example. Justawful. Sure throw in some of the one liners and quotes from the book but they did not follow the plot of the book.But the is how it goes, take someone else's idea like a song or book and change it so it's different enough were you won't get in trouble and make money off it. Right? BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
453,junobuglover,Worst film ever !,1,27 March 2016,"*Spiloer* The first maze runner was kind of boring but I sat through it and at the end was actually hooked. I couldn't wait to watch the second so I immediately rented it for six bucks. Oh how I wish I had seen these reviews. At the end I was left with a headache from being so confused and tired it was a two hour movie ! Full of poop ! Cgi zombies, kids getting drunk or high off some liquid, weird movie just stick to the books ! My eyes hurt, I'm tired. I can't believe I watched this still why ? God why ? I hope sleep will make me forget this poop of a movie. Horrible movie. Horrible plot. Scattered confused headache. Such a waste of sight just a poop.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
454,crystalsolly,not really any point in saying contains spoilers because i cant as this is not the movie i read the book to!,2,19 April 2016,"i have to say being one of the people to actually read the book unlike the people who made this movie, i am very disappointed. for one why is Teresa in it? was she going to miss out on a pay check? she is supposed to be in it for like 5 minutes in a dingy house, kiss Thomas and then tell him to leave. other than that there is supposed to be the telepathy between Thomas and herself that never happens. Where are the hanging dead people on the ceiling at the first place they wake up in? where is the weird silver goo that chops their heads off? where are the monsters they have to fight? where are the pods they have to climb into? why are there all these scenes that never happen and make no sense being there? whats up with Brenda? they miss out on so much character development that you have no idea who these people are! where is the crank who is half mad and 'rose took my nose'? where the hell is the entire story??????? if you have read the books don't bother watching this. it is a BIG disappointment.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
455,audreyrosemb,Horrible Representation of the True Storyline,1,30 May 2016,"There's only one thing you need to know before watching this movie: It does NOT correlate with the book/true story line whatsoever. I understand there has to be some difference from written story to movie script, but the creators of this script paid no true homage to the actual plot of the book/any of its contents at all. If you haven't read the series I guess it's not as much of a loss. But as a fan of the series, this movie was actually hard to watch and I will not be seeing the third installment. I already know what happens from the books and I can't see any way they could even come back and make it semi-relatable to the books now. I love seeing the characters come to life, but some of the actor/actress choices in this movie were not even close to how they were described in the book. It was so poorly thought out and disappointing as a fan of the story. I'm not sure if the author had any say in the book to movie translation, but I feel really bad for him and how his story got twisted around. Very, very bad movie to the fan of the books.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
456,prigat-12775,For a Zombie Adventure its pretty Decent,6,30 September 2016,"Given that this Film has received so much Criticism and Negative reviews, Im here with a slight Different opinion.If U enjoy Adventure films, combined with Zombies and action you should give this one a Try. I haven't read the books, so this review is not as a Book fan, but solely Movie fan. I thought the Acting and Storyline was pretty good, I loved Brenda she reminded me of young Milla Jovovich character Alice, in Resident Evil!There were many special effects, and if you're looking for Zombie Adventure film, with action story and little romance, then this is for U !For a Film, without considering the books I think its OK.But solely as an Adventure film I enjoyed it :)",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
457,mariamooraj,A Waste Of Time,1,11 October 2016,"Congrats!! ON A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!I absolutely despised it! Wes Ball practically made an entire fandom hate him because he payed no attention to the actual story line. I was super excited for the movie, I had read all the books and these are my favorite books in the world, so I went to see the movie the night it came out... I went with my mum and dad (since I couldn't go myself, LOL) who had never read the books and I got so freaked out, we left. Later I watched the entire movie and decided it was a waste of good time. Although I think the cast acted well and were the perfect characters, the story line made no sense whatsoever. In the book, Winston dies a heroic death fighting for the rest of the Gladers, but in the movie he kills himself because he catches the Flare. The movie does not tell us anything about the real spread of the Flare by WICKED and the memories and don't even get me started on Teresa's betrayal. Her extreme betrayal in the movie has nothing to do with her betrayal in the book. Firstly, in the movie she calls WICKED to get the Gladers... NOOOOO!! She would never do that. And the Scorch Trials is TRIALS BY WICKED! Not them escaping. Teresa betrays Thomas because WICKED threatens to kill Thomas if she doesn't. She must betray him and he doesn't hate her. The Cranks in the book are not full - on zombies! I can't believe James Dashner is happy with the movies!I don't understand the plans for The Death Cure. I just wanna watch it because I love the actors and so I can make fun of it. Instead of the final trials from WICKED, from what I can tell, it's about the remaining Gladers and Thomas to go and save Minho who is taken captive by WICKED at the end. I love the books and I suggest if you are going for the movie, don't because it's a waste of money, time and brainpower. My mum walked out saying, 'so where did the Flare come from?' the question that was meant to be answered in the movie. The books are absolute gold! #fandomgoals! But the movie is a terrible representation. TO be fair, the Maze Runner movie (the first one) was good as a movie, it still had some of the book's original plot and it was quite alright. However, in contrast, the Scorch Trials is the worst movie I have ever seen.Learn from Wes Ball is you want an entire fandom to hate you, I'm sure you'll succeed.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
458,faranaksiaminamin,Maze Runner The Scorch Trials,10,6 February 2017,"I love this movie. It has somewhat similar plot to some post apocalyptic movies, yet! It keeps you on the edge of your seat at all time. It has everything for every taste, emotion, action, thriller, horror, sci-fi, comedy, adventure, and more. Made me cry, laugh, happy and sad all together. The older cast members where very good obviously, but also, the younger cast members, to me, where exceptionally amazing. Well! Most of them. I loved the technical and art work of the movie. It did give me the impression of actually feeling the tensions and/or emotions, fear or joy when the characters were going through the scenes. I definitely rate this movie 10/10 on every aspect. I had only one problem while watching it and I am not sure if it was my hearing problem or with clearly hearing the dialogues in the first 20 minutes of the movie. However, the whole composition is so good that I cannot rate it anything lower than a perfect score. I look forward for the release of the next one.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
459,immortal_019,criticism on the director of this film.,1,14 November 2015,"(criticism on the director of this film)hi,Director: Wes Ball must quit film making and should start making dramas for radio channels only. people who watch movies want to SEE something, not to imagine after seeing these type of night scenes.please do not use cameras in your next movie, use Mic only.Director: Wes Ball you are suitable for FM radio, not suitable for movie making.think about it. thanks.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
460,nastjageohelli,sad,6,27 July 2017,"Mostly i just feel really bad for the cast; now everybody's gonna mark this one as a bad movie, when really it could've been a great movie with the exact same cast if only someone actually read the book before writing the script. So many things i loved about this book, of which very little got to the movie part.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
461,elinasandberg,Disappointed,3,24 July 2018,"After watching the first movie I was thrilled to watch the second one. I've never been more disappointed in my life, not even when I watched ""from dusk till dawn"" for the first time. I was expecting to get answers in this movie but all I got was more questions. I wanted to know why they put people in the maze in the first place and why Teresa and Thomas worked for wickd but suddenly were put in the maze etc etc.This movie is just more than 2 hours wasted on more questions than before. Half of the lines are: ""come on, let's go!"" ""What is going on?"" And ""You'll see"" and the worst part is that you don't even get to see or even understand what the h*ll is going on. I recommend watching the first movie but you could easily skip the second one and live on with your life.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
462,dswensen-74414,"Good movie, major changes.",8,28 September 2017,"It's a good movie all by itself, but if you're expecting it to be a whole lot like the book, be prepared for disappointment. At least I was a little disappointed. At the same time, though, I think they had to make some major differences to prevent an R-rating, due to the more gory and graphic details in the book. Overall, great story-line, loved the acting and special effects. If you're looking for a movie that stays mostly true to the book, I wouldn't recommend this one. If you're just looking for a good dystopian thriller, this one's perfect!",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
463,chasityrtaylor,Just another disaster,1,24 October 2017,"The one thing that this movie has in common with the book, is the title and that's even a stretch. The book was original, intriguing, action packed. The movie was just like hey lets just shoot at things, like that will help get the deposit back for the studio. All in all, the movie would be seen as ""decent"" as i have been told by people that have not read the books. But to those of us that have read the books, we would like to know what the director was on when he was making this movie. Was it acid, cocaine, or was it just plain ignorance? The director was have been blind if he thought this movie was going to get any kind of award for best motion picture.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
464,meganmccaffrey-95112,awful,1,5 May 2019,"They changed the whole entire storyline. I got so confused that i thought i watched the wrong movie that is how different the book and movie are. For example Teresa and thomas don't even have telepathy in the movie, and much more plus teresa wasn't in the desert with them in the book. They did an awful job someone should remake this movie, but actually follow the storyline",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
465,scaptor-15716,Not like the book AT ALL,3,16 May 2018,"If you're gonna watch this movie, don't read the book. OR read the book, and don't watch the movie. Just don't do both or you'll be very disappointed. I've read all the books, and I was looking forward to the second movie after watching the first, but it just disappointed me so much. The book was way better, to be honest, so I suggest the book WAY more than the movie.",Maze Runner - The Scorch Trials
