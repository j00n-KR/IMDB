0,Leofwine_draca,Mawkish,1,14 September 2021,One of the films that soured me to Julia Roberts. Completely mawkish and utterly sentimental in tone. I've gone through bereavement and illness in real life and it was nothing like this Hollywood lite version of real life.,Stepmom
1,SnoopyStyle,Weird chemistry,4,16 December 2013,"Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) are divorced with 2 kids Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken). He's been seeing Isabel (Julia Roberts) a top fashion photographer. Jackie and Isabel clash over mothering styles. It all comes crashing down when Jackie is diagnose with cancer.These characters seems too fake to me. I think it may be Julia Roberts' fault. I can't really picture her as this character. Maybe it's her star power, or maybe it's that she doesn't play the young trophy girlfriend that often. And I never could imagine Sarandon and Harris as parents to two little kids. There is something wrong with the family makeup that I can't quite put a finger on.Director Chris Columbus doesn't do a good job at making this a more compelling movie. It starts too light heartedly with too many joke attempts. I think it's a mistake to try for the comedic route. It's even worst since the attempts fail. Then comes the constant fighting, bickering, and incessant back biting which really put me off. Then comes the cancer.This is a miss for me. I just don't really feel it. Maybe people of divorces relate to this movie more. I think there's a great possible movie idea to dive deeply into the mother character. This one is trying too hard to see it through Isabel's eyes.",Stepmom
2,mark.waltz,two giants of cinema make this an appealing 'chick flick' for all to enjoy,7,7 August 2013,"Grab a box of Kleenex, a bag of popcorn and a sweetheart to share the tears with in this coming together of two women who would otherwise despise each other. They are the ex-wife and girlfriend of a busy dad who must learn to co-exist when potential tragedy arises. Oscar winners Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts both shine in this more recent variation of ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Beaches"" where women end competition for the greater good. Sarandon is a force of nature as she goes from resentful of her ex's fiancée to confiding when a potentially fatal disease strikes, making it necessary to prepare her two children for the possibility that they will have to go on with future step-mom Roberts. The kids have understandably conflicting feelings and even when the teen daughter gets bratty, you empathize with her. Watching these two remarkable suddenly become pals is touching and rewarding, and scenes of New York in the fall and winter are beautiful. Roberts underplays her part, instilling her character with understanding and integrity, even humor. In an era where women seem intent on allowing themselves to be presented in a less nurturing light and allow the media to focus on mainly negative aspects, it is films like this which truly remind us of the qualities that make women great and give us the chance to celebrate their true strengths which do not have to result in a cat fight on a TV reality show.",Stepmom
3,kosmasp,Two moms,8,12 March 2021,"Having those two women be your ""mom"" may sound like a dream come true. One your former mom (aka ex wife of your father) and one your current. But this is not a dream come true as much as it is a nightmare come to life. Especially because both are not really into each other - and you can see and understand why to at least a certain degree.Great performances all around. And while I think you very likely know where this is heading (no points for guessing the ending then), it is the journey that is really the one to experience without overthinking things. Relax, sit back and just enjoy the drama",Stepmom
4,lee_eisenberg,"from what I saw of Sarandon's and Roberts's careers in the '90s, I would've never expected this",10,9 November 2020,"Throughout the 1990s, I saw Susan Sarandon as the paradigm of a serious actress, as she appeared in the likes of ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Dead Man Walking"", while I saw Julia Roberts as the paradigm of a joke, since she starred mainly in romcoms. I heard about ""Stepmom"" when it got released but have only now gotten around to seeing it. Impressive one, looking at a divorced family's attempt to accept a new woman as the matriarch. There are some intense scenes due to hostility between the original mom and new one, as well as the daughter's reluctance to accept the new one.All in all, it's not a masterpiece but a fine piece of work nonetheless. The Thanksgiving pageant where the children sing ""This Land Is Your Land"" brings to mind that Woody Guthrie was one of Fred Trump's tenants, and he even wrote a song about what a crummy landlord the elder Trump was (and of course, the children in the pageant don't get to sing the ""This Land Is Your Land"" verse denouncing private property).Director Chris Columbus had previously done the first two Home Alone movies as well as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and later did the first two Harry Potter movies.",Stepmom
5,jboothmillard,Stepmom,7,12 April 2008,"From director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) this is a pretty good family film. Basically Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' Liam Aiken) Harrison have had to cope with the divorce of their parents Jackie (Golden Globe nominated Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris), and also the new woman in Luke's life, successful photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts). She does her best to treat the kids in a good way, as the ""Stepmom"" she is, but the job she loves gets in the way, and she doesn't want to drop it. Also, Isbael and Jackie do not get on too well because Jackie regards Isabel's efforts to look after the kids not good enough. The conflict between them is deepened when Jackie is suddenly diagnosed with cancer, which devastates Isabel when she finds out, and the same will go for the kids when she knows her chemotherapy has failed to work. Towards the end, it gets quite emotional as the kids express their feelings for their dying mother, and seem to get on a bit better with Isabel, and they have a final Christmas and photo. Also starring Lynn Whitfield as Dr. P. Sweikert, Darrell Larson as Duncan Samuels and Mary Louise Wilson as Mrs. Franklin. The performances are all good, the family story is always good, not too much sentimentality to make it cutesy, and one or two quite emotional moments. Julia Roberts was number 29, and Susan Sarandon number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Stepmom
6,moonspinner55,Manipulative star-vehicle which the talented stars cannot save...,4,2 February 2007,"After Ed Harris and Susan Sarandon separate, he proposes to new girlfriend Julia Roberts, with Ed and Susan's confused kids forced into taking sides. Manipulative, ""heartwarming"" movie filled with adorable characters all hiding their collective wonderfulness under scowling masks of sarcasm. It represents the nadir of the notorious 'Ali MacGraw disease' (in this case, cancer) wherein someone gets to expire slowly, and lovingly, all the while glowing with strength, warmth and acceptance. Sarandon dances around the house with her children (""Sweatin' To The Oldies"" without Richard Simmons?), Roberts orchestrates Sarandon's daughter's put-down of a middle school Lothario, and poor Harris disappears ""at the office"" whenever the script warrants a verbal cat fight between the two ladies. It's directed at the ""Terms Of Endearment"" crowd, but with dialogue such as, ""Don't walk out on your mother!""...""No Dad, that's your job!"", I would suspect smart viewers would take an early walk. *1/2 from ****",Stepmom
7,sunwarrior13,Stepmom Falls Short From Reaching Its Potential,8,6 October 2012,"Director Chris Columbus continues to explore the family turmoil of divorce in the tearjerker Stepmom, a story that pits the birth mother against the new mother.This comedy drama stars Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, and Ed Harris together with Jena Malone and Liam Aiken.Jackie, a one-time book editor, is now the consummate soccer mom juggling the schedules of her two kids in her New York ranch outside of Manhattan. Her ex-husband Luke, who gets weekend custody of the kids, is living in the city with a woman half his age named Isabel, a high- fashion photographer with a strong sense of style. Since Luke is always away at work, the burden of getting the kids ready for school when they are with their father falls on Isabel, and she just isn't the nurturing type. The story heats up, however, when Jackie learns that she has cancer. Facing the horrors of medical tests and chemotherapy, she realizes that, should something happen to her, her kids will be left with this irresponsible Isabel as their mother, especially after Luke proposes marriage to her. What ensues is part parenting lesson, part competitive parenting, but 100 percent family bonding, as Jackie must learn to allow Isabel to be part of her world and her family.The movie manages to touch on that chord because it shows how an ambitious woman might feel hampered by the responsibility of children just because she's fallen in love with their dad.It's an issue that haunts millions of second wives everywhere, and Julia Roberts portrays that role extremely well. Susan Sarandon's performance as a mom about to be replaced by her ex-husband's new girlfriend has a lot of bite, and it's a shame the script opted to marginalize and trivialize her plight in its final reel.The film tries to avoid complexities in the screenplay and it wimps out in the end, solving the problem by giving Sarandon a terminal illness. Instead of allowing Jackie and Isabel's relationship to unfold on something less than a high note, the movie has to quell its best thing with a false payoff because it doesn't know what to do with real life. That is the reason why this film falls short its potential to have been a great film.",Stepmom
8,evanston_dad,Sarandon and Roberts Valiantly Try to Make This More Than a Gag Fest,5,22 June 2010,"1998 gave audiences two major moms dying pictures, one of them ""One True Thing"" with Meryl Streep and Renee Zellweger and the other ""Stepmom."" Chris Columbus directed this. There, that's all you need to know. Filmed like a T.V. sitcom but with the content of a Hallmark movie, it's paint by numbers film-making that works overtime trying to wrench tears from its audience. That it does is only because it's about a subject that would make anyone with a half-way functioning heart cry, not because of any skill on Columbus's part.Julia Roberts and especially Susan Sarandon do a fair job of keeping the overly-abundant sentimentality at bay, but they have to fight Columbus every step of the way.Grade: C+",Stepmom
9,anaconda-40658,Step On This Film.,1,19 March 2016,"Stepmom (1998): Dir: Chris Columbus / Cast: Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon, Ed Harris, Jena Malone, Liam Aiken: Nauseating spectacle advertised as a cheerful comedy but fits more as a dramatic punch to the genitals. Julia Roberts plays the stepmom who represents growth and the acceptance of further responsibility. Many unnecessary problems enter the lives of the children. The daughter's problems at school are not relevant and poorly handled, and the son's trip to the hospital only serves as an excuse for the two leads to bicker. Roberts is a fashion photographer who wishes to communicate with the children. Sarandon suffers from cancer and uses a former job to cover it up. The result is a boring farce with two highly paid actresses rehearsing Family Feud. Directed half-heartedly by Chris Columbus who seems to lose touch with the subject matter. He dealt with this theme in similar fashion in Mrs. Doubtfire,which is much funnier, while this film is about as depressing as being on a ledge and readying to jump. Roberts and Sarandon bicker until arriving at a contrived revelation. Ed Harris as the ex-husband only surfaces for plot convenience. As for the children, they sniffle and whine until those closing credits indicating the film is over gives viewers reason to cheer. As oppose to a theme of amendments, it presents a celebrity argument. Score: 1 / 10",Stepmom
10,gradyharp,'If you want me to hate her I will.',8,3 May 2013,"It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show. But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family. It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp",Stepmom
11,namashi_1,Two Thumbs Up!,8,9 December 2009,"Chris Columbus directed 'Stepmom' is a winner all the way... a true 1998 Classic! The film is highly entertaining, in fact there is hardly a moment when you feel bored in this 123 minute-film. Columbus has made superb films, and 'Stepmom' ranks as his best.The film has a beautiful story, a story about a divorced couple, their children and the Stepmom. The film explains the worth of a family... it surely leaves a great moral behind. The climax is superb, it gets you moist-eyed.Performance-wise: Ed Harris is Incredible, as ever. He steals the show in a small, but significant role. Julia Roberts is fantastic as the Stepmom. Susan Sarandon needs to mentioning, she's a class apart. Liam Aiken & Jena Malone, the kids, stand out.On the whole 'Stepmom' is a must watch for each and every cine-lover.",Stepmom
12,JamesHitchcock,What Would Scriptwriters Do Without Terminal Illness?,5,2 February 2005,"Stepmom gets off to quite a promising start. Luke Harrison, a successful lawyer, is divorced, and the film depicts the bitterness between his former wife, Jackie, and his new girlfriend, Isabel, with Luke himself caught between the two women. (Rather surprisingly, the part of Luke is a relatively minor one; the film concentrates much more on the two women's relationship with each other). The two have quite different personalities. Jackie is a full-time mother and housewife(she has two young children by Luke), whereas Isabel (much the younger of the two)has a successful career as a photographer for an advertising agency. Jackie is rather conservative, Isabel more trendy. (Jackie, for example, likes classical music, while Isabel is a rock fan).What raises the film, in its opening scenes, above the ordinary, is the subtle way in which the two women are portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts. Perhaps unusually for a film of this type, the thrusting career woman Isabel is the more sympathetic of the two. For all Jackie's ""Earth Mother"" pretensions, she comes across as a bitter and rather unpleasant character. Although Isabel was not the ""other woman"" in Luke and Jackie's divorce, Jackie nevertheless resents her presence in Luke's life, and uses her children as a weapon in her battle. The children, particularly the girl Anna, do not get on with Isabel, and Jackie never misses an opportunity to encourage them in their dislike.The film's turning-point comes when Luke proposes to Isabel and, at about the same time, Jackie is diagnosed with cancer. Jackie realises that Isabel will be playing a permanent role in her children's life and, as her own disease might prove fatal, that in future Isabel may possibly be the only mother the children will have. The rest of the film tells the story of how the two women come to terms with, and learn to respect, one another.Unfortunately, the film starts to decline from this turning-point onward. The pace becomes fatally slow, and a potentially interesting story of the tensions arising upon the break-up of a family unit descends into soap opera. I sometimes wonder what scriptwriters would do without terminal illness to rely on as a plot device. It is, however, a difficult device to use successfully; most films that rely upon it fall into the trap of maudlin sentimentality. Stepmom is perhaps better than some, but this is largely due to the skill of the three main leads, Roberts, Sarandon and Ed Harris as Luke. There is little in the script that would distinguish the film from the average ""disease of the month"" TV movie, except that a TV movie would perhaps move at a faster pace and would not draw out the agony to such an extent. 5/10",Stepmom
13,theowinthrop,"Worthy expansion and remake of ""No Sad Songs For Me""",8,25 February 2009,"Sometimes a great star is able to make a final screen appearance that his or her fans realize is fitting their stature. Spencer Tracy did it with his final screen speech to Katherine Hepburn and the cast of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER about the lingering passions in his elderly frame towards the woman he actually did love. Paul Muni did it too in his last film, THE LAST ANGRY MAN, giving a performance as a true humanitarian doctor in his final days. Laird Cregar did it in those concluding, unforgettable shots of his mad musician in ""Hell"" in the burning conclusion of HANGOVER SQUARE. And Margaret O'Sullivan did it as the terminally ill mother and wife determined to have her family secured by a worthy second wife (Vivica Lindfors) in NO SAD SONGS FOR ME.O'Sullivan left a small output of films compared to her fellow female stars of the 1930s - 1940s, but they were mostly good performances in such films as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, THE GOOD FAIRY, THREE COMRADES. and THE MORTAL STORM. She never won the Oscar, but she is recognized as one of the finest actresses of her age. The ultimate tragedy of her life - the emotional troubles that led to her suicide in 1960 - reinforce the sense of loss in her curtailed movie career as much as the death of James Dean does for him or the cancer that killed Judy Holliday a few years after O'Sullivan died.The film NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was remade in 1998 with a first rate cast and expanded. STEPMOM demonstrates how a remake can help redefine the characters of the original film and even make them more interesting. In NO SAD SONGS FOR ME, O'Sullivan moves silently for most of the film to manipulate husband Wendell Corey into seeing Lindfors as a worthy replacement for herself. But this is a little hard to believe (though the acting of O'Sullivan makes it acceptable). Instead the remake forces Susan Sarandon (in the O'Sullivan part) to make 180 degree reversal for the sake of her ex-husband and kids. Instead of a placid household disrupted by on-coming tragedy, Sarandon's household is disrupted initially by her husband (Ed Harris) two-timing her with his new love Julia Roberts. Harris wants a divorce, and being a successful professional man he can give Sarandon a lot of money. But Sarandon is furious at the slap in her face and in the opening of the film she confronts both Harris and Roberts about their adultery. Her anger also spills over into resentment by her children (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken) who fully side with Mom. It is after the divorce that she learns the truth about her health problems. But there are methods of handling the cancer in 1998 unavailable to Margaret O'Sullivan in 1950. Methods like chemotherapy. Sarandon (who is determined to beat back her illness) tries these methods, and leaves the scene to explore these treatments. Meanwhile Roberts finds she is trying to maintain her photography career and to somehow overcome the resentment of the two step-children.Now all this additional material enables the main thrust of the original story to make a trifle more sense. For after Sarandon finds all the treatments to be unworkable she returns to see what can be salvaged in her limited remaining time. This means making an alliance with the suspicious Roberts...one that eventually does soften into a close friendship as they both find each other's finer qualities. Not that Sarandon is really happy at what is going to happen to her. In one of the film's best scenes she vents to Roberts her total anger that she will not be alive to see her daughter get married. The venting actually helps break down the final walls between the two women.Slowly, as Harris, Malone, and Aiken become aware of the impending tragedy, the family unit expands to make room again for Sarandon as she makes sure she and her children spend as much time together as possible. And Roberts makes sure that Sarandon's intentions for the two children are carried out (which enables her to finally win their trust and affections). The best moment in this section of the film is Roberts making sure that Malone is avenged against an obnoxious ex-boyfriend at her high school, where (with Sarandon's approval) Roberts uses a male model she knows and some special dialog (regarding a disgusting sex act) to humiliate the boy before his friends.NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was a great conclusion to a fine actress's screen career. STEPMOM was a first rate remake and expansion of that film enabling two of our finest current leading actresses to share the screen in two equally memorable parts.",Stepmom
14,atlasmb,Sarandon and Roberts Shine!,8,30 July 2013,"Stepmom is a wonderful, life-affirming film that benefits from the great direction of Chris Columbus, the beautiful music of John Williams, and a great screenplay.Ed Harris is great as the father, though his role is smaller. The two children are spot on. But what really drives this film are the portrayals of the mother by Susan Sarandon and the stepmother by Julia Roberts.This film is about universal truths: Life has its ups and downs. Love has its ups and downs. Some of the strongest familial bonds are forged from needing. And when you really love someone, there is no wrong way to do it.The story traces the progress between the mom and the stepmom--two women who have to face their fears of a new family dynamic. The mother was there for all the tender moments, all the wounds and all the memories. The stepmom is the ""cool"" one who knows the lyrics to all the songs and is current with today's fashions. To become a whole family, the mother must overcome her fear of being replaced and the stepmother must overcome her fear of comparison with an irreplaceable mother.This is a tearjerker. The resolution goes far beyond the daily struggles of a family rent by divorce. Well worth seeing.",Stepmom
15,filipemanuelneto,"A movie that works best on TV, but it has been forgotten over time.",4,3 November 2019,"This one-hundred-percent family movie is about divorce and how families rebuild later. Essentially, it's a movie about losses, and how they are surmountable. Directed by Chris Columbus and dedicated by him to his late mother, who had died of cancer the previous year, the film also deals with cancer and death. To some extent, it may even have been a way for the director to deal with grief.The script is simple: After divorcing Jackie, Luke decides to date photographer Isabel. But she is not welcomed by his ex-wife, who declares war on her, nor by the two children they have had, and who definitely don't want her around, seeing her as their mother's illegitimate substitute in their father's life. Isabel, a woman who never wanted to be a mother, tries to deal with children in the best way but makes mistakes and is heavily reprimanded. But everything changes when Jackie is diagnosed with cancer. The disease forces everyone to review how they relate and ultimately drives Jackie closer to Isabel.At cast level, the two lead actresses take the film back on their own: Julia Roberts is a good actress and is in good shape here, and Susan Sarandon also does a good job, although her character is obnoxious and cynical most of the time. The end makes us feel that she has received back the bad karma she has planted. Ed Harris does what he needs to do, but his character only exists because he really had to exist, and hardly appears in most of the movie. It's a female movie. Children, of course, have a good participation as well, but they just do childish things, with the exception of Jena Malone, who is old enough to give us something else - and she can do it.Personally, I found this movie decent enough for the TV as it reminds me of movies that are made from scratch for the small screen. There is no cinematic sense in the way everything was conceived. I've never seen him in the movie theater but I think it would go a long way ... it's a wrong-thinking movie with great actors that seem to me to be underused most of the time. Perhaps that is why it has been forgotten and, more than twenty years after its release, almost no one remembers it.",Stepmom
16,lisafordeay,A sentimental drama that will tug at your heartstrings,7,26 February 2015,"Julia Roberts from Mirror Mirror and Susan Sarandon from Enchanted team up in this touching drama about a woman named Jackie(Sarandon)who's husband(played by Ed Harris) divorces her and is now engaged to a much younger woman named Isabelle(played by Roberts)and has two children from her ex. Of course when Jackie first meets Isabelle she detests her and would do anything to get her kids back even if it was signing a contract to keep her kids. But Jackie of course is hiding a painful secret(yup what I am going to say is like what Nicholas Sparks would do in his novels been turned into movies), she has terminal cancer. Of course she doesn't tell her kids nor her ex husband about it and would go to a private clinic to get herself looked after. But how long has she left to live? And will she get treatment?From the man that brought you Mrs Doubtfire and Home Alone as well as the first Harry Potter film,this is a real tearjearker to watch,especially near the end where I was left teary-eyed in the end. The cast was spot on. Susan Sarandon was excellent as the bitchy ex wife to Ed Harris who is dying of cancer. While Julia Roberts(sporting a much lighter hair-do than her frizzy curly red hair)was great as Isabelle the photographer that steal Ed's heart.The story to its credit has been done to death and like I have mentioned this movie might as well been made into a novel by Nicholas Sparks as it carries the same cliché as his novels(even though he never wrote a novel on this movie).Bottom line if you haven't seen it and if its on TV I recommend it to you or if you want you can just buy it on DVD.B-7/10",Stepmom

If I'm honest think I liked it more the first time around than in my re-watch. Its still a pretty good movie that you can't help getting pulled into, a bit soap opera-ie, lots of angst, moments of humour all held together by a great cast.Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon give amazing performances here (even if Julia's lips are distracting at times) The kids also do a great job capturing cute, bratty and sad realistically. The little boy is very cute. Ed Harris even pops in and out as the father/boyfriend (which is always nice) but this story is about the relationship between the woman.So yeah this is a heart-tugger with Roberts playing a career minded photographer whose relationship with a lawyer (Harris) gets complex as she clashes with his supermom ex-wife (Sarandon) over the well being of the children.

I didn't laugh out loud, though. I laughed on the inside. The one person I really couldn't stand at times was Anna (Jena Malone). This was because of her attitude and the way she treated Isabel (Julia Roberts) most of the time. My favorite quotes of this movie are, ""Anna! You do not run out on your mother,"" and, ""I never said I was June f*****' Cleaver!"" I was thoroughly moved when Jackie (Susan Sarandon) said, ""Oh, sweetie, it's okay to miss me."" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, that I thought everyone involved in this movie did a superb job.

19,davispittman,Touching story,8,12 November 2017,"Stepmom is a film that focuses on a mothers relationship with the new stepmother, especially when the mother falls ill to a terminal disease. The acting is superbly done. A listers Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon play the stepmother and mother, and they do a really great job. I loved the chemistry and connection between Sarandon and Roberts, it's pretty rocky at first, as most of those kind of relationships can be, but as time goes on and partly for the kids sake, that relationship gets better and that's a really sweet thing to see. The movies writing stands out the most when it is a scene between just the two main female characters, it is pretty emotional because of the circumstances that come about later in the movie, but I thought the screen writers handled it very well. The child actors were alright, although to be quite honest I didn't really like the daughter and how she played her character, for some reason I just really didn't like how she was. The film is definitely a tearjerker and it'll satisfy anyone who is looking for a well made drama film, but I do warm that if you don't like sad movies, then you will not like this one. 8/10 for Stepmom.",Stepmom

22,eric262003,Forceful Tear-Jerker of a Movie,5,19 April 2015,"""Stepmom"" tells the dramatic and forceful tear-laden film in which a New York City advertising photographer named Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts) has recently been engaged to the much older and recently divorced attorney name Luke Harrison (Ed Harris). Although he is divorced from his ex-wife, Jackie(Susan Sarandon), she still has legal rights to visit her kids, the rebellious Anna (Jena Malone) and the bratty younger son Ben (Liam Aiken). At first glance, we take our sympathies towards Isabel who's trying so hard to win the approval with the rather difficult and exasperating kids and that Jackie seems quite judgemental over Luke's choice of a new fiancé because she's not from the same class system as her. But as the film progresses, we find ourselves taking pity over Jackie who in spite of her obnoxious character and her overbearing poisonous tongue, we discover that she has terminal cancer. Meanwhile the kids seem to adapt to similar behaviour patterns, and Luke just goes on what needs to be done without saying very much. In spite of the ensemble of talented performers, ""Stepmom"" was cursed by a mundane script and forceful attempt to get the entire audience in tears. The box office success was quite mediocre at best as Susan Sarandon was nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance. I was quite surprised that the Academy Awards neglected this film, since their mindsets are based on films that provide emotional backdrops from the characters. To me in my estimation the demographics of people who'll look up to this movie are likely upper middle-class women in the 30-40 year old age group. Perhaps the Anna Harrison character might attract the adolescent girl demographics especially those who have a divorced or deceased parent and are struggling with adapting to their new parent. The middle-aged parents who are sadly diagnosed with a terminal illness might also find the story intriguing and might have a better understanding of the physical and emotional stages they're going through let alone the hardships of those surrounding them. I might sound like an insensitive jerk, but I really did not feel at ease watching this movie. The acting and the cinematography were the best things going for this movie,but there was a lump in my throat after the final credits rolled. I really thought director Chris Columbus did too much manipulative tactics to force us into one tear-fest after another. The representing of the tear-factor shed very little impact plus there were many scenes that made me feel very uncomfortable. If you thought ""Stepmom"" was a feel-good movie, what were you thinking? When Isabel learns that Anna's had a nasty break-up with her discourteous boyfriend Brad Kovitsky (Jason Maves), she encourages Anna to inflict verbal abuse towards him by calling him names like limp-dick, while Ben is can be seen giggling at every word that's said. Gee, I thought adults discouraged kids to call others names, not encourage them. Sure Brad may have deserved that, but adults should know better that it's not appropriate behaviour. I was also taken aback by the rich, posh multi-million dollar estate that Jackie was residing in and clichéd of course was the fact that it came with a horse and a horse trail.It made me ponder at just how did a nice charming New York City fashion photographer like Isabel Kelly would ever get romantically involved with a much older, mundane guy like Luke and having to put up with two quite incorrigible children who clearly hate her for the sake of her existence. I also couldn't believe my eyes during the scenes at the school play where all the kids were dressed in perfect Hollywood style costumes and each and every one of their voices sound purely angelic. Didn't they have at least one kid who felt awkward or uncomfortable? That would have been believable. What's also strange was that Anna was six years older than Ben. How the hell are they in the same play? Shouldn't they be in different schools? Okay so maybe the scriptwriter may know the classic song of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, but it makes me wonder how did Anna and Ben seem to know this song quite flawlessly? They were born in 1986 and 1991 respectively several years before this song was ever released. The other thing that bugs me was that the connection they had with this song serves as the unity between them. It also sickens me that they play this song on three occasions. Gaye and Terrell had other songs that weren't about going through get lengths to unite with one another.One a plus note I'm really impressed with the resiliency towards Isabel. I mean surviving through all the ordeals between this very hateful family, deserves a standing ovation. She standing up to the materialistic Jackie and her obnoxious step-daughter without the desires to strangle either one deserves my praises.Overall this is not a horrible film, though I can't really recommend it due to the hateful characters, the uncomfortable atmosphere and the details that make me cringe. We should feel sorry about someone dying, but we can't embody pity because of the venom that comes out of the victim's mouth. I would steer clear from this one.",Stepmom
23,valadas,Brilliant performance,8,5 May 2021,"This is a very good movie not only for truthfulness of the story, the attractive images, the realistic dialogues and the firm direction but above all for the brilliant performances of all the performers, including the two children that do a very convincing work, psichologically and sentimentaly (although it may be a little shocking to see a child actress refer sex in a conversation though very shortly). The story is simple to tell though having some very complicated situations. Luke and Jackie had been husband and wife but divorced and Luke has a girlfriend, Isabel with whom he lives. He and Jackie have two very bright children, a boy and a girl. The relationship between the children and her mother with Luke and Isabel is somewhat tense mainly because the children do not feel well with their stepmom Isabel though she tries to conquer their love. But since they all are intelligent and wise people the story develops itself in terms of a progressive relationship improvement despite Jackie having a fatal cancer that will not let her much time to live. The movie has a happy ending with the taking of a beautiful photo of the five sitting friendly side by side In Christmas Eve,",Stepmom
24,Beta_Gallinger,"Emotional, like it's supposed to be, but that doesn't hide the flaws",5,5 May 2008,"During my first year and second semester of high school, I was forced to watch this movie in a class which involved various things, including lessons in family life and peers, so this movie fit. From what I remember, it certainly wasn't fun when I first watched it, but I didn't see it in what I thought to be a comfortable place. However, it's been six years since then, and I recently rented it to watch on my own free will. I think it was more pleasant watching it alone in my basement, and I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part, but I could still see some serious flaws.Jackie and Luke Harrison are a divorced couple who had two kids while they were together named Anna and Ben. Now that they are divorced, Luke is currently dating a significantly younger woman named Isabel Kelly, who is a professional photographer. When it comes to parenting, Isabel is highly inexperienced, so it's not easy for her to look after the kids when she is left to do so, and her job sometimes gets in the way. In addition to that, the kids don't like their step-mom, and Jackie is sometimes disgusted by Isabel's inability to look after the kids properly, despite how much she may try, so the two women don't tend to get along so well. However, when Jackie is diagnosed with cancer, which could mean she won't live much longer, she must try to work things out with Isabel and family.Playing the song, ""Under Pressure"", by Queen, while Isabel wakes up and has to rush the kids out of bed was a good way to start off the film. After that, I found quite a bit of tension in the film to keep me intrigued, but that didn't stop me from noticing some pretty lame moments. This includes some of the dialogue, and a poor attempt at comedy I can think of when Ben burps and Anna says, ""Oh, I hate when you do that, I can smell your breakfast!"" Isabel's advice for Anna on how to get back at her nasty ex-boyfriend is also rather poorly thought out. One of the things she suggests she says to him is, ""I'm not going to waste my time on some loser who doesn't even know what snowblowing is."" Now, it would have been worse if Isabel had actually told Anna what snowblowing is, and since this is not an R-rated film, it's obviously never mentioned what it means, but this part is still pretty stupid. Having a 12 year old character talk about snowblowing may have worked in a really raunchy comedy, but not in a drama! Lastly, there's not much to like about the characters, including Anna with her bitterness and insults, and Jackie, who does something pretty cruel to Isabel with that Pearl Jam concert!Now, like I said, I certainly can't say I was bored for the most part when I last watched this movie. I may have even gotten a lump in my throat towards the end, but due to certain problems with some of the characters and the writing, I feel I may have been cheated by the film. I didn't exactly feel it was all really worth it, even if some parts are done well. 5/10 just MIGHT be a BIT too low, but not by much. Some parts confused me, and sometimes even put a puzzled look on my face. It may have had a lot of potential that wasn't reached. I'm sure this movie has made many people cry, which I noticed in that high school class, and I don't hold anything against these people. I'm sure it would have made me cry if I were more emotional. However, that still doesn't change my opinion that ""Stepmom"" is a lacklustre drama which could move you, but could also possibly leave you wondering what for.",Stepmom
25,Mister-6,"Pretty good, but....",7,12 September 1999,"Yes, I said BUT.  I'll get to but WHAT later.""Stepmom"" is indeed a tear-jerker, and many tears are jerked during the course of the movie.  It is, after all, about a dying mother (Sarandon) making sure the torch is passed on for her ex-husband's (Harris) new wife (Roberts) to take care of her two children.That much we understand, and there are several scenes of adjustment between all parties, many serious questions dealt with (though most of the answers are about as deep as a Hallmark card) and tears shed on-screen about every 5 - 6 minutes or so.  Not that this is a criticism; even though Columbus directed this as well as ""Nine Months"" and the first two ""Home Alone"" movies, I didn't go in expecting Robin Williams or Joe Pesci to pop up unannounced, bashing each other in the head.  Maybe a little more gallows humor, perhaps?  But that's just nit-picking: the tears are shed honestly here.  My God, who wouldn't be bawling in this situation?Now, here comes the BUT.SPOILER...But here is what gets me.  THE MOVIE ENDS BEFORE SARANDON DIES.  No fancy funeral, no chance to see if or how Roberts adjusts on her own with the kids and Harris, and no angelic spirit of the departed Sarandon looking down and watching with an approving smile at her family as Roberts tends to them. Not that I'm being morbid but as the man said, if someone coughs in the first reel you expect to see them laid out for observation in the last. ...END OF SPOILERAs it is, it may be a ""chick flick"", but a very well-done ""chick flick"". Who better than Sarandon and Roberts as the respective wife and ""Stepmom"" of the title?  If you're a fan of either, go check it out.  You'll laugh a little, cry a lot.Seven stars.

29,Tito-8,"A great film, despite many problems",8,24 April 2000,"This was a very enjoyable movie, which is no small feat considering there are two major flaws.  The biggest problem is how formulaic this film is from start to finish.  I'm sure that most viewers knew how the film would end (and how it would get there) about ten minutes into the picture.  The other big problem is Susan Sarandon's character, a person who was easy to hate. However, even with these big mistakes and some other small ones, this is still a great movie.  Julia Roberts was hugely appealing, Ed Harris and Sarandon were solid as always, and even the kids were quite effective. Plus, there were several humorous moments, and the sadder scenes were equally effective.

30,MattyGibbs,"Excellent, well acted weepie",8,2 August 2014,"Stepmom is a well acted drama if slightly melodramatic film. I'm not quite sure why it's billed on here as a comedy/drama, although it does have some lighter moments it's a serious film and definitely not comedic. Knowing you are dying and are going to leave your children with another woman must be terrifying prospect for any woman. Stepmom does a good job of giving a balanced view both women's situation. Susan Sarandon is fantastic as the bitter ex wife who finds out she is dying. Julia Roberts also does a good support job as the prospective step mom. Jena Malone gives a great performance as the young girl struggling to come to terms with the situation. The film builds nicely towards it's inevitably sad conclusion. This is certainly up there with the saddest films I've ever seen. Be ready with the tissues if you are prone to crying at sad films. Stepmom is definitely a film aimed more towards the female market (it's one of my wife's favourites) but I'm not ashamed to say I really like it. Recommended.",Stepmom

Anna really is terrible in her tantrums and snubbings and nastiness directed at her stepmom Isabelle (Roberts). But you can see why she would be like that. Almost as nasty is Sarandon's character, who belittles and berates Isabelle. It's a tiny bit disturbing that the Dad essentially side-steps all the drama and doesn't have to deal with it. Particularly since he broke up the family. It's a bit sexist that the women are catty and bitchy. Sometimes the movie is a bit preachy and predictable. But it does try to portray the journey that people in these situations can go through before some sort of harmony is restored.",Stepmom
34,roghache,Step parenting tearjerker with some bad messages,5,7 May 2006,"Yes, I admit that I enjoyed this bittersweet tearjerker of a movie. Get out the Kleenex for the ending. There is nothing sadder than a mother saying goodbye to her children. However, on reflection, I have a few problems with its messages.First the story...Jackie and Luke have separated, and Luke has a new woman in his life, a beautiful young photographer named Isabel. Their two children, a young boy and a teenage girl, are forced to adjust to this situation and understandably cause their new step mom, Isabel, a lot of grief. Also understandably, Jackie becomes petty and spiteful when her children begin spending time with this new woman. To add to all this, Jackie is suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer and sadly, must 'hand over' her beloved children to another woman, the step mom, to raise as she realizes she will not survive to complete this task herself. Eventually, Jackie and Isabel form a touching bond as they learn to trust each other.Really, it is a moving tale with wonderful performances by both the female leads. Susan Sarandon is compelling, first as the devoted but possessive mother, then the bravely suffering and dying cancer victim, Jackie. Some have called her a 'nasty earth mother', but this threatening new step mom wouldn't bring out the best in anyone (albeit Jackie agreed to this separation, making her husband fair game). Quite possibly she was actually nice before this rival appeared. Julia Roberts, always endearing in every role, elicits unlimited viewer sympathy as the well intended 'wicked step mom' who constantly tries her best but cannot seem to do anything right. It paints a vivid portrait of a common challenge faced by step parents.The husband, Luke, portrayed by Ed Harris, has admittedly (as another also noted) zero chemistry with Isabel and is almost a minor character. It's all about the women. Anna, the 12 year old daughter, is spoiled, typically self absorbed, and in dire need of discipline. She is nasty as all get out to poor Isabel. But no wonder, what girl needs her family life upset at that critical age? Who can blame her, especially with her mom encouraging both her children to cause trouble for their dad's new love interest? In fact, these two children shouldn't have to cope with step people in the first place. They deserve ONE stable home with their two biological parents, Jackie and Luke, not shuffled to and fro in order to meet the self absorbed needs of the very adults who should be putting their children's interests first. These parents realize that their separation has upset the kids' lives, so they basically let Anna get away with murder. Frankly, sympathetic as Julia Roberts' portrayal is, this is a situation Isabel brought upon herself in her choice of a partner who has recently separated and has children.Of course Jackie is the older, strict, conservative mother, while Isabel is the young, trendy, fun one. Isabel's stunt in hiring a handsome 'boyfriend' for Anna may seem cool, make herself popular, and win over the difficult step daughter, but it isn't the right values to teach. No wonder Jackie becomes angry. Isabel would make a fabulous fun big sister, but not a mother. She'll try to be Anna's friend, take her to rock concerts, and shop with her for trendy clothes but be afraid to discipline lest she lose favor. Also, the relationship formed between Jackie and Isabel is probably pretty unrealistic, cancer or not. Core feelings of jealousy in ex marital situations are VERY difficult to overcome (other than on screen), even for a dying woman coming to grips with the best interests of her children. The unpleasant relationship between the two women early in the movie is alas, the norm.The film implies that Jackie is misguided in her original thinking, that Isabel with her career cannot possibly care for her children as competently as she can, as a full time homemaker. Sorry, but I think Jackie has something of a point. She has no choice since she's dying, but in truth, these children's interests would be better served if they were raised by their full time, obviously devoted biological mother, as opposed to their career oriented step mom. Isabel may be portrayed as the 'nicer' of the two women here, but realistically she will have her hands full with a new husband and two new step children (one a teenager), plus her photography career. Something's probably going to come up on the short end of the stick, let's hope it's her job rather than these kids.Nice, touching story, but I grow weary of the trivializing of full time motherhood, and of films that portray divorce scenarios all warm and fuzzy, as this one does in the end. The children are not 'resilient' at all, but generally the ongoing victims for years and years, dealing with two homes and various step people. Society doesn't need movies conveying that really, if everyone works hard at it, divorce ends up fine for the kids. All too often it doesn't.",Stepmom
35,rowmorg,Plagiarised crowd-pleasing tear-jerker is emotional pornography,2,21 September 2009,"I wish there was a law against making these big-budget soppy pictures with nauseating children and syrupy music. I know there's a market for three-hanky flicks and Chris Columbus (his company name: 1492) is a Spielberg protégé out to make money not history, but give us a break. Do people really exchange snippets of cracker-barrel wisdom from morning until night? Evidently the half-dozen unknown writers who worked on this derivative script thought so, but I beg to differ.Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts ploughed some of their hugely-inflated earnings into this crowd-pleaser, but no amount of emoting by Sarandon can overcome the sad fact that her character looks about 15 years too old to have a seven year-old child. She resembles his grandma. Moreover, her character exists in limbo, with no friends, mother, or other rellies to hold her hand while her nightmarishly dick-headed and sanctimonious husband makes out with a lenser half his age. That's what you get for marrying a lawyer, I guess.What gives me the creeps about this film? It's the emotional pornography. Just as porno publicises acts of privacy, this movie probes into emotionally intimate moments, e.g. when a child asks innocently: ""Are you dying?"" In a truthful treatment, perhaps it would be tolerable, but in the glitzy context of a money-making vehicle, sorry, that's invasive and unpleasant.Significantly, the film-makers' slip of moral judgement concerns sex, when Julia Roberts's adulterous character spouts off-colour material at her 12 year-old putative step-daughter, and her misjudged words are endorsed and validated in the subsequent action. On the other hand, hypocritically, not the slightest whiff of the frenzied sexual activity that ostensibly drove this adultery appears in the film.I enjoyed the attitude of the 12 year-old daughter (Jena Malone) to her father's tart, and I cheered at every one of her well-aimed taunts, and those at her father as well (Ed Harris). Dad: ""You don't walk out on your mother."" Daughter: ""No, that's your job."" I never once believed the relationship depicted between the adulterous lawyer and his gormless young marriage-buster, and found his imposition of her on his suffering ex-wife to be spoiled and self-centred, although the movie thoroughly endorsed his behaviour.Of course the whole charade is an elaborate hoax. In the vast majority of such cases, when a father departs with a spring chicken, leaving the menopausal mother in the lurch, he is rarely or never seen again. The ones who cruelly attempt to bring mother and mistress together usually get egg all over their faces. This is largely phony trash, avoid carefully.",Stepmom

38,cosmic_quest,"Good plot, terrible characters",5,7 May 2006,"'Stepmom' had the potential to be a good film, tackling such meaty issues like terminal illness, parental loss and step-parenting, but to actively engage the audience with such a plot you need to have interesting and likable characters. Sadly, this was an ingredient this film lacked.The film centres on divorced couple Jackie and Luke and their two children, twelve-year-old Anna and seven-year-old Ben. Luke is engaged to be married to vivacious, career-woman Isabel and neither his ex-wife nor his children are exactly pleased for him. But when Jackie is diagnose with terminal breast cancer, she forces herself to befriend Isabel and attempts to groom her to take over as 'mother' when she eventually dies.I think Susan Sarandon is an excellent actress but in this film, I just loathed her character of Jackie. I'm a female so I usually I can empathise with the female characters in films like this and how they must feel as if they are being cast aside by the father of their children to make way for a younger, bubblier woman. But Jackie is someone who I found very hard to identify with; she was just so brash, rude and indulged the children to the point where they were spoilt rotten. In one scene, Ben wanders off while in Isabel's care and when found instead of comforting him then scolding him for going off by himself, Jackie is too intent on placing full blame on Isabel when surely this child should be disciplined too. Jena Malone's Anna is, quite frankly, just a self-centred brat. She is obnoxious and desperately in need of a good shaking but it's no wonder she is like this given her parents let her away with murder. Then there is Ben, who is played by the adorable little Liam Aiken. However, cuteness aside, this child is startlingly egotistical that his precociousness is wearing after a while.Luke, played by Ed Harris, comes off slightly better although the character does seem weak and rather a push-over, never ready to stand up to Jackie or clamp down on the cocky madam that is Anna. In fact, it is Julia Roberts' Isabel who is the only really likable character in the film as she strives to not only help the children accept her but willingly agrees to Jackie's plan to step in as the maternal figure.That said, the final scenes are poignant as we see the children cope with their mother's inevitable death and how the unconventional family finally band together when times get tough. A bit more trouble could have been spared to actually make Susan Sarandon look terminally ill; in this film, she looked as healthy as an ox.As I said, the plot is intriguing but there are other films which have done it and done it better. Check them out before coming back to this.",Stepmom

I am so glad that my husband and I both married for the first time and remain married after twenty-one years. I am not sure if I would nor could put up with Jackie's insults and two step kids, specially Anna.  The interesting part in the movie is that in fairy tails the step mom is mean and the mom is the ""nice to every person,"" in this movie,  to the contrary,  mom is nice to her kids, but wicked to everybody else around. It takes some doing to get that mean, I think. Unfortunately I have met people just like that! Unbelievable! 	The photography is nice! I like a movie that shows the changing of seasons! I just love the change of seasons. But when fall is coming in this movie, Jackie finds out that she has cancer.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with this, since movies are targeted as a matter of course... who do you think goes to see ""Spiderman"" or ""Terminator 2?""The movie is effective at tearjerking, and (as usual) emotions are somewhat manipulated here... again, nothing any more wrong with it than triggering an adrenaline rush when Yoda stands up and waves his lightsabre.  Many times, people go to movies to feel emotions and to get a cathartic release.  I did find myself teary-eyed at the appropriate moments... the film has high production values and good acting, and I allowed myself to get involved in this one.I agree with previous viewers that Susan Sarandon's character is mostly annoying (although with occasional moments of brilliance).  I'm pretty sure this is both intentional and scripted to be that way.  I like Sarandon, and especially in the film ""Dead Man Walking"" (I thought she was superb).  The script of ""Stepmom"" is very mainstream Hollywood, but not in a ""bad way."" It's certainly better than a soap opera (which gives nobody catharsis, only voyeuristic addiction to phony stories).Overall, an entertaining family film in the genre of others like ""Ordinary People,"" ""Table For Five"" and others.

47,zfiany,Waw. This is a movie!,9,30 March 2009,"It is a movie that highlights the warmth of a mother's heart and hug. A movie that keeps one question coming up constantly on your mind: why should we deal with so much pains? This movie is full with emotions that your heart is going to welcome deeply and embrace them with pain. The main character is Susan Sarandon for no other character in the movie was capable of approaching her brilliance and performance. Through Susan's character we see a woman who is still in love with her husband, has to accept a new woman in his life and this same woman is competing with her on the love of her children. Not only that, she later discovers that she has cancer! Then, all the emotions of love, loss, death expectations and friendship, rise to the top and stir your feelings crazily.There are two particular scenes in the movie that are brilliantly directed by Chirs Columbus and performed by Sarandon: 1) the scene when Sarandon wakes up her daughter and gives her a ride on the horse (brilliant acting and beautiful music) 2) the scene when Sarandon watches her children starting to love Julia Roberts and she plays feelings of contradiction in her eyes where she is jealous and at the same time they must have a replacement after she goes. This scene shows the great performer Susan Sarandon is.It is a very deep story that anyone who didn't like has really missed its meanings.",Stepmom

But, guess what? None of you! Despite that you have the courage to say that Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris are not to able to recite, they are bad actors!? You're embarrassing yourself! Are you really so self righteous? You should be ashamed of yourself! You're absolutely idiots!This movie is more than decent, the actors are great. It was possible to save something and maybe, at a certain point, writing something different, but it worked even in this way.

49,jaddison383,Very Beautiful,6,19 January 2007,"I got Stepmom for Julia Robert's performance, and I expected it to be pretty good. It did not fail me- it exceeded my expectations. This movie is beautiful.It's the story of a husband and wife with two kids who have fallen out of love, and now the father is getting married to a new, younger woman. The mother of the kids does everything she can to make her children hate this woman who is going to very soon be a permanent part of their life.Julia Roberts indeed gives a fine performance as the fiancée of Ed Harris, the husband. She steals your heart in every scene she's in as this young woman who is trying so hard to be exactly what those children want and need. And in the end, she's searching for acceptance and love from them as much as they are from her. And then there's Susan Sarandon, giving one of her best performances as the mother of the children who wants nothing more than to remove her children from The younger woman completely. Sarandon's character is horrible- one of the most awful and hateful people in modern movies. She backstabs, she's overly-critical, and for a long time, she finds every chance possible to turn her children against the other woman- yet you cannot help but feel for her. As nasty as she is, you sympathize with this woman who is having to deal with her children being in the care of a younger, inexperienced woman who is living with her ex-husband. It's impossible not to understand her character's mourning and confusion. For the first time in her life, this woman is not the only mother in her children's life.Don't be surprised if you cry- more than once. It's that good, and that affecting. Truly, this film is one of the better delights of the past few years. Beautiful story, great performances, real emotions- 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",Stepmom

""Stepmom"" is the most emotional and heartwarming film I've ever seen.  Julia Roberts was excellent, but my focus was mostly on Susan Sarandon's character, who gives this film that emotional atomosphere, but always still puts a smile on your face.So, if you're a very sentimental person, don't forget to have a box of tissues near you when you watch this film!

The arc of fairly stereotypical characters without great personalities. Although they are not the best interpretations of Sarandon and Roberts, they achieve a nice chemistry that crosses and projects good bonds in the course.It is not a genius or a work of art nor is it expected to be, it is from those movies to watch as a family and that leaves a cute flavor with a small realistic detail.",Stepmom

YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! and charged out to the box office in search of my $6.50. Instead I sat and watched a hour and a half more of the of the pat, unbelievable family-relations scenarios to pass the silver screen. Ed Harris acts out the second most popular mens' fantasy involving two women--that is, a first wife acquiescing in, and eventually blessing, her replacement by a younger version of herself.

Ed Harris is around long enough to establish that he exists (with an unfortunate scene that's shot showing the top of his balding head as he and Julia-playing-Julia make out).The kids acting in this are some of the best child actors I've seen in a mainstream Hollywood picture. Too bad the movie is so...everything you'd expect.We start out knowing Sarandon's character is terminally ill. There would have been much more dramatic tension if we had followed Julia's path in finding out what was going on.But why talk plot? The only redeeming bits were a few choice bits of dialogue, Sarandon's acting, some eye candy on Julia's day job, and Jena Malone's perfect capturing of a tween's acting out. The rest was tedious bilge; no, ""tedious"" is too generous. Mostly just unaffecting. Easy to fast forward through. And the pious speech-making was totally over the top. Compare this plot development and dialogue with ""The Family Stone,"" for instance (a similar Formula Film), and the latter shows how much more can be achieved with so much less.",Stepmom
55,beejer,Another variation of the dad leaves mom for a younger woman theme,7,10 July 1999,"I have mixed feelings about this film. Although it's another variation of the dad leaves mom for a younger woman theme, the superior acting of the principles carries it off. Susan Sarandon as the ex-wife and Julia Roberts as dad's new love interest are excellent, as are Jena Malone and Liam Atkin as the children. Ed Harris as the husband has little to do but flash his pearly whites and dimples. Lynn Whitfield, a vastly underrated and beautiful actress, is wasted as Sarandon's doctor.On the other hand, I find it difficult to imagine two beautiful women such as Ms. Roberts and Ms. Sarandon fighting over Ed Harris.I also find it hard to believe that the average American family has two successful professionals earning high six figure(or more)salaries, an ex-wife jetting around the country for expensive cancer treatments that most of us couldn't afford, maintaining two large estates and driving two Land Rovers and a Mercedes.Having said all of that, I did give the movie a ""7"" based on the superior screenplay and acting of the four principals mentioned above.",Stepmom

57,Laitue_Gonflable,"Sappy, manipulative drivel",2,16 July 2006,"I usually try to be objective when I watch films, to appreciate their technical merit above all else, but in the case of Stepmom, I fail. It's exactly the sort of puffy, ridiculous Valium that Hollywood shamelessly pumps into growing generations of cynics to brainwash them into the belief that every person in the world is a cuddly, fluffy elf-like creature and conflict only exists because it's been too long since we all sat down for a singalong around the piano.I know I sound like a terrible cynic for judging this film in this way (I am a terrible cynic, let's not deny it), but it's difficult to swallow this tripe. I come from a - dare I use that devilish phrase - broken home myself and in fact my old man is getting remarried very soon, but I still fail to see any resemblance between Chris Columbus' vision of family harmonics and the interpersonal dynamics that exist here on Earth. And by that I refer both to the grating, fire-and-brimstone conflict at the beginning of the film and the sugary hug fest into which it slowly descends as it progresses.There is however, nothing inherently wrong with sugary, optimistic scenarios; if they are grounded, well-driven, well-plotted explorations of discovering the light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard for me to put my finger on a perfect example but the most obvious one would have to be the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which has nevertheless received a certain quantity of criticism from yours truly for drawing too distinct a line between ""good"" and ""bad"". In spite of that trilogy's shortcomings though, it's a good example of a golden-sunshine-lollipops conclusion that is plodded out solidly over a long arduous journey of storytelling.Chris Columbus here dispenses with any nuance of hard work, or respect for his audience's intelligence, and dishes up a glib, emotionally manipulative treat for us to wolf down hungrily, starved for happy endings in our cinematic universe of chainsaw massacres and David Lynch.There really isn't a saving grace to this film, as far as I can see: Its lack of realism obviously renders me incapable of truly appreciating whatever fine qualities it may have, but the dialogue is dull, performances are average and being such a suburban story, there really isn't much room for technical film-making brilliance. On top of this, every single time I think back on it I get ""Ain't no Mountain High Enough"" stuck interminably in my head, and that, more than anything else, is unforgivable.2/10",Stepmom
58,Rozinda,Depressing movie,6,15 October 2009,"I really didn't like this movie. I felt Julia Roberts was completely miscast even though she acts so excellently as always. I didn't like that yellow hair - was it a wig? It made her look about 12 - seemed very inappropriate beside the very much middle aged adulterer who's her lover. His strenuous attempts to keep up with his young girlfriend are embarrassing as it is without her looking a teenager.I don't like this adultery theme anyway - although clearly it had to be in the story as developed. The relationship between Roberts and the adulterous husband doesn't work at all - heaven knows what she'd see in her old lover given she appears to be meant to be so young. Roberts certainly did her very best, but there's no spark at all between her and the actor who played her lover. Every time these two appeared together I hoped to see the Roberts character tell him she was dumping him for a more worthy and attractive and younger guy but she didn't. Inexplicably, she appeared to like being with him.So that was a bad start. And of course, given the theme, Roberts had to stay with the guy.This story's saving graces were the always attractive and watchable (in spite of the hair) Roberts doing her best with an unsympathetic part and Sarandon doing an excellent job as the dying mother/cheated wife. Whilst I didn't like the story, these two on screen together or apart were excellent. We didn't need the boring husband/lover at all except he happens to be father to his ex-wife's kids.Towards the end of the movie, as the mother was more and more sick, I simply gave up watching. I really wasn't into watching mother and mistress with selfish husband now having them both trapped together under the same roof and him able to live there too, whilst mother dies gradually on screen and the kids have to cope with this rather nauseating menage a trois. I guess it was worth a try making a movie with this theme and sometimes it works, sometimes not. Don't be put off by my comments if the theme interests you because the ladies act so well. You can much of the time ignore the male jerk in the middle.The mistress realises she is going to have to cope with her lover's kids after his wife is gone even though not wanting to have children herself. The kids play her up, and are clearly distressed in the early part of the movie by their father's to them hurtful and also embarrassing behaviour with this young woman. It was neat though very depressing to time the story so that the cheated wife has to live through watching her replacement taking over because she herself is dying, rather than the more conventional new wife turning up after mother's dead to take over rebellious miserable kids. It makes for a tear-jerker if this is your kind of movie. I turned the movie off about 15 mins before the end. I decided there wasn't going to be any kind of ""surprise"" and I'd had enough of the selfish ""I want it all"" husband and the poor dying woman.One of those movies I wish I hadn't bothered to watch. 7 stars for the acting of the kids and the ladies.

Sarandon (the mother we would all like to have) and Roberts (the bimbo one we wouldn't ) prove they have talent in their respective capacities.  The themes are strong ; divorce,raising kids,relationships,mid-life crises,jealousy/envy, etc.  These are approached with candour and life. 
Ed Harris(another brilliant actor) is convincing as the father who's run off with ""a bit of skirt"". Julia Roberts tries her hardest to win the kids (and us)over and is still trying at the end.  Susan Sarandon however sweeps through this picture gracefully leaving us clutching for support at her passing, we feel her pain, her betrayal by her husband and life(for dealing her the incurable disease), we feel her grief when she  cuddles up to her daughter and tries to hold her memories close forever.  We admire her bravery in accepting it all and the new woman in her children's life and she shows this best in the final portrait which puts Roberts as her equal in the family circle.Brilliant acting which only a mother could have carried out.StepMom is a 10/10",Stepmom

62,Criz,A Big Step Backwards,4,6 June 1999,"What is happening to my beloved Columbia? The hallowed studio with the pretty lady logo once stood for quality--for well-crafted films and professionalism.""Stepmom"" is the latest in a string of horrible misjudgments (""Idle Hands"", ""Gloria"", ""8MM""), compounded by the fact that a lead role in the film was given to Susan Sarandon, an amateurish actor of questionable ability. There is not a single moment in this movie where Sarandon does not attempt to draw unnecessary attention to herself.As if one callous, whiny and completely-devoid-of-humanity character weren't enough, Sarandon's Jackie is joined by a daughter, played by Jena Malone. Malone's Anna becomes nauseating even more quickly than Jackie, if that's possible. (Just when I thought I was innoculated against the last batch of misandristic female characters, along comes a new strain.) The sad fact about what could have been an interesting film is that the entire plot is simplified to a Dick and Jane level. Anna and Jackie are portrayed as so cruel and unreasonable, it's impossible to see any value in them at all. Instead of a thoughtful exploration of the issues raised by divorce and remarriage, the film turns into a pep rally for the same old good little girl played by Julia Roberts. It's disheartening that Columbia could only evoke understanding for her character by making the other females cartoonish and stupid.The other disappointing aspect of ""Stepmom"" is its sexist double standard. It's strange how when female characters divorce their spouses and move on, they are usually presented in a heroic light (""Message in a Bottle"", ""The Good Mother"", ""First Wives' Club"") but when a man decides to begin a new life after a divorce, he's portrayed as committing the unpardonable sin.

Having come from a broken family without all the nice puffiness displayed in this film, I went into it thinking I would hate it, resent Hollywood for yet another cumbyah film that is constantly being spit out. I had some time to waste and gave it a go. While some of this film angered me at how pathetically sweet the soon to be stepmom was with the cruel ex wife I must admit I still found this film to be touching and heartfelt in ways I am rarely touched by people films. The way they handled the sickness of the mother and pending death was beautifully written and carried out for audiences. It touched a chord deep within me from losing my own mother and now being ill myself without a partner, kids or any family to lean on for support. The fears shared between the mother and soon to be stepmom started me feeling the ball building in my throat. The fear they both had for the bratty female child's wedding day when she was older. The ball in my throat got larger and larger from that point until I found myself blinking and water running down my cheek. It surprised me especially because I went into this film knowing I would hate it but hate it I did not.

69,cineastFGD,Most awful movie ever,1,26 November 2014,"I'm a huge fan of Julia Roberts, for me she's one of the last remaining great Hollywood icons. However, this film is probably one of the most dreadful movies I've ever seen and it's really beyond me how she could every agree to act in this movie. Something that really made me hate the movie, is the completely uncritically displayed behaviour of the father. There is just one word for such a guy and that is 'jerk'. He does not take care of his sick ex-wife, he does not take care of his kids, and he destroys the most promising career of a young woman, just to replace his boring and wrinkled wife with a younger model. Of course the new girlfriend steps in when the Mum needs treatment and Daddy is absent again (wonder why he can afford two enormously expensive houses but no babysitter), sure she even looses her job over this, and sure she's the selfless angel that meets every insult and bad mouthed comment with a smile, that throws away a successful career for someone else's kids; just because of looove. What a terrible and outdated gender cliché, and I'm sure no one over 16 will buy this story.If you haven't already been nauseated by this plot, you surly will be by the tacky dialogues and scenes, which if it wasn't enough already, are sugarcoated with a non-stop layer of cheesy background music. This film leaves you with the feeling of sticky caramel between your teeth and of a disgusting overdose of sugary candy in your mental stomach. The cancer illness of the mother is portrayed so believably as if a 40 BMI person was dying of anorexia. Seems like dying of cancer is just a piece of cake and mostly a matter of lying elegantly in some chair wrapped in a shawl. This is probably the most pathetic part of the movie.

Julia Roberts replies by saying imagine how *she* is going to feel in the future, when the girl is getting married and can only think about how she wishes it was her mother and not her stepmother there to help with her wedding.I guess the screenwriter really expects us to swallow this. Sure, yeah, the REAL tragedy is that the new trophy wife will lack confidence. Come on Mom, quit feeling sorry for yourself!

Both deal with a mother dying of cancer and a family in turmoil.  The difference between the two, however, is that One True Thing was much more of a melancholy movie than Stepmom was.  Stepmom has moments of comedy and excitement.  This takes some of the pressure off people who are prone to crying during dramas. The thing about Stepmom that stands out very well, is the superb acting by the ENTIRE cast.  The adults as well as the kids did a great job in their roles, and that alone made this already great movie outstanding.

Far from being happy to be left with her two ""adorable"" children, Sarandon complains constantly - though her ex-husband seemed perfectly non-descript - but of course he was very caring really! An eye-opener on how the upbringing of children is perceived in the USA - apparently they have to be consulted about anything the parents to - even dying! When a tearful Mom tells the kids she has cancer, the 12 year old daughter starts screaming, because Mom has lied by not revealing her illness earlier (!!!!!) Hard to believe, isn't it? Although I suppose it is really a transfer of anguish. Similarly, it is apparently quite usual for 12 year olds to have boyfriends at school!! The parents when they hear of the kids' love-life (i won't go into the tedious details) don't say ""Perhpas you should be studying"", but just give ""helpful"" advice. I was riveted by the whole thing; I think it is meant to be a three handkerchief weepy, but I mainly laughed at all the peculiar behavior.

I think it's a big responsibility of film makers to start changing that image.  Make movie kids behave the way real children SHOULD, not the way the bad ones ""do"".  The spoiled obnoxious daughter in this film made me so angry I wanted to spank the actress!!!",Stepmom

The script by itself is good, and the cast made the movie even better. Julia Roberts as always is wonderful. Susan Sarandon made you sympathise with her characters situation.I must really rave about the young actor Jena Malone who I've never seen before. She was great. Most of the tears in the movie came from her. The young boy Liam Aiken got quite a bit of laughs.It's just a lovely movie, with no nasty scenes in it.",Stepmom
80,movieboy-6,The year's best film,10,8 January 1999,"I am really at a loss of words.  This is without a doubt one of the most touching movies I've ever seen.  Better than ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Steel Magnolias"", ""Stepmom"" promises tears (or for guys like me, a slight mist).  Julia Roberts is my all-time favorite actress anyway; I would gladly pay the $6.00 to watch a movie in which she did nothing but sit on the floor and eat raisin bran.  Then I would sing its praises and probably see it again when it became available at rentals.  I will set aside my bias and say that Susan Sarandon deserves the Best Actress nom. because she was undoubtedly amazing, but people could identify more, I think, with Roberts whose performance as the stepmother-to-be was phenomenal.  My dear Julia, however, is said to be without a nomination for either category, which makes me mad enough to spit nails; but that's neither here nor there.  I wrote this to tell you to go see this excellent tearjerker ASAP, so get off your lazy as* and go see it.  You can still catch the 10:15 if you hurry! A+",Stepmom

82,Capri,"Mediocre fare, at best.",4,10 January 1999,"With two of my favorite actresses involved, I still found it to be a very disappointing movie. In the first part, Susan Sarandon was overbearing, demanding, and petty so it was difficult to feel an appropriate response of sympathy when it was called for:  I found it difficult to try to care about what happened to her.  Julia Roberts was whiney or in tears over every snide remark or slight.  The only time I felt emotionally involved was when the two women finally sat down face to face and discussed their views of what a wedding day may bring.  Ed Harris was believable as the man in the middle, the son was adorable and the daughter should have had so many time-outs she'd still be in the corner!",Stepmom
83,alvispotter-1,so sad and so good!,10,9 November 2009,"God, i can't believe this movie is rated 6.2. It should at least be rated 7.5, and it could even be 8.5!Let's just say this movie is the one that has moved me and made me cry the most in my whole life. Well, moved me in a sad way.I don't know what kind of ability Susan Sarandon's got, but all she did in this movie made me cry. She's such a good actress, and this movie suits her perfectly.I've never been much of a Julia Roberts' fan, considering i find Notting Hill and pretty woman kind of boring, but i loved her in this movie, how she really tries to bond with the kids and Susan to get to the point where the kids almost rather being with her than with their mom. Julia gives her best, in my opinion, she is a very good actress as well. Drama suits her.The kids are the other thing that gives movie that amazing flavor. How the girl answer to Susan, Julia and her dad is just so sad and good. Klaus Baudelaire's actor is so small and great as the little kid, who knows enough of the situation and gives the movie it's nice and happy moment.I didn't think the husband was anything important.And, of course, what makes this movie as sad and as great as it is, is the incredible directing of Chris Columbus, who directed two of the movies of my favorite movie series and book series: Harry Potter. I don't know why, but he's just got this gift for directing. Oh god, when i saw it i didn't know it was Columbus', and when i realized i now know why it's great.Some may say it's melodramatic, but i wouldn't agree. It's just good drama, one of those were you can't stop crying but that has a good plot involved as well.Bottom line, loved it. Very enjoyable and i recommend it highly. Good job Columbus, as usual.",Stepmom

85,helen-15,Emotionally manipulative unrealistic use of wonderful Sarandon's time,4,2 January 1999,"Seven members of my family went to see this movie at Christmas, because of an admiration for the cast and because of a divorce/remarriage situation within our family.  We left disappointed on both levels.  Although Sarandon and Roberts are wonderful (Harris seems to be phoning it in) the movie is too thin and unrealistic to support these women.  In summary, an ex-wife reluctantly accepts the role of her ex-husband's new fiancee in her children's lives, then learns to appreciate her when a crisis occurs.  There is potential, but the answers provided are too easy and lack context. Particuarly disappointing was the lack of context for all of these people. Where were the  grandparents, the siblings, the girlfriends?  If they were such great women, they should certainly have had more people in their lives. Without any context, the relationship between the two women is completely unrealistic.  The movie also goes inevitably for the melodrama and tears, without exploring elements of the changes in these people's lives which could have been more interesting.  There are far too many tearful scenes with the children, and far too few that demonstrate real understanding of life's difficulties, and particularly the challenges that the children face. I wish there were better scripts out there for these women.",Stepmom

(this is something I took note of, anyway)(the only slight gripe I have with this film is that I find the children a little bit annoying, but this is only a very minor thing)Overall, Excellent, It never fails to move me to tears, Everytime I watch it!, Glorious is the word!

89,El Queso Loco,"Overall a great movie, but has many flaws...",9,17 March 2000,"For starters the mother (Jackie Harrison played by Susan Sarandon) is just horridly mean to nearly everyone around her, I ended up completely hating the character and waiting for her to die already, which I would HOPE was not the intention of the film. She did soften up considerably at the end, but it was too little too late as far as I'm concerned. The daughter (Anna Harrison played by Jena Malone) was a snot-nosed brat who I wanted to strangle at times, but also cooled off and much better than her mother's character.Most of the background including the dad (Luke Harrison played by Ed Harris) seemed to disappear from the film completely as it started to center around the two women fighting for/over these two children. The rock and roll songs were nice (a bit repetetive but Im sure Sonny and Cher fans will like it) but the score was inappropriate and its better to just tune it out.All that being said this is STILL a great movie, an 8 or 9/10. Very touching story with good heart, even if it dosen't get its point across too well at times. The little boy (Ben Harrison played by Liam Aiken) is VERY cute and funny, a very promising young actor. But by far the best thing in this movie is Julia Roberts as Isabel Kelly. She has it all in this film and simply steals the show. If she performed this good all the time more people would take her seriously.If you ever feel the need to cry, smile, or simply hate a character and yell at the screen, give this move a chance. :)",Stepmom
90,concord-4,Look out! The PTA might complain about this movie...,2,30 June 1999,"This poorly written film contains ridiculous exposition to link together the often contrived scenes.  Here are some examples:#1  When Julia Roberts phones Harper Collins, a major New York publisher, a senior editor answers the phone.  Hmm, I guess the receptionist was too busy editing the screenplay for Stepmom.#2  Later in the film, Julia Roberts discovers a personal letter written by a friend of Susan Sarandon on Harper Collins letterhead.  Wow!  It really doesn't appear that that Harper Collins is running a very tight ship!#3  After the 12 year old daughter in the film embarrasses an ex-boyfriend by pretending to date a high-school aged model, Susan Sarandon yells at Julia Roberts for allowing this incident to take place because she's ""gonna have to deal with the numerous complaints at the PTA as a result of this incident"".  Huh?  What?????#4  The 12 year old daughter (who was 4 during Pearl Jam's heyday) is giddy to see cynical grunge-rockers Pearl Jam WITH HER MOM.

92,rainbow11,"Though your candle shines on others, it does not shine less on you.",10,3 May 2000,"One of the best character studies I have ever seen. A film that handles the ""divorce"" subject without the cliche's, giving a seldom approached solution for healing a broken heart. Excellently brings out the emotional challenges a family has when the parents divorce.The husband is living with a younger woman.  The 12 yr. old daughter senses her mother's pain & rejects the girlfriend. The mother tries to control her bitterness for the sake of her children, but can't really get a grip. The father trying to keep peace between all of them. And then the younger woman (Julia Roberts) does all that she can to try and be a ""part"" and not the ""other woman"" that's destroying a family.Usually in such a film, you're cheering for the ""dumped"" partner, and ""boo""ing the other one. But not in ""Stepmom"". You have the feeling like, ""Hey, I can relate to everybody's point of view here.""  The actors also have to get the credit. They did a marvellous job of portraying their characters.The message? With a bit of time, patience and trying to understand, unselfish love can change any situation and heal any pain.  It shows how forgiveness makes these changes possible & shows the benefits you receive in recognizing the mistakes you yourself have made. To accept the outcome, to accept people's choices rather than fight against them.  To put the happiness of those you say you love, first, and then joy replaces your misery.I don't know if there is such a thing as a ""perfect"" movie, but this one sure comes close.",Stepmom

If the characters aren't arguing in the movie, they are crying. Then the writers have to add *spoiler* the whole cancer thing just to make the audience feel sorry and end up crying in the end. That's one thing I hate about movies is when they try to make you feel sad instead of using real emotions and situations to make real drama. It's just one big piece of crap.",Stepmom
94,PugsMom,"Very Entertaining, but no Oscar winner",9,16 January 2001,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts give excellent performances as the mother and stepmother of two highly likable kids. Ed Harris's performance is kind of flat, but I blame this more on the script than on his ability as an actor. The story is about how a family reacts to one divorced parent getting remarried, in this case Ed Harris and Julia Roberts move in together and it causes tensions for everyone. Sarandon and the kids start out hating Isobel (Roberts) to the point that Sarandon (I keep forgetting her character's name) doesn't even want Isobel to be alone with the children. The story is very real. I can only imagine how an ex-wife would feel when her husband moves in with another woman. I have personally lived the role of the children. My father got remarried to a beautiful, younger woman when I was growing up and I wasn't particularly thrilled. The children in the movie remain fiercely loyal to their mother and adopt her attitudes about Isobel. At one point the son says to Sarandon something like, ""I can hate her (Isobel) if you want me to."" What makes the movie so real is that while Sarandon and Isobel eventually become civil with one another, they never become best friends. If they had the film would have lost all credibility with me.(SPOILER ALERT, although this plotline is in all the reviews) Sarandon's character has cancer and as the films goes on we begin to understand that Isobel will end of being more than just a STEPmother. While her relationship starts out on a bad note with the kids, (especially the daughter) it's a no-brainer that as the movie goes on she'll win their hearts. But it's the way she wins their hearts that's very believable. It doesn't happen overnight. I did have a problem with Sarandon's bitchiness toward Isobel. She was relentless. In one scene Isobel asks Sarandon if she could take the daughter to a Pearl Jam concert on a school night, as a way to try and get closer to her. Sarandon says no. A few scenes later Sarandon whips out tickets to the concert right in front of Isobel and snottily says to her, ""Thanks. It was a great idea."" This kind of thing, while believable, didn't endear me to Sarandon, and at that point in the film if was time for her to change her attitude.All five actors give excellent performances and as I said, the plot is very believable. This film has everything: comedy, drama, romance, family values. I highly recommend it to anyone, but it will really hit home with people who've lived through a similar situations.",Stepmom
95,JB-48,Moving drama with a great performance by Julia Roberts,7,10 January 1999,"I waited a good three weeks after Stepmom premiered before I seen it.  The previews made it seem a bit to sickeningly sweet.  Well, after seeing the movie, I have to report that it is sickeningly sweet.  But, I liked it anyway.The story predictably tugs at all the right heartstrings.  Not only does it milk the stepmother situation for all it's worth, but it also throws in a terminal disease for good measure.What saves this movie from mediocrity are the characters and the performances.Everyone is appealing.  Ed Harris does his typical class act job. Although for the most part, his job seems to be just staying out of the way of the two female leads.  The two female leads do a wonderful job.  Julia Roberts brings beauty and humor to her role.  Susan Sarandon brings dignity and class to hers.  They make a good match.The actors playing the kids are exceptional.  Jena Malone, as the daughter/ step-daughter does a particularly wonderful job.  There are moments in the movie where you'd like to slap her, and there are others where your heart really goes out to her.This type of movie is not generally the kind of movie I'd go for.  Normally I like car chases and aliens.  But, this sweet little movie was able to hold my interest and occasionally have me feel for the characters.A small winner.  7 out of 10.",Stepmom
96,xphile63,The Cheesiest Movie Alive,2,11 July 2001,"*Minor spoilers ahead*Julia Roberts strikes again!  Basically, this film is a big ol' sticky wad of total melodrama about a bunch of snobby, spoiled rich people throwing tantrums whenever they don't get their own way.  It's supposed to teach the audience something about growing up and bonding with stepparents and coping with divorce and terminal illness and a whole slew of other things, but in the end it's just stupid, contrived and stereotypical.  All three of the female characters (Jackie, Isobel and Anna) are self-absorbed, rude and manipulative and the younger child (I forget his name) is supposed to be all cute and handsome and charismatic and blah-de-blah but instead he quickly becomes annoying.  Anyway, the plot basically goes round and round in circles for the first forty-five minutes and then the writers realized that it wasn't going anywhere and decided to deal the Tearjerking Terminal Illness(tm) card just to wrap it up.  So they have Susan Sarandon's character get cancer, resulting in a half-million Heartwrenching Goodbye Sequences(tm) which ultimately bring the family closer together.  I have a lot of respect for many of the actors in this film, but in all honesty, the film itself was way too cheesy for me to stomach (no pun intended).  If you're a big fan of any of the actors, it's probably worth it, though.",Stepmom
97,lemlems-374-917116,"A weepie, but a good one",9,15 January 2019,"This isn't my sort of film at all - I normally don't go for weepies - but I found I really loved it. Mostly that's due to Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts, who are both excellent, but also because it's an interesting and moving take on family roles, relationships and clashes.I've seen quite a few reviewers on here slate the film because they didn't like how the characters behaved or the choices they made (especially the father). I think that misses the point of the film. It's true, none of the characters are faultless - they lash out when they're hurt or scared, they sometimes set bad examples for the children, they make selfish mistakes because they're afraid and they get stuck in roles that they've adopted and then complain about them.
In other words they're human - messily, brokenly human and they have messy, difficult relationships. For me that's one of the strengths of the film, not a weakness, and I think all the cast do a good job of making the characters still sympathetic, even though they don't always behave well.In the end what I really love about this film is the development of the film's central relationship between Sarandon and Roberts. The relationship is adversarial at first with the two women at loggerheads because the ex-wife still feels hurt by the breakdown of her marriage and defensive about a new woman in her children's life, while the girlfriend resents living in the shadow of her boyfriend's previous relationship and being rejected by his children. Added to that the two are very different women with different values - so what sort of example is being set for the children is also a bone of contention.
The two women are gradually negotiating their way through that minefield when the ex-wife's cancer prognosis forces them to communicate and find common ground for the sake of the children.It's an unashamedly soppy ode to the strong relationships women can develop when they aren't competing over men and is genuinely moving. The closing shot of the film is a real tearjerker and makes all the rows and misunderstandings that went before worthwhile",Stepmom
98,EllaMalias,Cop-out,3,14 January 2008,"I found this movie disappointing. The battle between the ex-wife/mom and the new, younger girlfriend could have been a good movie. I don't appreciate that cancer in the family brings people together and functions as a shortcut to resolving conflict. Susan Sarandon ends up passing the torch gracefully to her replacement mom, Julia Roberts. It just seems too morally perfect. I found it sappy. But, of course, how can they resent each other when Susan Sarandon is dying, right? Hopefully, in reality, people find reasons other than grave illness to treat each other with respect and move on from a conflict. There's something either very romantic or very cynical about the movie's implication that mortal illness brings out the best in someone.",Stepmom

I have seen it in the theatre 9 times, and look VERY forward to it coming out on video on April 27th. Susan Sarandon did a FABULOUS job on this movie. Her passion really let out on this one. Julia Roberts also did an incredible job, but I have to say Susan blew this one over the top. Liam Aiken was a sweetie, but Jena Malone I did not like. A good actress, but yet too bratty. (No offense) Ed Harris was great also, as he always is, such a great man. Crying all 9 times, this movie is a real tear jerker, and being 13 years old I don't cry that often. But this is very sad, be sure to bring tissues, you'll regret it if you don't. This is an incredible movie, and it should have been nominated for an Oscar, but unfortunately it didn't.

101,esorge,Hard to Watch,7,18 October 2006,"This movie is kind of hard to watch, mainly because I hate Susan Sarandon's character. She's mean-spirited, self-righteous, and self-centered. She's mad at her ex-husband, so she takes it out on Julia Roberts' character. This is understandable, but she does it at the expense of her children's well-being. She basically makes her family dysfunctional. When she finally dies of cancer, I don't feel bad for her. I feel bad for her kids. They're okay, although the girl is sometimes extremely unlikable. What bothers me is, they act like everything is okay because Susan Sarandon's character is dying. That would not happen in real life. That said, the movie is overall good. It's not boring, and it's touching if you can forget what a horrible person the mother is.",Stepmom

These characters are rich, spoiled and uninteresting, and you really don't care what happens to them. They live in beautiful homes (why couldn't they be REAL people?) and seem to have no problems except for the tension between Sarandon, Roberts and Jena Malone.

A woman who has sunk so deep into the role of supporter that she has trouble admitting to her family that she needs to be on the receiving end for once.I loved the relationship she had developed with her son - too often children in films are merely props, and there's rarely the depth and individuality expressed in this film.Julia Roberts was hilarious as the fiancee/career woman who is more used to last-minute creative solutions than planning ahead.   I would like to have seen her character developed a little more outside of the family ties......Friends?  Family?  Interests other than photography?Ed Harris's role was a travesty......his influence was practically non-existent other than to explain why Sarandon & Roberts couldn't get rid of each other.  I was disappointed that his character was allowed to be so translucent.   It  takes a lot of courage and strength to create a strong friendship out of a failed marriage - the respect, love and character that must exist to hold that bond were only hinted at, and I wonder if his gentle masculine influence was eclipsed intentionally to give ""strong female"" roles more screen time.By the way - for those who were wondering about snowblowing......think Altoids.",Stepmom

""Stepmom"" began in a similar light tone, but quickly developed into a thick drama.  I thought that Julia Roberts pulled off the part extremely well.  Susan Sarandon's portrayal as Jackie was excellent.The story was believable.   The main characters of Isabel and Jackie were both developed indepth.  The cruelty of Jackie and Anna towards Isabel could be discomforting at times!In the end, I had great respect for both characters for their remarkable abilities to overcome adversity, although in very different manners.Not to give it away, but Luke's technique of proposing marriage was extremely creative.  Wish that I had thought of it first!  I also enjoyed Jackie's Victorian style house.The drama became very thick and moving towards the end.   I couldn't help but to shed a tear at the climactic Christmas giftgiving scene.Overall, I thought that the movie was very good, and would strongly recommend it.

112,oxodave,excellent comedy/drama movie,7,28 June 2005,This movie is basically a fraction of how life can be that is why people can get into it and get emotionally evolved in the story. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandons performance is excellent in my eyes it isn't the usual part for Sarandon or Roberts for that matters but they both stand out.Sarandon manages to annoy you in the beginning and at the end feel sorry for her. It is a great family movie and it also has it's good comedy moments. I definitely recommend it to everybody who likes true life movies. The movie always keeps you wanting to know what is going on and what's happening with the characters and look at every characters point of view!,Stepmom

Susan Sarandon's performance was her usual top notch best and she, as probably only a mother could, gave a performance of astonishing honesty.  Ed Harris turned in another solid supporting performance and, even the toothy Julia Roberts lived up to at least some of her hype as the stepmom of the title.

It bored me so bad that I had a fight with my girlfriend about emotions.  There is only one reason to rewatch this movie.  I want to do a scientific study of how many times one of the characters cried, or almost cried.  Now don't get me wrong, like my girlfriend did, emotions are necessary for a movie to be good.  I can't stand movies, and it seems to be either the French, if subtitles can be emotional, or Hollywood that make these movies, that are obviously trying to suck me in by squirting tears in my eye.  The whole movie was a magnanimous fairy tale.  I would have called it, ""Trouble in Never-neverland.""  Everyone lived in a beautiful house, with beautiful things, with lots of money, being beautiful themselves, having cute kids, having cool jobs, and even the damned dog was cute.  Blah!!

120,donnayankee,Surprising!,7,29 April 2006,"When I saw the trailer for Stepmom at the movie theater, I wanted to see it because it was believable. The parents are divorced and the father is engaged to a woman young enough to be his daughter. Jackie is jealous because Isabel is not a younger version of her and she may feel Anna and Ben will get close with her. My parents were never divorced, but for those whose parents are and remarried may know exactly what it's like to be in Anna and Ben's shoes. Before I saw the film I had no idea Jackie was going to get cancer and die. The trailer was poorly advertised. When Anna became fond of Isabel, Jackie resented their friendship because she felt as though she were being replaced. The ending was good because there was peace in the family and Jackie grew fond of Isabel and knew her children were going to be fine. The only thing I didn't like about Stepmom was that a woman Susan Sarandon's age playing a mother to a 12 year old and a 7 year old. After seeing this movie, I saw that being a childless Stepmom can be a lot of pressure.",Stepmom
121,WorkingClassDog,"Strong performances, good script",9,20 December 1998,"A well written piece about the adjustment of two young children when a much younger woman becomes their stepmother.  Beautiful and well-written performances by Sarandon, Roberts and Harris make this an outstanding vehicle for all three. Jena Malone shines as a 12 year old girl going through the insecurity of her mom being replaced by a younger woman, and coping with growing up at the same time.  Liam Aiken is adorable as the young mischievous Ben, too young to quite understand it all, yet still creating his share of havoc for Roberts' character. Roberts and Sarandon make worthy adversaries, with the mom always tring to sway the kids' opinion, while the Stepmom just tries to learn how to be a parent, even though she never planned to be.Although I'm not usually big on family drama type movies, this one's a winner.

I enjoyed it and didn't feel embarrassed about the tears, but on analysis, there were a lot of problems with the plot. What was it that changed the main protagonists' attitudes toward each other? Why did Mom fess up to her secret when she did? Did Stepmom end up just being the surrogate babysitter, or did she continue her career?I think the acting, pacing and especially the music had a lot to do with the emotional impact of most scenes, especially in the second half of this film.

They are both wonderful actresses, but so different. They did a damn fine job.  I wouldn't change a thing about this movie.  It is a big statement about our lives.

The stepmother's role is the only one of the male roles to emerge faintly from one dimension, to resemble a live person.  The mom is a controlling, spiteful, know-it-all, who also somehow manages to muster immense, flawless tenderness with her kids.  The dad is just good.  The daughter resembles a person; the son, some narcissist's self-image of himself in childhood, remarkably charming and good-natured.  As I watched it, I figured, ""This was written by someone with a godawful, but dead, obsessive-compulsive mother to whom he was overly close in childhood, whom he feels bad about hating now, especially since he likes his stepmom so much."" The performances are excellent, but the characters are so incredible that this is more cartoon than drama.  Some parts were so predictable and mawkish I just fastforwarded through them.",Stepmom

131,pagaly,A touching and honest telling of mixed families,10,27 April 2008,"This movie honestly addresses the emotions and stories behind divorce, stepparents, and cancer. One of the strengths of this movie is that it does not vilify anyone. There is no evil stepparent, ex-wife, ex-husband, or stepchildren. You identify with every character, even when they act imperfectly. When the stepdaughter, Anna (Jena Malone) acts completely bratty towards stepmother Isabel (Julia Roberts), you do not only identify with Isabel at having to make the best of this situation. Your heart also goes out to Anna, a young child who is going through this tough time. It is Jena Malone's Anna that has the most touching lines. ""You do not walk out on your mother!"" Father goes. ""No, that is your job."" Simultaneously the insecurities of the normally perfect Jackie (Susan Saranadon) are understandable.The movie's only faults are that it sometimes overemphasizes points and it does not fully address its topic. By giving Jackie cancer it does not explore the complexities of a mixed family. Instead, it leaves you with the cop out. ""You have their future, I have their past.Nevertheless, I love this film. Another great thing about this film is the acting. Julia Roberts, Susan Saranadon, and Ed Harris are known commodities as is Chris Columbus.

132,mcfly-4,Incredulous and not entertained.,2,27 December 1998,"The first two thirds of the film are quite clearly stated by the sixty-second trailer. The big screen, unexpurgated, version serves only to make these loathsome and hateful people (well portrayed by Susan Sarandon and Jena Malone) more substantial and more tangible. The events of the last third of the film are intended, I assume, to turn around our perception of these characters and somehow make them more endearing. Well, for me, it just didn't work. Although the acting was at least competent, the apparent moral of the story of absolute forgiveness under adversity was just not plausible.If you are a staunch Julia Roberts fan you may appreciate her portrayal of the unquestioning Isabel but are not likely to enjoy the abuse her character must endure.",Stepmom

I expected more with a seemingly good cast, but thisfilm is definitely one of Julia Roberts' lows. The script isweak; almost all of the lines in the so-called ""touching"" scenesare over-used and cliché.

It's a touching tale of maternal love that doesn't fail to move you no matter how many times you see it. It's a gem !Stepmom tells you the story of an American marriage that loses its spark with time and the man seeks love outside of it. This sensitive film deals with how the family handles the delicate situation --- at times, holding out bravely ... and at other times, buckling under the emotional trauma ! The other woman, very ably portrayed by Julia Roberts, is a genuinely good human being who tries to bond with her lovers' kids inspite of their mother's (and their own) initial bitterness towards her. The plot thickens when the mother of the kids, portrayed with finesse by Susan Sarandon, is found to have cancer. The mother's days in the world are now numbered and the family must learn to carry on without her ... ! Stepmom now paints a warm and endearing picture of how the members of this family reconcile their differences and stand united and strong in the face of this crisis.It would be UNFAIR if I rated this one anything less than 9 ... !",Stepmom

As others have mentioned the main characters are selfish and self-absorbed but this made it real for me and I can imagine feeling the same as Susan Sarandon's character if the same thing happened to me.

137,bharani123,One of the best of Susan Sarondon,9,6 April 2008,"Susan Sarondon makes an indelible mark in this movie like she always does. Though the movie seemingly captured the emotional difficulties of Julia's rather than Susan's character, I felt it was the emotional toughness of Susan that binds this entire movie together. The movie's centerpiece is the relationship between the two women, but Ed Harris's character could have been given little more prominence; I felt he went through the turmoil more than the two women combined. Julia is strong yet vulnerable; she shows her resolve to win over the children's hearts more than once, and she does.But ultimately, it is Susan who scores over. Every time Anna and Ben (her children) look up to her, she sets an example of how a mother should be. In the opening scene, when she says ""I'll handle it from here"", it becomes clear that she is going to handle the film as well. When she discloses her illness to her children, Anna goes wild that Susan didn't tell her earlier, but Susan knows that she'll eventually accept it. Despite all her toughness, she shows she is one among us by accepting her fear that her children might forget her. Finally she knows that her children are ready to accept Isabel (Julia), so she accepts her as well.I won't accept Susan's character any other way.",Stepmom
138,amyash1966,Boring and Unrealistic,3,7 January 2010,"As a stepmom, I have quite a few things to say about this film. I think this is one of the worst films the great Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts have ever been in. This is basically about a man who is divorced with 2 kids who has a new, much younger girlfriend. I don't want to explain everything about the movie, just a few annoying points. First of all, the biological mother played by Sarandon lives in an incredibly beautiful and expensive home in Connecticut. She also has lots of land and horses. Sarandon apparently does not work either. The father played by Harris lives in the city in another incredibly beautiful and expensive place and they all drive expensive cars. How is this possible? With the bio-mom receiving the house, the child support and alimony payments it's a wonder he is not living in a 1 bedroom apartment. According to the way everybody is living, he must be a multi millionaire. Of course the new girlfriend, Roberts, is a trendy fashion photographer. Uygh. It seems everybody has lots of money. That is what irks me, because along with all the drama involved in being part of a blended family, one major problem is money. Ex- wives taking their ex-husbands back to court for more support, etc.. The struggles of the second family to make ends meet because 30% of the fathers income is going to his ex-wife. Apparently this is not an issue here. Another thing is the ex-husband, Harris, meets his ex- wife, Sarandon for dinner to discuss the fact that he will be asking his girlfriend, Roberts, to marry him. Come on. I can understand telling the bio-mom before you tell the kids, but telling her before you give your girlfriend the ring? It was like he was asking permission from his ex-wife to ask his girlfriend to marry him. It's so nice that ex-spouses can get along so well. Detect sarcasm. Oooh, if I found out my fiancé did that he'd be in a world of trouble. Another thing that irked me was that Roberts received a call on the job to pick up her future stepson at school. Apparently, the mom and dad could not do it and nobody else was available. I believe you have to be on a list at the school to be allowed to remove children for the safety of the kids. How did the fathers girlfriend get on that list? Please. So she risks her job to pick up a child that she is not responsible for. She goes back to her photo shoot in the park with the kid, but he wanders off. He eventually gets found, but when the bio mom finds out she is furious, and files a restraining order against Roberts. Huh? How about reprimanding the kid for wandering off when he was specifically told not to, and then not allowing Roberts to take responsibility for the kids ever again? If Roberts lives with the kids father, a restraining order seems quite ridiculous. I have to say, that this film shows a fantasy that most stepmoms have when dealing with unreasonable, jealous ex-wives. That fantasy is the bio mom dying. Yes, Sarandon has cancer and is going to die. How wonderful that would be for so many non custodial stepmoms, no more alimony, child support payments, a hefty life insurance policy payout, and no more controlling ex-wife poisioning the kids against their father and stepmom. But this is a fantasy, not reality. This film ends up not about being a stepmom and having a successful family, but tying up loose ends and preparing the kids for having a replacement mom when the bio mom dies.",Stepmom

I saw it about 4 or 5 times. It even still touched me every time I saw it. The famous song in the movie is Ain't no mountain high enough. It's also on the soundtrack if you want to buy it. The cast is very talented too. They really know how to act when it's time for a movie. Besides all of the beautiful and touching parts it's funny at some parts.

Julia Roberts was probably her best since Mystic Pizza.  Ed Harris was the weakest of the cast, most likely due to the fact that he had an exceptionally unrealistic role to portray... the great guy who dumps his wife, gets her to condone his new relationship, then gets all the women in his life loving and hugging one another.

Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts do a wonderful job in portraying the rivaling ex-wife and new girlfriend. Ed Harris does great in his role of father. The scene where he explains to his kids why he fell out of love with their mother, but will always love them is very touching. Liam Aiken as ""Ben"" provides alot of humour in the movie. I like the scene where he thinks he has put a spell on his step-mom. Too cute. I love the actors in this movie and one of the reasons why I have watched it several times.",Stepmom
153,TenaciousTexan,Not a comedy...,7,20 November 2010,"As a Comedy, it stunk. It had only a couple of funny moments that were shown in the trailers - no other funny parts...In actuality, it is a tear jerker. I don't know why they classify it as Comedy or why the trailers gave the impression of a Comedy. As a real stepmom, myself, I was hoping to see a lighter-side comedy about relationships that can be difficult and sometimes pretty tough and even heartbreaking; instead, it was about a relationship that was forced/forged through tragedy - not much to laugh about in the tragic second half of the movie.That being said, it was well written and well executed and as a Drama it was really good. The acting was superb and the writing was excellent. I was disappointed because I had been in the mood for a Comedy when I watched it.",Stepmom
154,shanelleeno,Favorite movie,7,9 November 2017,"A beautiful, yet somewhat heartbreaking story about a stepmother whom is struggling with the new world of being a mother while trying to keep up with her promising career. Not without difficulty.Whenever I watch this movie I get stuck, it totally gets me under its' spell and I find myself admiring the good acting, the casting that makes this movie what it is and the storyline. It's one of the best movies I have ever watched and I can assure you that tears will fall if you're into romantic, feel good-movies :')",Stepmom
155,sean_colclough,cute movie,9,17 July 2005,"this movie was so adorable.. the characters where all perfect and couldn't of been better i mean common the little boy was a sweetie the girl was pretty and the mums where awesome! who wouldn't want a mom like either one of them.. the dad was pretty nice too...the best part of this movie was when they family photo was taken at the end with both mums in the picture! And bringing back a classic song like ain't no Vally was so dope i loved it.. I noticed some one said that these ""feelings in this movie went to fast""..thats one of the dumbest things i have ever herd, feelings are feelings they come and go as they please ha ha.. I' am sure you could love some and hate them to death in two months, and then love them again. I would gladly watch this movie again since i have bought it!",Stepmom

157,TNT,Excellent female performances,10,27 December 1998,"Whether you're susceptible to crying at movies or not, you'll enjoy this picture.  The performances by Sarandon, Roberts, and Malone (Anna) were particularly good.  The three age groups interacting was done very well.  Susan Sarandon is an excellent actress and has been around for some time. Julia Roberts seems to be getting better with each new film. This time she was outstanding.  The dialog between the three women was especially well written; very real, not phony at all.  Each played a very strong role.  Ed Harris and the little boy were in supporting roles even though they were an important part of the story.  I'd recommend this film to all and will see it again.",Stepmom
158,MorrisDO,Good Movie! but sad :(,10,26 December 1998,"Someone in another comment said something about this being a science fiction...what?? how was it science fiction? i don't see how it could possibly be in the future.Anyway, i thought it was really good. a little long, but i liked it a lot. Parts were soooo sad, actually only one part, but i won't say why!! :)",Stepmom
159,dan-163,Very Dramatic but Good Acting,8,9 December 1998,"From the preview, you might think that this movie is lighthearted. At least that is what I thought. I was wrong, very wrong. The drama came as a big shock as I was expecting something completely different. Be ready for tears, especially if you're a mom (which I'm not, but I saw the people around me). The movie, however, was preety good. The acting was really good, as could be expected by the two actresses and Ed Harris. The story was engaging and did manage to give the viewer a good insight into both of the main characters' minds. The little boy in it was cute and managed to give out a few laughs but I couldn't help but think that they were trying to recreate the little kid from Jerry Maguire. So it's not Oscar material (except for maybe the acting, Roberts was particularly surprising) but it's a good Drama and worth the watch. However, don't go as I did, expecting a lighthearted movie or you will be disappointed.",Stepmom
160,AKGordon-2,"First half is good, second half is total cop-out!",5,14 January 1999,"This movie could have been so much better. If it were not for ""cancer"", a lot of marginal screen writers would be out of work. Killing off the mother instead of developing the dynamic relationship that would have had to evolve between the stepmom and the mom was just plain lazy writing!",Stepmom
161,ross-20,Uneven pacing and horrible writing bog down what could have been a good movie.,3,28 December 1998,"Stepmom is unable to overcome it's ""movie-of-the-week"" script.  The talented cast is weighed under by weak direction and a predictable script that is seldom funny or moving.",Stepmom
162,Jo-51,"Bring a box of tissues and watch the oscar-caliber performance by Sarandon, who should win best actress",10,27 December 1998,"The all-star cast of this movie makes it well worth a visit to the movie theater and the stock you'll have to buy in tissue companies.  Susan Sarandon's performance is breathtaking - she is perhaps one of the best actresses of our time. Eschewing vanity for performance, her acting is enhanced by her lack of external adornment.  She sparkles on her own, but with outstanding performances by Julia Roberts (perfect as the new stepmom) and Ed Harris (his face is so wonderfully expressive - ""What will we do without you?""), the entire movie is made even better.  The child actors in this film are fabulous.  In a word, this movie is fine, MIGHTY fine.",Stepmom
163,TomCees,I have seen 3000 movies in my lifetime. Stepmom was the first I ever walked out of in my life.,1,28 December 1998,"Stepmom after being hyped by its two stars for the past month was without any doubts the worst movie I have ever seen. It replaced that horror of horrors ""Body Guard"". The characters were unlikeable the plot was non-existent and the dialog could have been written by a high school freshman. Every one from stars,who by the way were executive producers (thus the reason for the hype), to the director should be held responsible for putting this piece of trash in theatres. The only redeeming factor from the entire miserable process was that Ed Harris only embarrassed himself three maybe four times. Two words say it all...""IT STUNK"" .",Stepmom
164,CarlaO,Good Drama,7,31 December 1998,"Good drama with good acting by Sarandon and Roberts and the children. Wasn't prepared for it to be as sad as it was.  As a mother myself, some of scenes were heart-wrenching to say the least! The only complaint I have is that the movie made a couple of stabs at working mothers that made me flinch a little.  In one scene Jackie pretty much states that working mothers are too selfish to be good mothers; that 'good' mothers would stay home with the kids.  Then, Isabel's boss accuses her of being unfocused, etc. indicating that a working mother can't focus on her work because she's worrying about her kids.  Both scenes sort of made me feel like working mothers can't be good mothers OR good workers.  Anyway, good drama, real tear-jerker, loved Jackie's house!",Stepmom
165,smile24,You'll leave with red eyes but satisfied.,9,31 December 1998,"I just went to see this yesterday with my friends and I loved it! It was so good! I love Julia Roberts and Susan Sarnadon and they were excellent. They really made it worth seeing. It's really touching and makes you think. I went home and gave my mom a big hug. The acting was wonderful and you have a good time too. It's not one of those movies where it's all heartbreak.  Even though you know what will happen once you leave, you leave satisfied and happy.  The little boy who ever he was was adorable too! And the greatest part, as my friends and I left the theater and went back into the mall, we spent the rest of the afternoon singing: Ain't no mountain high enough!",Stepmom
166,charlie-76,"a chick-flick,but a boyfriend or husband can come along",9,3 January 1999,"Stepmom is a real chick-flick, if I had been a guy, my comments on this movie would definitely have been different. It's true, towards the end you can predict almost every word, especially coming out of the mouth of Susan Sarandon. But being a real chick-flick lover I didn't really care.This movie had everything: comedy, romance, and drama, only the action was missing. Julia Roberts was a great stepmom, Susan Sarandon played a wonderful jealous and over-worried mom. But I have to say too, ... the kids, and in particular Liam Aiken (Ben), stole the show. The whole theatre was filled with ""oooooooohh's"" and ""aaaaaaaah's"" the moment the little boy came on the screen. I do not agree with the people who would rate Stepmom as 'awefull', though I wouldn't rate it excellent myself due to the predictions. Stepmom is just one of those movies you go and see on a Sunday afternoon, when there's nothing else to do.",Stepmom

168,judy-24,"generally good film, tear-jerky, Chick-flick",8,10 January 1999,"This is strictly a woman's film, lots of female interaction between Mom, fiance' and daughter.

I would recommend this to all my friends, but leave the guys out.",Stepmom

Certainly, you're going to laugh but the main idea is to really reach us deeply. For sensible hearts, prepare for the tears. A very nice movie, I strongly recommend it.",Stepmom
171,muamc6,"great acting, great movie",9,24 January 1999,"I was really surprised by this movie. I was expecting a comedy, but it was a real tearjerker. The acting was great, and they did a good job of portraying normal reactions for things like their dad getting remarried, as opposed to the ""perfect"" kids we often see on TV and in the movies. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were wonderful, as was Ed Harris. Jena Malone, who I haven't seen in anything else, did a great job.",Stepmom
172,denn,Regurgitated Pap,1,23 February 1999,"Awful film - predictable in the extreme, and an unashamed rip off of the thousands of other mindless tear-jerker films out there.  Yet again Julia Roberts managed to go through an entire film looking like she is just about to burst out crying.The absolute worst thing about this film is the drawn out ""tear jerker"" scenes.  The fact that Sarandon's character has got two kids means the mandatory awful farewell scene ""you will always carry me in your heart"" is actually repeated as the kids are wheeled in one at a time.Spend two hours cutting your toenails - it's more enjoyable.",Stepmom
173,Jax-25,"yes, i did cry",10,22 June 1999,"When i saw this film, i was expecting it to be not good but was i wrong, this film is a real ""tearjearker"", and for the sad scenes, i could not stop crying, and i am 19 and male Susan and Julia give wonderful performances, and Ben Aitken who plays the kid Ben, makes the movie shines brightlySusan who plays Jackie, plays her role perfectly as a woman dying of cancer, and how she deals with it, and finally excepting Isabelle as part of the family Julia as Isabelle plays it well,in trying to win over the kids affection. We witness her ups and downs, eg Kids don't like her, her job as a photographer,finding out that Jackie got cancer,and finally winning over the kids and JackieThe one that i didn't like about the film is Ed Harris character, he was there only 4 the tears, and his character wasn't developed much.This being my first review, i don't know what to talk about, but i assure u that this film is great.As i said before i did cry, when the sad scences were there.Julia Roberts career has lifted off since 'my best friends wedding' and since then she has not made a bad movie.Susan Sarandon is an actress who looks good in playing an emotional person, eg.Dead man Walking with Sean PennEd Harris is a actor, suited to action movies eg.the rock, not dramas eg.the truman show and stepmomThis is a feel good movie, a great storyline, some jokes and the emotion will take over!!!u be there 4 the tears (i was) be there 4 the joy be thre 4 each other (watch this film with the family, it shows u what family do when tragedy strucki give this film 8 out of 10",Stepmom
174,swansea-2,Not another cancer movie,4,19 March 2000,"I gave this movie a rating of 4 - 2 for Julia Roberts and 2 for Susan Sarandon as their performances were great as always.  Unfortunately the rest of the movie was terrible.  Why does Hollywood have to include cancer as a co-star in movies.  After going through 3 cancer-related deaths in my family, I can live without that much realism in movies.  Couldn't Mom and Stepmom have resolved their issues in another way - couldn't one of the kids have gotten lost and Julia and Susan worked together to find them?After this movie, I have made a point of finding out if a movie is a ""cancer movie"" before going and if there is even a hint of it, forget it.",Stepmom
175,pilnoir,You will laugh so hard you'll cry,4,6 September 1999,"When watching this film I often laughed, but it is not like you think.  This film was horrible.  It is hard to believe it took five screen writers to make this film.  The dialogue by itself was enough to make cringe.  And as for the plot, it seems that Hollywood as developed a death equals tears theory.  Writers, if they want audiences to cry, simply kill someone.  The same technique was used in Patch Adams, another stinker.  Frankly, I think it is crap.  Films should be subtle and not force its tears on viewers like an used car salesmen.  Maybe I am just cold at heart, but i just don't buy it.",Stepmom
176,gazelem,Outstanding all the way around,9,23 July 1999,"For a ""chick flick"" it's great.  My only complaints would be that it's a bit predictable, a bit long, and Sarandon is too much of a bitch such that her character becomes less believable.",Stepmom
177,Drewbacca,Not the greatest movie...but one of the most heartfelt.,6,17 November 2001,"I expected a very fun situational comedy; instead I got a very serious movie, with little to laugh about.

178,fanofreba,A Stepmom review from a fan!,10,13 April 2006,"I loved this movie! If you are in the mood for a tear jerker movie, this is the movie too see. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are remarkable together. This is the absolute best I have seen Julia Roberts act and this movie defiantly brings out her talent. Susan Sarandon can make any movie good. But she delivers outstanding effort to make her character relate to other women who have had the problems that Susan's character faces. This movie is of course a 10 out of 10! Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon will make you laugh now and then, but they will also make you cry with the difficulties that they face together on screen. Stepmom is a movie you'll enjoy and ""always always"" remember as a movie that filled your heart. So if you haven't seen Stepmom yet...go and see it! You'll be glad that you did.",Stepmom
179,nancytalkingbear,Do NOT watch this movie -- it is one of the WORST ever...,2,20 April 2006,"Susan Sarandon and Ed Harris are very good actors, but this movie is one of the sappiest pieces of $%&* I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. There were several times where I had to yell out loud in pain from the sheer corniness of it, and I was watching it by myself. It is pure torture, I HATED it SO MUCH...it almost defies description. The story line is very sad in that typical tear-jerker kind of way, and Julia Roberts (who in some scenes looks like she is wearing a wig made of hay) is no great prize of an actress, in my opinion. I only rented this, despite my better judgement, because I thought there might be some redeeming aspect to it. Would that this were the case. It is a COLOSSAL waste of time. The actress playing the daughter does a reasonably good job also, but that is about all this thing has going for it.",Stepmom

I have searched online and nothing has come up with it. I know the house is in Nyack, Ny. I know that the inside shots were made up on a stage. We really like the way the house looks outside. We love the movie and thought the whole cast did a wonderful acting job! We watched it last night on TV and just cried all over again. I remember when it first came out in theaters...I went to see it and cried!!! I love Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Susan is an all time favorite actress of mine. I love how the movie shows the seasons! Great Job!!",Stepmom

I called my children (they were in bed, and had to be up early in the morning for work). I just needed to tell them that I loved them. That movie has touched my heart like no other, and it was very easy to forget these were actor.s. I grew emotionally attached to every person in the film. I can honestly say that I have never been so emotionally involved in any movie like this one. It grabbed every emotion in my heart. When the credits scrolled, I just lay back on my couch, and thought about every piece in the scenes, and relived them in my mind. I know the movie is from 1998, and its not new, but, its brand new to me, and the only reason why I wouldn't see it again is because its so heart wrenching. Wonderful wonderful film. Thankyou for this movie.",Stepmom

183,MichelangeloAngel,A new women in a previously married man's life creates stress for both his children and his ex-wife.,8,15 March 2008,"This was a very enjoyable film to watch. This must be due to the fact that it's bright and filled with life through Liam Aiken's character Ben. It's also lighthearted through the new love emerging between Julia Robert's character, Isabel, and the two children, not to mention her relationship with Luke, played by Ed Harris.The movie is also done well through the visual appeal that it holds. The beginning of the story is in late summer and ends at Christmas. The entirety of the film's scenes all use various camera angles and shots. This helps the viewer to be involved in the story and get to know the characters.The topic of Stepmom was very difficult because of Susan Sarandon's character's fight with cancer. The most touching scenes were those of her and her children during Christmas. It was highly emotional when she talked to her daughter about how she would aways be there with her, if the daughter let her. The scene was so poignant because most daughters could clearly picture herself in Anna, the daughter's shoes, or even the mother's.All in all, this is a great movie which deals with two major issues. Even the film is from 1998, it's still just as prevalent ten years later.",Stepmom

Julia Roberts is my favourite actress and I have always wanted to see her and Susan Sarandon working together. Susan Sarandon's film Thelma and Louise reminds me of this film, two women facing dificulties and hardship to come out on top stronger and together.",Stepmom

The love they show for their mother is gold-worthy. It's also a realistic movie which makes it even better. Their mother doesn't like the stepmother at first because she still loves her ex-husband and she hopes to get back together but when she sees that their love is real she puts her hate aside and just tries to live through it all. The fact that the mother accepts the fact that another woman will take care of her children when she's no longer there had me in tears. It's a real tearjerker and a really good movie to watch with the whole family. It's a movie that will stay in your mind and heart forever. If you haven't watched it yet, this is your chance.

The most interesting thing I found from this movie was the unconventional and definitely unintended friendship between the mother and stepmum. The selfless love they have for their spouse and the kids was so heart warming. It's a movie that will pull heart strings, put a heart warming smile to your face and leave you feeling inspired to expand your heart and mind to love others more, especially those in our lives who are hard.",Stepmom

Why marry Luke Isabelle?? He has a young son but just ""falls"" out of love with his wife and leaves them?? I cry bullshit. Luke's answers are so maniacally 1 dimensional it frustrated me....and she is supposed to be some great photographer but is just willing to give up her career?

I don't often post comments on websites like this but it has to be said that the acting was superb and Jena Malone and Susan Suranden were sensational together! you would really think they were mother and daughter. The rest of the cast really brought it to life, you would also think that there was an actual history there, and it all made sense. Sometimes I felt that the characters were a bit snappy towards each other but that is what they call a great writer and an excellent cast! I was brought to tears with this movie and that rarely happens, I would see it a million times and still be touched. I am no professional critic but I know what I like and I liked this very much.
