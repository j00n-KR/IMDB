0,kosmasp,What life in the hood is really like (not),6,3 February 2021,"Or Hip Hop Hood as they are calling the movie in Germany. But as you maybe can tell by the long original title (which is being often shortened into ""Don't be a Menace"" when people talk about the film), this is a comedy. A spoof movie if you want to call it by its name.The long title also includes the major movies being spoiled, but apart from those you have a few others (like Dead Presidents, another Hughes brothers movie, directors of Menace 2 Society, to name but one). I remember that I thought this was quite funny. Rewatching this made it clear it is more on the silly side of spoof comedy. I don't even think you have to know or have seen the movies this is based on ... the jokes work. Don't expect this to be politically correct or anything of that kind ... the movie uses cliches and offends every which turn it can. All in the name of comedy. That may not be your taste or style, but that is what is being served here.Aside from what you think of the humor (even if you don't like it, that is what it's called), the prop and background details here are quite rich. From plant on a fridge to other smaller details and items that enrich the whole setting. There went a lot of work and know how into the making and of the movie - even if it doesn't always seem that way",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
1,lee_eisenberg,This movie shows that stereotypes can be funny.,7,19 September 2005,"Spoofing practically every ""growing up in the hood"" movie, ""Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood"" is a laugh a minute. Following the adventures of Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) in LA's black ghetto, it's one joke after another - the way that a Mel Brooks or Leslie Nielsen movie is. Probably the funniest scene is when they enter a convenience store. The owner, convinced that African-Americans would only enter his store to steal things, follows them around - while a rich white man comes in and proceeds to empty the place. Containing virtually every imaginable use of the N-word, ""DBAMTSCWDYJITH"" is pure hilarity. Those Wayans brothers have it down.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
2,Quinoa1984,Funny spoof,7,7 July 2000,"I liked this movie (not as much as the Wayans future project Scary Movie) because of it's funny jokes on past gangsta movies.  It all ranges from Boys 'N' the Hood, South Central, Menace 2 Society, Dead Presidents and some others.  Cool fun, mainly from the Wayans bros. (Marlon, Shawn, Damon and Kennan Ivory) who wrote and produced this project.  Not in the best spoof category, but it isn't a waste of time either (though I'd rather see the gangsta comedy Friday).

3,view_and_review,The First of the Younger Wayans Parodies,7,30 December 2020,"""Don't Be a Menace"" is a hilarious parody of the various 'hood movies that came out in the 90's. We had ""Boyz in the Hood,"" ""Menace II Society,"" ""Juice,"" ""South Central,"" and a few other smaller films. ""Don't Be a Menace"" pokes fun at them all while especially concentrating on ""Boyz in the Hood"" and ""Menace II Society.""",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
4,gridoon2021,"Intermittently funny, but too long",5,23 July 2017,"This spoof of early-1990s ""hood"" movies is like an R-rated ""Naked Gun"" - on crack. It's sometimes funny and clever (I liked the gag of father and son being the same age (!), or the raining autumn leaves), other times vulgar and witless. And it's too long (a full 90 minutes) for this kind of plot-less parody. The title may be the best joke of them all! ** out of 4.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
5,FeastMode,my notes,6,26 June 2019,I laughed a lot the second time i watched this. not so much the third time. i guess a lot of the comedy comes from the surprises. there's also a lot of stupid stuff. still somewhat enjoyable but probably won't watch this again (3 viewings),Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
6,pmtelefon,laughless,2,16 January 2020,"I remember a million years ago on WPIX tv in NYC film critic Jeffrey Lyons saying that studios sometimes like to hide bad movies behind long titles. I've never forgotten that. In the case of ""Don't be a Menace...Blah, Blah, Blah"" it's true. This movie was a brutal experience. The only participate who survives the carnage is the always likable Antonio Fargas. Fargas plays his scene in a way I've never seen him before and it's very good. I wish this movie had a lot more of his character. It might have it almost good. As it is now, ""Don't be a ..."" stinks.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
7,rbverhoef,Before 'Scary Movie',5,26 February 2004,"Before 'Scary Movie' the Wayans Brothers made this movie, 'Don't Be a Menace'. It is a spoof on movies like 'Boyz N the Hood' and 'Menace II Society', two great movies about the hoods in Los Angeles.'Don't Be a Menace' starts pretty nice, although stupid, with some very funny moments. It is the same kind of humor you see in 'Scary Movie', not the most intelligent kind. As long as it works that is fine, but after thirty minutes I wanted this movie to end. After this every single joke was the same. When a movie like this becomes boring it is not very good. Not that it is good with any other kind of movie, but here it seems actually pretty hard to make it boring.Although 'Scary Movie' doesn't belong to my favorite movies either at least I had fun while watching it. For the first thirty minutes it was the same with this movie. Watch those minutes and then turn to something else.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
8,PredragReviews,"""Hey grandma, you've got the juice now.""",8,11 June 2016,"This is a highly understated comedy film. It has to be one of the funniest comedies I have seen, taking a humorous view of life in the 'hood' it is a spoof of the dramas such as 'Boys in the hood' and you may find it to be similar to the 'Friday' series starring Ice Cube (but funnier!). The famously funny Wayans brothers star in this film as Ash Tray and Loc Dog, both trying to work their way out of the hood. But whilst doing this they come across many extraordinary characters, 'Toothpick' a hardened regular jail goer (who is confused about his sexuality), Grandma who rides in LoLo's, break-dances and fights with Ash Tray, and also a women with seven kids.Marlon Wayans really came into his own in this one. He really showed his true comedic and acting abilities in this and made sure that every moment in this movie had a laugh in every scene. This was the starting point and the staple of how bad they were going to make fun of other movies (Scary Movie and Scary Movie 2). Not much of a plot, but it's the comedy is there, and it's a must see for all comedy fans of whacky zaney parody movies. And even if you don't know what there parodying, it still holds up being funny! Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
9,winner55,timing is everything,9,15 April 2007,"I was watching an old ""Honeymooners"" rerun with a friend and we came to Jackie Gleason's Ralph's inevitable ""To the moon, Alice!"" expression of frustration with his wife, and suddenly I realized that it WAS inevitable, so why were we laughing, having heard it a dozen times before? My friend pointed out that Gleason's timing - the manner in which he held his slow-burn, the widening of his eyes, the sudden ""Bang! Zoom"" take off into the line - was what always made it funny. We weren't laughing at the line so much at the performance of it.""Don't Be A Menace"" is the most obvious collection of predictable gags and bits I have seen in a long time, but it is by far the funniest. The Wayans are rather stuck - the genres they parody here have very rigid conventions, so much so that there is usually only one or two gags one can use to mock them - e.g., when a young gangsta warns us that many young men in the 'hood don't live to see their 21st birthday, we all know what's coming next. So the Wayans handle it in a manner that delays the punchline while emphasizing its obviousness. Thus we laugh with them, appreciating the way they pull it off, and recognizing the gangsta genre limit that's getting parodied, rather than at the bit itself.Just about the whole movie operates on this level, and for this reason has become one of my favorite comedies. The Wayans capture every moment with a dead-on rhythm that blends the gags into a kind of music. Shawn plays the steady bass while Marlon does some wild riffing. Other characters and bits drop in and out like improvisation and sound effects. Keenan Wayans drops in every now and then like the voice on a scratch dub. The tempo could have been a little swifter, but the rhythm itself is excellent.Comedy like this is very tricky, and I personally didn't think the Wayans' efforts in the ""Scary Movie"" films were quite as successful - but here they move it right along.It's rude, it's crude, it's in-yor-face - and it's just a delight to watch.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
10,michaeltrivedi,Wasn't For Me,4,18 December 2019,"I have never been a fan of parodies. This movie tries to imitate Friday and other LA hood movies. It's really just annoying. Even the Smokey character is annoying. If he was watchable, this movie would have been a lot better.I would skip it4 stars",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
11,brchthethird,The Wayans' Brothers last truly good spoof -- hits more than it misses,7,14 February 2016,"It probably would have helped if I'd seen all (or at least some) of the movies that this parodies, but as it stands, DON'T BE A MENACE is consistently funny enough on its own. From the Wayans' Brothers, DON'T BE A MENACE parodies/spoofs just about every ""hood"" movie from the 90's, like BOYZ N THE HOOD, MENACE 2 SOCIETY, etc. Shawn Wayans stars as Ashtray, a 19-year-old who moves in with his younger (than him) father, and Marlon Wayans as Loc Dog, one of his friends. If there's one big weakness, it's that there's not really a plot to speak of, meaning that the film plays like a series of skits rather than a cohesive story. That being said, there were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments and funny running gags. The best ones, to me, were Keenen Ivory Wayans as the mailman who pops up from time to time and says ""Message!"" whenever the ""preachy"" moments come. Also, everyone (and I mean everyone) drinks only malt liquor. Generally, the humor that works the best has to do with pointing out stereotypes in these types of movies (and life in general), rather than the scatological stuff which was often a little too gross for me. Thankfully, it wasn't relied upon as much as it is now in movies of this ilk, but fart jokes and foul-mouthed grannies will only get you so far. For those types of jokes, they were funny the first few times, but became a little tiresome later. This is also an extremely quotable movie, with such memorable lines as, ""Break yo self, fool!"" So, while I haven't seen really any of the movies this parodied, I have seen other Wayans' Brothers movies and this compares favorably to those. I'd consider this the last genuinely good spoof from them, even if the story structure is all but nonexistent. It doesn't really live up to Mel Brooks (but honestly, what can?), but as a distillation of 90's urban movie clichés, DON'T BE A MENACE is on fairly solid ground.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
12,mattymatt4ever,"Juvenile entertainment that's quite funny, but those 12 and under will probably enjoy it more",7,13 September 2001,"I saw this movie when it first was released in theaters.  I was about 12 years old.  The theater was packed, and the audience had a ball.  One of those films where a funny scene would come up and EVERYONE in the theater would start cracking up.  Well, I guess as you get older this humor doesn't appeal as effectively.  Sure, I now know the outcome of the gags.  I've watched the film about 10 or 15 times.  But even if I were to first view it today (I am now 19 years old) I don't think I would've laughed as much as I did when I was in grammar school.  There's tons of crude humor, tons of profanity, tons of explicit sexual references and even some mock drug use.  Everything you would expect to come out the pen of a Wayans brother.  Don't get me wrong, they are talented guys and I enjoy watching their (Shawn and Marlon) show from time to time, but they're not exactly the African-American Woody Allens. However, I do have to give it up for their (sometimes witty) jabs at those ""Growin' Up in Da Hood"" dramas.  I didn't see many of the films--from which the spoofs are based on--before seeing ""Don't Be A Menace.""  After I saw ""Menace 2 Society"" I noticed that 50-percent of the gags were taken off that critically acclaimed urban youth drama.  There are also some jabs at ""Boyz N the Hood.""  There are some genuinely funny moments that I will always cherish:  Bernie Mac's cameo as the black cop who hates anything and anybody black, Suli McCullough as the wheelchair bound Crazy Legs doing his MC Hammer ""U Can't Touch This"" number, the ""Hurry Up and Buy!"" scene at the convenience store, Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) applying for a job at the DMV.  There are more very funny gags worth a barrel of laughs, but there are also moments where they simply push the crudeness envelope and deliver a lot more groans than laughs.  There's one scene where Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) and Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones) are having foreplay.  She pours Kool-Aid on his stomach and sucks it off, sprinkles hot government cheese on his chest and it concludes with him sucking hot sauce off her crusty toes.  All this stuff may be funny to a five-year-old.  Not me.  Marlon's character is obnoxious at times.  He's another comic actor who sometimes tries too hard to be funny and simply hams it up.  Helen Martin (""227"") steals the show as the pot-smoking grandmother.You can, maybe, consider this a hit-or-miss comedy.  But there are a good enough amount of hits to overshadow the misses.  If you're not in grammar school, you might find some of this stuff utterly juvenile and distasteful; but it's still worth watching.  It definitely has its memorable moments.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

14,SKG-2,"Not great, but still pretty funny",8,29 March 1999,"After their brother Keenen had such success spoofing blaxploitation films in 1988 with I'M GONNA GIT YOU SUCKA!, Wayans brothers Marlon and Shawn tackle urban dramas in this spoof.  Like SUCKA, this combines an AIRPLANE! type approach to humor with a knowing wink at African-American culture.  It runs out of steam near the end, and some of it isn't funny, but most of it is, and what matters most in this type of movie is how many jokes work vs. how many don't.  The ones that do (especially when Marlon meets an attractive woman from the hood who has seven kids, and when she says to them, ""Now what do we say to the nice man?"" they reply, ""Are you my daddy?"") are really funny, enough to recommend this.  Looking forward to Keenen's spoof of horror movies, which I think is called SCREAM IF YOU KNOW WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
15,Hallelujah289,"Excellent comic timing, funny and insightful parodies. A real gem!",10,11 December 2019,"How come I've never come across this movie before? What a gem! It's like the black version of Naked Gun. Shawn Wayans plays Ashtray, the oblivious straight man of the film, much like Leslie Nielsen in Naked Gun. Maybe it's just me, but that's really funny in itself. What can I say. I loved the humor of this film. Molly Shannon's earnest, clueless character in Superstar is also similar.Other comparisons can be to the Austin Powers series (many visual spoofs every minute) as well as to the Chappelle Show (smart hidden social commentary) and probably also to South Park in the random stuff that happens (grandma with the uzi, crack addict offering fellatio for money).I enjoyed the comic timing of the jokes as well as the continuity in them too (watch out for the crack addict in the drive by shooting). I thought the concepts of the jokes and their execution was great. It's hard to think of flaws.I didn't watch either of the movies this movie is said to spoof heavily (see previous reviews). Still I thought it was very funny and I didn't feel lost. But I bet, like with the Scary Movie series (which the Wayans brothers also star in together), the scenes will be much funnier after having watched the originals.

16,buzznzipp1995,The one before 'Scary' movies etc...Homie plays that!!,6,23 February 2007,"The movie title alone, takes two hours to say. And talk about breaking all the stereotypical rules, if they weren't breaking all the rules I don't know what they would be doing. ""Don't be a menace"" I'm not surprised that there wasn't a sequel to this although it was ghetto -cutting humor that ate just about every other 'Hood' movie around then. If their comedy was a shotgun then there would be comedy-spatter all over the screen. Kim Wayans and the whole happy bunch bring their 'creative juices' to this hoodster-Rama, a ton of vulgarity, but a mountain of wit and eccentric brains, The Wayans make this a colorful and tasty treat for every fan. From the entry at Tray's room to the seven kids looking for their daddy and finding a step dad with a small car, this was a rap-hop malt-liquor adventure that really packs a staggering punch!See this if you liked ""In Living Color"" or if you just want to get comfortably into ghetto styled laugher-riotousness.

Surprisingly, this movie features only five Wayans (including Keenan's cameos).The film is a lot more cohesive than I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, and as such, is not nearly as funny.  Antonio Fargas has a mostly-wasted role, especially considering the fun stuff that the seventies TV icons were given to do in I'm Gonna Get You Sucka.The movie is worth a watch for a lot of the inside jokes, but make sure you rent it instead of buying it.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
19,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A hilarious, gut busting spoof of ghetto films",7,30 July 2005,"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood is hilarious. The first time I saw this, I caught a few minutes of it on HBO. I had to do something, so I only got to see a few minutes, but in those few minutes I was laughing more times per second than I had ever laughed before. Through that one time when I only saw a few minutes, I knew I had to see this from the beginning.This is a spoof of films that take place in the ghetto. The films it spoofs include Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, Juice, South Central, Higher Learning, Poetic Justice, and other films. Part of the reason I laughed so hard is because I had seen most of those movies, and I knew them well enough. If you haven't seen any of those movies, you probably won't find this to be funny. If you want to see any of those movies in order to understand this, the main ones you will have to see are Boyz N the Hood and Menace II Society. I laughed so hard when I saw this. It seems as though every second something funny happens. The movie follows Ashtray, a young man who is sent to live with his father in order to learn better and have more of a chance to succeed in life(think of Boyz N the Hood). Strangely, his Father is younger than he is. Little things like that make this movie very funny. Some other funny characters are Ashtray's cousin Loc Dog, Loc Dog's trigger happy Grandmother, their crippled friend Crazy Legs, and a desperate drug addict with some of the funniest lines in the movie. Funny things happen with these characters, such as when we first see Loc Dog's Grandma, she is swearing just about every word. A couple of minutes later, she smokes a huge joint, which is also hilarious. The look on her face, and her mannerisms in that scene are priceless. Another funny scene with Grandma is when she and another elderly woman are having a break dance competition in church. The character Crazy Legs was formerly the best dancer in the hood, until he was paralyzed from the waste down in a drive by. He has these little stubby legs that are about half the size of normal legs. In one scene he has a dream that he is a dancer in the video for MC Hammer's ""Can't Touch This."" That scene is so funny, it had me laughing for quite a while. This movie is not for everyone. Anyone who is offended by racial stereotypes will probably not enjoy this movie, as there are a lot of racial stereotypes in many scenes. Another reason this isn't for everyone is because not everyone is into this type of humor, and not everyone has watched the movies that this is a spoof of. If you are into this type of humor, and you have seen the movies that this is based on, then I'm sure you'll love it. If you like movies like this, then it is a must see. If you aren't into this type of movie, then you will probably spend better time watching another movie.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
20,fibreoptic,Really funny but...,9,8 November 2004,You have to watch a few other movies first to really appreciate this. The main two movies you have to watch first is Menace II Society and Boyz N The Hood. 'Don't Be A Menace To South Central While Drinking Your Juice In The Hood' spoofs these two to the max but if you haven't seen these two movies most of this movie will be lost on you. It pretty much is good from beginning to end and i can't think of anything bad to say about it. I particularly like the scene with Officer Self Hatred. This movie isn't a total spoof of movies with a couple of original jokes here and there. The Wayans brothers are good in whatever movie they are in so go watch 'White Chicks' and the first two Scary Movie's. If you like this then i also recommend 'CB4' which is equally hilarious. 9/10,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

I feel as though comedy is a way of looking at things in a lighter fashion.  If you think about it, anything can be funny and I think that one of the elements that makes the Wayans family so funny is their ability to make light of things that wouldn't normally be funny.  I have the same personality like that so I guess it is easier for me, I don't know.  Enough of that.  If you've seen all the movies that this movie spoofs then it should be even more hilarious.

As for anyone thniking of buying/renting this movie i would say only watch it if you have sense of humor and haven't been locked away in prision or somewhere for the last few years or else u won't get many of the jokes as it's storyline is basically to spoof all movies, but still a must see!",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
34,MikeFab1,"Waynes Brothers are funny, but disappointing",4,11 September 2002,"Waynes Brothers are usually very HILARIOUS!! I loved In Living Colorgrowing up. It was sad to see it cancelled after just 4 1/2 years. Butnow the Waynes Brothers could branch out and make movies.
This movie had SO much potential, but fell short. Let me explain. In theearly 90's Gangsta Rap was on the rise and becoming more and morepopular. With Gangsta rap came movies about growing up in the hoodstarring some of those rappers. Movies like BoyZ In Da Hood, Juice,Higher Learning, Menace II Society and other graced the silver screanprompting gang violence all over the country. It was time to paradythese films.The problem with this movie was NOT the fact that it wasn't funny. Ithad it's moments like Marlen's hair throughout the film (Flava Flav'syounger brother look); the guy shooting people in the Korean Storetrying to frame black people; chick with all those kids. The problem wasthat it was clear the film would appeal to younger audiences. Althoughit had a NC17 feel to it at times. Like that party in the back yardscene where a guy and girl are naked and getting it on. The moment I sawthat I knew that little kids (the target audience) wouldn't be allowedto see this movie in theaters. Thus making it a bomb at the box office.
This movie should have known better. It wasn't meant for gang members tosee and laugh at there mishaps, but for those teenage and preteengangsta-wannabees that live",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
35,onandonandon92,One of the funniest movies of all time... you will never see another one like this...,10,9 July 2009,"Don't be a Menace is one of the funniest films of all times. It takes a serious genre of film and picks apart every detail of it. This film shows no mercy. It is only out for entertainment. The most pivotal, gritty, and shocking scenes from hood movies, the ones that defined the genre and changed the way Americans thought about cinema and society, are spoofed mercilessly from the preachy Ice-Cube monologue at the end of Boyz in the Hood to the Asian convenience store in the beginning of Menace II Society...This movie has gotten shockingly bad reviews but I imagine these people have never seen hood films. Either that or they are the type that want to take everything too seriously. This is not a movie to think about and analyze or drag politics into... it is a film to enjoyFrom the opening comment spoofing the Boyz intro (""one out of every ten black males will be forced to sit through at least one growing up in the hood movie in their lifetimes"") to the ending scene, you will be in pain from the laughter this film will ensue if you have grown up watching hood films.This movie is one giant stereotype which people might pick at, but that is ultimately the point. While films like Menace II Society and Boyz have become classics of the 90s, they have also played on age old stereotypes and that is the heart of this film.Pickles, anyone?",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

The acting is bad, the script is worse. And why those guys had baby pacfiers in their hair I will never know. And you can tell this didn't have much of a budget to work with and it openly hurts the film. They had a good idea going in some parts but it never really came to past.

Unfortunately, fans of earlier Wayans efforts, like the ""In Living Color"" series, or ""I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka!"" will find this film a little flat, and the humour can get old, fast.  But on a whole, the movie is very funny, and if you follow the genre, you'll definitely recognize a few dozen (or hundred, or thousand) jokes strewn throughout the dialogue.

40,tulhamano,Surreal? no...this is real life!,9,16 April 2011,"Great movie, I saw it when i was around 14 it played on Portuguese TV, I didn't knew its name but i kept searching all this years, finally i got it and watched it again, same fun. People told me get ""friday"" get ""half baked"" and was never it...this is it!! You don't need to watch any other ""hood"" movie to understand or like this movie, you probably just need to know a little bit about the hood or about the street life or what you may like to call it. Im not American, Im not black, and I liked the movie and understood the humor on it completely, also helped that I listen to some American rap and I can more fully understand some references related to racial issues.About the movie itself it has no plot so its impossible for anyone to come here and write a spoiler. It's a succession of events, and the plot is just an excuse to keep it going. I find it a very smart, lively and audacious caricature/satire of hood life, all the stereotypes exaggerated and pointed out in a very straight fashion, straight and real enough to hurt many ""sensitive"" feelings, not every scene in the movie is hilarious some are not so funny, but it is made in such a relaxed and flowing atmosphere that everything is fine is all good.Music is excellent and it has many quality details from the production creating the right atmosphere. Well I loved this movie and I wish they would make more of this kind, at the same time it is a surreal or a nonsense comedy it has very deep meaning on it and it can look so real, because reality is so much like this, day to day life is not full of drama, its more full of comedy, and full of crazy and superficial characters somehow similar to the ones on this movie. Also reference to many talented actors here that became famous, almost every face is familiar.Comparing this with ""Friday"" or ""Scary movie"" for me is more hilarious than the movie itself. Just watch it, its a whole different level. Sorry if I got carried away with the review, this one deserves a big text and a 9.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

42,philomot,Uncle Tom turns nasty!,1,17 June 1999,"Now I know that a lot of black humor pokes fun at typical black things like for example gold teeth. But that doesn't mean that they always are funny. Don't be a menace is an example of this. The urban movie certainly lends itself for satire. The problem is that Wayans and consorts not only try satirize the typical 'ghetto' culture, they also belittle valid statements that are made in urban movies such as Boyz 'n' the Hood or Menace II Society. Personally I think that the makers of this movie should get their heads away from the bowel movements of their white masters. Besides this, the movie in itself is terrible. It's absolutely not funny. The jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the urban movie genre, the moviemakers show their views of the 'ignorant' urban (ghetto) blacks. Now there are some other jokes in this movie, but I believe this to be the main fare.In conclusion this movie is crap and the makers should use their talents to make a constructive comedy/satire movie. They have examples in Men With Black Hats (which was made before this movie) and Friday.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
43,nerklus,Avoid,2,15 September 2006,"""Menace"" is not funny. It tries hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no acting, just mugging. One of the main characters wears a stupid grimace on his face the entire movie. No doubt as the less talented Wayans brothers starred, wrote and produced the film they were entirely blind to their lack of talent.Menace consists of a series of unfunny, one joke skits. The punchline can be seen a mile off, but you have to wait until it all unfolds. No zippy one-liners or snappy dialogue here. Just one scene after another building up to the joke. The jokes themselves are juvenile. Loc Dog (the one with the perma-grimace) talks to a beautiful woman - but then she has ... bad breath and then she picks her nose and then, wait for it (remember you must always w-a-i-t) she farts! How funny is that? Ten-year old boys may find it funny as they won't have heard the jokes as many times before. Alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow along and may even find it amusing. The challenge will be getting drunk enough to reduce your mental state to the level of the movie without passing out.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

Their's that sign at the beginning to start. well that was OK but then they start having some guy talking about the hood and then he dies then theirs the other guys who talks then he dies after the other guy says people don;t get to their birthday with out dieing. and he gets a cake now. then he dies. The jokes are just stupid they are;t that smart and i would have thought they would have been better from some one like the directors of scary movie:Shawn Wayans (written by) & Marlon Wayans (written by) & Phil Beauman (written by)but it sucked and i hop next time they want to make another comedy they make some good jokes not lame ones.,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood

49,all_my_life_ive_prayed,Excellent comedy - one of my favorites.,10,18 May 2005,"Don't Be A Menace is a good ""stupid comedy"" the only reason it's funny is because almost everything the characters do is hilarious and pretty stupid. The catch of the movie is it's a Waynes Brother's Comedy - meaning it's generally going to be hilarious and funny.Although ""Don't Be A Menace"" is parodied from many other movies, that I have never even heard of, I still got the whole idea. If you've seen it many times you'll get it after awhile, although you've got to really pay attention to the movie to get it.One of the best scenes is when Bernie Mac, Officer Self Hatred, arrests Ashtray (Shawn) and Loc Dog (Marlon) for being black, even though Bernie Mac, like Marlon and Shawn, is black himself.Another scene you don't want to miss is definitely is in the beginning of the movie when Ashtray's mom drops him off at his dad's house, who happens to be younger than Ashtray, Ashtray opens the car door only to cause a bike rider to hit it and flip his bike over it.I would definitely encourage anyone to buy/rent this movie because it's a ""classic"" Waynes Brother's Movie.

For example, listen when Ash-Tray.... yes Ash-Tray and Loc-Dog walk into the Chinese corner shop, listen carefully, it may be racist and crude, but still since the racism jokes are made by black people about themselves, it really doesn't insult the race much.

""Boyz in the Hood"" and ""Menace II Society"" are among the films at which the Wayans brothers poke fun.

79,jonirvine,My humble opinion.,10,2 April 2002,"Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood is without a doubt one of the funniest films ever made.I have just graduated from University and how I ever managed to pass whilst watching this film as often as I did, I don't know.A classic!Wayne & Waynes more recent films don't even compare.If you've not seen it yet, do so.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
80,still_i_rize7,I loved It!!!!!!!,10,19 May 2002,I love this movie.  I saw it when it first came out in '96 and I loved every minute.  I finally understand how Ashtray's father can be younger than him. The only possible way for that to happen is if Ashtray's father was born on a leap year.  I don't know if that's what Shawn and Marlon Wayans were thinking but it works that way.  I loved this movie and I recommend it.  I also recommend Friday and Next Friday.  And Friday After Next (Friday 3) comes out Nov. 22Peace Out,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
81,spwalrond,HOW FUNNY???,10,3 July 2002,Funniest Film i've seen for ages Lot better than Scary Movie If u like L.A style films & Scary Movies humor U WILL LOVE IT!!!!PLEASE BRING IT OUT ON DVD IN THE UK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
82,rogerdowe2000,No need to know the spoofees,10,1 April 2009,I actually never seen most of the movies that they were spoofing about but still thought it was one of the funniest and I mean funniest movies of all time this movie is filled with hidden puns that should tickle your funny bone. To give this movie an overall 6.5 is a disgrace both to the wayans bro's and comedy lovers all around the world at least an 8 8.5 minimum I really don't think anyone can name me a movie that is even remotely as funny or as good as this one. If you love quirky comedy than this movie is definitely for you I recommend it and so does my brother after watching menace 2 society ( which is the movie this movie is based upon) I really did have a true understanding of it but didn't really matter cause it was funny either way,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
83,Alle,The Best Of Wayans!,10,30 January 2005,"This movie was by far the best movie by the Wayan's Bros. I had only seen Boyz N the Hood by the time I saw this movie, nonetheless I found the movie hilarious!! You really don't have to have seen any of the movies they spoofed to get the jokes.What's so good about this movie is that there really isn't ONE scene where you won't laugh, unfortunately sometimes you laugh so much you actually miss some of the jokes that come after....The acting was great, especially from Shawn's part(Ashtray), his facial expressions were just great, and Marlon (Loc Dog) also nailed his part as the stoned (and mentally ill?) cousin.If you haven't seen it, go rent it or buy it whenever you have the chance as this is one of the funniest movies out there!! 10/10",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
84,ghostfacekiller75,one of the best!!!!!!,10,14 March 2003,well ill start off by saying this is one of the best movies ive ever seen!...the story is great (theres not really much of a story) and the whole thing kept me laugh the entire time i watch it.  plus the movie has some great catch phases you can use to make others laugh. .......................all in all...99/10,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
85,BEATtakeshi,I got these cheeseburgers man........,8,17 February 2003,"This film is funny, just sit back, get backed and let the jokes cover you like a warm blanket.  It feels good you know hmmmmmmmmmm....Well seriously, this film for some reason other than being a spoof and having the same actors as Scary Movie, gets compared to the aforementioned film.  Although in comparison Don't be amenace is a far superior film.  Just remember: cross at the green, never in between",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
86,lrbast,A funny theme,8,5 April 2010,This is a movie that hits on many truths. Its a funny movie that represents the ghetto. in the white eyes its a exaggerated truth of the hood. in the ghetto eyes its a joke of the code of the streets. The movie will bring up allot of controversy and plays fun of and spoofs of the real world. Almost every part of this movie will bring up personal or beliefs of what you see the perfect hood. Its worth seeing and paying attention to every word and scene in this movie over and over again. Even behind the main parts of the movie can be funny to you. The Waynes brothers are the most genius in this movie then every thing that they have done. I have never seen any movie that is so on and so wrong.,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
87,jeoma,Absolutely Fantastic,10,26 September 2003,Gimme a S Gimme a ... bla bla blaWhat does that spell?SUPER!!!!this is really an awesome movie gotta see it and vote 10!!!,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
88,jobosquiff,hysterical,10,9 December 2003,"you cant take it seriously really, its too damn funny, aswell as the fact i have not yet watched the film whilst being serious. the wayans' (family) are brilliant, abused as far as scary movie(s) go but still very funny men. the film itself parodies a lot of serious afro-american movies, and parodies it well. it should get better reviews for being one of the earliest and best wayans productions.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
89,Mad_Crumble,Awesome,10,16 November 2005,"Well after weeks and months of my friends recommendations about Don't Be a Menace i finally bit the bullet and watched it and to be honest i thought that this film is a piece of excellence. The thing that makes it a lot funnier is that no matter what age, gender, race you are there is something in this film that is mocking you but it is done in such a way that you can't help laughing and realising how true it is. Anyone who does not have a strong sense of humour or anyone who can't take a joke made at there gender or race then do not watch this, it is an obvious micky take film so this is your warning. Anyway i hope that this review has helped you decide whether you want to watch it or not(most people have already seen it)",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
90,worldisborn,Funniest Movie Ever,10,26 February 2005,"every single scene in this movie is absolutely hilarious; there will not be a minute where you don't laugh out loud; this is absolutely hilarious and is the greatest movie ever. It makes fun of several movies: menace to society, south central, juice, and boyz in the hood; hence the title don't be a menace to south central while you drink your juice in the hood. Anyway i love this movie and is in my top seven comedy movies ever list.1. don't be a menace 2. dumb and dumber 3. something about Mary 4. blind date 5. meet the parents 6. meet the fockers 7. Harold and kumar go to white castle",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
91,kapetanovicluka,Throwing UP,1,19 December 2015,"I watched this film and now i am living with permanent brain damage.My legs don't work, i cant talk and i am blind right now.Thank you producer for destroying my hopes and dreams.I don't want to watch any more films after this , because may be more films like this one.If you have enemies, let them watch this, they will suffer.I imagine hell like this.I will need huge amount of alcohol to kill memories on this film.Please kill it with a fire.To dear Paris Barclay: You have sick mind.How anyone can let you make this. This film is like Hitler of all films.It should be a weapon against normal people.You can't even name this crap.Please tie your hand and legs and jump into the river, but drink poison first to be sure you'll die.And while falling activate bomb by detonator and blow your sick mind.I feel sorry for being born.Goodbye world.",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
92,hellybaybee,FFS,1,25 August 2018,"As with all the wayans' ""Comedies"", this is dirge of the lowest order. It's lije someone gave a collection of films of one genre to a couple of 12 year olds and said ""now write a comedy about this,"" god awful, 6.6 stars was incredibly generous imo. I would also like to point out that I've seen boys n the hood, menace II society and juice - that doesn't stop this film being awful",Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood
