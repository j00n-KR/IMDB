0,TheLittleSongbird,Doesn't entirely sink but doesn't completely float either,6,3 September 2012,"Ghost Ship is not a terrible movie, far from it. It opens very strongly with a brutal and scary opening sequence. It does look good, with a good and atmospheric vessel setting and the effects are much better than the cheap and over-used ones I was actually expecting. The ghost is sexy yet quite frightening as well, there are definitely some nice jumpy and suspenseful moments. As well as some good photography, decent direction and a spooky but not obvious music score. The acting overall is better than average, Julianna Margoyles has the most interesting character and she is very good here. The support cast support her solidly, especially Karl Urban, Issiah Washington and Alex Dimitriades. Ron Eldard is also good though he does have some of Ghost Ship's worst lines, while Desmond Harrington has a brooding presence if occasionally a too obvious.Gabriel Byrne is somewhat of a disappointment though, he seems to be aware that his character isn't in a lot of the movie and he doesn't seem to be making of an effort as a result. The script does have poor moments, coming across as stilted and clichéd, while apart from Margoyles the characters are never realised fully. The story gave me a mixed reaction, it does have a great tense atmosphere and some nice creepy moments, plus it does deserve plaudits for not being completely predictable, but it is sluggishly paced a little too often and while creepy apart from the opening sequence there is never anything particularly scary. The last 30 minutes are underwhelmingly silly and the only scene really that I'd consider predictable.Ghost Ship does have its faults, but overall it is a decent movie with a good atmosphere, decent acting and a great opening sequence. I just wish the pace, script and ending were better and that I learnt more about the characters. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Ghost Ship
1,Leofwine_draca,Extremely derivative; the set design is the only good thing about this,4,21 July 2016,"Good old Dark Castle. This is the production group that brought us the remaked likes of the below-par HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL (the sum of the parts being far greater than the whole of the movie) and the above-par THIR13EN GHOSTS (a film that actually managed to be consistently scary). Their third film, GHOST SHIP, is not necessarily a remake of one such film, but it's not the first film with that title. Instead inspiration seems to come from the 1999 sci-fi horror film VIRUS and the 1980 B-movie DEATH SHIP, with George Kennedy. Sadly, GHOST SHIP is a clichéd and predictable ""cast run around corridors getting killed"" type-thriller with almost exactly the same set-up as the previous two films Dark Castle has produced, but with even fewer genuine scares or surprises.The film plays out various uninteresting incidents with monotonous regularity. The opening sequence is the best in the film. We are introduced to a bunch of upper-class twits dancing on board a cruise liner sometime in the 1960s. There's a foxy lounge singer on the soundtrack and some romantic lettering spelling out the titles. Think you've got the wrong film? Think again. The passengers find themselves massacred by a wire, which flies across the ballroom and cuts them into little pieces in a scene which reminds one of the Canadian indie hit, CUBE. The effect is simple, unbelievable, but astonishingly gruesome, and a real jolt to the system. A shame then that things go downhill so quickly.GHOST SHIP is a film with a lot of spooky appeal. It's atmospheric and the creaking, mouldy corridors of the long dead ship make for a great setting, I'll give you that. Thumbs up to the set artists and production designers. Unfortunately, the matter-of-fact plot plays out exactly as you would imagine: the salvage ship ""mysteriously"" blows up, trapping the characters on board; body parts are found floating in the water and then mysterious, miscellaneous 'haunting' type things start happening. Blood runs out of walls, history replays itself, a naked ghost leads a womaniser to his death at the bottom of a lift shaft (?). Techno music has a habit of playing at inopportune moments and there's an effectively spooky little ghost girl hanging around like the twins in THE SHINING, except this time she's ""good"" and played with skill by newcomer Emily Browning.By the time the end of the film comes, things aren't even scary anymore. When one character is revealed as a monstrous demon, they couldn't even be bothered to have any makeup. The whodunit aspect of the plot is lamentable and the finale, although boasting an impressive explosion, is empty-headed and severely disappointing. The less said about the ridiculous shock ending the better. Watch out for the dozens of plot holes and inconsistencies that the movie offers. I never knew you could carry a bar of gold around in your back pocket; I didn't realise trouser belts were that strong.The cast is a mixed bunch but generally uninteresting, thanks to the unlikeable characters. Gabriel Byrne is here, but who knows the reason why. Although he easily lends gravitas to the proceedings he seems understandably bored and unstrained by the material. Julianna Margulies's feisty female heroine is a predictable Lara Croft-style adventurer and utterly banal, while the the comic relief from the likes of Ron Eldard and Karl Urban is a bore. Elsewhere we see actors from NEIGHBOURS (!) hamming it up as gory zombie ghosts and a token black being led to his death in a stereotypically racist moment. GHOST SHIP, aside from the copious amounts of atmosphere, is an extremely boring and unnecessary film that adds nothing new to its genre. Dark Castle need to pull their finger out and make a film with some actual plot to it next-time, instead of creating a movie which rips off a dozen others in the process.",Ghost Ship
2,SnoopyStyle,Ghosts not scary,5,16 October 2013,"A team of salvagers finds a long lost passenger ship in the Bering Sea in international waters. According to maritime law, the ship is all theirs and they attempt to tow it back to port. The ship is mysteriously abandoned for unknown reason, and seems haunted by a little girl (Emily Browning).It takes the concept of a haunted house and put it to sea. There's nothing that great about it. Once they lose their tug boat, the story deteriorates. The ghosts just aren't that scary. They're better off with less of them.The story has a lot of good actors; Gabriel Byrne, Julianna Margulies, Ron Eldard, Desmond Harrington, Isaiah Washington, and Karl Urban. None of them look like they spent a day on a ship. It is interesting to see Emily Browning as a kid. But nothing is that scary in this movie.",Ghost Ship
3,Prismark10,Ghosts and gold,5,26 September 2016,"Ghost Ship starts out with a lot of gore and blood as in 1962 an ocean liner, the Antonio Graza, whose passengers die in what appears to be a freak accident that caused a tension wire to snap and the metal wire just carved the passengers and split them in two.In the present day Gabriel Byrne plays the captain of a salvage crew which includes Julianna Margulies. A plane pilot cuts them on the deal of salvage on the Antonio Graza that has been spotted and they decide to go for it as the rewards will be ample as the ship contains come gold shipments. The trouble is the ship is also haunted by some supernatural force and the ghost of a little girl reveals what exactly happened to the passengers and crew of the ship.The film opens interestingly and bloodily and the reveal by the little girl is also well executed. As a slasher ghost film it is better than you expect but like a lot of films where you are left in a haunted house scenario it becomes a little mundane as you know the crew will be killed off one by one as souls are salvaged.Like an episode of The Twilight Zone the film closes in a twist of a time loop. The film has some inspired set pieces but the actors do little to make it come alive.",Ghost Ship
4,claudio_carvalho,The Soul Collector,8,11 November 2003,"The savage team of a tug is ready to rest after the transportation of a platform. When they are celebrating in a bar, the plane pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) offers them the chance of rescuing a passenger vessel vanished in the oceans in 1962. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies) and the rest of the crew, tempted by the possibility of a great reward, decides to risk one more rescue operation before going home. Their greed leads them, of course, to a ghost ship, where they are spooked and threatened by ghosts. One of them, a little girl, shows Epps what happened to the passengers and crew during the voyage in 1962. A horrible unraveled secret will haunt the rest of the crew. Ghost stories usually take place in a haunted house. This one is in a passenger ship. This movie is not in the same level of 'The Others', 'The Shining' or 'The Sixth Sense', but is also good film. The screenplay play has some clichés and is predictable, but the cast, direction and special effects work well. Probably, the fans of romances will not like it, but those who like a ghost story will appreciate this film. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Navio Fantasma"" (""Ghost Ship"")Note: On 02 June 2017, I saw this film again.",Ghost Ship
5,Sleepin_Dragon,Never dance on a ship!!,9,17 September 2016,"Ghost Ship will forever be one of my favourite films in the horror genre, it has so much going for it, for starters the ship itself makes for a far more interesting setting then the usual and obligatory haunted house. The special effects, even to this day look really good, as do the sets, it has a quality look about it. Solid acting throughout, an unusual choice for Gabriel Byrne. It has some fine scares, coupled with some powerful imagery, not least the scene where Katie shows Ebbs the true events. I love the story line, it has a bit more depth then the usual batch of horrors, but the main bit where it scores highly is atmosphere, bucket loads of it, so its a little reminiscent of Event Horizon, that doesn't detract from what is a very good film.",Ghost Ship
6,lee_eisenberg,sinking feeling,4,20 February 2012,"A year after he directed the ""Thirteen Ghosts"" remake, Steve Beck directed ""Ghost Ship"", about...well, the title says it all. Most of the movie is totally predictable, although Francesca (Francesca Rettondini) is one ghost whom I wouldn't mind meeting. Even so, there's absolutely nothing special about the movie. The best Alaska-set movies of recent years are John Sayles's ""Limbo"" and Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"". The Andrea Doria* didn't need tribute paid to it like this. Probably just a way for Gabriel Byrne, Julianna Margulies, Ron Eldard and Desmond Harrington to make a quick buck, knowing full well what kind of a movie they were starring in. Pretty bad.Yeah, Francesca WAS one hot ghost!*More recently, of course, there was the Costa Concordia.",Ghost Ship
7,jboothmillard,Ghost Ship,1,15 March 2005,"This is one of the most boring and non-scary horror films I have ever seen. Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) has a team of history experts, or something. As they are travelling out to sea they come across an old wreckage of a ship. When they get on it all sorts of strange and creepy things happen. Munder (The Lord of the Rings' Karl Urban) even manages to eat maggots disguised and tasting like good food. None of the creepy stuff that happens rescues the film's poorness. The only bits that stick out in my mind of the film are the red dressed ""ghost"" woman getting her clothes off, and the beginning sequence where a wire slices through all the members of the ship. Apart from those moments, the entire film is absolute trash. Poor!",Ghost Ship
8,Woodyanders,Nice variant on the haunted house premise,8,31 January 2018,"The ragtag crew of a salvage boat run across an old abandoned ocean liner that turns out to be haunted by the unrestful spirits of people who were all murdered on it back in 1962. Director Steve Beck relates the enjoyable and involving story at a steady pace, adroitly crafts a pleasing spooky atmosphere, and stages the shock scenes with flair and skill (the boffo grab-you-by-the-throat gruesome opening multiple murder set piece packs a wicked punch!). The inspired script by Mark Hanlon and John Pogue offers a few neat twists as well as a valid reason for why the salvage crew can't simply just leave the ship once they realize something is seriously amiss. The sound acting by the tip-top cast helps a lot: Gabriel Byrne as crusty captain Murphy, Juliana Margulies as the gutsy and resourceful Epps, Ron Eldard as the rugged Dodge, Desmond Harrington as antsy greenhorn Ferriman, Isaiah Washington as the easygoing Greer, Alex Dimitriades as smartaleck Santos, Karl Urban as the scruffy Munder, and Emily Browning as helpful ghost girl Katie Howard. The luscious Francesca Rettondini slinks it up nicely as sultry singer Francesca. Kudos are also in order for the excellent art direction, Gale Tattersall's glossy cinematography, and John Frizzell's shivery score. An on the money fright film.",Ghost Ship
9,rmax304823,Welcome to the SS Overlook Hotel.,4,29 August 2005,"Movies about deserted houses or communities are somehow enjoyable partly because of the milieu. As a kid I strolled around the deserted Fort Hancock on Sandy Hook, New Jersey, established before the Revolutionary War, a thriving city in itself during two World Wars, and then closed to the public except for a handful of Coast Guardsmen. All the buildings were intact if not well kept. There were stacks of 20 mm. shells around. The base hospital still had drawers full of stained tissue on microscope slides. And not a soul to be seen. It was like the pilot episode of The Twilight Zone, enough to make one's hair stand on end.That creepy feeling of derealization is what gives this movie its impact. And that's about it.The half dozen members of a salvage tug run across a huge Italian passenger liner that disappeared 40 years ago, they board it and explore it. Weird, man. Cobwebs on things, all the brightwork with a green patina, cloth rotting away. And it's all dark and slick feeling.Nothing else about the movie is memorable except the exploration of that ship. The story is senseless. Ghosts come and go. An empty swimming pool decides to fill up with blood when nobody is around. Doors swing shut and lock. Beans turn into worms. Liquor bottles glide by themselves across the table. Every shock accompanied by a sting on the sound track. No point to any of it.Do you remember the scene in Kubrick's ""The Shining"" when Danny comes running to Jack Nicholson saying someone is in one of the hotel's rooms? And Nicholson slowly enters the room? And there is someone in the bathtub? And it's a beautiful young woman? And she gets out of the tub and slinks towards Nicholson who stares at her greedily? And while they are smooching she turns into an aged corpse? And Nicholson runs away in horror? And when he gets back to his family and they ask him what happened and he says, ""It was nothing""? That was probably the dumbest scene in ""The Shining."" ""The Ghost Ship"" is ALL like that scene.Except for the sets, there is nothing in this film that you haven't seen dozens of times before. I'll give one more example. A crew member from the tug enters a deserted and half-wrecked ballroom (cf., ""The Shining"") and finds a lighted cigarette in an ash tray. In the Twilight Zone episode it was a cigar.I won't go on about this movie because it's not worth it. Kids might enjoy the shocks. They're kind of naive about such things.",Ghost Ship
10,Tweekums,Creepy but not really scary,7,2 November 2009,"While this isn't a great film it wasn't terrible either. It suffers somewhat from having an opening scene which is the most shocking in the whole film; after seeing all but one person dancing on a ship's deck sliced in half by a cable it is hard to produce more action of that level. I think it would have been better to save this scene for later in the film, we saw part of it again in flashback later anyway.After that initial scene, which was set in 1962, we move to the present day where the crew of a salvage tug are approached by a pilot who has seen a large ship drifting in the Bering Straits. He is willing to tell them where it is for a finders fee and insists on going with them to ensure they don't rip him off. When they get there they find the liner we saw in the opening scene, obviously after so long adrift it isn't the beautiful vessel it once was. They set off to explore the ship to see if it is fit to be towed back to port, they find that it is holed beneath the water line so will need patching before they can do anything else. It is clear that something strange is going on, one of the crew keeps seeing the little girl who appeared to survive the accident we saw at the start of the film and finds the ship's pool littered with used shell cases suggesting something more than an accident happened all those years ago. They think things are looking up when they find crates of gold on board, enough that they think they can just take the gold back to their tug and leave the liner... some one or something has other ideas and causes a gas explosion that sinks the tug leaving them stranded on the sinister liner.The cast does a reasonable job in particular Gabriel Byrne as the tugs captain and Julianna Margulies as Maureen Epps, the crew member who sees the young girl. The special effects are good enough and there are a few chilling moments although no real scares.",Ghost Ship
11,BA_Harrison,Set sail for terror.,7,7 September 2009,"It's all aboard for spooky thrills and gory spills in Ghost Ship, a slick supernatural horror from director Steve Beck (who brought us the equally polished Thir13en Ghosts) that launches itself at full steam ahead with a particularly memorable opening scene—an entire room of cruise-ship passengers are graphically sliced in half when a metal cable whips across the dance-floor.The film then slows to a more leisurely speed to introduce Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) and his salvage crew (Julianna Margulies, Ron Eldard, Isaiah Washington, Alex Dimitriades and Karl Urban), who return home after six months at sea to be offered the opportunity of a lifetime by pilot Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington): the recovery of an Italian liner, the Antonia Graza, which mysteriously disappeared at sea forty years earlier.Once on board the ship—a rusting, abandoned hulk adrift in international waters—our plucky seafarers stumble across a fortune in gold bullion, but soon get that sinking feeling when they discover that the boat is haunted and it looks unlikely that any of them will ever set foot on dry land again.Despite almost being scuppered by a plot that takes a little too much swallowing at times, and suffering from a rather uneventful middle act, Ghost Ship is still a very entertaining popcorn horror: the cast all acquit themselves well, with Margulies proving to be a particularly capable lead; the set design, gore and digital effects are all top notch; there is some welcome nudity from hottie Francesca Rettondini, who plays a very sexy ghost; and director Beck successfully steers the film back on course for an exciting and surprisingly uplifting climax, followed by a pretty neat twist ending.",Ghost Ship
12,moonspinner55,Exceedingly mean-spirited horror outing...the director's rage upstages the on-screen action,4,5 August 2015,"40 years after an ocean-liner is beset with tragedy while on a voyage, a salvage crew in the Bering Sea comes across the drifting vessel, thought to have capsized. Director Steve Beck takes a standard haunted-house-at-sea scenario and spikes it with a viciousness that transposes everything else on-screen; the plot, the characters, the performances and the technical achievements of ""Ghost Ship"" each end up taking a backseat to this filmmaker's penchant for rage and torment (which is something to see but distinctly unpleasant, and difficult to shake off). Beck didn't double as screenwriter for ""Ghost Ship"" (it was penned by Mark Hanlon and John Pogue, who may be harboring demons of their own), however it's the raw-nerve handling of this bloody tale that one ends up remembering. Rarely have I seen a horror movie of any era wherein the filmmaker's hostility (a deliberate, passionate hostility, one simmering in bad vibrations) completely overtook his own production. ** from ****",Ghost Ship
13,dbdumonteil,an honest horror movie. Starring Gabriel Byrne,6,10 December 2004,"The third movie produced by the production company ""Dark Castle"" and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis, ""Ghost Ship"" (2002) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies, ""the House on the Haunted Hill"" (1999) and ""13 Ghosts"" (2001). This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects. It is all the more positive as with ""Ghost Ship"", we deal with a B movie. Another good point: the change of scenery. It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship.If the screenplay doesn't avoid all the Hollywood conventions, neither all the clichés of the horror film, the director Steve Beck makes up for it by shrouding his movie an atmosphere of mystery as soon as the crew discovers the ship. He's also imposing (slowly but surely) a progressive rise of the tension which reaches its climax in the end. The result: we come in for a few real moments of fright and Beck, in the long run puts the spectator in his pocket.As far as the cast is concerned, there are two surprises. First: Julianna Margulies who for once decided to give up scalpels in the ""ER"" series and especially Gabriel Byrne. An ambitious actor who isn't reluctant to sometimes act in a horror movie which is potboiler for him like ""End of Days"" (1999) or ""Stigmata"" (1999).It is a shame that the end isn't really satisfying and suits badly to the whole. But no matter, ""Ghost Ship"" remains a nice little horror movie whose main function is to make shiver. For this, it reaches its goal. One last thing, if the movies that come out of the ""Dark Castle"" production company keep on gaining in quality, maybe will they create a masterpiece one day...NB:it borrows a bit from ""shining"".",Ghost Ship
14,Quinoa1984,Nothing prize worthy by any means...,3,25 October 2002,"Ghost Ship attempts at smart special effects, such as an ingeniously gruesome introduction, but the production values have a bit of horror B-films from the fifties, which is almost noteworthy, but the basic story and executions are found pretty much in House on Haunted Hill and Thirteen Ghosts (all three films done by Dark Horse), with a character that takes a group of adventure seekers to a haunted place, here a ghost ship, and then it unfolds just like a haunted house story, only on a boat.  I'd say, sneak in for the first scene, and split to Red Dragon, but that's just me. C-",Ghost Ship
15,BandSAboutMovies,Great beginning...,6,4 June 2019,"Steve Beck came from ILM - where he did effects on The Abyss, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Hunt for Red October - before he directed 2001's Thir13en Ghosts. The follow-up, Ghost Ship, starts with one of the most audacious openings I've ever seen in a horror film.That first scene, set in May of 1962 aboard the Italian ocean liner SS Antonia Graza, features a crowd of wealthy passengers dancing to Francesca singing ""Senza Fine."" Katie Harwood, a young girl, is all alone until the ship's captain offers to dance with her. Just then, a hand unleashes hell: a spool of wire snaps across the dance floor, slicing every single person in half except for Katie, whose height spares her.Fast forward forty years and the crew of the Arctic Warrior - Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies), Greer (Isaiah Washington), Munder (Karl Urban), Santos and Dodge - join a Canadian pilot to salvage what's left of the Antonia Graza.One by one, a series of supernatural events wipe the crew out, slasher movie style. This is a movie unafraid to wipe characters out left and right, leaving behind chunks of them in its wake. Seriously. Don't get attached to anyone.The real tale is that one of these characters is a salvager of souls, a job earned thanks to a lifetime of sin. The gold on board the Antonia Graza is just a trap to collect more and more souls, keeping it afloat until enough souls are collected and management is happy.Ghost Ship started as Chimera, a spec script by Mark Hanlon, which was a bloodless psychological thriller with nothing supernatural or all that gory in it. A crew of four scavengers goes mad and each one plots to kill the other three. Yet by the time the film hit the big screen, the script had already undergone extensive rewrites. The actors and crew didn't know that, having signed on for one movie and ending up in a slasher, thanks to those aforementioned radical changes by Joel Silver and his associates.That said - Photon FX did a great job here. They had a lot of pride on the line, as this was the largest FX shoot in Australia to date. So they went overboard and the results still hold up 17 years later, as both the open and close feature incredible visuals.This was the first Dark Castle Entertainment horror film released based on an original concept, as the company was originally intended to only remake William Castle films.",Ghost Ship
16,Coventry,Love Boat' out of hell!!,6,16 February 2004,"I'm rather pleasantly surprised after seeing Ghost ShipI expected it to be a lot sillier, more dumb and inferior than it actually is. Still a long way from being a good horror film but a step in the right direction, to say the least. Cast and crew paid attention to building up a horrifying atmosphere instead of attacking the audience with lame and violent killing scenes. That's an effort that gets my appreciation. The vicious opening sequence is professional horror a scene that grabs you by the throat and demands your complete attention and curiosity for the rest of the movie. The high quality level is held up a little while longer but unfortunately it loses his grip during the second half. For as long as the mysterious, deserted ship is portrayed as a complete riddle, the film is fascinating, interesting and beautifully shot. As soon as a few plot-aspects are clarified, Ghost Ship turns into a mediocre and predictable thrillerI'm convinced that, with a slightly more intelligent script, this could have become one of the better horror-thrillers since the new Millennium. Now, it's only regarded as a reasonable and decent effort that lacks a bit of talent. Nonetheless, the settings and decors make it worth watching. The graphic decorations aren't overused, so it remains a beautiful experience to observe at least once. Gabriel Byrne is acting far below his normal standards and yet he's still great! All the other cast-members are pretty uninspired and forgettable. I'd describe Ghost Ship as a nice waste of time. If you have the opportunity, I advise you to search for an 80's horror title called `Death Ship'a terrific piece of trash of which Ghost Ship borrowed a lot of ideas.",Ghost Ship

With the laws of the sea stating that they can keep what they find, they are delighted to find gold on board. But it's not long before strange things start to happen.It starts of real well with a bloody and gruesome prelude, the production design is super and everything is in place for a chiller out there in the foggy waters. Unfortunately what we actually get is a predictable series of clichés cribbed from better movies of the past, none of which capable of eliciting a genuine scare.

The captain Sean Murphy realizes the vessel in front of hem disappeared in 1962 and being a film instead of sailing in the opposite direction decides to board the boat with his crew of stereotypes I'll say one good thing about GHOST SHIP and that is it exceeded my very low expectations in abundance . From the opening shots where the titles have bright neon letters to the opening hook involving mass death which gives the impression it's going to be arty and inoffensive at the same time I thought I'd be watching an abysmal unoriginal movie Let's not beat about the bush . There's nothing original about the premise where a mode of transport such as a car or a spaceship just happens to stop somewhere that has a haunted house or haunted spaceship . I was shocked that there was no thunder or lightening happening which is the closest you get to originality with GHOST SHIP . As things progress the clichés come thick and fast and you're reminded of other movies but not necessarily better ones because what GHOST SHIP does it does very well as characters split up , wander down dark corridors and get subjected to jump scares and occasionally nasty fates .

20,Hey_Sweden,Terror on the high seas.,5,21 June 2015,"This decidedly average horror film is reasonably well made on a technical level, but watching it is likely to give some genre fans a serious case of deja vu. It may suit viewers who want no more than an hour and a half of doom & gloom and gore, but it doesn't offer anything out of the ordinary. It never is able to top its opening bloody set piece, which is pretty over the top, amusing, and the only memorable component of this thing.After this opening set piece, detailing the graphic demise of the crew & passengers of an ocean liner in 1962, the action flashes forward 40 years. In 2002, a tugboat / maritime salvage team get wind of the presence of this long lost ship in international waters. Lured in by their potential cash windfall, they set out to find it. Well, they find it, all right, but they also discover a sinister otherworldly presence that is determined to decimate them just as it caused wholesale slaughter 40 years ago.""Ghost Ship"" does have good sets and decent atmosphere going for it. It has an appropriately dreary colour scheme, and moody photography supervised by Gale Tattersall. The music by John Frizzell likewise helps to make things somewhat enjoyable. The cast do their best with the so-so material: the lovely Julianna Margulies as Epps, a strong female character, Gabriel Byrne, as her father figure / boss, Ron Eldard (Juliannas' real-life boyfriend at the time), Karl Urban, and Alex Dimitriades as assorted crew, and Isaiah Washington as the first mate. Young Emily Browning is good as the girl who tries to warn Margulies of the danger.Watchable enough for 91 minutes but pretty forgettable once it's over. It tends to get less interesting as it goes along, with the characters just abruptly losing any sense of purpose and blindly falling victim to hallucinations and the machinations of the evil entity. It's also hurt by a very annoying and clichéd ending.Five out of 10.",Ghost Ship
21,preppy-3,Atmospheric,5,15 May 2006,"OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.So-so. The movie LOOKS good (the deserted vessel is impressive) but the story is slow and the characters are never fully realized. Also top billed Gabriel Byrne (giving a terrible performance) is hardly in the movie. On the plus side Julianna Margulies is good and a strong female character (unusual in any horror movie) and Alix Dimitriades and Ron Eldard are good as members of the crew. Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. But the slow pace and a predictable and stupid ending sinks this (sorry). I can only give this a 5.",Ghost Ship

Murphy & his crew agree & they set sail, they find the boat which happens to a huge Italian cruise liner called the Antonia Graza which mysteriously disappeared in 1962 without trace.

To make matters worse it has a huge hole in it & will sink within a few days, then there's the strange ghostly goings on which become ever more unpleasant & deadly as the truth behind the ship's dark past is revealed...This American Australian co-production was directed by Steve Beck for the then newly formed Dark Castle Entertainment production company, Ghost Ship was the third film from Dark Castle following the two remake's House on Haunted Hill (1999) & Thir13en Ghosts (2001) both of which were perfectly entertaining films, Ghost Ship was the first of their films to be based on an original idea although I use the word original rather lightly. Anyway, the script here by Mark Hanlon & John Pogue is reasonable fun & makes for a decent enough haunted ship chiller. It moves along at a nice pace although by the end of the film I was becoming bored of seeing people randomly walk around dark corridors, luckily to balance these scenes things always seem to happen to them at some point so all the walking around to pad the running time out does have it's pay-off which is nice. The character's are a touch one dimensional but no ones going to watch a film called Ghost Ship & expect anything deep or meaningful, are they? I must admit I quite liked the satisfying twist ending(s) & I didn't see it coming either, I also liked the back-story given to the ghost ship with the haunted & cursed gold & the events of it's dark past. So what we have in a nutshell is a decent teen horror with some gory moments, a fair amount of bad language some gratuitous nudity & a run time that doesn't outstay it's welcome, I liked it because it entertained me & it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Beck OK, the film is nice enough to look at & there are a few stylish scenes especially the niftily edited fun flashback when the original passengers were killed. This film is not a remake of or has any connection to either The Ghost Ship (1943) or Ghost Ship (1952) & in fact has more in common with Death Ship (1981) although they are still two very different films. There's some gore here although after the initial showstopper gore filled scene at the start it becomes surprisingly tame, expect for that totally cool opening massacre there's a slit throat, some gory gunshot wounds, someone is literally mashed to pieces between to huge cogs & someone swings when they get a crane hook stuck under their chin.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 this had a decent budget but when compared to the $100,000,000 plus budgets of the biggest Hollywood productions it pales into comparison, it's well made which is alright but it can feel a bit too 'staged' at times if you know what I mean. The CGI effects are good, the make-up effects are as well & it has good production values. The acting is serviceable, most of the bland cast members put in forgettable if adequate performances. The only actor with any class here is Byrne who does OK.Ghost Ship is an enjoyable big budget popcorn special effects laden horror which provides both a fair amount of undemanding fun & entertainment, well that's my opinion anyway & I'm sticking to it!",Ghost Ship
23,Boba_Fett1138,"""Ghost Ship"" passes under the radar.",5,8 November 2005,"""Ghost Ship"" is an average horror flick that desperately tries hard to be clever. It makes the story highly unlikely, even for an horror movie, and full of odd moments that are left unexplained. The plot twist towards the ending is lame and unnecessary. The same goes for the last sequences, that was just, well..odd. They tried to create a surprise ending but instead it was weird and perhaps even laughable.This movie is a waste of a great cast. Julianna Margulies shows that she can also be a good leading lady in movies and Gabriel Byrne is always excellent but he simply is too good for a role and movie like this one. He seemed out of place. The movie also features Karl Urban before he got real fame for playing in the final two Lord of the Rings movies.The movie is good looking and has some nice looking effects and sets. The movie might be a bit too dark to watch at times but it still has an overall good and professional look. The movie doesn't look like a B-movie but the story makes this movie nothing more than this.With it's opening the movie begins really promising. It was one of the better movie openings I had seen in a while to be honest. After that the movie becomes more and more uninteresting and little happens on the screen. The movie doesn't has much scares for an horror movie and lacks some truly original moments. The movie does feature some good moments such as the earlier mentioned opening sequences and the flashback sequence towards the ending of the movie that was very well constructed. It makes ""Ghost Ship"" a watchable movie but fans of the horror genre will find little joy or originality in this movie.A movie that's watchable for just once maybe.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Ghost Ship
24,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Water-borne terror,6,17 June 2008,"All I knew about this going in was what I'd heard years back about the, as described in Crazy Credits, ""infamous opening""(which is, indeed, well-done). It turned out that the cast also mostly consists of people I have not been exposed to elsewhere, with Byrne, Harrington and the ER woman being the only I had watched at least some other things of, mentioned in order of most to least amount of such. It is quite enjoyable, and I have gotten the impression that this is widely disliked, and I'm not sure it truly deserves so. There are definitely silly moments, and the end, while not bad, could have been both more built up and satisfying beyond what it was. A time or two, the music really doesn't agree with the screen. The acting could be stronger. But it's entertaining. The horror can be rather effective, and as has been pointed out before, this can be very atmospheric(and darn creepy). While there are violent and gory parts(literally), it doesn't overwhelm you with either. The shocks tend to be pretty well-done. There are cool bits herein, the adventure was fairly good, and that's from someone who isn't inclined to care for that. The story is reasonable. More development could have been put in the movie itself, but for what it's worth, it's a fun 90 minutes. Don't expect too much depth and you can find this worth a viewing. In addition to what I've already mentioned, there is a little nudity, as well as language. I recommend this to fans of horror/thriller and the people who made the film. 6/10",Ghost Ship

If they salvage this ship it would be a gold mine and they'd be set for life.This movie is called ""Ghost Ship.""Using a sliding scale for scary movies, ""Ghost Ship"" is fine. Most horrors are terrible anyway. The set was astonishing. The bulk of the movie took place on an old rusted out ocean liner and I thought they captured that really well. But I'd say that the movie was just a matter of waiting for the inevitable. The team of salvagers were five men and a woman plus one wild card who found the ship and insisted on tagging along. Horror movie law states that the woman must survive. This has been violated occasionally such as in ""Deep Blue Sea,"" but it is double-rainbow rare that someone other than the woman survives. So, knowing that Epps (Julianna Margulies) was the only woman aboard the ghost ship, it was a given that she would live. Now, would anyone else live? That was the only real question.The supernatural occurrences were rather weak. Santos (Alex Dimitriades), the mechanic, was killed because a ghost turned on the propane in the engine room. One CGI blast later he was dead. If they wanted to score points they would've shown the blast searing his skin off or something. Greer (Isaiah Washington), the first mate, died trying to get freaky with a ghost. Another illustration that men can be duped with the promise of sex even in the most dire situations. We don't know how Murphy (Gabriel Byrne), the captain, died except he was drowned in an aquarium. And we don't know how Dodge (Ron Eldard) died at all.So, what did we end up with?Set: cool.Backstory of Ghost Ship: also cool.Predictability: yes.Plot: so-so.Action: also so-so.Net result: I can stomach watching once, wouldn't watch twice.",Ghost Ship

Ghost Ship is about the same level of stupidity as 13 Ghosts. They are both graphic and violent plus they contain the stupidest people on the planet. Plot regards a group called salvagers although we can call them morons, idiots, nitwits, fruitcakes, whatever you wish. They discover a ship deemed lost but deemed found for this embarrassing peep show. Then the crew die in graphic methods that leave viewers yawning. Steve Beck handles the action more effectively than he did with that other embarrassment 13 Ghosts. The wasted cast include Julianna Margulies, Gabriel Byrne, Isaiah Washington, and Ron Eldard. Margulies believes that she sees a girl on board the ship. We even have an early appearance by Emily Browning who will go on to far greater things. That could be a strong indication that she had too much to drink before the shoot. They spend much time running and timing that perfect opportunity to have their guts splattered all over the wall like a bad interior decorator's job. It is a visual feast about past evil that lie in wait but the only thing audiences are waiting for is the credit roll so that they can get off this ship and forget it ever existed.

Emily Brown appears as a 12 year-old girl. Julianna Margulies looks fine but they don't do enough with her. Francesca Rettondini is also on hand. Let's just say the low-budget ""Ghost Voyage"" (2008) is better in the area of women.Still, the ship sets are excellent and it certainly seems like they shot the film on a real vessel. Interestingly, the Antonia Graza of the movie is a replica of the Andrea Doria. Other positives include: The refreshing score with ""Not Falling"" by Mudvayne thrown in for good measure; a nice haunting atmosphere at sea with one creepy scene reminiscent of the excellent ""Dead Calm"" (1989); potent visuals of the formidable vessel looming over the tugboat; plus some good thrills, notably one of the greatest horror scenes in the history of cinema in the prologue, no kidding. There's also a decent revelation thrown in at the end.If you like this one be sure to check out the aforementioned ""Ghost Voyage,"" which is a TV movie.

29,zetes,Half and half,5,4 April 2003,"Now this I would call exactly an average film. For me, it landed precisely at the very center of imdb's 10 point scale, right at 5.5. This means that I found exactly as much to like as I did to dislike. There is a bit of inspiration here, but just as much that's stolen from other better horror movies. If it had opted for tone and real fear instead of cheap shocks, the movie could have been great. The story is good enough that it could have been great if handled well. But we do live in these times, and, although there are scholars of the modern era who would try to have us believe that the current generation consists of a bunch of kids who get everything instantly and process it on a billion levels at once, the truth is indeed the exact opposite. No, there is no subtlety here. It would go over your average teenager's head in a heartbeat. Nope, better play it safe and provide us with a gruesome scene up front where a couple of dozen people are sliced in half by a loose cable during a ball. Gore is not scary. I did however produce a dry heave during this sequence, which is more than I can say for any other gore scene that I've viewed lately. As the gore accumulates, I began to appreciate the artistry that was put into the enormous number of deaths. These are some sickeningly creative people, let me tell you. Unfortunately, the director (or screenwriters or whoever) ruins any real potential by revealing every detail about what happened on the titular boat in a fast-motion sequence accompanied by techno music! It's the kind of moment where you just slap your head for the lack of talent involved. And then there was more stuff I liked. For example, the art direction is very impressive. The revelation of one character's identity, while not particularly surprising, is at least somewhat new. I give this film a 5/10, rounding down because I felt the final moment was a bit groan-inducing.",Ghost Ship

It was a bit PCish too.  It finally picked up on the boat. There was some scary scenes.  It had a predictable ending.  The leading lady should of stayed on TV,; she is not that great of an actress.

33,JamesHitchcock,Will appeal to those who not only have a strong stomach for violent death but also take a positive relish in it,4,13 November 2009,"Despite the coincidence of titles, this ""Ghost Ship"" is not a remake of the Mark Robson film of the same name from 1943. Robson's film was a psychological drama which could also be read as an allegory of Fascism. It contained no supernatural elements; the use of the word ""ghost"" in the title was purely metaphorical.In Steve Beck's film, by contrast, the ship featured in the movie is a ghost ship in the literal meaning of the term. Or perhaps I should say in both literal meanings of the term, as the expression can refer not only to a haunted ship but also one which has been found abandoned and drifting on the ocean; the ""Mary Celeste"" is the most famous example of a ""ghost ship"" in this second sense.A salvage crew based in Alaska receive a report of a mysterious vessel adrift in the Bering Sea, and decide to try and bring it into port for its salvage value. They discover that it is the Antonia Graza, an Italian ocean liner which has not been seen since it mysteriously disappeared in May 1962. As the ship disappeared off the coast of Labrador and has now equally mysteriously reappeared on the opposite side of the North American continent, the crew really ought to have realised that something strange is going on, and so it proves. When they board the Antonia Graza they discover that it is indeed a ghost ship in the other sense of the term, haunted by the ghosts of all those who died on it. One by one the salvagers begin to die gruesome deaths, and we find out what happened to the original passengers and crew, although we have been given a foretaste in a particularly horrific (if implausible) opening scene.The film will doubtless appeal to many lovers of violent horror, but it did not appeal to me at all. I have no objection to violence or bloodshed in films where it serves some purpose, but ""Ghost Ship"" is the sort of film which offers up gore by the bucketload as routine entertainment. The plot is also illogical, confusing and full of holes; we learn, for example, that some of the crew of the Antonia Graza organised a massacre of everyone else on board in the hope of stealing the cargo of gold that the ship was carrying. (Like they were going to dock in New York and start unloading the gold, hoping that no-one would notice upwards of a thousand corpses littering the decks?) It also transpires that everything has been choreographed by a devil who hopes to win Brownie points with Satan by bringing him a whole shipload of damned souls.Overall, ""Ghost Ship"" is not a complete disaster; the special effects are reasonably well done and the acting, while not brilliant, is at least adequate. It is not, however, a film that will appeal to everyone. Indeed, it is unlikely to appeal to anyone other than to those cinema-goers (and there appear to be a depressingly large number of them) who not only have a strong stomach for violent death but also take a positive relish in it. 4/10",Ghost Ship

There is way too many obvious plot holes and stuff that happens in this movie just doesn't make any sense, especially when the twist hits. There is almost no character development in this, so I didn't give a crap who lives or who dies and got tedious pretty quickly. The movie first starts in a ship during the 1960's and after the first scene, I expected it to be a gruesome and yet kinda entertaining movie. The thing is the impact of the first scene isn't carried out throughout most of the movie, and just comes off cheesy and lame. It's basically a ""B"" movie and for a ""B"" movie it's alright.

38,OllieSuave-007,A creepy and gory ship.,6,3 May 2014,"This ghost movie begins with the brutal and sudden death for passengers of an ocean-liner, a gripping scene that starts the movie off with much intrigue. It then leads to the present day where a salvage crew discovers the long-lost ship in a remote region of the Bering Sea. As they begin to tow it back to land, paranormal events soon happen to them.The story's plot has some creepy and hair-raising moments you've come to expect from ghost/horror movies, and the story takes a turn when the apparition of the young girl reveals herself to the salvage crew and foretells the dark and brutal history of the passengers and crew of the ship. It then all leads to a race for survival for the salvage crew.I thought, though, that the movie's latter half is just a lot of running around and people trying to survive ***spoiler ahead*** the main, evil ghost named Ferriman (Desmond Harrington), who uses gold on the ship as bait to get the crew and passengers, from the beginning of the movie, to turn on each other, resulting in their untimely deaths. This deviates from any surprises or plots twists in the film, all leading to a pretty predictable outcome. However, I thought the ending scene was confusing and leaves a cliffhanger.Overall, it's an action-packed movie with OK acting, but with limited suspense towards the latter half of the movie.Grade C",Ghost Ship
39,sddavis63,It Gets Progressively Sillier As It Goes On,3,16 March 2010,"The movie begins with what I would have to describe as one of the goriest scenes I've ever seen, as in 1962 a thin cable is let loose during a dance on a cruise ship, which proceeds to slice everyone (except for one horrified young girl) in half. It was gory - very gory. Having said that, it also gave me a little bit of hope, because it seemed to set up a possibility for a non-supernatural explanation for what comes next. Fast forward 40 years. A salvage team is tipped off to the cruise ship's discovery. It's simply floating through the Bering Sea, available for the taking. The crew sets out, finds the ship and starts the salvage operation, but there's definitely something wrong with the ship. I had half hoped that the strange happenings would be the result of the little girl having found a way to survive all those years, now being alone and probably insane on board. That was my hope. I thought that would have made a decent movie. Instead, once the salvage crew are on the ship, this turns into a not especially original ghost story that gets progressively silly until the final scene. If the opening scene was one of the goriest I've ever seen, that final scene has to rank as one of the silliest I've ever seen. Add to the story - which gets weaker and weaker as the movie goes on - an incredibly irritating musical score, and this ranks as a real disappointment.

40,sol-kay,Arctic Mystery,6,11 January 2004,"******SPOILERS****** The movie ""Ghost Ship"" starts out with a beautiful musical and dancing sequence on the Italian luxury liner ""Antonia Graza"" sailing off the cost of Labrador in May 1962. For a moment you think that your watching something like an episode from the TV show ""The Love Boat"" instead of a horror movie. Then all of a sudden without warning your hit with one of the bloodiest and grisliest scenes in motion picture history. The movie then goes forward to 2002 where a salvage crew headed by Captain Murphy, Gabriel Byrne, is approached by a pilot from the Canadian Arctic Patrol Jack Ferriman, Desmond Harrington. Capt. Murphy is told about a huge ship that Ferriman photographed in the Bering Sea recently and if he's interested in finding it. Captain Murphy and Ferriman come to an agreement for a 90/10 split, 90% for Murphy and the crew of his boat the ""Arctic Warrior"" and 10% for Ferriman, with him coming along, in whatever they find on the ship. Reaching the ship Captain Murphy realizes that it's the long lost Italian Ocean Liner ""Antonia Graza"". As Murphy's crew enters the ship they slowly begin to sense that it's haunted as it slowly comes to life with it's long dead crew and passengers.Those of us watching the movie begin to see what really happened on that ship back in 1962 when it disappeared and what happened then wasn't an accident like we were led to believe. Also we find out what was the real reason for Ferriman to get the captain and his crew of the ""Arctic Warrior"" on board that ship. Not as bad a movie as you might think with the movie never lagging even though it's story-line is a bit over-the-top. The plot did get somewhat muddled when the live crew of the ""Arctic Warrior"" got into some kind of time warp with the dead passengers and crew of the ill-fated Ocean Liner ""Antonia Graza"".There was a very good flashback that tried to explain why those on the ship suffered the terrible fate that they did. Still there were too many lose ends in the story to make it a very good horror movie which it seemed like at the beginning and ended up just being an average one at the end. One thing about the movie even though it at first seemed to be a film about men at work in the cold Arctic region the most interesting people in the movie were women. The first was Maureen Epps, Julianna Margulies, who was undoubtedly the heroine of the movie and as tough as any of the men on the salvage crew with her. And then there was Katie, Emily Browning, the cute and adorable little ghost girl who tried to get those of the salvage crew off the ship because of the real reasons that they were tricked into getting on it. Then there was Francesca, Francesca Rettondini, the singer on the cruse ship when that horrible carnage happened back in 1962. Even though she was dead for some 40 years Francesca was so hot every time that she came on the screen that the temperature in those cold Arctic waters must have risen some 30-40 degrees. Francesca was such a knock out that she had one of the crew members Greer, Isaiah Washington, so turned on that he fell for her straight down an elevator shaft.",Ghost Ship
41,lost-in-limbo,Superb entertainment... for only 5mins!,3,4 February 2005,"A salvage crew discovers a lifeless sea-liner, when aboard weird things begins to happen and in doing so it prevents them from leaving.Gosh! What a great opening 5 minutes of bloody macabre- but to bad about the rest of the film! It had a good cast and excellent production valves- but I couldn't say the same about the stale and humourless story by Hanlon and unoriginal and slow directing by Steve Beck.With it falling in the same old clichés and being ridiculously boring and inane, that you couldn't care less what happen the further along it went and the predictable twist didn't help either. The dialogue was so uninteresting between the characters and the story was that crystal-clear you could actually pin point what was going to happen before it has hit the screen. Not helping the cause was such head splitting clichés like *hmm* was that a ghost I saw? Lets separate oh no someone is dead, okay lets now go off on our own again, were trap on the ship, dead bodies popping up, a good ghost who wants to help, someone evil among the group and the big surprise... What? It's a set up! The performances were reasonable too really flat- but for me they didn't look that interested and lacked charisma in their parts. Especially the wasted Gabriel Byrne- but I thought he gave the best performance and that's not saying much at all, while Julianna Margulies was just plain irritating and as well as Desmond Harrington's dazed and confused facials throughout the film.The special effects and set designs look pretty flashy, but it really didn't create any type of atmosphere at all it was too artificial to create any sense of doom or horror. Though the blood and gore was kinda graphic- but it suffered the further along the film went. There's no denying it that the gruesome deaths were just basically a show piece to shock the audience- but it actually started to wear thin the further it went on.Not the worst I've seen, because of a brilliant and quite original opening- but please fellas a better story, with some atmosphere next time.1.5/5",Ghost Ship
42,bowmanblue,Hauntingly average,5,11 March 2019,"I think I've watch 'Ghost Ship' between 2-3 times. I think I'll say twice. The reason I can't remember is that, even though I've only watched it a few days ago, I'm already starting to forget what happened. Although, saying that, the one thing I can always remember is the beginning. It's a classic moment of horror that will come out of nowhere and stick with you (well... it certainly stuck with me!). It's just a pity everything else in the film comes across as so 'below standard.'A crew of - mainly disposable - characters board a passenger liner that's been missing for several decades in the hope of scoring some major bounty. Guess what they find instead? Hint: the clue's in the film's title.And so they get picked off one by one, sometimes in gruesome ways, other times way that I can't really remember. Gabriel Byrne is in it. I remember remembering him the first time round. I don't think I'd heard of the film's leading lady (Julianna Margulies) when I first watched it and, now I've seen her in it again, I still don't think she's been in anything else I've watched (or at least noticed her in). Now, some several years later I notice that the cast list also has a young Emily Browning (who is actually pretty good for a child actor and you can see that she was going to go further than this floating vessel of a film), plus Karl Urban who does nothing here to show that one day he'll actually be a damn sight better than his performance in 'Ghost Ship' allows him.Ultimately, 'Ghost Ship' is one of a million other forgettable horror films which you won't remember by the time the credits roll. As I said, the only really good bit happens within the first ten minutes. You can probably turn it off after that without really missing anything. However, if you do choose to have it on in the background while you do other things, you'll find it's one of those films where you can easily check your mobile phone every few minutes and still know everything that's going on onscreen.I really wish I could think anything else to say about this film, but the fact that I can't probably speaks volumes.",Ghost Ship
43,dromasca,Drowning Script,4,6 July 2003,"'Ghost Ship' is a film doomed to failure from the start because of the very bad script. The idea of setting a ghost story on a shipwreck is quite good, and could have been the source of a good film. However, logic is completely forgotten in this movie, and all the action seems to be directed towards one goal only - bring in all the possible clichees of the horror movies without any particular order or sense. The dialog suffers of unvoluntary humor, like in the key scene which is supposed to 'explain' what the movie is meant to say. Some good camera work using the abandoned ship setting, and decent acting from a team including Julianne Margulies (who deserves better roles) cannot save this film from ridicule. 4/10 on my personal scale.",Ghost Ship
44,Cineanalyst,Formulaic,2,19 August 2004,"If you don't know the formula that has been used for countless movies, including ""Death Ship"", ""Event Horizon"", haunted house flicks, even ""Deep Blue Sea"", then there might be SPOILERS herein.In ""Jaws"", three men went out to kill a monster with understanding of the monster's powers and with reasons for daring the mission. The sailors in ""Ghost Ship"" are morons. They had a fine reason to begin the mission, but from there, they do everything in their stupidity to help events with keeping them in danger longer. They have tempers, too, for they begin to yell and throw punches after one idiot irritates the other. Additionally, this is a B-grade edition of the formula, so there aren't even good special effects. Compounding all of this is that the edition is marketed to MTV viewers, so there's pop music and the editing and slow motion are in the MTV-styled rhythm. It's annoying, especially in the twist ending, which is ludicrous because if you know the formula, which is about the only driving reason to want to see this movie, then you already know that a twist at the end is likely. (I saw the movie indifferently, free of financial cost, by the way.)Apparently, many do enjoy watching formulaic movies, so here's the fun I tried to have: I guessed who would die and in what order. It was obvious that the woman would survive because the focus is on her from the beginning of the present-day thread. She has a relationship bordering on kinship with the captain, so that makes it likely that his death will be the most dramatic. The black guy was right too often, so he'll die, because who wants him spoiling the idiocy (plus, you know, racially-charged trope). None of the others matter, especially jocular buddies; they're only there to die. I didn't guess the order correctly, but I was right about everything I just mentioned.",Ghost Ship
45,cricketbat,Kind of drifts off course after a strong beginning,6,20 October 2021,"Ghost Ship launches into the story with a truly unforgettable moment, but then the movie slowly begins to drift off course until it reaches truly silly waters in the end. The final act is eye-rollingly ridiculous. However, I kind of enjoyed the journey before that. There were some creepy moments despite the reliance on gore and the poor song choices that really date the movie.

46,CuriosityKilledShawn,Full of ship.,7,29 October 2011,"The Dark Castle production company founded by Robert Zemeckis, Gilbert Adler and Joel Silver churned out a few low-brow horrors at the beginning of the last decade before producing broader, more mainstream flicks like RockNRolla and Unknown. Among the better of these schlockfests was Ghost Ship, a maritime horror set in the bleak Bearing Straight. A salvage crew featuring the underused Gabriel Byrne (replacing Brian Cox) and the lovely Julianna Margulies set out on a mission to find a mysterious floating behemoth only to discover that it's the 40-year lost Antonia Garza, a cruise ship that vanished without a trace.Once on board the salvage crew quickly begin to realize that something sinister is going on and have doubts about the completing their mission. The rusting juggernaut holds a terrifying secret and will not let them leave under any circumstances. It's an ironic morality play with a twist, much in the style of the producers' own Tales from the Crypt TV/movie series. Dark Castle were good at making this type of film, but they've shifted focus in recent years. Despite a little too much CGI blood effects, Ghost Ship still manages to be chilling and provokes a dreadful atmosphere.But where did all the dead bodies go? If you like this film then you ought to check out the similar Death Ship and Deep Rising. Neither will surface on Blu Ray any time soon, but they're worth hunting down.",Ghost Ship

It contains a decent plot that seems reasonable, the avoidance of an excessive use of gore, though the beginning, resembles a scene from The Cell and 13 Ghosts, is pretty startling induce the audience into watching the movie. Additionally, Gabriel Byrne's role towards the end was underplayed but acceptable under the circumstances. This is a easily watchable horror movie with a soul. Overall, this horror, thriller has good production values, a consistent, intelligent script making it a good Halloween entertainment value along with the typical last twist. You can see a more sublime story with Nomads (1986).",Ghost Ship

Karl Urban and Gabriel Byrne are a delight. So much of the bulk of the film is definitely horror I don't know why a few said it's not.

52,filipemanuelneto,Interesting ... but could be better.,7,27 September 2016,"When we think we've seen a bit of everything in horror, comes a movie that surprises us with something new. It can be good or bad, better or worse achieved, but has the added value of novelty. This is one of this cases: movies about haunted houses come in droves, but movies about haunted ships is something different. The director (Steve Beck) and screenwriter (Mark Hanlon) did a reasonable job and got a very interesting story, without the dead times and gratuitous violence that infest the actual horror films. The cast, headed by Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies, also did a decent job, although I believe that Byrne would be able to admit that this was not one of his best films.Blood abounds, there are scenes able to revolve the stomach and times when we really got stuck to the screen, but its not an overly graphic film. Everything rests beautifully in a slightly blurred picture, a very threatening and gloomy environment discreetly accentuated by sound effects. The decadent scenarios of the ship were designed in the smallest details, and are elegantly compared to their ""original"" aspect, through the use of a kind of ""hallucinations"" that closely resemble temporal flashbacks. One of the most impressive moments of the film, however, is its opening scene. Its something that we simply are not expecting to see. The end is not as strong because we, from the middle, can predict some of the key points in the outcome, removing impact to the climax. In the middle of the film, the director and screenwriter were lost, revealing themselves unable to better develop the plot.I confess that this film impressed me when I saw it for the first time. I loved it then, and it still is one of my favorite horror movies, by its potential and its scowling environment more than by it's quality. Not a great movie, its not a work of art, but its entertaining and gives some nice chills.",Ghost Ship

It was directed by the same guy who made the atrocious ""Thir13en Ghosts"", and just like that film, this movie was boring, cheesy, clichéd, poorly acted and written. The music is horrible too, and doesn't fit at all with the tone of the movie. All from this movie sucked. This movie sucked from beginning to end. It wasn't scary at all. It was just stupid. I cannot understand why someone would rate this above of three stars. The very first sequence, is one of the most pathetic sequences ever made in the history of cinema. I give this one star, because I can't rate it with negative score. Avoid it.",Ghost Ship
54,Anonymous_Maxine,Much better than I expected...,7,20 April 2008,"The beginning of Ghost Ship is immediately interesting in way that reminds me of the beginning of movies like Sphere or Event Horizon, or even the recent 30 Days of Night. The crew on board a salvage ship (this is convenient for the plot) comes across a massive passenger ship in an advanced state of disrepair floating aimlessly on the ocean. Upon closer inspection, they learn that it is a full-sized passenger ship that disappeared in 1962 and has been missing ever since.There is something inherently interesting in premises like this. First of all, the ocean is such a vast expanse of emptiness with such endless possibilities, and is also a place that we really know relatively little about, that it's hard to even try to imagine what kinds of things may have happened to kill an entire passenger ship full of passengers and crew, or what may have made them abandon ship en masse, especially since the ship was, ah, ship-shape enough to remain afloat for another four decades.My immediate assumption of a catastrophic sea storm didn't make much sense, since the ship remained afloat so long, and I remained hopeful that this wasn't going to turn into a monster movie, and for the most part I wasn't disappointed. Like so many other films, the worst thing about this one is the special effects which, as usual do little more than call attention to themselves as special effects. The atmosphere is remarkable, the rusty, desolated hulk brought to the screen with such realism that you can almost feel the coldness and wetness as they explore the decaying interior of the ship. In a lot of ways the movie resembles your traditional ghost story. In fact, I found it just a little disappointing that the ghost element was so strong. Of course, you have to have it, otherwise there would be no movie, but maybe here there are just a few too many age-old tricks, like mysterious opening door and visions of corpses and of course the cute little dead girl. On the other hand, with a cheesy box cover like this, I'm glad that the whole movie was a total mess.It seems that the missing ship was an Italian luxury passenger ship, so needless to say, if the crew can manage to get it back to land it could be worth millions. The crew are overcome with this possibility, even as it becomes the catalyst that begins to propel them to their deaths, one by one. In this sense the movie borders on becoming routine, although that opening scene, like the one in Cube, is definitely something to remember!!I've noticed some people point out goofs that are most certainly not goofs in this movie. One of the goofs on the IMDb goofs page claims that since the ship is floating north of the equator, it is floating in a counter-clockwise direction, so it should be it's starboard (right) side at risk of hitting land, not it's port (left) side, as in the movie. Why this use assumed that unmanned ships drift forward, as they're sailed, I can't imagine.Even more surprisingly, Roger Ebert makes the bizarre assertion that, if the ship were found in the Bering Sea, in the North Pacific, after a scheduled trip from Italy to America, then it must have sailed unnoticed and unattended through the Panama Canal, or else ""no longer plays by the rules of the physical universe."" Yeah, the Bering Sea is a long way from the North Atlantic, but the ocean is a big place and 40 years is a long time. I'm willing to bet that if you set a ship adrift anywhere in the ocean and then check back in four decades, you too might find yourself surprised at its new location. At any rate, there are definitely some shortcomings to the movie, and it is not exactly a breath of life into the struggling horror genre, but it's interesting and fun and, despite those special effects, creates exactly the atmosphere that we would expect on board a long deserted ocean liner. Except the ghosts of course, but if there were no ghosts, well then the title would just be a bare-faced lie, wouldn't it?",Ghost Ship

Ghost Ship has sat in my DVD cupboard, unwatched for probably about 10 years. Was it worth the wait? Sadly no. After a well staged, very gruesome opening scene it was all down hill from there. I thought that the CGI effects looked weak, the scares weren't scary and it was generally very mediocre. It is BBFC rated 18, which seems somewhat harsh, I've seen gorier and far more frightening 15 movies than this one.",Ghost Ship
56,jimbo-53-186511,Booooooo!!!!!,4,13 November 2019,"A salvage crew discover a ship in the Bering Sea that has been missing for the past 40 years. When they decide to investigate they get far more than they bargained for when it turns out that the people who died on-board the ship seem to still be haunting it and the majority of them don't take kindly to visitors...Ghost Ship has an interesting sounding premise and the idea of spirits inhabiting a lost and forgotten ship has bags of potential. Sadly most of it is wasted here...For a start, the film is billed as a Horror so where exactly were the scares? All I saw was a few 'peak-a-boo' moments and a number of crass and cheap attempts at jump scares many of which are so poor that they probably don't even deserve to be labelled as such . The idea of the crew venturing off separately to explore the ship should have created a suspenseful scenario, but so little is done here that it simply doesn't work; I was never once on the edge of my seat and never found myself caring about anything that happened. It doesn't help that the salvage crew themselves are so poorly developed and generally unlikeable either.Director Steve Beck's direction is all over the place as well; laboured and lethargic in its early stages and even when focusing on the action it's like he wasn't even trying. The twist at the end was blitzed through at a lightning pace through a series of flashbacks (lazy in itself when this could have been developed throughout the narrative had it contained more thought and structure).So in summary it's perhaps good for a few unintentional laughs and its short running time means its over before it starts to outstay its welcome, but nevertheless these things alone are certainly not enough to make the film worth watching.",Ghost Ship

Ghost Ship is a fun Horror Thriller & delivers on all of that with plenty of creepy moments & even some sad moments but all done with so much style & atmosphere, the production design is BEAUTIFUL!!! The look of the old Abandoned Ghost Ship is amazing i wanted to explore it lol such a great setting for a supernatural story like this.
The cast are also a great especially Genre regular Desmond Harrington, he is a very underrated but excellent actor who was also excellent as the lead in the excellent backwoods hillbilly slasher Wrong Turn (2003) & the survival Thriller Exit Speed (2008) & he has a nice ordinary guy presence to him like the old school genre heroes like Tom Atkins & Robert Forster, the rest of the cast are good also like having a veteran like Gabriel Bynne & up & coming big star like Karl Urban who is a fave of mine & is excellent in the cult classic ""Dredd"" so
great casting for this type of Horror flick & all made really well on a nice budget of 20 million, so not a cheap low budget flick but a modest budget flick.
I have always enjoyed this late night fun Horror Thriller & have watched it loads of times & will do more.A very well made pure fun Horror Thriller perfect for late night entertainment & just so damn enjoyable!!!",Ghost Ship
58,drownnnsoda,Eerie and Nicely Done Horror Film - This Ship Stays Afloat.,8,22 December 2004,"I haven't seen a horror film quite like ""Ghost Ship"" ever before. This film has a quite inventive opening scene, that displays a large group of people dancing on board a high-class Italian ocean liner. This scene seems to be set within the late 1950's to the early 1960's, and everyone is dressed in fancy clothing. Then a cable snaps and is drug through the entire crowd of people on deck- cleanly slicing each individual right across the waist, except for one little girl (might I add, this scene is very graphic). From there it follows a group of salvagers in present day including actors Gabriel Byrne (""Stigmata"") and Julianna Margulies (""ER TV series""), who are confronted by a man named Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington - ""Wrong Turn""), who spotted an ocean liner in the Bering Sea. The salvagers decide to search for the boat, and end up accidentally crashing into the side of it. When on board, the crew begins to experience a strange chain of events - apparitions of a little girl, sounds, unexplained music, doors opening and closing by themselves - yes, the average ghost activity in a supernatural horror film. Then they come across a fortune of gold. Then when their boat explodes, the crew is left on the boat, with only the gold and no way to escape. Despite some negative reviews here and there on this site, I thought ""Ghost Ship"" was a mildly predictable but very nicely done supernatural horror film that sticks out as something fairly original in the genre. This is the third film from Dark Castle Pictures, which has been releasing remakes of older supernatural-themed horror films (previously releasing the remake of ""House On Haunted Hill"" and the remake of ""Thirteen Ghosts""). I like this company and I've thoroughly enjoyed their films so far. The storyline to this film is actually really original, which is surprising since originality is hard to find in this genre. Sure, the film is fairly clichéd and it does borrow ideas, but the core of the plot is actually quite unique. The plot does become a little predictable at times, but overall it keeps you consistently interested while remaining really frightening. To go along with that, the cinematography in the film is excellent. The setting, which is mainly a dilapidated ocean liner, is very scary looking and the atmosphere and mood is set perfectly. There are quite a few scare sequences that actually got me, which was surprising. The ghosts in the film are presented in an interesting manner, and I never felt anything went too overboard - it was all quite believable. There is quite a few gory scenes, but the movie didn't rely on the violence to remain scary. Speaking of gore, I have to admit that the best part of this film was the opening scene. Not only was it unexpected, but it was so well done - the music, the costumes, and the way the entire sequence was filmed. It was an excellent (albeit gory) way to start off the film, and for me was the most memorable scene. The acting isn't bad. We have Julianna Margulies as the female heroine, who is a likable ""tough girl"", and Gabriel Byrne as the wise seaman. Desmond Harrington is also quite good in his mysterious role. And I also have to make note of Emily Browning, who played the innocent ghost girl, Katie - she's also quite a talented little actress who also plays her character well. The film's ""Titanic""-esque finale was a little contrived but satisfying, and the final frame of the movie leaves it open-ended with the sequel opportunity.Overall, ""Ghost Ship"" has very inventive sequences, a great story, and some really neat concepts. It has it's share of flaws, but overall it is an original horror film, with twists and turns and plenty of scares to please anyone who likes a good scary movie. And plus, the magnificent opening scene makes the entire movie well worth it. All in all, this is an original and very enjoyable supernatural horror movie. 8/10.",Ghost Ship

The story involves ghosts so things move without any reason, people appear and disappear again and there are sudden loud noises on the soundtrack. Things like this can work in a good movie but 'Ghost Ship' is not a good movie.So for me things didn't work. There is a small chance that it will work for you. A sudden noise could scare anybody so if you normally like movies that use tricks like these you will like 'Ghost Ship' as well. A good thing is that there are no distractions like bad acting or terrible visual effects. In fact, actors like Gabriel Byrne, Julianna Margulies, Isaiah Washington and the young Emily Browning do a pretty good job, and the visual are very decent.

I loved the 1950s style opening sequence to the film, with Julianna Margulies torch singing on an elegant passenger ship at sea. This scene climaxes with the film's most outrageous and memorable death scene, where an entire dance floor is cut in half when a steel cable snaps loose. If the film had maintained that level of over-the-top shock value, this film might have been better. Instead, like the the first ""Blade"" film with it's amazing bloodbath opening sequence, the rest of the film is a major letdown. ""Ghost Ship"" was directed by Steve Beck, who's only other directing credit is ""13 Ghosts,"" which was similarly short of plot, but strong on visual effect and style, although this film's writer is John Pogue, who wrote the underrated ""U.S. Marshals"" and the also underrated ""Quarantine 2: Terminal,"" but this script about a salvage crew (Gabriel Byrne, Ron Eldard, Isaiah Washington, Karl Urban, and Emily Browning) finding and setting out to loot the titular ghost ship killed off one-by-one in rather unmemorable fashions and amongst a lots of cheap jump-scares. It's kind of fun seeing Julianna Margulies pre-The Good Wife in such a disreputable of genre film, but that's not enough to save this dull horror flick.

Deep down in the bowels of the rusted vessel they find millions of dollars worth of gold, but before they can take it back, tragedy strikes. Their boat goes under leaving them stranded on the ship, which not only is sinking but, contains something supernatural on board.What bothers me most is not so much the fact that things get predictable, but the way it falls apart in the third act. I'm sick of climactic twists as contrived and ridiculous as Ghost Ship, it left me with numerous questions. If you are a tougher critic than me, you will find error way before that. Ghost Ship doesn't even attempt to be scary. It jumps right into establishing what kind of threat is on board, hardly the way to keep an audience going.

VIRUS was fun in a simple-minded sort of way, as a salvage crew boards an abandoned science vessel, only to be confronted by an alien life form that plans to take over mankind. In GHOST SHIP, a salvage crew boards an abandoned luxury liner, only to be confronted by the vengeful spirits of some of the long-dead passengers and crew. It is less like VIRUS or ALIENS, and more like THE SHINING. There's even a haunted ballroom scene that is reminiscent of the ballroom scene in THE SHINING. Julianna Margolies has the Sigourney Weaver/Jamie Lee Curtis role here, playing a feisty and spirited member of the salvage crew. Gabriel Byrne, clearly slumming here, plays the salvage crew's captain. The movie's most memorable scene comes in the first five minutes, when an errant cable spells doom for most of the passengers. It is a graphic but ridiculous bit of business, and the film unfortunately gets sillier and sillier as it goes along, leading to a trick ending that makes absolutely no sense. I guess we can call this THE SHINING at sea. But THE SHINING it ain't. Stick with THE SHINING.",Ghost Ship

Ghosts on a ship, so really the victims have no way of escaping and you can possibly be in for some good death scenes and a creepy atmosphere. Ghost Ship fails to deliver any of these things. Aside from a good opening scene, this movie can drown to the bottom of the sea.Byrne and crew act like pieces of wood that float down some kind of contaminated river, along with their acting chops is the script, the music composer and the director. Ghost ship simply fails to deliver good scares and creepy chills, but does leave you with a headache. Right from the beginning we get a great death scene, with a boat wire ripping through the torso's of the crew, with the exception of a small little girl, who was too short. After viewing such a good scene, one would imagine much more to come, too bad the movie takes an unexpected turn for the worse.We need to sit through horrible dialogue, even for a horror movie and one of the stupidest death scenes ever. The black guy with his pants down, falling down an elevator shaft? PLEASE!!!! If I could, I'd wrap this in a treasure chest, fill it with cement and throw it in the ocean, hoping no one will ever find it. The music does little to help with any creepy atmosphere left in the film and actually begins to irritate some. Ghost Ship manages to become one of the worst big budget horror movies created. The title for worst horror movie ever created, big or small, goes to Carnivore. In fact Carnivore is the worst movie ever made.Do yourself a favor and skip useless trash like this.

69,vengeance20,A Slash Above Lost Voyage!,8,4 June 2019,"Seen this film today & was impressed from the start!The film is about a cruise ship that goes missing in 1962 under mysterious cirmcumstances. A salvage crew go out in search for the ship and climb aboard. But they get way more than what they bargained for as things take a sinister turn...!I found the film to be quite enjoyable! More in depth than Lost Voyage and more gorier and memorable! The story-line was more interesting in this one also!The opening was pretty good, but a little anti-climatic! But it WAS a unique opening overall & one not seen alot in films like it!The ending didn't make a lot of sense & was a bit on the ""what the f-"" side of things. But that's my only issue with this one.Overall a solid watch! 8/10",Ghost Ship
70,philip_vanderveken,Too bad about those last 30 minutes.,6,24 April 2005,"The oceans of this world still keep a lot of secrets for themselves. We are able to fly to the moon, but we don't know everything about our own planet yet. This is of course also the reason why there are so many mysterious stories and legends about ships, airplanes... that have vanished in the thin air (think of the Bermuda triangle). Is anything about those stories true? Perhaps, but probably not. But that doesn't mean of course that this can't be a good source of inspiration for a new movie.And that's exactly what the makers of ""Ghost Ship"" must have thought. It's about a salvage crew that has claimed the Antonia Graza, an Italian luxury liner that has been missing since 1962 and has been floating adrift since then. But the ship isn't as uninhabited as you might expect after more than 40 years. Before they can begin repairing and towing the ghost ship towards harbor, a series of bizarre things starts to happen to the crew and they get trapped in the ship, as the prisoners of a demonic creature...During the first hour this movie really gave me a good time. I'm not saying it was the best movie ever, but it sure was some good entertainment. The only problem was that it didn't stay with that one hour. The last thirty minutes weren't any good, making me loose much of my interest. And that's too bad, because the concept of the movie really could work. The story is nice and even though this is yet another horror movie in a series of many, it has a more original approach to offer (a ghost ship isn't something that you see in every movie). But I'm afraid they messed it up pretty bad at the end of the movie and that's why I can only give it a 6/10.",Ghost Ship
71,slayrrr666,Classic ghost story,9,1 June 2006,"""Ghost Ship"" is a pretty creepy haunting movie.**SPOILERS**Years after the disappearance of a mysterious cruise-ship, undersea salvager Sean Murphy, (Gabriel Byrne) hears of it and sets off with his crew, Maureen Epps, (Julianna Margulies) Dodge, (Ron Eldard) Jack Ferriman, (Desmond Harrington) Greer, (Isaiah Washington) Santos, (Alex Dimitriades) and Munder, (Karl Urban) to find it. Going aboard, they find the ship empty and decide to tug it back in the morning. There, they discover some problems with the ship before they can bring it in, and decide to fix it on the spot. While fixing it, the group is beset by ghostly apparitions that appear intent on scaring them away from a horde of stolen gold on board the ship.The Good News: I wasn't expecting a whole lot going into this one. It surprised me a lot more than I thought it would. Most of that was due to the spectacular design of the interior of the ship that is perfectly built to generate suspense. This is one of the creepiest sets I think I've ever seen, and it creates an unbelievable atmosphere. It's eerie corridors, large empty rooms, and the general darkness of the surroundings combine into a really nicely-realized setting. The ambiance of the ship is best part of the film, and it does a brilliant job of setting it up to deliver the shocks coming later along. There a large amount o those kinds of scenes spread throughout, keeping you constantly on end about whether or not there is something there. Most of the tricks to generate suspense are used as well, from the rapidly closing rows of doors, creepy noises off-screen, to sequences where the characters shouldn't be doing what they are doing in the situation. None of the sequences are worth spoiling, so they won't be revealed. It is just a really creepy film with loads of suspense. The story of how the ship came to be haunted and the special twist associated with it is pretty nice to see, as it doesn't resort to a traditional story in any sense. It's a nice change. The biggest surprise, of course, is the spectacular opening that sets the mood for the film perfectly. It's nice and quite bloody, which is the perfect combination.The Bad News: There wasn't much wrong with this one. Once it hit the hour mark, it slowed down pretty much and changed ti's pacing. It wasn't a bad shift, but still one that's noticeable. Its not enough to diminish the entertainment factor, but it's still there.The Final Verdict: Had it kept on the pace it was going, it would've been a great film, but the shift makes it slip a little into just being a really great one. It's creepy, its fast, and it keeps you entertained, if only for the slight shift. Very recommended.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and implied child rape",Ghost Ship
72,brando647,Slightly Better Than I Remember...,5,14 April 2009,"I watched this movie again for the first time in years recently and I'm glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. I remember disliking it a lot more when I first saw the film but I wasn't as harsh on it this time around. The film follows a salvage crew led by Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) and Epps (Julianna Margulies) who are approached by mysterious stranger that gives them the offer of a lifetime: he's discovered an ocean liner adrift in the Bering Strait that could net them millions of dollars if they act fast. The ship in question is the Antonia Graza and the salvage crew will soon discover the dark secret within.I'm generally not a fan of visual effects artists who move into the director's position, as I've seen few (or none) that actually created a decent film so far. In fact, I thought Steve Beck's first directorial attempt was garbage. This film, while nothing special, still managed to entertain at least a little. The story was intriguing and (of course) the special effects were terrific. The effects in general were great but there were two instances that stuck with me after the credits began to roll: the gruesome opening sequence and the montage giving us a chance to discover what happened to the ship's passengers and crew. Both were incredibly effective and extremely well done, so I'd be wrong to say the movie was without it's merit. Some credit should also be given to the film's production design for creating an authentic feel of the Antonia Graza (both it's beauty in the 60's and it's decrepit shell 40 years later).As I said, the film does have it's more than it's share of flaws. While it has some exciting moments, the majority of the film drags on at a snail's pace. While I loved seeing the ship's interior as the salvage crew explored, there were a lot of times when I just wished SOMETHING would happen. I also had a hard time really caring about any of the crew; I'm sure if it's a result of poor writing or poor acting but rather than hope any of them pull through, I was just counting the minutes until the next under-developed character was offed in a fun way. The only exceptions to this were Gabriel Byrne as Murphy, the captain of the salvage crew, and Emily Browning as Katie (the only child amongst the original passengers of the liner). Katie is the only ""good"" spirit haunting the ship and acts as a guide for Epps throughout, and one of my favorite moments was as she was showing Epps what went down on the ship 40 years ago (especially her subtle reactions to the deaths of herself and the ship's captain).The film's pros and cons manage to balance enough to the point that it manages to avoid becoming complete crap. The film has a few ""boo"" moments and no real scares (for myself, anyways) and most of the best audience reactions are from the fantastic gore effects. My opinion? Keep your expectations pretty low and this thriller should be good for at least a viewing.",Ghost Ship
73,MartianOctocretr5,Spooky voyage - Better than most horror flicks,7,20 October 2009,"The opening scene, a deck party aboard an Italian cruise vessel in 1962, is truly brutal. Things turn gruesomely wrong in a hurry. It's an effective visual that draws you into the story immediately.Cut to four decades later. The old hulk is sighted drifting after years of mysterious Mary Celeste type absence. Some fortune hunters learn it had had some gold secrets aboard, and make a run for salvage rights. There are some curious investigators that want to solve its long disappearance. Once everybody's aboard, it soon becomes apparent there's some malicious haunting afloat.There's more attention in this film to developing a story and characters than in most horror movies. There's also some of the main stay fodder of gross outs, too, if that's what you're looking for. The scene with the canned food that keeps changing appearance is a good example of their approach. There's no shortage of tortured souls trapped on this endless voyage, either. The story follows a classic Twilight Zone design, and it works well here. The ever-increasing hostility from the evil apparitions steadily elevate the tense mood. Fine acting, balance with skillful direction. Special effects are eerie enough, and the dark, foreboding atmosphere is maintained throughout. There's something for every horror fan: malevolent spirits, a claustrophobic setting, gory violence, a mystery to solve. Recommended.",Ghost Ship
74,gedikreverdi,A charming ghost story from 2000s,7,2 June 2021,They found an abandoned ship in the international water in their Bering sea. They found chests full of gold and they thought they became millionaires but it was cursed and nobody could take them out of the ship. The little girl ghost who was hanged in his room in the closet by the gold stealing crew showed the only woman in the crew what happened in the ship. The crew members massacred the passengers and their leaders shot them all and the singer woman shot him and lastly the man who convinced them salvaging the ship killed her. He was a ghost looking for souls for the ship. But the woman in the crew managed to blow the ship up to liberate the souls and she was survived too. But the ghost was having the chests being taken to another ship while she's in the ambulance. The opening scene where the passengers on the dance floor butchered with the metal cord. Then the man was lured into the elevator shaft and their leader was drown in the aquarium and the other burnt during the explosion on their boat and the other was stuck and chopped up in pieces in the gears underwater while discharging the water out of the ship. And the last was shot by the soul keeper ghost guy. The killings were really impressive and there's something charming about 2000s movies.,Ghost Ship
75,PatrynXX,So so movie. house on haunted hill scarier.,5,26 April 2004,"(spoilers)I'd wanted to watch this film for a long time.  In July 2003 I had a bit of an argument with Walmarts online rentals, so it nixed the idea.  About 8 months later I got to watch it.  I thought it was okay.  The ship was amazingly well detailed.  ( much the same way in detail as master and commander)  But it was way too much like house on haunted hill.  Basically a boat version.  And Haunted Hill was far superior to this silly movie.On a whole though, I'd buy it, the only possible startling moment might be the nice little wire that gives us all a nice little gore fest.The 5 minute shorts they have on the dvd are pretty good.  And the music matches the movie.  However there's a bit of a confusion as to why the bad guy is bad.  Where's he taking the boat once the quota is filled?  Hell or Heaven.

77,mentalcritic,So this is how Karl Urban spent his days before being cast in a Lord Of The Rings film,6,27 November 2004,"Ghost Ship starts off in a very strange, almost bizarre fashion. With the cursive opening credits and the Love Boat-style opening dance, one can almost be fooled into thinking they are watching the wrong film. Then we suddenly get our first taste of what is to come with a rigging accident that, while about as improbable as the rest of the film, keeps the viewer at least vaguely interested while the setup is delivered.We are then introduced to a group of naval salvage workers, all of whom are played by a who's who of daytime television rejects or stars that haven't caught a break. As I mentioned in the summary, Karl Urban was about to enter public consciousness by playing what is arguably the most abused character in Peter Jackson's limp adaptation of The Lord Of The Rings. Julianna Margulies hasn't really appeared in anything of note since her ER days, so she pretty much plays a nearly-identical character. Same mannerisms, same speech, same everything bar the occupation. Gabriel Byrne does the best he can with a terribly underwritten role, while Alex Dimitriades and Karl Urban basically hope they can get another agent. You can almost sense Alex trying to send Karl a psychic message along the lines of ""don't let yourself get tied down to the Australian film industry... you'll never be free once you do"".As the salvage workers are kicking back after yet another successful voyage, a mysterious man offers them an assignment. The boat he talks them into salvaging for him turns out to be an Italian luxury cruise liner, the one we saw in the introduction, no less. As the crew attempt to salvage the ship and bring it home, they start hearing and seeing apparitions that get progressively more sinister as the film progresses. Chief among them is of a little girl, who eventually tells us what happened to most of the crew.In truth, nobody could have made this film anything more than b-level dross. The concept of a Marie Celeste ghost ship has been done so many times that even transporting the action to outer space has little effect. Another big problem is that the characters have too little distinction between each other. You have the token Americans, the token Antipodeans, and the token black man, all of whom tell us so much about who they are and what they do, but show us very little.The most telling moment in the film is when a tug explodes less than six feet away from the ocean liner, which has had a good forty years to rust, but said liner suffers no hull damage. The shrapnel and concussion individually would be enough to bend steel or puncture the outer structure. Having sent captures of this film to an old Italian girlfriend, she took one look at them and told me that she could have done a better job for half the price of whomever they paid to write such sign age. The gold bars that are light enough to throw are a personal favourite of Hollywood's, it would seem.I gave Ghost Ship a six out of ten. It is entertaining for what it is, but it stretches credulity so far that it can only really be seen as a comedy. I recommend it only as a time-waster.",Ghost Ship
78,Joxerlives,Surprisingly good film for being so cliché ridden,7,23 February 2014,"Watched this as I was a big Gay Byrne fan and I also liked Karl Urban from his Xena days. Really struck me as The House on Haunted Hill at sea and I wasn't far wrong but that isn't a bad thing. The poster very much reminds me of the old 80s slasher film Death Ship which I must confess I've never seen all the way through but whose splendidly lurid video cover both scared and intrigued me as a kid. Some quite superb set pieces, the bad taste classic of the dancers sliced to pieces by the breaking cable takes some beating. The little girl ghost is an incredible cliché of horror films but actually works pretty well here, it's a lovely concept that she couldn't be corrupted as the adult ghosts were because she died pure and innocent. The ending is lovely too, for such a dark film we have a happy conclusion with the souls of the dead finally released from their rusting prison and free to pass to the afterlife, whatever that may be, saving the heroine from a watery grave as they do so (very much like House on Haunted Hill 2). It would have been a nice touch if maybe the heroine continued to hold on to Sarah's hands as she ascended skywards only for her to tell her to let go and fall back into the sea, that she still has her mortal life to enjoy (and possibly some work to do to judge by the very final scene, the good fight goes on).A few bad points, Gay Byrne veers on the hammy with his old sea dog routine, he reminds me a little of Captain McCallister from The Simpsons. The old split the crew up and kill them one by one storyline is just too hackneyed for words. Surprisingly little gore though, the most shocking moments are the villains killing off the crew and passengers in 1962, especially Sarah's death which is hard to watch.All told, an entertaining horror and I'd certainly be up for watching the sequel.",Ghost Ship
79,Karl Self,"A little rotten, maybe, but real tasty",7,11 July 2009,"Although it shamelessly rips off classics such as Alien, The Shining and The Abyss (to name a few), and opens all floodgates to schlock, Ghost Ship manages to create a fascinating, eerie setting, reel the viewer in, and keep him there for a good time -- though not necessarily all the way to the credits. I like the way the movie switches from classic horror to postmodern gore over its course. It's an enjoyable, silly horror movie -- not one you should brag about with your art-house cineaste friends. If you like horror movies, you'll enjoy the ride.A few critics here on IMDb brought down this film's rating by awarding it one point. I would like to compliment those critics for apparently never actually having had to suffer a true single-pointer.",Ghost Ship
80,CharltonBoy,Not quite a sinking ship,6,29 March 2004,"Ghost Ship is by no means the worst horror i have ever seen in fact some parts of this film are quite entertaining, the problem seems to be some of the poor digital computer special affect that make this film look like a bit of a B Movie. Some of the affects are good expecially the opening scene where we see the crewe of the ship killed by a steel rope.The acting is ok and the characters are good so that when they are picked off one by one ,you care. There are a lot of question left unanswered though and in stages the scenes apear to have been put in any old order .

81,aesgaard41,Excellent Up To A Point,8,11 April 2003,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS: I'm a big fan of ghosts and haunted house movie, and Ghost Ship obviously continues the pattern created by Death Ship, Lost Voyage and Triangle. It actually runs like a very good ghost story setting up a bubbly Love Boat-like start as you think you've got the wrong movie and then turns exceptionally more ghoulish and gory as you realize that this is it. The suspense starts slowly as a stranger offers several salvagers the chance for a life time. Led by Gabriel Byrne and Julianna Margulies, the crew (featuring Karl Urban now outside Hercules: The Legendary Journeys) enter a very mysterious ship with a fine ghost story high-lighted by greed and avarice.  The characters are fun as the story begins vague, but the chills begin as the ship is shown from weird angles. The mood is now set as the ghosts use their weaknesses to scare them, but then, like Psycho in reverse, everything stops making sense and its no longer a ghost story, but some farce about catching souls ruins the movie to me as the ghost story aspect is tainted by devilry mishmash. Up till then, I'd say its a great movie, but the reality and the value of the movie is ruined by the twist which is a major disappointment. Up till then, the ghosts act like their real paranormal counterparts, one even using place memories to explain the past, but then the movie cops out by destroying the ship. The special effects merging models and live action on real sets is exquisite film-making at its best. Some inspiration from James Cameron's Titanic obviously went into this movie, but that one plot point sours the whole film.",Ghost Ship
82,movies2u,The Best and Scariest Movie That I Have Seen In A Great While.,9,29 December 2002,"(***Contains Spoilers***) Okay, just to say, Ghost Ship has one of the gruesomest opening sequences I've ever seen. It's really weird because as the opening credits are rolling, there is this happy music playing (the music from the song Francesca is singing), and the credits are this hot pink color and are in this fancy writing, and the next thing you know, people are being sliced up by a cable and their bodies are splitting and falling apart. I thought that that was pretty creative though, just to sort of trick you in a way. I almost thought I was at the wrong theater. Steve Beck has a unique way of giving a good feeling to his movies, but in a scary way. Like Thirteen Ghosts, with all those flashes and images of ghosts. But, yes, the opening sequence was very gruesome. The acting in this film was very good, with Julianna Margulies (TV's ER), Gabriel Byrne (Stigmata), and Desmond Harrington (who reminded me of and looks a lot like Edward Norton). Everyone there did a very well job. I think that after this, Julianna Margulies should move more into movies than television. One thing I really liked about this film was that it was very original. I mean, you don't see a haunted ocean liner movie much. It's usually the normal teen slasher movies, which some are okay, but they can get old. Mark Hanlon's story was brilliant though. Ghost Ship is probably the scariest movie of 1999-2002, besides The Ring which was also really scary. The only one thing that disappointed me a slight bit was the ending. At the ending, Jack (Desmond Harrington) is seen by Julianna Margulie's character when she is taken into the ambulence car. He is seen taking the gold onto another ship and then she screams and the credits roll??? I had wished the ending had just been that Maureen had gotten into the ambulence and was saved. But, they left it open for an optional sequel. I don't know if they will make one or they just wanted to let you know that evil can't die, which is portrayed in a lot of horror movies, such as in the Halloween series. All in all, I think that Ghost Ship was very well done and is extremely underrated. Any horror fan has to see this film. I give Ghost Ship a 9 out of 10.",Ghost Ship
83,deatman9,actually not bad.,6,19 October 2012,I actually didn't mind this movie as much as everyone else did. I thought it was actullay a pretty interesting idea and when I saw it when it first came out I was just a young kid I actually remember it freaking me out quite a bit. Its nice to see a ghost movie that still actullay has people die and a bit of gore.This movie is about a boat salvaging crew who go around the ocean looking for deserted boats then they sell the scrap. They come across one boat and get ready to tug it but then their tugboat breaks down. They are forced to board the ship where weird occurrences start to happen.This movie was enetertaining to say the least.

84,Shopaholic35,A perfectly watchable horror movie,7,31 January 2014,"Is there anything scarier than an abandoned ship full of ghosts...well probably but Ghost Ship is one of those horror movies that creates good suspense and unnerves you. I loved the sounds of the creaking hull and the eery drips and echoes. It uses it's surroundings to put you on edge and it has just the right amount of creepy theme music.Emily Browning shines as the little creepy girl in the movie in one of her earliest roles. Although the rest of the cast is lacking slightly. They are neither here nor there and feel more like props needed to propel the storyline. It's not that it is terrible acting but to me it feels like the movie/concept is wearing the actors not the other way around.In horror movie standards I enjoyed this movie and feel that is is a solid 7, above average and watchable but always room for improvement.",Ghost Ship
85,moviesleuth2,Good spooky ghost story,7,17 May 2010,"There is something about being in the middle of the ocean that seems so eerie. Possibly it's the fact that you're all alone out there. That kind of isolation is extremely unnerving, which makes it the perfect place to set a horror film.The crew of the salvage vessel ""Arctic Warrior,"" which consists of Murphy, the captain (Gabriel Byrne), Epps (Julianna Margulies), his right hand, Santos (Alex Dimitriades), and grunts Dodge (Ron Eldard), Greer (Isaiah Washington) and Munder (Karl Urban), have just succeeded in bringing a damaged oil rig back to port. As they are celebrating, they meet a young pilot named Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington), who provides them with an extraordinary opportunity: he has found a ship abandoned at sea. When they go to salvage it, it turns out to be a long lost Italian cruise liner, the Antonia Graza. But as they are trying to salvage it, they begin to realize that while they may have gotten on board, they may not be getting off.The performances are solid, but only two stand out: Margulies, and especially Harrington. Gabriel Byrne is too low key, and no one else is particularly memorable. Julianna Margulies is just about equal to Ripley, although we could have used more of her. The real surprise is Desmond Harrington, the pilot who tags along. He's a very nice, humble and caring guy, but he may not be telling everything that he knows.Director Steve Beck is adept at making the the ship a spooky place, but he is lacking in the scares and character department. There is a general sense of unease throughout the film, and while there are a few dead spots, the film is not only watchable, but actually enjoyable. That's more than can be said for many horror flicks (""Cujo"" comes to mind...).Do I recommend it? Well, if you're looking for the second coming of ""Halloween,"" you're going to be disappointed. But if you're looking for an intriguing and occasionally spooky ghost story, this should be right up your alley.",Ghost Ship
86,movieguy1021,Ghost Ship: 5/10,5,13 August 2004,"Finally, a breath of fresh air. There's been downpours of such ""horror"" films like Darkness Falls, They, and Secret Window, and it's nice to see a movie that sets up its characters in a chilling manner, slowly letting us get to like them, and then the horror turning on us in a subtle yet horrifying manner that gives us nightmares. The movie I'm talking about hasn't actually come out yet, and will probably never be released. I'll bet you thought I was talking about Ghost Ship, right? Ghost Ship is not a movie like that; in fact, it's the complete opposite of what horror films were in their peak in the 70s and 80s. That doesn't automatically mean it's a terrible film. It's just not great.A salvage crew at sea spots a 40 year old cruise ship out in the middle of nowhere. The b-list and z-list actors go aboard to search for whatever treasures may be aboard. But it's a ghost ship, so various horror-related things occur to them, as they die (you guessed it) one by one.The opening scene is a great one-setting the mood (which is quickly broken) and then some gore that isn't over-the-top. In fact, it's pretty funny, and I was amazed that they didn't go all out. But then it becomes typical new millennium horror fare. The characters are all underdeveloped, there's the bad-ass woman, there's the captain of some Western European descent, there's the two buffoons, there's the person trying to hit on the bad-ass woman, and there's the mole/traitor in the midst. You can combine those, if you want. The misadventures of these characters are strictly by-the-books, with some creepy surroundings and a few jump scares, but nothing really more. The special effects are generic, and everything comes down to some silly conclusion that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Wait, was I describing Ghost Ship, or was I describing every other horror movie that has come out recently?On the other hand, the movie has some cheesy fun to it. You wait to see what sort of improbable happenstances occur, with some sort of schadenfraude to it. You don't care about the characters, so you wait to see how they're going to be killed next. It's fun, for the most part, if you can leave all of the nautical mumbo jumbo behind and just go for an atmospheric if hardly scary ride through the ghost ship. Incidentally, the scariest part of the movie is actress Julianna Margulies's eyebrows. But, why not give Ghost Ship a try? It's enjoyable, and you might actually be scared by it (well, probably not).My ratings: 5/10Rated R for strong violence/gore, language and sexuality.",Ghost Ship

Stay tuned for the dopey ending where you get to see hundreds of souls leave the ship and ascend to heaven, as though some of them wouldn't go in the other direction.

You get hit with about 12 different twists in a short space of time and ultimately I felt completely lost. I am still not convinced I fully even understand the ending now.

94,nitzanhavoc,"Nothing terrible, nothing fantastic, great cast. Entertaining enough.",6,21 November 2020,"The first thing I can say about Ghost Ship is that I've seen it before around 10-15 years ago, and watching now sure didn't feel like experiencing an antique, or even a classic. Now, whether it means the film has aged well or the Horror genre simply hasn't developed is anyone's semantic choice. Fact is, just like many others of that 1995-2005 decade, the film still has story and Horror value for first timers today.The cast is quite impressive, as most of you would most probably notice quite a few familiar faces, be it from before the film of after it: Gabriel Byrne (from more films than I could presume to choose or summarize here) as Capt. Murphy; Karl Urban (from LOTR and a little MCU, and others of course) as Munder; and of course the hospital duo - Julianna Margulies (from ER) as Epps, and Isaiah Washington (from Grey's Anatomy) as first mate Greer. However, besides the ""all-star"" value and with the exception of Marguiles - nothing really worth mentioning.The plot and ultimate plot twist is quite smart, yet unoriginal, very fitting of the ""teen screams"" that came to power during those years (a sort of ""who done it"" with Horror elements, as ""suspects' keep dropping like flies and most of the audience has already guessed the ending half way through). This isn't to say the twist isn't at all surprising, even experienced viewers might miss out on the clues, but it isn't one of the great ones.All in all? A fun and relatively short Horror flick worthy of watching if you happen to come by it, but I wouldn't go searching for it or pay to watch it. Nothing remotely bad, but nothing really worthy of taking with you.",Ghost Ship

The acting was decent and the idea of being out there trying to drag this Nightmare Haunted Cruise Ship back to land and becoming trapped on it, makes for good ol fashion horror. I say watch it, even if you don't love it, I think most horror fans will at least consider it a decent 1 and done. Good FX too! :D.",Ghost Ship

The has an intense spooky atmosphere without losing the character development or any of the story. Pretty gruesome deaths scenes that are not for the squeamish of the faint of stomach. But my complaint is that they don't truly explain why? Why this monster is doing what he does? But the effects are great, the atmosphere is great, the story works, there are character issues and plot holes here and there. But for the most part it is a pretty cool movie that I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.

The title says it all, a crew enters a ghost ship and I assume you can already guess that there isn't that much chance of escaping. The plot (which of course I am not telling you) might be original but it also leaves you with the feeling that the director couldn't think of anything better. Ghost Ship never bores you as the special effects are far too splendid, but that is what is Ghost Ship all about, special effects....",Ghost Ship
99,Hunky Stud,"great entertainment movie, i really liked it.",8,24 January 2003,"I don't know why so many people left bad comments about this movie. I agree that there are some clichés in this movie. And some of the scenes are predictable.  I suppose for those who wrote bad comments, they probably watched it at home with their lights on. I watched it in a theater. And it was totally dark. Unlike some movies that take time for you to get into the mood, this movie attracted my attention immediately. For the first half of the movie, it was very scary. I didn't know what to expect, and I wished that I can fast-forward it, so I can see the ending without any more adrenaline rush. I don't like the gruesome scenes. It was ok to show the line cutting off people's bodies. There is no need to show further. Also I don't like the scene where the singer got killed. For the last half part, the scary part eases a little bit. That is good, because I want to get scared till the end. I suspected that the stranger might have something to do with the ship because of the way he looked.
Of course, it has flaws that are obvious. Overall, I think that this is a great entertainment movie. I truly enjoyed it.",Ghost Ship
100,Quicksand,Naughty Steve Beck,7,28 October 2002,"Given the absolute garbage that screenwriter John Pogue us usually attached to, I did the smart thing and ignored the film's credits BEFORE I got a Halloween-ish urge to see this flick.  Heck, ""Thirteen Ghosts"" was a decent scare/gore -fest, this one might be worth a look.After the unnecessarily graphic (and as disturbing as possible) opening scene (in which director Steve Beck tries to one-up Paul Anderson's ""Resident Evil""), the gore is surprisingly subdued, and we get a fast-paced, psychological action/spookfest, which is actually quite good.The salvage crew (led by Gabriel Byrne, determined to find a script worse than ""End of Days"") starts discovering little clues around the ship; what happened here?  Is there more to this job than meets the eye?  Some answers the audience is already privy to, some not.  It'll keep you guessing, if you're the type who likes to guess.  If you just like to see people getting sliced & diced, you're in for a disappointment.  After that opening scene, there's murder but no mayhem, until the film's final 10 minutes.  Even then, it's contrived.  The last death takes place for no reason; the screenwriter just needed a reason to off the last character.It's fun to watch Julianna Margulies as an action star, it's fun to watch Gabriel Byrne go slumming, it's fun to watch Isaiah Washington act.  And whereas the ""Gotcha!"" ending doesn't necessarily work, it's a lot better ending than ""Thirteen Ghosts"" could offer.Weak stomachs stay home, hard-core gore fans will find a 7/10",Ghost Ship
101,Miles-10,"half-good, half-@$$ed",5,22 August 2008,"(**Below Be Spoilers**) I must put spoilers in this comment because I want to talk about what is interesting about this movie rather than merely what is initially intriguing about it, although I will say that the opening scene promises so much more than the movie ultimately delivers. If a really smart script-doctor and director had gotten their hands on this, it could have been so much better. That being said, some of the ideas (possibly borrowed from other movies?) are rather fun. I will say that this movie bears a second viewing if you can stand it; there are some things that will make more sense the second time around, including a line by Jack Ferriman in the third (barroom) scene that made me laugh out loud on second viewing. The line could not be funny the first time around because I didn't yet know who Jack is.The first and last lines of the movie--although the last line is such a strained cliché--do bracket the horror in this horror film. The first person we see close up is Francesca, the entertainment on the cruise ship, and she has the first line as she sings ""Senza Fine"" an Italian ballad about never-ending (senza fine) love, and on one level, Francesca is in on--or thinks she is in on--the cruel reality of what is about to happen to her audience as she sings about ""this never-ending moment"" that will be their last moment alive. As the film cuts away from the horrible deaths of most of the passengers in the opening scene, we are not entirely certain whether this was an accident or a deliberate massacre, although there are clues suggesting that the latter might be the case. At the end of the picture, Maureen Epps cries ""No!""--the last line--because she realizes that the horror isn't over just because she has been rescued. Senza fine, indeed.Francesca and a gang of criminals seem to have been brought together to steal gold from the cruise ship. (It is left to the viewer to figure out or imagine how this was engineered since the cruise ship evidently did not have the gold at the outset of its voyage.) After the thieves eliminate all of the passengers, they begin to kill each other. Francesca is in on this treachery, but she is nevertheless surprised when she too is killed. I suspect she believes that the other thieves are doing it for money while she is doing it for love. What she does not realize is that the mastermind of this bloody business does not care about money or love because he is a demon whose job is to corrupt and then collect souls for a mass ferry ride to hell. Apparently he does not have enough souls on the ghost ship, so he ensnares more people, a few at a time, to add to his collection. As often is the case, the moral calculus is suggested but does not always work. For example, why is the young girl's soul trapped when she seems to have done nothing wrong of her own volition. If she committed suicide, this is not made clear; it rather seems she was murdered; however, Epps does seem to escape precisely because she won't fall for the demon's attempts to trick her into yielding to hatred or otherwise do something immoral.So here was an attempt at a poignant theme, and I like the basic idea, but it is handled rather tackily around the edges and spoiled. I agree with those who suggest that more details about the robbery, more development of Francesca's character and interaction with the thieves might have made a more interesting movie.",Ghost Ship
102,ApolloBoy109,Nicely created film steeped in the b-grade tradition,7,4 April 2003,"It has become clear to me now, that anyone born after 1980 is hyper critical about nearly every aspect of entertainment, as though at their tender ages -- they've seen it all. Somehow they are unable to just ""Go with the flow."" Too bad, really. No, Ghost Ship is not an A-List picture. Yes, it is entertaining on many levels. The direction keeps the story moving. The haunting score, and sets make the visuals work well. The acting is what you would expect from a horror film.The story itself follows the traditional haunted house formula, and the two or three twists are homage to the great schlock from the 50s and 60s, films I grew up on.

105,hasosch,Transgressing Two-Valued Logic,10,14 December 2007,"Common sources of older horror movies were basically fairy tales, legends and motives from mythology. But since the laws of quantitative conservation have been established in physics by Maxwell, Planck, Einstein and others, pathologies started to emerge from a science concept that is strictly based on two-valued Aristotelian logic which therefore led itself ad absurdum. For example, in High Energy Physics, the difference between observer and observed item and thus between subject and object are abolished, and according to Heisenberg it is impossible to formulate an utterance about the world that is non-paradoxical because the person who formulates it is part of the world to be described by this utterance.Since a few decades, we have qualitative mathematics which is based on a multi-valued logic that transgresses this border between subject and object and thus bridges the abyss between the Here and the Beyond. Since the question what will be after Death is bothering humankind since ever, it seems quite natural to use as a reservoir for much creepier forms of horror the gigantic possibilities implied by physics, mathematics and semiotics that are no longer based on the fundamental logical laws of our thinking, namely the law of the excluded middle, the law of identity and the law of non-contradiction. American philosopher Oliver Reiser once wrote that as soon as these three laws of our thinking will fall, then the relativity theories will no longer look more than like ""shame battles"".""Ghost Ship"" is a marvelous further development of Ghost Trains, but with the possibilities of modern film technics that cannot be applied in the fairground. Whenever I have a change to teach about ""Poly-Contextural Theory"" (established in the famous ""Biological Computer Laboratory"" at the University of Illinois since the 50ies), I use, after the ""Ghost Ship"" was released in 2002, this film for illustration. As a matter of fact, I have not found any other movie or novel which has all the clue elements of Poly-Contextural Theory in it: the elimination of the border between subject and object, representation (sign) and presentation (object), Ego and Thou, Here and Beyond; the appearance of rests of reflexion (that have to be banned into mythologies because they do not fit into the Procrustes-bed of our two-valued thinking); the elimination of the individuality of persons and thus enabling doubling or multiplying of personality and ""chiastic"" relations between different persons (who therefore ""merge"" into one another), allowance of anti-parallel time arrows (forth and back at the same time) and much more. Of course, this movie was not intended to be an application of one of the most abstract theories of modern science, but watching this movie we should not forget that the great anticipator of Poly-Contextural Theory, Lewis Carroll (the logician and mathematician Charles L. Dodgson) has wrapped his world-changing ideas into children's' books. Therefore, the ""Ghost Ship"" can simply be watched for the sake of entertainment, but this, however, does not exclude to recognize it perhaps as the first horror movie which makes consistently and thoroughly use of motives of fear which are implied by confrontation of our common mono-contextural with the still unknown poly-contextural world that is based on the loss of the fundamentals of our whole thinking. Only when we will recognize that the mono-contextural world is a part of the poly-contextural world, we will find consolation.",Ghost Ship
106,tributarystu,"All that ""Event Horizon"" achieved to avoid",4,20 May 2003,"I might say I was lucky to have seen Event Horizon one month before Ghost Ship. It gave me a clear idea from where this movie got its inspiration. Not to mention a classic like ""The Shining"". I think I'm going to try to do a review without spoilers. Be warned though, that probably I might ""spoil"" some of this totally ""unexpected"" and ""original"" story.Stories about ghost ships can be dated for a long, long time. There have been movies about them and there most probably will be. It's the first thing that would have to make you reconsider the potential of the genre before viewing this movie. The second thing is the intro. I've thought a bit about it and I just can't interpret it in any other way, but a sample of the movie's bad taste: the pink and so romantic looking credits. I am just to dazzled to comment on this disgusting choice of colors. It's bad taste, because it can't possibly be a joke. And if it is, it's...so bad!Still, early after this intro, we get the so called best part of the movie. Also the goriest. I've read that people were outraged by the way ""things"" looked in Event Horizon. Well, they're absolutely decent compared to this one. Event Horizon did not exaggerate in such a manner that it disgusted you (eh, or maybe it did, but that's not the point). This here thing exceeded the boundaries of common sense. However, the scene is unexpected (without any profound motivation, if I may add) and will send some chills down some spines. Inhuman but unexpected. I laugh when I think that people said that even ""The Pianist"" was violent (beside the fact that it's a war film, of course). Compared to this, that was something like...The Jungle Book.BUT! there was no originality in it. There's no difference between lasers in Resident Evil (or The Cube) or this. There just isn't. Sorry, no can give points. The action from here on is plain boring, totally not scary, sometimes even pathetic.Actors will be actors, but without a decent script, they're as impotent as a castrated donkey. No comment.As anyone who reads this humble review will have noticed, I am totally for ""Event Horizon"", which wasn't a perfect movie, not by far, but it was a far better horror movie than this one. Story may be very similar, but the Sci-Fi bit just makes the difference for me. A ship in space or a ship on the water...it's just not the same thing.Ghost Ship is a total waste of time. The only nice effect is the one on the small girl. The difference between living and dead. Nice make-up. The only problem is, it seems that people who liked Event Horizon didn't like this one. And again vice-versa. Might just be a coincidence around here, but might also be a fact. I'd choose to see Event Horizon any time. This gets a 3.5/10",Ghost Ship
107,buzznzipp1995,Love Lost Boat,6,13 January 2007,"This story, with a luxury cruise liner, that has been, floating out in the Behring Sea, since well, 1962 is eerie in itself, this ship is so large and so grandly made that it would decimate practically anything in it's wayward path, at very least. But when it comes to finding this lost at sea vessel, this salvage crew is in for a major surprise. The Antonio Graza, is a whale of a large ship. Bigger than most, it was made to cross the waters, with ease. Watching this story work it's way to the point of searching for the ship, to me was an excellent visual, when the scope that Captain Murphy (Byrne) is using to track her, sort of 'skips' out then comes back on, and this extremely large vessel, is right in front of them, and they scramble to go into reverse, but only to run right into her! That ship was so ominous and dark, it truly put a start into me, the hairs on my neck stood up, when they found her. The ship that had run aground, had rust, and the paint had been corroded for decades. The vessel was well aged at sea, in the sun and salt air with the rains and waves etc, the plates on the deck of the ship, were, not all safe to walk across, adding a larger element of danger in just moving around on board. The cast was a good cast and the story is intriguing, it's an eerie thought to have a ship this size just floating aimlessly in the oceans for 40 years. The history on that ship alone would make it an 'A&E' spectacular. Allbeit for me on any level it is the things that can happened or already have that are scary not like a monster with metal claws coming out of the wall...but something that can actually get to you...in real time. The truth is stranger that fiction. What a truly interesting set-up, although the script was kinda weak, in sections, could have used some help.

121,Zombified_660,A slick and enjoyable horror thriller.,8,24 August 2005,"I'll confess to being a little cynical about Ghost Ship. The fairly cheesy trailer and a raft(pun unintended) of critics taking potshots at it staved me off watching it until recently. Truth of the matter is Ghost Ship is a quality horror thriller. Granted, it's more spooky than scary, and with the exception of a few juicy jumps, there's not a whole lot of shocks, but it's fun, slickly executed and doesn't disappear up it's own backside like a lot of other cinematic release horror movies.The ship setting makes for a cool haunted-house vibe, giving the movie the much needed tension most modern horror movies are devoid of, and many of the set pieces are truly inventive. Dark Castle have impressed me both times I've watched one of their movies, the other being House of Wax, and they won't disappoint you. As a bonus, this movie, like House of Wax is loaded with sweet gore and SFX as well. Just check out that opening dismemberment scene. Nice.The actors are solid, the script is good, and the direction is pretty tight.

122,mlevans,Deserves very high marks,8,25 April 2003,"For someone who loves a good horror movie, loves historic mysteries (real or invented) and loves ships/shipwrecks, `Ghost Ship' was one film I had to see. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was stunned to see that it has such a low voting average. I cannot account for this-especially that women seem to rate it higher than men, despite a fairly high gore count.The film depicts a veteran salvage crew that gets pulled into a job that sounds too good to be true-and IS. A mysterious derelict ship has been sighted and photographed in the Bering Straight. After locating it, they discover it to be the legendary missing Italian liner Antonia Graza, which disappeared mysteriously May 16, 1962. When they discover boxes of gold bars, it REALLY seems too good to be truethen people start to die. I won't get into the plot and throw in a bunch of spoilers. One can imagine basically what would happen on a ghost ship that really IS a ghost ship, such as this one. Director Steve Beck and writer Mark Hanlon aren't really breaking any entirely new ground here. Yet Ghost Ship brings home the bacon with an excellent evening of chills and spills and a little pathos to boot.Julianna Margulies and Gabriel Byrne lead the family-like salvage crew. Said by another crew member to be like father and daughter, Murphy (Byrne) and Epps (Marguiles) are both rivoting in their roles. The small ensemble cast is great from top to bottom, with Ron Eldard, Karl Urban, Isaiah Washington and Alex Dimitriades as the crew members. Desmond Harrington plays Ferriman, a pilot who approaches the salvagers with photos of the mystery ship and insists on going with them to check out the booty.QUASI-SPOILERS AHEADEmily Browning adds pathos and empathy as the ghost of a young girl named Katie, who had been traveling alone to meet her parents when the Antonia Graza met its fate. Frencesca Rettondini also excels as the hot Italian singer and ghost of same. Robert Ruggeiro also makes an intriguing captain and ghost. I loved the attention to detail, as well. I was not surprised to check `trivia' and see that the design of the Antonia Graza was based on the legendary Andrea Dorea. Murphy takes time to point out that Italian liners of the era couldn't match English liners for speed and therefore relied on the beauty and elegance of the ship itself and the level of luxury on board, to survive in the North Atlantic liner trade.I could find a few nits to pick. I have trouble believing that Murphy was the only one of this experienced salvage crew who had ever heard of the Mary Celeste! And then HE erroneously states that its crew disappeared during the Civil War; it was actually 1872. (Hey, give me a break, I'm a grad history student and a date nerd, OK?) I also question the mass death scene on the liner. It seems unlikely to me that all these people would stand still for some 20-30 seconds after being sliced in half by a cable, before reacting. It reminds me of Wile E. Coyote and other cartoon characters who suddenly realize the ground has fallen away from beneath them and hang animated for several seconds before falling. Then again, never having actually SEEN someone get sliced in half with a taut cable, I cannot really say that it was NOT accurate.Overall, this is a very classy, well-made horror film. It has some gore, to be sure, but it doesn't rely on that to scare one. Some good Gothic horror touches are present and the acting is first rate. This is definitely the best horror movie I've seen in the past few years.",Ghost Ship
123,clydestuff,"""Second half of this movie sinks this haunted ship story""",4,13 April 2003,"For the first half of Ghost Ship, we are treated to an old fashioned haunted house movie done aboard an abandoned luxury liner.  Unfortunately, about midway through the picture, it begins to sink faster than a rowboat shot with holes.The opening scene, from 1962,  is truly orginal. I won't tell you what happens though, as you might as well savor one of the few good things this movie has to offer.  Flash forward to the present time, where a salvage crew headed by Gabriel Byrne, goes looking for the ship on a tip.  As you might expect, once on board, some really creepy things begin happening, and the movie does a good job of building suspense with a truly creepy atmosphere, things that go bump in the night, and ghostly apparitions that may or may not be there.  Unfortunately for us the whole schmiel quickly falls apart, as the salvage crew gets a strong case of the irrationals and stupids.  The movie also starts to fall back on old tiresome cliches such as two of the crew members are eating, the food changes into maggots, a scene I've viewed in so many movies lately, it's more than worn itself out.
As if this wasn't bad enough, in the last twenty minutes we begin to get an explanation of all the goings on, that makes so little sense that it's hardly an explanation at all.  Top all this off with the now obligatory sequel setting ending, and you can rest this ship at the bottom of the sea.",Ghost Ship

The gratuitous violence in the opening scene of this movie is not only shocking, but also very twisted. How the censor board let it through is baffling (bribes perhaps?!) - and yet they tone down the violence in so many other movies, ones that are less sickening than this.Watch the opening scene if you must - for sure curiosity value (be warned though faint hearted people; it will destroy you!) alone - but don't bother with the rest.",Ghost Ship

130,jangu,Entertaining and boring in about equal measures,5,16 April 2003,"This movie starts with a bang! The titles and music suggests a Esther Williams-musical extravaganza to come. We see a woman in a slinky red dress singing a tender tune in (rather bad) italian while a lot of dressed-up people dance away on the deck of a ocean liner. It's all very pleasant but the closeups of a steel cable disturbs the picture of tranquility. Then, suddenly, the scene is transformed into a bloodbath and it's quite well-done and rather disgusting. This sequence and a flashback later in the movie are the best scenes. As soon as the salvage crew get on board, they spend a lot of time walking about in different directions, seeing and hearing things. It is quite atmospheric for a while and the sets are magnificent, but apart from some gory death scenes nothing really interesting happens. Between some suspense there is quite a lot of tedium and the scares are not that many. However, it is all very capably put together and a vast improvement from Steve Beck's previous ""opus"", Thirteen ghosts.

What they don't know is that the ship is haunted and one by one the crew members lose their lives.The story starts in great fashion with a shocking massacre on deck but when the crew finally meet the ghosts (and when they start explaining things) it all goes down. What a pity. I liked the movie sets and actors in this story. Some scenes even reminded me of Kubrick's The Shining - and that's a compliment.About two minutes from the end you think that you have been watching a okay but not classic ghost story but unfortunately the last surprise spoils the whole film.

133,boondocksaint20,Surprisingly...pretty good!,8,30 May 2003,"I am a big fan of horror films...and over the past ten years, there really haven't been that many good horror films out.  The only two that really stand out are Final Destination (at least the first half of it) and The Ring, for their unique and almost terrifying takes on horror.
I was tempted to see this one when it came out, because I knew though it would have a crappy plot, bad acting and whatnot, it would deliver the goods...satisfy that guilty pleasure that drives us all to watch these movies.  But after the last two Dark Castle movies, House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts, I decided to pass on this one.  I believe Dark Castle entertainment, a company founded by some of the best producers in the business to solely remake classic Castle films is a great idea...their main problem though, with their first two movies was not the horror element (I, at least found both to be pretty scary when watching it at home in the dark), but succumbing to absolutely horrible plots and even worse scripts and acting...though they had done a marvelous job at special effects and using more makeup, which is almost always better than CGI, the films failed in quality because of the previous mentioned.  They weren't the types of movies with horrible plots and acting that you can enjoy by making fun of like the Friday the 13th films, but these films failed b\c they took themselves so seriously, and ended up annoying everyone with the horrible actors (yes, I am talking about you, Matthew Lillard).  I had heard, though, from several friends that they thought Ghost Ship would absolutely suck, but ended up enjoying it, surprisingly so.  Since I trust word of mouth more than critics, I decided to give this one a try.This movie is surprisingly well done.  I have read some people's reviews on this movie, and I can say that it is not for everyone's tastes.  It boasts, like the other Dark Castle films, a very gory, very realistic prologue that starts the show...except this was one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen.  When you see the 'fake' credits and uplifting music at the beginning, you just know something horrible is about to happen, and in this case, the stronger the fake out, the more horrifying the actual 'payoff'. Personally, after the shock wore off, I thought the beginning was very well done and ultimately one of the most gruesome scenes I have ever seen...but it is definitely not for everyone, and should be avoided by those who have weak stomachs.The rest of the movie is really nothing new, but it is played out pretty well.  The acting by all is actually pretty good, especially for a horror film.  Though you know that this is going to be another outing of 'And Then There Were None', it's hard to resist who will get it when and how.  The movie itself is not the scariest movie ever, but it does deliver a great mood, a creepy atmosphere, and an overall feeling of dread which goes well with the story.  Great performances by Gabriel Byrne (who I was surprised to see in a movie like this), Ron Eldard, and the little girl who played the lost, helpful spirit on the boat, one of the best child actors I have seen in some time.Overall, I recommend Ghost Ship.  Finally, Hollywood made a decent horror film.  Sure, this isn't the best film ever made, doesn't have the most original plot or whatnot, but for what it is, it is pretty darn good.  I give it 7.5/10 stars.",Ghost Ship
134,walken_on_sunshine,The Doc's Review Ghost Ship,7,9 November 2006,"Ghost Ship starts off very beautiful the music is soft,the credits are flowery and pretty. There are bubbles and the film has a very happy light feel. People are having a good time at a posh party on the top of the ship.The next few minutes are the goriest, most shocking, horrific,bloody scenes put in a horror movie in a long long time, and the first five minutes of this film will have you disturbed,shaken,and in awe. If this first scene doesn't have you in fear and creeped right out, then just wait, there's more. Look for people eating maggots,rats everywhere, people getting slashed and sliced up as well as explosions and a good creepy story with twists and turns that are while predictable are brilliant. Unfortunately, the whole film doesn't quite live up to the first five minutes, but it does display a very eerie atmosphere and a $hitload of scenes that will make you cringe and jump out of your seat.The film has a very Gothic feel as well which kind of gives it a creepy overtone as well something that put me right in the mood for a scary movie.Overall Ghost Ship is a film that redefines terror.",Ghost Ship
135,knsevy,"Not a masterpiece, but good",6,28 November 2003,"***I'M COVERING MYSELF BY SAYING 'SPOILERS', THOUGH I'M NOT SURE THERE'LL BE ANY***I thought this was a good concept for a horror movie, and I really didn't think the gore was all that bad. My scale for gore depends on how realistic and painful the depiction is, and this movie wasn't really that bad. Since I'm a fan of realistic physics, the infamous cable scene at the beginning of the movie didn't phase me; I just thought it was laughable.Beyond that silliness, I liked the movie. Granted, it had the 'Hollywood rainbow' in the cast, i.e. on of every ethnic group, but I thought they played well. I didn't think Santos was a 'hispanic stereotype' as one reviewer put it. All I noticed was that he spoke with a hispanic accent - well, I guess that makes me wrong, since speaking with a hispanic accent IS a stereotype for a hispanic character.In my opinion, the concept is very good, and it's carried off acceptably. They explain enough for you to understand WHY things are happening, but they don't go any farther. If anything, the movie did explain too much about the reason for this cursed ship's existence. Whether or not the gore in this movie is too graphic for a viewer is going to depend on personal opinion. Myself, I don't get upset at graphic gore if it's not a long, extracted, torturous scene. The biggest gore scenes in this movie happen very fast, but they are rather graphic. I hope my description will help viewers make the choice, for themselves. I consider myself to have a weak stomach, but this movie didn't upset it.The overall concept of the ship, i.e. the reason why people die there is a good one, in my opinion.  There are a few small continuity gaps, but overall, the movie laid down a consistent vision. I didn't think the gore was excessive - it could have been a LOT worse in the 'cable' scene - and I didn't think it detracted from the overall story.On the whole, I recommend this film. I think it's reasonably stylish with a decent concept.",Ghost Ship
136,Caz1964,Entertaining horror,8,13 December 2006,"Ghost ship is a fairly average horror film I've seen better and I've seen a lot worse. The most gory part of the film is at the beginning and its quite unexpected and you have the option of continuing to watch or not,but for some reason you feel immediately involved in the film and need to keep watching. As a ghost film it doesn't have many surprises and it does have a plot you can spot a mile off and there are certain other flaws,such as the ship has been sunk for 40 years and yet all the door handles are in perfect condition and working order.And there's also a scene where actress Julianna Margulies walks across the floor in one of the main rooms and the carpet is in perfect condition,i would have thought that after 40 years below the sea,the door handles would be rusty and any carpet would have turned to mush. Oh well i could be wrong.

Not much of a surprise here, but this film isn't concerned with originality.  Like many of the B horror flicks of the 70's and 80's, this one has only two goals: to disgust and horrify the audience.  The first is fairly well done.  The opening scene is particular is commendable for it's creativity and general yuckiness that I found strangely reminiscent of _Saving Private Ryan_.  The film does not scare so much, however.  The main reason for this is that there is only a wisp of character development and even less of a story, meaning there's no real chance for the audience to empathize with any of the characters.Thusly, acting was not really required for this film, with the possible exception of Marguiles and the little girl, who are fine.  It's more of a special effects knee jerk of the genre against directors like M. Night who are trying to make it some sort of art form.  It's just horror, folks.So, support it if you're a genre fan.

Then we switch to the 'present day' where things slow down.'The best damn salvage crew in the business' is led by Captain Sean Murphy (an Irishman convincingly played by Gabriel Byrne) and consists of Maureen Epps (the lovely Julianna Margulies), Dodge (Ron Eldard), Munder (Karl Urban), Greer (Isaiah Washington), and Santos (Alex Dimitriades). We get to know them well over the next few days.A Canadian Air Force Pilot, Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington) approaches them with pictures of an ocean liner which he spotted and convinces the crew to take a look at the ship, and take him with them. They discover that the ship is holed and sinking. They have three days to repair it and tow it.However, once on the ship strange things happen. Munder falls through a floor, Epps sees the ghost of a little girl (Emily Browning), Greer is seduced by the voice of the dead (and dead gorgeous) Italian singer (Francesca Rettondini).Steve Beck does a superb job as Director in keeping the suspense up. What is going to be behind the next door? Behind one door is millions of dollars worth of gold! After the crew's own boat mysteriously explodes, they are left to fend for themselves on the cruise ship as the spooky events escalate. And the plot weaves its way towards its conclusion.The movie is genuinely horrific with great special effects. The actors are all good. Why is this rated so low?

Then it shows this really nice fancy party, with people dancing and looking happy, it then shows Emily browning ( Series of unfortunate events) when she was a little girl dancing with captain, all the while a very attractive singer named Francesca is singing an Italian song called Senza Fine, despite never watching this movie as a kid, this song and opening sequence feels very nostalgic and blissful. Of course without much warning a metal wire somehow breaks and cuts everyone on the dance floor into pieces, leading to a very gory shot. The movie then skips to a couple of years later to a salvaging crew, in the middle of a great action sequence, which does cause a mood whiplash, but after the last scene it is welcomed. The crew then return to port and meet a mysterious pilot who claims to have found the missing Italian liner, feeling a major payday they head out to find it. ONce they find it, the atmosphere hits you like a ton of bricks, the outside of ship looks creepy enough, they all respect the danger an old ship, a few entertaining ghost stories are told about. And the the haunting begins, well more like only 3 ghosts, 2 0f them being the little girl and captain who want to help the crew, the other is Francesca, who has some good moments that add to the atmosphere, but is never portrayed as scary, however some special effects do cause a few jump scares, and when members of the crew start dying the tension does increase. And then the second half begins, its not that its bad, but the rest crew find out that they've been lured by the devils advocate and that hes collecting souls on the ship, but needed someone to fix it, that's cool, but the way it was executed was kind of lame, when the history of the ship and the fate of the passengers is revealed, its all moving at a fast pace, with techno music, showing the crew killed everyone so they could keep all the cursed gold for themselves, and then their all killed, this was a cool sequence at first, if they slowed it down, explained more, and perhaps better music this could have been great, but instead it left me feeling kind of sick and disappointed. The climatic battle between the bad guy and Julianna Margulies (the good wife and ER), it felt very anti-climatic, but realistically i would have just blown up the boat too. Despite most of the second half being clunky, i was in awe, when all the trapped souls of the passengers are swimming from the sinking ships, turn into a spiral of light around the ship, and then enter into heaven, it made feel very good and forget most of what i hated in the second half, of course i got a mood whiplash when the survivor finds out the bad guy survived with the cursed gold and is just going to start the whole thing all over again. The movie is not scary, but i will admit suspenseful, the dialogue could have been better, the crew weren't too memorable, but like the marines from Aliens, they were likable, in fact a young Karl Urban was in this movie ( Dredd ).

Do NOT miss the opening scene (over-the-top clever gore), and pay attention to the dialogue in the last half or the ending will mystify you.The dialogue and character development are limited, as others point out, but so what? This is horror/supernatural/action material and we aren't expecting Shakespearean writing.  Nor do we give a rat's ass about getting involved with characters who are getting dead at a rapid rate. If you want to connect emotionally with the characters, go rent some faggy Swedish art film and let the rest of us enjoy the blood, bullets and evil demons. For what it's supposed to be, they did good.My only real criticism is that the water temperatures of the Bering Strait (in the Arctic) are barely above freezing, yet these people are wandering about in light clothing, swimming around, wading around in thigh-high Arctic salt water as if were the South Pacific (which is exactly where it was filmed) instead of going into hypothermia within minutes. In one case, someone clings to a piece of floating debris overnight and into the next day. It could easily have been covered by having someone remark early on how unnaturally warm the surrounding water had become (some left-handed symbolic reference to Hell, perhaps) just to give us a reason NOT to be annoyed with the incongruence.

I am now a fully fledged grown mature 35 year old and seeing it through those aged eyes is a whole different thought process.
I just couldn't believe the screenplay which at times had me left smiling, smiling at the horror of cruel writing.
Finding a positive within a bit so good film is hard to do.
It's not the worse film I've seen but it's not good either.
I think watching it back when I was 18 it allowed for me to somewhat have guilty pleasures like a bad song that you can't help but sing along too.
Watch Ghost Ship with a care free attitude and let it unfold before your eyes.

But this movie is not just a bunch of blood. Unlike many other horror movies the story is good. It kept my attention threw the entire movie. The best thing about the movie is the story gets going pretty fast, No waiting around for a in depth overview of every person in the story, you find out who they are and then it gets interesting. The effects are pretty good and there is a creepy factor to the entire movie. Every thing looked very real like if there really was a ghost ship out in the Atlantic Ocean.

I loved Thir13en Ghosts, and I loved House on Haunted Hill, but I didn't even LIKE Ghost Ship. Ghost Ship was highly predictable, horribly clichéd, and a cheap clone of Event Horizon (which was an excellent movie, by the way). The little girl who was SUPPOSED to be eerie wasn't eerie at all. In fact, I was beginning to wonder whether or not she was a ghost. The movie itself failed at being scary. I don't usually hate horror movies for not being scary (most fail at scaring me anyway), but the thrills were extremely mild. The suspense factor isn't where it should be.Then there are the characters. There's one character whose death is certain 20 minutes before it happens, and you can even accurately guess how he's going to die. The only scene I really liked in Ghost Ship was the beginning sequence, which happened to be a VERY good introduction and explanation to why the ship was haunted. However, the rest of the movie dragged on.I thought this movie would be similar to Event Horizon. It was TOO similar. The movies have plots that are almost identical. Ghost Ship changed a couple of things around, but I have my suspicions. If you want to see the same story done a thousand times better, see Event Horizon. Ghost Ship was MST3K worthy. 3/10.",Ghost Ship

I was surprised that the passengers did not see that trip wire, it reminded me just how cheese is sliced! If I was there, I would of left this grave yard alone. I enjoy this film, but it is best viewed with the lights on! or just dimmed. The best thing would of been just to blow the ship up and leave. what surprised me is at the end when the dead people came out of the new ship. there was a lot of gold blocks on that ship, I estimated around 2 million or more.For gore and special effects I'm awarding this film 10/10 I got this DVD at my local supermarket for £2.99 money well spent I'd say.",Ghost Ship

I love the bit where they literally 'bump' into the old liner. The random jumping into icy waters etc is all a bit daft, but then it's one of those movies where you have to leave common sense behind and just enjoy.It's all in all a poor man's Shining, set on a rusty old hulk of a liner rather than a hotel, but just enough thrills, spills and scares to past muster.",Ghost Ship

They go to check it out and discover the ship hasn't spent 40 years on the ocean ALONE... There are interesting hints as to what might have happened in 1962 when the ship seemingly vanished from the face of the ocean (like bullet holes in the swimming pool), but it isn't until the salvage crew are stranded on the liner that truly bad stuff starts to happen.When I saw the ads for this movie, they looked a LOT like the movie ""Death Ship"", which is right near the top of my most favorite truly crummy horror movies. Between DS and ""Triangle"", ""Lost Voyage"" and even ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""Dead Calm"", I figured they wouldn't come up with anything new to put on a boat.

165,jturnbull-398-395794,Surprisingly Good,8,4 August 2012,"I watched this film on TV last night more out of curiosity than interest and found it to be, remarkably, far better than its rating, but that might be because despite its shock/horror it is a very deep and quite intellectual film that demands reflection and analysis.Treat at a superficial level and it might be just a run of the mill gore-fest but it is much more than that, and the acting is uniformly very good.The film draws heavily (IMHO) from Alien, The Shining, and possibly even Meet Joe Black. In Alien we have a bunch of blue collar workers with one smart girl (Ripley); here we have Epps. In The Shining we have the Grady girls, here we have Katie. In Joe Black we have the notion of a supernatural presence (Death) taking convincing human form;here we have Ferriman. Even his persona is a clever device. In Greek mythology Charon was the ferryman who transported souls from this world to the next over the River Styx. This is a good example that this movie does work at quite an intellectual level.While there are technical plot holes in this movie, hey its a horror/thriller and you need to suspend elements of reality and belief.I won't dwell on the plot which others have covered, but clearly Ferriman is a demonic agent of the Devil; sort of a commodity trader in human souls. He has found greed (one of the seven deadly sins) as stock in trade, along with lust, and killing. He has used the Ghost Ship multiple times to recruit vulnerable souls. He can cloak it from radar and visibility but not control its drifting. It is sinking and he needs it fixed, and if he can achieve that and get some souls of sinners in the process even better.But to gain a soul he needs them to sin. 'Souls without sin can't be marked'. But the ship is sunk and he needs to start again, so why not stick to a winning formula. A new ship. Whether the gold is real or not is conjecture and it is not the original crew that takes it on board the new ship. They have gone to hell and he needs live bodies to execute his plan and in turn to give him some new souls.While it is not entirely original I think it ranks well against The Shining as a thought provoking movie, and miles ahead of the rubbish that is Prometheous.Rcommended if you are into the genre and have a bit of grey matter.",Ghost Ship
166,kmberger,Not worth the trouble.,3,4 November 2002,"'Ghost Ship' is basically a haunted house story set at sea.  A crew of a salvage ship headed by the gruff Murphy (Gabriel Byrne) heads into the Bering Strait to find a long-lost ocean liner, the Antonio Graza, missing for the past forty years.  Of course, once they board, they find that the ship holds the ghosts of that ill-fated voyage, and their own salvage operation becomes secondary to escaping the ship alive.Pretty standard fare here, at least on the surface.  Given these parameters (stranded ship, a handful of explorers, ghosts aplenty), you'd think a halfway decent horror movie could come out of it - generating at least a few scares.  You'd be wrong.  'Ghost Ship' is even less than a by-the-numbers scare flick, because it tries far too hard to be different.  Instead of original, however, it ends up convoluted, confusing, and altogether flat. 
Director Steve Beck (Thirteen Ghosts) helms a very weak and disjointed script by Mark Hanlon that papers over every character's backstory and motivation (including the ghosts) to provide the gore and mayhem that it thinks works as scary suspense.  A key misfire:  The movie opens by showing the audience the gory fates of many of the ship's original passengers - sparing nothing in severed limbs and gallons of blood.  That's a cringe-inducing effect, not a scare-inducing one.  Squeamish viewers will be turned off immediately, and any sense of foreboding (what DID happen to all those passengers?) is immediately sacrificed for the instant gratification. 
This kind of thing happens all the time - there's almost no feeling of dread or suspense of any kind.  When things do happen, they're usually quick and bloody.  That can work in a slasher flick, but in a ghost story, you usually expect a little more sophistication.  One hint as to what might have been is a nicely filmed sequence in the middle of the film, where Greer (Isaiah Washington) walks into the old ballroom, only to watch it rebuild itself back into 1962, complete with sultry torch singer.  A great shot, the best in the film, that is of course mishandled and wasted for shock value.  Ah well.The salvage team members are mostly mercenaries, driven by greed when they find a cache of gold in the hold of the ship.  You really don't care much for any of these folks, though Epps (Julianna Margulies) is given some sympathy by being the de facto heroine.  Of course, when the only personal detail you're given about her is her first name (unlike everyone else, who is only referred to by last names) - that's a bit of a reach.All in all, it's a needless film, and one that is mishandled and cheapened from the get-go.  Skip this one, and go see something really scary, like 'The Ring', instead.",Ghost Ship

It starts off misleading you into think it's going to be harmless fun.... until everyone dancing gets sliced in half by a cable. From then on, it's a generic ghost/slasher movie with characters you only kind of care about and the twist with Ferriman honestly comes as no surprise.Also, the massacre scene towards the end is completely ruined by the idiotic choice to have a RAP SONG playing over it instead of actual scary haunting music. That choice of music over that scene actually made me angry.Plus, the ending pretty much made the whole film moot; the haunted ship is blown up, all the souls trapped aboard are freed, which by the way is beautiful..... until we see the gold as well as Ferriman boarding the ocean liner that rescued our main character, thus starting the whole process all over again. If the movie had just ended with Epps being loaded into the ambulance or even when the ocean liner rescues her, if the movie had just cut to black after we get that shot of the liner, that would've been a better ending. Sudden, but satisfying; the souls of everyone who had died onboard the Grazia would be free and Ferriman would be in Hell getting... well, Hell from his boss.There is a movie with a similar title and plot from 1980 called Death Ship.

169,steve-862,Truly Awful,2,3 April 2005,"Having now been converted to Eastern horror I suppose I was foolish to watch this film, expecting to enjoy it. I have realised for some time now that Hollywood horror is about as imaginative and scary as an episode of Scooby-Doo, not one of the better episodes either. This film started with a terrible idea, used bad script and direction to develop an utterly scare-less atmosphere and then insulted my intelligence by connecting every single aspect of the story, giving me absolute reasons for everything. I've seldom felt like my time was wasted watching a film because I love films and enjoy a variety of different genres but particularly horror. This was one such time when I think that 90 minutes of my life have been wasted and I feel aggrieved that I can do nothing to get those 90 minutes back.I'm actually writing this review wasting further minutes of my life but as I'm ranting I consider this therapy. If you do like a ship based ghost story I would recommend 'Deathship', from which I imagine this film was loosely based. 'Deathship' however is a superior film in every way to this and is worth 90 minutes of your life. If any type of horror is your thing then you must start to watch films like 'A Tale of Two Sisters', 'The Eye', 'Kairo' and 'Ju-on' to name a few. These films will alter how you judge other horror films and they will challenge your intellect as well as properly scare you.",Ghost Ship

Once they get on board the strange activities begin to take place causing murder and mayhem amongst the salvage crew.The film is pretty good but like all horror films does have its downfalls and this usually comes with the film being targeted at teens but not this film and that boosts the film in my eyes as it means there can be more of a gore fest and much more horror which is alway a good thing.The real downfall is that the film refuses to take advantage of that and really does have very watered down horror (pun intended) which is never a good thing. I think i jumped once through the entire film and i like to be scared more than that! The acting at times is wooden but in other parts quite good, Gabriel Byrne is very good at what he does and even in a horror film still gives such a good performance, and even if you don't take this film seriously he certainly does. The rest of the cast really fail to follow suit which is a shame.Now by this point you are probably thinking that all i've done is give bad points about the film, and also thinking, well you've given the film six out of ten so what's good about it? well i will reveal all.The film opens very misleadingly. We have very fancy pink title credits and lost of images of everybody having a good time on board this great cruise liner, but this is to show us how good the cruising experience was but now the horror comes in. As the passengers and the captain dance on the main deck, they are all decapitated by steel cabling, this has to be the most gruesome opening i've seen yet it set the tone of the movie, a tone i'm quite happy with.After the opening the film really kicks into gear getting off to a very fast start and if i'm being honest never lets up, from that point the action is ratcheted up constantly which is great because you are always waiting for the next big scene, right on the edge of your seat! I loved the whole production design, that was amazing how we are show the great grandness of it all and then many years later how it has simply rotted and become a sailing hell hole and its just fantastic, you really have to see it for yourselves to see how good it is.The look of the film is how you'd expect it to be, dark and very brooding which of course is necessary to produce the ultimate effect which is to scare the hell out of you.The direction is okay but not brilliant but it really is very rare to see a horror film with good direction, i don't think we've seen it since Carpenters Halloween or the Scream films by Wes Craven.The story is great and there are things going on all over the place as the salvager's search the ship to find out its deadly past, and the ending is a little too quick for my liking but still a good twist but just a little rushed. The dialog is very cheesy at times but when Gabriel Byrne delivers a line you really believe the guy because he really puts effort into his performance and it is nice to see that from a great actor! Overall the film must be said to be better than many other horror films as it has a good story going on and it does keep you guessing to the end and thats always great. The acting in places is a bit wooden but still its a good effort all round. If your looking for a haunted house film without the house this films for you!****** out of **********",Ghost Ship

I thought it was going to be a load of cheese, but it was acceptable.The story was acceptable on the way through the film... guy finds images of ship, guy gets salvage team to help him find it, things start to get dodgy...The effects were really good and it surprised me that it was released in 2002, I thought it was a wee bit older than that.Gabriel Bryne is good in it, the rest are alright.....That's about it really... an alright sort of thriller...6 out 10 for me....

183,enazwo,Sink this Stinker,2,4 November 2002,"Take the movie ""Titanic"" mix in part of ""The Haunting"", throw in a dash of bad directing, stir in two parts Hollywood logic gaps. Add a cup-o-cheesy acting. What's this a recipe for? Well other then a really bad horror flick you have none other then Warner Brothers half-baked ""Ghost Ship.""Directed by Steve Beck of ""Thirteen Ghosts"", ""Ghost Ship"" starts out with a lavish evening dinner and dance scene on a luxury Liner in 1953. Everyone is all fancied up and doing their best glamorous ballroom dance shtickThen some unknown person releases one of those kinds of support wires that do not exist on any real ship in the history of the world. However, this clever little support wire can attain an amazing amount of speed and momentum, plus make a real cool zipping sound. So fast and powerful is this wire that it shears through the entire crowd of dancers. The dancers stop; looking wild eyed, like ""Holy freaking cow did I just get cut in half, or something?""This scene is exhaustively contrived to be shocking and horrific as delightfully dressed dancers severed in varying areas begin to disassemble and collapse to the floor and wriggle around as they die.To me it was laughable. ""Ghost Ship"" contains these kinds of huge gaps of logic that make the entire movie ridiculous.Anyway flash to present day, where a salvage ship's crew are celebrating their recent recovery at a bar somewhere in Alaska.They are contacted by a pilot named Ferriman (I think the writers thought they were being clever with this name)who tells the salvagers about this abandoned Ocean Liner adrift in the Bering Sea he has discovered while flying looking for icebergs.The Captain of the salvage ship is played by none other then Gabriel Bryne who' s partner is played by none other the Julianna Margulies. For sure ""Ghost Ship"" has a superb cast, but they're not given anything to work with in the story, and script, department.So duh the Captain is going to say yeah, because as we all know rusty abandoned Ocean Liners in the middle of nowhere are always worth a ton-o-money.Shortly the crew of the salvage ship navigates the Bering Sea where they find the massive Luxury Liner. One of the remarkable feats the filmmakers accomplished here is making the Bering Sea seem as calm as a Hollywood back lot sound stage. Amazing!So the crew boards the Luxury Liner and then the action and scares commence. I won't spoil what happens, but you can ask yourself these questions.Are they going to have anything bad happen to them? Will they be able to swim around in the Bering Sea like it's a heated pool? Will there be special effects? Will the movie ever end? Can I get my money back?",Ghost Ship

185,roland-sinn,Paint by Numbers Horror,5,22 July 2003,"Some films require the viewer to be in a very specific mood in order to appreciate them. Ghost Ship is one such film.I watched Ghost Ship immediately after viewing Bowling for Columbine, and I loved it because it was perfect to wind down to after the intense experience of BFC. My viewing partner for Ghost Ship was less enthralled by the film. After the film's first five minutes he said: We know whose going to live and we know whose going to die. In fact I reckon I know the order in which they're going to die. They should have used the money wasted on this film to feed starving Africans!'Yes, GS is Paint by Numbers' Horror. For anyone who has watched more than one horror film before, there are no surprises. But this didn't ruin my experience of the film because I was in the right mood to slip my brain in neutral.What I enjoyed most about GS are the beautifully created visuals which are rich and slick. Also a lovely character strips and provides good views of her chest.SOME SPOILERS I loved the funky scene with techno background music where cruise passengers are being slaughtered by a gang of thugs. Although I normally find violence disgusting and repulsive, I found this scene unintentionally humorous because the funky score made me want to get out of my couch and get down and boogie!Many concepts in GS have also been done to death (no pun intended). There are some scenes which are painfully cliched. As an example, the opening scene of cruise passengers being sliced looks great but has been used similarly in Cube' and Resident Evil' to name two films.
The characters are card board (as other reviewers have mentioned) and there's some very low brow dialogue and info dump. Ie  The tug boat captain has to explain his crew and the audience the story of the Marie Celeste. Come on! Movie viewers aren't that dumb, I pray.5/10  5/5 for funky and fun production values, 0/5 for story originality and character development.",Ghost Ship

That said, I really liked Ghost Ship (I loved Event Horizon also).The beginning is truly classic and the ending is great as well.  Sure, the characters are somewhat generic, but there are some interesting layers to the plot if you go back and watch it a second time.  The sets and special effects are way better than most horror films have received in the past.I for one think it's great to see fairly high quality mainstream horror that has come out over the last few years.  These films have decent budgets, nice special effects, casts that can actually act, and well thought out writing.I really don't think it's fair to give them such a bad rap.  At least we're seeing some real effort being put into the horror genre these days, whereas guys like Wes Craven sold the genre out long ago with the spoon-fed crap they put out every year or two.8/10",Ghost Ship

The opening death sequence isn't that good, all the gore looks noticeably fake, unlike scenes in Saving Private Ryan, but it's ok, what I liked most about Ghost ship is the Twist, and the funky soundtrack that plays as the twist unfolds.

Got all the classic B-movie elements, good SFX, no really disgusting scenes, not depressive but well scary atmosphere (at least in the first two third), not boring (maybe only a little). Emily Browning's, Karl Urban's and Gabriel Byrne's acting is notable, the other cast's acting is decent, shooting is good (especially I like the lighting and the camera plunging effects), directing is nice, editing could be slightly better (I don't like these popular Matrix-like speed-ups/slow-downs in some scenes).

It does have a whopper of an opening, though. The minute the opening sequence ended, I immediately thought ""how are they going to top that?"" Well, they didn't.The cast is better than usual for a film like this and there's a nice studio shine to the whole film, letting us know that there was definitely a hefty budget in place for this movie, but there's not a lot of interesting things going on in here.Besides the opening sequence (and the flashback to the same events later on in the film), there's not much of a reason to recommend this movie.

There is blood, gore, much of this at the start of the movie, no sex, but a few boobs, a excellent story-line.One thing remains, what happened to all the bodies of the victims, who remove the dead from the swimming pool. Why was the body of the little girl left hanging, and not remove with the rest of the dead passengers and crew.Still watch this movie, its great.",Ghost Ship

This is a great horror film despite the fact that it's chock full of standard horror film boilerplate. Clocks that suddenly stop ticking when you look at them, little girls in party dresses, ghosts rising up out of the misty waters aren't anything you haven't seen before. Possessed people are locked up and meet their supernatural doom when no one is looking. Ghosts are visible in the mirror but not in the room. But it all fits together nicely to give the audience a generally creepy feeling. Wheat and chaff separate nicely and we're left with the scariest bits of horror in a paella of terror.

198,neal-57,A+ production values & performances wasted on C- story,7,8 July 2003,"The mystery here is why such absolutely wonderful production values were wasted on a story that falls apart as soon as it begins to supply ""answers"" about what's going on with this derelict liner clearly (and admittedly) based on the ""Andrea Doria.""  The transformation of the liner from its 1962 glamor to its present-day magnificent desolation is the cutting-edge of the film-maker's art, and the lushness of the sets is reason enough to give this film at least one look--just don't say you weren't warned when the storyline unravels to the point that Julianna Margulies, Gabriel Byrne & Company can no longer save it.  Incidentally, Margulies' role seems to be clearly patterned on Sigourney Weaver's ""Ripley"" in the ""Alien"" flicks, and she's more than adequate in it.  In fact, all the roles are given more characterization than is normal in this kind of horror film, and that includes the non-speaking roles of the ship's crew.  More's the pity that they're wasted on a picture whose goofs are so glaringly obvious:  click on the ""goofs"" section here on IMDB and you'll quickly see that this film about an Italian ship was made by people who know little Italian and less about the sea.Another reason for watching the film, at least for hetero guys and lesbians: Francesca Rettondini as the lounge singer is, with or without her breasts covered, the most beautiful woman I have seen on screen in many a year. Oh, and although it's Monica Mancini doing the singing rather than Rettondini, it's wonderful that ""Ghost Ship"" resurrected as its theme the beautiful ""Senza Fine"" from 1966's ""The Flight of the Phoenix.""",Ghost Ship

The first few minutes stick a hook into ya (hehehe) and it builds up a level of tension that is quite interesting.  The plot suffers from inherent discombobulation that will be apparent (don't wanna give away any spoilers). But, the frights are here and there and it's a worthy successor, and I think improvement, to Thirteen Ghosts..

Actually I own it, don't watch it too often but I do have it. I don't see how it's awful and I know that of course it's not great or even really that good.

One more complaint I have is I wish I would have seen more ghosts but hey B horror movie.I could talk about how the opening scene is one of the greatest I've ever seen in a horror movie but really everybody pretty much already has. For most after that they say the movie went downhill but I'm one of the few minority's.

The thing I loved most was the atmosphere of the sunken ship. The whole sight of it was chilling. All the gore was shocking. The snyopis was quite interestking. It was so scary and unexpected when the crew attempted to take the gold and ended having their small boat blown up by ghost power. I was surprised that Ferriman was the real villain in the story. The part where the spirits of the ship flew up to heaven looked so real. The ending confused me though. When Epps was in the ambulance why was ferriman boarding the ship? I thought he died in the explosion before the ship sank. The ending is kind of unnecessary. Overall I recommend this movie to any Horror/Thriller fan.,Ghost Ship

How did the ENTIRE crew of a ship different from the first two disappear? It took place in the Berring Sea, so how come no one got cold when they hit the water; no visible breath crystals; and wearing the wrong scuba gear? Very predictable movie. It started off with effects ripped from ""Final Destination 2"" with a wire cutting people in half, then went to ""House on Haunted Hill"" (the remake) and ""The Haunting"", then finally proceeded to copy the ballroom scene from ""The Shining"" (original).Only good part of this movie was watching people get cut in half.

It is very frustrating when you see a movie that has such high potential and then have it wind-up being a total disappointed. I don't think it was the actors fault because most of them gave a decent performance but the movie tended to sway away from the original point..almost like a modern Stephen King movie. The writers need to stay away from the supernatural bogus and stick more to the original point of the script.

I enjoyed the special effects that were made especially for this movie, packed with gore and corpses and the like. I didn't really like the fact that there was profanity (and a lot of it), but hey it's a horror film. The acting was good. Gabriel B, Julianna M, Ron E, Karl U, Emily B, Isaiah W, and Alex D really put effort into their characters and gave them life. The only actor that I didn't enjoy watching was Desmond Harrington. He didn't really put much effort into making a believable villain. Yeah, he was the one actor that I didn't like. The design of the Antonia Graza ocean liner was excellent, even though they showed it to be a falling-apart rust bucket. Photography, writing, special effects, directing, acting... ah well everything that had to do with the success of this movie made it all worthwhile. I mean, sure, of course I got scared. And one last thing: I am a HUGE fan of the band Mudvayne. I started listening to their music after listening to ""Not Falling"" in the end credits of the movie and have continued to do so ever since.

The cast is respectable 2nd tier all-star status beginning with Gabriel Byrne and right on down to a very young Emily Browning with some Ron Eldred, Isaiah Washington, Karl Urban and Julianna Margulies thrown-in, in-between, for good measure ... and they actually exhibit some chemistry with one another. The script is a little hokey at times but original and well-played enough to make it flow and keep you connected. One thing I really liked about this movie is how well the soundtrack jives with the flashbacks, acts and scenes. The TV version editors cut a lot of that out in the ""edited for tv"" edition, which leads me to this one last thing ... find this movie's unedited version, free of commercials. Otherwise you're missing-out on some key parts of the storyline which causes it not to flow as well.

OK, it's a little formulaic, but it's an interestingly different take on the usual 'trapped in a haunted house with a dreadful secret' theme. The inevitable, gradual reduction of the principal cast by various gory/unusual means (with the usual, sole 'good guy/girl' survivor...) is well enough done (without being overdone) and it's well enough acted, especially considering there are no big names here.There has also been enough effort put into the settings and scenery to make it quite 'believable' without too much reliance on CGI effects given the nature of the film - I had no problem with it at all. All other technical respects (SFX, props, sound, lighting, costumes etc.) are difficult to criticise.If you just want to be entertained and are not looking for a 'life changing experience' I can recommend it as a good alternative to the usual 'slash and scream' offerings as a film which will not bore you to death and where you will care about the fate of at least a few of the characters.Easily 7 out of 10....",Ghost Ship

218,susanxx,forget that cruise you always wanted!,7,21 January 2004,"This films best bits are in the special effects and those moments when you jump out of your seat. The opening sequence lulls you into a false sense of calm, from then on its guess the scenario.  The viewer is always two steps ahead of the actors but, for the most, grips you nevertheless. The special effects are especially good and the acting, although no top-notch stars are evident, is not bad. The end is a real twist.

219,Apollyon_Crash,Disappointing,4,19 December 2003,"When I originally heard about this movie, I thought it was an absolutely great idea. The sea is full of mystery, and some of the best unexplained phenomena and ghost stories take place there. Unfortunately, ""Ghost Ship"" didn't live up to my expectations.First of all, the setting is great, as is the backstory. Gorehounds will be hooked from the opening scene (inventive and gruesome, I'll admit). There are some very memorable sequences (including a great flashback montage), and a solid score complemented by a few good modern rock songs, which seem to fit the film well. On the downside, however, the direction is often too flashy (no real atmosphere is established), the ghosts are too chatty and too often visible, and the climax is incredibly hammy. The acting is decent for the most part, with special mention going to Gabriel Byrne (who's always good) and Desmond Harrington (who makes a great transition between his two personalities).All in all, it's worth a look for horror buffs, but it's a bit disappointing for what it could have been.4/10",Ghost Ship

From a very long rope, down a very deep pit.I am trying not to put a spoiler in but seeing as this happens early on in the film it doesn't really help.Everyone is cut in half on the dance floor apart from a single young girl. Firstly who is on the bridge steering and who is in the engine room. Not everyone would be in the one room surely. This must be against basic maritime practise.So everyone dies (almost) and this is the highlight of the film.

There is an especially laughable scene where fast rock music is playing during a scene from the past that made me really think that this movie couldn't suck any more.

Because, disappointingly, the originality ends with the premise.A pale, creepy, young girl, (ghost) with an empty stare in a pale blue dress. An apparent recovering alcoholic sitting at a long-since abandoned bar being poured drinks by a phantom bartender. A beautiful, young temptress who transforms into a (insert gasp here) old hag. Two unsuspecting men who are chowing down on food only to discover they've been eating maggots. Okay, so that last one was lifted from ""Lost Boys"".Point being, yes.

I knew within seconds what was going to happen with the cable but couldn't have envisioned the lovely cleanness of that scene.  What a way to die!Some of the scenes were literally skin-crawling, I haven't experienced that level of skin-crawliness since the first time I saw the exorcist in the mid-70's.  The scenes in the first half, before they all start communicating with the ghosts, were especially good.And, at the risk of sounding like a pervert, that little girl is going to be gorgeous some day.  Absolutely beautiful child.I have to admit, in retrospect, that the end of the film was lacking, and part were downright annoying (like the souls all flying up to meet their sky god).

228,Everwas,Failed attempt at horror entertainment,3,26 October 2002,"This film is not worth seeing in the theater--unless, like me, you get a free pass and don't have to pay to see it.  It's surprising that a somewhat mainstream horror film could fail so badly in almost every way.  The plot is of some interest, but the writers/director fail to exploit the interesting things about the situation and instead revert to stock characters and techniques that fail on almost every level.  (For one example, the African American character is driven primarily by lust in the film and wears a shirt that says ""Everlast."")  In addition, the dialogue is almost all cliche tripe that just emphasizes the ordinary nature of the film.Most importantly for a film like this, the story is not scary, and is only minimally entertaining.  Because the characters are so one-dimensional and superficial, we really have no stake in their journey, and any attempt to draw us in seems contrived and proves unfruitful.  Furthermore, there really aren't many scenes that are scary--you would think a Ghost Ship in the middle of the sea would be ripe with some possibility for screams, but instead the film is predictable and nearly bereft of them.  (And why else would anyone see a movie like this around Halloween?)The only reason I gave this movie a 3 rating instead of a 2 is because of one interesting sequence near the end of the second act--a stylish flashback montage aimed at exposition that is really one of the only successful and interesting achievements of the film.  This success is short-lived, though, as the ending is unreal and nonsensical.  Catch it on cable or not at all.",Ghost Ship

The first ten minutes holds a shocking scene that will surprise and most likely sicken your senses, otherwise the movie floats on without really testing my paranoid fear that i might have if i was actually on a ""ghost ship"" It's funny i can always discover a bad horror movie when i see it, because of random guys such as my gf's ex that just go yea that was awesome, without questioning why it was or wasn't. This being said to me true horror is a concept that you can legitimately imagine and feel the fear of the characters within the third dimension of the film itself. This movie certainly does drop anchor in your sense of fear and danger, it drops anchor in a much different way. I gave this film a 4 because it acknowledge the attempt to be original with a not so much rehashed idea, but there are better haunted sea and boat movies out such as the wildly entertaining Deep Rising which never makes sense but gives you a sense of danger, however Ghost Ship does surpass the lame and very unsavory Virus, but if you want the best for fear in an ocean, look no further than Steven Spielberg's classic, Jaws",Ghost Ship
230,Ghostly83,Gore For Once!!!!,8,26 October 2002,"I am so happy that for once a film actually shows the deaths happening. With more recent Horror films they are always too worried about ratings to have any gore in them. I was worried with going to see this with the let done of 13 Ghosts, which wasn't terrible but it didn't have the punch I was hoping for. I really liked this though, I got the punch and was happy leaving the theater. This film didn't really have the jump in your seat mood, but it did have the Horror and Gore. Now I admit it didn't have a lot of this but it was at least something, I mean this isn't your direct to video Gore Fest. But Horror Fans should enjoy it. I know I did! The effects were great although the ship CGI wasn't all that wonderful, but it's sufficient. Anyway this is a good Halloween movie go see it with your friends.

231,Danny_84,Do yourself a favor - disregard the bad reviews you've read,8,2 February 2003,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSI can't believe how underrated this film is, by both the critics and other IMDb users. This is a classic to me.The opening scene is my all-time favourite opener to a film. It's one of the oldest tricks in the book of making a horror film  give the audience a false sense of security and then BANG get to the scares. I've never been one for gore in horror films, it's usually so cheap  but the opening scene is really well done.The rest of the story unfolds into a good haunted house story (haunted ship rather) and sure, it does use all the old clichés (Blood coming out of walls, food turning into maggots) but it does it so well.Acting was good, SFX were very well done. Emily Browning, who plays the little girl/ghost Katie, was especially impressive and she will no doubt have a long future acting career ahead of her.If I was to add constructive criticism, the scene in which Katie shows Epps what actually happened on the ship that night, the music used was out of place and didn't add atmosphere to another gory scene.All in all, a great flick. If you are a fan of the genre you'll love it. Not one for peoples with a weak stomach :)10/10",Ghost Ship
232,cvw,"Not absolutely horrible, but not great, either...",5,21 October 2002,"Much as I hate to pre-judge something, from the moment I saw the poster, I thought of GHOST SHIP as a pile of crap.  Is that fair?  No.  Is it understandable?  Hell, yes.  Hollywood horror films have been either not very good to ass-kickingly Gawdawful for quite a while now, and this showed no signs of bucking the trend.  Add to that the fact that director Steve Beck's only other film was THIR13EN GHOSTS, and, well...what would YOU think?  So the film starts, and... ...hey.  The opening's not half bad.  Chock full of clichés, certainly, but not without a sense of sophistication.  The setting is a luxury cruise liner sometime in the past (turns out it's in the early 60s.)  Beck allows the scene to flow, and you actually get a sense of what it might be like on the ship until THWACK, the horrible thing we all knew was gonna happen happens. And, bizarrely enough, it's actually unsettling.  And gory as all Hell, of course.  But unlike pretty much every other recent horror film, it's handled with some sense of what to show and what not to show.  There's still loads of blood, but it's not excessive.  Just disturbing.Now, I'm not gonna give you a blow by blow of the film's narrative, but one thing GHOST SHIP deserves credit for is its attempt to actually tell a story.  This is not simply a situation film, where the characters find themselves in a tight spot and spend all 5 reels getting killed while trying to get out of it.  No, there's actually something going on under the hood. It ends up getting fumbled, but the fact that they tried it at all raises eyebrows.In a nutshell: a Coast Guard pilot alerts our intrepid crew that there is a big ass ship, just floating out there in international waters, waiting to be claimed.  Loads of cash for the salvage crew that can snag it.  They get there, it turns out to be a legendary ghost ship.  They get on board, and of course, things are not what they seem.  Although the ship has been missing for four decades, they find a digital watch.  Then they find some bodies less than a month old.  Julianna Marguiles starts talking to a little girl who seems to appear only for her.  And they find gold.  Turns out there's more to the situation as a whole than we first believe...Unfortunately, director Beck is not a storyteller.  The clues are dropped, the situation is set up, but all is ultimately explained in a hasty, extended flashback that seems more concerned with tying up loose ends than with adding anything to the movie.  Actually, the flashback itself isn't half bad, except for the ridiculously stupid faux-rock song they glued on top of it.  Considering the fact that what we're seeing happened forty years ago on a luxury liner, the last thing I want to hear is some suburban poser eunuch screaming over regurgitated corporate ""rock.""The resolution to all this is really stupid.  Poorly conceived, poorly handled.  There have been enough holes in the narrative and situations at this point that this isn't surprising (and wow, I could've sworn gold was a lot heavier than it appears to be here.)  It is, however, disheartening, since there are a small handful of genuinely well-done sequences.  The opening, as mentioned above, as well as a jump out at you scare involving the little girl that is actually, well, scary.  And there is a scene of spirits escaping that is, dare I say it, beautiful.So, ultimately, is GHOST SHIP good?  No.  Whenever the crew has to interact with itself, which is quite a bit during the sluggish middle third, it's pure pain.  Generic pain, at that.  Note to future filmmakers: if you're going to populate your movie with stock characters, don't try to get them to carry the story.  They can't.  Also, too much of what is good-to-OK about this is lifted from THE SHINING, ALIEN, and other stuff you've seen.  Not to mention all but one of the character deaths are anti-climactic, seemingly unimportant. Isn't this what's supposed to be the scary part, the fear of death thing?  Hell, one even happens off camera.  The one death that IS somewhat unsettling is too contrived to be impressive.But, all in all, I can't say that there weren't a few unexpected moments of creepiness, even if they were too few and way too far between.  It's just a baby step away from the pile of suck out there, but a step is a step. GHOST SHIP isn't very good, but it does, in some small way, give me hope.",Ghost Ship

Little do we know what awakes the dancing guests on the cruise ship. Within seconds most of them will drop dead, literally.

The artic warrior team makes a quick decision to try to find the boat, and delay there vacation for a few weeks.

I love Dark Castle entertainment, I didn't love 13 Ghosts, but I did really enjoy House on Haunted Hill. I loved the original HoHH, and I thought the 'remake' was inventive and had some unique parts to it. It wasn't brilliant, but the special effects were beautiful and the sets were magnificent.As a technical theatre student studying everything from stage management to lighting design these films are wonderful exercise in how to create atmosphere through lighting, sound & setting.Okay so the film wasn't Oscar worthy, particularly well written or particularly well acted, but it did create an atmosphere it did give us a sense of setting and era... and to top it all off, everything was lush in detail.The special effects team had done their homework. During the opening scene where they're all cut up by the high-tension cable, not only was it gory and creepy, but it was accurate to a degree. The lighting effects with the light reflecting off the water, the dripping sounds and the sound track were all amazing.I would watch this film again, but only the opening and the middle part where Katie takes us on a journey through what happened. I enjoyed the film, and that's all films are really about - enjoyment. The background history here was errie and disturbing, there was a definite sense of panic here; made me think about how vulnerable you are travelling on board of a ship, your fate put completely in the hands of total strangers.A lot more could have been made of the film though. More exploration of the ship, discovery of more bodies or something to alert people that something wasn't quite right about this ship. More background story about the gold! The dead captain told the live captain that they salvaged the gold from a sinking ship, more background was needed.After watching the film I was left with a feeling of wanting to know 'why' it happened, rather than *what* was going to happen next.Kudos to the special effects team, possibly the first time I've felt sick watching a film. You knew what was going to happen from the camera shots of the tension cable, but I wasn't quite expecting that!

254,Bab5er,Defeat snatched from the jaws of victory once again... (spoilers!),3,31 January 2004,"(Spoilers!!!)I had already seen ""Thirteen Ghosts"" before sitting down to ""Ghost Ship"" and knew they were from the same team. Yet I was astounded to see the same errors committed all over again. Or rather, _one_ huge error...For me, good horror consists of two basic elements. One is, of course, good suspense and some gory atrocities. The other element, required to make the horror work, is some degree of identification with the characters undergoing the horrors. Or at least some sense that you *know* the characters in question. Without that, you might as well be watching news reports of gruesome violence happening to total strangers (with all due respect). I'm not saying that characters in horror movies have to be deep and involving, mind you, but they cannot be allowed to remain unfamiliar faces.  Movies that fail the same way that ""Ghost Ship"" fails, are ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Alive"" and ""Thirteen Ghosts"". The ""Scream"" trilogy is a good example of characters being properly introduced before being killed off. So are more recent movies like ""Deathwatch"", ""Resident Evil"" and ""28 Days Later"". The horror matters to the viewer because the *people in the movie* matter to the viewer!Not so in ""Ghost Ship"", unfortunately... The movie is barely 90 minutes long, not so much as a single character rises above being one dimensional and they start getting bumped off before you can even put a name to their faces. Which is too bad, because an actor like Gabriel Byrne could have made some really juicy scenes work. In stead, his character gets drowned after having what feels like barely 15 minutes of screen time. More or less the same thing applies to the other ""characters"" in the movie. Or rather, ""extras"" appears to be a more accurate classification, since there are no real characters here to speak of... Another problem here is the somewhat rickety plot. In the end, it is revealed that some sort of demon has staged everything about this Ghost Ship. Everyone who dies on the ship, is trapped there and once the quota is full, the whole thing will be taken to hell. In order to give people a chance, only immoral people  get ""marked"" by the demon for their transgressions. But the ""good guys"" who die also get linked to the ship, and it is not really clear if the ship going to hell would hurt them also. Exactly what marks the boundary between good and evil here is never made clear, except that killing a human being is always an evil deed (or so the demon claims). Now, it would be logical if the extras that comprise the salvage crew all wind up in moral dilemmas, their reaction to which seals their fate. But that is not really how it works. The engineer working on the engines gets blown up due to sabotage by the demon. The black guy (Greer?) gets adulterous with a woman he knows to be a ghost, and he falls into a shaft because he attempts to lean on her. Murphy (Byrne) gets drowned by the demon after he gets locked up for attacking an illusion overlapping the female crew member. Another one of the divers also gets mangled by sabotage. The last male salvage crew member gets killed off screen... Aside from Murphy giving into booze and Greer beating himself up over some possible procedural error that may or may not have contributed to the death of the engineer, it is hard to see if any of them did anything that was so wrong they deserved to die for it. Or was them being enthralled by the gold really so bad? There is also a problem with the amount of power the demon has. He can basically control levers, switches and machinery at will. This basically means that he can squat his victims like flies. This unbalanced situation means that nobody really has a chance, which goes against the basic horror movie ground rule that moral characters who keep their wits about them should always be able to make it out alive. There are also some strange inconsistencies in the movie. Early on, it is discovered that the ship must have been boarded more recently (through the find of the digital watch). Then there are the fresh corpses that turn up somewhere. But this is never really followed up on. What is even stranger is that the first character to realize that something is wrong and who *knows* he is dealing with ghosts, lets himself get killed so easily. One last point. It is mentioned quite often that the ship is drifting far away from major shipping lanes. But when the one survivor drifts off on an old suitcase, she gets picked up by another cruise ship in no time...Would it really have been so hard to build characters around some of the cardboard cut outs that parade through this movie as it is? The total lack of any depth is even more infuriating when you realize that in terms of sets and SFX there is little to complain about... The idea of a ghost ship is fairly fresh too. And there was more than enough screen time left for some character introduction/building. Nobody would have balked at this movie being 2 hrs 20 mins in length in stead of the present 1 hr 20 mins.
If I hear of another movie made by this ""Dark Castle"" crowd, I'll be sure to stay well away from it!In short: shame, shame, shame!3/10",Ghost Ship
255,helge-fauskanger,Atmospheric at its best,6,1 June 2013,"As many have pointed out, there would be potential for more here, but the movie doesn't stink. The rusting, massive ship is very well realized, and forms an atmospheric setting. If the movie makers had only known what ""subtlety"" means, and cut back on cheap scares, they could have produced something almost up there with The Shining! Yet even the movie as it is shouldn't be regarded as a total trainwreck (or shipwreck...) Some of the acting may be so-so, but young Emily Browning as ghost girl Katie deserves all the praise she can get. In the flash-back scene where we finally learn just what happened on the ship back in 1962, the despair of the still-living Katie is absolutely believable, and harrowing to watch. Also, some of the special effects are, at the very least, decent. You may have to suspend a lot of disbelief, but there really is a quite unique eerie beauty to the final scenes where the sinking ship is surrounded by a literal SWARM of newly-released spirits. With quite a few vulgar scares eliminated and a more subtle approach to the whole story, this could have been a great horror movie, and even the missteps of the film as we have it don't altogether spoil it.",Ghost Ship

Some of the things I don´t like are the invincible forces of evil and the unlikely unhappy endings. But for this movie, I didn´t even care for the unhappy ending or the death of most characters. It gets boring sometimes, only a little scary at the beginning, and the plot is awful: no logic at all. Too bad Byrne wasted his talent on this one. He doesn´t seem to care too much either.

To be fair, there have been a lot worse movies made, and I have been subjected to many of them...and this one wasn't exactly horrible...but it had a whole lot of potential that it never even thought about aspiring to.  Some of the special effects were pretty darn good...and some were pretty darn bad.  The good one's included the massacre of the passengers dining and dancing on the foredeck at the beginning of the movie.  Also when the ballroom went from being a wreck to its former elegance, that was cool.  The ship sinking at the end and persumably the trapped souls ascending into Heaven, they were bad. Granted it cost $200,000,000.00 to build, film, and then sink ""Titanic,"" but would it have killed them to sink this Italian ship with a model instead of a bad computer-generated, digital whatever-you-call-it?  Then came the annoying questions:  How did a massive Italian ocean liner that apparently sailed across the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic, and end up in the Bering Sea? How did it get there without ever being seen?  Did it pass through the Panama Canal?  Around the southernmost tip of South America?  How did this ship appear and disappear at random on the salvage tug's radar?  It was obviously solid enough to bump into the reef once, wasn't that solid enough to produce a permanent radar echo? Where did the lifeboats go?  For that matter, where did all the bodies go? Understandably the bodies decompose, but surely the bones, clothes, and jewelry would be left around...yet, there's none to be found.  Finally, Julianna Margulies ends up floating in the sea for God knows how long, and is little worse for the wear?  I don't think the film maker knows where the Bering Sea is, or she should have ended up like the men- and womencicles who got washed off the 'Titanic.'  And the least of which, a passing cruise ship just happens to spot her floating around on a little crate in the middle of the Pacific?  Let's be a little realistic, shall we?  Then there are the characters.  I didn't care one wit about any of them.  Blown up, drowned, impaled, crushed...I didn't give a second thought to the death of any one of them.  Shouldn't the director and writer, not to mention the actor, do something...anything...to make a character sympathetic?  I guess not in this one.  As far as ghost stories go, this one couldn't make up its mind whether to be gory or scary.  In the end, it just decided to be stupid.",Ghost Ship
258,milamlaw,"Poor, poor, poor",2,24 April 2003,"I was hoping for an intense psychological thriller, but got a boring slasher movie.  A lost and deserted ocean liner, semi-invisible to radar, is found adrift after forty years - an idea that has potential.  The Marie Celeste, a real ghost ship that was referenced in the movie, has a fascinating story, for example.  However, the idea is ruined with a stupid, predictable plot. The only fun thing is guessing early on which character(s) will survive (and of course, you know the cool, butch chick will make it, while the minority characters will not).  The ending was hokey and really didn't make sense given the events leading up to it.  The devil-like bad guy supposedly lost his ship, his gold and his collection of souls, to the ostensible dismay of his ""employer.""  Yet he doesn't get ""fired"" (pun intended), but reappears with gold and souls.  Lame attempt at an shocking twist, I suppose.I watched this movie alone, in the dark, in my basement - and it still didn't scare me.  Just before Ghost Ship, I had watched Scooby Doo.

The plot revolves around a rag-tag group of ocean salvagers who are given the opportunity to salvage a gigantic ocean liner.  This isn't just any ocean liner, it's an Italian ship that was bound for the US in 1962 and vanished from the face of the earth.  No survivors were ever found much less the ship itself. To make a long story short, the team of salvagers board the ship to find nothing but remnants; no corpses just their belongings.  More eerie, all the life boats and life vests were gone, suggesting that the passengers jumped ship.  However, no survivors were ever found.  Strange huh? Anyway, they board the ship that is apparantly haunted by a demon who likes to eat souls.  Once he fills his quota, he can return to hell.  He has devoured the souls of the passengers, now he's hungry for the souls of the salvagers.  All of this unfolds in a slow, unintersting narrative that doesn't build any tension or terror.

The actors did a good job of looking scared, but beyond that there wasn't anything special, just the typical reactions you could find any lower quality horror flick. There seemed to be potential for them but because they didn't go very deep into their roles, their characters were pretty one-dimensional. The rest of the film did not compensate for that though, being filled with plot holes, vague explanations, and obvious flaws. I must admit, there were some really good scenes in this movie, taking place primarily in the past, but they are too few to cover up the main faults.

Either a ship that doesn't really exist  i.e. a ghost ship - or a ship that does exist and is full of ghosts  i.e. a ghost('s) ship?

You'll have to watch it to find out which (if at all) exist. What I didn't expect (or did I?) were a) the absurd (or absurdly nebulous?) denouement, b) plot holes you could sink a ship in, and c) the complete lack of credulity (the world's most dangerous sea calmer than a nun on Valium, flashlights running on Super-Duracell, professional salvagers wandering about willy-nilly on a half-submerged wreck  and divers smoking?).

In particular I would praise Emily Browning and Isaiah Washington; Gabriel Byrne, of course, is as dependable as ever.If you must know, the film concerns the efforts of a stereotypical salvage crew to recover a passenger liner that has been drifting for around 40 years. It isn't going to scare the pants off you and it isn't going to sear itself into your memory; but if you have nothing better to do, you could do worse than watch it.",Ghost Ship
283,Emmek,NOOOOOOOO!!!,1,10 May 2003,"This is probably the worst screenplay I've ever seen come out on dvd. Starts of in the very first scene where the female lead need to be depicted as the 'hero'. This is supposed to be accomplished by her jeopardizing the lives of her entire crew, rather then cutting loose some type of float they're tugging, an thus saving the float. These types of 'character describing' scenes are usually pretty sought out, but this is the first time I've seen the goals 'brave' and 'daring', actually come off as 'greedy' and 'eresponsible'. This just continues on through the rest of this horrible film, and it just seems as if the film was started because the makers didn't have anything better to do, and got worse during the making because they found something better to do. Don't watch this unless you're already in a bad mood. -10 of 0 to 10",Ghost Ship

Then, THWACK, a metal wire on the dancing deck flings across and cuts everyone in half (this is maybe the only original scene throughout the entire film, if you like gore that is). It's without a doubt very exaggerated and almost unbelievable, but you appreciate it because they've tried to at least be different.The rest of the film plays out like a typical horror does, one person getting picked off one at a time, weird things happen which we can't quite make sense of as viewers- for example: when the 'treasure seeking' tugboat blows up due to 'ghosts', the present day crew somehow get back on board the ghost ship- which originally they needed a cherry picker to raise them high enough to get onto the 60metre high ship in the first place.

289,aranea-diademata,"Decent mix, but nothing special.",5,28 January 2005,"Take the ""Dark Castle""-Company, (in)famous for their more or less acceptable rip-offs; use ""Death Ship (1980)"" as basis; add a very large bit of ""Event Horizon (1997)"" and spice it with the Andrea Doria (sunk in a spectacular accident, but without many fatalities, in 1956). Put it through a meat chopper (rough) and add a soaked bread roll. Fry with some fat and burn it on a DVD; that's ""Ghost Ship"".The movie is a decent mix; something to have a nice evening with, but nothing special. The story is OK; as a mix of Event Horizon and Death Ship, there should not be very much to go wrong. A salvage crew aboard the ""Louis and Clark""... sorry, ""Arctic Warrior"" gets sent out to get an Italian ocean liner (with strong resemblances to the ""Andrea Doria""); finds out that the ship is infested with ghosts that died in an atrocity some 40 years ago (not Nazi atrocities, but close enough; the sub-machine guns were German MP38/MP40 (falsely known as ""Schmeissers"")) and that are hungry for their souls. Sounds familiar? Sounds familiar. (Hey, that's no spoiler; you'll know that much after seeing the trailer.) The movie is amusing; not dramatic, not horrific, and neither terrific nor terrible. You may rent the DVD in the mid-to-low-price subject, and I'd spend 10 to 15 Euros maximum on it if I were to buy it (if it includes German and English language versions). The atmosphere works OK, and the soundtrack may be the best of the movie. Only then-14-year old Emily Browning cast a lasting impression on me. As it may be the identification figure for the intended audience, no wonder there.Sometimes the movie felt like ""Event Horizon light"" (or ""for adolescents""). Where Death Ship and Event Horizon alike thrilled the viewer from one horror climax to the next, using the fear of the unknown as well as leaving much to the imagination of the viewer, nothing alike is to be found in ""Ghost Ship"". On the bright side, after discovering that its director is Steve Beck (Thir13en Ghosts), I braced myself for a MUCH worse movie. However, what annoyed me most was that sometimes, the directors of cheap rip-offs are decent enough to pay some hidden homages to the movies they copied from; nothing here. As Death Ship is a real sleeper and Ghost Ship copied even the poster from it, this leaves the stale aftertaste that Beck hoped to get away with no one noticing that he got the idea with the literal ""soul-catcher"" (German ""Seelenverkäufer"", for a derelict rust-bucket of a ship) from 1980s B-movie by Alvin Rakoff; a pity, that movie deserves to get some attention (and a good DVD).",Ghost Ship

I found this movie superlative in respect to the genre, and high in production values.  The movie opens on the dance floor of a cruise ship in 1962, with a female vocalist performing the same tragic love song heard in THE FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX.  The scene where the wire cuts through the middle of a throng of dancing couples is an instant classic, its timing impeccable, the camera sweeping in slow motion the bewildered faces of the suddenly silenced crowd, in the bare seconds before they succumb en masse.  But this is not only a horror story, it is also a mystery.  Who killed the original passengers and crew, and what happened to the only little girl left alive?  Fast forward 40 years to the small crew attempting to salvage the ghost ship.  In the true tradition of horror each new victim must first earn his fate.  Avarice, pride, greed, lust ... one by one they meet their just demise.  Nothing is predictable, nothing is telegraphed.  This film will make you believe in ghosts.

But not to be.... Instead 1 of the ghosts advises them to get off the ship, oh great! Then one of them is actually quite fit! Until she turns away, then she looks like they all should in a horror movie.If I was making this movie I would of killed all but one off in a gory fashion and let 1 of them take the gold, that girl.

303,kyle-09486,Pretty scary from what I remember,8,11 December 2015,I saw this back in 2005 and it was pretty scary then...I guess now this film is not as scary as some today. In a way it could be a fictional version of what would have happened had the titanic not sank and had instead floated for a couple decades. It starts with a ship recovery crew that is sent out to find a ghost ship that has been afloat for awhile and the passengers have disappeared. Soon after they board the ship one of the crew died. Throughout the movie most of the crew dies. Some of them do have a gruesome death like one person got a hook through their head. Another thing that happens throughout the film is people start saying former passengers and how they died. In the end th main leader is injured and taken to shore and one of her former crew members is seen boarding another ship just like the former one and is seen carrying gold aboard. I forgot to mention that crew member is a ghost who was on the ghost ship and I believe he haunts the gold aboard both ships.,Ghost Ship
304,davidwarner_za,"Does enough, could be better",7,29 August 2006,"Well, not bad. Not great, but not bad. I am a big fan of horror movies that aren't all about the horror but are more about a good, well thought out storyline. Think ""Sixth Sense"". While Ghost Ship pales in comparison, it has enough elements in it that satisfies me for me to give it a thumbs up, albeit a hesitant one.Set and production design ... brilliant. It's incredibly difficult to not believe it's being filmed on location on a real decrepit, falling-apart ship. Inside and outside, it's filled with lush visuals that draw you into the movie. But i'm jumping ahead of myself.The beginning is awesome. I love it. Never before have I been so impressed by the first couple of minutes of a movie, like I have been with Ghost Ship. Although the 'dramatic pause' after the event goes on for a bit too long (it doesn't really build up tension because you know what happened) the effect still works well overall and the special effects and acting are pretty damn good. Very nice. As is all the gory stuff in the movie.Katie is brilliant. The first close-up we get of her, she looks cold and wet and although not frightening, she looks seriously spooky. Initially, I was mentally preparing myself for her to be heavily involved in the 'scares' of the movie, but was pleasantly surprised at her innocence throughout the movie, revealing later on exactly why she is the way she is.The acting is solid enough - not brilliant (with exception of Katie, who does a very good job of tensing things up again - more so than any scare tactics) and the direction is pretty good, with the focus being on the right things and the pace of the movie consistent.I do feel not enough attention was paid to the history behind the back-story of the ship's strange events (i.e. the ""Lusitania"" and how the gold came to be on the ghost ship itself) as well as a suspiciously obvious lack of character background for some of the characters, although the lack of it doesn't really detract from the movie itself, but makes you realize how important these details can be after watching the movie.Emotionally I swayed through the movie. Many times I was thoroughly engaged to it, and you feel like a part of the world. At other times I felt totally disconnected as the actors didn't do enough to keep my attention. But then, something would happen that would raise my eyebrows just a bit.Speaking of that, the scene where Katie takes Epps 'back' and shows her what happened - wow! I must say that I love that scene ... the camera work is awesome and the acting from the many extras is outstanding. But once again, it is what happens to Katie that is utterly harrowing. It's not often that I utter ""Oh my God ..."" in a soft shocked whisper as my mouth refuses to close. That scene packed a punch that lasted a long time.On the other hand, the scene near the end with the people in the cargo room was totally rushed, with just too much happening and too many switches and deaths and, well, the message is obvious but it occurs with seemingly minor character such as Francesca that didn't seem to (at the time) make any significant contribution to the story. Having said that, after re-watching, I see how Francesca fits into it, based on the motive of the characters and the flow of the story. But it just seems a bit over-the-top ... not in violence, but in concept.The thing that killed it ... the ending. Awful. Did they run out of money? Time? I just didn't get why it had to end like that. Sequels aside (how can there be a successful sequel? The 'Antonio Graza' sunk ... so would there be a different boat? Hmmmm...) the ending feels totally pointless. I didn't get it, and I didn't like it either. Do the bad souls leave the ship and go to another ship in the near future?? Having said that, I think the whole 'souls' thing is a bit ridiculous, because despite it tying in with the movie's concept, it seems to justify having strange occurrences on the ship, rather than having the strange occurrences justify the reason for the ghosts. I hope that makes some sense.At the risk of looking at this too deeply for a horror flick, I think that there's more to the gold than just being 'stolen gold' - in my mind, the movie is not about the ghosts, or the gold, or the ship. It's mostly about pure greed - which the gold represents, and the evil in people which will never die. Which is the only reason why the ending could be as it is, in my eyes, since 'evil' walks out with the gold, to trap some more people into 'being evil' and therefore 'selling his soul' - note that the gold has no markings AT ALL and the tracing numbers have been 'filed down' - does the gold even exist??? After all, it was pure greed that got the crew out there in the first place, even though there was a good chance that they'd leave with nothing of significant value despite the attached investment of time and money but without being 'intentionally' greedy. Anyway, those are some questions that I wasn't too sure about after watching the movie, even after another viewing. So, overall, pretty decent. But more work needed to be put into the ending and the character development ... even if it added an extra 15 minutes. It would turn a goodish movie into a solidly good movie.6/10 is too low, 7/10 is too high. 6.5 but promoted to 7 because of that awesome opening and 'flashback' scene.",Ghost Ship

306,tin_omen,Decent fare,7,27 October 2002,"To start with, classifying 'Ghost Ship' as horror (in the teen-slasher vein) is a misnomer; it has a few decidedly gorey scenes, but in the main the film is a suspense piece about figuring out why the ship is where it is, and how it got there, against the interesting backdrop of the waterlogged old cruise ship. There's not much in the way of boogie monsters chasing people around the ship, if that's what you're after.This wasn't art, but it was definitely entertaining. When I go to see a movie with a title like, 'Ghost Ship', I'm not expecting extensive plot development, well-drawn characters or oscar-calibre acting. I'm just looking for some decent shocks, an interesting or non-predictable story, and most especially well-produced sets and effects. It's all about developing a believable mood. The film delivered on all of the above accounts.
Good stuff. Along with The Ring, this has definitely been a pretty good month for 'non-teen horror'. On the whole, I've liked wht 'Dark Castle' has produced: I genuinely liked the remake of 'House on Haunted Hill'. '13 Ghosts' was worth the admission, but wasn't quite up to snuff.

I am not a fan of gore at all, I prefer horror that doesn't rely on blood and guts, but this is an example of gore used the right way. The gross parts (and they're pretty shocking) are kept to a minimum and enhance the story.  The ship itself is frightening in its own right and cast of characters that come alive with it are rather interesting.

I could define this site a tragedy when you deliver judgement on the horror film. The film is beautiful, quite violent, with a romantic tone. With a sbarilottata and lean Rettondini. Body very conventional and within small and expired now, I prefer other actresses. A good 10 can be assigned. As I have written in the past I do not like films that talk about ghosts, monsters and vampires but this film deserves for setting and for very dense atmosphere. The ghosts were shot many films and violence reigns supreme, the most important thing is to love the violence that often are spread by them. Again a good movie.",Ghost Ship
318,mrsantUSCG,BIG GOOF!!!!,1,31 October 2002,Having been stationed in Alaska and sailing on the bering sea for 2 years it was completley insulting to me that the even suggested that this woman couldve survived in the arctic waters of the Bering Sea until she was rescued.  The survival time in those freezing waters is 15 to 19 minutes and the hypothermia affects your ability to swim immediatley upon entering the water however everyone in this film jumps in and out of the water like if they were in the carribean.Other than obvious mistake the rest of the movie was standard horror flick material thats been done before.  Enough to entertain you and pass the time but not to make an impression.For a true movie that delivers chills go with The Sixth Sense or Dragonfly.,Ghost Ship

The plot was stupid, the writing was lousy, the predictability (sp?) was laughable and there was no explanation for the closing scene.  It wasn't scary, it was just, I don't know -- stupid.

The acting was not so great but the story definetly could have been good if done right.  If the film had a bigger budget, and some A-List stars this movie wouldn't be half bad.  Unfortunatly it disappoints us, and falls way short of a good movie. **/*****",Ghost Ship

I could watch it for a countless number of times, and I would still be entertained. Its able to keep your attention like that. I find many horror movies can't go by without being stupid. But this kept me interested right from the death scene in the very beginning. The actors in my opinion were wonderful, but I think the female lead should have been played by Michelle Rodriquez (Resident Evil, The Fast and the Furious) Anyway, I highly recommend this to everyone who is horror-movie obsessed. 10/10 all the way. Other movies that are similar to Ghost Ship and with your while are 'The Ring' and 'Resident Evil'",Ghost Ship

I would say that my favourite part was when they entered the Ghost ship and all them weird traps were happening. I thought the little girl (who was a ghost) was scary at the beginning because the way her face was and the way she popped up when you least expected it! But when You realised she was a nice girl it wasn't too scary. I would give this film a definite 10/10!!! as it was scary, funny, a lot of action took place.",Ghost Ship
325,a-chen12,Good,6,29 February 2012,"OK ghost story. The movie starts off with a VERY gruesome bloody opening with a whole ship full of people being killed in 1962. It then cuts to present day (well--2002) where a salvage crew is led to a deserted vessel (the same one from the beginning) and find there's something inside that wants them. Dead bodies are discovered, doors open and close (and lock) by themselves and a creepy girl ghost watches over all of it.So-so. The movie LOOKS good (the deserted vessel is impressive) but the story is slow and the characters are never fully realized. Also top billed Gabriel Byrne (giving a terrible performance) is hardly in the movie. On the plus side Julianna Margulies is good and a strong female character (unusual in any horror movie) and Alix Dimitriades and Ron Eldard are good as members of the crew. Desmond Harrington also has a few good moments. But the slow pace and a predictable and stupid ending sinks this (sorry)",Ghost Ship
326,thatmadcupcakex,Surprisingly Deceiving Movie... Well Worth a Watch!,10,9 June 2015,"This being the first horror movie I ever saw, I had high hopes for it. And I must say, I certainly was not disappointed. When the opening credits first rolled, I was half considering whether I was still watching a horror movie or if I had accidentally bought the wrong DVD. The credits are very deceiving, I almost believed I was watching a romcom and not a horror movie as the DVD case portrayed it to be. However, after the opening scene which I'm sure others who have watched the movie will agree with me on, I was certain that the DVD definitely contained the gruesome horror I was looking for. This movie is quite frankly, a cinematic masterpiece. The effects and story are incredible and pull you in almost instantly which I haven't experienced with many horror movies which are normally repetitive, cheesy, and contain cheap effects that could make you yawn. This is certainly a stand alone horror, not many movies could be compared to this. If you are looking for a simple horror movie with a boring plot, this movie certainly is not for you. I really enjoyed each of the characters, particularly Katie. I enjoyed how she was portrayed as a guardian angel sort of character who helped Epps discover the truth about what really happened aboard the Antonia Graza. Even Epps herself was an enjoyable character, Julianna Margulilies did a very good job at playing her character. I couldn't have picked a better actress to play her character. This movie has twists, turns, and jumpscares at every angle designed to surprise you and simultaneously scare the crap out of you whether or not you were expecting it. Even the menu for the DVD makes me jump. The cut-scenes have been edited superbly, it is clear the editor and director both spent plenty of time and money making this movie absolutely perfect which has clearly paid off. As for the ending of the movie, I must say I was not expecting it. The twist was unbelievable. I'm sure many horror fanatics may have guessed straight off who the true villain was, however I did not and I got a shock at the end. Shocks aside, this is the only horror movie I have ever seen that has not only gripped me with suspense but also gripped me with emotion. Parts of the movie were incredibly emotional and I felt myself tearing up, as some scenes were incredibly intense and surprising. The ending in particular made me very weepy and still continues to every time I have watched it since. Mr Frizzier has succeeded in captivating me and I'm sure many others with his beautiful music compositions during these scenes and others of which were accompanied by fitting music for a more modern taste. Overall, I'd give this movie a 10/10 every time I watch it. I would highly recommend the movie to anybody who is interested in an original ghost movie with a more interesting tale.",Ghost Ship
327,anglosax,Everything I've already seen before.,5,18 February 2006,"Following a normal routine of picking out random horror films my friends and I rented and watched this movie. While it didn't have the same number of gaping loopholes that many other horror movies have, and for the most part it was pretty well put together, nothing in the movie was new. It seemed like every idea in the movie was taken almost exactly from other movies. The entire premise of the film was almost the same as that of the movie The Haunting from 1999. Both movies revolve around a confrontation between outsiders coming into a haunted house and the malevolent spirit which rules it. In each film there is a benevolent spirit which seeks to aid the protagonists, who is incidentally in both cases a woman, in order to seek the release of their spirits from some sort of unnatural purgatory which the malevolent spirit created. Take the almost same story line, put it into the setting of the Titantic and add in some of the strange human ghost interactions from the Shinning and you have Ghost Ship. Even the ending of the movie is the same as Phone Booth (though that was released in the same year) both characters sitting in an ambulance seeing the antagonist is still alive and being unable to stop the further bloodshed they know will ensue. This movie isn't really a terrible movie. For what they did it was reasonably clear and concise, however nothing they did was new. Somehow it just not as much fun to watch a movie already knowing what is going to happen.",Ghost Ship
328,zfqhf5z02,Excellent movie,6,10 August 2005,"Have you noticed how trends develop in the movie business ? in the last 3 to 5 years they have made a number of movies based either on the rescue of ships lost at sea with no crew and passengers or on people stumbling on one. Seems like someone comes up with a good idea (or rehashes one in the case of the abandoned, drifting ship which is a true if old story) others must jump on the bandwagon.Anyway, about ghost ship....Starting with the premise that we've already seen a number of variations on this theme and they're becoming a bit stale now, GS is in fact a very good movie. Plenty of suspense and atmosphere, more gore than scare unfortunately but it has a plot loaded with nice twists to keep you hooked. The revelation of what *truly* happened on the ship, rather than the misleading segment you get to see at the beginning is an excellent example, and the end is another excellent if sad twist. I would not want to spoil your enjoyment, so if you want to spend an evening at home with pizza and icecream plus a couple of friends this movie will provide enough entertainment for all of you. If you are interested on this theme also look into ""Virus"" and ""Deep Rising"", the latter probably being the best of all three movies. If you are interested in the real story that inspired such movies instead, google for info on the ship called ""Marie Celeste"" aka ""Mary Celeste"", and you'll get various versions of the story, one more worrying than the other, but be aware that you'll find no answers to the real-life puzzle of the ship.",Ghost Ship

Having said that the movie itself seems to move along at a brisk enough pace the 3 times I've seen it so far. The acting is believable by all crew members and the story while semi-apparent from the first 20 or 30 minutes into it is twisting and turning enough to keep you guessing whats really going to happen next and how it will end.I, guess one of the reasons I, like the movie and felt compelled to write a commentary on it is that while I, love special effects and the movie does have them there not over done. Alfred Hitchcock was a master of not showing how someone was done in so to speak because your mind can envision more horror then the camera can convey and in some of the sequences your mind is allowed to dream up the suspense yourself by not showing what you know must have happened (aka the salvage boat captains demise) Then too for the people that can't get enough of the blood everywhere mind set there is more then enough of that also.In closing this movie is real good for teens and adults to watch with a certain someone on a rainy night and not something I, would recommend for a child",Ghost Ship

Juliana Margulies character flipped back and forth between Ripley from Alien and her character from ER. Alex Dimitriades realized about thirty minutes in his character was Latino and at that point changed his accent accordingly. Gabriel Byrne was completely forgetable (good news for him) and the rest of the cast was the same as we've seen many times before; Jive talkin' black guy, goofy stoner, etc. The beginning and ending seems like it may have been a good and original idea at one time, unfortunately the seventy-five minutes in between were predictable. A little girl pops up on an empty ship, oooh. Two guys sit down to eat a can of forty year old beans surprised at how good they are, you know what came after that. The little girl pops up again. After the slow timing and unscary and unsatisfying surprises  I could have cared less about the ending.

The only thing that GHOST SHIP doesn't do the same way, is that it's set on a boat, rather than an abandoned space station. Everything else is the same: the red dressed Italian opera singer/ghost, old rusty junk turning back in time, a crew of junk lords headed by an old dude, worms/crap masquerading as fresh food, banquets, heroes mistaking their friends for ghosts, etc.All in all, this thing is a disgrace.

Overall we found this film slow moving and tedious. There is very little action or suspense, the latter being a crucial ingredient to any ghost story. The role of the ghosts is relatively small given the title of the film, focus instead being placed on people idly walking around the ship dying off one by one in a boring meaningless way. For example, one of the characters gets seduced very quickly by a diva of the 60s,knowing full well that she is a ghost, unbuttons his trousers, tries to embrace her and falls through her down a lift shaft. The inclusion of Gabriel Byrne does not raise the class of this film one notch. He says about five sentences in the whole film and dies off-screen. In case you haven't already figured it out the girl is the only survivor and they're threatening us with a sequel (the only scary part of the film) in a scene that is reminiscent of the end of Phone Booth.",Ghost Ship

The beginning may be a bit slow and maybe even boring, but especially towards the end the movie it makes up for that.What I liked most about Ghost Ship wasn't the story though, but then such mystery stories aren't exactly my favorites anyway. The way the story is presented really impressed me, and that goes for the technical side as well as the script side.All in all I liked Ghost Ship a lot more than other horror/mystery movies I watched lately.

It's a great movie. It's funny, exciting and suspenseful. Just watching it once will make you want to watch it again. I noticed something new every time I watched it, too; something I didn't notice the other times I watched it. It's a great movie for people who like to watch movies that are funny and creepy as well as actually having a story. It's not like other scary movies where all it is is a bunch of people dying and there's no story. If you're up for a fun night with your friends, I suggest you watch this movie.",Ghost Ship
339,atticus22,Decent horror film,7,9 December 2007,"I brought Ghost Ship in a 2-part DVD set, along with House of Wax (which was the main one I wanted). I'd never seen Ghost Ship before, and didn't know what to expect when I put it on.I'll be honest.. when the opening titles rolled, I was thinking 'OK.. wrong movie..'. Then the gore started, and it shocked me. The director did a really good job of bringing you into a flash sense of security, then hitting you with the gore.The story took a little while to get into the actual action, and I found myself wondering if all we were going to see was these people talking to each other. The characters were typical horror movie people, but I kind of like that; over-development of characters can just take away the scare of the movie.Special effects were 50/50. Some were really good (the first gore part a definite good one) and some were.. eh.. not so great. You got the feeling the SFX crew spent all their time working on the big scared, and had to rush the other ones.The acting was pretty good. Particually, Desmond Harrington and Emily Browning (very good creepy ghosty turned helper to Maureen Epps).All in all, this was a decent flick.. it kept me entertained, made me jump several times, and even grossed me out. 7/10.",Ghost Ship

342,tudesta,Not a date movie - you might find yourself conceding to a chick-flick with subtitles next time...,6,17 October 2002,"It is the 1960's and passengers on a rather large luxury liner are enjoying themselves as they sail warm waters and feeling safe in the absence of icebergs. The mood is happy and warm - the music pleasing and smooth. Deftly the soundtrack introduces a somber tone and the visuals slow to accentuate the anticipation of some event that will spoil these perfect passengers' perfect lives - an event that leaves the squeamish cowering behind the palms of their hands and the fright-freaks grinning with glee.And so unfolds the opening scene of Ghost Ship - a delightfully disturbing introduction to the movie that makes you sit up and perversely willing on more.From here  it falls into formula. Introduction to an unlikely and unruly gang whose greed surmounts their sense of danger, gang meets boat, gang vs boat, boat picks off members of gang one-by-one and seems to be winning, sensible member of gang prevails (kind of). We have seen this theme many times already on boats (Deep Rising), spaceships (Alien), forests (Predator) and many other settings where the perpetrator is a ghost, alien, angry mutated croc or just plain angry guy.What allows a movie to differentiate itself is the storytelling, the characters or the scenes. Ghost Ship opts for the latter, but in paying lip service to the other two it somewhat dilutes the overall movie. Character development is rather thin as the audience never really develops substantial empathy for any of the main characters and the story holds no hidden surprises beyond the fact that it has chosen to follow formula.So the movie bets on the scenes. And to a greater extent it does a good job. Concepts are grizzly, set-ups are engaging and effects well-executed. What wins with the movie is that it is not gory - the demise of the characters is mostly implied rather than displayed, there is no major bloodletting and the body damage visuals don't linger on the screen. That is not to say that it wimps out in any way - in fact it has a greater psychological impact. However, even though the scare-scenes contain a healthy dose of fright and horror, the unfortunate thing is that the most impactful scene happens to be the opening scene and so you spend most of the movie willing the director to up the ante.The actors, many of whom are familiar faces, do a competent job with the script and the editors have managed to keep the pace and tension without migraine-inducing lulls which paralyses many other movies of this genre. The script takes a no-nonsense approach and avoids humor or witty remarks and generally hangs together quite well. Also to its credit is that it makes no pretenses about being anything other than an old fashioned shocker.All-in-all an entertaining movie - no life affirming messages other than avoiding rusty liners in the oceans.

How could she not have died while drifting in the water on a chest? The water is way too cold to be floating around for more than 5 minutes, let alone for a couple of days! Other than that, the movie was decent and had it's share of jumpy scenes but not too bad.

I understand the need for Katie to survive the horrific opening, but I have no idea ""how"" she survived. The wire cuts everyone around waist level except for the captain (and misses Katie)? And why not allude to what was happening throughout the ship? And why is it a requirement that the new crop of horror movies stress cool effects, but assume the people watching the movie are stupid?Secondly, the music. Did the movie really need to leave the period-piece music for a techno beat? It takes you out of the mood. I can only imagine if Kubrick used Doors or Stones tunes when Jack was at the Overlook ballroom.Finally, there are very few scary parts to this movie, so I have no idea how a studio can market this as anything other than a fantasy/thriller. I remember watching the trailer and thinking that the movie had a cool premise. Unfortunately, like 13 Ghosts and Darkness Falls, trailers are misleading.***End of Spoilers***If you plan on watching this movie, check your brain at the door or at least stop yourself when you start thinking ""How did that happen?"" or ""What happened to so-and-so?"".Rating: 2 out of 10",Ghost Ship
357,TeenCritic21,Highly Recommended *SPOILERS WITHIN*,10,1 July 2003,"I have to admit, the only reason I even rented the movie was because of Julianna Margulies. I wasn't even sure if I would like it but by the end I was so impressed, it became my new favorite movie. Filmmakers today ""try"" to make good horror films but they usually follow in the footsteps of Halloween and Friday The 13th and totally bomb! This one had me in awe the whole time with the thrills, suspense and even laughs (yes, the cast is quite funny). This is the best horror flick of the past decade!With an opening scene of people being sliced in half by a cable cord in 1962, I was disgusted but intrigued all at once. I not only wanted to know why it happened but who was behind it. In one of the next scenes, we meet ""the best damn salvage crew in the business"" lead by Captain Sean Murphy (Gabriel Byrne). Hard workers and very determined, the rest of the crew include Maureen Epps (Julianna Margulies), Dodge (Ron Eldard *drools*), Munder (Karl Urban), Greer (Isaiah Washington), and Santos (Alex Dimitriades). After cashing in on a boat they had spent 3 months trying to salvage, the crew basked in their accomplishments at a local bar. Just then, a Canadian Air Force Pilot, Jack Ferriman (Desmond Harrington *DROOLS*) approaches them with pictures of an ocean liner which he spotted in a flyby and convinces the crew to take a look at the ship. From the moment they set foot on the ""Italian art palace"" strange things happen. Munder falls through a floor, Epps sees the ghost of a little girl (Emily Browning), Greer is seduced by the voice of a dead (but sexy) Italian woman (Francesca Rettondini)  which leads to his untimely demise, etc. The crew soon finds the reason everyone on the ship ""disappeared"" when they did, millions of dollars worth of gold! After the crews' tugboat mysteriously explodes, they are left to fend for themselves on the Antonia Graza. They decide to fix the ship and bring it to shore. With a frightening twist of events the crew questions everything and everybody until the freaky end.I definitely give this movie 2 thumbs WAY up! With an all star cast, it will make you're heart pound and leave you guessing till the very end! I saw this movie many months ago and have probably seen it 5 times since then. I NEVER get tired of it. If you are looking for a good scare, I HIGHLY recommend Ghost Ship.",Ghost Ship
358,jumil,is this for real?,1,1 September 2003,this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Did somebody write this? could it be any more idiot? It does break my heart seeing gabriel byrne involved  in this project. the opening scene was rather interesting but soon one understands that the rest is not! Avoid this PLEASE.,Ghost Ship
359,frozenbiscuits,a sort of haunted Titanic,6,18 November 2004,"I'm not fan of the horror/ suspense genre, so that said, I kind of liked this film. I found it not overly gore filled, and suspenseful enough for my taste. I liked the idea of a sort of haunted Titanic. some of the language was alittle strong but not gratuitous.I liked the ending because it was somewhat unexpected. It's a ghost story. I supposed if you like gore, and heaps of graphic slash scenes, you'll be disappointed in Ghost Ship. I enjoyed the the way the clues to where the film was going unfolded. It was successful in not blowing the whole twist mid-film. I suspected something when thinking about all the little clues, but was still pleasantly surprised by the final scene. Horror film buffs may reject this film, but for those more delicate it was scary enough. I think it was well cast. besides I like Gabriel Byrne And karl Urban in general.",Ghost Ship
360,kam308,Screw you guys.,9,24 October 2018,Great movie. It's a must watch. Me my wife and kids have seen it many times. Awesome movie.,Ghost Ship
361,bscott-7,A surprisingly strong horror movie!,10,4 January 2004,"We bought the DVD without having previously seen the movie or reading much about it. It was one of the most pleasant surprises of late in movies. Very strong performances by the cast and well-scripted dialog, along with good effects, makes this movie well worth watching. It isn't gory and contains the expected amount of foul language given that we're dealing with a salvage crew. I'm a mother so have to add this last bit. I can also say that we have watched Ghost Ship at least seven times in the last two weeks. It's become my favorite!",Ghost Ship
362,Xpdnc,I rate this whatever-and-a-half. Emphasis on half.,8,9 February 2012,"Even though I saw this movie a long time ago, its images have endured in my brain. In addition to the cinematic surprises, it was in this film I first took notice of Julianna Margulies. It has been no surprise that her star just keeps rising. I must admit I rated this movie higher than I might otherwise have done simply due to the ingenious and unforgettable opening scene. It was Brilliant! And I really don't care that myth-busters has allegedly debunked the opening scene's premise. It will always be real to me. That movies and video games possess the potential power to destroy one's perception of reality is in little dispute. Because of this movie's first five minutes, the destructive power of cable is now revealed...",Ghost Ship
363,kod_113,"Boring, Repetitive and not Scary",4,15 May 2012,"From reading other Reviews I came into this movie with quite low expectations and I got what I came for, a Boring and Repetitive ""Horror"" movie that failed to deliver the scares.The movie had potential and the only scene in the movie worth watching is the beginning scene which gives you a false impression that this movie might actually be descent, But as soon as it cuts to the ""Present Day"" you might as well press the Eject button on your TV remote because all you're going to miss is cheesy acting and very linear story progression.The little girl in the movie, is she supposed to be scary? I don't know but she's anything BUT scary, for people that have already seen this movie will know what I'm talking about because there is nothing creepy about her, she's just a normal 10-11 year old with pale skin, nothing else.The ending of the movie ceased to make sense and leaves you looking blankly at the credits and wishing you had your 1 and half hours back.Overall, I give this movie a 4 out of 10, you MAY enjoy it here and there but save your money and do yourself a favor and miss this one.",Ghost Ship
364,cudambercam13,Gore done well,8,29 November 2016,"I was extremely surprised by this movie, mostly because of the flashback sequence, the music, and especially the massacre scene. I admit I don't have any idea how that could happen because I know nothing about ships, but that probably helped keep it unexpected for me. The victims' reactions were an eye opener, and leaving Emily Browning in the middle... Creepy. Her life end story line was interesting to me as well because it's not often you see that happen to a young girl, even in horror films. It adds a sense of how traumatizing the experience must have been. Back to the music, it's fairly popular for horror films to use a calming song during the scary scenes, but Ghost Ship gave it some additional flair, in my opinion. Also, My Little Box by John Frizzle was very well chosen. I haven't heard his name tied to anything else, so I'll consider his song in Ghost Ship to be a personal one hit wonder. The scene it was used in didn't hurt it either!",Ghost Ship
365,patrioticjesusfreeak,a haunted house flick on water,8,9 May 2005,"a salvage team meet Jack Ferryman (Desmond Harrington) who gives them the location of the long lost Antonia Graza, which has become something of folklore for sailors. Anyone who finds her, patches her up and takes her back to a dock not only gets an enormous stack of money, but also keeps anything on board. Little do the salvage team know that the ship is haunted by ghosts (hence the name), one of them being a little girl (i think her name is Katie), who is intent on seeking revenge on those responsible for her death, and the deaths of others. The plot thickens..... Overall an interesting horror flick with good special FX. The acting is pretty good, I have to say - especially Emily Browning. Set design was very realistic, and makeup was brilliant.",Ghost Ship
366,cisneyrebecca,My Opinion,10,19 February 2017,"This is by far one of my favorite movies. It's one of those movies where though out the whole movie it doesn't give the ending away. So when the ending is finally shown, it makes you shocked. That's how this movie was for me. Plus, the actors all do an amazing job though out the whole movie, in my opinion. But as much as I like this movie, I don't think they should make a part two. The ending did leave you on a little bit of a cliffhanger, but that's what made the movie so great. Defiantly worth a watch!",Ghost Ship
367,stevegoodwin-46781,Underrated not so scary film,9,8 September 2018,A great jumpy ghost film that actually has a great storyline too. There is no unnecessary gore and could pass for a 12A. Makes for a great weekend afternoon film. A classic.,Ghost Ship
368,bsh5999,An exciting and original movie,10,18 August 2005,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. No matter how many times I watch it, I figure out things I didn't get before. This movie is so much different than a lot of horror flicks out these days. It relies on the story, not gore. The movie succeeds in something else that today's horror flicks tend to lack in- they really get you into the character. You will feel attached to each character, yet you don't feel like you spent the entire movie learning about them. This gives an entirely new element to this movie, allowing you to be truly scared for the lives of the characters.A really great movie for anyone who wants a good, suspenseful movie, and it ready for some surprising parts.",Ghost Ship
369,hondaman94,"A good, entertaining movie.",10,14 February 2006,"First off, if you expect this to be a terrifying horror movie, you may find it rather disappointing. However, entering this movie without having really heard anything about it prior to watching allowed me to recognize it's qualities in other areas.The film is really quite well organized; the scenes aboard the ship can be quite chilling at times. Which is how I'd describe the feel of the overall movie - chilling, with several shocking moments and surprises but nothing overly terrifying. Granted, I say this being above the 'R' age limit, I would not say this movie is something to watch with children.The ship itself is very well done. I wouldn't say that it gives the impression that something terrifying lies behind every corner, however, aboard the ship it has a mysterious quality that makes it really quite unique. Even the way the ship was discovered is very creepy and mysterious. The set designers and builders did an excellent job of imitating ship design and architecture from the era, and even more so of giving the impression that the ship really had been there for forty years. The sound effects and dark corridors in the ship are excellently done.The acting in the movie was excellent too in my opinion, there wasn't really a weak character in the plot. While maybe not Oscar-winning, there are certainly no half-hearted attempts in here. Even the actors without a single spoken line contribute excellently to the atmosphere of the ship.Gore, save for a couple of scenes and one in particular, is limited. Which may or may not be good, for me it was. I don't feel that it is necessary to be overrun with lots of blood and guts to have a good, thrilling movie.Overall, I gave this movie a 10 because it is quite captivating. Not something that will terrify you, but I definitely found it to be an excellent movie that can be watched several times without becoming boring.",Ghost Ship
