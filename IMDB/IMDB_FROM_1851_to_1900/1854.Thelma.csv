0,MartinHafer,Well worth seeing,8,21 October 2017,"Imagine a film that is part Carrie and part The Exorcistcombined with a lesbian love story. I know that sounds a bit confusingbut this is a pretty accurate summary of the picture.When the story begins, young Thelma (Eili Harboe) has gone off to college and things seem pretty normal. However, out of the blue, she has what appears to be a grand mal seizure that lands her in the hospital. Soon after, one of the folks who witnessed the seizure, Anja (Kaya Wilkens) introduces herself to Thelma and they soon become friends. In fact, over times they become more than friends as both the women begin having sexual feelings for each otherwhich causes Thelma to have a huge internal struggle because this violates her strong Christian upbringing. A bit later, Thelma enters the hospital for testing to determine exactly whether or not she has epilepsy. During the testing, her defenses are lowered and her intense feelings for Anya run wildso wild that Thelma's supernatural powers manifest themselves. What exactly are these powers? And, what family secrets are there related to all this? And, how does this all end?As I said, the story reminds me of a couple other films but it's also original in many ways. It also keeps you guessingand that's the biggest reason I recommend the picture. Where all this is going and how it gets there make this a very special film, though I have a couple important warnings. First, there are lots and lots of flashing lights and epileptic viewers might have difficulties with this. Second, if you have a strong fear of snakes do not watch this film! There are several snakes in the film but one incredibly vivid dream that is nightmare fodder involving snakes and you need to consider this before you see this excellent movie.",Thelma
1,claudio_carvalho,Original Film,7,30 March 2019,"The lonely religious Thelma (Eili Harboe) is a repressed teenager that has just left her overprotective father Trond (Henrik Rafaelsen) and her disabled mother Unni (Ellen Dorrit Petersen) in the countryside of Norway to join the university in Oslo. She has no friends and one day she has an epileptic seizure in the library. Then she befriends the student Anja (Kaya Wilkins) and tastes wine and cigarette for the first time. Soon they fall in love with each other and Thelma feels uncomfortable with the situation that is against her religious values. Thelma is submitted to a series of exams to find the cause of her seizures and she thinks of Anja during the tests. When Anja disappears, Thelma learns that she has telekinetic powers. Thelma decides to return home where she recalls what she did with her family when she was young.""Thelma"" is an original film with a different story, great screenplay and magnificent performance of Eili Harboe. The top-notch and beautiful cinematography and camera work give a magnificent beginning to this film. The genre is hard to be labelled since it blends art, drama, mystery, romance, eroticism and horror in right doses. Give a chance to ""Thelma"" and you may have a good surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Thelma""",Thelma
2,lee_eisenberg,emotions are there,10,28 October 2020,"Several years ago, a friend of my family wrote a book about repressed memories. I never did read the book - it's not my field of study - but a good look at the topic is Joachim Trier's disturbing ""Thelma"". The protagonist is a college girl in Norway. Coming from a religious family, college is Thelma's first real exposure to the outside world. But things take a different turn when Thelma befriends a girl. You see, not only did some shocking things happen in Thelma's childhood, but she's no ordinary girl.The cinematography gives the movie a dark, depressing look. Quite a different impression of Scandinavia than we're used to. It's one of the supreme ironies that Scandinavia - always thought of as the part of the world with the highest quality of life - turns out these intense, disturbing movies. Which is not to dis the movie. It's a fine piece of work. The performances, cinematography, and music make this one movie that I recommend to everyone. It probably won't change your life, but it's sure to surprise you. I hope to see more of Joachim Trier's movies, and I hope that Eili Harboe continues to act.",Thelma

4,ferguson-6,a splash of Carrie,7,3 December 2017,"Greetings again from the darkness. Joachim Trier continues to deliver projects with his frequent writing partner and collaborator Eskil Vogt that cause us to take note of their intriguing and always (so far) interesting filmmaking. They may not be the fastest workers – OSLO, AUGUST 31 came out in 2011 and it has been over two years since LOUDER THAN BOMBS – but we can't help but appreciate their original stories and unique vision.A chilling opening of a father/young daughter hunting trip sets an uneasy tone for the rest of the film. We then flash forward to that young girl heading off to college. Eilie Harboe is excellent as Thelma, a quiet young woman leaving home and her protective parents for the first time. Thelma has had a restrictive Christian upbringing and she's now a withdrawn, socially inept college student, simultaneously anxious to explore her new freedom and guilt-ridden with every new experience.The school library is the setting for the first chance encounter between Thelma and Anja (Kaya Wilkins). We witness Thelma's blushing and uneasiness, and soon birds are crashing into the windows as Thelma writhes on the floor in full seizure. The girls cross paths again and the flirtations are followed by a heavy dose of Thelma prayers. This independence and sexual attractions leads Thelma down the ever-progressive road of dancing, booze, drugs (sort of), and sex – the only thing missing is rock 'n roll. An awkward dinner with her parents (Ellen Dorrit Peterson and Henrik Rafelsen) leads to more guilt and more seizures, as the two appear connected.Director Trier's film is not easily categorized. It's part drama, thriller, romance, supernatural horror, and religious commentary. There are some supernatural similarities to two films from the 1970's – CARRIE and THE FURY, and the abundance of religious imagery leans heavily towards the former. Some unusual camera angles and shots add visual interest to what for much of its runtime is an amorous courtship between the two leads. There is an always present cloak of uncertainty courtesy of the extreme helicopter parents and Thelma's unpreparedness in dealing with adult feelings. We instinctively realize there's more going on than the parents let on, but these are essentially quiet people who hold much inside. That theme carries over to the movie as a whole, which is a quiet, but sneaky film on the power of thought  both positive and negative.",Thelma
5,deloudelouvain,Good Norwegian movie.,7,20 August 2018,"Thelma is categorized as a drama, fantasy and horror but I wouldn't categorize it as a horror movie because there are no horror moments at all. There is suspense building throughout the whole movie but it never gets really creepy. The story is good though, intriguing, slowly building to the climax. Good directing from Joachim Trier. Thelma is nicely shot, clearly done by professionals. The cast was well chosen as well, as all the actors did a good job with their respective characters. To me it could have been darker with more scary moments to make it better but even without that it's entertaining and worth watching. Good Norwegian movie.",Thelma
6,christopher-underwood,Good looking film,7,30 May 2018,"Good looking film, clearly made with good intentions, but ultimately seems to lack conviction or even direction. I recognised tiny bits of the film and realised I must have seen a trailer some time ago that included the amazing scene near the beginning set in the university library when birds hit the windows and a girl falls into a seeming epileptic fit. Great photography most of the time, a wonderful and very believable performance from Eili Harboe lead us into a fascinating mystery involving drink, drugs, seizures and the supernatural. I don't now if the director had a clear idea of how to finish this film but I certainly found the end section most unsatisfactory, which is a shame because not only is it hard to believe but undermines much of what has gone before.",Thelma
7,lasttimeisaw,THELMA is Trier's stern-faced take on the thematic dissection of embracing one's true id and freeing oneself from any extraneous shackles,7,12 March 2018,"A sexually awakening meet-cute laced with a preternatural conceit from Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier, THELMA, his fourth feature, instantly emits an uncanny thrill through its preamble with a frozen river, a doe-eyed deer and a rifle surprisingly pointing at a young girl's head by her father. The girl is Thelma (Harboe), now an undergraduate in Oslo, but still in thrall to her parents' over-frequent telephone calls concerning her quotidian whereabouts, and her rigid Catholic upbringing doesn't quite chime in with her peers. Afflicted by epileptic fits, which mystically coincide with the presence of a fellow student Anja (Wilkins), to whom she feels attracted. Their inchoate romance hits an abrupt and unexplained abeyance when Thelma is under treatment of a triggered seizure for medical checkup. Guilt-driven by Anja's unaccountable vanishing, Thelma retreats to home and childhood tragedy resurfaces, and the film manages to find a way out for her with a confluence of sacrifice and miracle, garnished with a pinch of numinous enlightenment, which renders its empowering ending a puff of absurdity that might not be appreciated by everyone. Trier grandly sinks his teeth into fabricating an atmospheric eeriness that permeates throughout Thelma's rude-awakening, even in the prosaic campus environs: a luminous library assailed by an avian outsider, a natatorium where terror of seclusion and drowning taking a spectacular visual form with flying colors and Thelma's dormitory building, lit by nocturnal luster where eldritch menace seeps from within. Thelma's rite-of-passage, from religious and familial suppression to physical arousing, until a final mental liberation, is conveyed with eloquence (a cracking tantalizing sequence amalgamated with a bringing-down-the-roof trepidation during a modern dance performance) and innovation (metaphors and animal symbols are deployed in good senses, whether it is the deer in the opening, the slithering snake in the psychedelic mid-stream, or the black bird purged near the end), though one might grouse that the student's life is pedestrianly exemplified by a strobing nightstand, casual get-togethers deadened by alcohol and smoke. A convulsing (often in its literal sense) and pulsating Eili Harboe makes good in the center stage with both mettle and competence, but Kaya Wilkins's Anja is deficient in any thumbprint other than propelling the plot development in the mode of a hapless love interest, both Henrik Rafaelsen and Ellen Dorrit Petersen are swell as Thelma's conflicting parents, often muddling the water of the saint-or-sinner dichotomy. In the event, THELMA is Trier's stern-faced take on the thematic dissection of embracing one's true id and freeing oneself from any extraneous shackles, it is a bracingly crafted parable with one proviso, SPOILERS AHEAD!!!, that if one can live down with the key placement of a dead toddler in its moral conundrum that eventually peters out in its gnomic reconciliation.",Thelma
8,FeastMode,my notes,3,24 July 2019,"Dumb. very metaphor-y and symbolism-y. i get what they were going for, i just didn't like it. decent premise and a little interesting, but does not amount to anything for me. (1 viewing)",Thelma
9,MOscarbradley,"More ""Ordet"" than ""Carrie""",6,24 March 2018,"""Thelma"" has been called a Norwegian ""Carrie"" but Joachim Trier's film is a lot less showy than De Palma's shock-fest. Thelma is a young girl from a strict Christian family who develops a strong sexual attraction to another girl she meets at university while at the same time discovering she has telekenetic powers and the apparent ability to make people disappear. Unlike the De Palma picture, which was fundamentally a frightfest pure and simple, this wavers uneasily between realism and the fantastic, never staying long enough in one place for us to get a handle on Thelma or her predicament. Bizarrely the film it reminded me of most wasn't so much ""Carrie"" as Dryer's ""Ordet"" or even ""Breaking the Waves"" but unfortunately Trier's heroine doesn't have enough meat on her bones to be properly compared with these classics. Interesting but not much more.",Thelma
10,RosanaBotafogo,Adorable...,8,15 August 2020,"A good, different film, we live in the expectation of a 'suspense' and climax that does not reach its end, the rhythm now slow, makes it dragged and unattractive, excellent ending, a film that is hidden behind several lines, and runs away from the commonplace, so adorable ...",Thelma
11,paul-allaer,"""I know there's something wrong with me"", but what exactly?",8,23 December 2017,"""Thelma"" (2017 release from Norway; 116 min.) brings the story of university student Thelma. As the movie opens, we see young Thelma and her dad walking in the snowy woods, and when they encounter a deer, dad aims his riffle first at the deer, then.... at Thelma. Whoa! We then go to today, as Thelma, just entering university in Oslo, has a difficult time finding her way. Then one day, as she is in the library/study hall, Thelma suffers a seizure. Following that incident, Anja, another student, reaches out to Thelma to see if she's okay. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Norwegian writer-director director Joachim Trier, who previously gave us the excellent ""Louder Than Bombs"" (2015) and before that the even better ""Oslo, August 31st"" (2011). Here he goes a very different direction. Trier brings us Thelma, an 18 yr. old who grew up in a very conservative/religious/rural setting but now finds freedom in the big city and, while feeling guilty about it, is nevertheless quite eager to explore this newly found freedom. The movie is paced quite slowly, and I mean that as a compliment, as Trier takes his time to explore and provide full characters. After the first seizure, Thelma gets scared and confesses ""I know there's something wrong with me"", but what exactly? And what causes thee seizures? All is revealed in the second hour of the movie... I shan't say more! Eili Harboe is outstanding in the title role, and I can only imagine that she will soon be making her debut in US movies. In fact, I could easily see how ""Thelma"" is one of those movies that Hollywood wants to remake--Hollywood style of course. Let's hope I am dead wrong on this one. ""Thelma"" is 180 degrees away from Hollywood mainstream, and it should stay that way,""Thelma"" opened without any fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend, and seeing that this was directed by Joachim Trier was good enough for me to check it out. So glad I did. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so at best (6 people including myself), and that leads me to think this won't play long in the theater... If you are in the mood for a top-notch foreign psychological drama with hints of the supernatural, I readily recommend that you check out ""Thelma"", be it in the theater (while you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Thelma"" is a WINNER.",Thelma
12,billcr12,Cold and Dateched,5,1 November 2018,"I am surprised at the rating of 7/10 for this film. I found it tedious and detached. A college student is at school when she suffers from some kind of seizure and twists and turns on the ground. She winds up at a hospital where she is tested. Through flashbacks we see some strange things happening to family members, apparently due to her Carrie like psychic abilities. She is a loner, and another girl comes along and they have a luke warm lesbian encounter. More weird stuff happens along the way and without giving away the story, I will say that it was nothing new. Thelma is a below averahe horror movie.",Thelma
13,andrewchristianjr,CHILLY. MINIMALIST.,7,14 November 2020,"Chilly, minimalist supernatural thriller. Maybe a bit slow and spare for people who like more schlocky thrills. Filmed well, definitely more artsy than gripping.",Thelma
14,I_Ailurophile,"Fun and exciting, if familiar and restrained",8,21 May 2021,"We've seen similar movies before: A teenager, especially one from a religious upbringing, beginning to manifest supernatural abilities in frightening ways. That doesn't mean a fresh take can't be worthwhile - and to be sure, 'Thelma' is at once both exciting and unsettling.It's quiet, and understated, with tension gradually building over time. That suspense, kept at a slow boil, is punctuated by distinctly uneasy moments that grow more disturbing over the duration. To that end, writer-director Joachim Trier, and co-writer Eskil Vogt, have crafted some stark, vivid imagery to capture our imagination.Star Eili Harboe gives a rousing performance that matches, in its steadiness, the stonily even tone of the film. Where comparable movies might design a narrative to reach a crescendo, 'Thelma' is satisfied to maintain the same overall level of disquiet. And for every feeling of anxiety, terror, or discomfort conveyed, Harboe keeps the title character as resolute in her intent as she can be given mounting difficulties.The rest of the cast is just swell, too, but I especially enjoy Kaya Wilkins as Anja. The role may only be a foil to Thelma, the love interest that catches the protagonist off-guard, yet Wilkins gives a performance with an edge of calm assuredness that is eye-catching.And it's also worth mentioning that the ending rather defies expectations. Not to belabor the point, but in watching 'Thelma' one recalls films of a kindred narrative thrust. And it's typical that such pictures present a cataclysmic finale, a bombastic climax in which the world comes crashing down in one way or another. 'Thelma,' however, very pointedly avoids that temptation, instead offering a somewhat ambiguous and open-ended resolution to the plot that keeps the same muted spirit of the rest of the movie. It's refreshing, to be honest, and welcome. And I'd love to know more about these characters.As even the more jarring moments are generally downplayed, viewers seeking a more dynamic feature may be left a bit wanting. This is a movie that's more about atmosphere, and the journey of its characters. Yet at that, it's very well made, and the narrative keeps us engrossed all along. I very much enjoyed 'Thelma,' and recommend it especially to anyone receptive to a low-key supernatural thriller.",Thelma
15,truemythmedia,Remember Carrie?,6,21 June 2019,"Do you remember Stephen King's Carrie; the horrific coming of age novel about the sheltered religious girl going through a period of awakening that allows her to use telekinetic powers? You do? Oh, well, then you've seen this movie already. The fact that this story follows pretty much the exact same path as Carrie's story doesn't inherently make it a bad thing; in fact, I rather enjoyed this film for the most part. It was just that about halfway through this film that I started to realize that a lot of the beats and themes felt familiar, even if the events themselves were slightly different. There were a few twists that made the story interesting, and as far as technical aspects go there are some really impressive shots and scenes, but as a whole, I came away from this film feeling as if I had seen nothing new.For hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit True Myth Media!",Thelma
16,EdgarST,Tossin' and Turnin',10,8 December 2019,"Many years ago, being still very young and facing the imminence of a sexual encounter, I had a strange reaction when I was face to face with the object of my desire, alone, at dawn and in the same hotel elevator. It was like... soft but intense shaking, shuddering, almost convulsing. That reaction was perhaps rooted in the feeling of guilt I experienced a few times in my youth for having sex and besides enjoying it. Believe me: 12 years in a Catholic school was not easy! Things can be even worse, luckily not being my case, if you are raised in a home of religious fanatics - and I am not talking about extremes, like Margaret White, Carrie's mother, but of those people who welcome all the delirious fund raisings, processions, papal visits and ""pious pilgrimages.""I remembered that experience when I saw a similar scene in the first act of the great Norwegian film «Thelma», which narrates the drama of a country girl who arrives in the city to go to college and begins to suffer strange convulsions. It is a story of guilt, religious fanaticism and evil. However, it is not evil from supernatural beings or Satan, but of terrestrial, human people like you and I who live to make life miserable to others. Thelma has an incredible gift that she does not understand and cannot control. She believes it is epilepsy, but when somebody has an epileptic seizure neither the birds collide with glass windows, nor does the huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling of a theatre begin to swing.«Thelma» looks like a horror film but it is not, and at the same time, it is. It is not the vulgar horror that we find in mainstream cinema, nor in classics like «The Exorcist» and «Carrie», two movies that also contain in the center of their stories the duel between religious faith and scientific knowledge. Obscurantism, superstition and the magical thinking of all human beings are expressed in very varied ways. Thelma directs against herself all the irrational hatred of people who reject LGBTQ and sex education, when it is another girl, the lovely Anja, who awakens her sexuality. What a mess in Thelma's little head! It is more poignant because of her goodness, but little by little, she will find out that her ""problem"" goes beyond her love relationships.It is terrible, it is terrible and cruel that since you are a little girl someone comes and lays down the law and tells you that you were born with a goddamned ""original sin"". ""Whose law? Sin of what, now what did I do?"" In addition, she has to endure it until the end of her days, because there is no confession, communion or exorcism that will free her from the sin of the apes.",Thelma
17,OJT,"A beautiful filmed masterpiece with mysteries bound in belief, fear and imagination",9,10 November 2017,"Norwegian filmmakers (writer/director) Joachim Trier has made another great film together with Eskil Vogt. I simply loved Reprise and the last before this, Louder than Bombs. Oslo 31st of August is also very real though a sad story. Trier is a very promising director, getting better for each film released. But never has he and his writing companion Eskil Vogt made anything as profound as this masterpiece.Already in the opening scene this film grips you hard in the neck, and keeps the grip through. What kind of family is this? Why is the father so controlling? Is it something other than love?We meet young Thelma old enough to go studying in Oslo, but we sense that the family don't like to send her there. Thelma is a fragile, religious girl, from a heavily religious family, hiding some secret, or secrets. Moe shouldn't be told, other than it seem that when Thelma falls in love her burdens are too much for her. She feels profound shame about her feelings.This is a film difficult to categorize. It's a drama-thriller, with mysterious parts, and even some horror elements or if you like some paranormal stiff - if you chose that. Because the film lets you decide. What's wrong with Thelma?The film beautifully shot, with lovely camera work and angles. Some scenes are sublime. As is some effects. The CGI is also sublime. Simply immaculate, and totally believably made. Eili Harboe is excellent in the main role, as are the others.The film is very original, still it reminds in parts of other films with troubled girls, like Carrie and films like that.The film has many sides, all positive. It's exciting, mysterious, artful, beautiful, complex, mind-bending, thrilling, tragic, creepy and sensual film explores several different theories and possibilities, and makes you decide - What's happening to Thelma.Excellent!",Thelma

19,spookyrat1,Feeling Angry With God!,8,16 October 2021,"Co - writer/Director Joachim Trier's Thelma is an excellent example of an engrossing supernatural thriller, in which the fantasy elements of the film are never allowed to overpower, or distract from the compelling attraction of the mysterious, absorbing story. From the startling, quite disturbing, humdinger of a prologue, to the surprisingly sudden upbeat conclusion, Trier composes a.fascinating tale of a girl/young woman, both blessed and afflicted with psycho - kinetic powers.Yes, you'll get the punters saying it's evocative of Carrie. Technically speaking I guess they have a point. Both films deal with young women, trying to come to terms with their esoteric abilities, whilst at the same time attempting to emerge from the suffocating embrace of over - controlling, strongly religious parents. But they are so very different movies.Thelma is the epitome of a slow burning, low - key mystery, which deftly avoids the expected tropes of a fiery, special effects laden action extravaganza. Trier is far more interested in investigating the process through Thelma's eyes, of finding out the extent and origin of her powers, whilst presenting a realistic parallel romance of first love. And he succeeds splendidly.He is aided by a thoroughly professional cast led by Eili Harboe, who is outstanding as Thelma, giving a perfectly - pitched, restrained, measured performance. She is perplexed and forever wrestling with both her strictly doctrinaire upbringing and strange powers, yet convincing us, she is never truly overwhelmed. Henrik Rafaelsen and Ellen Dorrit Petersen in the vital roles of her parents cleverly give complete antitheses of Piper Laurie's celebrated deranged mother in Carrie. They are both firm and considered in their dealings with Thelma, only occasionally revealing their religious influences and even then we wonder whether they are really true believers.The film is technically, extremely well - made. The photography surprisingly (and thankfully for this viewer) is not too darkly lit. The music soundtrack compliments the onscreen actions very well and the special effects, when required are not especially original, but more than adequate.Thelma is a a moody, mannered, lingering coming-of-age story with Stephen King undertones, rather than overtones. It treads an expert line between the psychological and the supernatural and is highly recommended.",Thelma

She is capable of mysterious and ethereal powers, and more than she knows because her manipulative and fundamentalist parents keep such things under wraps in home-school.

The next day when Anja can't be found, Thelma has a sickening feeling she had something to do with it. She searches for answers to the secrets and powers that beguile and haunt her.This thrilling, deep, complex and sensual film explores a whole realm of different theories and possibilities. I was surprised and delighted by its twists and turns. It crosses borders between reality and fantasy, and light and darkness, and explores the good and bad in human nature. The actors are amazing, especially Eili Harboe as Thelma and Kaya Wilkins as Anja. It is fantastic to discover that the roots of psychogenic disorders go back as far as Joan of Arc.

Lo que he visto es una película crítica con el cristianismo más profundo de Noruega. Pero que nada tiene de terror, ni de miedo a no ser que el terror sea aburrir a todo el mundo.
La historia de amor, es larguísima, no hace falta tanta historia para contar lo que quiere contar. Llega un momento que no sabes si es de terror o de amor.Es una película lenta, demasiado lenta. El tempo es el típico de Bergman, pero ese era otro tipo de películas.Los actores, para una película sin vida, en la que lo importante es la pausa, si están bien. El problema es que ninguno me transmite ni un ápice de terror ni de intranquilidad, solo aburrimiento.La iluminación es muy noruega, no ya fría, si no sin vida. No me dice nada, salvo eso sí, abúrrete.El director, no me gusta nada. No sabe que sobra mucha película. Hay planos largos, demasiado largos. Hay planos feos, muy feos. Sobra mucho metraje. Aburre a las ovejas. Ve otra película y no pierdas casi dos horas.I thought I was going to see a movie of fear, terror, but nothing could be further from reality. What I have seen is a film critical of Norway's deepest Christianity. But that nothing has terror, or fear unless the terror is boring everyone.

The tempo is typical of Bergman, but that was another kind of movie.The actors, for a movie without life, in which the important thing is the pause, if they are well. The problem is that none of them transmits an iota of terror or uneasiness, only boredom.The lighting is very Norwegian, not already cold, if not lifeless.

24,ebeckstr-1,Flawed but intriguing paranormal coming of age drama,7,12 February 2021,"Very good acting and some compelling character development are this film's greatest strengths. The deliberate, almost meditative pacing is affecting, as is the score. There are many moments of quietude, and this is part of what makes it such an interesting twist on Carrie. They really are of two completely different kinds of stories despite Thelma being a sort of Nordic retelling of Carrie.The film's greatest flaw is the script's incorporation of that tired old cliche of fundamentalist religious fanaticism, which is such an old and boring trope. every single movie I've ever seen with this component and every story I've ever read that relies on it is weaker as a result. There are so many more subtle ways to introduce character and thematic complexity if part of what you're trying to do is include some sort of religious or spiritual dimension. Relying on the old and not-so-venerable fundamentalist Christian cliche means that the script misses out on some really interesting opportunities for greater subtlety and depth periodNonetheless, this is a very good low-key paranormal drama.",Thelma

Nope, just because a character says they love another does not make it a story. The actual relationship of the characters is as unoriginal of the woke generation and as any 'loving' relationship that the character has is completely pointless.
It is almost two hours of just talking and not establishing anything, yes she has some power, we are made clear early on, but so what, nothing REALLY happens.
Is it dark? Yes, but in one place. Does it finish with answers? No. Does it end like an American college coming of age movie? God yes.
It looks good and the acting is great, that doesn't save a movie with no actual substance. Me thinks the critics and lovers saw the name Trier and didn't want to risk offence.",Thelma
26,MovieCriticOnline,Black Swan meets Carrie with a little bit of Dead Zone,1,5 April 2018,"Someone watched Black Swan and thought, ""hey I wanna make a film like that."" From the poster to the feel, the story, the two girls, dual reality etc, this is an attempt to make a Scandinavian Black Swan.There is even an almost identical scene at the ballet (again, black swan theme) that is taken from the cab ride in black swan. But how did they make it different? why not a little Carrie theme? and sprinkle ia bit of the Dead Zone.Kissing, but no make-out, which means no tongue, just a lot of pretend kissing, which means lame (not believable).Unfortunately, this was too slow and boring. Apparently, some people are easily impressed these days. It was really hard to finish watching. Too many things did't make any sense and it was too predictable. The one scene towards the end went against any logic. At the boat if that happened to you, you would immediately jump in you know what.It needed a good editor and maybe it would have been more watchable. It was so all over the place and didn't know what it wanted to be.Skip it.",Thelma
27,gab-67599,Very slow,3,9 April 2021,"For me, this movie was way too slow to even enjoy. The actors were better than great! But sadly, the story did not explain enough to know what was going on. She had a brother but she killed him, she had a dad but killed him as well. Then she has a girlfriend and kills her, but magically brought her back to life? Was able to give her mother the ability to walk again, why was she in the wheel chair in the first place? She also said she loved her father and he was the only one she could truly talk to, but yet she left him dead. Why not bring back the two family members she loved? Why just bring back her girlfriend? Because of all these questions, I could and never would recommend this movie to anyone. Not even someone I wanted to get payback from and that says a lot right there. So ""Artistic"" movies are just NOT my cup of tea I guess, because I wish I had never wasted a minute on this movie. This will be a hard pass for me.",Thelma
28,Finfrosk86,"Expertly shot, well acted, but not the wildest ride.",7,13 September 2017,"First off. Some people are calling this a horror movie. It is not. This is a mysterious drama-thriller with supernatural elements, and just the slightest hint of horror. Now, I expected this so it was OK, but be aware. Expectations is a movie worst enemy!OK! So Thelma is beautifully shot. Thought has gone into each scene, and each camera angle. The movie overall is very calm, kinda quiet. Eili Harboe is excellent as the titular character. The other characters are good too, but she stands out. She has a very natural way of acting. Also she is beautiful, and so is Kaya Wilkins, which plays her new friend. Gorgeous people.Like I said, Thelma is a calm, low key movie for the most part. I did think it dragged just a tad in the middle part, but both the beginning and ending is pretty good. It has certain romantic tendencies, but it was done in a not annoying way. Good.The are some scenes with CGI here, and they are very well done. You almost won't notice they are CG, except from the fact that you know you are watching something impossible. That's good. Thelma is not heavy on big effect stuff, but the effects that are, are excellent.Joachim Trier is Norwegian movie critics golden child. They love him over here. Personally I'm no big fan, but then again, Reprise is the only movie of his I've seen, so I can't really say. But Thelma is the kind of supernatural movie movie critics are actually allowed to like. Because it's kinda artsy, ya'll! ;) Anyway, I liked it, didn't love it, but maybe I will later? I doubt it, but who knows! Know what you are in for, and you will probably like it too!",Thelma
29,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Combination Of Powers Never mash well!,6,25 March 2018,"Thelma Starts very Subtle and powerful, Ewoking that dark tone of
Carrie, Firestarter or that 1 minute scene with rogue kissing a boy for the first time. when thelmas uncontrollable powers
start shaking It has a more realistic impact on the viewer because of the tempo
and scene of the movie. Something missed from every CGI superhero drivel today
that makes haste skipping that coming of age story.
All Is well Til Its final Act. But then the director makes the biggest mistake
and loose focus on the credability.
Thelmas powers seems to have endless possibilities and are never
really explained except she has the powers of Jesus.
She can make people disappear and reapear and her dreams becomes reality.
she also have the same kind of telekenetic firestarter power and can make things 
move. And she can travel between planes. 
The problem for me with this Is that all mystery and suspense Is
lost cause of her enormous powers. All she needs to do is to wish people away.
So not even superman would stand a chance really. Her tragic story also abruptly ends there. she kills her family and that,s the weird ending.
There,s some good scenes throughout and are definetly a movie worth seeing one time, but won,t end up on my end of the year list.
The soundtrack Is also very bad, We have one great song from agnes but Its an old tune and heard so many times before this movies release so theres really not much here for me to find",Thelma
30,mcjensen-05924,Confusing Contradictory Nonsense,3,25 June 2021,The worst part of this movie for me was the eternal mindless conversations with Thelma and her parents. Parents who were overbearing prying evil morons. It's all just so far beyond extremely ridiculous. Every scene reeks of contrived drivel. The music was lovely. The countryside scenes were breathtaking when we got them. It tried to be many things and ended up being nothing. No payoff at the end either. Just a jumble of images and people acting in reason defying ways. Was twice as long as it should have been. Not satisfying.,Thelma

Thematically this is very much like Carrie, all the elements are there, coming of age, sexual awakening, religious upbringing, supernatural undertones, but all done in a different more ""Nordic"" way. Beautiful cinematography, very well directed and acted, technically this is a flawless movie. It does have a very deliberate slow pacing that might put some people off but for me it worked as it builds the tension very well and has a good payoff. Nicely done.",Thelma
32,mattiasflgrtll6,I want to see it again already.,8,25 November 2017,"I feel like in the future, I might appreciate this movie even more. You really have to respect the ethics of it. Odder, unusual movies are commonly only screened at festivals, so it makes me very happy that this is one that slipped through the cracks and made it to the regular theaters. This is one of the most unique experiences I've had all year.It revolves around Thelma, who grew up in a religious household and now is an adult living on her own. She's pretty shy and doesn't know how to talk to anyone at school. One day when she sits besides a girl (who will become very important to the story), she starts shaking and crows crash into the windows. She's having an epileptic seizure. But why?Once she starts to have feelings for Anja (with Anja showing feelings back) as well as drinking and smoking (which her parents openly have discouraged), her powers start to spiral out of control even more, having horrifying nightmares and weird visions.This is a very nice and slowly paced (in a good way) movie, but ""nice"" does not always equal comfortable. It will make you happy with emotions bubbling up in you, it will scare you one other moment and it will make you very sad. As the movie goes on it gets darker and darker, but instead of delving into full-on horror territory it makes you think a lot, and deals with Thelma getting increasingly emotionally conflicted. Why does she have these powers if they don't do any good for her? Is she punished by her sins or is she punished because she has lived out her life restrictfully? There's an interesting conversation at the beginning, where Thelma makes fun of creationists for believing the Earth is only 6000 years old, and her parents tell her she shouldn't make fun of what others believe and that she doesn't know much more herself about what created the world and what controls it. Thelma feels belittled, like she's been relieved of all sorts of independent expression. Despite this, she apologizes to her father afterwards since she's too afraid to break their rules, that she'll lose her love if she deviates too much from what she's been brought up to think.The romance aspect is handled very nicely. It doesn't feel the slightest bit sappy, Elli Harboe and Kaya Wilkins play their characters gracefully, and their scenes together are never bloated by Hollywood esque music, which would remove some of the subtlety.Joachim Trier also makes this movie look GORGEOUS visually, you often feel like you're inside of some strange lucid tangible dream world, and whenever scary things occur it's absolutely beautiful to look at.It's not suitable as simple escapist entertainment, but if you want something which will make you think about the characters afterwards, not just how well-acted they were, but them as people, then I promise you won't regret it.",Thelma
33,dakjets,Dark tale from Norway,9,5 December 2017,"Thelma is unusual, dark, partly creepy and surprising. The movie is difficult to place in a category, it moves between a drama, a thriller and has elements of horror film. This is a film's strength and makes it still surprising. The film is carried by young promising Eli Harbo in the lead role of Thelma. We will probably see much more of her in the future. What a great performance she does here. A young woman who struggles with her overprotected parents, and strongly Christian beliefs that are challenged when she moves to Oslo to study. I do not disclose any of the story, and recommend that you who have not seen the movie to read as little as possible about what it's like before you see it. This makes the movie experience stronger and the surprises in the movie bigger. This film is with all right Norway's Oscar candidate, and I hope goes well for it.

Whew.

Probably this is also one of the most curious and interesting because full of great imagination mostly visual that breaks the screen with penetrating and strongly incisive images that often make use of symbolic and imaginary elements, mostly religious, to cross metaphorically themes such as religion, in particular the Catholic one, the inner search for one's own identity and the acceptance of it, above all of its apparent defects which, if understood and managed, can prove to be strong points.
A labyrinth of images that enter in the head of the viewer that remains totally fascinated and therefore involved, thanks above all to a mature, serious and elegant direction that is able to perfectly mix the fantastic component with the real one, thus making the film extremely credible.
A pure film that fits into the mind of the public, who, in the days following the vision, will continue to think about it, wanting to see it again a second7 time.
In short, a great film that perhaps suffers from a certain coldness in various moments that goes against other moments that are instead very emotional because real and human. This contrast slightly affects the overall vision without, however, compromising it.
Special mention for beautiful cinematography, characteristic rather like in Nordic films, with rigid and very atmospheric colors.",Thelma

The depressing tone is there as well drawn out by the mystery and the ponderous musical score.I would have liked to give this film a 10, because of the main actress and all the acting, photography and mood. Ultimately despite the fact that it's totally mesmerizing, it's unsatisfying at the end. It feels like Part One and it seems to much to ask to continue the story.So I deduct a star, but it's a must see.and if by a miracle this is part one, then I'd have say it was willed that way.EDIT: After watching this film a second time I need to add that the director is very excellent.

40,shivamt25,Beautiful,7,13 April 2020,"Ones life choices are affected by a number of factors around us. One such factor is society and their customs. Religion is one such factor which defines many aspects of our behavior. Some type of behavior might be prohibited by certain religions. They proclaim it to be sinful desires. One can easily get behind it and choose between either the religion or the desire. But what happens with those who struggle with it as they don't want to believe themselves that they have similar desires.Thelma is the story of a young Christian girl struggling with the fact that she has a crush on a female student. Her life is made even more complicated when she discovers she has psychokinetic powers which create unexplained disturbances whenever she goes out of her comfort zone.I was eagerly waiting for this movie. The premise seemed interesting and the Joachim Trier's direction is refreshing. I loved Louder Than Bombs and Oslo, August 31st. It is evident that he knows how to portray complex emotions. In all his movies, the emotional upheaval always takes center stage. Similarly in Thelma, in disguise of her uncontrollable powers, we see how difficult it becomes for someone to suppress forbidden feelings. It's like trying to hold a ticking bomb down instead of diffusing it, hoping it won't blow. Because of it being a spiraling emotional roller coaster ride, the film gets darker by the minute. At one moment your happy, and then suddenly something happens which makes you sad, even scared in case of some scenes.The movie is visually gorgeous. It's intense theme is well supported a cinematography which is like a psychedelic dream.There are plenty of reasons to watch Thelma.

41,c-kelsall,Oddly misfiring parapsychological thriller,6,7 June 2019,"Thelma is a young university student from a seemingly repressive religiously fundamentalist Christian family. No surprise, then, when trouble ensues once she starts trying to break out of the mould set for her by her domineering and controlling parents. However, Thelma isn't like other girls, and maybe her parents watch over her so assiduously with good reason...
There are very definite echoes of Carrie in Thelma, although her strange power is quite different (one of the things which sets Thelma apart from other examples of the genre). Also, her mother isn't obviously a deranged lunatic.
Where Carrie succeeds better than Thelma is that, although in both films it takes a while for anything seriously paranormal to occur, the strains which Carrie is under are considerable, whereas what tips Thelma over the edge is essentially of her own imaginings and longings. It's also hard to see why, given Thelma's early life experiences which lead her up to the point of young adulthood, she hadn't done some of these things a long time before. In the interests of muddying the waters of whether Thelma is evil and in need of control, or whether the behaviour of her parents is instrumental in shaping her into what she becomes (which is ultimately the functional axis of the plot), the timeline of the story jumps back and forth in a slightly disjointed way.
The lead performance from Eili Harboe is fine; she conveys the sense of ingénue very well; slightly less convincing are the other characters, but I think it's because they are not written with enough depth for the actors to be able to flesh them out properly. The whole thing just ends feeling a little bit prosaic, except for Thelma's extraordinary god-like power, which is as bewildering to the viewer as it is to Thelma herself.
If the screenwriter had done a fair bit more work on the essentials of plot development and pacing, I think this could have been a stand-out horror film, but as it is I can only consider it slightly above the average.",Thelma

It contains everything from drama, mystery, supernatural elements, a bit of horror and is essentially a story about love, self-discovery and the fear it may be attached to it. It is a very slow film but the pace is even enough so it never gets dull or drags. The opening sequence is perfect and sets the tone of the film right from the very first seconds. All the performances are simply top-notch and photography stunning. There is also a bit of symbolism present so you will get your share of food for thought. The symbolism nicely compliments the film, it is not the focus of it and thus does not make Thelma a full on art-house film where you can't decipher or understand what is going on. It is very well written although it is very hard not to think of or compare it to Carrie since there are similarities.

Normally I'd prefer movies to carry a twinge of melancholy and tragedy, but I did not feel any empathy for the characters in this story. To me, that made it difficult to stay engaged or care about Thelma.The concept was cool. How it was executed was cool as well, but I expected the movie to chill me to the bone with the subject matter it centered on. Not so much.One of my favorite parts of the movie was the idea that she could create matter out of thin air. Abiogenesis. After badmouthing creationists about their farfetched (from a scientific perspective) Young Earth world views, her dad asks her at the dinner table if she had all the answers, if she knew how matter came to be...she says she doesn't know.Playing with the idea that she has supernatural powers, akin to a deity, but also has the mentality of a secularist, marries the two camps of christianity and science quite nicely.Thelma has a complex, traumatic relationship with christianity after all, so it's natural to assume she'd favor science over religion, but she also has God-like powers, so...yeah...it's complicated.Overall, I thought it was a thoughtful film, but it didn't excite me particularly.

This film is Mr. Trier's fourth feature length directorial effort, he also co-wrote the screenplay. the film follows a young woman named Thelma who begins to fall in love with another woman and soon discovers that she has magical powers.the camera work in this film Is very slick for the majority of the film. the composition of the frames are very well thought out and pleasing to the eye. at times though the hand-held camera segments can become distracting. especially when you've warmed up to the crisp and steady dolly shots and then transition into some shaky hand-held scenes. this however does not ruin the experience. visually, this film is very well put together.the lead performance is another standout element of the film. Eili Harboe as Thelma is absolutely magnificent. she commands the screen when she has to. the film isn't super reliant on dialogue so throughout many of the most important scenes Miss Harboe must conjure up some serious emotion and does so with ease. the inner struggle of her character is expertly communicated through her physically captivating performance. all of the supporting actors and actresses do a fine job as well, but clearly, Eili Harboe steals the show here. the film would not be as good as it is if her performance wasn't as good as it was.Thelma's character go's through a serious inner battle with herself when it comes to her own sexuality and her religious beliefs that are basically forced upon her by her family. this conflict is beautifully captured on screen in a VISUAL way. some directors forget that film is mostly a visual art form, but Joachim Trier understands this without a doubt. his use of visuals to communicate conflict are brilliant and artistic.the only real flaw I can think of when talking about this film is the final act. it seems like it heads in the right direction, then takes a sudden dive into a difficult conclusion that for me was hard to swallow.overall though, Thelma is one of the finest films I've seen all year.The Verdict: 9.0/10",Thelma
54,gphgrm01,"Interesting and fresh genre experiment, multiple gains",9,17 February 2018,"The film is a mixture of several genres. Coming of age and coming out story combined with family drama and horror. Some people say it resembles of Carrie, because of Christian extremism, but it is actually a side story, Christianism here was just a pretext to keep a girl separated from real life and usual experiences and feelings. But the best part is actually the metaphor of growing up in an unloving family, and being a neglected child. The film just shows what would have happened, if a neglected child could have taken (unwillingly) revenge of her uncaring parents. It could be interpreted as a tense and well directed metaphor of what is going on, suppressed, in a sole of the unloved child; child who has been convinced by her parent that their obsessive control is a substitute for love. Uncontrollable and forbidden love for a new person in life is a good challenge for the battle with dark forces of the unloving family. Its definitely worth seeing, for the fans of a tense movies which require good nerves and strong attention. Highly recommended.",Thelma

She suffers from several unwanted and uncharacterstic cellular actions that totally destroyed her life.These changes sometimes organic and sometimes mental..Those are beyond the limits of medical laws and equations..Only can be explained by some complex rules of science. This is where the movie stands extraordinary to me. As it slowly created the background where the plot has reached it's peak and then has revealed whatever thoughts and answers it can provide the audiences.

Where the former was dynamic, frenetic and wore its Nouvelle Vague pretensions very much on its sleeve, this is an austere, considered and meditative work of quiet horror. The full extent of its power is only felt in its closing passages, as the slyly domineering patriarchal presence is flung upon the pyre, and all the women are healed or restored. THELMA is one of those understated supernatural affairs, laden with all manner of psychosexual anxieties, in which the repression of female autonomy brings about a violent form of telekinetic revolt. It has some genuinely provocative sequences, deserving of the other Trier, but these provocations are never less than exacting and on point.

The movie is extremely watchable and I found myself not wanting it to end, desiring more of an explanation of how and why things were happening.
By the end of the movie we are led to believe that she seizes control of her abilities. Thelma's abilities are god like when you think about it, maybe Neo in the Matrix, but being able to control your own world and every detail. Is this all real? Or perhaps more a lucid dream......

And I was really impressed at what a good watch it is!The film is about a teenage girl, who has telepathic abilities, which were suppressed as a child, but awakened and uncontrolled, after another teenage girl expresses romantic interest in her. The girl being religious Christian, struggles with this attention. And as a result, her abilities are uncontrollable fatally.The film is a slow burner like a lot of people have written. But in a good way - this is not an action, or heavy drama, movie. I'd categorise it more art house indie/light thriller. And it is more focused around how this girl is trying to understand what is happening to her. Basically, her abilities are strong enough for people to completely disappear at will.So despite this film being a slow burner, it's still gripping from the start. And the main character arcs are written well.It's also nice to watch a gay themed film, which does not rely on sex and nudity. There is none in here. So it's a well written - cute, indie thriller.Reminds me of the Sofia Coppola 90s era of indie movies, with a foreign European twist.Definitely a film to watch on a lazy weekend evening.",Thelma
59,tstromsn,"Slow, boring and pretentious",3,30 June 2020,"It's okay if a movie wants to be different and try something else.
But this just feels like a mix of everything I have seen before, only trying to mask it as something unique.The pacing of the movie is also incredibly slow. Having countrless meaningless scenes with characters that we don't see againt or have nothing to do with the plot.
Every time something interesting or exciting starts to happend, it's abruptly cut and back to the boring and mundaine.This movie could easily been cut down to 60 minutes if they had removed all the long tedious scenes.At the end of the movie it at least starts to pick up the pace. But it's too late.",Thelma
60,TheDragonTrader,A delicious mystery thriller,7,11 December 2017,"I liked it. There's almost nothing more to say. This picture is ánd visually stunning ánd emotionally gripping ánd well-acted. It might look like a cross over of Stranger Things and Carrie from time to time. But the overall picture really is an original story! Furthermore, the music is wonderful!It's one of those few movies where – after seeing it – you can say: wow, that was good. And the great part is there is no heavy flattery needed to express it to other people. It's a story that is perfectly round. Nothing too much, nothing too less. Clean. A great experience.(Also, if you are held back by the description saying it's a horror movie... don't panic. It really isn't what you'd expect from a horror story in the original sense of the word. Of course, if hard core use of gore and jump scares ís what you're looking for, you'd probably be more satisfied with another movie.)",Thelma

Very well acted and good plot. Great acting and not a forgettable film! its clearly an allegory for accepting your sexual preference and being free to be who you are without shame.

65,Vinicius8,Shallow,5,30 August 2018,"Thelma allows too many genres in it, not focusing in one, but rather, blending them all together. Take it as you will: be it as a mess or as a nice mix.
Photography is undeniably stunning, much like Thelma's character, played by Eili Harboe. The actress does a fantastic job of carrying the movie by herself, as other actors are very forgettable. 
The shot at symbolism in this movies is incoherent and shallow. Most of what the movie wants to evoke, question and state, is already pretty obvious by itself, making the whole supernatural drama a unnecessary whim. 
There is little to be said about what Thelma is. It mostly deserves praise for how it is shown.",Thelma

68,raja_sarkar,Good movie,7,22 April 2019,"Thelma (2017) is a unique, bold, coming-of-age, slow-burn, supernatural thriller which retains its gravitas throughout its runtime and leaves a gnawing impact. The story revolves around a sexually repressed teenager who discovers her latent telekinetic abilities as a bizarre firestarter. The cinematography is laudable. The treatment is lonely and gloomy to a strange degree which makes it more of an indie-supernatural thriller rather than a mainstream movie. It manages to skip jump-scares and depends largely on characterization, acting, and emotional impact.

71,arunsrid,A wonderful film for the senses,10,17 June 2018,"I like films which are open-ended where there are unexplained events and the viewers are left to conclude who was right and who was wrong. I also love films where the protagonist is a bit confused, cannot take decisions easily, quiet, etc, cause I relate to those kind of characters the most. Thelma falls into both these categories and was a wonderful film to watch. I was earlier watching an Hungarian film called On Body and Soul, and while reading the reviews for that film in some website, I was recommended Thelma. I must say I'm glad I watched Thelma (thrice actually). Each time I saw this film, it threw different perspectives at me, and I connected with different people on each viewing. This film is definitely to be seen multiple times for a deeper understanding.

The style of shooting, the pacing and the editing really keeps the audience questioning the direction it's going in. I personally enjoyed the suspense of not fully knowing the genre of this movie, til the big reveal. I can't really fault this movie except one thing - the ending. I felt it was quite rushed, some movies like to leave you still questioning at the end but this one left a lot of big questions, questions that I felt a 2 hour movie could have explained. Would have been 10 stars from me if it wasn't for that, but other than that, thoroughly enjoyed experiencing a different type of movie you don't usually see in mainstream media.

75,rine_wolve,A super-villain's origin story?,10,7 February 2018,"Carried away by the wonderfully soft tones of the Norwegian language, I was lured in into Thelma's story, as she begins a new chapter of her life as a student. I felt everything with her! How lonely she was, how scared of her controlling father and aloof mother (while at the same time I did suspect that the parents were afraid of her), how torn apart she becomes when falling in love and then suspecting she might be sick... but then discovering she actually has super powers.
I loved the sudden turn for the dark, when you think her father might kill her and then the twist at the end which reveals the complete truth: Thelma not only thinks herself as better than others: Thelma actually IS better! And by the end of the movie she becomes aware of it, embraces it, and makes use of her abilities both for an atrocious murder and for a painfully condescending miraculous healing, just like a god dispensing justice on Earth. If that is not the display of a great future super-villain, I don't know what is. She kind of reminds of Magneto, although I fear she could get much darker in the long run.
I loved how ""Thelma"" leaves you longing for a sequel, and even a series. So much can (and probably will) go wrong. So, please! Let us see!",Thelma

The movie makes you ride towards a unique experience in cinema. This movie is enjoyable and thrilling from the beginning to the end.The movie talks about many things; family, love, youth, religion but those too many concepts somehow might lead the story to lack that punch to make the story brilliant and unforgettable.

The photography is awesome and storytelling is good, although I feel there was a vast space needing to be filled with more substance but instead the film's tended toward more mystery, and less toward casting light over the right questions. The most profound thing for me were the parents' actions. The comparison to other cases in the past wrongfully labeled or the insight to the epilepsy or epilepsy-like symptoms were a great parallel and insights in the others' struggles. It totally gives another perspective in the matter. This movie is the reason why I'm watching everything I can get my hands on next from the director Trier. (I saw that he's related to the big Lars).

First three-quarters of the movie were nearly perfect: slow and profound development of characters, tense mystery, an event opens questions. There were no unnecessary scenes or conversation The puzzle is near zenith. And then. Well... this movie flops. Last twenty minutes: the plot goes too quickly, an intensity of mystery-suspense elements is insufficient. Instead of increasing, the important elements are decreasing.

90,kickeeen,Beautifully shot with a thought-provoking story,9,3 December 2017,"Most films now-a-days rarely dear to be pushing the boundaries of the artistic form of cinema. Joachim Trier does this brilliantly by being able to make the viewer experience the same emotions the main character, Thelma, does during the whole movie.During this beautifully shot piece, we're taken through a very eventful period of Thelma's life and learn to know her whole backstory, which is thought-provoking to say at least. It's a coming of age story told in a stylistic environment with some well-executed acting performances which makes the characters seem genuine. The viewer is thrown into a whirlwind of emotions throughout the film and as told earlier, Trier is great at making the viewer step into the shoes of Thelma.The story is told in a beautiful manner, even though it might seem slow at times for some viewers. However, I reckon the film would've lost a lot of the suspense and tenseness it manages to create if it was shorter and/or faster, as Trier really lets us dive deep into Thelma's emotions.Do certainly not hesitate to watch this movie as you will not regret it. Even for those not liking this film as much as I do, it's still a good movie which does not let you down, neither acting, telling or shooting-wise.",Thelma

92,jamespremier,A plot so subtle it almost fooled everyone,9,2 June 2019,"Psychotically-induced seizures brought on by repressed sexual desires that include manifestations of poltergeist activity has been a staple of many horror movies. Carrie being an obvious well-known example.
That's what I thought I was seeing for almost two-thirds of this movie.
But kudos to the writer who leads us up this garden path, then throws everyone off balance, beginning with Thelma's institutionalised grandmother.
Yes, she displayed similar symptoms but Thelma's GP father had had her sectioned. The subtle reference from the nurse that the father was over-medicating her.
The film has already portrayed the father as a religious zealot who controls and dominates both his wife and Thelma through suggestion. He peddles religious purity through repetitious prayers and hellfire dogma and hints at demonic influence at work in his own mother and now his daughter.
The subtlety that other reviewers appear to have missed was that the father was responsible for the death of his baby son, for his wife's disability and the disappearance of Thelma's lover.
Once Thelma realises this, she rejects her submission to her father for his constant approval and focuses her ""gift"" to remove this evil from their lives. The manner of her father's death reflects his own hellfire beliefs.
At that moment of release from his all-pervasive influence, Thelma heals her wheelchair-bound mother and her lover is restored to her.
Her ""gift"" remains, but has now become a force for good.
A very clever, beautifully-made movie. But you may need to watch it more than once to catch the nuances you might have missed in the first viewing.",Thelma
93,yasinalpc,Breathtaking Experience,8,29 August 2018,"Norwegian director Joachim Trier had written the script and directed the movie. ''Thelma's story goes on in Norway. And we can categorize the structure of movie as a fantastic type. The movie has not shown harsh waves during the storytelling. However, the stream of the movie does not make the audience get bordem. Rather, drags the story well. While the movie starting it plants lots of question mark in our minds. Thus, hard to avoid those question marks to spread everywhere like a germ. However, when the Anjo disappear around those question marks turns into a mystery. 
Additionally, in the film has used color correction, and this movement allows the audience to be focused and entered the movie. Also, color corrections has given an artistic and positive look to the movie.",Thelma

It's fascinating how Joachim Trier, the magnificent director of this enhancing piece of art, is able to create an unbearable level of cinematic atmosphere with a mesmerizing sound design and a stunning camera work.
Thelma, the main character, is played by Eili Harboe in a very authentic way. Thematically the film deals with the inner conflicts of a young woman, grown up under the wings of highly conservative Christians and unable to adjust her beliefs to the modern world, which is the total opposite of the one she has known before. A heartbreaking confrontation with reality follows and the subconscious collapsing of her religious assurance begins. This mind changing rite of passage is depicted in profound metaphorical, repetitive scences.

But there are images I can't shake a week after seeing it (snakes, babies under ice, hair caught in the middle of a pane of glass). I think a lot of people misunderstand this film. My take, for what's its worth is that this is an art house version of Carrie. Telekinetic powers are unleashed with the sexual awakening of the main character, Thelma (that's pretty obvious). These are initially confusing and terrifying for her and she's horrified that she could possibly have made her same sex love interest, Anna, disappear into the nether. She goes to a neurologist to try and figure out why she's having seizures resulting in horrifying consequences. She ultimately turns to her fundamental Christian parents in her despair who explain to her she's always had these powers and that she killed her baby brother when she became either sick of his crying or because of jealousy over her parent's attention to him. Here's the part I think people miss. She kills her father before he kills her (he draws up a syringe for the act but ultimately puts it aside) in a quesrionably purposeful way. She then brings Anna back and heads back to Oslo/college fully aware of and in control of her powers, only slowing to heal her mother in the process (the mother is a paraplegic probably because of a suicidal jump from a bridge, years earlier, that didn't kill her). Anja probably isn't in love with Thelma, she is just being controlled by her. The ending isn't as happy as most here seem to perceive it to be. We know this because Thelma dreams/wants Anja to kiss her neck and then, moments later, Anja shows up to do so in the exact way as Thelma had just fantasized it. Anja is being controlled by Thelma and has no free will as this point whether she realizes it or not. Thelma seems to know her powers and how to use them finally (she isn't evil, per se, however) and isn't afraid to use them.Watch out ladies, you're not going to know what hits you when Thelma takes a liking.",Thelma

I was, oddly not to my surprise, a bit let down, and i think others will be too. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out and watch it!Harboe is the perfect choice for the titular character - every emotion is portrayed with the utmost of believability. Her connection with Anja feels natural and at times entrancing. If Harboe doesn't win an Amanda for Best Actress i'll boycott the award show. Just saying... The story in engaging, but slow-paced. I don't mind, others might. This is a beautiful piece of art, executed with finesse by Trier. The soundtrack is underscoring the action without adding too much drama, and you've gotta love every moment Susanne Sundfør's music is playing in the background. A perfect fit for this film. The screenplay has a lot of potential, but stumbles here and there. In a way i wish it had been a bit easier on the use of metaphors and symbolism, but at the same time i can't quite grasp what Thelma really is about. Visually, it's stunning - and that's not a given for Norwegian film. But film needs more than stunning photography, cinematography, characters, cgi and music.

109,strawberrylumps,Strong concept but somewhat poor execution,6,21 June 2020,"I thought this film had a lot of potential. I really liked the idea of having a supernatural and ambitious concept executed within a more low key and subtle format. However I felt it ultimately didn't deliver like I hoped it would. I thought our lead, Thelma, despite having these repressed powers due to her inner turmoil over her religion and sexuality, pretty uninteresting. I just thought the actress was kinda stiff and the character wasn't written in a way that made her likable enough to really root for. I also didn't find her relationship with her love interest very believable. I don't think they had a ton of chemistry together tbh. I also didn't feel like there was any build up to it, it just kind of happened. Looking back though, that could of been somewhat intentional by the writer to hint at the fact that Thelma manifested the romance with her powers without even realizing it. That brings me to what I did like about the film. I actually did like the ambiguous ending that made you question whether their relationship was genuine or not on the other girls part. I also thought the scenes when she was with her parents/flashbacks were much stronger and more interesting than the rest of the film. I really liked exploring the complicated relationship Thelma had with them, especially when she was a child and they were just finding out about her powers. I also found her revenge against her father extremely satisfying at the end after he they treated her. Overall I thought the film had some really strong elements, especially the ending, but I thought it ultimately could of been executed and written better to make it more enjoyable.",Thelma

great acting and performance from everybody and the way it's directed is just genius",Thelma
111,vikramvnaik,Thelma review.,8,1 August 2018,Liked this movie.Something different and the story opens up very nicely and slowly without one getting bored.,Thelma
112,AnaFatia,Different but super interesting,9,9 September 2018,"It's a different movie from what I've seen.
Something that I didn't expected but interesting. It keeps me always looking to the screen trying to understand what's going on with the character from this side trying to help her controlling the powers and her emotions. 
About the photography of the movie I love it. Spectacular lights, angles and details.",Thelma
113,braininavat-15118,"Incredibly well-shot, ultimately boring film",6,10 June 2020,"I will be less than exactly short and sweet: it's an exceptionally well-acted, slow paced art house film that lacks a decisive plot. Eili Harboe carries this film with talented ease and is a inspirational watch. I was disappointed because my expectations were based upon other stellar reviews which in retrospect were misleading. I would say this film is worth seeing if you're in the mood for a story that is beautifully shot and that takes time to unwind.Harboe is the main reason to see this film. I understand why she was nominated and won awards for her performance. I am simply baffled as to why some reviews raved about this film as a whole when it's difficult to stay focused upon over the course of the entire film. Again, my lackluster review arises out of often misguided expectations.If I'd been properly prepared for a slow-paced art house film I would have likely come away with a better overall review. I regret that I found the film ultimately boring--I wouldn't say my hopes were dashed exactly but then again I just wasn't in the mood for an artistically riveting, superbly well-acted fllm that would take such effort to get and stay into. While I did lose interest I still finished the film because of Harboe's performance.Scandinavian cinema is highly underrated--I just wish that I'd been in the mood for this type of film. Great Scandinavian films include my second favorite film of all time, ""Let the Right One In"" (after my first place film, the Iranian family thriller, ""A Separation"", which I cannot recommend more highly), ""The Hunt"", ""Troll Hunter"", ""Headhunters"", ""Adam's Apples"", ""After the Wedding"", ""Pusher"", ""The Seventh Seal"", ""Evil"", ""Insomnia"" and--of course--the Millenium/""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" series of films among others. I don't know if I can include ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" because they star famous Scandinavian actors/musicians but are are in English. One cannot go wrong with many Scandinavian television series including ""Bron/Broen"", ""Borgen"", ""Forbrydelsen"", ""Trapped"", and ""The Kingdom"".I know there are American/English versions of some of these films and series although I've admittedly never seen them. OK, I admittedly tried once to watch the Hollywoodization of ""Insomnia"" but was excuciatingly appalled. Five minutes was all I could take. Maybe I could include ""Lillyhammer"" although I don't get why the Italian mob American transplant doesn't learn the damn language. I lived in India for 3 and 1/2 years and learned Hindi/Urdu and love Persian poetry/culture so learned Persian. Keeping up Persian is difficult in the US but at least my fiancee is Bengali so knows Hindi. I happen to be American and am actually literate so I have no problem with subtitles if I don't know the language. Don't ask me why Americans are so literacy-adverse. Lack of curiosity and general laziness? Go Fish. I've been dragging my feet with respect to learning Bengali so maybe I'm no better.""Thelma"" just isn't an expecially gripping drama which is what I was expecting. It's best to know what you're getting into in the first place. I'd have reviewed it more highly if I'd been better prepared in advance. Can I say ""ART HOUSE FILM"" and ""SLOW PACED"" again?",Thelma
114,jaketruemper,Not a horror,5,20 December 2020,"This movie is NOT a horror movie. It's a Sci-fi that kills a baby, and by doing so most likely made a lot of people feel horrified.
Not a bad movie by any means, but nothing special.
A take on religion, college, sexual awakenings, and family issues. It's okay, and is a slow burn.
The story is solid, but nothing special.",Thelma
115,Code_NY,An unexpected gem,9,18 October 2020,Well crafted and wonderfully executed. It strikes the perfect balance in how much information it gives you without being pretentious or holding your hand. Great performances and likely to stay with you.,Thelma
116,maxrollason,"Dark, thrilling, cinematic masterpeice",10,19 February 2018,"Was lucky enough to see this at the BFI film festival. Incredible film, loved the visual effects and high level of filmmaking. Great dark, thick plot with a substantial amount of twists and turns. Exciting enough to satisfy a mainstream uk audience despite being foreign language. I didnt find the subtitles hinder the films intensity in anyway. Best film ive seen in a while, definitely worth a watch if your into cinematically beautiful thrillers.",Thelma
117,sunil_shety,Slow and boring,2,23 August 2018,"Slow and boring , not the kind that attract you and getting your attention",Thelma
118,Liquoman,Beautiful psychological thriller,9,24 September 2018,"The girl and the Swedish language is just gorgeous.
Made an account just to review this movie. I'm not a patient guy, I prefer quick comedy action. But this was beautifully shot, and during the ""boring"" scenes, you can think about what is REALLY happening. I'm a scientist, and the neat thing about this movie is that it could all be real, but you have to pay attention and really think about it.
Also, boobs...",Thelma
119,rabiakhalid-08009,Thelma,7,23 November 2018,The flow of the movie withholds it's viewer. The ending was quite unusual in an interesting way.,Thelma
120,sam_greenlaw,Swedes have Lisbeth Salander. Norje get this all-in Thelma,9,31 January 2019,"Lisbeth Salander and Thelma have things in common. Sexuality, youth, beauty, fire as a weapon, traditional Christianity as a serious moral resource. And more. Neither sleeps soundly.But where Dragon Tattoo yields ripping action films, this first Thelma catches the character where she understands nothing. She is on her own at college in Oslo. She gets apparent seizures.She has to deal on her own initially with becoming not one step shy a god. (She is not malevolent. When she has a nightmare, to be sure all bets are off.)Reviews complain that the story takes too long. Seems to me every frame of every scene carries a storytelling burden. Trier did good. This is as dense as it gets. If you think you hit a dead frame, you missed something.Eili looks to be Norway's Rooney. Brilliant. Alive. A natural. They could be sisters.",Thelma
