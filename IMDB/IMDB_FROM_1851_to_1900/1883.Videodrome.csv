0,MartinHafer,I just couldn't finish this one....,1,14 April 2017,"I do understand in some ways what the film was trying to say. I also know that it's been praised and many consider it an exceptional film. However, I tried watching it tonight and ended up turning it off about halfway through the movie. Why? Because the extremely violent images were very disturbing...especially because I am sure folks enjoyed watching this. You see folks being tortured, a woman getting off with some VERY realistic masochistic behaviors (involving needles, burning herself and more) and after a while it just was too much. And, at that point I just said to myself...'how much of this can I take and SHOULD I even keep watching?'. Seeing folks brutalized just isn't my cup of tea...especially when it's combined with pornographic images and sex. Perhaps I am too squeamish, but life is too short for me to fill my mind with such stuff and I do not plan on trying to watch this one again...once was enough...so you are forewarned.",Videodrome
1,TheLittleSongbird,Flesh long unsettlement,7,12 April 2019,"David Cronenberg's films are technically very well made and while his films are very disturbing a good deal of his films also have either a dark or subtle wit, poignant emotion or even both. He is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors, despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that. All these are the reasons for my admiration and appreciation for him.Will be honest in saying that 'Videodrome' is not quite one of my favourites of his, do much prefer the likes of 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly' and find that they are more accessible as films. It is still a very intriguing film that hits hard on the disturbance factor. Something of a transition film, with all the distinctive Cronenberg touches and themes but now exploring more ambitious concepts, on top of being one of his most disturbing 'Videodrome' is also one of his most personal and most complex.'Videodrome's' weak links really are the story and pace in the latter stages. The story starts off very interesting and much of the film is unsettling in atmosphere, but in the latter stages it does start to unravel and the more it does the less sense it makes and more muddled it gets until the viewer is completely lost.As the story unravels, the pace does too, meandering until it becomes exhausting when things get on the over-the-top side.However, as always with Cronenberg, 'Videodrome' is a very accomplished looking film. It boasts some of the most startling imagery of any Cronenberg film (in a way that is both disturbing and also oddly beautiful), Cronenberg again showing his visual mastery even if the techniques became even more refined in his later work, as can be seen with 'The Fly' and 'Dead Ringers'. Howard Shore's, a Cronenberg regular, score is deeply haunting while also with a degree of emotion, not just going for full on horror but also the emotional core.Script may not have as much dark wit or poignancy as other Cronenberg films, but it probes the mind at least and flows well. Much of the film is truly unnerving and makes one think twice about the future of media, the tension there frequently. Cronenberg directs with a typically adept touch. The characters carry 'Videodrome', Max is a sleazeball and is a meaty one at that. The acting is very good, with the driving force being James Woods giving a lead performance of true ferocity.Overall, good if not one of my favourites of Cronenberg. 7/10",Videodrome
2,Leofwine_draca,The master of the grotesque at his most delightfully weird,7,27 November 2016,"Wow! After the highs of Scanners, Cronenberg delivers a much different movie in which Baker's special effects merely complement the story. It's certainly one of Cronenberg's weirdest movies, considering that it involves kinky sex, bizarre hallucinations, and a national conspiracy to control the public. Yet these factors and more combine to make VIDEODROME a unique, compelling, and ultimately disturbing movie with a wonderful premise.James Woods is on top form once again (does this man ever give a bad performance?) as the seedy boss of a cable show who's always looking for new kicks. In this day and age, softcore pornography isn't enough and Woods wants something harder. Into his life comes the alluring Debbie Harry, who seduces him by stubbing out a cigarette on her breast. However, soon she is gone again and Woods is left alone in his apartment to become obsessed and hypnotised by the disturbing video tapes he has in his possession.The first notable special effect shows a video cassette pulsating and is completely shocking and unexpected. Things get more and more elaborate from here. Woods' television set becomes a living, breathing organism and he manages to stick his head through the screen before waking up the next morning, his mind a mess. Throughout the film, wilder things happen, like Woods sticking a gun and then a tape into a cavity in his stomach. In the end it turns out that it's all part of a plan for public domination and that Woods is a test subject.There are some great characters in this film to support the excellent Woods in his lead. I especially liked Brian O'Blivion, a character who communicates only through the television screen. Elsewhere we have a nerdish associate of Woods, a pushy secretary, and the creepy proprietor of the show. Things culminate in some astonishing bloody scenes at the end which are often jaw-dropping. Seen today, Cronenberg's film seems quite prophetic in detailing how television can be used to control a nation and the importance it plays in our lives. The idea is sound and if viewers can get over the abstract, complex nature of the film then I'm sure they'll find themselves enjoying it. VIDEODROME is certainly a clever, shocking and disturbing horror movie with an original idea and fine execution from the master of the grotesque.",Videodrome
3,SnoopyStyle,both visual and philosophical surrealism,8,9 January 2015,"Sleazy Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of Channel 83 in Toronto. He is always looking for edgy material and discovers an underground channel Videodrome that seems to be showing real torture and death. His radio personality girlfriend Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry) is turned on by the show. Then he finds out that the channel is actually coming from Pittsburg. Professor O'Blivion is a media philosopher who runs the Cathode Ray Mission and connects him to the world of Videodrome.This movie is filled with fascinating ideas, both visual and philosophical. It is out there surreal. It is uncomfortable and titillating at times. It touches on the grotesque and the immoral. The surrealism can get undecipherable towards the end. At that point, it's better to allow the weirdness to wash away any thoughts of logic.",Videodrome
4,Prismark10,Out of the picture,6,24 June 2014,"Videodrome was always controversial on its release but then again David Cronenberg films usually are. He was a director who brought a fresh spin to horror on a low budget but in a chilly and detached way. His films also tend to have a political subtext. Here the press fury was caused more by Debbie Harry appearing nude and the subject of snuff videos which was a moral panic in the early 1980s.Of course the film has aged especially as it was made over 30 years ago. If Cronenberg had gone down the road of George Lucas and remastered the film it would be retitled as DVDdrome and even that would now be old hat.The film sees James Woods as a sleazy cable TV programmer who seeks out bad taste productions and finds himself seeing a snuff video which gives him bizarre visions. He finds out that he has been re- programmed via these violent videos by some right wing conglomerate who want him to carry out assassinations.A character asks Woods why would someone want to see a person get tortured or killed on camera and Woods is unable to answer it. However it is a relevant question. Fast forward 30 years and snuff movies is not some urban legend, it is reality. You can YouTube decapitations, executions, torture. Footage of death and maiming in war zones are commonplace. People will show each other clips on their Smartphones and laugh about it. I avoid such footage, the victim has not given permission that their death is used for entertainment value, to be passed round between strangers in a viral world. There was once a living person, good or bad with friends and family, now a brutalised corpse.I guess Videodrome was ahead of its time and maybe that is the message Cronenberg was making.",Videodrome
5,claudio_carvalho,The Television Screen Is the Retina of the Mind's Eye,7,22 August 2006,"The president of the Civic TV - channel 83, Max Renn (James Wood), is always looking for new cheap and erotic movies for his cable television. When his employee Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) decodes a pirate video broadcast showing torture, murder and mutilation called Videodrome, Max becomes obsessed to get these movies for his channel. He contacts his supplier Masha (Lynne Gorman) and asks her to find the responsible for the transmission. A couple of days later, Masha tells that Videodrome is real, actually snuff movies. Max's sadomasochist girlfriend Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry) decides to travel to Pittsburgh to have an audition to the show. Max investigates further, and through a video of the expert Professor Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley), he learns that that TV screen would be the retina of the mind's eye, being part of the brain, and Videodrome transmission creates a brain tumor in the viewer, changing the reality in video hallucination.""Videodrome"", in my point of view, is a prophetic movie of David Cronenberg. The first time I saw this movie was in 1985 or 1986, when video-clubs where novelty in Brazil, and the local price of a videocassette was more than US$ 650.00. In that occasion, I recall that I was visually impressed with this gore, weird and bizarre movie. Twenty-three years later, I have just seen it on DVD and I realize the vision of this great director. He was able to foresee the importance of television for mankind, influencing people with sublimated messages, manipulating audiences and becoming very powerful, and how violence on screen can generate violence. I particularly like the following quotes: ""The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye"" and ""Television is reality, and reality is less than television."" Last but not the least, Brazil is not located in Central America, but in South America. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Videodrome  A Síndrome do Vídeo"" (""Videodrome  The Syndrome of the Video"")",Videodrome
6,gavin6942,A Mind-Altering Film From Canada (For Lack of Better Headline),10,28 November 2006,"Max Renn (James Woods) stumbles across a pirated station broadcasting ""Videodrome"", a program of torture and murder. It begins to take center stage in his life, along with a sado-masochistic woman (Blondie's Debbie Harry) and a professor who only appears as a series of video cassettes.The more David Cronenberg I watch, the more I love this man. ""Stereo"", ""The Brood"", ""Naked Lunch"" and ""History of Violence""... all great. ""Rabid"" was decent. And here we have what I believe is considered his magnum opus, ""Videodrome"", and I agree -- there has never been a film like this and never will be again, which I mean in the nicest way.Max Renn slowly stumbles into a world of bizarre people and bizarre situations (obviously unaware he was in a Cronenberg film, or he'd have expected this) and his hallucinations take on a life of their own. As the professor character (Brian O'Blivion) says, what is more reality than the perception of reality (I'm paraphrasing)? What Max sees is now real.These delusions and the reality of them is what really drives the film. In one scene we are made aware a vision of his is obviously false, as no one else can see what he is seeing. But in other moments, the line is blurred and we are left assuming the fantastic has become possible. And as we see all of this from Max's point of view, we know no more than he does as to what is really going on.James Woods is a great actor, no one would deny him that. And this film gives him the opportunity to really stretch his acting muscles, being both a protagonist and a mental case. And, as he points out to Peter Griffin on ""Family Guy"", he shows his butt in one scene. (Debbie Harry shows more than that for those who are looking for such thrills.) I could draw parallels between this and ""Altered States"", which is the only other film that comes to mind where a man enters a whole new reality in this fashion... a farewell to the flesh. If I tried, I could also summon ""The Ring"", as both feature video cassettes that have the power to kill the viewer (one more literally than the other).Watch this film, share the vision of Cronenberg. His talents as a writer and director shine here, not to mention the clever devices and makeup that were used... he is a true film maker who takes the impossible and makes it happen, not like the other so-called masters who have lost their way. David Cronenberg is the real deal and ""Videodrome"" is his masterpiece.",Videodrome
7,lee_eisenberg,descent into cathode madness,8,25 December 2011,"If you've seen any David Cronenberg movie, you should know that they always contain at least one REALLY nasty scene. ""Videodrome"" is no different. James Woods plays the owner of a sleazy TV station in Toronto that starts airing ultra-violent porn flicks...but how much is fiction and how much is real? And what's actually the purpose of Videodrome? Obviously, there are some scenes that test how much you're willing to watch. However, there are also some really cool scenes with the TV sets. Overall, the movie seems more relevant than ever: a lot of pop culture these days is all about shock value, to the point that people grow more and more desensitized to violence. Anyway, I thought that it was a good movie.So yes, long live the new flesh.",Videodrome
8,jboothmillard,Videodrome,6,21 November 2006,"The only reason I heard of this film is because it is in a book I read called 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, being from director by David Cronenberg (Scanners, The Fly, Dead Ringers, Crash), I was hoping it to be worthwhile. Basically Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV (Channel 83, Cable 12), a sleazy television station specialising in sensationalist programming, Renn is always looking for new cheap and erotic shows and movies to broadcast. Max's employee Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) has decoded a pirate video broadcast showing torture, murder and mutilation, it is called ""Videodrome"" (the title resembling hippodrome), Max is most interested to broadcast this for his channel and becomes obsessed with finding the series. Max contacts his supplier, softcore pornographer Masha (Lynne Gorman), and asks her to find the party responsible for the transmission, she initially warns him that it is dangerous, and a couple of days later she tells Max that ""Videodrome"" is real, they are snuff movies. Max has been experiencing hallucinogenic trips, including the video tape coming to life and strange things appearing and happening in his apartment and at work. The show is based in Pittsburgh, Max's sado-masochistic girlfriend Nicki Brand (Blondie's Deborah ""Debbie"" Harry) decides to travel there to audition, meanwhile following his own viewing of ""Videodrome"". Investigating further Max finds out through a video featuring media prophet Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley) that TV screens are the retina of the mind's eye, being part of the brain, and ""Videodrome"" transmissions create a brain tumour in the viewer, changing the reality through video hallucination, and in the end it looks like Max cannot handle it and kills himself. Also starring Sonja Smits as Bianca O'Blivion, Leslie ""Les"" Carlson as Barry Convex, Julie Khaner as Bridey, Reiner Schwartz as Moses, David Bolt as Raphael and Lally Cadeau as Rena King. Woods is alright as the lowlife amoral cable programmer, and Harry is interesting as his odd girlfriend, there is only a little bit of a story that you can follow, it is most memorable for the bizarre and surreal things going on, high amount of gory violence and voyeuristic sexual activity, it is a most disturbing science-fiction horror film. Good!",Videodrome
9,Woodyanders,Make way for the New Flesh,9,14 December 2017,"Sleazy small-time TV programmer Max Renn (James Woods in top slimy form) discovers an extremely brutal new show called Videodrome that proves to be all too realistic. Pretty soon Renn finds himself caught up in a nebulous and perilous alternate world of kinky sex, sadistic violence, and deadly political conspiracies. Writer/director David Cronenberg offers a trenchant and uncannily prophetic critique of the media's potentially toxic and damaging influence on people's minds, with a specific emphasis on how the sensory overload from said media can beget a dangerous blurring of the fine line that separates reality from fantasy. Moreover, Cronenberg predicts with alarming accuracy certain aspects of the early 21st century which include the rise in popularity of harsh BDSM adult websites like Kink.com and an advanced technological landscape where everyone has a special name (hmm, that sounds kind of like the internet, now doesn't it?). Debbie Harry makes a favorable impression as the slinky and enticing Nicki Brand, Sonja Smits registers well as the shrewd Bianca O'Blivion, Les Carlson positively oozes as the duplicitous Barry Convex, and Peter Dvorsky smarms it up nicely as no-count pirate Harlan. Kudos also are in order for Mark Irwin's polished cinematography, Howard Shore's spare chilling score, and Rick Baker's strikingly grotesque make-up f/x. The New Flesh lives on!",Videodrome
10,rmax304823,Long Live the Videoflesh!,3,8 September 2012,"Meritricious trash. It seems to have been made with the sole purpose in mind of making the viewer's skin crawl. There is some nebulous idea tacked on, something about television rotting the brain or something.It isn't that David Cronenberg hasn't ever made a decent and thought-provoking film. He did, with ""Dead Ringers."" But as a director he falls in the same class as Brian DePalma, who made the gripping ""Casualties of War"" and otherwise has done nothing but imitate Alfred Hitchcock until, finally, he got around to imitating himself.James Woods runs a shabby television station in Toronto and one day his assistant picks up an illegal broadcast from Malaya. It shows nothing but torture porn. It strikes Wood that this could be a commercially successful idea. It's kind of exciting to watch actresses being whipped and strangled.So he investigates and the plot begins to thicken. The broadcasts are being routed through Maylaya but originate right here in Toronto. Then the plot gets clotted. The whole idea was dreamed up by a Dr. O'Blivion who only appears on television, never in real life, because in fact he died of a brain tumor that was induced by too much TV-watching. I swear I'm not making that up.After that the plot decomposes completely and you can't tell the hallucinations from the genuine events. That's a splendid cinematic trick, by the way, if you're looking for an excuse to have one fantastic and emetic thing happen after another. Woods shoots and kills one of Dr. O'Blivion's agents on a public stage and the guy doesn't simply die after receiving four or five bullets. He falls to the stage, his body splits open, his teeth pop out, an various sponge-like objects spring from cavities in his had and torso. Is this one of Woods' hallucinations? Was it a real event? Who knows? Who cares? Not the normal members of the community in which this takes place, if it takes place at all. Hundreds of people have just watched a man shot and turned into a bloody sponge and nothing more is heard of it. You won't care either, not if you enjoy the movie, because the whole point is the exercise of computer-generated effects. The murders are incidental.I thought the film was a little disgusting in a literal sense but it seems a number of people thought it was an outstanding piece of entertainment, unless I hallucinated the rating here. You know something? I wonder if it ever occurred to Cronenberg that if our minds are so heavily influenced by what we watch on the screen, then this isn't helping us grow up.",Videodrome
11,Tweekums,Classic body-horror from David Cronenberg,8,9 November 2015,Protagonist Max Renn runs the sleazy Channel 83 in Toronto and is constantly on the lookout for the next thing. Then one of his employees shows him something strange; a satellite broadcast known as Videodrome that appears to show torture and murder. At first they can only lock onto the signal for a minute and believe it is being broadcast from Malaysia later they learn it is actually coming from Pittsburgh! Soon after he first sees Videodrome he starts to hallucinate and from then on it is hard to know what is real and what he is imagining. In what follows we see a strange opening appear in Max's abdomen; he later inserts Betamax tapes into this slot. He investigates the company behind Videodrome and learns that it is a plot to effect everybody will he be turned into their pawn or will he destroy Videodrome?This is definitely a very strange film; indeed for much of the time we don't know if what we are seeing is actually what is happening or if it is just part of the hallucination; in fact there are parts that look as if they are meant to be real but we are later told weren't of course there is no way of knowing if that later information is real or not! It might sound very confusing but it isn't it almost doesn't matter if what we see is meant to be real that is the point of Videodrome. While there are only a few scenes that would qualify as a bit gross there are several disturbing moments. The pre-CGI special effects are impressive and add to the films strangeness most notably the strange slot that appears in Max's abdomen and the way a gun fuses to his hand and becomes part of him. James Woods does a fine job portraying Max Renn as things get weirder and weirder; making us believe that the character believes in what he is happening to him. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film if only for its weirdness; there are some disturbing moments but nothing that is likely so offend horror fans.,Videodrome
12,BA_Harrison,Can you cope?,7,8 August 2009,"'I just can't cope with the freaky stuff' says Videodrome's Barry Convex as James Woods' Max Renn begins yet another series of horrific hallucinations. At times, I know just how he feels: this visceral, mind-bending piece of surrealistic sci-fi from David Cronenberg is totally absorbing, but doesn't half mess with the head, plunging viewers into a strange world where reality blends seamlessly with the unreal, machines become flesh, and vice-versa. At its most bizarre, it can all be a bit much to take in, but at the same time, it proves to be an unmissable experience—a unique vision from a one-of-a-kind director.Max Renn (Woods), president of Channel 83, a satellite station that broadcasts extreme content to a select audience, discovers the existence of Videodrome, a pirate broadcast offering a continuous diet of extreme violence. As Max comes closer and closer to tracking down the source of the programme, he suffers from increasingly bizarre hallucinations. On finally locating Videodrome's originator, TV obsessed radical Brian O'Blivion, Renn discovers that prolonged exposure to Videodrome results in the growth of a mind-altering brain tumour intended to be the next step in man's evolution, and that he is under its control.Chock full of scenes of sadism and sex (which apparently open the synapses, making the viewer more susceptible to Videodrome's powerful signal), and lots of freaky visuals and gore courtesy of top Hollywood make-up maestro Rick Baker, Videodrome is definitely one of Cronenberg's more outrageous and less accessible efforts, but doesn't exist purely to shock: it's actually a very cerebral movie, and opens the debate on whether constant exposure to violence causes one to act in a more violent manner, proposes that close interaction with technology will eventually result in physiological changes to the human body, and surmises that living life in front of a TV can seriously mess with our perception of reality.",Videodrome
13,moonspinner55,"Has the courage of its convictions...however, a wildly overpraised freak-out",3,5 January 2017,"The owner of a small cable channel in Toronto becomes intrigued by the salacious bits of kinky sex coming over from a station in Pittsburgh via an unauthorized satellite dish--actors pretending to be whipped and molested. He soon finds out these people are not willing participants, and that the subversive channel he's intercepting causes strange and dangerous hallucinations. Inscrutable nonsense from writer-director David Cronenberg, whose daze-induced pacing seems drug-addled and self-amused. Still, the filmmaker's loyal fan-base (as well as many professional critics) defend the picture as something profound and meaningful, so personal taste will have to determine its ultimate success. James Woods does give a low-keyed (for him) and interesting central performance. The outrageous special effects by Rick Baker run hot and cold. *1/2 from ****",Videodrome
14,Quinoa1984,remind me never to go to Pittsburgh!,10,19 October 2007,"A possible candidate for the quintessential David Cronenberg movie, this was one of the ones that put him on the map (one of them, I say, as he had a few 80s movies before the big studio hit the Fly), but still speaks like few sci-fi surreal satires can do. It's chilling for some of it, and outright disturbing for most, once or twice you might feel the inclination to laugh at the absurdity of what Cronenberg and his make-up team put together, but it's really a situation where reality becomes crossed with perceptions of reality (and, cough, hallucinations, cough) and the real thing. Warhol called it the Clockwork Orange of the 80s, but one could make other comparisons, maybe more prevalent, like Altered States or Philip K Dick or Jodorowsky or Burroughs (a bit of a connection, in terms of the process of a sort of machine programmed in or through disgusting elements, to Naked Lunch) or even to today's own torture-porn situation in horror movies. They're all there for the taking to group with. But Cronenberg stands alone with this one: it's an extremely personal film for the director, while also never losing sight of what makes the strongest science-fiction crawl under our collective skins.James Woods, in a role that requires him to go from his typical smarmy self to a man in the grip of a perpetual mind-f***, plays Mas Rent, who owns Civic TV- not anything very respectable, just a weirder, dirty cousin of Weird Al's UHF- who comes across a transmission on one of his pirated wavelengths for a program called Videodrome. He thinks that all the torture and mayhem in the program is faked, and that it's brilliant in its low-budget form. He wants it, the real Videodrome tape. But what he doesn't know is that it's all for real, and that the makers of the ""show"" in Pittsburgh are dangerous folk. Soon he gets embroiled into the fold, starts seeing himself hitting women, reaching into his stomach to scratch with a gun, 'plays' videos with his innards, and becomes a killing machine. At first this seems too much, but Cronenberg is a master at making this a multi layered examination: there's the media element, as Cronenberg was a student of Marshall MacLoughan; there's the fetishism, and how that can become manifested through contact with the skin and, of course, the flesh (it starts with just a cigarette burn on a breast); and of course the surrealism, where like somewhere between Kafka and Lynch there is no discernible line after a while between what is not really seen and experienced and what is actually going on. All bets are off.If it's daring by itself in examining the nature of all of these things (and I don't even imagine, I know, that this will be just as exhilarating on a repeat viewing), then the special effects are equally so. The first time you see Woods sitting on the couch, with the hallucinating turning slowly into just a little itch or burn on his stomach into a full gaping would, it never looks fake. Which makes the whole hallucinatory angle so rich and palpable- you feel yourself cringe right along with Max as he plunges his consciousness to the whims of men and women telling him what to do through TV and other forms. Ironically, the movies of the present in the horror world- one wonders if this is more than the usual movie fodder for the likes of the 'torture porn' kings like Eli Roth and the Saw filmmakers- don't have anywhere the finesse and power in how the special effects convey the psychology and mood of the situations. Meanwhile, Cronenberg also makes Videodrome perhaps his best film technically, with his camera becoming part of the surreal and fetisihistic, subtly so, like when Woods and Harry have their sex scene, slow and carnal, and it backs up from them to reveal that they're in the chamber-room of the Videodrome. Or how it comments on the mania that's building in Max's head as he sits and waits for the speaker to come out in the climax. Videodrome remains some twenty-five years later a visceral movie-viewing experience, a film that many will pass off as just your typical Cronenberg fare. It's a lot more: it's like a weird, definitive statement on the things that are most of concern to Cronenberg, at least in the bulk of his originally written work. How does one make the distinction between what's imagined or thought and what is right there whipped on the flesh? It's thought at one point in Videodrome that Max has a brain tumor. Sounds like an explanation, but after a few minutes it changes from being a plot gimmick to a sad fate. Long live the new flesh? What about the dying flesh? It's an extraordinary film, and I can't wait to watch it through fingers covering over my eyes (and peeking through) during the more disgusting parts.",Videodrome
15,BandSAboutMovies,Perfect!,10,4 June 2021,"""The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena: the Videodrome. The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain. Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television.""As a kid, David Cronenberg used to pick up American television from across the border and worried that he'd see something he wasn't supposed to see. Videodrome's CIVIC-TV was based on the Canadian television network Citytv, which had a show called The Baby Blue Movie that played stuff like Camille 2000 and Wild Honey. There's also an urban legend that Cronenberg saw Emanuelle In America and wondered how anyone could enjoy a movie that combined sexuality with snuff footage. I don't know -- or care -- if that story is true. I'd like to just have complete faith in it.The director was between Scanners and The Dead Zone and got a bigger budget on this movie than he never had before. Of course, it barely made its money back yet became a classic film, which is usually the way of the world.Max Renn (James Woods) is the president of CIVIC-TV, a Toronto UHF television station that shows footage on the absolute limit of what is allowed to be shown on TV. One of the satellite dish operators shows Max Videodrome, which is either coming from Malaysia or Pittsburgh -- as a lifelong resident, I am pretty pleased with that -- that shows people being tortured and murdered with no storyline to get in the way.Max's lover, Nikki Brand (Debbie Harry) is so turned on by Videodrome that she goes to try out and never returns. Max is now obsessed and learns that the channel is so much more than just a video show. It may also be the voice of a political movement.Media theorist Brian O'Blivion is the only person who can guide Max further down the tunnel. At the homeless shelter where O'Blivion's daughter Bianca (Sonja Smits, The Pit) conducts marathon TV watching experiments. He soon learns that O'Blivion was killed by his partners who created Videodrome but lives on in the hours of video footage he created. Oh yeah -- Videodrome also creates brain tumors and hallucinations which are both the symptom and the cause.Videodrome is really part of an ideological war between its sex and violence-obsessed viewers and Barry Convex (Leslie Carlson, Black Christmas) and the Spectacular Optical Corporation, a combination ophthalmology and arms company. They program Max - via videotapes inserted into a vaginal opening in his chest that causes his body to transform and even grow a gun in his hand - to murder anyone that gets in their way, which may or may not all be hallucinations, until Bianca reprograms him to start killing for her father's cause, shouting ""Death to Videodrome. Long live the new flesh.""That new flesh means ascending outside of the bonds of our normal form, which for Max means suicide. Or does it? There were plenty of endings made for this movie, including one where Max, Bianca and Nicki appear on the set of Videodrome, all with slits in their chests filled with sex organs. As an atheist, Cronenberg cut this ending, as he felt it may make people think he believed in Heaven. He was also forced to cut all manner of berserk things from the script, like Max having a grenade for a hand, as well as him melting into Nicki as they kissed and a total of five more characters dying of cancer.This sequence sums up why I love this movie so much:Max Renn: Why do it for real? It's easier and safer to fake it.Masha: Because it has something that you don't have, Max. It has a philosophy. And that is what makes it dangerous.You can hear dialogue from this movie in tons of songs, including ""Microphone Test"" by Meat Beat Manifesto, ""Master Hit"" by Front 242, ""Children"" by EMF, ""Draining Faces"" by Skinny Puppy, ""Scared to Live"" by Psychic TV and so many more.For a movie made in 1983, it really could have been made today. There's so much to experience here and I will be going back for another experience. See you in Pittsburgh.",Videodrome
16,Coventry,James Woods; human VCR,6,21 September 2018,"David Cronenberg is undoubtedly a brilliant and truly unique director, but also someone with a seriously twisted and deranged mind. How else would you explain the unworldly bizarre storylines of his 70s & 80s ""body-horror"" classics, and ""Videodrome"" in particular? I might be crazy for watching and loving these type of movies, but Cronenberg wrote them, so he must be totally bonkers beyond repair! Admittedly, however, ""Videodrome"" is my least favorite Cronenberg effort of that period. I can't really explain why, but the story isn't nearly as compelling and unsettling as the case in ""Scanners"", ""Shivers"", ""The Brood"", ""Rabid"", ""The Dead Zone"" or ""The Fly"". It also doesn't help, of course, that meanwhile the plot is hopelessly dated. Cronenberg was experimenting with visual technology during the heights of the videotape era here, but I reckon that younger horror fans nowadays laugh hysterically at the sight of an old-fashioned video cassette being shoved into a vagina-resembling body wound. James Woods stars as Max Renn, a cable TV programmer who's continuously seeking for the ultimate viewing experience. He picks up an illegal transmission of a show called ""Videodrome"", and instantly becomes intrigued by its S/M images and snuff-movie realism. During his search for additional Videodrome footage, and finding out who's responsible for making them, Renn doesn't realize that his hallucinations, caused by watching the show are gradually taking control of his body and brains. I think the main problem (or MY main problem, at least) with ""Videodrome"" is the absurdity of the concept (operating people like VCR's), as well as the film's complex narrative structure. Cronenberg may not be the greatest storyteller, but what he lacks in that department he widely compensates in terms of creating an uncanny and claustrophobic atmosphere. Also, the plot and the scenery may have dated, but Rick Baker's special effects still look stupendous! Although there sadly isn't a sequence as powerful as the notorious head explosion in ""Scanners"", the cruel and violent massacres during the final act of the film are by far my favorite moments of the film. James Woods is excellent as Max Renn and finds the exact right balance between being a sleazy thrill-seeker and a pitiable victim. Deborah Harry, singer of ""Blondie"", is also very impressive as Renn's kinky and pain-addicted girlfriend (with cigarette burns on her breasts to prove it!)",Videodrome
17,Theo Robertson,"Dated Which Means It's Less Shocking But Still Remains A Bleak , Depressing , Nihilistic Mindbending Thriller",8,12 October 2012,"The early 1980s was a different era in some ways and in some ways it was the same as today . Comparing it to 2012 is like looking at a parallel universe . The Daily Mail and other right wing tabloids would be concerned about the moral health of Great Britain and nothing disgusted the rags more than the advent of the video recorder . Every murder and violent crime committed in the last quarter of the 20th Century was souly caused by people watching video nasties . Interesting to remember that two of the most popular shows on British television in the 1980s were JIM'LL FIX IT and THAT'S LIFE when both Jimmy Savile and Esther Rantzen were great role models to the great British publicVIDEODROME captures the spirit of these times . For many years people would debate if there was even such a thing as a "" snuff movie "" but with the advent of the internet the urban myth of the snuff movie has been dispelled . Jihadist scum proudly post videos of violent murders of both infidels and heretics alike and if we're talking moral corruption both worthless nobodies and big name celebrities happily download images and videos of children being , raped , abused and mutilated for their own sexual enjoyment In other words this makes VIDEODROME a rather dated film but one that remains prophetic . It is in effect a film that predates the likes of THE LAWNMOWER MAN , TOTAL RECALL , INCEPTION and all these other mind bending thrillers featuring virtual reality but with a much smaller budget than the films that followed it Cronenberg makes up for the lack of budget by concentrating on performances and a brooding atmosphere . The criminally underrated James Woods is an actor you'll either love or hate and gives his usual intense over caffinated edgy performance and if he read out his shopping list I'd still find it a compelling experience . He has a great sexual chemistry with Debbie Harry but how difficult is it not to have sexual chemistry with the lead singer of Blondie ? It says a lot about a film when you have no idea what is going on and can't explain the plot but you're still hypnotised by it . Even more so this is the anti-thesis of the feel good movie . Sado-masochism features as does self mutilation , psychosis and murder and the film ends bleakly with the suicide of the anti-hero . It's this shocking , depressing nihilism that makes VIDEODROME so memorable. The Cronenberg remake of THE FLY might be his most enjoyable film but perhaps VIDEODROME is his best movie",Videodrome
18,Hey_Sweden,"It has a philosophy, and that is what makes it dangerous.",8,7 January 2018,"This stunning film, grim and graphic at nearly every turn, is an incredible early work by David Cronenberg when he was still into his ""body horror"" cycle. (""The Dead Zone"", done the same year, broke him free for a moment.) James Woods delivers an amiable performance as Max Renn, operator / part owner of a small time cable TV station. He's looking for edgy new programming, and his employee Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) shows him the pirated transmissions of a hideous series dubbed ""Videodrome"". There are no stories to speak of, it's just straight-ahead torture and degradation. Well, as it turns out, viewing Videodrome causes freaky and strikingly violent hallucinations for just about anybody.Taking a journey into the worlds of David Cronenberg is always interesting, if nothing else. And ""interesting"" is never a bad quality to possess. Some people may wince at the effects sequences in these early movies, but they are evidence of the way that Cronenberg could often appeal to adult intellects as well as affect them at gut level.Here, he hypothesizes that television and technology are so ingrained into human experience and existence that they can become part of our physical makeup, so to speak. His themes are prophetic; ""Videodrome"" could be seen as a way-ahead-of-the-game forerunner to the ""torture porn"" sub genre that exploded in the 21st century. And the desire for some networks and stations to try to draw people in with entertainment that they can't get anywhere else has remained relevant over the decades.Approximately 35 years later, the wonderfully gross Rick Baker effects lose none of their power to amaze. This viewer was particuarly delighted by the pulsating videotape and television set, and by that ""flesh gun"" that results when a regular gun is fused into Max's body.Cinematographer Mark Irwin and composer Howard Shore do typically excellent work. This is also a nice showcase for a solid cast: Woods, Sonja Smits, Deborah Harry (the Blondie singer looks VIVACIOUS, and is intriguing as an enigmatic woman who gets off on physical pain), Lynne Gorman, Jack Creley, Dvorsky, and Les Carlson as Barry Convex, the villain of the piece.After all this time, the new flesh is still living a very long life.Eight out of 10.",Videodrome

20,poolandrews,"""Why would anyone watch a scum show like Videodrome?"" Possibly Cronenberg's best.",9,2 February 2007,"Videodrome is set in Toronto, Canada where Max Renn (James Woods) runs a cable TV station called Civic TV which specialises in murder, gore, death & sex. In his pursuit to find ever harder & nastier material Max has his technician Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) illegally probe the airwaves for programmes, Harlan says he picked up a broadcast of a pirate TV show called 'Vidodrome' which is just shockingly realistic footage of murder, torture & mutilation. Max becomes fascinated with Videodrome & is determined to get the show on his channel, he ask's around about the origins of the show & is soon contacted by a man name Barry Convex (Les Carlson) who tells Max that Videodrome broadcasts a signal which makes a tumour grow inside the viewers head & depending on the content of the show produces hallucinations. Convex goes on to say that his organisation intends to broadcast Videodrome & kill off all the lowlifes in society who would want to watch such filth starting with the viewers of Civic TV...This Canadian American co-production was written & directed by David Cronenberg & for my money is maybe the best film he's ever made along with the remake of The Fly (1986) although that's a debatable issue, anyway what isn't debatable a far as I'm concerned is that Videodrome is a brilliant film & easily the best of his early works. The script is very intelligent & obviously tackles the relevant close-to-home issue of what we watch on TV & how it's used to manipulate us, it just makes the unnerving analogy that TV influences us in almost every-way including our health in a extremely effective way. Videodrome also makes the interesting point that violence on our screens may have an effect on our own behaviour & make society more violent in itself but at the same time also promotes the idea that on screen violence satisfies our own violent desires summed up by the great line ""better on TV than the streets"". Then there's the shadowy organisation headed up by Barry Convex just to add a nice sinister little conspiracy theory to the narrative. The dialogue is sharp, clever & knowing as is the whole film, there's much here to take in & digest, in fact I've seen Videodrome four times now the most recent being last night & I still saw & 'got' things I hadn't previously. I love how the film pans out, how the character's end up, how things aren't quite what they seem & that if you were to show it to ten different people there could possibly be ten different interpretations of it. A real quality film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. The only negative thing I can say is that it's definitely not a film for everyone & I felt a bit cheated by the annoyingly abrupt ending although I don't really know what else Cronenberg could have done.Director Cronenberg dos a great job here, there's a really sleazy atmosphere about it, thee's the expected twisted surreal imagery that works perfectly especially the cool scenes where Max has a grotesque living videotape inserted into a slit in his stomach. Being a Cronenberg film Videodrome doesn't shy away from some decent gore, there's some gory gunshot wounds, an ear piercing, plenty of torture, someone has half their arm taken off & a scene where someone explodes from the inside & their guts & brains erupt from their body.With a supposed budget of about $5,592,000 (which actually sounds like quite a lot of money) Videodrome didn't set the box-office on fire which is a shame as it's a class film, it's very well made with some terrific special effects & clever ideas, I also thought the music was excellent & very moody. According to the IMDb the trailer fro Videodrome was made almost entirely on a Commodore 64, obviously when I read this I had to take a look at it & besides being one of the most bizarre trailers ever it's obvious that the studio didn't know how to advertise it & maybe that's one reason why it didn't do better at theatres. The acting is great by all involved especially James Woods who is completely brilliant, Debbie Harry doesn't actually get that much screen time.Videodrome is a brilliant horror sci-fi thriller that has plenty to say although sometimes not always coherently but that was half the fun for me, to try & unravel what Cronenbrg is trying to say & the message he is trying to get across plus it adds to it's re-watch appeal. An intelligent well thought-out & complex film that with lots of ideas & themes that Cronenberg would latter re-use in eXistenz (1999) which shares quite a few similarities with Videodrome but isn't as good. For those who are looking for something different & twisted Videodrome is the film for you.",Videodrome

22,Boba_Fett1138,"One of the weirdest, one of the most inaccessible, one of the greatest!",8,3 January 2007,"This is a very interesting and intriguing early movie from acclaimed director David Cronenberg.The movie is definitely not a formulaic standard piece of work. It features lots of odd hallucinating moments, mixed with sadomasochist sex. The movie does reach the point at times, when you're not sure any more if the main character is hallucinating, or if things are real. It give the movie a nightmarish like atmosphere, which is the reason why this movie can be regarded as an horror movie. But it's not a typical horror movie with scare moments, or monsters, or anything like that. It above all is a very imaginative movie that is not alway accessible or easy to understand but always interesting and intriguing to watch.In the beginning its not clear were the movie is heading to. The movie begins as a 'normal' one, then the movie starts to show sadomasochist and erotic tendencies, before it turns into an hallucinating-trip, filled with gore and violence.The movie can be seen as a one that warns about the 'dangers of television' when truth and fiction can not be told apart anymore and fiction actually starts becoming reality. It also uses some virtual reality themes to make this point, which was quite unique for 1983, for no one had really heard about this concept at that time period. It makes the movie futuristic but at the same time also outdated in some of its themes, though the main concept of the movie is still relevant today, perhaps even more than in 1983 was the case.It's definitely not the most accessible movie to watch. It's highly imaginative and also quite odd at times. Yet the movie remains strangely perfectly watchable, even though you never really fully get to understand the things that are going on the movie. The movie chooses to leave many things unexplained and also ends with a suiting open-ending. Andy Warhol was right to call this movie the ""A Clockwork Orange"" of the '80's.The movie does a brilliant job at mixing various different movie styles and combine it into a unique of its own, type of style and atmosphere. Fantasy, horror, mystery, sci-fi, thriller, sex this movie has all those elements in it. The movie is very lively directed by David Cronenberg. His directing is probably the main reason why the movie in the end works out so extremely well. Before this he made mostly B-type of horror movies but with this movie he shows his true skills of greatness. After this 2 other great movies by him were made; ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Fly"". Quite unique for a director now days to make three great movies in a row. Cronenberg seems to understand the genres he ventures into but always choose to alter it and provide the movie with an unique style of its own that can not be easily labeled. ""Videodrome"" is perhaps the very best and most obvious example of this. The only movie that got close to the style and atmosphere of this movie was Cronenberg's own movie ""eXistenZ"", that definitely shows some similarities with this movie, also with its themes. ""Videodrome"" is still Cronenberg's most unique and imaginative work.Of course the movie is also definitely helped by it's visual and hallucinative atmosphere that is filled with lots of gore and violence. It's well made and good looking. It doesn't try to impress, though some of the techniques used in this movie were definitely unique and not done before. I was especially surprised by the gore in the movie. At first it didn't seem that this was going to be a gory one. It seemed more like it was going to be a psychological thriller, with supernatural elements about a 'killer' TV station. Sort of like ""The Ring"". Yet the movie in the end showed more and more gore in a realistic sort of way only Cronenberg can make it. The cast also does a good job at always keeping things realistic, no matter how unusual it all seems and gets. The movie is well written with some good dialog that is greatly delivered by its cast. James Woods does a good job at playing the main character, in a role we'll not easily see him in anymore now days.An unique, great and engaging viewing experience.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Videodrome
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I just can't cope with the freaky stuff,7,29 November 2010,"Based upon the Unrated Version. Max Renn chooses what programs to put on his small channel, and to compete with the larger ones, he goes for what they can't show sex and violence(two subjects Cronenberg deals with whenever he can in his work, and that he feel are intrinsically connected to one another). Not unlike exploitation films when the movie theatre had to try to win back some of the audience it lost to the ""tube"". When we meet him, he's already quite desensitized(from all the emotional content and stimuli he gets daily, and without any effort other than to keep his eyes open), passing actual conflict without considering helping out. Once he becomes exposed to Videodrome(seemingly a snuff production), it only gets worse. He begins to hallucinate, and we do so along with him. It is impossible to say with absolute certainty what is fiction and what is not in this picture. We lose track. Is this an indictment of television(note that several of the people in this are introduced by their image on the small screen... and try to count the amount of TVs in this), one that says that ""too much of it leaves you braindead""? No, that would be a superficial reading of this. It's about the nature of perception, which is what shapes our reality, in fact, it's the only thing that does. Complex and compelling, this is not for everyone. The FX are amazing; true, some of them don't completely hold up to this day, but I was so engrossed in it that it never took me out of it. This has impeccable acting, with Woods giving a performance that is very unlike what we usually see from him and shining from the first frame. The length sans credits is 82 minutes, and that's because the plot moves so fast, yet without you losing track of what's going on. I initially watched this in my early teen years, and though I did not understand the symbolism within it, I followed all of the story's developments. This is terrifying and bizarre, and will stay in your mind for quite a while(it's been ten years since my original viewing, and yet I remembered almost everything, shy a few details). The editing is sharp and tight. It isn't perfect; some of the characters, especially Harlan aka ""stop saying Patron"", are quirky and irritating. The attempts at humor all fall flat, at least in my opinion. It's not that this needs to get you laughing, it's not about that... however, when it does try and it fails so completely at it, I feel it deserves mentioning. There is a bit of brutal S&M(including torture) and occasional strong language in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys pondering the meaning of their cinema. 7/10",Videodrome

Most of the time it is a negatively viewed item which is the utmost of irony. Here it is, T.V. and movies are being used as a medium to warn against T.V. and movies.In Videodrome they address something that is discussed even today: desensitization to sex and violence due to television. Now you can add videogames and music to that list, but I think T.V. is just the umbrella for all forms of media.The whole matter is a tad scary and we know it is true to some degree. The thought that we could be being programmed by television. And we are. Some of us are programmed more than others: what to wear, what to eat, what's beauty, what's ugly, and on and on. But television is so ubiquitous now that there is no avoiding it. It's at the barbershop, the gym, the laundromat, I was watching T.V. today at the Peruvian restaurant I went to.Videodrome is the extreme of what T.V. programming can do.

25,evanston_dad,"Typical Cronenberg, Clinical and Full of Ick",6,2 November 2014,"""Icky"" pretty much sums up this David Cronenberg freak fest about a small-time TV executive who will stop at nothing to get ratings for his obscure and grassroots network.James Woods is the exec, and he gives a very good, very grounded performance in a movie that more often feels like a fever dream than a coherent narrative. In typical Cronenberg fashion, the film blends queasy horror with deadpan black humor to mostly good effect, which means the film always stays just this side of taking itself too seriously, a key ingredient in a story that's going to be this out there. But on the other hand, also in typical Cronenberg fashion, the film feels clinical and abstract, more about ideas than about characters or plot, which makes it difficult to become fully engaged in it.I will say that the film is fairly prophetic in its thesis that consumers of mass media will crave stronger and stronger depravity as they become desensitized to the material available to them. It made me think of the horror movie trend, and how just the idea of a masked stalker picking off teens was a scary enough idea even if we never saw the gory results in full detail, whereas now the youth market doesn't seem to think a movie is scary enough unless we see people killed with all the grisly detail of an autopsy.Grade: B-",Videodrome

33,siderite,Disturbing precursor to eXistenZ,8,26 October 2014,"There are three things to expect from watching this movie. First of all will be the overwhelming desire to fast forward. The 1983 pace, long shots and atmospheric mood combine with psychological sleaziness that just makes you want to take a shower. The second one is that you will be disturbed. This is not about you being the toughest horror movie watcher in the world and nothing can get you, it's about the weird combination of sleazy characters, themes of biological change and infestation and hallucinatory experiences which you cannot separate from ""real"". The third and final thing is that you will not ""get it"". Even if you understood most of the film and what it tends to symbolize, you will still get the feeling that you missed something.The rest is difficult if not impossible to explain. James Woods is just the perfect choice for the lead role, while Deborah Harry (Blondie) is incredibly cute. Both of them start setting up the mood of the film. He is a partner in a minor TV station that wants to break out by using shocking or controversial stuff, while she is an emotional relief radio show celebrity that likes to be roughed up during sex and gets turned on at scenes of torture. But only then it gets weird, with the introduction of a pirate show that can mess up your perception of reality.I cannot say more than that without spoiling it all. What I gathered from the film is that it is a manifesto against the mass manipulation of reality by the media. It goes way metaphorical on this, and in an age where this was not as much of a problem as now. It tries to shock you into thinking for yourself. Many of the themes that are seen in the film are also found in eXistenZ, only Videodrome is really at another level of weirdness. It is more a combination of eXistenZ and The Dead Zone, if you can imagine something like that, both Cronenberg movies.Bottom line: As with eXistenZ I didn't like the fact that the main character was not in control of the perception of reality, making the entire experience hallucinatory and hard to make sense of. However the weirdness and the good casting and acting really make this film original and well above average. Even if it clearly didn't reach its purpose - very few people have even heard of the film - it is certainly a film worth watching. However make sure you are prepared for the three points I made at the beginning of this review and, if you started watching it, do keep going.",Videodrome

Written & Directed David Cronenberg, this body horror flick, is certainly not meant for the faint-hearted.'Videodrome' is set in Toronto during the early 80s, and follows the CEO of a small cable station, played by James Woods, who stumbles upon a broadcast signal featuring extreme violence and torture. The signal causes brain tumors in viewers, and is later revealed to have been developed by the government as part of a conspiracy.To even imagine something so weird, creepy & out-of-the-box, deserves a mention. David Cronenberg's writing & direction gives you the feel of weirdness. Some sequences are nicely written and are nicely executed too. BUT, some portions put you off completely. The overdose of gore and bloodshed, especially, plays a spoil-sport. Cinematography by Mark Irwin is alright.Acting-Wise: James Woods delivers a natural performance. Deborah Harry's performance throws chills down your spine. Sonja Smits is impressive. Leslie Carlson is good. Others lend support.On the whole, A strictly NO-NO for the faint-hearted. But, for those, who can digest gore & absurdity, without limits, should NOT give this cult-classic a miss.",Videodrome
35,lasttimeisaw,a reflective and trenchantly ironic fable,7,11 January 2017,"Cronenberg's body horror presciently burrows into the hallucinatory immersion of virtual reality more than 30 years ago, VIDEODROME, its title refers to a series of video images with contents of mondo exploitation, torture and murder, which entice our protagonist Max Renn (Woods) into an almost involuntary addiction to its subversiveness and perverse sexual gratifications. Renn is the president of a Toronto-based television station, which specializes in producing subterranean programs consist of violence and soft-core pornography to a niche market. So, the discovery of Videodrome thrills him to the core, after shares it with his new acquaintance, a luscious radio host Nicki Brand (Harry, in her iconic filmic bravura), whose masochistic proclivity surprises him, Max begins to trace down the original source of Videodrome, which leads him to Bianca (Smits), the daughter of Professor Brian O'Blivion (Creley), one of the in-crowds, but only gets further befuddled by the video cassettes he is offered to watch, which elicit the eeriest hallucination starting from a suddenly animated cassette and a throbbing TV set, into which he can submerge his face, then he rips his own abdomen open and puts a pistol inside. This is a high water-mark for special effects and makeup work, under the supervision of the now legendary Rick Baker, before things turn into more conventional bloodbath and repugnant viscous mutations (quite Cronenberg's trademark) during Max's killing spree when he is brainwashed into slaughtering his colleagues, until he is rescued by Bianca, and enlightened into a ""leave the old flesh""rebellion towards those who are behind this largely unspecified conspiracy theory, and finally accepts his predestined fate, to embrace his new flash in a nihilistic finale. By my lights, Videodrome is designed to eliminate those who are easily subjected to what it offers by fostering a certain brain tumor into the addicted viewers, so as to cull the deprived-minded from the mass and make North America strong again, which is an ingenious idea, but under the film's succinct length and Cronenberg's preference of stimulating our ocular sense, it doesn't hit the mark. The cast is utilitarian, James Woods can be very arresting on top of his every-man appearance, emblazoned by his maniac detachment; Debbie Harry, the leading singer of Blondie, is purely designed as a beacon of lust and self-destruction, heightened by the gratuitous nudity, and Peter Dvorsky, as Max's tech-savvy sidekick Harlan, serves as a key conspirator as a well-conceived game-changer. As an analog-era surreal horror, VIDEODROME bears the trappings of the epoch with the now obsolete video cassettes, cathode ray tubes and shoulder-padding garments, but what still remains as a hot-button topic is its savvy forewarning of the televised stimuli on individuals, now predominantly in the form of ubiquitous computer, laptop, pad, cell-phone screens, a trend seems to be unstoppable, it deeply shifts our way of assimilating information and communicating with others, not to mention, in the movie, there is also a prototype of VR helmet, as unwieldy and intimidating as it should be, we are expected to feel scary about it, but now, in 2017, many of us would take that gizmo immediately to luxuriate in a state of euphoria and get a kick into an unmapped un-reality so damning enthralling but also potentially perilous, yet, this is the future, and it is coming, which makes Cronenberg's vintage horror a more reflective and trenchantly ironic fable,",Videodrome
36,Red-Barracuda,Come to Nicki...,10,28 October 2012,"Videodrome is arguably David Cronenberg's best film. It's certainly one of his strangest. Unlike the movies he directed before it, this one was not a commercial success. Seemingly it was not marketed very well but I also suppose that it was just too dark and strange for many. In it James Woods plays Max Renn an executive from a satellite TV channel specialising in sex and violence. He happens upon a mysterious snuff transmission called 'Videodrome' and becomes addicted to it. The constant exposure to this alters his biology leading him to experience various hallucinations. But the changes do not stop there and the technology alters not only his reality but our evolution as a species.In this film Cronenberg combined his unique sub-genre of body horror with new technology. Seeing as this was the early 80's this was videotapes and satellite TV. This new media brought with it a perceived threat to society. Various bodies thought that the plethora of films focusing on sex and violence released into homes via videotape would bring about moral decline and make society more violent. Videodrome is partly a comment on this. Seeing as Cronenberg himself was a purveyor of violent and sexually transgressive films he was one of the targets of these groups. In Videodrome he makes exactly the kind of film his detractors would dislike about the ideas they themselves were promoting; i.e. exposure to images of violence can destroy us. It seems to me quite clear that Cronenberg does not really believe such things but has interestingly used them as a framework for a sci-fi horror film.Of course one of the most memorable things about this movie is its excellent Rick Baker special effects. Not only are they very good but they are also highly imaginative. The sexual television set, the pulsating videotapes, the vaginal stomach VCR, biomechanical guns, a man whose body rips apart and the strange reality of the video world. It's consistently fascinating and always extremely well done. James Woods is perfect in the role of the scuzzy central character but there is also a memorable turn by Debbie Harry as a sadomasochistic character called Nicki.Videodrome may well not have been fully appreciated at the time of its release but in the final analysis it is one of the very best achievements of its director.",Videodrome

38,sol1218,Come to me Max.. Come to Nicki,8,22 April 2004,"****SPOILERS**** Far out 1983 film about a number of industrialists and politicians led by the CEO of the Pentagon contracted company Spectacular Optical Barry Convex, Leslie Carlson, trying to manipulate the publics minds with a device called Videodrome. Videodrome works by showing very graphic images of sex and violence, which in this case are real not staged or faked, that trigger and then open up the subconscious mind and nervous system to a TV signal that at first distorts the sense of reality of those watching and then leaves them open to be controlled and used by those broadcasting the signal. In the end the signal cause a brain tumor that kills whoever has been exposed to it.Max Renn, James Woods, runs a Toronto TV station Civic TV channel 83 and is looking for new shows to improve his TV ratings. Going to his friends Harlan, Peter Dvorsky, TV satellite studios Max comes across a clip of a TV show that Harlan taped of extreme sex and violence. Taken back at first Max becomes very interested in what he saw and is told by Harlan that it's an underground show originating from Pittsburgh called Videodrome. Later spending the night with his girlfriend Nicki, Bebbi Harry, Max at Nicki's insistence watch a video tape of Videodrome. Nicki begins to get very weird burning herself with a cigarette and having a surprised and shocked Max pierce both her ears. Later Nicki tells Max that she's leaving Toronto for a new job, she's going to Pittsburgh to work for a TV show called Videodrome. Max by now is starting to get hallucinations and feels that he's losing his mind. Trying to find out about whats causing his hallucinations Max goes to Cathode Ray Mission run by Prof. Brian O'Blivion, who is one of the inventors of Videodrome, and his daughter Bianca, Jack Creley & Sonja Smits that he finds out from Bianca that her father died and after seeing a tape of Prof. O'Blivion that Bianca gave him. It's then that Max now realizes that he's doomed by being exposed to the Videodrome shows that he's been watching, Max also finds out later that Nicki was murdered on that show. Hysterical with fear Max goes to his friend Harlan to find out if he's also suffering for the Videodrome signal only to find out that Harlan is in with Barry Convex in this whole conspiracy and that what has happened to him in his exposer to Videodrome was no accident.Fine Sci-Fi thriller with solid performances by James Woods & Debbi Harry with a very good supporting cast of characters. Max goes through hell and high water as he's programed by Barry Convex and Harlan to do their dirty work but is later De-programed by Biance to turn the tables on them. In the end Max destroys Convex/Harlan & Co. as well as himself who's already dying from the deadly brain tumor that the Videodrome signal afflicted him with.Top special effects with pulsating video tapes and VCR's and flat TV images morphing into three dimensional realities has you, as well as Max, feeling that your suffering from Videodrome induced hallucinations. ""Videodrome"" holds together very well and even the tragic end of both it's top characters Max and Nicki leaves you with a feeling of hope for the future not despair like most Sci-Fi movies like ""Videodrome"" usually do.",Videodrome
39,lost-in-limbo,One very impressive hallucination!,9,15 May 2005,"A cable programmer looking for some ultimately nasty and shocking stuff to put on his cable channel accidentally stumbles across a TV show called Videodrome. He wants to find more about it as the violence on there seems so real and it's what his looking for. Though, this show controls and seduces its viewers into an unusual world of hallucination that can alter life.This is a VERY weird, sometimes chilling and thought-provoking Sci-fi /horror film by David Cronenberg. That twists its visuals and plot between surrealism and reality, sex and violence. While, questioning our relationship with television in a very slickly done nightmare. In doing so it keeps the characters, but also the audience in a daze of bemusement and shock. The concept of the film and special effects might come across as disjointed, pretentious and in bad taste to some, but the sleazy material is suppose to make us question why are we actually watching this snuff? The extraordinary special effects by Oscar winner Rick Baker are tremendously eye-catching and indeed truly pack a wallop a real big one! The performances from James Wood as the wittily cynical cable programmer Max Renn and the incredibly luscious Deborah Harry as the sexy hostess Nicki Brand that has a fetish for pain are simply excellent. The music score, the cinematography and lighting is another bonus to the haunting mix.This is an absolutely compelling and inventive story and with such a dense script, which I must say it still has me unsure what had happened. Though, that gives the film some sort of mystique in alienating the viewer, by leaving it up to us to decide what had happen. There's definitely more to this film than its special effects, but an actual commentary on the use of the medium and the unsound fascination of it. With the Videodrome show being the metaphor for it.It's definitely not an easy film to explain, so just wait until you see it for yourself and make up your own interruption of the film. That's if you can stomach it.This cult film is highly recommended.",Videodrome

Woods is his usual smarmy self, and Deborah Harry adds the kink factor but not much more. Eventually ""Videodrome"" turns into a dog and pony show for Cronenberg's special effects. If you are looking for viewing thrills, I suggest you look elsewhere, because the gross and grotesque on display here have little meaning other than to be gross and grotesque. When I watched this 25 years ago I was not impressed, and seeing it now has regrettably not altered my opinion. Not acceptable as entertainment. Not recommended. - MERK",Videodrome

42,poe426,The hardcore version of The Twonky...,10,9 May 2009,"Too much television can be hazardous to your health; your mental health, in particular. In the introduction to his collection, STRANGE WINE, author Harlan Ellison cites a number of compelling reasons why. VIDEODROME offers several of its own. Writer/director David Cronenberg, before ""going legit"" (i.e.; selling out) was a filmmaker to be reckoned with: pioneering his own brand of ""biological horror,"" he managed to elevate the fright film to new heights. VIDEODROME would prove to be one of his last truly original and compelling visions. (Both EXISTENZ and CRASH would offer brief reminders of the old glory, but all too brief reminders only: to revel in the kind of mind-blowing movie-making for which Cronenberg had become famous, one would need to go all the way back to VIDEODROME.) Whereas THE TWONKY took a humorous look at the long-term effects of too much televiewing, VIDEODROME took, if you will, a ""tumorous look."" By being willing to sit and watch pretty much anything (including snuff films), Cronenberg seems to suggest, we are aiding in our own destruction- committing, in effect, suicide. (We know, now, that the flickering video images coming at us from our telesets, though moving too quickly for the eye to detect, can nonetheless cause permanent damage to the eye.) We sit and watch and turn off our minds. We are thoroughly brainwashed. (And, if cellular phones are alleged to cause tumors, why not The Tube?) VIDEODROME, at the time of its release, was a wake-up call. A call to arms against the coaxial creature. Unfortunately, most people stayed at home (no doubt watching television) and the warning went unheeded. (And FANTASTIC FILMS, which was running most of my criticism in those days, for some reason passed on the extensive review I gave VIDEODROME. That review was one of the few I wrote at that time that I really wanted to see in print.) Cronenberg doesn't take his jabs at The Idjit Box without a dose of his own dark humor: when a wannabe telexecutive is gunned down onstage by James Woods (who gives an absolutely brilliant performance, by the way; better even than his turn as the scumbag in THE ONION FIELD), the man is so corrupt (as clear-cut a comment on the type of people who run telenetworks as I've ever seen), that he pops open like some Lovecraftian horror and his innards literally ooze out onto the stage like festering tumors. There are still lessons to be learned, here. Long live the New Flesh.",Videodrome
43,marmar-69780,videodrome,8,31 May 2020,"Videodrome is very weird film and cronenberg was able to put a good idea on a screen and make a very good little film,i think that most effective parts of a film were staff that cronenberg does best and that is body horror and in this movie that staff worked very well and it offered us some nasty but also very effective scenes,there are also some scenes that are little weird and that makes you to ask yourself does our lead character from beginning of film is having hallucinations or not,james woods was very good and even if he wasnt likeable he was still only interesting character to me,videodrome was a very effective film that suceeded its mission",Videodrome
44,jzappa,Another Correspondent of the Unconscious by David Cronenberg,9,1 February 2009,"David Cronenberg's understanding that conceptual emotions are disconcertingly influential when visually and atmospherically represented in illustrative, sensory ways has brought him gradual steps closer to producing high-brow art-house cinema, and one of those steps on the way was Videodrome.In a genre in which death ultimately defines its content and attraction, Cronenberg transcends it by ignoring death as a trigger of fear. In a Cronenberg film, conditions and processes of disease is never an extrinsic cause. It doesn't come from aliens, zombies, vampires or natural predators. In a Cronenberg film, genuine affliction and contamination are usually identical to genuine aural comfort, and their mutual root is physiology, as we see here in James Woods's transfigured abdomen. The Canadian ""veneral horror"" director is radical enough to give off that disorder isn't automatically bad. Cronenberg's images are bizarrely alluring, a correspondent of the unconscious, yet in Videodrome they're sometimes hilarious. As usual, this Howard Shore-scored Cronenberg outing is a deranged organic zone where mind and body, relentlessly traversing the mechanistic interpretation for assimilation, are so susceptible as to be easily adjoined by the technology produced by them. Cronenberg characterizes physicality as one immersed within savage association with the soul. In Videodrome, Cronenberg familiarizes control networks that are virtually imperceptible. Cronenberg signifies that the body is an impermanent form between one's actuality and the generation of a ""new flesh"" in which the television screen is, not figuratively, the retina of the mind's eye. In the hypnotic dimension of this cult film, the sole means to counteract extinction is to convert into complete electronic force. While I don't believe to entire comprehend Videodrome intellectually, Cronenberg radiates arresting imagery of how television revolutionizes the body. What's Videodrome about? S&M as a modified mode of being and the power of the image over society that more personally conducts our life than any politician. Very much like Network, what was in its time a sardonic composition of what in social morals deserves criticism turns out to be spookily precise in its prophecy of the TV panorama now, with its reality shows that subliminally infer that life on TV is more certain than life in one's own skin. Essentially, this surrealist biopunk film is about those who would command entrée to all broadcasting. It applauds technology as it vilifies its power, amassing a predictive visualization of squalor and oppression. Cronenberg reflects what tends to be intuitively suppressed and makes apparent those structures of control unseen by the tangible barren eye. Videodrome exudes another facet to Cronenberg's need to understand how the existence carried by the media influences us metaphorically. Videocassettes ascribe human form. TV reaches out to touch you: One's body becomes its machine rather than the other way around. Cronenberg films incline all-consuming introspection, esoteric and abstract, where sensation-fueled dreams, underlying theoretical principles, evolution, mental processes, and technology converge. Videodrome may belong to his schlockier era, it is no exception but in fact a quintessential example.",Videodrome
45,videorama-759-859391,Death by t.v.,6,4 December 2014,"Videodrome is rather a more low key film of Cronenberg's, not up to the standard of where Scanners and Shivers sit, where as you can gather, this movie has gathered a sort of cult following. I found bits of the movie quite bland, where I was trying to give it a chance. One relief about it, is that it has a great actor in the lead, where Woods as a sleazy producer, seems too good for the movie, where one might asks themselves, ""Why did he do this?"". Deborah Harry as his lover, and previously industry rival, impressed me too. Woods character is corrupt and diseased in how he only cares about his ratings, and f..k who gets hurt. So too, it has a clear message of ""What goes around, comes around"". There are some particular nasty moments. where Woods has bought a new channel, Videodrome, which is much more than that. When you insert this particular tape, depicting ongoing rape, snuff- ""you can't take your eyes off it"" stuff, which manipulates Wood's character, thinking the actors are so good. It isn't acting, it's real. This tape possesses you, in which it takes over your mind. I must admit what I liked about this kind of bland, low key film, we're the special effects like that fist slowly coming out of the television (film's bast part), or when Wood's is forced to stick the videotape into his stomach. The last fifteen minutes really got more serious, where the final frame, and it's dialogue, sold it, memorably. For Cronenberg fans, Videodrome is worth a watch. Again with it's complex story, it just doesn't stack up to Cronenberg's others. You'll probably only insert and eject this baby once, though I did watch it twice, first time around.",Videodrome

He takes a cerebral look at the ever popular fad of pirate satellite feeds and small-time t.v. channels. It was during this time that video tapes and satellite t.v. were becoming popular. Cronenberg decided to uses these and make a very strange and clinically sexually film. As with all of his films the sex seems mechanical, neither stimulating or sensual.James Woods stars as the part owner of a small t.v. station who pirates satellite feeds and scours the world for erotic film and programming that he could use for his station.

48,Polaris_DiB,Suturing,10,30 March 2007,"This is by far the best Cronenberg work I have ever seen. Videodrome is another movie of Cronenberg's about the issue of media (like his later eXistenZ), but this time it is smoother and completely sutures technophobia and technophilia into an exquisite horror film piece... with, of course, his particular brand of quirky humor.Many other movies, including other movies by Cronenberg, deal with this issue, but none of them so fully encompass the pain and the pleasure both mixed into the issue of techno-realism, especially in such a concisely self-reflexive way. He is no stranger to Freudian and philosophical concepts (in a Cronenberg film, often an image isn't phallic...it's a phallus), but this time they are more engendered into the dialog than, for instance, eXistenZ, which couldn't help at some points to make points about a different medium as if the other medium was ""worse"".Cronenberg's cyborg-mentality comes to its consummate heights. Televisions become flesh and flesh becomes technology (""Long live the new flesh!""), and the use of both concepts has the double-edged sword of technological achievement: it can be used for good, or used for bad. James Woods' character is not only suffering through the work, he is ravished... he's not only pleased by Videodrome, he's ecstatic. The discussions in the movie about the nature of violence, the nature of sex, the desensitization, is perfect for a movie filled with all three things: with Cronenberg's subtle use of imagery and dialog mixed with his overt use of abject art (you know, people exploding into piles of cancer-tissue, guns winding themselves through flesh, a vaginal hole in a man's stomach), the movie remains shocking--and delightful!--over twenty years after it came out.The ending is perfect, too. It obviously assumes a pleasure-filled epilogue (one that was originally written into the script) but doesn't show it, leaving the doubt to what degree any of the proceedings were more hallucinations or, even worse, how much the film itself has begun to affect the audience.--PolarisDiB",Videodrome
49,ackstasis,"""The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye""",7,20 May 2011,"David Cronenberg is a bit of an oddity. I also watched a Guy Maddin film recently, so perhaps it's something the Canadians are putting in their water. But, as a film buff, please keep on drinking! 'Videodrome (1983)' purports to explore the future of television – in which, owing to the brain's inability to discern TV images from reality, the television itself essentially becomes an extension of the human body. Cathode tube radiation forms a new organ in the brain, fuelling the creation of new realities; hardware and human tissue grotesquely combine to form a ""new flesh."" James Woods grows a vagina in his abdomen, into which videotapes can be inserted. No, you didn't misread that. Cronenberg is probably the king of the ""body horror"" sub-genre, in which the abjectness of the human body is brought to the fore, often using very impressive and realistic visual effects (another example in Cronenberg's repertoire is 'The Fly (1986),' with everybody's favourite guy, Jeff Goldblum). 'Videodrome' blurs the line between illusion and reality, between human and machine, between bad taste and high art. There's something compelling about this, but I wouldn't recommend it as a date movie.",Videodrome
50,dee.reid,"""Videodrome"" - Cronenberg takes on the media",8,22 September 2005,"It takes the slightest peeks at his career to figure out David Cronenberg (""The Fly,"" ""Dead Ringers,"" ""Naked Lunch,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" the upcoming ""A History of Violence"") is a director who is not to be toyed with. I forgot to add in his 1983 horror movie ""Videodrome,"" and there is a reason for that, which I'll talk about later. His works provoke intelligent thought, and terrify those who can't comprehend it. His films stimulate, offend, and move those who care to watch them with an open mind.Allow me to (try) explain. I won't bother to go into detail about the plot. A sleazy, lowlife TV producer named Max Renn (James Woods) rapidly becomes obsessed with an unusual television signal, which in turn begins to warp his perceptions of reality. Get it? Nah, of course you don't. You're not going to let a one-sentence plot description and, if you own the Criterion Collection DVD, the three essays included deter you from watching it, are you?You're also not going to let scenes of grisly torture, unspeakable violence, murder, ""flesh guns,"" human VCRs, exploding cancer-deaths (poor Leslie Carlson as Barry Convex), pulsating video cassettes, Deborah Harry in S&M and morphing televisions turn you away, are you? What's more, you're not going to let Woods's effectively ""wooden"" performance here (his sticking his face into a ""living"" television) turn you away either?I won't even try to pretend I understood what was going through Cronenberg's mind when he wrote and directed this picture. I also won't pretend I understood the essays included with the DVD (and I don't think the writers did either). It's warped, it's perverted, it's depraved, and it's insanely intriguing and fascinating. The masses are frightened by ""Videodrome"" and with good reason. ""Videodrome"" is Cronenberg's dastardly take on mass-media consumption during a time when television was afraid... afraid to be real. Media violence had not yet become a major issue in America and hypocritical politicians weren't condemning it. But keep in mind this film was made in '83, years before the mind-blowing reality-morphing of ""The Matrix"" (1999).There's a little more that I think I can get away with in describing the plot, and Renn eventually traces the signal to Pittsburgh, and is introduced to the station's enigmatic programmer Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley) and his daughter Bianca (Sonja Smits). He learns of the bizarre nature surrounding Videodrome, and the fate of those of who watch it. As he becomes more and more obsessed, he finds it nearly impossible to turn it off, or turn away. Then those mutations and hallucinations Cronenberg is famous for start happening and when that does, things become nasty and the queasy may want to keep a finger on the fast-forward button. It's no secret Cronenberg loves torturing his protagonists and here, the ""new flesh"" wants to live long and Woods has the nice warm body perfect for it - he becomes a literal media assassin with a vaginal slit in his stomach that doubles as a programmable VCR and also has a handgun fused to his wrist - he's a virtual slave to Videodrome.Lastly, the eerie, driving score by Howard Shore swells up during the film's most intense and surreal moments, the most lovely being Woods's lovemaking with his television. I always watch Cronenberg films at least partially for Shore's music. Now I know why Cronenberg selects him for his soundtracks.""Videodrome,"" I think, has a lot more relevance today than it did 22 years ago. It's more visceral than gross, is quite brilliant, and doesn't spare us graphic violence and gore. It's alive, it's ""Videodrome.""8/10",Videodrome

52,mjneu59,schlock value,6,13 January 2011,"Media manipulation and mind control are the subjects of shock-master David Cronenberg's bizarre satirical fantasy, and his treatment of the well-worn topic is unorthodox, to say the least. James Woods (in a typically intense performance) stars as a cable TV pornographer who stumbles upon the mysterious transmission of a hardcore S&M program, exposure to which can cause wild hallucinations and horrifying physical mutations. So begins his evolution into 'the new flesh', a creature that can be programmed much like any videocassette recorder, but with far more disgusting visceral detail. Probably the only person to whom any of this makes sense is Cronenberg himself, who shies away from a tidy resolution by letting the plot degenerate into an exhibition of messy special effects. Whatever topical message the film might have had is beside the point: the only real reason to recommend it is for the gratuitous thrill of watching bodies erupt into putrescence.",Videodrome
53,drqshadow-reviews,Creepy and Creative But Also Meandering and Goofy,3,19 August 2013,"A dash of Canadian sci-fi / horror schlock that's very much a product of its era. James Woods and Deborah Harry (yes, *that* Deborah Harry) play a pair of masochistic voyeurs in search of a new thrill, which they find in the form of a pirated snuff TV station. The plot staggers this way and that, bouncing without pause from '60s comic book cheesiness (one of the primary foils is dubbed Professor Brian Oblivion) to insane, grotesque '80s gore effects (Woods's character sprouts a jumbo-sized vulva in his chest, then feeds it videotapes). For roughly the first thirty minutes it's actually a legitimate, if silly, gripe about the dangers of an over-stimulated society, but once its imagery begins to venture into the surreal it really loses the plot. Woods's abdominal slit is just the tip of the iceberg. Occasionally enjoyable as a ridiculous display of bad taste and hilarious special effects, it grossly belabors its only point and fails to reward courageous viewers with the first hint of a resolution.",Videodrome

However, when his colleague Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) discovers a new pirate channel called Videodrome and after Max watches footage from this pirate channel, his life begins to take on a bizarre twist of its own.I'll admit that this film intrigued me and there's certainly nothing wrong with the concept, but the problem that I had with this film is that once the concept has been established, Cronenberg doesn't seem to know which direction to take the film in. Whilst watching Videodrome, I was scratching my head trying to think what point Cronenberg was trying to make? I mean, it's too bizarre to be a social commentary, on the other hand perhaps Cronenberg was poking fun at greedy cable TV bosses and in making Renn the victim of Videodrome is in fact making some sort of comment about 'over-indulgence' and basically makes Renn 'reap' what he 'sows'. However, the vague narrative that's in this film doesn't really make it clear what point it's trying to make so I suspect many viewers will be at a loss in this respect.Aside from the vague and weak narrative, there was also no character development meaning that I didn't care what happened to anyone in this film. There also wasn't really much of a story (which is a shame because the concept was fantastic). I also felt that Cronenberg created many shocking set pieces in order to try to compensate for the weak story - some scenes were shocking, but some scenes towards the end were actually quite laughable. Factor all of the above in with perpetual boredom and you've got yourself a fairly sub-standard film.This is probably something of a cult film which will ultimately mean that it probably has a cult following, but for me it was a bizarre and somewhat strange film that didn't seem to have a point to it.",Videodrome

Long Live the New Flesh!""",9,12 November 2020,"Although it can play with some predictable elements, Videodrome is anything but an average filmgoing experience, as well as one of the most creative and important sci-fi flicks of all time. Videodrome is one of Cronenberg's biggest successes, and some even consider it to be his best work. His directorial skills are certainly impressive, with his creative efforts proving him to be a driving force on the big screen. Its script is complex, complicated, and superbly interesting- not to mention its fascinating social commentary and story which proves to do what no other film dares to try. The acting is rather good, James Woods, Sonja Smits, Leslie Carlson and Debbie Harry proving to be the films strongest components- although there isn't necessarily any standouts. The film isn't necessarily special with its look or cinematography, although its special effects are certainly groundbreaking and incredibly creative, not to mention certainly gruesome. It has a bit of a pacing issue, feeling like more of a slow burn, but due to its great directing from Cronenberg, well crafted story, and some unforgettable lines- Videodrome more than proves itself as a worthy film to watch. It's a complicated endeavor full of many complex ideas, you may not understand every moment of it, the film may even require a rewatch or two, but in there there is no denying this films creative genius.

58,Jonny_Numb,a stunning mindbender on par with David Lynch's best,8,8 September 2003,"""Videodrome"" is one of David Cronenberg's most highly-praised films, and also the one I had the most trouble warming up to.  Much like the works of Lynch, the enjoyment or satisfaction to be derived from the movie depends highly on the viewer's mood.  Whereas Lynch employs a fuzzy, dreamlike (neurological) structure (of lack thereof) to his films, Cronenberg attacks from both a neurological and biological perspective in ""Videodrome."" Murderous hallucinations, weapons grafting themselves onto body parts, and the blurred line between what is real and what isn't all come into play, and are interwoven with such skill that every tiny, nuanced detail seems to figure into the bigger picture of unlocking the secret behind ""Videodrome."" Cronenberg is just vague enough so that the viewer is left to piece together the clues and how they relate to one another, which means any easily-challenged viewers should stay away from this.  However, if you appreciate the puzzles of, say, ""Eraserhead"" or ""Mulholland Drive,"" you'll find much to stimulate the neural floodgates in ""Videodrome.""7.5/10",Videodrome
59,ShootingShark,Long Live The New Flesh,8,5 January 2011,"Max Renn is a cable TV exec looking for something shocking to boost his ratings. He discovers an underground torture show called Videodrome and tries to track its makers down, but starts to suffer from disturbing hallucinations. Is he losing his mind ?If there's such a thing as the Definitive Cronenberg Film, I think Videodrome is it. It's scary, it's profound, it's full of crazy ideas about society, sexuality and mortality, it has a funny undercurrent and it's like nothing else you've ever seen. Viewed thirty years after it was made it still seems incredibly prescient, despite the fact that all that chunky old VCR technology has gone the way of all flesh - reality TV, countless satellite stations peddling cheap shows, twenty-four hour news, so-called celebrities who seem to spend their entire futile lives on-camera. When Brian O'Blivion quips, ""Television is reality, and reality is less than television."", he's sadly all too right. But the movie is more than just a Marshall McLuhan thesis, it's several other things too - a gumshoe adventure as our hero uncovers a take-over-the-world conspiracy, a personal odyssey of philosophical discovery, a weird kind of comedy featuring goofy Japanese sex shows and an incredibly tacky spectacle manufacturing trade convention, an action piece as Max is first programmed to further a right-wing cause and then reprogrammed to stop it. It's also kind of an enormous joke as well - Cronenberg was/is always plagued with censorship and moralistic media problems and criticisms, so here he expands on what might happen if his detractors were right, albeit in his own inimitable way. What is particularly enjoyable about it is that from the moment Max watches the first Videodrome tape (in the seventh minute), almost nothing can be taken literally and the film keeps playing with both Max's reality and our own, typified by the bravura where-did-that-gun-go sequence. The movie blows our minds visually via Rick Baker's incredible make-up effects (where else could you see a man making love to a TV set) but even more so in the conceptual sense; at first we simply assume what Max is seeing isn't real, then we realise all film and TV encompasses that idea, then we start to transcend to some other plane of reality. It's terrific stuff. Woods is incredibly good here, one of those rare right-time-right-place this-part-was-made-for-me occasions - Max is a slightly sleazy realist, so when he is confronted by these radical new socio-political ideas his wry reactions are both intriguing and amusing. Woods fills his performance with funny quips (""See you in Pittsburgh !"") and throwaway observations, somehow managing to make a very disturbing story which ends in suicide much more palatable and entertaining without detracting from its potency. A red-headed Harry (the singer from classic rock band Blondie) is totally iconic as the masochistic, fun-loving, dangerous-to-know Nicki; if there were some checklist to create the perfect cult movie performance she'd tick every box, probably twice, and she's unforgettable. The support cast fill out their (invariably creepy) roles with sinister aplomb, particularly Carlson and Dvorsky (both of whom also have nice bits in The Dead Zone) as the two chief villains. As with almost all of Cronenberg's work, Carol Spier's art direction and Howard Shore's music are evocatively grim and downbeat and add tremendously to the bleak atmosphere. It's impossible to sum this movie up, except to say that it's unlike any other film, it's one of the best and most imaginative horror pictures every made, and is a fantastic distillation of the unique mind that is David Paul Cronenberg.",Videodrome
60,Samiam3,"Long live the new flesh, and Cronenberg",8,4 June 2009,"I think this is the best of Cronenberg's early films (by early I mean the ones that pre-date 'The Fly') It is almost impossible to briefly summarize the plot of this eccentric cult flick, but the message of Videodrome is a warning that television can be seductive and if you become a product of it, it can destroy your life. Cronenberg, makes this literal in Videodrome, James Woods' character (a quirky TV programer) actually gets seduced and subsequently programed by television itself. There is something very visually brilliant about the still image of Woods sticking his face into the pair of giant lips on the TV screen. The acting is nothing special, but that's okay, because it's not really a character oriented story. The focus is on the message.Movie goers will love this one, and probably all other Cronenberg films as well. If you are gonna see this, might as well try them all.",Videodrome

The Best Film of Cronenberg that I Have Seen,10,25 April 2008,"""Videodrome"" has many unforgettable scenes with James Woods as the main character Max Renn and Deborah Harry as the strange Nicki Brand. Since a unique sex scene with sadomasochistic acts in which Deborah Harry is so damn sexy to that scene with James Woods entering into a television screen that is showing the lips of Nicki, perhaps the most famous scene of the film. These brilliant scenes are unforgettable because of the great visual part of the film with terrific effects in the most bizarre scenes you can imagine but mostly because of what this images represents according to the amazingly bizarre and really visionary script, written by the great David Cronenberg. The story introduce to you the character played by James Woods, who is the president of CIVIC TV, a little television station that shows since soft porn to tough violence. Max is looking out for a new show and his work partner Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) shows to him Videodrome, a show without any plot and characters just torture and murder. In this part, the first of the film, Max is just really interested in Videodrome and also the idea of Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley) that ""the television screen is the retina of the mind's eye"" is very well represented with the fact that the shows of Max's television station were motive of debates about how possible is that this kind of shows determinate the behavior of the society. And that idea comes from Videodrome. The concept of Videodrome is quite interesting because of the fact that it can control the mid of the viewer and change the body, but why the people watch a scum show like Videodrome? Cronenber did this film in 1983 and now, after 25 years, the concept of television is just perfect for our days because finally the television show to us what they want and will be always the most manipulative media. Cast: is just brilliant. James Woods is so great in one of my personal favourites performances of him. ""Blondie"" is also great with a small role but a very sexy one. Her scenes are unforgettable and for me this is her best role.Conclusion: Well, this is a really great and really bizarre film that you will never forget. It could be really confused mostly because the mix of the hallucinations with the reality but is really enjoyable and will keep you in alert all of it's 87 minutes of runtime. Until now I have seen a pretty decent number of Cronenberg films, mostly his work of the 80's and two of his 3 films of the 00's: ""Spider"" and ""A History of Violence"", and ""Videodrome"" is definitely my favourite and for me his best film. 10 out of 10Region 4 DVD: the single-disc edition released by Universal Pictures doesn't contain any extra material just the theatrical trailer that is really funny to watch. Reading about all the extra material that the Criterion Collection edition contains just left me a lot of desires to get it; it seems that is a really worthy purchase since Universal or any other company hasn't released a special edition for this film.",Videodrome

64,p-stepien,Birth of a master,8,10 September 2012,"When a cable TV-manager Max Renn (James Woods) embarks on a venture into the next new craze, beyond soft porn or cheap horrors, his hacker employee Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) stumbles upon an scrambled feed of a show called Videodrome featuring torture, sexual deviance and ultimately murder. Apparently feeding from Pittsburgh Max as well as his sadomasochistic lover Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry) develop an undying addiction to the show, irregardless of whether or not it is in fact snuff video. Enchanted Max decides to acquire the show for his programming, searching out the enigmatic preacher of the 'new flesh' professor Barry O'blivion as somehow connected to the show. Soon however reality begins to unravel as Videodrome's subliminal message causes detachment and hallucinations. This new perception of Max skews his mind with dire reality-warping consequences...David Cronenberg already strongly announced his arrival with audacious horror flicks, characterised by his cold unrelentless touch, sleazy surrealism and naturalistic touch. But ""Videodrome"" in fact is his first adventure into more artistic cinema, albeit one still drenched in mucus and guts, obviously garnering to fans of his previous body of work. This surrealistic technoorganic thriller still makes a repulsive impression over almost 30 years after being conceived. All in all 80s prosthetics, dim lighting, decrepit aesthetics and faded, almost murky, colours seem more suited to Cronenberg's directorial style, than the CGI flared colour perfection of current cinema, which could explain the ultimate disappointment of ""ExistenZ"", which despite a similar story derails into a self-parody.Evidently filmed with body horror audience in mind with a fast hard-hitting and adequately convoluted plot (and an occasional corny one-liner to get the plot going), ""Videodrome"" nonetheless presents viewers with various underlying themes, peculiarly reminiscent of those analyzed in ""Funny Games"" (1997). Two central themes to the story and the adjacent social commentary actually peculiarly offer the same questions and answers. At one point Max is confronted with reasons behind watching Videodrome snuff, albeit visibly a question also pointed towards the viewer (much like ""Funny Games"" breaking of the fourth wall). The second situation involves video and reality, the blurring of the lines. The retina catches signals and for the mind they are real, irrelevant of whether or not it is merely capturing a television screen, summarised poignantly in the movie: ""Television is reality, and reality is less than television."" (recalled in the final conversation by Paul and Peter in ""Funny Games""). Cronenberg draws a similar conclusion, suggesting media's role in violence and pointing out our culpability for agreeing to it. Furthermore ""Videodrome"" seems like an overt statement of interest, themes that recur over the years and are further analysed and commented upon.Nonetheless Cronenberg, while dealing with the same issues, avoids the pitfall of pretentiousness and double morality of Michael Haneke, honestly presenting his point of view, but not lecturing the audience. For those not interested in the message ""Videodrome"" also offers a great wacky story with an uncompromising ending to die for. Conveying emotion and psychology on top of gore and grotesque machinations (breathing videotapes, having sex with a television or feeding a gun to Max's belly), Cronenberg still outdoes the contemporary director, overly focused on packaging, not nearly aware enough of style and content. A movie so essentially Cronenberg, that you can't imagine anyone else ever making it...",Videodrome
65,PredragReviews,"""Television is reality""",9,4 May 2016,"Videodrome is a classic sci/fi horror film from David Cronenberg which stars James Woods in what has to be his best role as a T.V. producer in the not too distant future. Woods turns in another great performance, and the cast is appropriate. Cronenberg paces this very well, and can make the film scary without having to have someone suddenly jump out with a knife. Also notable are the effects by a rising Rick Baker and the score by Howard Shore. Plus, this is one of the first films to explore the possibility of TV influence on the masses, only that taking it to another more demented level. The story's highly original and is filled with bizarre imagery, looking at it from today's standpoint it's unsettling how prophetic the movie was.Cronenberg gathered many parts of a script and ideas together to create a near avant-garde film that uses TV and fanatical programmers as villains. Suffice to say that what starts out as an already interesting and challenging portrait of a soft-porn Cable-TV station owner looking for the next big thing in the adult entertainment world evolves into a nightmare that relentlessly never eases until the very last frame. his film was ahead of its time by decades and is still a significant movie using TV/Media as the vehicle for great evil, as prompted by an already receptive audience. Cronenberg suggests that we have created a TV Pornographic Frankenstein that is out of control.So, this is as close as it gets to a morality tale of one man's descent into hell, but it's also an outrageously twisted glimpse at what might happen when broadcast media becomes completely unregulated - pretty far-sighted in 1983. Almost thirty years further down the line, you'll still need a Kevlar-coated stomach to fully appreciate the film's 'message', but it's worth it.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Videodrome

69,mentalcritic,Long live the new flesh!,10,4 August 2006,"David Cronenberg has turned out a lot of films that range from the bizarre to the slightly less bizarre to the stupefying. I used to think that his update of The Fly was his masterwork, as it certainly is an improvement over the original in every sense of the word. Videodrome, however, is entirely his idea, and what an idea it is. Filmed at a time when VHS and Betamax were still at war for market share, and television was still beholden to some standard of public service, it is hard to imagine what the public of 1983 made of Videodrome. Twenty-three years on, it looks so prophetic that it is truly a wonder Sony or Toshiba are not employing Cronenberg to attempt to anticipate consumer reaction to their consumer format ideas. Shot in a Lynchian shoot-first, work-out-story-later manner, it is testament to Cronenberg's skills as a storyteller that the 'drome works as well as it does. It is also testament to the film's accuracy that in this era of so-called reality television, nobody in a remake-crazed system is trying to remake Videodrome.Of course, in a film with a theme as speculative as Videodrome, one needs to have a reliable performer. Just like you cannot portray someone going mad with fear a la The Fly if your actor is not up to snuff, one cannot portray a weird conspiracy without an actor of James Woods' calibre. Everything that occurs on the screen from about thirty minutes in is utterly unbelievable, but we buy it because James is so good at selling it to us. His disbelief graduating into terror graduating into acceptance is the rock upon which Videodrome rests, and the respect he gained from me in my recent viewing of Once Upon A Time In America went through the atmosphere during Videodrome. So many films are made with a singular star as its entire focus. Sylvester Stallone made a few, but Woods demonstrates he is more than up to the challenge here. The James Woods of the 1980s and the James Woods post 1990 are really two different people, or so one might think after seeing a film from both groups.The support cast are mostly adequate, with Deborah Harry demonstrating she could have been an actor. Not that she does anything particularly brilliant here, but she also manages to keep her part of the illusion solid. Sonja Smits helps twist the plot beyond its already unrecognisable shape as the daughter of one of the conspirators in the Videodrome experiment. While these two are secondary to Woods, they also add so much to the story that its hard to imagine the film without them. The world was changing in ways none could have imagined at the time, and as Harry's musical career was left in the cold as a result, her image in this film is iconic of an era. Jack Creley is puzzling as a guru tied into the conspiracy who appears only in video. To cut a long story short, Woods is a pinball, while Harry, Smits, and Creley are the bumpers off which he bounces. In that task, they do a brilliant job, and they are far from the only ones. Videodrome contains a literal cavalcade of actors one wishes they could see more of, just based on their moments here.The summary in a previous comment says it best: ""I don't think I could provide spoilers if I wanted to"". I could tell you everything that happens in Videodrome, and it still will not even slightly prepare you for the utter bizarreness to be beheld. The imagery is both disgusting and strangely compelling, the story is beyond odd, and the references to the ""new flesh"" that pop up like skin cancer cells in the final reels are a mantra that will haunt the viewer long after the film is over. The constant images of videotapes and televisions flexing out to either imitate organic material or swallow the hero whole. It is the ultimate contradiction, that I can find this film so utterly compelling yet so utterly repulsive. There is an unofficial motto among defense lawyers: ""if you cannot convince them, confuse them"". Videodrome, thanks to its surreal imagery and story that could only be inspired by divergent thought, is both convincing and confusing. Such is the ultimate achievement in storytelling.Fortunately, the question of whether one can separate their perception of reality from the fantasy they see depicted on a video source has been answered already. It isn't really even a question that needs asking here, as it has long been answered by film. No, Videodrome is about something more, although exactly what that is could be anything David Cronenberg desires. I chose to see it as an example of one man getting so wrapped up in his ideas or fantasies that they utterly distort his reality, an idea subtly hinted at when one character describes his hallucinations causing him a brain tumour rather than the other way around. The new flesh is the idea that drives a given machine, always mutating and altering itself. However you choose to interpret the story of Videodrome, I think the consensus we can all come to is that it is just plain odd. Most of us will never really see the things shown in Videodrome if we take a mix of heroin, crack, and LSD then wash it down with drain cleaner.It is mostly for these reasons that I gave Videodrome a ten out of ten. You have not stretched your imagination far enough if you are completely repulsed by its imagery. Do yourself a favour and see it now. Long live the new flesh.",Videodrome
70,mattymatt4ever,Catered for the sci-fi lovers,3,30 March 2001,"I thought the film had an intriguing premise, and could've been put to good use, instead of molding it into a silly, confusing, contrived journey to sci-fi oblivion.  I don't know what is it with most sci-fi writers.  They think a movie has to be convoluted to the highest power to be interesting. A movie like E.T. took a simple idea and went a long way, and that's one of the greatest sci-fi flicks of all time.  I've never been a Cronenberg fan. I think he pushes to the extreme so much that it just plays like a 90-minute extension of a sick fantasy.  Cronenberg doesn't allow blood to just spray out of someone's head when getting shot, he has to have a puddle of blood. I don't know the guy personally, but I have the feeling he might be a sadist.  On the bright side of this sick fantasy, Deborah Harry did take her clothes off.  She has a terrific body!  She has a great pair of breasts, and it's too bad Cronenberg had to ruin it by having them burned with a cigarette butt.  I like the setup of the film, and actually thought it was going to lead somewhere.  But once it surpassed the 30-minute mark, it shifted to sci-fi silliness and contrivance.  I wasn't excited, I wasn't scared, but I was very creeped out.  This movie almost made me hurl at points.

James Woods stars as Max Renn, a sleazy TV executive who stumbles upon a fuzzy television broadcast called Videodrome that shows torture and murder with no discernible plot or characters. Intrigued by this, Max sets out to find out more about Videodrome, and the truth is more than he ever could have bargained for as he finds his life consumed by this television as he stares into the bleak future of media and his own life.Videodrome is everything you'd expect from a Cronenberg film. It's incredibly weird in a disturbing existential way and it's loaded with gruesome special effects that will make you cringe while simultaneously being incredibly fascinated. Videodrome is a film that plays on our fascination with the abomination and our love of the grotesque which, ironically, is a central theme of the film itself. It's clever writing and devious filmmaking that shocks us with a purpose. It's disturbing with a point. That point is that people will watch anything, no matter how pointless or disgusting and you can make money off of the most vile of things. Videodrome is a film that works on many multiple levels.The film is also, in a word, crazy. It starts out simple enough but the more we learn about what Max is getting himself into the farther over the deep end the film goes. The more bizarre and the more difficult to follow it goes. But it's horrifically intelligent the whole way through, and the creepy weirdness of it is what makes it great. Even if you can't understand everything on the first viewing there's something so horribly fascinating about the whole film that you want to know all and you want to know more. Through a gruesomely unique story and disgusting visuals Cronenberg has made himself a film for the ages with Videodrome.",Videodrome

74,Bob-45,"More ""Manchurian"" Than ""Matrix""",9,6 June 2006,"Had I been a studio head 25 years ago or a critic 23 years ago, I would have said, ""'Videodrome' is the biggest load of horse apples I've ever seen."" However, in this age of ""Survivor,"" ""Fear Factor,"" ""Xtreme Fighting,"" ""Terry Schiavo,"" ""Ruby Ridge,"" ""Waco,"" ""Koscovo"" and now ""Iraq,"" I see David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" as a ""prophetic view of the present"" and near masterpiece.Max Renn (James Woods) is the head of gonzo television channel 83, whose product mix of sex and violence is about to undergo a steep upgrade. For Max's video pirate connection has discovered ""Videodrome,"" a channel programmed with nonstop, unmotivated torture and murder. While a talk show guest, Max meets Nikki (Deborah Harry), a specialist in abnormal psychology, and is ""introduced"" (via telecast) to ""Dr. O'Blivion,"" a ""Marshall McLuhanesque"" media prophet. Max is fascinated with Nikki, particularly when he discovers Nikki is as kinky has he is. Max shows Nikki the ""Videodrome"" bootleg, and Nikki reveals she wants to be a contestant on ""Videodrome"" and plans to visit Pittsburgh, where the programming is broadcast.WARNING: SPOILERS To reveal more would spoil the film, but for those baffled by what follows, here is my interpretation. Max was selected to be programmed by ""Videodrome"". It was a lie that anyone who watched the tape would be affected. Max was singled out because his psychological profile made him an ideal candidate as a ""sleeper"" assassin. Neither Max nor ""Dr. O'Blivion"" ever had a tumor. Max was simply easier to manipulate by allowing him to associate his psychosis with a physiological ailment. Max inserting the gun into his abdomen was an induced hallucination. He simply could no longer see the gun and, hence, could not control it. By the time Max ""removed"" the gun from his abdomen, Max was under so much external control he was no longer capable of controlling his behavior. The gun became an extension of his body, and that's how it appeared to him. Likewise, inserting the videotape indicated he was receiving further programming. When Max shot his enemies, they did not really ""explode"" or ""decompose."" These were illusions meant to desensitize Max by removing his victims from his consciousness, and venting Max's rage. It's likely that Nikki was not murdered, but was a co-conspirator from ""Videodrome"". It's quite possible Max didn't kill anybody; but, if he did, he killed two rogue Videodrome agents on behalf of Nikki and the O'Blivions. Max needed to believe he was being physically transformed, so that he would accept suicide as a step to the next level of reality. This is a common brainwashing technique (witness Jim Jones and the ""space alien"" cult mass suicides.) Max was a test subject who was eliminated when he was no longer useful and to protect the secret of Videodrome until it was ready for mass market. We've been conditioned for it ever since.Had I seen ""Videodrome"" in 1981, I'd have given it a ""3"". In 1983, I'd have given it a ""4"". However, it's 2006 and I give ""Videodrome"" a ""9"".",Videodrome
75,jluis1984,Brutal Surrealism!,10,17 February 2006,"David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" is a one way ticket to madness where, in the words of mysterious character, Dr. O'Blivion, ""Television is reality, and reality is less than Television"". This masterpiece is a brilliant mixture of horror and sci-fi that pushes both genres beyond and takes them to a new level.James Woods plays Max Renn, the director of an independent TV station that is always looking for a new way to shock his audience. Almost by accident, he fins ""Videodrome"", which apparently is a real snuff TV show where people is murdered on screen. At the same time, he starts dating Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), a radio DJ with an obsession with pain. After Nicki decides to see if what happens in ""Videodrome"" is real, Max's sanity becomes unstable; and as he becomes more and more obsessed with ""Videodrome"", he decides to discover what is going on before its too late.""Videodrome"" is a very complex story of obsession and altered mind states; as Max Renn is affected by the influence of ""Videodrome"", his hallucinations become more and more real and soon the fine line between reality and TV is completely lost. This kind of complexity is both its greatest strength and its greatest flaw, the movie may not be appealing to everyone, but those who like a challenging movie will be pleased with Cronenberg's masterpiece.The movie makes a metaphor of the influence of TV over people, and the script uses heavy symbolism in its approach. Using from mind-control to gruesome body mutations, the idea of the TV used as a weapon becomes a central part of the movie and Cronenberg handles the topic with a not so subtle approach that at times is haunting, at others disturbing, but never fails to keep the tension to the max. It is a very accomplished script that seems the incarnation of modern nightmares.Cronenberg's vision of TV-influenced people would not be the same without the superb performance of James Woods. He makes a great job as a man who is completely self-confident until he discovers a world bigger than anything he knew before. He is entering a strange land and us, the audience, follow his steps as he gets trapped in this bizarre world of mind control and TV-based religions. This is one of Wood's best performances indeed.Not only Woods makes a good work, Deborah Harry gives a fine performance as Renn's object of desire, and Jack Creley is fantastic as the strange Dr. O'Blivion. Also, credit must go to the SFX team, who created some of the most frightening hallucinations in cinema history. More than 20 years after its release and many of the effects used in the movie still are as shocking as the first time.""Videodrome"", is not a simple movie, it is a masterpiece of modern cinema and a movie worthy of a look. While it probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, it is a thought-provoking metaphor of the power of TV. 10/10. Classic.",Videodrome
76,cchase,"""Medium HELL""...",9,4 December 2008,"""Careful. It bites."" --Bianca O'BlivionNever destined to share the same niche as most populist filmmakers, David Cronenberg's aim is always to challenge the audience while chilling them. His overall motto in regard to man's relationship with an ever-more chaotic, technologically-obsessed world seems to be: As we are consumers, so are we consumed. And nowhere is this maxim made more apparent than in VIDEODROME, the dark place where our deepest desires of the psyche and the flesh commingle with the new gadgets and geegaws we have created to give us freer and easier access to them. In one of his most bravura performances, James Woods portrays Max Renn, the director of programming and operations of a cable station dealing with low-grade sleaze, (think ""Skinamax,"" ""'Ho'time"" or ""H-B-'Hoes After Dark,"" but as a complete station of soft-core smut.) In a fiercely competitive market, Max is ever on the look-out for the next big thing that will send the ratings through the roof, and he thinks he's found it in a remotely- broadcast, independently produced shock-show known only as ""Videodrome."" This is basic cable at its basest, as various male and (mostly) female victims are gruesomely tortured, raped and murdered against a stark backdrop. And that is the entire premise of the show.Max becomes increasingly fascinated then completely obsessed with the show, even drawing his girlfriend into it, the sexually over-stimulated radio pop-psychologist Nicki Brand, (a star-making turn by Blondie's front-mistress Deborah (""Debbie"") Harry). As repeated viewings begin to distort Max's view of the world and those he interacts with in it, he soon discovers that TV can indeed warp your brain, but in new and terrifying ways that most of us have never even considered.The themes of corporate greed, brainwashing, cultism, paranoia and technology run amok are thoroughly explored to maximum advantage as Max Renn transforms from a nondescript sleaze-peddler, to the psychologically-ravaged pawn caught in the middle of a bizarre power struggle, in which 'reality TV' takes on a whole new definition. If the old saying 'you are what you eat' can also be extended to our brains, then VIDEODROME is here to show us exactly what that is in terms of our symbiotic and cannibalistic relationship with the media, and it is by no means a pretty sight.Even more startling, is the film's refusal to ground us in a base of ""reality"" that we can accept and understand. Is there really a holy war being fought for possession and control of ""The New Flesh,"" or has Max gone so totally insane that everything he goes through is happening only in his fractured mind?That, happy viewer, is up to you to decide. Just don't put your face or any body parts too close to your T.V. screenThere's a lot more to worry about there than just ruining your eyes",Videodrome

He thinks its a shows but soon wonders if it is actullay staged. As he watched the videos things start to happen to his sanityThis movie started off good. It was pretty interesting and a new idea.

79,Superunknovvn,Wonderfully weird and quite prophetic,7,13 November 2005,"David Cronenberg has always been a pioneer, who never gave a damn about commercial success. He's never worked on a project out of anything else than artistic conviction. It's hard to believe that a movie as far out as ""Videodrome"" ever got made and that it got made as well as it turned out to be.Max Renn is a T.V. producer in the not too distant future. Being the successful business man that he is, Max knows that only the most perverted, violent and brutal shows evoke any real interest among viewers. One day he comes across a mysterious show called ""Videodrome"", which goes further than everything else he's ever seen before. It soon becomes clear that ""Videodrome"" is much more than just a T.V. show, something a lot more dangerous. Before he knows it Max is caught up in the whole thing and the line between reality and hallucination is blurring.""Videodrome"" unites a wonderful cast and some of the best special effects of the early 80's. It's amazing what Cronenberg's team does with such a low budget. The story's highly original and looking at it from today's standpoint it's unsettling how prophetic the movie was. We've already reached a level where we're able to look at the sickest kind of crimes and abuse through the internet. That part of the movie is no longer utopia, it's already become real, which is kinda scary. Cronenberg would later update this movie by making ""eXistenZ"", a variation of the same topic. ""Videodrome"" still holds up very well, though, which can't be said about many Sci-Fi movies of the 80's.",Videodrome

He gets some more pirated videos of the show and his girlfriend (Debroah Harry) wants to audition to be a star on that show until two weeks later it seems she hasn't returned.

After the success of ""Scanners"" (Great movie BTW), David Cronenberg wrote and directed this very cerebral but compelling film about technology gone haywire and the dangers of watching dangerously violent pornography. The performances are quite astounding even Woods is practically perfect playing the role, the story is quite original yet bizarre and the film does have some disturbing images of S&M and gore shown thanks to the magic of Rick Baker.

84,Antagonisten,One of Cronenbergs best,8,10 January 2005,"I just saw this movie for the third time the other night. And then it hit me what a great piece of cinema this is. One of my personal Cronenberg favorites for sure, but also one of the best in it's genre.Max Renn (James Woods) is a program director for a small cable channel that has specialized in explicit material. One day one of his employees finds something using his satellite dish, something it seems no one should be able to see. It's a broadcast of a young woman being tortured and murdered. The program is called ""Videodrome"" and it immediately catches Max' attention. Soon though he finds out that Videodrome is not what it seems.I don't know what it is that David Cronenberg has. But it's something that leaves me with a queasy feeling in my gut every time i watch one of his movies. But while they are unpleasant they are also hugely fascinating. Much in the same way that Max Renn in Videodrome is drawn to the violence on-screen while at the same time repulsed by it. I will not try to analyze whether this is David Cronenbergs comment on a society that is becoming more and more used to violence, or if it is just another of his ventures into a world where man and machine are ultimately merging into one. Rather i would leave that interpretation up to the viewer, because this is certainly a movie that stayed with me for a while.James Woods is excellent as usual and the effects are good (at least if you keep in mind that this movie is over 20 years old). But mostly what impresses me is the way that Videodrome mixes ingredients like violence, sex and hallucinations to create something unique that in my opinion never feels like exploitation.I rate it 8/10.",Videodrome

Renn and his girlfriend Nicki (Debbie Harry) are keen to indulge as they descend further into their S&M fantasies. Both are fascinated with a tape of a new show, Videodrome. Renn by the marketability, Nicki by the danger. Renn thinks it's fake, an act, a captivating mirage. He wants to track its origin and bring it to his TV Channel lost at the end of the dial. Woods is disarming on screen, worryingly believable, like he's playing himself. Despite the subject and tone, the opening act feels very lofi, diy, straight to VHS. But as Renn's reality begins to blur, the gloves come off, allowing Cronenberg to paint a nightmarish celluloid vision. Televisions breathe, Renn loses his gun inside a vaginal like hole in his stomach, the body horror effects are gory and glorious. It's dark and dirty, without ever becoming scuzzy. The plot remains miraculously on track throughout. Max realises that he's responsible for the trap he finds himself in and sets about finding some sort of redemption, ""Death to Videodrome, long live the new flesh!""

But what does it all mean?Videodrome is a film that has long divided critics and audiences alike. Andy Worhol declared Videodrome the Clockwork Orange (1971) of the 80's, yet Roger Ebert called it one of the LEAST entertaining movies ever. Well, that's Ebert for ya. I however adore this film and gladly hail it as one of the most unique psychological thrillers ever! Videodrome is a film that was quite ahead of it's time when it came out. Most of Cronenberg's films have some kind of warning to society and with Videodrome the warning is about the power and influence of the media upon the human mind.The story is both engaging and haunting. Cronenberg's direction is slickly-done as always giving this film an atmosphere of dread and mystery. The special FX, courtesy of makeup master Rick Baker, are stunningly good. Who could ever forget the scene where Max loses his gun... inside his stomach.The cast is good, James Woods does a dynamic performance, as does attractive supporting stars Sonja Smitts and Deborah Harry.Videodrome is a film quite unlike any other.

87,Java_Joe,"The first in the ""new flesh"" series.",7,23 July 2019,"David Cronenberg is mainly known for two things. The first is creating very inventive horror movies dealing with physical or psychological horror. The second is the concept of the ""new flesh"" which encompasses things like body horror and people changing. But it's from this movie that we have the classic line, ""long live the new flesh!"" This is a story of madness, obsession and how what we watch can change us in ways we might not have anticipated.James Woods plays Maxx Renn, the President of CIVIC-TV, a small UHF station who's main claim to fame is playing softcore porn and gruesome violence. This is based on the Toronto station CITY-TV which made a name for itself back in the 70's and 80's for playing what they called ""baby blue movies"" at night which were softcore porn. But Maxx is getting tired of this and wants something else so somebody turns him on to a pirate station called ""Videodrome"" which shows images of torture and the eventual murder of a person on screen. He sees this as the future and demands that it be broadcast on CIVIC-TV. This is where everything starts to go weird. There's parts in which fantasy and reality collide and you're not sure what you're seeing on the screen is real or not.To say too much would be to ruin the movie and this is one movie you really need to see fresh without any real knowledge of what happens later on.While not a great movie it is a good movie and it's a good starting point especially if you want to continue to see things like ""eXistenZ"".",Videodrome

89,domino1003,Flesh For Fantasy,9,15 June 2006,"To look at ""Videodrome"" today, you can call David Cronenberg a genius. Why? Because particular points that are made in the film had pretty much come true. Don't believe me? Check out the line that Brian O'Blivion (Jack Creley)says: "" Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television."" He mentions that everyone will have special names as a form of communication (The internet, anyone?).The only thing that Max Renn (James Woods)wants is something new and shocking. Max is a partner in a pirate-television station that shows smut, violence, etc. He stumbles upon a show called Videodrome, which seems to be good old fashioned torture and murder. Also intrigued is Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry), who disappears while trying to ""audition"" for it. As he begins to search for the source of Videodrome and the people who create it, Max begins to suffer from rather freaky hallucinations and stumbles onto a conspiracy in which he becomes a pawn.You can never really be sure how much is hallucination or reality, and maybe this is the point of the film: we become so engulfed in addictive forms of entertainment(Be it television, internet, or electronic game)that reality ceases to exist. Woods is great in this, but I wished that the ending would have been better, which leaves some loose ends, which become maddening.One of Cronenberg's best.",Videodrome
90,Flagrant-Baronessa,A freaky horrorshow with deeper meaning,6,29 July 2006,"I saw Videodrome at the 2005 Stockholm film festival and as we were sitting in the audience waiting for the show to begin, director David Cronenberg walks in and starts presenting the film. He tells us that it is about people's reaction to media violence and a look at how media catalyzes violence in society. I'm glad he told me, because none of this is really apparent in the film. In fact, I would probably have found Videdrome totally unwatchable had Cronenberg not clarified its message and thereby given me something--a purpose--to hold onto as I watched itSo while I'm desperately clinging onto this purpose, we get follow likably sleazy TV cable programmer Max Renn (James Woods) as he discovers a frequency on the television transmission that shows a forbidden show, Videodrome. This show appears to be airing from Malaysia and features some pretty messed up torture games that people either find sexual and else gratifying, I don't know, but all the viewers are mesmerized by its content and it ends up changing them. Things start to get real weird for Max as he is turned into some kind of pawn for Videodrome and he is torn between the forces that want to control the show, and the show itself.The plot outline of Videodrome is every bit as weird on screen as it sounds on page. It's often strangely entertaining, and I believe that is what Cronenberg wants to highlight -- the kind of perverse fascination that people have with television violence and gore. It is also about television broadcasters constantly on the edge, pushing for new daring concepts to shock the audience with. Because it is so ridiculously (I don't want to say 'gratuitously' - as I think it had a point) gory, I sat crouched behind my friend for the main part of the film, burying my head in her shoulder and feeling really woozy when Cronenberg carved out freak-overload in the form of James Woods PIERCING Debbie Harry (That's right, ""Blondie"") with a rusty needle. Sick.Ultimately, and no disrespect to Mr. Cronenberg, there is just no way in hell ordinary people could have gotten its message without having read several explanations, reviews and discussions to identify it first. At first viewing, Videodrome appears to be a complete mess of gore, violence and perversions -- a wacky, nonsensical horror flick with low-budget visual effects. It is meant as a dark parable for the media/TV age as well as an allegory for the nature of horror films -- but this is nearly impossible to tell.6/10",Videodrome
91,rdoyle29,A fine film ... just wish I liked it a bit more,8,12 May 2016,"This is a transitional film for Cronenberg. It's the last film he made that bears the marks of his early style, and it points to the direction he will eventually (but not immediately) go in. While I have great admiration for the ambition it displays, it doesn't completely succeed for me, and is one of my least favorite of his early films. Only ""Scanners"" really works even less for me. What he's doing here is very similar to what he does later in a film like ""Naked Lunch"", or even ""Spider"" I guess, where an unreliable narrator affects the film in ways that makes everything depicted questionable. My issue with ""Videodrome"" is that the reality of the film breaks down to the point that I don't think anyone can really say what's really happening in the last 20-40 minutes of the film. Is that a serious problem? No, and I still think it's a remarkable film, but I think Cronenberg demonstrates less control over this film and it's subject matter than he does over earlier and subsequent films.",Videodrome

Even a majority of the characters including James Woods as sleazy cable TV programmer Max Renn could not even hold my interest.Considering this movie was released in 1983, it is still extremely violent, nasty, unpleasant, and very bizarre.

93,TheExpatriate700,Videodrome Has A...Philosophy,8,3 January 2012,"Videodrome is a great sci-fi / horror film, combining great performances with excellent special effects and a thought-provoking story. It marks David Cronenberg's break from low budget, high concept gore films such as Rabid and Scanners to the big budget bloodbaths that characterized his eighties output. The film follows the downfall of Max Renn, played by James Woods, a sleazy cable executive who becomes addicted to a disturbing new program.It's hard to know where to begin when praising this film. Cronenberg assembled a truly excellent cast, particularly given the film's gruesome violent and sexual content. James Woods is great as Renn, conveying both his perverted obsessions and his anguish as his world descends into hallucinatory insanity. Deborah Harry is also good as a kinky radio host he falls in love with, lending the role needed sexual magnetism. Les Carlson is suitably slimy as an untrustworthy eyeglass manufacturer.The special effects are also top notch, demonstrating the superiority of practical hands on effects to the CGI cartoons we have now. Hallucinatory images such as a hand emerging from a television made flesh will stay with viewers long after the film has ended. The make up effects are also excellent, matching the transformations in Renn's mind with disturbing physical manifestations.The philosophical elements are somewhat more troublesome, as Cronenberg's interjection of them into the plot is more prominent, and consequently more awkward, than his previous work. In particular, the concept behind the Cathode Mission and its digitized founder, O'Blivion, seems ill thought out, and could have been better presented. Nevertheless, the film's commentary on television's influence on the public is genuinely interesting. It will definitely make you curious to read the works of Marshall McLuhan, upon whom O'Blivion was based.If possible, try to get the Criterion Collection edition of Videodrome. Aside from the usual making of pieces, it has several interesting commentaries from the actors, Cronenberg himself, and the special effects crew.",Videodrome
94,sunznc,Not one character to root for,5,27 June 2012,"I'm not sure what to think of this strange, strange film. It has the Cronenberg feel to it for sure. Low key performances, softly spoken actors, restrained (somewhat) acting. But it lacks something other Cronenberg films have and that is the ability to feel a connection to the characters, to be able to identify somewhat with them. Here, there isn't really anyone that we're rooting for. Everyone seems to have some sort of agenda that serves them and no one else even if we're not told what that is. It has a very cold feeling to it.The story and what happens isn't really all that interesting even though the concept, that elements of television or of a television have seeped into our society, and people feel that they can't live without it. Elements of this are prophetic in a way-what are people watching on their little hand-held devices all the time? Youtube, television, movies, videos. In a way, the film was ahead of it's time. It might actually anger people today because no one wants to admit they can't live ONE DAY without their little hand-held ""personal devices"". If Videodrome were made today would it fly? How would it be different?The acting here is not much of a stretch for anyone involved. Deborah Harry-is she acting? If so, did she deliberately make her character restrained? Or is she an amateur? The film itself has an amateurish feel to it at times. I've watched other Cronenberg films several times but I'm not convinced that one viewing isn't enough with this.",Videodrome
95,avik-basu1889,Science Fiction meets Body Horror !!!,9,3 August 2015,"David Cronenberg during the initial part of his career was primarily known for his body horror films. A consistent theme of his earlier films was the individual's loss of control over his/her body which involved bodies exploding, bodies decaying and other visually disgusting effects on a human body. Although 'Videodrome' does belong to Cronenberg's list of films dealing with body horror, but there is so much profundity that can be found in this film that I didn't find in his other early films. This film is a prime example to show how the genres of science fiction and horror can be beautifully and seamlessly linked/blended to make a resoundingly effective film.'Videodrome' was made in 1983. Back then, Television had just started to acquire a stronghold in the day to day lives of the urban masses. The story written by Cronenberg himself conveys a cautionary message about the undesired possible consequences of overexposure to television in the most bizarre and shocking way possible. Cronenberg is of the opinion that television like all other inventions made to improve quality of life, can be used by people for evil means by manipulating and influencing the viewers and shaping their opinions and ideals in the precise way that the T.V. stations and their producers want. Videodrome in the film is a show that is all about showing explicit violence and sexual abuse in the most disturbing and unsettling manner. Once a viewer starts watching this, he/she becomes addicted to it and starts having hallucinations. The whole concept of the real world and the world portrayed on television dissolving into one and the same as depicted in the film is a theme which has not lost any of its relevance even today. The popularity of the internet and reality television has for me made 'Videodrome' barring the exaggerations in the film, very prophetic. Human beings today have become genuinely addicted to cheap entertainment which sometimes can be revoltingly demeaning. This might sound a bit too preachy, but the fact is the general mass has become incapable of going deep into a subject matter and having intellectually stimulating conversations. Their sensibilities are molded by reality TV and the politically biased news channels whose producers heavily influence the views held by the public. There is also that fine line of dilemma in the minds of the viewers regarding whether everything that is happening on screen right till the end of the movie is really taking place,or are they the result of Max's(the main character) hallucinations. The film in a very Cronenberg-esque way has a lot of visual surrealism. Most of the themes and messages conveyed in the film is through at times bizarre and at times beautiful imagery instead of dialogues. Even in 2015, most of the practical effects in the film hold up and are still capable of shocking viewers. The only problem I have with the film is that I thought Max's hallucinations started a little too abruptly and Cronenberg could have taken a bit of time to build them up gradually. Having said that, it is a minor reservation.James Woods nails the character of Max Renn. Woods perfectly portrays the transition of the character of Max from being a confident, suave and insensitively business-minded T.V. executive to a helpless person who becomes addicted to Videodrome and whose life completely falls apart with the subsequent hallucinations. Debbie Harry does a good job of portraying the role of Nicki which is a very interesting and wild character. Leslie Carlson as Barry Convex also impressed me very much.In conclusion, 'Videodrome' is a film which is not for everyone. Some people might get annoyed by the explicit nature of the violence and body horror in the film, but if you have the stomach for those things, it can be a film that you can admire both for its horror elements as well as its sci-fi elements with themes which are profound and still relevant.",Videodrome
96,malkane316,Que?,8,2 May 2004,"Quick Reviews. Almost incomprehensible, especially to those new to Cronenberg, Videodrome makes my 150 list ahead of Scanners because of the barrage of originality, and visually memorable images: The living TV, the video cassette chest etc. James Woods is perfect in his role, showing confusion and enthusiasm in equal amounts, and the rest of the cast are adequate. The themes ranging from entertainment, sexuality, and politics reflected within society create endless discussion, and necessitate many viewings. Fear of our relationship with modern technology has rarely been shown so effectively. Plus it has Debbie Harry naked.Out of all of Cronenberg's this is the one i most frequently come back to. after The Fly. 8 out of 10.",Videodrome
97,charchuk,A hallucinatory experience,10,17 December 2007,"I don't think I understand any of what the film was going for, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't affect me. The visuals are frightening and powerful and oh so cool, and really make the film. I really dug that you couldn't, at any one time, decide what was real and what was a hallucination. And it runs throughout the entire film, there's no third act twist where everything is revealed to be a dream. Though its bleak and somewhat unsatisfactory ending made the logical side of me cringe, the artistic side of me loved the brash social commentary that it was going for (at least, I think that's what it was). I'd watch this film again just for the visuals.",Videodrome

99,buckikris,Watching Videodrome Is Hazardous To Ones Mental Health,7,10 January 2015,"I just watched this movie yesterday, and thought it's good; but VERY BIZARRE. Even though Videodrome isn't one of my favorite Cronenberg films, it's still worth a look. My favorites of his are a tie between Scanners/Eastern Promises. Videodrome is a movie about a sleazy cable producer, Max Renn(James Woods). He works for Civic T.V., and is looking for the next big hit, regardless of the consequences. The movie begins with Max looking for any kind of smut that will bring in huge ratings. One day he and Harlan; who has work for Renn for two years, hack into this show called Videodrome. Max watches it, but Harlan doesn't, Max wonder's if this s##t is for real. Videodrome includes S&M, bondage, murder, NUTHING BUT SMUT. Once he watches it he believes this is the huge hit he is looking for. One night Nicki his girlfriend( Deborah Harry), tells Max she is going to Pittsburg to audition for the show. Max is so intrigued with Videodrome even though one of his colleagues, Marcia, tells him it's dangerous. He tracks down Bianca O'Blivion( Sonja Smits), because her father is suppose to know more about Videodrome. She sends him a videotape (Videodrome)and he watches it.He noticesBrian Oblivion( Jack Creley), and Brian explains what Videodrome is. Max has already saw some of Videodrome before,so he is experiencing hallucinations. Brian explains to Max what Videodrome is, and what it had done to him. After the video is over Max really starts to experience hallucinations. He is wondering what is causing them, and why? When he goes back to see Bianca O'Blivion, she explains that Videodrome killed her father. He was Videodrome's 1ST victims, he watched it, and developed a tumor. This is where it gets weird, Videodrome implants a tumor in the viewer when they watch it. By this point Max Renn is having severe hallucinations; and is losing his grip on reality. One night he meets Barry Convex(Les Carlson), and Barry explains more about Videodrome. As soon as we meet Barry we have a feeling he is just as sleazy as Max. Max gets a demo of Videodrome, and sees his girlfriend in the sample they give him. The next thing he knows he's home in his bed, and a body is in there with him. It actually looks like one of his colleagues, Marcia. He is freaking out now, he calls Harlan and tells him to get his A$$ over to his place ASAP. He tells him to bring his camera for pictures. Once Harlan arrives Max tells him to take pictures of his bed. Harlan says why, there's nothing there. Max looks again , and Harlan is right nothing is there. Max is like WTF and decides goes back to see Convex. When Max arrives he begins to put the puzzle together. He realizes Harlan is a mole, he actually works for Convex. Convex is a huge SLEAZ, more than Max is. Convex puts a video tape into MAX, his receiver I guess; and now Max is under their mind control. They tell him to go and kill Bianca O'blivion, because she is a threat. He goes to her apartment, and knows why he is there. She knows all about it; and she gets to him first by removing Convex's tape. She implants one of her tapes in his receiver. It's a weird opening in his stomach that looks like a mouth. She explains to Max what really happened to his girlfriend, they killed her and used her image to seduce him. She says "" IT'S TIME TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL"" and gives him new instruction's on destroying Videodrome and it's creators. Renn does get Harlan back for backstabbing him, and yes it's quite a scene. Then when he goes to the convention, and kills Convex it gets ridiculous. Convex's final scene is stupid and laughable. By this point in the movie, I disappointed with the ending. I liked this film, but the last scene with Convex, and the ending was disappointing. The ending was rushed, and it was a shame for a Cronenberg film. I believe I would have given this film an 10 instead of a 7, if it weren't for some of the stupidity; and the rushed ending.THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Videodrome
100,tankace,"Don't watch it if you are crazy with conspiracy theories, it is going to hurt.",8,29 January 2017,"Videodrome was made more than three decades ago and dispute the setting of cable TV being nowadays outdated ,the idea it isn't. Far from it, it actually quit prophetic about the evolution of mass entertainment.In the story we follow a sleazy TV programmer, who's programs are of questionable quality to be polite and he tries to find the next best thing in order to get more audience. And the he finds out Videodrome, a show like no other, with an extremely violent imagery. But during his watch he starts to have some disturbing visions and at times it is hard to understand if watch he saw was real or not. In general David Cronenberg is master on making something unsettling feel close to the watcher as if he is facing them and Videodrome is no exception.To the prophetic , the main theme of the movie is how over-exposure in violence can cause significant mental and psychical damage to the brain and body. Now the idea that watch violence in movies and television will make cruel yourself, it is wrong for nowadays we have dozens of violent TV shows and the global crime rate is lower than when Videodrome came out, but I won't disagree with that watching mindless slaughter in your free time it isn't the best way to have a good time. For instance in Game of Thrones a lot of horrible events take place, but the reason they are so painful is that we care about the characters in it, while in Passion of Christ we only see Jesus becoming out of the blue a bloody pulp ( I don't make any religious remark I judge the film as it is) so yes horrific but why?And that is I think what Cronenberg try to warn us. Also if you are bit conspiracy crazy with that film you will either have a blast or go nuts. If you want to watch it do it at your own digression, for it has also scenes for which Cronenberg is famous for.All in all it is a really interesting film and a must watch for anyone with strong opinion about the way violence is presented to the audience, I hypothesis you will find a lot of meat in that flick.",Videodrome
101,culwin,"""Network"" + ""Brazil"" + ""Clockwork Orange"" = ""Videodrome""?",8,10 January 1999,"Wow!  My favorite actor and my favorite singer in the same movie!  Deborah Harry (of Blondie fame) gives a great non-blonde performance as an ""emotionally energized"" radio show host, and James Woods is a scummy business-minded owner of a seedy TV station.Like ""Brazil"" or ""Twelve Monkeys"" this movie will make you think, and even though there isn't really much violence or horror, your mind will fill in the parts that aren't there.  The ability of a movie to do this makes it a must-see alone.  You constantly ask yourself ""is this real?"" just as the main character is asking the same thing.One thing about this movie is that they never really answer a lot of things. As we watch the main character go in and out of reality, the audience is never quite sure what is really happening either.  They never tell us.  They never truly explain who is behind Videodrome, or even what happens to James Woods.  If you didn't like the ending of Network or Twelve Monkeys, then you won't like the lack of explanation here either.Lots of underlying messages here too, involving television, pornography, and technology - all of which are more significant today than in 1983.  Note common themes such as the head in a box.  Excellently made film, the only thing that would have made it better is more story.",Videodrome
102,PeterRoeder,Simply stunning,9,1 April 2004,"This movie is nothing less than an amazing adventure - like a trip to an unknown place of the earth. I will not go into the details of the excellent characters (especially the male and female lead characters are good). However, I just want to say that Cronenberg sets out to solve the mystery of life and death - and in a way - he solves it! Therefore this movie is an absolute must-see for truth-seeking children and teenagers - it will provide the most astonishing carthasis and epiphany. The ending is nothing less than amazing, almost like the ending to Planet of the Apes. The symmetry and use of repetitive motifs are quite awesome. The story of Videodrome is also quite brilliant, although one should watch the movie at least 10 times before getting a grip of it. The best movie Cronenberg has made. His ouvre, where I have seen all, is not always perfect - but it is always rewarding. Please, please, please watch and love this powerful entry in the field of horror-sci-fi!",Videodrome

105,TheRedDeath30,Still Not a Cronenberg Fan,6,27 July 2015,"I am sure this will be one of those reviews that garners me plenty of ""not helpful"" votes because it seems on this site that any opinion that differs from someone else usually tends to count as ""not helpful"". So be it. I am a lifelong horror junkie and have seen all of the classics and more obscure indie horror than you can imagine. Seems to be a prerequisite of being a horror junkie that there are certain directors you are almost required to worship without question. One of those is always Cronenberg, who's works show up on most lists of ""best horror movies"".I have found that I do not enjoy his movies nearly as many as some other horror fans. I tend to find my brain glazing over as most of his movies seem to lean much closer to sci-fi territory, often involving vast conspiracies and shadowy government organizations. There often tends to be a whole lot of dialog and exposition, most of it wordy and chock full of invented terms that typically would have no connotation outside of the movie. It's not, I would hope, that his films are ""too intelligent"" for me. I love a thinking man's horror film. It's just that I found myself losing interest in the complicated plots and techy mumbo jumbo that so often accompany the movies of this director.(SIDENOTE: His version of THE FLY is one of my absolute favorites. I like RABID and THE BROOD far more than most, but am no fan of SCANNERS or THE DEAD ZONE)So, all of that is a long-winded way of saying that I've been putting this one off for a long time. I have seen every other movie from Cronenberg's ""classic period"" and as much good press as this movie usually gets, I was hesitant. I really did try to go into this with an open mind. It definitely starts off feeling different than some of his work, with a TV producer looking for something exploitative that will give him a edge. He stumbles upon Videodrome and realizes far too late that sometimes things seen can never be unseen and will have consequences. From there, the movie starts to detour into something much more akin to Cronenberg's typical ""body horror"" style, as James Woods' character starts to question reality.Most horror fans will be familiar with most of the best scenes in this movie prior to viewing, as they've been showing in infinity on programs like Bravo's Scariest Movie Moments series. There are certainly some great visual ideas here and the viewer, like the characters, is sometimes left to wonder what's real, as well. I like James Woods and think he does a great job with the role in this movie. There are so many ingredients to this movie that I should like it, so why did I find myself so bored by it? Look, I'm not a film critic. If I was I'd have my own site and wouldn't be writing reviews here. There are plenty of pretentious writers on here that will tell you they love every classic, whether they've seen it or not. I feel like my job is to be honest and my opinion is that this movie will be a snoozer for quite a few of you also.",Videodrome

I'm sure it's a porn category somewhere in the deepest, darkest depths of the internet.But if you're not, and are willing to have your thoughts on porn, how entertainment affects our minds, and how technology has only gotten more inescapable since this film's release challenged a bit, then I have even better news for you. Cause even though I don't think I'll know exactly what this film is trying to say on a political or philosophical level until I watch it again, I can tell you for sure it is saying something really interesting.It might actually be one of the most thematically deep horror films I've ever seen, and somehow it does that in less than 90 minutes, while also being a damn creepy and gross body horror for anyone who just wants nothing more than to be scared. And like I said, even though I don't know what exactly it's saying or even if I agree with it, it still has to be one of the most interesting technological/sexual horrors ever made.So in short, this film's story is fascinating to me, and I could easily see this being bumped up a point on a rewatch when I have a bit more time to think about it.I could also see it being bumped up another point to a perfect score if only some of the cinematography was just a little bit more creative. There's a few interesting shots here and there, but mostly this film's memorable visuals come from its disgusting and flawless (for the time anyway) body horror effects, and my god are they amazing. I'd almost put it on the same level as The Thing for practical effects.All the performances are bloody brilliant too, but especially James Woods, who is a total sleazebag, and yet not really one that you want to get killed - if only so you can keep seeing the bonkers stuff he gets himself into.And as if all this wasn't good enough, I feel as though this film has a really timeless quality, especially considering how any sort of ""adult entertainment"" you could imagine is even more available then it was to anyone back in 1983.I feel like I could quite easily write a whole bloody essay on this film, but I'll leave it at that and tell you to just go watch it already, especially if you want some Halloween horror that isn't the usual cheesy slasher stuff we all gorge ourselves on around this time of year.",Videodrome
109,Aly200,"Bizarre, Engrossing and Mind-bending",9,25 June 2016,"Of all David Cronenberg's films, ""Videodrome"" would have to be his relevant. The concept of how television or the media in general controls what we see or what we perceive of subject matter is a disturbing truth. The film is in a sense like George Orwell's ""1984"" but as imagined by the master of body horror cinema, David Cronenberg.The premise of ""Videodrome"" revolves around TV executive Max Renn (an immensely unsettling performance by the excellent James Woods) and his obsession with the titular station takes the viewer down a dark rabbit hole of hallucinations, perverse interests, a society that feeds off sex and violence and gross-out moments galore. Lending a feminine touch of perversity to the film in her break-out acting role is ""Blondie"" singer Deborah Harry as the sadomasochistic Nicki Brand who helps kick-start Max's ultimate downfall into an even more amoral shell of a man.The film heavily relies on the powerhouse performance of James Woods as the morally corrupt Max Renn. Woods pulls out all the stops for the role as he goes from a charming, but despicable smut peddler for his television station to an instrument of destruction not only for himself, but for humanity around him though Max is unaware as his mind deteriorates due to ""Videodrome""'s power. James Woods never loses his charm even as Max descends into his delusions even further, but the viewer can tell it won't end well for Max as his mind is susceptible to any form of influence around him.The other key to the film's enduring legacy and intrigue are its terrifying scenes of Max Renn's delusions and the genius effects created by Oscar winning makeup artist, Rick Baker. Baker's arguable masterpiece in ""Videodrome"" would be the film's infamous cassette slit in Max Renn's abdomen which is first seen halfway into the film. I myself found myself squirming uncomfortably in my seat, clutching my stomach watching James Woods as Max stick his hand into the slit (which was made in a prosthetic torso placed in front of actor James Woods who was glued to the sofa). The film's other memorable squirming scene is Max's hallucination of Nicki on his television and his head melds to the television or the scene near the close of the film is unsettling.If you want a thought-provoking body horror, give ""Videodrome"" a try but be warned that it is not for the faint of heart.",Videodrome
110,ryan-10075,"""Death to Videodrome! Long live the new flesh!""",9,5 June 2019,"In my opinion this is David Cronenberg's greatest film I have ever seen. I have been watching horror films ever since I was probably too young to watch most of them and I had seen quite a bit of Cronenberg (THE FLY, THE DEAD ZONE, RABID) before I came across this film. I was really wanting to see it, because it looked so weird. When I did see it if aliens came knocking on my door it wouldn't have pulled me away from the TV screen. After watching this I re-watched all of the Cronenberg films I had seen over the last few years and some I actually enjoy even more. Seems I got to the Cronenberg fan camp a little later in life. I am glad I did not see this one as a youngster as it probably would have scared the daylights out of me. This film is not for all tastes due to the gore and sex.James Woods is terrific as a sleazeball cable-TV programmer out of Toronto. He is looking for the next big thing to put on his station. But, he is looking for violence and sex. Two major ingredients he is looking for. Then he comes across a zero budget looking show called Videodrome and like a drug he is hooked on it. He wants to put it on his station so he tries to find out about this show. That is when things start to get strange.Rick Baker also did the effects on some weird and incredible things that were coming from the mind of David Cronenberg.Things that I love about this film are that while completely planted in 1983 with the televisions, satellites and Atari games that put you there it still has an enormous ring in today's world. A door is also opened by Cronenberg where he attempts to show no boundaries or the viewer having a tough time distinguishing between reality and someone's hallucination.Also starring Blondie lead singer Debbie Harry as Woods' new love interest Nicki Brand.If this does sound interesting I would suggest running out a finding this film now.

Good performances from James Woods, Deborah Harry and Sonja Smits. Wonderfully queasy special effects. But when a film begins as strongly as does ""Videodrome"", it's hard to watch it turn into an opaque stew. David Cronenberg poses a vital question (what happens when violence begins to turn people on sexually?) only to leave it unanswered and, while ambiguous endings *can* work in horror and sci-fi, they're best suited to subject matter that's esoteric to begin with. ""Videodrome"" is just the opposite: the movie addresses such a legitimate real-world issue that it practically screams for a more coherent ending than the one it's got. Cronenberg takes you on an entertaining ride, yes, but don't expect it to make sense. (I found ""Shivers"" and ""Rabid"" more satisfying.) Six and a half stars.",Videodrome

The movie tends to surprise us with its visuals too when we're least expecting it which makes its scenes work even better.This also has great acting from James Woods. All of the other actors were great too but James Woods was really the only one who I felt stood out in the movie. However, his great performance was enough to carry the movie.This movie has a chilling message which becomes more powerful today seeing as how technology keeps on advancing which leads to explicit and graphic entertainment rise.This is still a great movie but I feel that The Fly is a better movie than this. The reason I think so is because The Fly contained well-written characters. I couldn't really connect with Max Renn as I did with Seth Brundle. However, this shouldn't bother you too much if you don't mind lack of character development. However, this is why I feel that The Fly is a little better.In conclusion, this is a disturbing movie which contains a deep message. It gives audiences some disturbing things to think about. This is an amazing movie and all. I just think that The Fly is better because of its character development. However, you should still see this one too.",Videodrome
114,Christopher_Reid,"A strange, gory, dream-like and thought-provoking movie",9,15 January 2015,"It's interesting to wonder to what degree our lives are influenced by television, the internet, pornography, music, books. Certainly some forms of media seem less invasive, more passive, whereas others are almost impossible to avoid and appear to be taking over our lives. They not only contain messages and ideas that might affect our way of thinking (possibly without us knowing) but they can also become addictive. They can distract us from our real life or inspire us to change, for better or worse. It's sometimes hard to tell whether you're actually addicted to something or if you simply enjoy it a lot or are passionate about it.Videodrome explores the limits of how television in particular (although it could represent any and all forms of media) can invade our lives. It mixes interesting ideas about the mind, sexual desires, voyeurism, sadomasochism, hypocrisy. The acting isn't amazing unless you compare it to most horror movies in which case it is. We follow Max Renn (James Woods, who voiced Hades in Hercules) closely throughout the movie. Cronenberg commented that he sees and knows everything we do, which is uncommon and makes the movie more intimate.Max begins to have hallucinations and it gradually becomes ambiguous what's real and what isn't, although there are often clues. It isn't clear how much control he has over his actions, he seems to be under a trance at times, pulled by an unquenchable curiosity or simply bored with nothing else to do. Much like a couch potato, staring at a screen. We get so bored with our comfortable lives that we need to watch disturbing or extreme things to be entertained. Or we're so lazy that even the most trite material can hold our attention for hours.The gory parts of Videodrome are like manifestations of what desire and paranoia can do to us. An grotesque vision of what can happen inside the mind as a person loses themselves to an obsession or addiction. The special effects are really well done. Clearly they are very symbolic and a lot of interesting interpretations could be put into them. There is a kind of organic gun similar to the one in eXistenZ.Videodrome was mysterious and mesmerising all the way through. It's a horror thriller that is satisfying weird and unsettling without being too gross or pretentious or confusing. It's more about the journey than any end result. The interesting part is why do we go down these bunny-holes? Why do we sit through a whole movie wanting to see what happens to this fictional character? Some of the TV shows I see my parents watching have rape, terrorism, revenge, betrayal, sex and casual laughs in between. It's all standard these days. I definitely think Videodrome was ahead of its time as its themes feel very relevant in 2015.",Videodrome

Visually, Videodrome is a masterpiece with some of the best special effects of its time and a few excellent performances.James Woods plays Max Wrenn, a man who runs an adult TV station. Adult meaning anything from porn to hardcore violence. He decides he is unsatisfied with what's being aired on his station and decides he wants something harder, more vicious and disturbing. This is when he stumbles across a rare snuff film only known as Videodrome. This is where the movie gets weird as Videodrome tends to cause hallucinations in its viewers and is able to control people and even mutate repeat viewers.This film is a masterpiece that really will blow your mind leaving you sitting through the credits at the end of the movie. The storyline is genuinely original and very thought provoking, as with most of Cronenberg's work. I haven't a bad thing to say about this movie other than the movie is to short. Even the director's cut only runs about 89 minutes. Other than that this is a great movie. 10/10 stars",Videodrome
116,TCurtis9192,"""VIDEODROME""",7,10 May 2020,"Don't watch ""VIDEODROME"" (1983, Cronenburg) expecting a coherent story or message. To do so will leave you cold. It is an arthouse picture, presenting opposing ideas (such as how violence and sexuality in the media should be viewed), hints at things never explained (Oblivion's philosophy and that of VIDEODROME itself), and perhaps a fraction of a much larger storyline never seen.Cronenburg didn't make this film as a statement on anything (although I suspect there was an element of attacking prudish puritans, especially seeing as he has famously been targeted by people like that for his grotesque works) but rather was inspired by events of his youth (pirating TV signals and wondering""what if"" he came across something lurid and not meant for public consumption) and, I would guess, wrote a ""what if"" story from that.If that's the case then whatever you think it's about is most probably wrong and to enjoy the film take it for what it is. A surreal fever dream conceived in the real world and born in fantasy.",Videodrome
117,KoolCatReviews,Freaky repulsive but absolutely absorbing,8,21 May 2020,"This is one of my top picks for a classic cult 80s horror. It's got great special effects and erratic story and very fitting acting. Every scene bring to life its unusual style. This movie won't be for everyone but most will appraise it. The concept of the plot is simple enough to begin with however it gets really choatic and crazy, however this isn't detrimental to the move as a whole. When you ride the choas and violence of videodrome you'll be in for one heck of thrill.",Videodrome
118,Jakealope,"Great Concept, but Degenerates Into Stupidity & Gory Effects",5,2 April 2011,"It had a great concept, a sleazy cable channel operator, Max Renn, always on the prowl for more sleaze, finds this mysterious cable channel full of pointless sex and violence, which turns him and his degenerate girlfriend on. Then throw in some Marshall MacLuhan professor type who communicates to the world via video cassettes and runs a mission where society's outcasts are rehabilitated by letting them watch TV in their own cubicles. There is lots of messaging about bad media addictions and a polluted TV culture, But this Videodrome pirate channel is more than just a new low of non-stop sex and violence, it reprograms the TV addict's body to do things like grow a VCR tape slot in the stomach and have wild violent hallucinations. Here is where it gets the Cronenberg gore special efx touch which eventually undoes the movie.In one scene, after the changed Max fights back against the Videodrome people with the help of the professor's daughter, his old technical wizard attempts to reprogram him by sticking a new pulsating lifelike VCR tape in his stomach slot. Just like the Thing, his hand goes into Max's stomach but instead of Max's whatever is inside him just chomping the tech's hand off, it turns the tech's hand into some sort of grenade that causes the tech to explode, blowing a few precut cinder blocks loose. Then Max goes on some more gory revenge scenes and it ends up really dumb in the end.So Cronenberg takes a good concept and theme and essentially does little better than what his fictitious cable channel did, feed us some gore and R light sex under the guise of exploring the dark side of the media. This is why I never regarding the director as anything more than a clever shock jock with little artistic or social vision. But in Canada, he is still a hero, small country I guess.",Videodrome

120,jay4stein79-1,I just can't cope with the freaky stuff.,10,13 November 2004,"Well, Mr. Convex, too bad for you... Videodrome, David Cronenberg's first masterpiece, tells the tale of one Max Renn. Played with expert sleaziness by James Woods, Renn oversees a low-rent, exploitative cable network, which specializes in showing increasingly violent and pornographic shows. When he stumbles upon the satellite transmission of ""Videodrome"" - a realistic S&M/Torture show from Pittsburgh - Renn believes that he's discovered the next wave. Then come the hallucinations... maybe dead bodies, cancer guns, stomach-vulvas, etc. Reality bends and, perhaps, Videodrome has taken over...In every respect, Videodrome is a great film, managing to repulse and intrigue simultaneously. It is horrific and contains numerous science-fiction motifs, but, unlike the horror and special effects driven pictures of today, Videodrome, to quote the film, has a philosophy. Videodrome is not about mind-controlling cable shows; it is about our un-healthy consumption of visual media. I may not agree with Cronenberg's vision of our relationship with TV, but it is never less than interesting. It's refreshing to see a movie about more than itself; it seems that, since the 1980s, these types of films have become increasingly rare and that's a shame. Maybe it's only nostalgia, but the era when films like Videodrome and Dawn of the Dead were being made by major studios and released to huge audiences seems like a Golden Age to my mind.Here's to hoping those days will return. What's truly brilliant about Videodrome, beyond its decision to base itself upon an idea, is its seamless blending of the characters' realities and their hallucinations. After the forty-five minute mark, what actually happens becomes lost as we enter deeper and deeper in the the tortured psyche of Max Renn. It is impossible, by the end of the movie, to know what actually happened. Unlike a movie like Donnie Darko, which left me puzzled and irritable, I accept the puzzlement of Videodrome because an explanation would have lessened the film's visceral impact. The open-endedness of the narrative melds perfectly with a film that revels in the hallucination/reality divide. If the characters cannot comprehend what is actually happening, why should we?As mentioned, every element of this film works. There are amazing set-pieces (throbbing televisions and gurgling video cassettes) and moments of beautiful photography (the shots of Renn approaching the harbor for instance). The acting, even by Debbie Harry in her first starring role, is excellent. James Woods, in particular, excels. He has always been one of my favorite actors and brings to Renn a level of sleaziness that perhaps could have been achieved by only him or Harry Dean Stanton. This is Cronenberg's first masterpiece (sorry, I'm not too keen on his earlier work, as it doesn't meld his ideas and venereal/technological horror as well) and started a string of absolutely brilliant films. For me, it's also his greatest masterpiece; it's (forgive me for using this word) postmodern vision is spell-binding and the story is, I think, his most imaginative to date. As his career went forward, Cronenberg became more and more respectable and, I think, that hurt his work slightly. In Videodrome, he is at the top of his form and working with his most amazing cast. The movie is an acquired taste and will not appeal to everyone, but I highly recommend it and think you should all watch it with an open mind.",Videodrome
121,RIK-22,Depth and style in a twisted world,9,28 November 2001,"This film is a personal favourite.Another great, from Cronenberg.  Cronenberg is certainly not to everyone's taste, but you can't help but admire that even with the most obscure and difficult subjects he can create a style and atmosphere which makes the viewer forget any plot implausibility.Videodrome is the tale of a gun-ho TV producer wanting to push the envelope even further to please the ever-lustful public.  As a result the producer becomes more and more drawn into the shocking world of Videodrome.  As the film progresses, the main character and the audience gets more and more mixed up into what reality and what's not.  Is it real or is it video. Various fractions and parties try to control and influence the Videodrome, but who is really in control, anyone?Cronenberg has the ability to add a wonderful depth and atmosphere, to an unusual film and this is what really makes the experience worthwhile.  This isn't a gore flick, yet it has gore, it's about feeling and passion, even though the subject matter is far from common.Others have criticised it, but I loved the ending and the great crescendo of ultimate despair, to really become the 'New flesh', you have to escape the old.The theme of the new flesh pops up throughout Cronenbergs movies, I have yet to really grasp it, but I will continue to try.  Much better than Existenz, which, for me, was a disappointment by comparison.  Videodrome is great, probably not appreciated by most, but loved by me.",Videodrome

But he gets more than he bargained for when he stumbles across videodrome: a fuzzy satellite feed of murder and torture which induces violent hallucinations in those exposed to its images.Cronenberg's mind is a thing of beauty as much as it is a place of madness. And 'Videodrome' represents some of his strongest work, and certainly one of his best scripts.Sex, violence, and gore is the norm in a Cronenberg feature, and this is no different. We are voyeurs, ensnared in a disturbing story that gives us a peek behind a curtain into a dark, perverted corner of the world revolving around sensationalism and unhealthy public consumption. The effects of violent television imagery is explored to grim depths, and it's sickeningly inviting, difficult to turn away or shut off your gaze.Overall, thanks to James Woods' strong lead performance, Howard Shore's dark soundtrack, and Cronenberg's typical flair for the grotesque and thought-provoking, this is a nasty piece of work - and I love it.",Videodrome

124,toqtaqiya2,Perhaps the best articulated vision of Cronenberg's ongoing exploration of the edges of technology and human physiology.,8,21 September 2010,"Videodrome is David Cronenberg's masterpiece and his most influential film. His films before Videodrome attracted a cult following but it was this film that made Hollywood notice the visionary Canadian director. All his films are meditations on sex and death. James Woods playing the part of Max Renn is very memorable here. He comes across a sinister mysterious TV programme called Videodrome. After that the film plays very much like a detective thriller as Max tries to find out more about it. Most of all, however, it's a science-fiction horror film about the influence on human beings of violence on TV. The themes here gain even more weight in today's computerized society. Violence and pornography such as shown in Videodrome are more and more accessible. Max's sexual involvement with a talk-radio celebrity (punk-rock singer Deborah Harry) who takes pleasure in pain also strikes a chord. The film marked the end of Cronenberg's splatter-shock period. The Fly, produced four years later by 20th Century Fox, is as close as he has come to making a blockbuster.",Videodrome
125,schroederagustavo,Surreal,8,13 July 2021,"There's a lot of good things to be said about Videodrome: How original it is, how much you can tell Cronenberg is making the film he wants to make and doesn't hold back at all. The body horror aspect of the film is legendary, James Wood is great in the film, there's interesting social commentary on the influence of television and how violence and sexuality depicted in TV affect us. I enjoyed how weird it is and that's part of the originality of the film, I've never really seen a film like quite like this. And there comes a point in the movie where things start to get out of control and it comes almost without a warning, so it's actually pretty shocking when it does happen. I think the movie does go a little too overboard for my taste in the surreal aspects of it in the sense that after a certain point in the movie, which happens to be rather early on, the line between what is real and what is hallucination is not only blurry, but disappears completely. And that can be a good thing, but since it happens so early in the movie and it just keeps going until the film is over, it's a little too confusing and abstract for my personal taste.However, I will say that it's very much worth watching, i think it is a very good movie, thoroughly orignal, very well directed, the score by Howard Shore fits the movie perfectly and adds to the tension, James Wood is great and the body horror stuff is amazing.",Videodrome

So I wouldn't advice it for you who don't like that sort of things. Especially since this movie surround around porn, snuff films, and weird changes to the flesh, which also make's it a bit of a gory movie. It's obvious sci-fi theme makes it mild in my opinion, but it might scare some of you.For a good performance by James Woods, and a good thrilling atmosphere and intelligent story, I give Videodrome an 8/10.",Videodrome
127,wandereramor,Long live the new flesh,10,15 September 2012,"Videodrome is one of those movies that seems to create its own reality around it -- not just a world, but a way of looking at the world. Cronenberg patches together this setting out of a host of low-culture sources, from sleazy cable soft-porn to B-movie horror to dirty realism, also spliced through a postmodern and self-reflexive filter.It's almost hard to know where to start with the film's content, let alone its themes. Videodrome is most obviously about the media industry's constant hunger for the extreme, the desire for envelope-pushing that is always chasing the product that's just a little more violent or titillating than the previously-established limit. Cronenberg basically understands, and in the film deconstructs, the pleasure we get from this type of fare. But he portrays it as ultimately addictive and cancerous. This is perhaps even more relevant today, in the age of reality TV, viral videos, and gonzo porn than it was in 1983.At the same time, though, Videodrome embodies the best of the B-movie: it has sex, violence, and most of all strangeness. You're never sure what's going to happen minute to minute, but it's never dull. Videodrome is, then, simultaneously a condemnation of exploitative B-movie culture and one of the greatest examples of it. But it's also so much more than that -- the final act suggests that to oppose this kind of culture is to also fall into it.I can't really do this film justice in a review of this size, at least in part because I haven't fully wrapped my head around it, but Videodrome is definitely a masterpiece. It might be Cronenberg's best film, and even if not, it feels like the codex to his ouevre -- his purest statement on our simultaneous attraction and repulsion to the body and cinema.",Videodrome
128,anthonyf94,"Old flesh, new flesh",8,16 October 2019,"""Videodrome"" isn't nothing different from the problematical mix between material world with its decadence (the body), immaterial world with its allucinations (the mind) and media world that's a kind of intermediate between the other poles, because it's at the same time material (VHS, TV etc) and immaterial (the fictional world beyond the screen).Max has to deal with his problem, that's revealed by a strong surrealistic Cronenberg in all its fleshy power and carnal violence. Thought also as a replication against critics about his violent movies, Cronenberg use this story to investigate which is the point of separation between the three points before mentioned. So the main characters, a TV producer that sells violent and hard movies, find itself inside a conspiracy that involves government and TV systems, but that reverses all its cruelty on him: after the vision of ""Videodrome"", he starts to have allucinations, that are for him really realistic (as the opening of his stomach or the fusion between the gun and his hands), and from that moments all scenes are lived from Max and from the spectator as something difficult to understand if it's reality or dream.The solution of this strange connection between flesh and technology couldn't be different from a suicide: in the hail of new flesh is contained all the philosophy of this movie, that showed creepy aspects of transhumanism and all the criticisms on mass media society, not just as something totally wrong, but as something deep that have to be studied better.Surrealistic violence and visionary effects, unified with interesting reflections about mass media powers and organic difference (and interference) between body, mind and technology.",Videodrome
129,MattBirk,A Movie that Perfectly Describes Todays TV Obsession,8,10 April 2015,"What can be said that hasn't already been said about Videodrome, it's flat out weird! From the bizarre body horror imagery that Cronenberg is known for, to the ingenious messages he tries to establish. Though the visuals are spectacular (in a cheesy way), the brilliance of the film are the ideas/themes that Cronenberg wanted to get across that seem to make more sense nowadays than they probably did in in the early 80s. Those ideas being of course people living their lives through the front of a screen and having the programming become our reality. How could you even argue this idea now that we have cellphones, tablets, laptops, etc? This overall idea to me is genius, especially now that those ideas have had time to develop. Specifically the idea that TV has now become more racy and violent than ever before, it's just as the movie predicted. People becoming obsessed with the most violent content they can find and becoming infatuated with it (I'm looking at you, The Walking Dead). Cronenberg had the right ideas and the only thing left was to display them in the right fashion, and his notorious body horror genre was the right way to go. The imagery here really cements the ideas and shows just how contorted and scary the ideas within the movie can be.However one of the few things I didn't like about Videodrome is the origin of Videodrome itself, it felt too similar to too many other ideas out there about it being a conspiracy. The vessel (TV) may be different, but the person driving the ship for that particular reason is the same (weird analogy I know). Had the movie kept the origin of the actual broadcast a secret or chose a different path, I think the movie would have been a bit more interesting or thought provoking (as if it already isn't).But outside of that, the overall message of Videodrome is pretty damn great, though it does get more head scratching as the movie progresses. But it's hard to argue with the bigger philosophies of Videodrome, they're through provoking, intriguing, and displayed in such a surreal manner that it makes the ideas hit home so much harder. Videodrome is a classic for a reason!",Videodrome
130,ebert_jr,Powerfully surreal Cronenberg story.,10,25 January 2001,"Looking back, Videodrome was right on target with its social commentary on tv blurring the distinction between reality and fantasy.  Today, almost twenty years after this film was made, we can tap in to moral and ethical decay, served up by television 24x7.  ""Reality"" based television is all the rage.  We see telvision reflecting reality reflecting telvision. 
People who rag on this film, for it's sometimes wooden performances, or the sometimes cheezy eery music sounds, etc, are missing the point of the film.

Accidentally he discovers Videodrome.  First, it controlled his mind, then his body.  Finally he doesn't even recognize himself. Beyond the obvious references of how some t.v. shows creates influences on the viewer, this movie does have something that Alejandro Amenabar used for his film Tesis (THESIS, 1996).

134,fathersonholygore,It's all about penetration. A review with some spoilers.,10,3 May 2013,"When Barry Convex tells Max Ren (James Woods) he just wants him to ""open up"", it becomes very clear the message of David Cronenberg's Videodrome: obsessing over media in its variety of forms leads to a deeply disturbing realization that those who fall prey to that obsession are penetrated viscerally. Max is constantly seeking something more raw, something very human in mass media, but what he finds is maybe too human, and too much a part of him. At first, the show Videodrome appears to be fake, and yet seriously realistic: it appears to be snuff, a violent torture before eventual murder. Slowly, Max realizes it's more than just a show, and soon his fascination gives way to terror. However, he eventually becomes just another slave to the media he obsesses over. There are many interpretations of Cronenberg's film. He based the character of Barry O'blivion on Marshall McLuhan who lectured at the University of Toronto while Cronenberg attended, and McLuhan had some interesting views on the philosophy surrounding mass media (he also predicted the internet some 25 or 30 years before it was invented). There are many ways to look at the story. I believe it's more a commentary on the people who pimp media to the masses than on those of us who ingest the media itself, but it could just be a general indictment of the negative effects surrounding mass media. Whatever Cronenberg meant to say with Videodrome, it still comes off in a very intelligent, and disturbing manner. An absolute 10 out of 10 for writing, James Woods and Deborah Harry's performances, and the special effects they were able to pull off for the film. Absolutely incredible.",Videodrome
135,Krug Stillo,Long Live the New Flesh,10,31 May 2003,"Cronenberg is currently recognised as one of the most innovative filmmakers on the planet. Following initially in the footsteps of George Romero, with Shivers (1976) and Rabid (1977), Croneneberg soon moulded a genre of his own using the innate fear of deformity, biological change and sexual imagery. It was during the early eighties, a time when the media believed video films could deprave and corrupt society, Cronenberg made one of his true masterpieces, a film light-years ahead of its time: Videodrome.Max Wren (James Woods in what is arguably his best role) is a television programmer looking for something revolutionary for his pornographic transmissions. One day, an associate discovers a pirate satellite and allows Max to see it, allowing him to enter the perverse world of Videodrome': a new-wave program that causes its viewer to experience disturbing hallucinations. Max soon realises that this is a plan to destroy contemporary society. Actually, it's the words of professor, Brian O' Blivion which become the foundation of all that occurs `You reality is already half video hallucination. If you're not careful, it'll become total hallucination. You'll have to learn to live in a very strange new world. I had a brain tumour and I had visions. I believe the visions caused the tumour and not the reverse. I could feel the vision coalesce and become flesh, uncontrollable flesh. But when they removed the tumour it was called 'VIDEODROME'.This is strong medicine and definitely not for all tastes. Occasionally, to empathise with Max Wren's character, Cronenberg makes telling the difference between what is hallucination and reality difficult. Years later he would give us ExsitenZ (1999) which seemed like Videodome-lite, including his enjoyment of playing with his audiences perception.Conspiracy, institutions and hallucinations, all trademarks of the Canadian genius, the man behind classics such as Scanners (1980), Dead Ringers (1987) and The Brood (1979). The band, Blondie's lead singer, a young and thin Debbie Harry stars opposite Woods as Max's sadomasochistic lover and relishes the thought of being tortured on Videodrome. The other big star of the show is the marvellous special effects provided by the talented Rick Baker: Pulsating televisions, virginal stomach openings, a literal handgun and a gruesome death scene that includes puss spewing from a cracked face. These are the prime ingredients that make Videodomre a truly unique experience.",Videodrome

At some point someone's head explodes and everyone 'loves the flesh'. The radiation from the TV turns Woods into some sort of mutant portable entertainment system, and he can slot videotapes into his tummy for easy consumption (viewing). Later he gets paranoid that the world isn't real and that everything is a TV show and that people are trying to kill him, so he goes on a rampage, shoving guns in his belly, grenades in his wrists, and a sword down his throat. He infiltrates the main TV station building and has to contend with people with antennae protruding from their trouser region, women with satellite dishes for bosoms, overly tanned weather men and propaganda spouting news anchors- literally spouting as all manner of pages, magazines, and books pour forth from their gaping maws whenever opened. He enters a room to find a TV showing him shooting himself. Deciding this is all too much, Woods sits and prepares to shoot himself. He looks up, sees himself entering the room, and pulls the trigger. The new Woods sees this on TV, decides it is too much, then sits and repeats the process.

Would you click the link? Would you not? It's that curiosity about the dark side of humanity that forms the predicate of this entire film, a movie with a protagonist running a television station premised on the broadcasting the most immoral (amoral?) pixels capable of being sold. That portion of the movie - and its general status as a thought piece - I give a 10/10.But, as a film, I struggle to give it more than a 6, even if it's a 6 pushing a 7.
The final quarter of the film simply comes off the rails. Yes, this is the portion of the film where the hipsters come to love the movie and shout its tagline to the less informed: ""Long live the new flesh.""

139,quin1974,"Scary, but loses tension in the end",8,29 January 2001,"The idea of people being brainwashed into drones just by watching television is a very serious and scary idea. Mostly because I watch a lot of TV myself.This is a very Cronenberg movie. The ever-returning theme of humans integrating with machinery is very much presented here by James Woods' character blending in with his hallucinations and becoming the new technology everybody must be afraid of. The gun mutating with his arm is the obvious example of this. This is all done with a lot of gore and slime, and this is regrettably what the movie's undoing is.The acting is very good, James Woods delivers one of his best performances ever. I can not really think of a much better performance from him (maybe Hades in Hercules). Deborah Harry was far better then I expected her to be, her performance gave a very erotic feel to the first two acts, but her character regrettably got lost in the last part. The rest of the cast was fairly unknown to me, but they delivered a good enough effort considering the material they were presenting.In the third act Cronenberg has to wrap this intriguing premise up in a satisfying way and resorts into gore and violence (expertly executed by Rick Baker) and ultimately fails in conveying his message clearly to the audience. He should have kept the gore in the background and the characters in the foreground. The double ending was well thought of by the way.The next thing I was worried about is the dating of the movie. The subject of videotaping and watching TV seems to feel less important now in these days of the information age. Computers have taken over the supremacy from the TV when it comes to information-distribution. The internet is omnipresent. A remake should be made of this movie every twenty or so years to keep it fresh. On the other hand: there is of course Ghost In The Shell (1995) which tells a very similar story, only in reverse. A virtual entity wants to become one with the original technology, that of the human body.When you look at this in total, I think this can not be counted with the better movies made by Cronenberg, such as The Fly (1986) and Crash (1996), but it still deserves an honorable mention for the first two acts.8/10",Videodrome
140,valbrazon,Great concept but disappointing,5,23 April 2012,"I've already seen Scanners and Chromosome 3 from Cronenberg and i didn't like much too. But after have seen Videodrome, i can see the style of this director : disgusting, great special effects and always a story related to the mind or the brain.The concept was great because we follow the story of Max Renn, a cable-TV programmer of a adult channel. With the help of a friend, he acquires a new kind of TV program which gives hallucinations. But the movie goes bad because it's pretty disgusting, for example when Max put his hand in his stomach. I thought ""Tesis"" by Alejandro Amenábar was the remake because Max in ""Videodrome"" is interested in snuff movies program, something real and not acted. Videodrome is not about snuff movies, but hallucinations.A good movie about TV but which turn bad because of his multiple hallucinations and gory scenes.",Videodrome
141,Mr_Mirage,Long live the new flesh,10,24 March 2001,"Far from flawless, somewhat dated, this work still has an effect that is hard to describe. If we watch videos for the thrill, then what happens when the videos watch us? Or become us? Or do we become them?The flaws are many, but it still weighs heavy for me as a must see, simply for the strength of the performance of James Woods. Woods has never seemed so...dare I say...normal.  Deeper and deeper into a nightmare we travel, and the boundary between that which is not real and that which is becomes more and more blurred, until the surreal seems commonplace, and the commonplace is unrecognizable.Long live the new flesh.",Videodrome
142,thao,Glorious poetic and philosophic meditation on reality and technology,10,18 March 2014,"A cable programmer is looking for some rough porn for his local TV station. He stumbles upon a torture porn station called Videodrome and becomes hooked on it. The 80s brought us video cassettes and with it came a chance for teenagers and youths to watch films they had never seen before, films that had age restrictions which prevented them from seeing them at cinema. Sometimes youths could even see films that were banned in their home country. Suddenly the censor board had lost their control and uncensored material flooded the market. Religious groups and moralists were furious and declared a holy war on what came to be called ""Video Nasty"", that would destroy the youths and turn them into morally bankrupt monsters. Cronenberg had had his share of this hysteria. His films had been censored, and some of his films were considered down right dangerous.Cronenberg asked, well, let's say they are right. Let's say technology can change us. How would that look like? Let's make a horror film about that. Let's remember that this is before Internet so the film focuses on TV broadcasting. Still, there are few films that are as prophetic as this one. The Internet runs through this film, with interactive TV, way before that was possible. And if people watched TV too much back in the 80s it really has not gotten any better today. Now we also have the computer screens to watch and our mobile phone screens. Screens and the virtual world has become more part of our life than ever before.And if we were ""basically getting f... by TV"" back in the 80s, as Cronenberg called it, well the F... has not become any more delicate, with the so called Reality TV, which for some is a greater reality than their daily life. Many admit that they realize that it is bad TV, that there is very little of any value there but they just can't stop watching. The some goes for those who watch Videodeome (the torture porn) in this film. We are addicted to trash. And what happens when you work 7 hours in front of a computer screen. You come home, you check your emails, your Facebook, your mobile phone, your TV... What is reality? Is the screen not more real than the grass in front of your door which you hardly ever see?And what affect does this have on us, physically? Neuroscientist say that modern technology is changing the way our brains work. Just Google it. Technology is changing us. We have become a hybrid humans, a mixture of technology and physicality. Technology has even taken over evolution. It is no longer the strongest who decides who lives. Technology extends life way before evolution has a chance to do anything about it. Videodrome came out in 1983, a year before George Orwell's ""1984"" takes place. I remember well back then that people waited for 1984 with anticipation, wondering how much of the book would turnout to be true. Videodrome is strongly influenced by 1984, and it even got one thing right. Unlike the book were big brother is forced upon us, in reality we celebrate big brother and welcome him. We even pay for having him. The Internet, which is connected to our computers, our mobiles, our TVs, and sometimes even our cars, is the eyes of big brother who can follow us, listen to us and watch us with out even asking for our permission. Big brother is here and has been for a while. He can use information he has on us to silence us and destroy us. And we all love him, because each and every one of us are sure that we are on his good side. It is interesting that Cronenberg was and is so hated by morality and religious groups. His horror should be their kind of tea. Instead of seeing evil in aliens, zombies or robots, Cronenberg sees horror in our sexual nature, our own flesh. Sounds like Christianity, Islam and in fact most religious and moral groups I know. Maybe the reason why they don't fall for Cronenberg is that they sense that his horror is also deliciously fascinating, desirable, in fact often irresistible. This is a forbidden fruit you not only want to taste, once you have done so, you want more and more. Just like those who watch Videodrome (the torture porn program) in the film and just can't stop.And what is the new flesh. Well if Videodrome controls us, takes over our life, then the new flesh is everything videodrome is not. It is freedom from big brother, from thought controls, small mindedness of the society, religious teachings, politics and what ever tries to tell us to look at the world only one way or follow only one road. The new flesh is what has happened with the Internet, information overload where the little man on the street has world knowledge at his fingertips and power to influence the world, even start a revolution.The film was heavily censored and was a box office bomb, grossing $2,120,439 on a budget of $5.952 million. Critics did not like it either. Time has however been kind to Videodrome. It is a cult classic today, on many of the most respected film lists in the world. It influenced films like The Ring series and The Matrix series and has even such a huge cult status that Universal Pictures is making a remake of it, updated with modern technology, which would, sadly make Videodrome everything it was fighting against. Part of the recycled trash we are feed every day. I have only one thing to say to that; ""Long live the new flesh!""",Videodrome
143,charlietuna,Its ambiguity saves and kills...,6,1 September 2001,"First off, I write about ""Videodrome"" with the full acknowledgement that in 1983 David Cronenberg was establishing himself as one of the more original directors of his time.  The 1980's was overloaded with drek, and this film reset the bar.  ""Videodrome"" was Cronenberg's follow up to ""Scanners"".  The film held together for 3/4 of its length before it drifted off into unintelligible ambiguity.  Yet, it is exactly this fact that kept me from ultimately disliking the film as a hole.  While I found the ending and the ultimate uselessness of the James Woods character unsatisfying, Cronenberg's failure to draw a discernable line between the ""new flesh"" and ""Videodrome"" led to some stimulating conversation. Concepts surrounding the purification of the flesh permeated many of his follow up efforts from ""The Fly"" to ""Existenz"" and over the years, he has improved on his ability to express them.  Cronenberg has never made enjoyable films, yet he often makes ambitious ones. He is perhaps the only man crazy enough to make ""Naked Lunch"" and wrestle with Georges Bataille in ""Crash"".  Love him or hate him, you have to respect the level of cinema he brings to the masses.",Videodrome
144,Mr Pants,"Soon, we will all have ""special names""",10,11 December 2000,"I was just thinking about Brian O'Blivion's first scene in this movie. He explains that ""O'Blivion"" is not the name he was born with, that it's his ""television name,"" then goes on to predict that ""soon, we will all have ""special names."" Now, 17 years later, how many of us are now divided into cubicles, staring at a screen, using our ""special names""? Of course ""Mr Pants"" is not my real name, it's my internet name ...Had Cronenberg been able to forsee the advent of the Web, he could have made some very interesting insights about it with Videodrome. But in some ways I think I appreciate it more without its connections. Its dated aspects only serve to make it seem all the more prophetic.",Videodrome
145,arminhage,A NOTHING movie!,4,15 September 2014,"Well the screenplay had minimal holes or lets say, Cronenberg managed to fill up the numerous plot holes to deliver a semi solid story however in terms of screenplay, the movie still is a disaster. Aside from an interesting opening, it fails to give the hero a clear goal to achieve and also it fails to give the evil organization a clear representative as a nemesis thus the movie becomes rather pointless and the audience does not know what he should expect out of the movie. Movie is rather short, about 83 minutes if we discard the closing credits, so the time ticking fast and by time goes on it becomes more and more obvious to the audience that there would be no clear and satisfying outcome to the movie. I guess Cronenberg wanted to give the movie a somehow intellectual theme but he also failed in that field because the movie offers no tangible concept. I hate to make comparisons but probably ""invasion of the body snatchers"" is a good example of a movie with rather similar theme however that movie despite a cheesy plot (a shared trait) offered a tangible concept that can be extended to real life. Like lets say an evil organization aimed to anonymously occupy key government positions to control the nation but this movie had no concept that can be extended to real life. It leaves the audience highly unsatisfied and gives the impression that Cronenberg came to an idea just to make another movie and tried to sew some stuff together to sell it to investors and of course that is what people do in Hollywood and the result is to keep the business going on with a flood of commercially viable but forgettable movies. I guess what made this movie something to remember was the special effects which were pretty good for 1983, openly grotesque scenes which so many people love to see and also some pretty good pornographic with a sex idol like Debby Harry. Again I'm not against these things, that's how the business works and a movie needs to sell but what I'm saying is that this movies does not deserve to be cited by critics or be on Criterion Collection. It was just a movie deemed for entertainment which was partially fulfilling but mostly failure even in that respect. Also it appears that the movie was not a commercially successful nor a disaster probably due to the mentioned facts. Bottom line, it was a NOTHING movie!",Videodrome
146,Xploitedyouth,Huh?,5,11 March 2006,"David Cronenberg is an acquired taste which I have not quite acquired. That isn't to say I don't admire his films, as movies like NAKED LUNCH, CRASH and SCANNERS have proved memorable and bold. His work, however, is almost frustratingly obtuse, punctuated by grisly, bizarre and perverse imagery that can turn the most hardened of stomachs. VIDEODROME is no exception. Starting as a satire on man's fascination and obsession with television, it evolves rapidly into a hallucinogenic mind-warp that left me scratching my head more often then picking my brain. Cronenberg trademarks, like phallic and vaginal imagery, kinky heroines and sleazy heroes, are all here in graphic display, but their portrayal alternates between oddly beautiful to fetishistic and obscene. Obviously, this is all part of the plan, and like I said before, I admire much of it. It's when the film lowers itself to pseudo-psychobabble and heavy-handed contemporary mysticism that I lose focus, and the entire film just rates as a large question mark.",Videodrome
147,stmichaeldet,Long Live the New Flesh!,10,4 February 2006,"Videodrome is the story of Max Renn, small-time cable channel owner torn between the mysterious, competing forces attempting to exploit the brain-changing, hallucinogenic properties of the broadcast signal of the title program. Max's channel is pure bottom-of-the-barrel, give-the-people-what-they-want sleaze, which makes the Videodrome program (featuring random scenes of torture, mutilation, and death in a single, stark room) perfect for his audience. As he is drawn into the struggle, he loses his grip on reality, and his world becomes increasingly bizarre and nightmarish.Cronenberg is at the height of his abilities here. Everything - dialog, sets, cinematography, editing - is carefully designed to echo his themes of television as an extension of consciousness (the ""retina of the mind's eye"") and the changes it causes to our perceptions. The result is a multi-layered feast of imagery that only becomes richer on repeated viewings.",Videodrome
148,S_dot_M_dot,Bleak,7,27 October 2021,"As small-time local television producer Max Renn (James Woods) searches for the next big thing in late night TV, he stumbles upon a strange broadcast. Max's girlfriend, radio personality Nicki Brand (Debbie Harry), helps uncover the ones behind the broadcast. As Max aims to take control of the situation, Videodrome has other ideas.David Cronenberg creates a morbid landscape that focuses on the internal struggle with letting out who you really are. He does this masterfully, and brings the viewer down the twisted rabbit hole. On a technical level, Videodrome mixes a soundscape and production design that make you feel like you are sitting right next to the characters. The practical effects are also very well utilized like Cronenberg films in the past.James Woods does a fantastic job showing the slow decent into madness. You see the wear in his eyes that lets you know he has lost himself in the role. Debbie Harry compliments him with her own portrayal of madness. They both have dark desires they only let out once they have experienced Videodrome. When the top billed actors have an onscreen relationship that feels genuine, the viewer buys into the final product at a much deeper level.When getting deep into the plot of this film, there are some unanswered questions that could shed light on otherwise confusing elements of the story. The short runtime, while perfect for pacing, makes it difficult to translate what the director is trying to say. This film is also very bleak and the viewer may fall into their own trance if going into this film with no prior knowledge.This is a sci-fi MasterClass taught by a true craftsman. Videodrome still holds up and is relatable in today's world, and that is why it continues to find new viewers.

149,auberus,"Has ""Virtuality"" become our Reality?",9,29 February 2008,"Videodrome is a complex film. It is a genuinely original film. There is a before and an after Videodrome. In fact with Videodrome, David Cronenberg re-invented Sci-Fi. Mr. Cronenberg already mentioned in the book ""L'Horreur Intérieure: les films de David Cronenberg"" the fact that Videodrome was suppose to be complex: ""I tried to make a film as complex as Reality is for me. I believe the film to be very ambiguous, it feeds from different energy sources and it is very complex. I wanted the film to be like that because Reality is like that"" It is interesting to comprehend what Videodrome is all about. And how the battle of the Mind is taking place in front of the TV Screen. How Reality can in fact have different feasible definitions and how one of these definitions can take over the other depending on how our perception of this Reality can be influenced or and manipulated. The story of Max Renn, the controversial president of channel 83 that broadcasts programs of soft core pornography and high core violence is a terrific vehicle to understand what Virtual is and if Virtual can become a possible alternative to our current Definition of Reality. Max Renn is looking for breakthrough programs that answer the need of his targeted niche viewers. Whilst looking for those he stumbles across a ""snuff program"" broad-casted it seems out of Pittsburgh. This Program is ""Videodrome"". Soon Max Renn starts to hallucinate. Are those hallucinations real, are we hallucinating with him? What has become his Reality? Why and how is that possible? Is he manipulated by an obscure Political and fanatic Organization, Producer of the program Videodrome? As Nicki Brand a Radio personality, embodiment of Max Renn's Fantasy (and soon his love interest) says in the film, ""we live in over stimulated times we create stimulation for its own sake"" and ""we always want more whether it's tactile emotional or sexual"". But what we feel is our Reality. So if the TV Screen manages to make us feel something then it manages to provide us with an alternative definition of Reality. But David Cronenberg goes further Imagine you could create your own Reality in the Flesh! Guess what, Media Prophet Professor Brian O'Blivion has just done that. He has created ""Videodrome"". The program triggers a tumor in your Brain which allows you to create your own Reality thus transforming your old Definition of Reality to a brand new one (in fact to a ""Nicki Brand"" new one). The charismatic and intriguing Professor O'Blivion says it himself ""the television screen is the retina of the mind's eyes therefore the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain therefore whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it therefore television is reality"" from an emotional perspective and now in the Flesh thanks to Videodrome. Because of that, reality is less than television. Let's try to think that through. With the film ""Videodrome"" Mr. David Cronenberg denounces the fact that our reality can be easily manipulated. The company ""Spectacular Optical"" producer of the program ""Videodrome"" is the epitome of an extreme right organization with the goal of influencing and manipulating the masses. So if we know we are being manipulated then what makes us human is the action we take to correct the situation. As Sartre said ""The only thing that allows Man to live is the Act of living"". With no action or reaction there is no Life per se TV is an extraordinary medium; it in the same time reflects and influences our society; so much so that as we saw above it can change our Reality. TV shows (but now internet), can extend our emotional experience and therefore can represent a danger by leading to some kind of desensitization and dehumanization as too much emotions kill emotion. In this regards ""long live the new Flesh"" but what is this ""new Flesh""? Is it this new Reality / ""Virtuality"" or is it our Reaction against a possible manipulation. Our reality is already half video manipulation if we are not careful it will be total manipulation. Videodrome is a visionary film even more relevant today than 25 years ago. It is a reminder of what really makes us Human. We can always make something of what society tries to make of us. Even if there is nothing real outside our perception of Reality eventually what matters is our action or reaction. And now that we are aware that reality can be bent then it is our responsibility to react or to remains cathode's sheep.",Videodrome
150,silversprdave,Weird and surreal,5,31 March 2001,"Cronenberg definitely found his style by this film.  The movie was one of the front runners in the style of mixing real and hallucinations.  The movie proceeds in a way that makes it unclear to the audience on what exactly is really happening.  I personally find that style of movie making disappointing - unless it is really done well and the audience becomes involved in what the character must feel.  I feel that this move comes up a little bit short in allowing the audience to relate to the character. Still, the movie held my interest throughout. Since I like to follow Cronenbergs work, I found this movie well worth watching, even though it is rather average, I rated it only a 5.",Videodrome
151,crystallogic,Long live the New Flesh,8,18 January 2018,"This is a deeply disquieting film that never loses it's power to make me feel unsettled. It's my favourite Cronenberg picture by a considerable margin, tough admittedly I haven't tried them all yet.You might find, in 2018, the tech to belong in a museum. maybe you don't like TV very much and so the problems of a person finding themselves in the videodrome seem remote to you. but think about it this way, then. What would today's videodrome be like? Nope, this isn't an invitation for some idiot to re-make Cronenberg's film. i'm just saying: surely this film is even more powerful today than it was in 1983? I don't like TV either. Haven't had cable for nearly twenty years! Don't miss it or want it. But ... I, and in fact most of my friends, spend an awful lot of time on the internet. I even got an Android phone, which can be used to view all kinds of video content. We don't need networks anymore. All we need is a distribution system (much cheaper and more flexible than the television network) and the people to make content.I love the notion of a signal activating something in the brain that creates a new ""growth"" that can lead to mind-altering halucinations, which stay with you and affect your reality even when you're not watching the box. That's brilliant. Also very scary to contemplate. The movie does an excellent job of pushing the ""horror"" buttons, particularly with regard to Max's situation and descent to becoming a pawn in other peoples' games. I love the way the film sets up this terrible situation and makes the audience itself feel the mounting paranoia. By the end I didn't feel anyone was trustworthy. I feel like Cronenberg revisted a lot of his films in the adaptation of The Naked Lunch, another film I really appreciated, almost as much as this one, really.",Videodrome
152,woinaroschy_1979,A movie that was made ahead of its time!,9,13 December 2010,"I have heard a lot about Videodrome and I was finally able to watch it last night. I have to admit that it was absolutely nothing of what I expected. I have not yet understood everything going on in the movie, but I guess that it's one of the points of it too...but the more I think of it, the more I am awed by the visionary clarity of Cronenberg. This movie was made in 1983, when snuff movies were a myth, when violence and sex on TV were almost inexistent, when virtual reality, computer games, 3D and Blu-Ray belonged to the science-fiction novels. And now, almost 30 years later, here we are, and Videodrome is looking more and more like a masterpiece.. You will feel confused and perhaps frustrated after watching the movie, because there's no clear message and the end comes so abruptly that you question yourself just as Max does what was real and what not. But the idea of how TV is influencing you and shaping your perception of the world around you, the idea of mass control through the mass media, the idea of giving more violence and sex to the masses to gain their attention and manipulate them, or the description of crazed murderers that are not able to discern reality from hallucinations anymore (how many cases have been there in the last few years? of crazed teenagers that believed being in a computer game or some gruesome movie? of people obsessed with TV and movie violence?) is shining out from this movie as clear as daylight and make it a prophetic vision of the world today.

154,Pozdnyshev,"Weird, Sick, but Intelligent and Haunting",8,14 July 2014,"Why do I like weird, disturbing, high-concept movies like Videodrome? Because I can relate to the eerily resonant ideas in this movie more than I can to most people. Also because I see a lot more substance in this low-budget one-off flick than I do in a more popular movie like, say, the Avengers. I think Videodrome set out to tell the truth about some seedy aspect of humanity -- that just looking at violence and sex is as addictive and mind-altering as heroin, and that S&M (like rape) is a natural parasite that exists in us all, a parasite that for the good of society really shouldn't be teased and exploited into expressing itself. That is some powerful, heady sh*t that keeps my attention -- like some mind-blowing seminar. In contrast, the Avengers is like watching a nine-year-old play with his shiny new toys. No depth, no substance, nothing interesting to say, but kinda cool to look at -- like a fireworks display.The plot is that there's a sleazy guy (Renn) who owns a small TV station that broadcasts softcore porn and trashy horror movies. Stumbling upon a secret snuff broadcast called ""Videodrome"" with the help of his transistor-headed buddy, he thinks he's found the next TV sensation. But things start getting weird when this radio personality chick he hooks up with (Nikki) watches the snuff recording with him and then is all open about her interest in not just having people cut her, but BEING ON THE SHOW. What the hell? What kind of freak is this chick? But Renn, although bewildered, goes ahead and enjoys some light S&M with her. He is a trash TV exec, after all.Renn gets more info on Videodrome with the help of an old business partner who warns him to stay away from it, but gives him the name of the guy who invented it. Turns out that Videodrome broadcasts a signal that alters the viewer's brain, and was adopted by some corporate giant (Barry) to brainwash Americans into being ""tough"" enough to compete with the people in other countries.That's the grand reason, huh? This is where my confusion starts because 1)what conflict, exactly, are they trying to prepare Americans for? Another war? 2)clearly Barry is the bad guy... but brainwashing Americans into being tough enough to survive actually sounds like not such a bad thing to do. Should Americans be left to die instead? Or is Barry lying about an impending conflict just to justify their moneymaking brainwashing scheme?Then Renn is told he's ""the New Flesh,"" which means that he's no longer a person, but an appendage of the video hive-mind. Since his consciousness is so profoundly affected by the video he's watched, he is just what the video tells him to do, and so convinced of the reality of video and TV that he thinks he'll live on in the video world after his physical body dies. Interesting esoteric concept. On another level, it could be that powerful forces wanted to use this guy's resources, so they fed him hallucinogenic drugs, then exploited his vulnerable state to manipulate him into doing whatever they want.",Videodrome

It suggests that TV programs can hallucinate viewers' mental capacities and brainwash them.  If this sounded absurd in 1983, today it looks prophetic--remember that Heaven's Gate computer cult a few years ago? James Woods stars as the president of a small Toronto cable TV station that specializes in sex, violence, depravity, and anything else that regular TV can't show.  One day his troubleshooter Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) stumbles onto a strange program called ""Videodrome"", which consists of ""torture, murder, mutilation; no plot, no characters.""

This leads him to meet some weird characters, including Brian O'Blivion (ha ha), his daughter Bionca, Barry Convex, and Nicki, who is the host of a radio call-in show.  Before long, Woods begins hallucinating after watching several episodes of ""Videodrome"", and investigates to find out who's behind it and why.  The special effects by Rick Baker are good, especially the TV set that comes to life.  Woods was born to play this kind of role, but everyone else in the film is pretty bland.  The story does get pretty lame toward the end, with characters repeatedly mentioning something about ""the new flesh"".  The ending is unsatisfactory.

This is not to say that it's a bad film (same goes for Tourneur's films), just that they haven't aged terribly well and really only register as ""average.""The film follows Max Renn (James Woods), a producer for a cable network infamous for exhibiting ultra-sexual, ultra-violent programming. When a coworker (Peter Dvorsky) shows him the show ""Videodrome,"" a plot less depiction of torture, rape and murder, he begins suffering from increasingly frequent hallucinations. This leads him to investigate exactly what ""Videodrome"" is (and exactly who's behind it).""Videodrome"" is, if nothing else, an experience. An experience of what, exactly, I can't say, but an experience all the same. The film exists in a kind of purgatory halfway between an art film and a snuff film (and certainly more surreal than frightening). It features nightmarishly vivid visuals that are surpassed only by ""Hellraiser"" (1987), which is certainly the film's most outstanding feature. One particularly striking scene depicts Renn's girlfriend, as scene through a television, stretched out and bound at her wrists and ankles. Whip in-hand, Renn strikes the back of the TV, which elicits screams and recoiling from the woman's image.All of the film's exceptional qualities (Cronenberg's astute direction, the film's Hellish art- direction, the more-than-serviceable performances by the cast), the production is ultimately dragged down by its dull and listless script. The plot seems to exist only to get Renn from one hallucination to the next.Fans of the surreal and horror will enjoy this movie for the hallucination scenes. Fans of cultural theory will enjoy Cronenberg's take on the mass media. Be warned, however, that it this is one movie that doesn't live up to all of the critical hype.",Videodrome

Extremely underrated and well ahead of it's time, it could have easily been a book written by William Burroughs or James Ballard. The thematic of this post-modern masterpiece is once again the classic Cronenberg obsession with the ways technology completely transforms the human body and soul (and vice versa).

162,ashleyallinson,Why Would Anyone Watch a Scum Show Like Videodrome?,10,8 February 2005,"Because it's on and is certainly more entertaining than The Beachcombers, Magnum P.E.I. or any other Canadian television programming circa 1982. Riding on the wave of his previous box-office success, Videodrome (1982) marks the first time that Cronenberg creates a story revolving around a single character. Like Donleavy's Singular Man (1964), introduction to conflict appears in the first person, point of view narrative acting as the catalyst within which Max Renn (James Woods) is to exist. There is a distinct break between what is supposed to be reality and that of hallucination (revisited later in Naked Lunch [1991]), the point to which is open for debate, a trajectory to which the film never resurfaces from. Certainly, the audience sees what Woods perceives, first person. Establishing Max Renn as head of Channel 83, the opportunist runs a Toronto-based television station geared at projecting the sensational. After picking up a renegade channel from the otherness of the third world, Max becomes the product of McLuhanesque experimentation, pulses from television signals controlling his thought processes and subsequent actions. The character of Max Renn, it is said, was modeled on Moses Znaimer, head of CITY TV, Toronto's equivalent to Channel 83: Brian Oblivion's monologues a la Speakers Corner.Our hero's artillery consists of a phallic-like extension housed in a vaginal opening. Nikki Brand (Deborah Harry) represents the desirable introduction to a product that he himself markets, perhaps an obviation that until this point was unattainable? Max's transgressive tendencies are projected through the videodrome, liberating him from the stigmatic purveyor of physical explicitness. In a sense, Cronenberg has created his notion of Videodrome both as way of weeding out and destroying cells aroused by such activity, and as a way of gauging public sentiment toward this subject matter. The film itself was exposed to the judgmental ardor: its text encompassed, picketed by female members of parliament and removed from public screening, the subtext of subtext. Cut into three versions, the television cut is laughable; the VHS version appears as mise en scène in Atom Egoyan's Speaking Parts (1989), and the old DVD contains an original theatrical trailer that is a fitting pre-curser to this masterpiece. The Criterion Collection's DVD has the following extra features:-Two audio commentaries: David Cronenberg and director of photography Mark Irwin, and actors James Woods and Deborah Harry -Camera (2000), a short film starring Videodrome's Les Carlson, written and directed by Cronenberg -Forging the New Flesh, a new half-hour documentary featurette by filmmaker Michael Lennick about the creation of Videodrome's video and prosthetic makeup effects -Effects Men, a new audio interview with special makeup effects creator Baker and video effects supervisor Lennick -Bootleg Video: the complete footage of Samurai Dreams and seven minutes of transmissions from ""Videodrome,"" presented in their original, unedited form with filmmaker commentary -Fear on Film, a 26-minute round table discussion from 1982 between filmmakers Cronenberg, John Carpenter, John Landis, and Mick Garris -Original theatrical trailers and promotional featurette -Stills galleries featuring hundreds of rare behind-the-scenes production photos, special effects makeup tests, and publicity photos English subtitles for the deaf and hearing impaired -Optimal image quality: RSDL dual-layer edition",Videodrome
163,charliesonnyray,A Complete and Utter Mess,4,19 October 2015,"I like weird movies. I love it when a film maker decides to go outside of the box and use strange and surreal stories to present unusual concepts like TV ruling our world. Croneneberg-notorious for making strange films-directed this picture and his fingerprints are all over it. The questioning of reality, the dream like imagery and the hammy acting are all part of his charm. But frankly, it simply didn't work here. The story of the film is about the head of a TV station named Max Renn that broadcasts sleazy sex-ploitation movies. He comes across a new program called Videodrome that begins to affect the way his mind works. Eventually, reality begins to unfold around him as a war between fiction, reality, and rival companies comes to the surface. Now, the main problem with this film is that it leaves the audience with more questions than answers. Now allowing your audience to think for themselves is a good thing. But allowing too many questions to be wide open isn't. In Inception, letting the audience guess whether or not Leonardo Di Caprio's character was still in a dream or not was a great use of suspense. Videodrome slowly reveals the secrets of it's world but as it does so, it begins to make less and less sense.Did that actually happen or was just in his head? Was that person real or did Videodrome mess with your head? Why is an eyewear company getting involved with TV? It is like a piece of clothing that if you just pull out a little string than the whole thing unravels and turns into a mess. Now the visuals and the special effects are very well done, I will give the movie that. That doesn't make up for the fact though that it isn't really well constructed story wise. If you want to watch a really gross body horror film that questions what reality is, go check out eXistenZ-another Cronenberg film with similar themes to Videodrome but done way better.",Videodrome
164,Alan One,Creepy eroticism and more of what Cronenberg does best,7,14 January 2000,"With the possible exception of The Fly, Videodrome best presents director David Cronenberg's main theme: how modern life can churn biology, technology, and identity into an unrecognizable mess.  In the near future, Max, CEO of a cable pornography channel, is intrigued by a snuff-film transmission one of his technicians picks up intermittently.  His appetite for the perverse is further whetted by his sexual involvement with Nicki, who flirts with self-mutilation, and expresses an interest in auditioning for the snuff show.So far, the material is pleasantly seedy, but Cronenberg has a grander vision, as we soon find out.  The bomb arrives in the form of an anonymous videotape, which, when played by Max, turns his hi-fi into a panting, sex-charged alien.  Few scenes I have viewed generate the creepy eroticism of Max running his hands over the heaving, veined surface of the television panel as Nicki beckons breathlessly from the screen.  (Probably the only competition is the typewriter sex scene from Cronenberg's Naked Lunch.)The surreal events are explained away as hallucinations generated by special televised transmissions, but Max finds that it's easier to explain the images than to escape them.  His life quickly mutates into a sprawling series of acid trips. The narrative is disjointed in a dream-like fashion, which, on subsequent viewings, seams alternately appropriate and frustrating.  As Cronenberg keeps reminding us, once you cross certain boundaries, you can't return.Although I shun using terms such as ""visionary,"" it certainly seems that Videodrome was ahead of its time in prefiguring a cyberpunk aesthetic.  (In 1983, Neuromancer still had a year to go before winning the Nebula Award.) However, Videodrome must be viewed as the negative image of cyberpunk. Instead of human consciousness actively entering a computer-generated environment, media and technology make psychedelic incursions into reality. Max himself actually assumes the role of a VCR, developing a slot for ""playing"" tapes.  He also wears a large device over his head and eyes, not to immerse himself in a virtual world, but to allow a computer to record one of his hallucinations.  It's Cronenberg's uncanny ability to turn ideas on their heads, even before we know which way is up.",Videodrome
165,noneabve1947,Just Plain Bent......,10,20 April 2010,"This movie is sorta an LSD trip without the drug. Anyone who saw this first time and was on acid first time is probably in a ""home"".The concept of TV as shorting out our brains it nothing new....and all this was before the internet. Take a look at Brainstorm, for example...or even Metropolis.The plot is scary. People are putting things on a subconscious level into our heads. Just watch any commercial and see how they do it.But this movie does it on a GUT level. Not that much gore but some way sexual images. Between Max's gun and the very vaginal opening in his stomach should be a clue. It's erotic and horrible. Adding ""Blondie"" to it sorta dated it but it was a good choice. James Woods is at his sleazy best and I agree that Cronenburg should have added Harry Dean Stanton to the cast. You can't make a more scummy or weird movie than this!!",Videodrome

167,Sam Sloan,Was Great For The First Ten Minutes,3,17 October 2009,"And then it went downhill real fast. What was James Woods thinking when he made this film? But it doesn't seem to matter because I am definitely in the minority and most people seem to think the film was great. I can understand Deborah Harry making this film though as she at the time of making this film was probably hoping to branch out from a very successful run in her musical career. I have nothing bad to say about Deborah Harry though. She acted so well and looked so great, I wondered why she didn't take Hollywood by storm, given I don't recall her in more movies since this one. And she looked great as a brunette also, though I didn't recognize her at first. Maybe it was because of her that I liked the first ten minutes where she was shown the most. Killing her off early hurt the film, I think. But James Woods didn't have to make this film as he had already established himself as an up and coming actor and his choice of being in this one thankfully didn't derail his career. I think he is a terrific actor and I've liked him in everything he has done but this one.My recommendation is to skip this one except for the first ten minutes with Deborah Harry.

170,xaggurat,Thanks to DVD,10,3 April 2005,"I rented this one in mid-80's. I was about sixteen or seventeen back then. I made a copy, because couldn't afford to buy this back then. I watched it about seven-eight-nine times, just to have a tiny clue what's the film was about in the first place, with little success. Perhaps Videodrome raised me in some ways, perhaps later I subconsciously educated myself in a manner which would help me understand this movie. Perhaps I'll be the next Professor O'Blivion.Perhaps not.I had a habit to loan it to my girlfriends and female friends to see what they thought about it. None of them liked it, some didn't even watch it to the end. So, I guess it's the ultimate guy movie. Although later in my life I've met few women who might honestly like it. I tossed the copy when the tape was worn out in the early 90's. Now, thanks to DVD I have a copy again. Will not watch it though. Yet.How to rate Videodrome with 1-10? Acting is good, but not the best I've seen. The story is odd, strange, original but it's not the most strange or original I've seen. Videodrome feels like an excellent movie, but there's something so bad, something which could make it a terrible movie if I just could name it. In any case there should be more movies like Videodrome. It's only too bad that almost whole movie production business is filled with snotty bastards who will continue to produce similar crappy movies using same unimaginative writers and directors directing same bad actors year after year in the name of holly $ and pleasing masses.",Videodrome
171,Django-21,Cronenberg's finest!,10,30 October 2002,"Videodrome is one of my absolute favourite films.  Cronenberg's most engaging film.  It explores the nature of addiction, obsession, the growth of video technology and the  increasing power of the media in a fascinating way. I'm a big Blondie/Deborah Harry fan and this film gives Debbie one of her most interesting film roles.  Her sexual presence is used to blinding effect here and she still speaks fondly of this role and working with Cronenberg. This film made me a fan of James Woods and he gives one of his finest and quintessential performances. The plot concerns Max Renn (Woods), head of a cable station in Toronto, who becomes exposed to a pirate tv show. Intrigued by the show's content he begins to explore it's origins and finds some unsavoury connections and worse, that the signal is responsible for his growing hallucinations of a violent and sexual nature. Thus the film deals with the themes of hallucination, the mental state and personal disintegration of the main character and explores the notion of ""what if"" violent and sexual imagery really could influence a viewer. You see everything in the film from Max Renn's point of  view and so are unsure of exactly how much is hallucination or real.  Videodrome can be seen as a turning point for writer/director David Cronenberg, away from the simpler shock horror movies of his past (Shivers, Rabid etc) and onto more serious and acclaimed works (Naked Lunch, Crash). Videodrome is hard to classify as it blends elements of science fiction. horror and thriller and deals with complex issues and storyline.  Although far more ambitious in plot and characters than the average 80s horror movie, Videodrome shares the prevalent trend of special effects and special make-up and indeed foresees later films like ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Society"" in it's subversion of reality.Videodrome defies traditional structural values to an extent.  Max Renn is amoral, cynical and discontent before his exposure to Videodrome's addictive and dangerous signal.  However if contact with Videodrome is his problem then the film offers no conventional happy ending.  The conclusion is open to various interpretations and comes as a numbing experience to close a darkly cynical, gritty and intelligent film. Part of the film's lasting appeal is that the film allows the viewer to delve into the central character's enigma as he tries to unravel the secrets of Videodrome and get some grasp over his changing mental/physical state. As with Michaelangelo Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", fact and illusion are inextricably linked.  Like ""The Prisoner"" series (devised by Patrick McGoohan) the film rewards the  viewer with a plot dramatically engaging and yet one which may never be completely unravelled. Many of the characters will seem familiar archetypes. Max Renn is an anti-hero and his obsessive quest invokes comparison with the anti-heroes of film noir. Brian O'Blivion is the eccentric scientist whose ideas are misused by others.  Nicki Brand (Deborah Harry) is the ideal femme fatale and female fantasy figure. However, Cronenberg's writing and direction gives the familiar character types the depth of a new edge and fresh realism.Videodrome is a compelling and addictive film.",Videodrome
172,jacobconnelly-47681,Maybe I Just Don't Get It,5,8 August 2019,"I can't deny that Videodrome has a great concept. It's a winner. James Woods and Debbie Harry make a great on screen team and the special effects are gooey, gross, and disturbing. So, why can't I enjoy this movie?It starts off well with a local TV programmer who stumbles upon a series of hardcore, sexually changed torture films that he picks up on a satellite. He records them and feels like they'd be a great fit for his sleazy porn channel, but the more he researches the creator of these videos, the more his reality turns into rubber and he finds himself living in a nightmare.One could say Videodrome is like a thinking person's version of Ringu (or The Ring) and was ahead of its time. There's the mysterious video tape, the search for its creator and origin, and the lead character's life turning into a waking nightmare, but Videodrome stops being interesting 45 minutes in, but keeps going and going without much point. Yes, there are some great special effects in the final act, but you can never figure out why you're seeing what you're seeing and they don't feel like they're there to serve the plot or characters. It feels like Cronenberg showed up to set with an hour's worth of legitimate material and made up the last stretch of the film as he went along.There's a lot to admire and enjoy in Videodrome, but a lot of it is very frustrating.",Videodrome
173,Rufus-T,Something dark and dangerous and intelligent from Croneberg,8,19 July 2009,"My feeling for early Cronenberg films are not fond. I was expecting another gruesome, perverted, weird, and senseless movie, like The Fly & Crash. It was gruesome; it was perverted; it was weird; but it was far from senseless. The movie was a social commentary about what we see on the TV screen. The lead character played by James Woods played a TV producer of an extreme TV station that provides porn and other forbidden materials on regular TV. He came across, through a spying satellite by a friend, a type of show called Videodrome which is fake snuff films. After he saw one of those film, we saw, in satirical style, how he was affected. I was very fixated to the story. Debbie Harry of the Blondie played his girlfriend. She was well casted as a mischievously twisted woman.",Videodrome
174,Gray_Balloon_Bob,An adventure in a nightmare that probably requires multiple visits.,8,3 February 2015,"This is my second recent foray into the world of Cronenberg, and it just got infinitely more unhinged. In fact so unhinged that the door promptly collapsed and I fell forward into a strange world of ill- defined, amorphous strangeness, a world that left me like Alice without any wit. Whereas Eastern Promises played like a relatively straightforward drama, but with brooding human exploration in the corners, this is Lynchian, a bizarre psychosexual landscape that has no discernible markings of reality's beginning or end. Can I possible recall what happened, never mind why it happened? Initially, it's structured like some Stephen King-esque mystery- horror, in which we follow James Woods, a sleazy, exploitative, my morals-are- as-malleable-as-playdoh cable-executive, who discovers a mysterious, lurid broadcast signal of quasi-Japanese game-show torture porn and wants to sell it, and despite the uncomfortable air and the apartment of dirt and cold pizza in which he dwells, there's some slight charm in his edge, enough of the mundane ordinariness in him that we can sympathise when he begins to venture out of his depth and grow Freudian vaginas on his stomach that also function as safety- deposit boxes. And once this signal is discovered, and a dirty and detached Debbie Harry enters into his life, reality begins to crinkle like tissue paper. This film has a fixation on video, which functions as important plot- devices among other things, and feels like it is perfectly at home in the world of dubious video-rentals. It has a cold, closeted grimy feel to it, like it could be schlock of the 80s, but it's far too sophisticated for that. From the beginning of the film, which opens with a video recording of a woman supposedly talking to James Woods, our confidence in reality is being uprooted, the relationship between the video-world, however fictitious, and our current here-and-now reality is being played with and tested. James Woods's character seems to be a connoisseur of the form, living much of his life supposedly in front of the TV, sustaining relationships even through the TV, in the form of the aforementioned video tapes. The film has an almost fetishistic interest in tapes, with them being inserted into the body, at various points in the film. Now this leads into two interesting areas.Firstly, the make-up and special effects. David Cronenberg's earlier output is known for its wild, brazen and wry willingness to stir the audience with its gruesome practical effects. These really don't disappoint. Here we get all manner of the grotesque, (credit of course to Rick Baker for making this all possible) from a writhing and almost sensual television set, to the complete mutilation of a human body. It's hilarious and unsettling yet it's never indulgent, and always feels like it's in service of something. Cronenberg seems interested in exploring the extreme possibilities of the human condition, like what happens when violence takes hold of us? What do we become? In Eastern Promises, when the camera lingers on the sight of a slit throat, it's not indulging but forcing us to witness the truth of this reality. At the end of this film, after many incomprehensible plot turns, a man is shot and we watch as is body seems to eviscerate itself as if the internal is trying to escape the internal. We see all of this because Cronenberg is concerned with the entire body; our entire physical form exists, and is vulnerable. In I think the film's only moment of intimacy, James Woods and Debbie Harry are splayed out, entirely naked together, indulging in their carnal appetites. Of course, the mind and the body are inextricably linked, and one does not do something without the other. This leads to the second area, of what the films ideas actually are.It's hard to comprehend this film, in the latter half at least, when James Woods is so lost in a chasm between reality and unreality, and new revelations are being thrust upon him at every turn. I think there's some sort of new-order, dystopian thing going on, about harnessing the human weakness or propensity for this violence and using it for things and stuff and dubious machinations, but maybe it's all psychological, or metaphysical. The gore and surrealistic metamorphoses all serve a purpose, and talk about the underlying conditions of the characters, and this world. There's the obvious things, like the tape insertion, whereby the human becomes the direct, physical receiver of this content, and so I suppose rather than experiencing something vicariously, you are experiencing it, or you are actually it. You in this case being James Woods. It's also information being directly plugged into the body, which offers much squeamishness and more opportunities to adore the effects on display. So are people's relationships with television so severe that we're psychologically reliant on them? There's more than simple condemnation of our tele-saturated world going on here, it's Cronenberg after all, this strikes me as the sort of film that would a topic of study on a University course. In the end, a television explodes in a propulsion of human gore, suggesting that we have become inextricably bound with the technology, to a questionable degree. Cronenberg does extremes, like parody which creates an exaggerated display of its subject, Cronenberg's extremes are human hypotheticals, not realist portrayals. ""Long live the new flesh!"" becomes a cultist chant iterated throughout the film. Maybe this new flesh is just the next of our relationships with the next of our technology, a process that will continue until one engulfs the other. At least we're not flailing cancerous arm-guns that have attached malignantly to our bodies. Not yet.",Videodrome
175,Irate_Tyrant,Videodrome,10,26 July 2006,"""The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye. Therefore, the television screen is part of the physical structure of the brain. Therefore, whatever appears on the television screen emerges as raw experience for those who watch it. Therefore, television is reality, and reality is less than television.""David Cronenberg is one of the 20th century's few outstanding philosophers. As much so, even, as he is a social scientist. That his major statements and contemplations of reality are for the most part found only as horror films that depict apocalyptic scenarios has much to do with the state of both the external politics of his times, and the internal sins of mankind which have evolved with technology to become entertainment, is far from bewildering. A fire with fire approach as strong and prolific as Cronenberg's catalogue of classic cinema is surely a sign of our times, but more importantly a reminder that progress in modern society can still be made with individual expression.His major philosophies can't be judged, they are utilized instead by fictional characters and stories that are meant to frighten while revitalize the faltering and flailing science-fiction genre. Asked to direct part of the famous ""Star Wars"" series, but declining, is just one of the more righteous moves made by anybody. His incompliance with popular culture is then evident in the slew of films that he would write during the 80's and 90's. Most of his warnings of polluting the body and mind are perfect symbols of censured values in the name of mass-marketing. His prophecy revolves around the idea of the human race replacing itself, without knowing it or seeing it coming.""Long live the new flesh!""We've all heard the phrase ""sex sells"". What is overlooked in this overused cliché of society, is that sex sells for a reason. Sex, as a mode of entertainment is a replacement for our own sins as humans. In fact, it is the most exact denial of our self-worth. Violence, too found in much of today's entertainment is a form of denying our own identification within the structure of the world. However, draw it out even further, and you'll see the grandiose picture of entertainment and art in general as an attempt, by humans, to pervert reality and escape our mortality. This trend that began with human language and evolved into writing, and recently cinema and video games, is without a doubt just as purpose-driven as religion.Enter the world of ""Videodrome"". Basing it's characters in the pornographic industry, where morals are pretty low to begin with, ""Videodrome"" sidesteps the obviousness of my earlier explanation of the nature of man's unhealthy obsessions, and ups the ante. The plot of the movie, as it unfolds, is less about heartless snuff and television piracy, and more about the danger of media as a medium of corruption of the soul. It so seems so easily we forget the rumored Japanese television program that caused it's young viewers to seizure and collapse, the role-playing suicides/homicides, or even recent occurrence of comic strip riots. Even the pieces of media violence that we retain from history, are for the most part misunderstood by our elected officials and public. Shameful T.V. news anchors broadcast disgust, made-for-T.V. movies are made, politicians organize boycotts and censorship committees. But each time, the industry of commerce will just push the boundaries further.Andy Warhol proclaimed ""Videodrome"" to be the ""A Clockwork Orange"" of the 1980's. Whether he was referring to the movie or book wasn't made clear. I personally, find myself when introducing ""Videodrome"" to friends, as a combination of ""The Ring"" and ""The Matrix"", with twice the horrifying effect of both together. The paradox of ""Videodrome"", is that while it is, itself, an extremely perverted concept, it never accepts that being a portrayal of deviant art is any more abstract than viewing the deviant artist at work. Sensibly, it constructs out of illusion, and destructs out of realization of powerlessness to it's own magnetization into the evil of reality.John Woods plays the central character, a pornography channel's executive. We see him struggle to understand his marriage, to fulfill his need to expand his empire, to battle his conscience, to ultimately feel the sensation of love. Yet he never shows his inner self, and only through our own struggles with the same problems do we realize what he is going through.Special effects are over-the-top, as well they should be. Metamorphosis of the physical body in this movie are probably representative of the distortion of television on the human psyche. ""Videodrome"", with all of it's philosophy and dissection of entertainment is a masterpiece. Calling into question not only our morality, but our judgment as well.""You'll forgive me if I don't stay around to watch. I just can't cope with the freaky stuff.""""Videodrome"" (1983) 10/10",Videodrome

Even though I am a huge Cronenberg fan, this is the one movie I never got around to seeing until tonight and as the tittle of my review says, it blew my mind. I'm not really in the mood to get into any deep analysis of Cronenberg's social commentary on technology, psychology or government. I'm also not in the mood to get into any deep analysis about metaphysics but I could ramble on about all those elements after watching it. All I will say is that if you are a Cronenberg fan or a fan of movies that will make you think as opposed to the common Hollywood garbage that tries to prevent you from thinking....then see this movie.

Perhaps if you are in a certain state of mind and/or enjoy psychoactive substances, you can enjoy this movie, but otherwise, it will probably just leave you with a sense of ""I have no idea what is going on"" and ""That makes no sense"" - even if you keep your wits about you it seems to veer off on tangents and loses cohesion regularly, and from the start.Maybe for the cult lovers who like spending afternoons at movie houses watching obscure films, it will be interesting (if they manage to make sense of, or rather, are able to absorb the bizarre sequence of events).Of course it includes all the ""obligatory"" elements a movie like this is supposed to have to keep the interest of the already more limited crowd this was aimed for, but even those seem forced, and don't seem to be included but for the sheer fact that it's customary. It doesn't add anything to the movie.All in all, too bizarre and outlandish for its own good.",Videodrome

The film entails Max Renn brilliantly brought to life by James Woods as a low-budget cable television programming director, bored with life and seeking kicks through violent video stimuli...He happens to stumble across the violent and sadistic 'Videdrome'. As a consequence, his life is slowly transformed into a hellish and surreal nightmare.

Of course, it was way ahead of it's time. Even now, it's probably way ahead of this time.The acting is top notch, and so are the visual effects - gotta love those organic gore effects compared to nowadays' over-used CGI - and photography. ""Videodrome"" is a very psychedelic movie, and the effects support it excellently.The music was OK, nothing stood out, but it did it's job of accompanying the movie throughout the whole trip.My only complaint is that, in the end, it felt like something was missing. Not sure what, can't quite put my finger on it, but the feeling is present.The plot is very complex and psychological which will make you think and draw your own conclusions. It's widely open for interpretation.If you enjoy surreal, crazy, disturbing, psychological and psychedelic movies, this one is most definitely for you.""Death to Videodrome!

182,Myusersnameiscoolokay,Heavy on the fiction. Heavier on the weird.,7,12 April 2015,"Videodrome [1983] is the science-fiction classic (by critically acclaimed director David Cronenberg) which introduces Max Renn, a cable TV executive on the search for the newest frontier of sexually explicit and violence- centered programming. Max Renn (acted by James Woods) is alerted to 'Videodrome', a pirate signal exclusively broadcasting scenes of violence, torture and murder. Unexpected turn. The setup is a perfect beginning for a captivating mystery thriller. Further into the film, weird imagery pops up thick and fast. Part frightening, part disturbing, part nauseating. From one scene to the next, convoluted and silly sci-fi elements creep in and figuratively consume any semblance of logic. How the hell did we get here? Deborah Harry. Playing love interest to Max Renn, she sells each line and is mesmerizing in her scenes. Written intriguingly complex for a supporting role. Besides being Nikki Brand, the masochistic psychiatrist and radio host, you never get to find out what her deal is. Videodrome avoids going into depth about anything besides the science-fiction story line. Remarkably unusual. A male extra wears too much eye shadow. Inanimate objects start to pulsate. James Woods loses the plot. Deb Harry likes it rough. An old woman is peddling porn. So strange in fact, it differentiates itself to the point of becoming unforgettable. The extremely gory special effects (relative to the movie gore in the 80's) just intensifies the weirder elements and oozes a degree of David Lynch.",Videodrome

185,souplipton,Disturbingly Descends into a Masterpiece of Body Horror,8,25 July 2015,"Videodrome is one of David Cronenberg's most enduring films, and there is good reason why. When Max Renn, a TV exec specializing in exploitative content, comes across a program at the extreme of this niche, his life begins to descend into nightmarish hallucinations of violence and disgust, supposedly revealing a hidden war fought over control of the airwaves. As Max's life becomes more and more insane, the borders between reality and his hallucinations becomes blurred, and while some of the events may be occurring, they are not happening the way that Max believes them to. Its comments on the nature of television's effect on humanity with its violence and dehumanization are nice, but what truly shines is the mad world of unreal hallucinations which Cronenberg creates. The imagery is powerful and shocking, and could have only come from the master of body horror. A visually great film, with a good narrative and acting, this is an important piece of the body horror canon that should not be missed.",Videodrome

Videodrome explores this concept in a very frightening way ""Is it real - or is it memorex?"" I had a truly terrifying discussion with a young man who worked for me while I was stationed in Germany. Several of us were talking about taking a tour to Amsterdam and visiting the Anne Frank museum. Seeing his glazed expression I asked him if he knew who Anne Frank was. He made a face and admitted that he knew who she was ""My English teacher made us read the book in High School."" So I asked him what he thought of it. ""Didn't like it."" he replied. I granted that the events of the book were disturbing, but what didn't he like about it? ""It wasn't real."" he replied. I was confused, and pointed out that the book was the daily diary entries of a person who actually lived and died, what could be more real than that? ""Well, you know..."" he said.

189,lachlan-mcdougall,"Yes, It's Shocking, But What's The Point?",6,17 May 2014,"David Cronenber's high-camp rumination on sex, violence, politics, and media-culture is a strange journey through the realms of low-sci-fi, high-horror, gross-out, and a myriad of other sensational modes of film making. James Woods somewhat woodenly plays Max Renn, a sleazy cable television station manager who unwittingly becomes embroiled in one of the most ludicrous plots to ever be brought to the screen.It is, apparently, the near future and a certain section of society has become hopelessly addicted to the omnipresent television cathode rays, but one company has taken things a step further and is using video cassettes of torture footage to cause hallucinations and control the minds of the world. Yes, this film makes about as much sense as that sentence.The ostensible plot, however, is not what you're really meant to focus on with Videodrome. The politics and doom and gloom prophecies are the real impetus for the film, but they too come across as about a ridiculous as the story that they fit within. I mean, desensitisation and dehumanisation are both good topics and they have been explored very well by some of the great directors (notably Kubrick with Full Metal Jacket (1987)), but Cronenberg handles these themes with about as much subtlety and tact as he handles his body-horror. The film is rife with proselytising, strange plot leaps, and unjustifiable character reactions not made any better the pathos-drenched acting by the main cast.The horror aspects of the movie, however, are spot on when one wants a piece of schlock cinema to really have some fun with. Beta-max tapes inserted into abdominal wounds, S&M brutality, hands turning into living guns: Cronenberg delivers all of the body-horror that one could want and the special effects a stunning in their grotesque realism. There is no defining moment of absolutely delicious brutality like the head explosion of Scanners (1981), but Videodrome manages to deliver a steady stream of cover-your-eyes moments.I think, this is where the real charm of a film like this lies. It is objectively a bad film in terms of plot and narrative structure, but one doesn't watch it for great art; one watches it precisely because it is bad. A great film to load up on popcorn and friends and kick back on the couch one midnight and watch in the darkness and good-humour that only awful horror can allow. It's funny in how serious it takes itself and it delivers a constant stream of gut-churning gore which somehow also become hilarious in their cartoonish caricature of real violence.This, dear readers, is one of the great video nasties of our time, and it is one which continues to hold onto its reputation as a pretentious piece of schlock long after the bar for violence was set much higher by the ensuing wave of horror films, and that, to my mind, makes it well worth watching. It is for this reason that I've decided to go ahead and rate this film twice: one rating for the criteria of what goes into making an actually good film, and another for the enjoyability of complete ludicrousness. On the first it must be said that Videodrome is complete tripe, but on the second well, you'll just have to watch it for yourself and make up your own mind.",Videodrome

Cronenberg must have been on some sort of drug when he wrote this film, and I want to know what he's on.

The mix of reality and hallucinations to drive the story onwards was executed well to begin with but fell into pure nonsense later on.I tried to enjoy it but towards the end I just sat there speechless. I don't mind subtle messages or themes which the director tries to express in a movie but if anything that I watched meant anything...well it involved looking much too deep for a normal viewing.There's also an ending that will leave you thinking, ""Why did I watch this?""

Videodrome, in-between stomach vaginas and cancer guns, raises a lot of points about our relationship with television, film and media, almost in a pre-Haneke way. It satirises the concept that has bothered parents for generations, that being that television warps our mental state, flipping it with the possibility of it changing us physically too. One of my favourite aspects of Videodrome is that while you watch it, you are perversely horrified, but even afterward, you think about the layers and metaphors it contains. It does not just contain gore for shock value. Many of the practical effects can be interpreted in various ways, like how the protagonist grows a vagina in his stomach. Yes, it is gross and nasty, but clearly thought went into this decision and what it says about the character. Is the cancer in his brain accessed possible fears of feminity, or perhaps it happened as a fitting punishment for his perverse views. This film is not just stupid crap that forces a reaction of shock and confusion, there are things to notice and pick up on.

The message that this movie puts out is great, because it is true. Yet, the scary part is how over-dramatized that message is in this movie. Americans can be consumed by television, and this can in insanity and violence. When what you see on TV becomes a part of your life, the line between reality and fictional content becomes blurred. James Woods's character in this movie lets that happen to him, but partially because it's some hallucinogens and mind-control..... I don't want to spoil it for anyone.

That said, I'd sit through almost anything to get my fill of her - even this pretentious unpleasant tosh - what can I say about the actual film? Well, It's Cronenburg, so it's meaningless drivel played for effect and calling itself a horror movie. I'm not saying Debbie Harry can save the movie, because she can't, but much less can that sleazy mediocrity James Woods. His most striking achievement seems to have come in later life; getting a cute 20-year-old girlfriend at the age of 65 (soon after having the same when he was slightly less old), and bolstering his rotting image by taking her on his arm to a premiere. Offering her a route into Hollywood, I guess, in addition to getting to hump her in the name of rescuing her from drug troubles. In fairness I'm not blaming her; many dream of walking in elite circles, but hey not everyone can have the talent of Debbie Harry, or even a sliver of it for that matter. By the way, in his 70s now I believe he has moved on to a 30-something woman - just a 40-year age gap. Clearly the man has a talent of sorts, and boy does he need to see it legitimized.",Videodrome

204,axelrose587,David Cronenberg is a genius!,9,18 November 2012,"David Cronenberg, the man, the mind. Cronenberg has made some of the most gruesome and shocking horror and science fiction films anybody has ever seen. He created a new sub genre of horror titled ""Body Horror"" in which the true horror is what goes on inside yourself. It started with Scanners (1981), and continues in his magnum opus, Videodrome. The story of Max Renn (James Woods) the owner of a controversial news station where entertainment is defined by what people can't see on other public broadcasting networks. Full of hardcore violence and nudity. Max has a friend in Harlan (Peter Dvorsky) who shows him a pirated show from Malasia called Videodrome, an hour long show filled with nothing by gratuitous torture in a red room. He also finds a woman who shares his taste in sleazy films in Nikki (Deborah Harry, of Blondie fame) a woman who enjoys the pleasure of pain. Overtime the effects of watching Videodrome take over Max's mind and drive him to madness. He is forced to kill. The special effects were done by Rick Baker, best known for his Academy Award winning special effects on An American Werewolf in London (1981). The most gruesome of the scenes is the seen where Max's stomach turns into a mouth. This was done by gluing a fake torso onto James Woods' body. The whole message of the movie is that television rots our brains and we turn into nothing but mindless drones because of shows like Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We believe what the magical box tells us no matter if it is false or not *cough* FOX News *cough*. It also shows the truth that many of us do like to indulge ourselves in watching soft core sex or hardcore violence as a sick interest. Videodrome is a hard hitting movie that is more factual today than ever. Hitting us with the facts of what is fictional and realistic.

Unfortunately, I think it fell a little short of what could have been an amazing experience.Definitely ahead of its time, quite well acted and conceived, Videodrome pushes the boundaries of reality. If you're a big sci-fi fan, you may enjoy when the movie breaks those bounds. Instead, I would liked to have seen it remain more on the potentially realistic side.Without spoiling the flick, suffice it to say that Cronenberg could have stuck with delusions and mind control more to the effect of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or Vanilla Sky. Or take the path of total creepiness bordering on potentially realistic a la The Ring.Either approach would have left me loving this movie, instead of leaving it on the fence of being time well spent vesus a masterpiece.See it and decide for yourself.",Videodrome

It's never feels like it's forcing the viewer to go through something horrifying, but there are a lot of challenging images for anyone new to Cronenberg's style of film.It focuses a lot on television, which may initially feel dated, but it's commentary at times feels relevent to even more modern forms of media consumption. Sometime the tone comes across as weirdly alarmist, but never to the point of being distracting.The film gets a bit lost in it's own sauce by the end of it, but it's not for lack of visually captivating moments and some fun narrative mind play.I'm brand new to Cronenberg and this film does support his reputation.

I watched this movie a few months ago and was astonished. In my country, you don´t find this movie easily (blockbuster or any regular video store doesn´t have it), so when i could finally watch it, my expectations were the highest, because Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors. And i wasn´t disappointed. Videodrome became one of my favorite movies, and i have to tell you why. The story is just amazingly imaginative, there are so many memorable sequences (remember the gun hidden, typical Cronenberg), it is surreal and complex. Cronenberg perfectly manages to tell the audience just the necessary elements. The rest is up to you. Please join the amoral Max Renn (James Woods) on this highly disturbing trip through the human mind, trespassing the thin line between sanity and madness and confusing the fantasy from reality (sounds familiar? let´s say the Matrix? only that this one is from 1982). As said above, this movie is pure Cronenberg, and once again proves that this is one of the most profound directors, because he has developed certain themes along his career and has explored them in different ways. This themes are, for example: the limits of the flesh; man vs. technology; and morbid physical manifestations as a product of psychological distortions.Ahhh yeah, how could i forget what happened to Barry Convex.

209,CLewey44,Here's the deal.....,7,28 March 2007,"I own Scanners, Dead Zone, Videodrome, and The Fly. Overall, I like these movies, but they all have one thing in common for sure, and that is they all start out good and have a good idea, but by the end of the movie, you are like, ""What was that?"" or ""Why didn't they go this way with the film?"" For example, ""Scanners"", the guy had the ability to do what he could do, but didn't use it convincingly or very well. I felt Ironside in that movie should have been the good guy, not the bad guy, which he played very well I might add. The last scene where him and his brother have a scan off, his transformation was very intense. It could have been used as his comeback on a bad guy, the ultimate Michael Ironside Scan. And with ""Videodrome"", how cutting edge and creepy it was until he started having the hallucinations(?), then it got way too out of control and over the top, which I've come to expect from a Cronenberg film. But it would have been even better had they kept the over-the-top sci-fi stuff out and made it about the cable company broadcasting such trashy stuff and maybe finding out it was real death they were watching. That could have been the mystery. Finding out where this was going on. They should have stuck with the whole ""snuff"" t.v./ S&M stuff.I watched Videodrome last night and was really really into it, until he lost his gun in his stomach, the gun grew into his hand sometimes, and sometimes it wasn't. If you buy this, don't get Criterion version, you might be disappointed. But this release for like 8 or 10 bucks is well worth it, especially for Cronenberg fans.",Videodrome
210,flobbergobber,weird,8,17 October 2006,"A David Cronenburg number, interesting if you replace the theme of videos and their effect on society with the internet. debbie harry is well fit in it.it was a strange film in many ways, but what else do you expect from cronenburg? the effects were dated, but still suited the film, as it was certainly of the moment, and any attempt to remake o film like this with modern technology would certainly make for a more dated affair.i thought debbie harry did a pretty good job (not just cos she looks nice!) - not sure if she did any other acting work, but it would good to see it if she did.http://lotsofpopcorn.blogspot.com/",Videodrome
211,Funeral Laugh,Criterion's New Flesh,9,17 July 2005,"Pros: It's a Cronenberg film with extras. Cons: Cut footage for the feature not replaced.This is not entirely a movie review, but a DVD review. This may contain some spoilers, but will not go into detail of the plot. Please consult another venue for information on the movie itself.This is Cronenberg. How can you deny a Cronenberg horror/sci-fi film? You can't, really. And you must be a fan of David's or you wouldn't be reading this. Because to fork out the nice sum to purchase the Criterion Videodrome, you're either a Criterion Collector or an avid David Cronenberg fan.But, there's a catch.Criterion in the past has come out with some decent stuff. Sometimes there's an excellent transfer and restoration, and most of the times they have excellent extras that you can view for hours, if not, days.But, there's still a catch.For those of you who haven't seen Videodrome, I recommend that you search previous venues to see what this feature entails. For those of you that know this film well, prepare for David's head to become a reality.Maybe because I'm so used to viewing restored, digitally enhanced films, that I can't see any difference in the video and sound quality. It's been sometime since I've seen the VHS version, admittedly. But, shouldn't I at least go, ""Wow! this looks like it was filmed this year!"" It's hard to tell, but perhaps I was so engrossed into it that I didn't care. The extras, on the other hand, that was something different. I loved to see the interviews, all those publicity photos and photos of cut scenes, the monotone commentaries, the f/x foo.... oh wait. Did I say cut-scene PHOTOS? Photos? Let me see this right... they release the film that is the (quote from box) ""new high-definition digital transfer of the unrated version..."". OK.. gotcha. But, why-oh-why did you not replace the cut scenes that were depicted in the stills library? Perhaps I didn't listen or read too well that perhaps the scenes were scrapped, but it never caught my attention. Did I see it wrong? If there are still cut scenes in a tupperware box somewhere, why would Cronenberg ""Director-Approved Special Edition"" this? Oh, I mean, cool... I get some other nice extras like the full version SAMURAI DREAMS softcore porn and seven minutes of the Videodrome snuff transmissions, but where's the scenes with Woods and Harry? Should I have spent the $40 retail price for a tease put on a few photos?Yes.I love Cronenberg's disturbed little mind. Little, but brilliant. There is no director/writer out there like him. He's ahead of his time like H.R. Giger is for the art world. If Giger was to say that his SIL painting wasn't suppose to look like it does now and presents us with a photo of an old scribbled notebook paper of what it WAS supposed to appear, should I be upset? The final release is what their vision of how it should of been, and I should nod at that decision.As online costs goes down on this great viddy, should it be bought? Why, yes. Cronenberg fan or not, your world will spin in disbelief.",Videodrome
212,marshmannes,One of my all time favorites,10,30 April 2008,"David Cronenberg is a great filmmaker and this is one of his best. The sci-fi horror mix is well done with a dash of satire. This is one of those films that needs to be seen multiple times as there is always something new every time you see it.The plot may seem simple at first, but the amount of symbolic imagery and dialogue used is plentiful. The acting is all around great with Woods and even Deborah Harry being standouts here. The Rick Baker helmed makeup and CGI free effects are very well done and while gory, they fit the purpose of the film and are not just there to gawk at. Watch it for the plot first and see the film behind it because there is a lot more to it than you might believe.A surprising amount of satire is even thrown in to seeing how we think of the world of how desensitization of violence leads to violence to real life even though it may not even be there. The interesting thing is that we are seen to believe that, but Cronenberg is showing that it's a satire of how we perceive the media to be even though it really isn't that way. This is one of those films you talk about after you watch it and it unleashes some good questions about the media and how issues that may not even be there and how if there is something you don't like, all you have to do is not watch it.Is it all real or is it not, watch the movie and see for yourself. This is one of Cronenberg's best films and one of my favorite films. You just don't see films like this anymore that can make you think and be disturbed at the same time.10/10 Unrated: Strong Violence/Gore, Sexual Situations, Nudity, Language",Videodrome
213,userofthewheel,No one ever comes back next week,8,15 October 2004,"One of my favourites this film. Seen originally in the mid 80s I watched it again last week.Woods gives a manic performance as a TV exec suffering hallucinations after watching some snuff video transmissions from Pittsburgh. Debbie Harry has a cameo as an S&M obsessed radio DJ who audtions for Videodrome never to be seen again. Best scene is where Harlan ""wants to play something"" for Max and pulls a chewed up arm out of his chest with a WWI German hand grenade attached to it! Ridiculous world domination attempt by the Chairman of a company that makes spectacles completes it all really.All in all the usual Cronenberg fare of good music score and grotesque FX. 7/10Videodrome - is that a Japanese configuration?",Videodrome
214,arpanmallick007,"amazing, disturbing, weird, brilliant",7,20 November 2012,the body horror concept of Cronenberg was never so much profound before this film. videodrome is a kind of film that shares the same characteristics of eraserhead. the environment is largely surreal. the sound effects and images are edited to make you feel nauseating. in a better word it is techno-surreal film with a greater message to the society but obviously not decipherable by everyone. this film will cut deep into your mind and play with it and there lies the success of the film. this is an example of enormous visionary and skillful direction.finally the make up effects really deserve huge praise. it is just awesome.,Videodrome
215,austelwx,Overrated & tepid,2,26 December 2016,"""Videodrome"" has a lot of small elements with potential, but it never develops any of them into a worthwhile payoff. Some viewers might be dazzled if it's their first time ever seeing a movie that isn't 100% Hollywood clichés, but if you want a memorable story, good characters, or a powerful experience, Videodrome will be a waste of time. Even if we set aside characters & story, this film simply fails to be exciting or fun unless you are very easily impressed. Given this flick's overblown reputation, I guess there are a lot of easily-impressed people out there.Many people consider this film shocking and dark, but it simply isn't! All the ""gory"" or ""twisted"" scenes are either lightweight or silly- looking. James Woods discovers a secret TV broadcast of torture scenes called Videodrome. The characters never shut up about how twisted & violent these scenes are, but they look like every amateur torture scene from a zero-budget movie. It's just some guy lightly smacking a toy ""whip"" against a woman's ribs, & then she vaguely flinches in the wrong direction. There are also some incredibly boring ""S&M"" scenes which had me laughing because they were so dull & tame, yet Cronenberg gave them huge dramatic emphasis like they were totally edgy.People also LOVE to call this film ""prescient,"" but the social commentary just amounts to clichés about how TV controls people & can be a propaganda tool. These ideas had already been around for decades. If anything, the film's themes are downright conservative, especially with its almost 1950s-esque fear of sex & violence!Sure, the film belabors some ""creepy"" imagery, but all of this is frankly cartoonish & wacky instead of disturbing. You'll find more disturbing imagery in an episode of Ren & Stimpy.Returning to plot and characters: This movie halfway develops LOTS of ideas, then just fails to deliver on anything. The plot starts off as social commentary, then forgets about this completely. James Woods has a friend named Masha who gets just enough screen time to feel tedious, then abruptly disappears from the story. The film heads in a surreal, otherworldly direction, then has a clichéd third act where James Woods just has to kill some paper-thin bad guy who wants to rule the world.James Woods as Max Renn does an OK job in the lead role, but his character never develops; calling him 2-dimensional feels like an overstatement. Max' buddy Harlan is quirky, but the actor fails ridiculously any time he has to emote. The women in the film are HORRIBLY directed: every single one of them is stilted & unnatural. Sonja Smitts and Debbie Harry share the gimmick of talking... really... REALLLLLY... slowly, because Cronenberg thought this sounded dramatic. It doesn't. Neither of them ever emote, unless you count the same exact head-bobbling movement Cronenberg (that creative genius) had them do. This is a huge problem when they both have such important characters with heavy screen time!The film has a villain who is never threatening, compelling, or interesting. He is supposed to be a powerful corporate executive, but he has NONE of the strength or charisma such a man would need. He acts more like a manager at a shoe store or something. This is also a problem, since we're supposed to take him seriously as a threat.And then there are minor characters like Masha, played by Lynne Gorman. Gorman talks and talks for way too long, and she never acts. She just says her lines in a ridiculous vaguely foreign-y accent. This might have sounded cool and dramatic in the '50s, but in the '80s it's just plain stupid and laughable.When I saw all these shoddy details piling up, I only hoped that Videodrome would end on a comedic note, with a self-aware punchline recognizing how stupid it was. Perhaps the whole thing would be a satire on the scifi trends of the '80s! But no, the film ends with no irony, no energy, nothing to make its 90-minute runtime worthwhile to anyone who isn't easily-impressed.",Videodrome
216,luigimarchini,It lingers in the mind,8,27 October 2005,"Videodrome, to my mind, is a really underrated film. When people assess Cronenberg they tend to focus on Crash, Dead Ringers and The Fly, but this is just good as these (and in Dead Ringers case, better). First let me say that it is not a horror film: not in the conventional sense anyway. It is a fantasy with images that are disturbing, a voyage into the recesses of James Woods mind. The pace is consistent and the tone dark all the way through; the photography fits the subject matter superbly, and even if the script is a little uneven in places, this is more than made up for by the best performance of Woods' career. A much better film than i expected.",Videodrome
217,blackandwhiteradio,In the words of SYL: All Hail The New Flesh,8,13 August 2008,"James Woods as Max Renn acts as a business owner of a TV channel. He pursues a snuff program to put on his show and encounters obstacles along the way, leading to what makes us as responders feel we are on a very bad acid trip.OK, so maybe I don't have to spell out the plot for you. GOOD BECAUSE I CAN'T. This film weaves its way in and out of different visual and emotional landscapes throughout. I'm not talking about the ""underground"" or the ""crime scene"", I'm talking about surrealism that is harder to get you're head around than a new Salvador Dali painting.David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" is one of the most powerful films I have seen and really draws the responder into the film as well. As you go through each scene you wonder, is what happening now real or not? In the sense of the world put inside the film anyway. Highly recommended and whilst not overly violent, you will find yourself very disturbed.""Long Live The New Flesh""",Videodrome
218,jake_calvit,Another Cronenberg Masterpiece,9,6 July 2004,"This is probably one of Cronenberg's best films. Cronenberg is making some really interesting comments on how television changes our perception of reality. I find the metaphors of human mutation via television/cathode rays extremely interesting. Yes the movie is extremely strange and disturbing, but after watching this film; you can't seem to get the images out of your head. Cronenberg would return to these themes in ""Existenze"". To a casual watcher of horror/sci-fi this is not an easy film to watch. Half way through the film I wasn't sure what was real or hallucination, and I think Cronenberg intended this. If you have a chance I would highly recommend this film. Watch it at least five or six times. Every time I view this film more layers are discovered. A masterpiece of the horror genre.",Videodrome
219,inked78,An Interesting Movie,7,7 August 2009,"I actually watched this film immediately after watching eXistenZ. I'll mention that I had also recently watched the (non-Cronenberg) film A Scanner Darkly. I mention this only because there is some relationship amongst these films. It was watching eXistenZ that made me want to check this one out. I've watched a few other Cronenberg films, and I liked this one. It's basically the story of a guy who gets interested (ostensibly for business purposes) in bizarre broadcasts of porn (some of which is hardcore BDSM). He runs a low-budget TV station that wants to run stuff that will attract viewers by shocking them. While attempting to track down the source of such movies, he becomes involved with a woman who is very into BDSM. At the same time he finds that, after watching the initial hacked broadcasts from the mysterious source, that he experiences bizarre and violent hallucinations. As time goes on he become increasingly unable to differentiate between these hallucinations, and reality.This film is a good example of the bodily horror genre. It has strong affinities with A Scanner Darkly, and eXistenZ, in that all three appear to feature lead characters who lose their ability to distinguish between what is real, and what is not. For the time it was made the special effects are quite good, and they don't appear schlocky for today's viewers.In addition to bodily horror, this one might dip a bit, but not fall totally into, the cyber punk genre.I would definitely recommend watching it with eXistenZ, but you should watch this one first.",Videodrome
220,Mrs. K,"Oh, man! This is just the worst!",1,3 August 1999,"My precious husband talked me into watching this on laser disc the other night, and he is really in the doghouse.  I swear, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life!  The plot was just stupid, James Woods was even more wooden than usual, and Deborah Harry looked like she belonged in some other, much more interesting movie, before disappearing halfway through.  This movie isn't so bad it's good -- it's so bad it's BAD!",Videodrome
221,peterwood,A highly creepy and original movie,10,5 September 2003,"James Woods plays a scuzzy, low-life TV producer  (the kind of character he plays exceptionally well and that you've come to love from prior performances in films like 'Salvador') who gets hooked on watching a pirate snuff film channel, but soon he discovers everything is not as it seems to be and that the transmission wasn't broadcast at all but actually a tape which brainwashes him into acts of self mutilation on his body, soon he is finds that he can hardly even control himself or his body.A great first half with terrific performances from the three leads, steps up a gear or two in the second half. A highly creepy and original movie that just gets weirder and weirder! Highly recommended. Peter.",Videodrome
222,Roel Scheijde,Cronenberg goes Japan,10,22 July 2001,"I think Videodrome is a briliant Film. I've seen it a lot and I still don't know how it ends.I'm also a fan of Japanese horror movies, and I noticed a lot of Videodrome influence there. I will list a few examples and I hope someone else can give me more Titles.Tetsuo, the way people become metal is influenced by the pistol becoming part of the hand scene (the director of Tetsuo has admitted to be influenced by Videodrome).Ringu, the way a videosignal can influence your body (Ringu is one of the scariest films i ever saw).Adition, the way reality and halucination somethimes mix into a confusion (in a good way) neverland.Evil Deadth Trap, someone seeing him/herself die on video (althoug this film has more Giallo than Cronenberg in it)",Videodrome
223,Chazo,Utterly pointless watching it,2,11 December 2009,"This film starts off with a very vague storyline, which about half way through is completely gone. I lost interest after that point, but continued watching just to mock it. If you want to watch a TV breath for five minutes, a man spend 10 minutes walking around his apartment, then putting a gun in his chest, to then pull out nearer the end to fight the imaginary 'pirate video' beast then you can watch this film. But in my view, it's a waste of time watching it. To be honest, the acting wasn't all that bad, but the concept is just weird. I didn't fully understand it and I probably shouldn't have watched it in the first place, because it wasted my time.",Videodrome
224,dovestrangler,Cronenberg's best,10,23 June 2003,"IMHO this is an absolute Cronenberg masterpiece. I have seen and liked most of his other films, new and old (The Fly, Rabid, Shivers, Dead Ringers, the Brood, Naked Lunch, Existenz), but his one just topped 'em all for me.The story is strong, the photography is surreal and the acting is mostly outstanding. The sadistic cruelty kept pumping my adrenaline slightly over the comfort level, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Even though the effects may seem a little overdone at times it all fits perfectly into the movie.I highly recommend this one! just don't watch it too often... you might end up with videodrome... ;)",Videodrome
225,arovane44,Astonishing,10,15 April 2008,"This film is probably the pick of Cronenberg's career. I remember seeing it in theater when i was young, and i can tell you that the people in the cinema couldn't believe their eyes. A lot of people went out of the theater, and I can understand why: we were in the mid 80's and very few movies were alike, at least where I come from. Since then I followed every film of Cronenberg, and he is one of my favorite director. I saw it again recently on DVD, and was surprised of how much the film didn't grow old- it is still astonishing and accurate, 25 years after its release. It is a must see for everyone, one of the best film ever, if you ask me.",Videodrome
226,nelsonharrington,Don't watch it high,10,27 May 2019,I remember watching this movie after smashing back a few doobs years ago and it has still stuck with me.

227,Jeff-39,Kill Your Television,10,22 December 2000,"I started watching this movie around 10pm one evening when I had to be to work at 5am the next morning.  I didn't get to work until 7 because I was up all night thinking about this incredibly complex and ingenious film. Videodrome's sci-fi world, where people can be controlled by scientifically engineered signals within their televisions, is not far from the real world.  Politically motivated masterminds intending to control the mass population with their subliminal television signal sounds a bit like science fiction, but I wouldn't label it as such.  Rather, the film's plot has a striking resemblance to our current reality, in which television channels, owned by large corporations, broadcast commercials that sell products, owned by the same corporations.  The television tells us where to shop, what products to buy, and how to consolidate our debt after buying all these products.  Millions fall victim to this addictive trap everyday, yet never know how their daily actions are subtly controlled by the same five corporations. Cronenberg also compares the televisual experience to that of a cult. The way his characters seek meaning in life through viewing is not much different than the way the American public stares blankly into cathode ray tubes for their daily dose of existence justification.  Yet the reality we submerse ourselves in is far from real, and I wouldn't be surprised if the execs at the five corporations that own us all, don't watch a minute of TV.The result of total emersion in the televisual reality of Videodrome, is death (ex. Brian Oblivion).  At least death in the real world.   We can be confused by how these cult leaders brain-washed normal everyday people, yet we don't realize that normal everyday people are themselves brain-washed, in their normality, which is invented by the society they accept as seen through their televisions.Cronenberg's eXistenZ is an equally ingenious discourse on video games and is recommend if you liked Videodrome.",Videodrome

Finally one day I decided to actually watch it. Wow. I had no idea it was so sexual! There were a few scenes in the movie where I had to turn away, it is kind of gross in some ways, like the scene where the Videodrome worker is on stage and Max shoots him and he falls to the ground and what looks like bloody guts or something start squirming out of him... It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through, and the special effects are awesome for the time period!

230,muppetstonight,Like everyone forgot your birthday.,1,14 February 2010,"Just watched this film with a friend, we were both left with that kind of grimy feeling, that feeling of an hour and a half of our lives wasted. Although, objectively I'd rate this film about a five, I gave it a 1 star review because the amount of ten star reviews here is ridiculous. Don't be fooled, it is not an excellent film, or anything close. The plot is confusing and contradictory, no not a clever paradox either, just purely bad. James Wood gives a passable performance, but there's no character development at all, you don't feel for him. Deborah Harry's character may as well have not existed. Every interesting direction the film could have gone, it didn't go. To say that this film was groundbreaking or ""way ahead of it's time"" is preposterous, the visual effects in it are nothing compared to Star Wars or Alien. The characters, I must stress, were less than vapid, SERIOUSLY, practically NOTHING is developed at all. There was a few (very few) nice shots in this film, but the story was terrible, the antagonist's motives aren't clear, it's not even clear what he wants to do. There's no ""trippy"" anything in this, it won't take you on a journey, it won't do anything but waste your time. This film is serious b movie material, if you want to watch some similar films check out the horror channel. Oh and seriously this film is not frightening AT ALL. I can't anything good out of it at all. That said, I would thoroughly recommend ""The Fly"", that is a great film, but if you're a fan of it, you won't get the same here. In summary, with the internet the film's message is laudable now, it wouldn't have been deep in the eighties either. This film will teach you nothing about life and the world, other than people do spend a lot of money to make rubbish films, and that people watch them and give raving reviews because they think it makes them ""deep"" to like films that others seemingly ""can't understand"". Basically, the cool film you imagine when reading the plot summary doesn't exist, maybe that's the message of Videodrome! =o =D.

First of all, this movie addresses society's issue such as the conceptually complex hyperreality and the relationship between sex and violence in a post-industrial, post-atomic, post-cold war, post-sexual revolution society. And my goodness, it does it such an extreme, in your face, over the top way that the message, even if you can't really express it, gets to you. It is an absurdists view on the new reality. Its more that just a movie ... and as a character points out in the film, ""It is a philosophy."" And yes, it is dangerous.You will turn this movie off with questions, and the kind of questions that all the pseudo-intellectuals, social theorists, and ""smart"" people can't answer - hell, half of them aren't even asking these questions yet.See it.
