0,MartinHafer,awfully insignificant and NOT a good film for the kids,5,1 June 2006,"This film totally unimpressed me and should be relegated to the category of ""time passers"". So, if it's coming on TV and you have absolutely NOTHING to do, then perhaps you should give it a try.My biggest complaint about the film is that although it appears to be marketed towards families, this really isn't a family-friendly film--especially for families with younger kids. There are two reasons I say this. The film, in spots, is pretty violent (such as Arnold beating up an abusive dad) and the language is ""problematic"" (such as the gratuitous use of he words ""penis"" and ""vagina""). For my kids, this isn't an issue--I have taught sex ed and we are not afraid to use these words--but for comedy? Plus, some parents might find themselves needing to have a talk to Jr. about these words if the kids haven't yet heard them! As for the plot itself, it's pretty trite and forgettable. Arnold the tough cop poses as a kindergarten teacher. Yeah, right! I'm glad actually the film didn't do better at the box office--imagine what spin-offs we might have seen! Arnold as an undercover stripper cop or lunch lady Arnold!",Kindergarten Cop
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Wasn't expecting it to work, but it did...",8,5 March 2011,"Kindergarten Cop was a surprisingly good film. I was not expecting it to work, and it worked so much better than I expected it to. Kindergarten Cop is a little overlong and the villains are perhaps a little too pantomime. However, the film does look lovely, and the score and soundtrack gives it its heart-warming sentiment.The script also worked. It was funny, it was poignant and it was well-meaning, while there is also a heart-warming story, good direction and pacing and the action while sometimes intense is well-handled.I was very surprised by the acting. Kindergarten Cop is not Arnold Schwarznegger's best film, but it does show that he can do comedy, and here he does do it well. He is suitably low-key and avoids being wooden as well. Penelope Ann Miller gives good support as well, and the chemistry between the two is convincing without taking over the film too much. The characters could have easily been stereotypical and unlikeable, but they aren't, instead they have a certain warmth to them, and this is including the kids.Overall, not a comedy classic, but it works far better than it should have done. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Kindergarten Cop
2,Leofwine_draca,A great turn from Schwarzenegger in a very different comedy,6,30 September 2014,"I'm not really a fan of Schwarzenegger's comedy films, given that I adore his action movies and would much rather be watching them instead. Stuff like TWINS tends to leave me cold, but I think it's fair to say that KINDERGARTEN COP is probably the best of his family-oriented flicks. The story, which sees Arnie's cop undercover in a school and saddled with a class of boisterous kids, almost writes itself.The reason that this is a workable film comes down to the script, which is laden with all of the classic one liners we know and love from the star. Schwarzenegger's interactions with his child co-stars are hilarious, and by throwing a ferret into the mix the producers round it out really. I also appreciated the film's efforts to explore the effect of broken homes upon kids, domestic violence and parental abuse.Elsewhere, it can be rather twee and overly sentimental at times, but nowhere near the level that Spielberg overdoes it. The action is very limited and infrequent, so much so as to be barely worth mentioning. Instead this is a film that rests on the (very) broad shoulders of its star, who acquits himself well as the likable hero who ends up completely out of his depth.",Kindergarten Cop
3,SnoopyStyle,two disparate tones too far apart,5,22 June 2015,"Police detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is tracking stone-cold killer Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson). He arrests him for murder. Detective Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) is assigned to be his partner. They track Cullen's ex Rachel (Penelope Ann Miller) to an Oregon kindergarten after she supposedly stole Cullen's millions and their son. O'Hara is sick and Kimble is pressed into undercover work as a substitute teacher looking for which mother is the former drug lord wife.The setup is a bit too dangerous. The basic premise is to get Arnold into a kindergarten class. That is actually a very funny premise. He is hilarious with the kids. The problem is that it's also a violent crime drama. There's no way to bridge the two disparate aspects of this movie. It works as a comedy as long as Arnold's with the kids and nobody remembers the cold blooded killers lurking out there. Once the movie touches anything serious, the movie grinds to a halt.",Kindergarten Cop
4,gavin6942,A Film That Ages Well,7,18 January 2015,"A tough cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is given his most difficult assignment ever: to masquerade as a kindergarten teacher in order to find a drug dealer.When this film first came out, it was panned by just about everyone besides Roger Ebert. Looking back 25 years later, Ebert was probably the only one who got it right. While not the greatest comedy, and certainly not a great action film, this movie has a certain charm that resonates beyond the typical demographic for Arnold's films.The only thing that really ages poorly is the bad guy's hair. But, to be fair, his hair was probably considered atrocious in 1990, too.",Kindergarten Cop
5,lee_eisenberg,Terminator meets Edna Purviance meets Baby Doll,5,3 December 2016,"Ivan Reitman's ""Kindergarten Cop"" delivers what it promises. I had actually seen the end of it on TV when I was little (starting where the kids learn never to talk to strangers). Now that I've seen the whole thing, I can affirm that it's an excuse for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be a tough guy and for the kindergartners to be silly. If you don't expect anything profound then you won't be disappointed.The reason why I watched it was because I read that Carroll Baker co-starred in it. I wanted to see what it was like for the woman known as Baby Doll (from Elia Kazan's film adaptation of Tennessee Williams's play) to co-star with the man known as the Terminator. She played the last kind of role that I would've expected someone like her to play. The other main cast member is Penelope Ann Miller, who's appeared in assorted movies over the years (Other People's Money, Chaplin, Carlito's Way, The Artist).Basically, the movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't.",Kindergarten Cop
6,jboothmillard,Kindergarten Cop,6,9 September 2005,"From director Ivan Reitman (Twins, Evolution), you might mistake this for a family film, and it is often shown in the middle of the day with violence and swearing cut out, it is shown very often in fact that I ignore it, but I do like it. Basically Detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a tough cop who has been trailing drug dealer Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) for years, but when he tracks him down, the only person besides the witness who can testify against him is his missing ex-wife. The only information Kimble has is the name of the school in Oregon her son attends, and when fellow detective Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed), who has teaching experience, falls sick, it is up to him to step in as an undercover kindergarten teacher to find the child in question. He tries a few techniques to identify the right child, but he is forced to also try to actually teach and look after the children, and he starts with a bad attitude and no skill or co-ordination at all. Slowly though the children are taken under his wing as Kimble teaches them discipline and to behave themselves when he tells or whistles them too, and meanwhile he is unaware that Crisp has been bailed out by his mother Eleanor (Carroll Baker) after the only witness is killed and can't testify. Eventually he determines that the boy in danger Dominic Palmieri (Joseph Cousins), and he has before finding this out started to gain feelings for his mother, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller), who finding out the truth about Kimble is terrified that the killer will be looking for them. Of course Crisp and Eleanor do track down Dominic, and he sets the school on fire in order to take the boy and try to kidnap him, but in the end the villain is killed, Kimble is injured, but he is happy to return to see the children of his class, and he and Joyce kiss. Also starring Linda Hunt as Miss Schlowski. Schwarzenegger just like in Twins proves that he can do comedy very well, this time of course it is his attitude and drill sergeant routine that gets the giggles, it is a simple story with both funny and thrilling moments, the small romantic stuff is okay, and the children ganging up on the muscle man are amusing, all combined adds to a likable and laughable action comedy film. Good!",Kindergarten Cop
7,ccthemovieman-1,"A Good Mix Of Humor & Action, But Unrealistic Look At Family",8,12 January 2007,"Here's an odd combination of humor, kids' cuteness, violence and suspense. The beginning, and the last third of the film provide the violence. In between is a nice story of a tough-guy cop becoming a loved and respected kindergarten teacher.The cuteness comes with the kids, who are nice and funny and with Penelope Miller's character. Miller sports wholesome looks and, except for the end when things get tense, a clean mouth.The star of the film, Arnold Schwarzenegger, shows a good flair for comedy as the tough guy-softie. This might be Arnold's most likable role. It was interesting to see Carroll Baker again, an actress I hadn't seen since the 1960s. I'd like to have seen her smile, but she frowned throughout her minor role in here.Storywise, this is typical Hollywood in that it depicts family life in a poor way. I know there are many single mothers out there today but in this movie - which is 17 years old - ALL of the kids in the class come from single homes except one, and that kid is being beaten up by this father! Excuse me - not one normal family out of 25?? Come on! Somebody should inform Hollywood there ARE happily married people in the United States....or at least outside the sick confines of Tinseltown.Anyway, the positives outweigh the negatives in the film and the unique mix of humor and suspense make this interesting for the full 111 minutes.",Kindergarten Cop
8,rmax304823,A Child's Garden Of Curses.,6,21 March 2016,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is a rough, dirty cop who is forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher in Astoria, Oregon, in pursuit of a mob witness.It sounds obscene, but not to despair. Arnold is his likable self, there are occasional outbursts of violence, Penelope Ann Miller has a dazzling smile, you don't get such an overdose of sentimentality that you feel you've been slimed, and it has its funny moments.A lot of the amusing stuff comes from the five-year olds, some of them disgustingly cute. But the funniest scenes of all come from Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to act. He's marvelous. He's blunt and forthright in his projections. If emotions like rage were a weight, he'd bench press them. When the anarchic kiddies are about to drive him nuts he explodes with anger and you ought to see it. His mandible juts forward, his lavender lips open in a tangled ""O"", and you can see every single one of his teeth, including his impacted molars, and they are all made of muscle not ivory. ""ARGHHH!,"" roars Arnold, giving it everything he's got.At the end, the erstwhile baffled body builder learns how to take pride in helping children and leaves his rough-hewn ways back in Los Angeles to join his new-found profession. How could it be otherwise? Some of the kids really ARE cute in their artless ways. They stumble while reciting their lines, fall over toy furniture, things like that.The whole thing works in the most commercial sense. Arnold is a businessman. He and I got along very well together on our unforgettable joint project, ""Raw Deal"" or whatever it was called. Yes, I'd say we resonated. I glanced at him and his cigar once or twice and he glanced at my T shirt (""Walker Museum, Minneapolis"") then ignored me completely. He and director Ivan Reitman are in synchrony. Neither wants to make a particularly good movie. They want to make money -- and they no doubt did.",Kindergarten Cop
9,Tweekums,An enjoyable blend of action and comedy as Arnie goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher,7,17 May 2018,"Los Angeles police officer John Kimble has been after drug lord Cullen Crisp for years and finally arrests him after he murders a man who told Crisp that he's seen his estranged wife. Apparently when she left she took their soon and three million dollars and now she is living in Astoria, Oregon. Kimble heads north with partner Phoebe O'Hara; it is planned that she, as a former teacher, will go undercover at the local school to identify Crisp's son and thus his ex-wife who they hope will testify... they have no idea of the boy's current name and there are no decent pictures of him or his mother. Unfortunately Phoebe gets ill so Kimble must play teacher... how hard can it be? He soon finds out that six year olds are much harder to deal with than criminals! He must figure out how to deal with the children while trying to identify Crisp's family. Inevitable before long Crisp is bailed and heads to Astoria looking for his son.One might think that because this is a comedy set in a kindergarten class it will be a family film suitable for all ages... it isn't. There are scenes of violence at the start and end as well as scenes of sustained threat to a child that are too intense for children. The sight of Arnie struggling with a class full of six-year olds is pretty funny; he does a fine job in the role. Pamela Reed also really impresses as his partner Phoebe. There are also notable performances from Linda Hunt as the school principal and Penelope Ann Miller as a fellow teacher who has a son at the school and provides a possible love interest for Kimble. The children of the class feel natural and provide many of the film's laughs. The identity of Crisp's wife and family aren't too obvious as there are a number of possibilities... that said when we do learn who they are it isn't a huge surprise. The early parts of the film, and its ending are the best; it did drag a little in the middle as Kimble gets control of her class. Overall I'd recommend this to Arnie's other films; just don't expect the action to be as full on as his earlier '80s films.",Kindergarten Cop
10,Quinoa1984,"""I'm a cop you idiot! I'm detective John Kimble!"" Ridiculous yet it is A-nuld",7,26 December 2000,"Kindergarden Cop is as dumb as films get, but it gets good in my book by Arnold's change in action to comedy (first seen in Twins).  Here, he plays a cop who is on the trail of a drug dealer, and the only way to go undercover is to become a teacher in little kids school, and then the laughs come as some classic Arnold clips (later played on O & A) come up like ""Stop Whining"" or ""You lack discipline.""  Not Ivan Reitman (or Scharzenegger's) finest hours, but it does give them changes of pace.  B+",Kindergarten Cop
11,edwagreen,Kindergarten Cop Goes to the Top of the Class ****,10,23 December 2006,"One of Arnold's best film roles ever. After seeing this, you might say to yourself that he could have stuck in out in films before becoming the governor of California.In this very funny film Arnold is forced to go under cover as a kindergarten teacher. He is actually looking for a drug dealer and believes that one of the kids in his class is the son of the guilty culprit.Naturally, he gets more than he beckoned for. There is romance with a female parent that brings unexpected results. Then, there is the matter of teaching. He is in a school with a maiden principal played memorably by Linda Hunt. She knows why he is there but expects him to be a 100% teacher at all times. How he maintains order and does teaching to the bargain is hilarious and simply rewarding to the teaching profession.A must see film for young and old. I guarantee that the school system was never like this.",Kindergarten Cop

13,hitchcockthelegend,It's his toughest assignment so far!,7,13 April 2010,"Kindergarten Cop is directed by Ivan Reitman and it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as John Kimble, a tough police detective who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to catch drug dealing baddie Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) before Crisp can get to his ex-wife and son. However, having no teaching experience previouslly, Kimble finds the children a right handful. Not only that but he finds himself attracted to another teacher, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) to further complicate things.Sandwiched in between ""Total Recall"" and ""Terminator 2:Judgement Day"", is this light action comedy on Arnold Schwarzenegger's Curriculum Vitae. With a salary of $12 million in his pocket the big Austrian revels in playing comedy. Much as he did with ""Twins"" from 1988, Schwarzenegger is comfortable in making himself the butt of the jokes. With a crazy premise such as this one it was imperative that he got the feel of the comedy right, something that he achieves in spades.Schwarzenegger's play off with all the children is good fun cinema, even tender at times. For in amongst the froth the writers still slot in serious issues, issues that Schwarzenegger, in spite of his obvious lack of acting gravitas, grasps with two gigantic hands. There's no surprises in store within the plot, and I'm pretty sure for a film of this type nobody is seriously expecting any. Yet the good honest fun makes this one for all the family to enjoy.With good support from Miller & Reed, and of course the army of sprightly children, Schwarzenegger once again doesn't take himself seriously. Hollywood, like it or not, is all the better for it. 6.5/10",Kindergarten Cop
14,preppy-3,Has its moments but too long and violent,6,12 October 2008,"Detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is trying to convict vicious criminal Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson). Crisp is after his ex wife Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) who left him and took their kid Dominic. Kimble and partner Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) search for her before Crisp and his equally vicious mom (Caroll Baker) find her. It ends up with Kimble acting as a kindergarten teacher trying to discover which kid in the class is Dominic.The idea of Arnie being a teacher with a bunch of kids is not a bad one. There are some real cute bits with him trying to deal with them and the kids are adorable. Reed is very funny as his partner (the part where she pretends to be his sister broke me up). It's great to see Linda Hunt playing the principal of the school and it was shot in Oregon and looks beautiful. Still I didn't really like this. It's far too long and they throw in a really unnecessary romance between Arnie and Miller. Also Baker and Miller are lousy and the wonderful Cathy Moriarty is given nothing to do. And, despite all the kids in the cast, this is not a film for children. A man is casually shot dead in the first 5 minutes and the last half hour gets very bloody and violent--way too much for a PG-13 film. Even worse they throw in a child abuse subplot. Arnie realizes a child in his class is being beaten. His solution? Punch the father out and threaten to press charges. Then...it's never addressed again. If you're going to throw in such serious subjects in a purported comedy you should at least try to come up with a resolution and not just ignore it. So the violence and length kept me from enjoying this. I can only give it a 6.",Kindergarten Cop
15,view_and_review,"Edgy, Funny, Romantic, Cute",7,30 December 2018,"A neat blend of rom-com, cop movie, and feel good story-Arnold Schwarzenegger goes for the trifecta in this classic. This gruff, violent, no-holds-barred cop named John Kimble has to transform his physical image and his personality in order to find the wife of a known drug dealer. His pursuit leads him to a kindergarten class in Astoria, Oregon where the tough and scary gives way to the cute and cuddly.Not that this could have really happened it still made for a fun and sometimes funny movie. The kids were the real comedy because I've never found Schwarzenegger really funny. The movie ranged from edgy, to funny, to romantic, to cute and it displayed each adequately.",Kindergarten Cop
16,FlashCallahan,I'm the party pooper.....,7,13 February 2013,"John Kimble is a tough city cop who's been on the trail of drug dealer Cullen Crisp for years. He finally tracks Crisp down but it seems the only person that can testify against him is his ex-wife. The problem is she's disappeared and all Kimble knows is the name of the school in Oregon where her son attends. When things don't quite go to plan, Kimble finds he has to go undercover on his toughest assignment yet, a kindergarten teacher.....It's a no brainier really, the biggest action star in the world, the toughest character in the film, has to look after little kids. Oh and it works in so many ways.Reitmans biggest draw is making the first twenty minutes a proper action movie, here we have Arnold at his most recognisable, tough, spouting out one liners and not giving a hoot about anyone. Then after a bout of food poisoning, that Arnold is still there, but he has a class of little children to attend with, and this is the main draw, children saying a lot of old cobblers, sometimes innuendo, and then watching Arnold lose his temper.That's the film. The whole sub-plot involving the drug dealer is just filler to join the dots.The cast are great, it has a real feel-good vibe to it, and the chemistry between the star and the children is spot on.It's a shame Reitman didn't hit a turkey with Junior, but this is easily Arnold's best venture out of action movies, and it shows he has got good comic timing.Well worth seeing.",Kindergarten Cop

They figure they have where the child might be so Arnold's partner who used to be a schoolteacher is going to infiltrate the class and find out who the kid is.

18,SimonJack,"Good comedy, crime, romance flick filmed in Astoria",6,19 October 2021,"""Kindergarten Cop"" was a funny movie when first seen in the theater, and it's still amusing three decades later. As a comedy, it doesn't have a screenplay with witty dialog or a funny script. Rather, it's a cute story with humorous situations. The crime element is a little rough. Mostly, the story is a little silly, but warm, with some humorous situations involving two of the leads.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pamela Reed are the undercover cops, Kimble and Phoebe, who set up residence in an Astoria, Oregon, motel. The humor revolves mostly around them. Linda Hunt is very good as the Astoria elementary school principal, Miss Schlowski. Kimble finally wins her approval as a kindergarten teacher when he confronts a dad who comes to the school to pick up his boy. The boy had shown bruises from child abuse. Kimble walks over to the line of waiting cars after school, talks to the dad and punches him in the face. As I recall, most of us in the audience at the time felt as Miss Schlowski did.It's too bad they didn't show a little more of the scenery there. The Astoria-Megler Bridge across the mouth of the Columbia River is 4.1-miles long. The school where the movie was filmed sits high on the slope that climbs the southern bluff above the river. The view in the film just shows a snippet of the expanse of scenery.I saw this film while living in Portland, Oregon. I had a retired Navy cousin who lived near Astoria, and I had been there several times. The town was named after John Jacob Astor, of the Astoria Hotel fame in New York. He was a big business magnate during the early years of America's westward expansion. Astor's company set up the first settlement there in 1811. That's after Robert Gray discovered the mouth of the Columbia River and was the first to sail up the river in 1792; and after the Lewis and Clark Expedition made its way to the ocean near there over land in 1804-1805.",Kindergarten Cop

He goes from perp-busting to completely out of his depth in a classroom full of kids . . . And it feels like a natural move; nothing forced about it. Credit here to Ivan Reitman who knows what he's doing, but also to Arnold's chemistry with the tiny terrors; it is charming as hell. The surprise here is Pamela Reed, who holds her own as the staryu's unlikely partner, and has some of the script's best lines.This is a heartfelt comedy with appeal for young and old alike; an expert use of a movie star's towering stature.",Kindergarten Cop

It had non stop laughs and heart warming moments. Arnold was so enjoyable to watch, him going crazy was just too funny.

However this involves being in the school of the criminal's son! The laughs are a cry out, remember the line it's not a tumor!

23,Red-Barracuda,Should be really bad but is actually really good,7,14 August 2017,"Arnold Schwarzenegger hooks up with director Ivan Reitman once again, after their 80's smash hit Twins (1988) first highlighted the giant Austrian's talent for comedy. Like that one, this is a film that is so high-concept that you should be able to work out a large part of the plot just by looking at the poster. The film does one of those things that lots of comedies from the late 80's / early 90's did and that is set up a light-hearted comedy framework and then throw in a crime sub-plot into the mix. To this end we have Arnold playing a disillusioned cop who is trying to hunt down that other staple of the era – the criminal with a sharp suit and power ballad haircut. Arnie travels to a small town in Oregon where he knows that Power Ballad's ex-wife and son live. In order to find them he goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher. Needless to say, this unlikely primary school teacher gets into a series of toddler-related japes, while falling in love with Power Ballad's ex-wife who also works at the school. Before long things turn nasty when Power Ballad turns up and tries to steal his son back leaving Arnie with no alternative but to deal with this pony-tailed, suited-and-booted ponce.This one shouldn't work but it does. Its story is almost charmingly moronic but it gets by on account of a highly likable and often somewhat hilarious performance from Schwarzenegger, who really can play comedy really well. He is ably supported by Pamela Reed who plays his partner who at one stage hilariously pretends to be his sister replete with amusing Austrian accent and Germanic gestures. Then of course there are the little kids themselves who are often very funny and who Arnie works extremely well with and has great chemistry. The result is a movie which transcends its paper thin basic idea and results in a genuinely charming chuckle-fest.",Kindergarten Cop

25,OllieSuave-007,My Favorite Schwarzenegger Movie!,10,19 October 2013,"This is my all-time favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie, a story about Arnold's character, John Kimble, going undercover as a kindergarten teacher to track down the ex-wife of suspected drug-dealer Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) so she could testify against him.The movie starts out with some gun-totting action with some classic and typical Arnold humor. It then takes you inside the classroom full of rowdy five and six year-old kids, where Kimble hopes to find Crisp's son. Kimble finds that being a kindergarten teacher is more challenging then dealing with drug dealers and junkies, so he hatches up a plan to get his class in order. What follows is a touching plot showing Arnold's more light-hearted and comedic side.Kindergarten Cop has a fast-paced plot and fun story, mixing just the right dose of action, drama and comedy together - no over-the-top stuff. I love the subplot of Kimble dealing with a troubled kid and establishing a relationship with Crisp's ex-wife and son - great chemistry! All the actors who portrayed the kindergarten students in the movie were great, each one giving his/her unique and hilarious background (i.e., one is a loner, one likes to talk about death and diseases, one likes to eat other kids' food, etc.). And, the kids don't give the impression that this is a children's-only movie with childish acting; it's great for all audiences! In addition, actresses Penelope Ann Miller (Joyce Palmieri), Pamela Reed (Det. O'Hara) and Linda Hunt (Principal Schlowski) were excellent in their respective roles.This is one of those movies I would watch again and again, a winner for action and comedy movie lovers!

26,thesar-2,"He's not a princess, nor does he have a tumor",8,14 June 2015,"I was just a kid myself, well, 16, when I first saw this total gem. I thought it was cute, adventurous and hilarious. 25 years later, it still holds up as one of Arnold's best and even as a comedy, it contains some memorable lines. So memorable, in fact, if just merely mentioned in conversation decades later, people would instantly recognize the reference. I love Arnold's action pics from both the 80s and beyond this into the 90s, but, by far, this is one of his best performances to date and best comedy. In truth, this movie shouldn't have worked. It had all the clichés and predictability stacked against it, even in 1990. But, Director Ivan Reitman sure did know how to tie everything in, even for a kids movie really only made for adults. Totally recommended, even if you've seen it before.* * *Final thoughts: I just heard, coincidentally following my much needed and delayed purchase of the BluRay that they decided to remake this. Bah! Really? What needs to be improved on? Do they need to update this and the police's tactic to 2015 or 2016? Nope. But, if they must, and they make the final call, sadly, they MUST include the three most famous and quotable lines:""Boys have a penis, and girls have a vagina.""""I'm not a policeman, I'm a princess!""""It's not a tumor!""",Kindergarten Cop
27,bensonmum2,"""I'm a cop, you idiot! I'm Detective John Kimble!""",7,16 December 2017,"John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop assigned to put a killer named Crisp behind bars for good. To do so, Kimble needs to find Crisp's son and ex-wife. All he knows for certain is the name of the small Oregon town where the live and that the boy is kindergarten age. Kimble goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to try to find the boy. Even though he's a tough cop on a mission, Kimble realizes, to his amazement, that he enjoys teaching the kids. He also finds a love interest in one of the other teachers, Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) - a single mother whose son is in Kimble's class. And, as luck would have it, Kimble discovers that Joyce is Crisp's ex-wife. How convenient! Kimble will have to act fact, though, because Crisp is on his way to collect his son.For the most part, Kindergarten Cop is an enjoyable movie. Schwarzenegger seems naturally unnatural around the kids, but that works in the film's favor. Kimble should be awkward around his class. There are a number of humorous interactions between the un-humorous Kimble and the kids - my favorite being his reaction to the kid obsessed with death. Good stuff. As awkward as Schwarzenegger is around the children, it's the exact opposite when it comes to his co-star, Miller. There's a nice chemistry between the two that really shows on-screen. I would have loved to see the pair make more movies together. Another plus for kindergarten cop is Pamela Reed playing Kimble's partner. Reed is always good and gives a solid performance here. Throw in some nice action toward the film's conclusion and Kindergarten Cop ends up being a nice experience.I do, however, have two complaints. First, the film is too long. I really think that if just 10 to 15 minutes were cut from the runtime, it would be a better, tighter movie. Cut the scenes with Cathy Moriarty, for example. They add zilch to the final product. Second, baddie Crisp and his mother aren't threatening enough. They're jokes. Had the pair been played with a more menacing tone, the final showdown would have been even better. Still, it's a solid film as is.",Kindergarten Cop
28,FeastMode,my notes,4,27 July 2019,"Decently made movie with likable characters. and the funny parts cracked me up a few times, especially with the kids. but half of the movie was serious or emotional. and those parts were un-good. very outdated with some hilarious cliche shots along with cheesy music. like a zoom in on a shocked face when something crazy happens. i was enjoying it a lot for a while, but it became to child-y feel-good-y emotion-y (about 3 viewings)",Kindergarten Cop
29,Robert_duder,A stone cold classic that makes Arnold the star that he is,9,15 January 2009,"If nothing else Kindergarten Cop is one of the best action comedies of all time. It holds its own in classic movies and its the type of thing you could watch again and again. Many have different opinions of former Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger and how he became the star he is/was. If you watch Kindergarten Cop it should explain everything. After a decade of adrenaline pumping action and one attempt at comedy (Twins) he combined the two to make a fun, wonderfully plotted, and brilliantly directed film that is a classic. Following the recipe of a great comedy you have hilarious kids and some of the funniest most adorable moments, and you have a muscle bound, awkward action star trying to make these kids follow him as a Kindergarten teacher...hilarity truly does follow. The action side of the film is intense and thrilling enough to really keep it moving but the heart of the film is really the kids and the star interacting making some of the most memorable moments and lines from any eighties (very late eighties) movies. ""Are these your lunches?"" ""It's not a tuma, it's not."" ""Boys have a penis, girls have a vagina,"" and so many more.Arnold Schwarzenegger is actually one of my favorite actors. He has earned his action status and I happen to think he does have some range as an actor however slim it may be but he really turns it up as hard edged Detective John Kimble. When the film begins he looks and acts just like one of his action hero rolls. Everything changes when he has to take on the role of the teacher. The fish out of water story has never been so funny and he pulls it off flawlessly and with an insane amount of heart on his part. Pamela Reed is just amazing as Schwarzenegger's partner. They have terrific chemistry as partners and she is hilariously funny and tough as nails. I would have loved to have seen them team up again after this film. Penelope Ann Miller is the object of their protection Joyce. She is lovely and somehow her and Schwarzenegger make the perfect couple. She isn't the best character in the movie but she does well. Richard Tyson and Carroll Baker are absolutely brilliant villains in the film. Tyson is twisted and disturbing and Baker really is a fun but scary villain. I wish I could go into details and list every kid in the movie because they are all truly terrific and all have their moments and lines that make this a classic. No kid should be overlooked in this film because they are all my favorite at different times.Eighties movie master Ivan Reitman helms Kindergarten Cop. He does such a great job of balancing the action and thrills against true slapstick comedy. That is perhaps one of Kindergarten Cop's crowning achievements being both a full on action thriller and a slapstick roll in the aisles comedy. If you haven't seen Kindergarten Cop...while I'm surprised given its popularity over the last 15 years but everyone should see this because it is truly an astonishing, fun, and just all around great film. One of my all time favorites to be sure. 9/10",Kindergarten Cop
30,bowmanblue,"It shouldn't work, but it does",8,8 September 2014,"Granted Kindergarten Cop stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, but, apart from that, I sometimes wonder how this film got made. It has a healthy dose of 'typical Arnie butt-kicking,' plus a load of cute kids, a child abuse sub-plot, creepy child abductors, romantic comedy element and a kooky police partner (expertly played by Pamela Reed).Big Arnie is a tough cop (no change there then) who has to go undercover in a class fill of five year olds in order to try and find out which child is being hunted by a mobster. All in all, it should be a mess. The film-makers have thrown in so many elements that it must turn out to be a stinker and yet somehow, it turns out to be a classic.The film covers so many areas and succeeds in every one. It's hard to know who its target audience is, but I would probably say anyone from teenage upwards. Even though it's a film about children, it does tend to exclude the younger audiences from watching it, as some of the scenes might be a little upsetting for youngsters.Apart from that, I'd say that most people over the age of about twelve should be able to get some sort of enjoyment from one of Arnie's slightly more surreal performances.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Kindergarten Cop

But, I enjoyed this film a lot.This is about a police officer who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to catch a criminal and ultimately fall for the first grade teacher.The acting is actually pretty good here. The only person that is well-known is Arnold. Everyone else are just small-role actors but they were decent. I can't see why people say Arnold is wooden.

33,inkblot11,"All I learned from Kindergarten Cop was positive, a fine film, too violent for the kindergarten set, however",8,31 October 2012,"Los Angeles Detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has been trying to catch drug kingpin Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) for many months. One day, at the mall, Crisp learns important information about his son from Danny, but the thanks Dann-o gets is two lethal bullets from a gun with a silencer. Kimble, also trailing Crisp, finds a witness named Cindy who can confirm Crisp bumped off Danny. Catching Crisp soon after at a hair salon where Crisp's Bloody Mama (Carroll Baker) is under a stylist's care, John K halls CC off to jail. But, since Cindy is a druggie, her testimony may not be enough. Most importantly, Crisp has been searching for his son for five years, ever since the mother took the little boy into hiding. Now, thanks to Cindy, the police know where the two are residing. With CC still in jail, John and his new partner, Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) head to Astoria, Oregon to see if they can find the missing mother and child. Phoebe is to be the new Kindergarten teacher, because the little boy is that age, and John is supposed to act like her husband. There are no current photos of either mom or little lad. However, Phoebe gets very ill on the eve of her first day and can't do it. So, Kimble poses as the new teacher! Principal Lebowski (Linda Hunt) is not impressed, at first, because Kimble does an extremely poor job his first day. However, John does meet fellow teacher Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller) who gives him a hand and her young son Dominic is in Kimble's class, too. Soon, there may be a romance brewing between these two, J and J. But, when news comes that Cindy has died from an overdose and Crisp and his ruthless mommy are on the way to Oregon, Kimble and O'Hara frantically try to discover which ones of their new fellow citizens are the folks they want to protect. Will they make it? This is very fine and fun film, one of Arnold's best. He is quite entertaining as the put-upon teacher, who learns a lot in a little bit of time. The rest of the cast, Miller, Tyson, Reed, Hunt, and especially the tough-as-nails Baker, are very nice, too. Then, the Oregon setting is so gorgeous, everyone will want to trek there to see the beauty for themselves. Moreover, the costumes, photography, script and well-paced direction are all contributors to a winning film. One should mention, slightly, that there is too much violence for any children to view. But, in truth, all you need to know about this Kindergarten Cop is that a great movie for a great night ""in"".",Kindergarten Cop
34,vincentlynch-moonoi,Decent film before Arnold started taking himself too seriously,7,31 July 2013,"The reason I like this film is because it's Arnold before he became a politician...hence before he began taking himself too seriously. He never was a great actor, but in certain kinds of roles he could do pretty well in terms of entertaining us. A couple of other times he took a risk of doing a comedy film (comedy is always harder than drama), and it turned out okay...and this is one of those times.The plot is cool -- a cop (Arnold) is after a drug dealer who is abusive toward his ex-wife and who wants his young son. The mother and boy flee to Astoria, Oregon, where she is teaching in a school. Arnold becomes a temporary kindergarten teacher. Much of the film is about Arnold trying to get the kids under control, and I must say the kids do pretty well here. Ultimately Arnold wins them over, and Arnold falls in love with the ex-wife of the drug dealer. Obviously, the drug dealer shows up near the end of the movie, there's a shoot-out, and...The key roles here, aside from Arnold, are Penelope Ann Miller as the drug dealer's ex-wife, who does very well in this part. Pamela Reed is funny as Arnold's partner who spends half the film with food poisoning, but comes through in the clinch. Linda Hunt is neat as the school's principal. Richard Tyson is genuinely menacing as the drug dealer. And was I surprised when the credits rolled and I saw that the drug dealer's mother was Carroll Baker.This is a decent film with some good laughs, some fine action in the beginning and at the end, and it has a heart. Recommended.",Kindergarten Cop
35,The-Sarkologist,Arnie Begins to explore the Comic,6,31 May 2013,"My favourite part of this movie is when Arnie raids the illegal nightclub. It is just one long line of cool scenes and comments. Like he gets out of the car, thumps two thugs, turns around to the gangers admiring his car and pumps his shotgun and say, ""I forgot to introduce myself, my name is John Kimbal and I like my car,"" to which the ganger replies, ""hey, I was just looking after it."" and when Kimbal turns and walks away the guys says, ""who does he think he is? I'll whip his butt!"" I could go on but this is not the purpose. It is more to examine the movie as a piece of literature, in a brief overview, and criticise it as such. I don't like to refer to this as a review, though it does come down to it in a lot of cases. Much of the content of movies is similar, and as such I will try to raise such ideas, and this is what I will do with Kindergarten Cop.John Kimbal (Arnold Swarztenegger) is a detective that has been chasing a drug dealer, Crisp, for most of his career. His obsession with Crisp has led him to loose his wife and access to his son. He has become anti-social and lost contact with the world around him. He is a cop and is good at what he does. What happens though is that Crisp murders somebody and he arrests him for it, but the witness is little more than a junkie and her evidence will be shaky in court. Instead he learns of the location of Crisp's ex-wife and must find her. To do that involves entering a school to find her son. The cop that was to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher falls sick and cannot do it, and Kimbal takes her place. He is used to dealing with junkies and murderers, but he is not used to dealing with 6 year old kids.There are two major themes which come out of this movie: the ideal verses the reality, and divorce and marriage. The movie seems to draw us into a beautiful ideal world. We begin in Los Angeles where it is a haven of drugs and murderers, and this hell hole of crime and corruption is contrasted with the town in Oregon which is idyllic. When Crisp arrives he says, ""fresh air, can't wait to return to the city."" Which creates the really sinister side of him. Kimbal, who is used to the city and is apart of it though, becomes transformed by the idyllic setting of the town. It is a town of single mothers, usually from divorce, and thus Reitman has created a world where people flee to to escape the horrors of the city. Even so, we are confronted with reality, such as Crisp and the child basher. The idyllic setting of the town draws us away from the real reason why Kimbal is in the town, and that is to find Crisp's ex-wife so that she can testify against him. Yet our idyllic feel about the town is shattered, first in a dream when Crisp arrives at the window and shoots at Kimbal, and secondly when Crisp arrives and begins a reign of violence.This seems to try to mirror life, where our idyllic surroundings, if we are surrounded by such settings, are often shattered by the pain and misery of this world. We generally try to hide from the truth of this cursed world by creating a false perception that everything is all right. We look at the 1920's when everything was booming and we thought that it would go on forever, then October 29, 1929, the stock market crashed and brought the world into one of the biggest depressions that it had experienced. We need to keep alert and remember that this world isn't all that there is. We must remember that anything could happen and that the idyllic never remains.The second theme, which is subservient to the major theme of the ideal verses reality, is that of marriage and divorce. It is interesting how proliferate divorce plays in this movie. Kimbal has been divorced because he was more interested in his work than his marriage, Crisp is divorced because he is a criminal and his wife did not want anything to do with him. Kimbal's partner, Pheobe, is not divorced, but rather engaged to be married. What we have thus is hope after suffering. We see around this ideal town the scars of society -- divorce, death, crime, and child bashing. But among this pain is hope, a hope symbolised in the romance between Kimbal and Crisp's ex-wife, and a hope shown within Pheobe's relationship.Beyond this though, Kindergarten Cop is an enjoyable movie. It is one that seems to tackle some interesting themes, and through all of the pain and deception that flows through it, the movie focuses much more on the hope of rebirth and the renewal of relationships. Relationships were broken and in Kindergarten cop, they are not repaired, but new ones begin.",Kindergarten Cop

Lol In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie tells how he waited for a year to make this with Ivan Reitman (who was busy with Ghostbusters 2) and how he insisted that the script be rewrote to include broken homes, child abuse and he also wanted a physical fitness theme added too, as he was heavily involved in The Presidents Council On Physical Fitness at the time (which also explains his cameo in 1993's Kevin Klein movie Dave)The 10th highest grossing movie of 1990 with a gods of $91 million at the domestic box office.

There are so many good and cool things about the movie! It has a tremendous cast and is directed by Ivan Reitman who directed two of the greatest movies ever made which is Ghostbusters 1 & 2 and also another very good film with Arnold called Twins! The music is by Randy Edelman which this score is one of his best! Now about the cast! They are all great in the film which Arnold is great but one of my other favorite actors Richard Tyson really steals the show here! His character is a mean one and out of all of the villains in Arnold's movies I think Tyson's character is the most menacing. The other cast was good and they include Penelope Ann Miller, Pamela Reed, Linda Hunt, Carroll Baker, Richard Portnow, Chi Moui Lo, Leo Lee, & Thomas Rosales Jr. and even Angela Bassett! Anyway the movie is funny especially the kids but its a serious and very exciting movie! I just adore the beginning of it and when Arnold parks his car and shoots up every thing! In My opinion that's one of the greatest scenes ever! This movie is special and is just not one of Arnold's best but one of the best movies around! I strongly recommend everyone to watch it!Movie Nuttball's NOTE:Is this a strange coincidence? Penelope Ann Miller, Linda Hunt, and Chi Moui Lo were not only in this movie together but they were also together in the awesome horror movie The Relic! Its also strange that there was also school scenes in the monster flick very reminiscent of the ones seen in Kindergarten Cop! I just thought I would point that out! By the way, if you love horror, check out the Relic! Its one of the best creature movies and I strongly recommend it!I also strongly recommend these Arnold movies if you love the muscular actor turned Governor!

He has to completely change his manners and attitude to fit on his new role if he wants to succeed.I found this movie very funny and interesting due to the interpretation of Arnold Schwarzenegger who played as Kimble. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Penelope Ann Miller's who played as Joyce and she was very good. The direction which was made by Ivan Reitman, it was also good and he combined very well action with some family moments.

41,zkonedog,Maybe Arnold's Best Overall Work,9,5 March 2017,"When people think back on the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, they will most likely strike upon his ""Terminator"" role, his portrayal of musclebound ""Conan the Barbarian"", and his penchant for shoot-em-up 1980's action flicks. However, ""Kindergarten Cop"" gives Arnold perhaps his most complete vehicle for showcasing all sides of his acting talent.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees undercover cop John Kimble (Arnold) become a kindergarten teacher in order to scope out baddie Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson). While teaching (or trying to, anyway!), he completely falls for a fellow teacher (Penelope Ann Miller) and forms a strong bond with her son (Joseph/Christian Cullins).What makes this movie such a classic effort is that it is so multi-dimensional. Included are...-A typical gun-toting Arnie taking the law into his own hands. -Some hilarious comedy that will have you laughing out loud on numerous occasions. -Rich, developed characters that help suck you into the well-constructed plot. -A light, more romantic side of Arnold.All these different scenarios, mixed together perfectly by director Ivan Reitman, create a film in which every scene offers something to behold. Watching Mr. Kimble struggle with his new young charges is hilarious, while scenes towards the end of the flick will have you on the edge of your seat and perhaps even in real suspense.Overall, then, I consider ""K-Cop"" to be perhaps the most well-rounded performance of Schwarzenegger's career...and just a darn good movie to boot! Though some scenes will be too graphic or inappropriate for the real young kiddies, this is also a film that can be enjoyed by the whole family...again, because it offers so many different genres.",Kindergarten Cop

44,Vartiainen,Surprisingly decent,6,14 July 2012,"Schwarzenegger's comedic movies are always regarded as something of a joke, and for a good reason. They're usually completely over the top, stupidly inconsistent and usually the only good thing about them is the main actor himself, because, well... it's Arnold Schwarzenegger. How could you not love that hulking giant of badass entertainment. The man has a heart of gold and yet is still one of the biggest badasses out there. Nevertheless, I think that this singular film might be the only comedy from him that's actually decent as a standalone film and not just because he's in it. Is it a great comedy? Well, not really, it's about average, but it has some great lines of dialogue and the premise itself is pretty cool. I mean, who wouldn't want Schwarzenegger as his or her kindergarten teacher. And the movie recognizes this fact, giving him plenty of scenes where he just interacts with the kids and completely charms them with his sheer presence. And it's actually kind of surprising just how well the man can act. Usually his acting is kind of one-dimensional, which for his action movies is more than enough, but in this film he has some real depth and variety. The man is no Marlon Brando or Humphrey Bogart, but he is capable of giving a solid performance, apparently.And the rest of the film isn't bad either. The supporting characters are entertaining in their own ways, the villain is decent and the plot, while not that original, allows for some very nice scenes and plot devices.So yeah, as a whole this movie is average, nothing less, nothing more, but it has some really great one-liners and characters. Definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of either Schwarzenegger or lighthearted comedy.",Kindergarten Cop

47,drqshadow-reviews,Arnold and Kids Make the Most of a Bland Script,5,24 March 2021,"The title really says it all here. Arnold gets silly as a tough guy cop, undercover in the classroom, who finds his young students twice as terrifying as the pimps and addicts he normally wrangles.Following closely after Twins, his first lighter role, this represents a further softening of the Governator's image and a broadening of his popular appeal. He still gets to fire big guns, wear intimidating sunglasses, toss chumps around the room - actually, he probably does too much of that stuff - but he also reveals an unexpected gentle side and an effective, self-aware sense of humor. Sure, many of the laughs revolve around how the big guy speaks (anyone who was around in far-off year of 1990 has probably barked ""It's not a toomah"" in a bad Austrian accent once or twice) but it never comes off as mean-spirited or in poor taste and Schwarzenegger really leans into the stereotype for maximum absurdity points.Arnold's great with the kids, too, and under the improv-friendly gaze of director Ivan Reitman, they more than hold up their end of the bargain. The best bits are where the youngsters go off-script and ramble, or climb all over the action hero like a jungle gym, or go silent and simply goggle at his reactions. Those moments give the film more staying power than its paper-thin plot really deserves. Granted, it leaves plenty of space for on-set serendipity, but it also takes forever to get started and fails to settle on an appropriate tone. Was this premise really calling for a bullet-riddled climax in the school bathroom?",Kindergarten Cop

It is an entertaining movie that shows that Schwartsenegger was capable of lighter feel good films as well as action.The school scenes are excellent and everything that happens in the classroom is plausible. Having worked in this type of setting in the past I had empathy for the character. Arnie has great screen chemistry with the children and these scenes are what makes the movie work.There are parts of it that drag for me, such as the romantic scenes and certain parts where he reverts to policeman/action hero, but these aren't done badly, just a matter of personal taste.One of the better of the more serious scenes is where Arnie deals with a child from an abusive family and confronts the parents. You can't help but cheer him on in this sequence.There are some great supporting performances, particularly Pamela Reed who is charming and charismatic as the partner.My four year old daughter enjoyed it, but I skipped through some of the more violent parts.

Schwarzenegger gives a fun performance as Richard Kimble the undercover cop pretending to be a kindergarten teacher & it's so much fun with cool quotable lines & a beautiful music score, excellently directed by REITMAN make this old school cop comedy Thriller a true classic!!! Won't need to talk about the plot or story as everyone knows it!!!!
Just a great fun family film with some comedy,drama & action but mixed together perfectly by director ivan reitman & a great performance by Schwarzenegger, a childhood CLASSIC that I've watched hundreds of times, it's so much fun.
Kindergarten Cop truly is one of Schwarzenegger's best loved films as many of us grew up watching it & loving it, Schwarzenegger's performance is also great here as Kimble & shows how fun he could be as well as do the Action stuff & here his toned down performance is actually touching & sweet. The king of Action is truly a Childhood hero of mine & Kindergarten Cop is one of my most watched Schwarzenegger films.Director Ivan reitman makes such great,sweet,funny,feelgood,touching & pure escapism films that you can put on & cheer yourself up, his comedies touch our hearts & make us smile, thank you Reitman for making my childhood great as i grew up watching & loving ""Ghostbusters 1&2"" & ""Kindergarten Cop"" & ""Twins"" & ""Junior"" well my all time favourite movie ever is his excellent underrated Sequel ""Ghostbusters 2"" that Reitman is a great Director & knows how to get the best feelgood comic genius performances out of his actors, especially ""Schwarzenegger"" ""Aykroyd"" ""Murray"" & ""Devito"" i love his movies.",Kindergarten Cop
50,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent movie about what it's like to go undercover when you're a cop,9,8 August 2006,"KINDERGARTEN COP, in my opinion, is an excellent movie about what it's like to go undercover when you're a cop. If you ask me, the way that Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Joyce/Rachel (Penelope Ann Miller) fell in love was absolutely romantic. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent movie about what it's like to go undercover when you're a cop. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",Kindergarten Cop

52,gcd70,Funny and entertaining,7,14 May 2007,"Very entertaining film about a cop who must go undercover as a kindergarten teacher in order to track down a killer.Director Ivan Reitman, who delivers his best film since ""Ghostbusters"", uses Arnold Schwarzenegger brilliantly in this unusual role. Penelope Ann Miller, Pamela Reed and Linda Hunt lend good support. This is an original movie that, although not full of surprises, keeps the drama and comedy perfectly balanced.The children, who are, to Reitman's credit, not used purely to influence the emotions, are adorable and hilarious in a film that is definitely worth your while.Friday, April 12, 1991 - Knox District Centre Sunday, May 12, 1991 - Greater Union Melbourne""Kindergarten Cop"" is still entertaining even the third time.

53,dworldeater,Watchable Schwarzenegger/Reitman family comedy collaboration,6,11 August 2015,"Arnie goes deep, deep, deep undercover in his second comedy collaboration with director Ivan Reitman. Although it does not hold up as well as some of his other work and is not nearly as good or as funny as Twins, Kindergarden Cop is still alright. Only Arnold Schwarzenegger could pull off playing a cop that goes undercover as a kindergarden teacher. Comic genius Ivan Reitman and man of action Arnold Schwarzenegger somehow make this ridiculous premise work, delivering the goods for some very wholesome and very cheesy family entertainment. While this film is not among my favorite titles in Mr. Schwarzenegger's filmography, it is one that I at least find to be watchable. Arnie's buddy Sly saw his success in the comedy realm and followed suite(and failed miserably) with such ""great"" movies like Oscar and Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot. By comparison Kindergarden Cop is much better and it also managed to make a lot of money and gained a lot of fans.",Kindergarten Cop
54,Movie-ManDan,"Although It Is Fun and Light-Hearted, Take Caution To It.",7,3 March 2017,"Kindergarten Cop has always been a movie best left on TV. It is not good enough to spend money on, but I'm not going to tell you to skip it. But it is definitely worth watching. This is one of the binds that the movie finds itself in.In one of Arnie's best roles he plays his usual macho self with a hard edge who is any criminal's worst nightmare. The best part about him playing these roles is that he knows exactly how to play them so that the audience can have fun but still take him seriously. His name is detective John Kimble and he is pretty similar to Stallone in Cobra. But Kimble and Kindergarten Cop are both better. (In my opinion at least)Kimble has been hot on the trail of drug dealer Cullen Crisp and Kimble's greatness as a cop is finally bringing that case into a close. Crisp is a typical 90's bad who has long hair, wears a suit, looks innocent, and is always strapped. The only bit that could put Crisp away for good is the testimony of his ex-wife Rachel who lives in Astoria and has a young son. She either embezzled $3 million or witnessed him taking all that, or whatever, it is pretty complex. She fled and now assumed a new identity as a teacher in Oregon. Kimble's partner for the case is former teacher Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) who will go undercover as a kindergarten teacher to find her son, while John works on the case from the outside. Before she can go in, she gets hit with brutal food poisoning, leaving Kimble to take her place. Can he handle it?So far the movie is like a regular Arnold action film from this period. It is gritty and brutal like his others. Problem is, the movie doesn't quite juggle the realistic grittiness with the charm of the youngsters.Kimble's time teaching is hilarious. He can't handle the mischief of the students which gets the audience roaring. I just wished that there were more actually belly-laughs like it could have had. Instead, we mostly get charmed with smile on our faces. There is even a romance worked into it that has him falling for a fellow teacher (Penelope Ann Miller) whose son Dominic is in Kimble's class. I always liked it. Not much of a problem is set up with this serious subplot, it is the unnecessary other serious subplots added too. Kimble thinks that the kid with the answers is an abused boy named Zack. It is very heartbreaking. When Crisp returns, he turns the entire school into a war zone, which is pretty intense for kids. Don't get me wrong, it was fun. But the movie didn't seem where it wanted to go in terms of style.Kindergarten Cop does feature some hilarious bits. But it does not live up to its full potential as a comedy. Snotty-nosed children with a hard-nosed cop sounds like a recipe for laughter. But the movie wants to capture the realistic grittiness of fighting off psychotic drug lords. Why not just do what any other movie would have done and water down the serious aspect? That would have made more room for the laughter and the entire movie experience that much more pleasant. Could the movie have worked better with another director? Perhaps. Instead we a get a fun movie that doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a serious action piece or a cute family film. We all want the latter.3/4",Kindergarten Cop
55,PredragReviews,"""Zhere iss no bartroom!""",7,6 May 2016,"We are used to seeing Arnie in fast-action, violent films with lots of killing and blood, like 'Terminator' and 'Predator' where he hardly says anything apart from ""I'll be back!"". Therefore it is quite a surprise that here we see him playing a tough cop-turned-Kindergarten-teacher and you may not think that he would be much good in that type role, because i know i certainly did and i started watching it rather skeptically. However, i couldn't have been more wrong. Arnie plays the role amazingly and i couldn't really imagine anyone else playing the giant school teacher. The cast are great, it has a real feel-good vibe to it, and the chemistry between the star and the children is spot on. The story is basically about a tough cop who has to go undercover as a Kindergarten teacher to find the wife and son of an elusive criminal. Then he must persuade he to give evidence to convict her ex-husband and get him 'sent down' for a long long time.""Kindergarten Cop"" is nothing less than great entertainment. It captures the very essence of the simple, feel-good story, here blended together with a bit of action and an edge that works surprising well against the comedy; nearly as well as the juxtaposition that is ""bodybuilder teaches kindergarten."" It's great fun, one of the most quotable films of the 1990's, and holds up incredibly well almost a quarter-century after its release.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Kindergarten Cop

It's always a fun time.When rough and tough undercover officer Arnie becomes a kindergarten teacher to undercover a crime, comedy, and some action, ensues. The action is not the fun part though, but it blends in well.Watching Arnold as a teacher is the funniest aspect of this movie. Watching an Austrian, ex body builder with a strong accent using odd techniques to handle his classroom is heaven.One of my personal childhood favorites. 7 stars",Kindergarten Cop
57,mattymatt4ever,Starts terrific; the rest is just pretty good,7,17 September 2002,"I watched ""Kindergarten Cop"" for the first time in about 8 years.  Between that, I've seen segments of it on USA, but this was the first time I watched it straight through.  I loved the first 30-35 minutes.  In the first act, the movie firmly grabs your attention with a unique blend of action and comedy.  And of course, I got to hear an explosion of Arnold's trademark one-liners.  I was on the floor when he broke up that party by blasting his machine gun and said, ""Next time, my place.""  There are also some very amusing moments where he first meets the Kindergarten students.  And I found it hilarious when the single mothers of the students sent their kids to ask Arnold if he's married, so they can get a date with him.  Pamela Reed practically runs away with the show as Arnold's partner.  She's a fine actress, with incredible comic timing and delivery, and I haven't seen her in too many recent movies.  My favorite scene of hers is when Arnold gets ready for his first day as a teacher.  He struts out in a suit with a gun strapped to his shirt.  He asks, ""How do I look?""  She responds, ""Lose the gun.""  Then he asks what it was like when she used to teach Kindergarteners. She says, ""On second thought, keep the gun.""  Basically, Arnold and Pamela make a great team and their chemistry is on-target.  The rest of the movie I didn't care too much for.  It falters into melodrama way too quickly and becomes dark and predictable.  In other words, this is not the ideal film to take the kids to.  It's surprisingly violent and contains references to drugs.  ***************MINOR SPOILER AHEAD*********** There's even a scene where one of the characters dies of a drug overdose. Definitely not for the kids!  I'm sure many are already familiar with this film, but just in case there are parents out there who haven't seen this movie and are looking for something to watch with the family...go rent ""The Flintstones"" or something.  With stronger writing, this movie could've succeeded much better.  Instead, it resorts to cliches and overused movie conventions past the 35-minute mark.  But I repeat, this is not for the kids!  My score:  7 (out of 10)",Kindergarten Cop

Well, it worked in Twins so why not do it again? Actually this time around he fares very well, balancing quite nicely his tough guy side (which we all love) and also his comedic side. His interaction with the children are hilarious and somewhat touching at times. Supporting cast do a nice job, particularly Reed as Arnie's partner and Hunt as his kindergarten supervisor.Many critics found the level of violence to be a little excessive considering it's listed as mainly a comedy, but I don't agree. Sure, there's some violence near the end, but it's relatively toned down. I'd say this is good family fun.",Kindergarten Cop
59,Stampsfightclub,Enjoyable fun sweet/tough natured comedy,8,29 October 2006,"Its normally every other day you see Arnold in a tough guy role e.g. The Terminator series and here he portrays a professional cop, until he is forced to go undercover as a kindergarten teacher, an absolute genius move from the director of 'Twins' Reitman. Schwarzenegger is very convincing in this new role as a man who has to live two very different lives and the sheer humour of seeing him in this position is an essential watch for anyone. His character here is amazing, a real laugh with or at character, living humorously, seriously and emotionally throughout, a reflection of a real person's lives, reflecting society traits. It is hard to accept him as a great actor sometimes which, to many stubborn fans is emphasised here. He performed well as the tough/sentimental guy. The story is very well crafted and thankfully always believable, maybe apart from the ending. It is very consistent with different ideologies thrown around to add up to a slow moving story completed with a fast flowing ending. The use of encoding ideologies involving parenthood, crime, jobs, relationship, loyalty, drugs and friendship etc are all well used to emphasise society's most important factors. As a comedy the main method used was for the tough guy to be creamed into a sweet natured role, which was great to watch. The children all convey a menacing iconography which is also enjoyable to watch.I loved Pamela Reed's character. Reed (Junior) was fantastic as the sarcastic partner to Arnold and was very enjoyable to watch, watch out for one of her last lines. There are many twists used which add to the tension of the film, mostly conveying a comedy element which justifies the genre. The use of a stereotype villain allows younger audiences to appreciate the character, always aware of who he is and what he is planning to do. The dark distinctive music playing is always associating with him, creating a conventional but good feel to the nature of the character. The story is built up well because nothing is rushed. Context is always believable. Arnie's relationship with the children is definitely the key part of the film and is a must watch. if you like Arnie's tough guy roles, the this is a complete opposite - he is a class act here as a sentimental teacher!8.5/10",Kindergarten Cop
60,spookyrat1,An Apple for Teachers!,8,28 April 2019,"Kindergarten Cop, despite its run of the mill title, is definitely not one of your run of the mill Arnold Schwarzenegger action films, though it may have been. Apparently Arnold insisted that the content realistically reflect the teaching role, rather than just pay stereotypical lip service to the profession, as so many films do. In doing so, he influenced the making of one of the better films about teachers that I've seen. And I'm a teacher.For once every thing looks right. The kindergarten class looks like a kindergarten class looks. It's the right size, has the right furnishings and the right stuff on the walls. More important, the child actors look and behave like a genuine kindergarten class of students. The student numbers look right. They ask typical questions kids might ask, give the sort of responses you'd expect and offer the sort of ""daily news"" of which any pre-school teacher would be familiar.The film also gives a fairly accurate insight into teaching work. Arnold finds that it is far more stressful and complex than he initially expected and that it frequently is laced and affected by a myriad of socio-economic issues. But to its credit, the film also didn't hesitate to show how personally rewarding the educating of kids can be to a skilled practitioner.Penelope Ann Miller is very convincing as Arnold's supportive, experienced teaching colleague, who gradually becomes his love interest. And Linda Hunt is a sensible choice as the school principal, initially wary of Arnold's John Kimble, but like the kids in his class, warming to him over time.The film's core is essentially a hybrid rom-com drama about teachers, but it is bookended by a police procedural storyline that's OK too and amazingly didn't really intrude too much on the main story. Richard Tyson in what arguably is his best known role, makes a good villain.I tend to agree with Roger Ebert, who among other things, said of Kindergarten Cop that it ...""is made up of two parts that shouldn't fit, but somehow they do, making a slick entertainment out of the improbable ...""",Kindergarten Cop

I'm not saying the movie was poor because it wasn't; in fact, it was a good one, but what I am saying is that this movie looked much more than a comedy. This is important because most people rate this as a comedy film, but it looked more of a crime film than a comedy one, so I think it's the other way around. Coming to the movie itself, Kindergarten Cop was an interesting one right from the start. A lot of the parts were not only funny, but also serious considering the plot of the movie. At times, there were some parts that I found frightening, but that's of no surprise considering the temporary school teacher is actually an undercover cop who has a mission to solve. Basically, the plot for this movie wasn't bad. I particularly enjoyed the final part or last half of the movie - it really starts to get interesting. I'm actually surprised a sequel wasn't made based on the cop John Kimble - his character was a really interesting one, and it didn't matter had the title been a different one to that.",Kindergarten Cop

It's mainstream enough, the humor, the acting standard enough. It's got a highly recognizable face and lead character stereotype that America usually adores, a simple enough plot and development with morals, cute children and family values at the center of it... and to be honest, it does a pretty darn good job at what it sets out to do.In a way, it's much better than what it ""should've been"".And yet, the fan average barely scrapes over the 6/10 mark and the critics are just as snobby towards it but that's to be expected.'Arnie' is charming and unintentionally/intentionally hilarious as ever, the film has simply monumentally cult quotes, it's fast, cute, fun, funny, and of course it's got that bit of hollow flavor towards the end where great movies usually shine most, but it's absolutely tolerable when we're given such a genuinely entertaining ride prior.A well earned 7/10.

Kimble, along with his witty partner Phoebe O'Hara (wonderfully played by Pamela Reed), travel to where the boy and his mother are hiding out in Astoria, Oregon. Phoebe was originally supposed to be the one going undercover as the teacher since she's had teaching experience. But on the way she gets sick with food poisoning, and Kimble (who has no teaching experience at all) ends up taking over for her. At first he struggles with the rambunctious tykes as they get on his nerves. But soon the kids start to like him as he uses some of his own teaching lessons with a little bit of help from Phoebe. Along the way he falls in love with a fellow teacher who's son is in his class. The scenes with the kids are the best, with the tykes providing some of the funniest dialogue in the film. The performances are terrific. Schwarzenegger proves that even though he's usually an action star, he can do comedy as well. Reed is very funny as Phoebe (her illness scenes are a hoot). Penelope Ann Miller shines as Joyce, the teacher Kimble falls for. And Oscar-winning actress Linda Hunt (from ""The Year of Living Dangerously"") steals many of her scenes as the diminutive school principal. Cathy Moriarty (""Raging Bull""), Park Overall (TV's ""Empty Nest""), and Jayne Brook (TV's ""Chicago Hope"") have delightful bit parts as mothers of some of Kimble's students. The only parts of ""Kindergarten Cop"" that I objected to were the violent moments early and late in the film. This movie would have been perfect for kids if it weren't for the violence.

Crisp has been on the trail of his ex-wife and son, who fled and are incognito in picturesque Astoria, Oregon. John Kimble and partner Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) are sent up the coast, also to track down Crisp's former wife and son. The law believes that the wife took $3 million of Crisp's drug money, so John Kimble and Phoebe O'Hara are authorized to give her immunity if she is willing to testify against him. Meanwhile, a whacked-out star witness has died of a drug overdose, and a lawyer has Crisp legally sprung; he is on his way to Astoria. Supported by his twisted mother, Eleanor Crisp (Carol Baker), the ""brains"" of the outfit, he wants his six year-old son back. Although Kimble and O'Hara have already tracked down the son (Cullen Crisp Jr.) to Astoria Elementary School, they do not know his (or his mother's) identity. Which pupil is the right one, and who is Crisp's ex-wife? Suspicions fall on several leads, including attractive teacher Joyce Palmieri (Penelope Ann Miller) and her son, Dominic, who is a pupil at the school. But then again, Joyce's lifestyle does not appear to match one who has several million dollars. Phoebe, as an ex-teacher, was originally assigned to go undercover as one of the schoolteachers. As she becomes ill because of food poisoning, and has to recover in her motel room, John Kimble winds up in the teaching role. Pint-sized Miss Schlowski (Linda Hunt) is the school principal, and she and John make a fine Mutt and Jeff pair when together. In the early days of school, he-man Arnold (John), obviously out of his comfort zone, is fine fodder for the kids. But the children are so beautiful and innocent to watch. See how darling Emma (Sarah Rose Karr) is! She's the one who says her father has a mustache and beard, and has such a big head that he cannot wear hats. Over time Arnold eventually instills class discipline, and he exhibits fine qualities, like empathy, sympathy, and understanding. As Miss Schlowski soon discovers, he develops into a fine teacher. But Crisp is getting closer Selected favorite quotes: (1) Child Lowell asking about a teacher who had to go away: ""Did she die?"" (2) Kimble responding to child Joseph who has briskly commented on the differences between male and female anatomy: ""Thanks for the Tip.""

Kindergarten cop... about a seasoned policeman who must hunt down a known criminal that has been slipping through the cracks of the system, which leads Mister Kimball (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to a quaint small town where the girlfriend of known criminal resides. Taking it upon himself Kimball decides to become a teacher under cover for the simple reason that one of his students is the son of the woman he is seeking played by Penelope Ann Miller. In the middle is his partner Phoebe (Pamela Reed) who keeps his identity under wraps until it is time to take down their prey Crisp (Richard Tyson).The laughs start the moment the movie starts when Arnie tries to cope with his gang of misfit students who for the most part are more dangerous than some of the highly notorious criminal underground put together. It's just like his partner says... 'Once they have you, you are theirs for keeps.' When watching, a person can appreciate on how most if not all teachers try to keep their sanity in check when dealing with their students on a daily basis. This wonderful tale of taking down a bad guy amidst a battlefield of innocent but deadly kids was amusing in every way. To see Arnie break down to nothing more than a worn out husk makes one think of why he is so used to just using his fists, and a big gun to catching his prey.That not all heroes can rely on just brute force for their goal, only to realize that there is more to his job than meets the eye. What was so amazing too was that even after he took down Crisp Kimball decides to keep teaching his brood in order for his insane life to achieve some semblance of order with the help of Dominic (played by the Cousin twins), and his mother Joyce (Penelope). It is a great story with a generic theme of bad versus good, but with a knock out plot of tossing in some highly charged kindergarten students to make his life just a bit more interesting.For police fans this is one of the more different themes but you will enjoy the story as it unfolds. You'll laugh, you'll cry and even root for Dominic when he tries to escape his father's (crisp's) strangle hold as the worst father of the year.

Arnold laughs at himself, from his previous papers, worse so naturally that it is even more fun. I remember reading that years later Stallone compared this movie with his ""Stop or my mother shoots"" and he did not understand why ""Cop"" had reaped so much success and his did not ... I did not comment. While the protagonist's performance is very good we must not forget the rest of his co-stars, funny and natural kids that raise a smile when you least expect it. They are irreverent, funny and tender, and you end up feeling as much affection for some of them as he does.",Kindergarten Cop

76,ThomasColquith,A weak film,4,30 October 2021,"""Kindergarten Cop"" is not a good film although it had good cinematography and settings. The highlight of this film is Arnold delivering some lines in a uniquely Arnold way and him interacting with the children. But the plot as a whole is not good, the villains silly caricatures and the story lacks any kind of twist or substance. Not a film that I will watch again anytime soon. My rating: 4/10.",Kindergarten Cop
77,AwesomeWolf,I wish Arnie had been my teacher,8,11 January 2005,"I reckon Arnie would make the best teacher. For starters, he could teach PE, and Austrian, and politics, and awesome, among other things. Schoolyard bullying and vandalism would be a thing of the past, and if any of the students were having domestic troubles at home, Arnie would find out and then BAM! Problem solved, just like in 'Kindergarten Cop'.Arnie plays John Kimble, a cop who has spent years chasing a criminal by the name of Cullen Crisp. When he finally gets Crisp, he now has to find all the money Crisp that stole. It seems as though Crisp's e-wife took it and fled to a small town with their son, and changed their names in the process. To find them, Arnie must pose as a kindergarten teacher, and hilarity ensues.'Kindergarten Cop' may not be as heavy on the action as some of Arnie's other movies from the time (80s / early 90s), but on the other hand, it is very funny. It delivers some classic lines from not only Arnie, but also his disciples of awesome (students, whatever you wish to call them). 'Kindergarten Cop' proves that Arnie is family-friendly, as well as awesome. Bravo!8/10 - Check it out. You should like it, and if you don't, I'm sure Arnie will forgive you.",Kindergarten Cop
78,fredericksmith1952,"Before this, I think everyone thought about Arnold as Conan or the Terminator.",9,16 May 2012,"And you can hardly blame them. After all, Arnold is the muscular, imposing prototype for the majority of action heroes on the screen today. Even after Twins, Arnold had a lot of resistance to using him in non-action roles. But this role is the one that proved he could be funny and still make a great impression on the audience and fans alike.Arnold is all the things any action hero would cringe at, polite, gentle, understanding, and even in touch with his feelings.Pamela Reed is the perfect foil for Arnold in this lighthearted comedy with a twist. Her presence on the screen provides just the right amount of pure comedy and tomfoolery to make the less than plausible scenes work. And as usual, she ends up with all the great lines.Penelope Ann Miller is, well, Penelope Ann Miller. Her role as the teacher across the hall from Arnold's class gives the two of them a few occasions to intermingle, but I think Reitman could have made a few more scenes work.Linda Hunt is absolutely delightful as the principal who looks on while this brooding hulk of a man tries to tame the wild children.Cathy Moriarity provides us with a look into the ""single parent capital of the west"", and while her role is brief, her input and presence is remarkable.Overall, the film has a buoyancy that allows you to sit through the more placid moments and still want to stay in your seat to see what happens.The real stars are the kids, of course, and I would be remiss not to mention early appearances by Odette Yustman (now Annable), Adam Wylie, and Krystle and Tiffany Mataras, to mention just a few.Rated PG-13 for references to drugs, some language, and some violence, this film is a classic for the kids (I'd say 10 and up, but that is your call) and definitely a keeper for your collection.",Kindergarten Cop
79,vip-danii,Surprisingly Good!,9,8 May 2013,"As a big Arnie fan, I thought this movie was going to be godawful, and ruin my fondness of the man, so... when it first came out, I refused to watch it. I was sure it was going to be embarrassingly cheesy. However, when I finally saw it, I was pleasantly surprised (and relieved).The movie was funny and heart-warming. The characters were charismatic, interesting, and well-developed. The acting was surprisingly good. The kids were very cute, too. There were some child actors I recognized from other movies, which I quite liked. Namely, the little girl from ""Beethoven"", and the boy from ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare"" (a Freddy Kruger movie).The only reason someone would criticize this movie, I imagine, would be for the fact, that its apparent target audience is kids. In reality, though, young children are not likely to appreciate this movie. It's more of a clean comedy for adults, rather than a family movie, I think.All in all, an entertaining movie that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone.",Kindergarten Cop

82,talllwoood13,insultingly awful,3,7 September 2021,"The movie starts off with a disheveled cop named John Kimble. For this review I'm just going to say Arnold chasing after this dirty looking mafia guy with a wig that looks so fake I think that it's the biggest crime in this movie. I could be wrong but it looks like the same mall that a ton of movies in the 80s and 90s was shot in such as Chopping Mall from 1987.I find a majority of this movie is way too convenient. I mean sure this isn't a thought provoking thriller or mystery movie and someone 10 and under is supposed to be watching this but it's just insulting. I don't think if I was 10 I would have enjoyed this and really the only people over 10 I feel who would are just nostalgic and how dare I make fun of their childhood.Fun fact the school in this game heavily inspired the horror game Silent Hill the original on PS1.I'll admit the banter most of the kids say came off as authentic. I wonder which one of the kids is the directors son if they have any. However getting Arnold to be a teacher that scenario is so silly I don't think in a million years a police officer could be a teacher so easily if not ever. Especially after punching the one kids father. But alright back to ""BS land"" everyone is far too trustworthy in this movie. I find it kind of silly how Arnold is like a drill sergeant to the kids. I'm sure the other teachers hate him every time that whistle blows.There are some great shots of the scenery, I like all the mountains and all in the distance as well.Other than a scene or two that red headed partner is not worth being in the movie other than some unnecessary filler. Thankfully she wasn't the love interest. I did not find her funny at all. In the beginning of the movie she is so unlikable.Mr. Crisp I find it hilariously ironic that he sets the school on fire. However he is the most poorly cast one in the movie. He tries so hard to be like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction and other mafia roles but he comes off too nice. I mean sure it's a kids movie but he can't act to save his life. If he should have went to any school it should have been acting school along with half the cast (I do like Arnold though). It's almost creepy how obsessive his mother is. Mr. Crisp looks like he plays in a white snake or some glam rock band on the 80s in the same old greasy bar for beer tokens or like a burnt out art or gym teacher which is probably what I would have cast him as at best in this movie.Although there was a few curve balls to throw us off to say this movie is too predictable. I found Dominic's mother blew her cover too easily. I also wonder how long it was for her to be a teacher as it takes some time to be even full time. But we got to give the movie some credit to make a believable situation. I would not have named the kid Dominic it's too obvious of course he has to have the mobster dad.The plot is awful and I can admire Arnold for doing something different than being tight cast to action movies but this is just one of those movies where if it wasn't for Arnold I don't think anyone would have watched it. He's the fine line between this being a tv movie and a movie you'd pay to watch. Maybe a few cast changes and a re-write to certain parts of this alleged classic and I may have enjoyed it more than a 3/10.",Kindergarten Cop
83,wchngliu,"Not Bad, Although Miles Better Than His Other Effort ,Junior",7,1 December 2007,"Kindergarten Cop was panned by a number of critics when it was first released back in 1990, of whom saw this as a big career blow to his Hollywood superstar action movie status. Despite its ridicule, this is still a fun little film to watch, just as long as you don't take it seriously, i mean it is supposed to be a comedy, after all.Arnold 'i'll be back' Schwarzenneger plays hard-ass cop John Kimble, who goes undercover by posing as a school teacher, in an attempt to track down a guy by the name of Cullen Crisp, who he has been pursing for a considerable time. Along the way, he befriends a little boy and eventually falls for his mother, who is a teacher at the school. Of course hilarity ensues and thus, it isn't long before he is irritated and annoyed by the kids themselves; however, Kimble manages to win them over and becomes so convincing as a teacher, up until the very end of the film that they hardly notice that he is a cop.The kids were cute and often funny, the violence can be a little excessive, depending on how you view it and the film was really enjoyable. The funniest moments were the one-liners of Arnie's: 'shut up! shut up! shut up!', 'who's your daddy and what does he do?' and 'there is no bathroom!' In the UK, when this film was originally released in cinemas, it got a PG rating, but afterwards this was changed to a 15- which is ridiculous because the film can be enjoyed by the whole family.Obviously this is not up there with The Terminator, True Lies and Predator to name, but as ridiculous and silly as it is, Kindergarten Cop is good clean fun.

90,HK_Key-Si_HK,Though the eyes of a kid...,5,23 March 2018,"Back in the 90s there were tons of Comedy movies with a very weird twist or idea behind them, and without a doubt Kindergarten Cop is one of them. After the main villain Crisp (Richard Tyson) got arrested for murder by Detective John Kimble (Arnold Schwarzenegger), the cops were not able to find the money involved in a case before recent events and assume it must be put aside by the (now former) wife Joyce (Penelope Ann Miller). She started a new life in Oregon with her little son Dominic (played by Christian and Joseph Cousins) and so Kimble and his partner and former teacher, Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed), plan to go undercover. A stomach flu forces the duo to change their plans and now instead of O'Hara, Kimble has to pose as the teacher for the kindergarten class. And that is where the fun starts, because he basically has no clue what to do with these young kids. There are quite a few funny moments in this movie and it will work just great to show it to your own kids while they are still young. It's definetely one of those movies who are nice to grow up with and I also have lots of feelings of nostalgia when I think about Kindergarten Cop. Re-watching this as an adult on the other hand doesn't have this impact at all though. Movies got a lot better during the years and this makes a film like this seem very naive and innocent, which can be a good thing, but unfortunately also quite incompetent. Now we notice all the flaws we didn't even care about as we saw it though the eyes of a kid. Having experienced both sides of the coin let's just leave this movie with a smile and put it to the average flicks we loved back in the good old days... But show it to your kids!",Kindergarten Cop

I'm glad I finally got around to it. Mr. Arnold does a fantastic job of portraying how enjoyable and frustrating (at times) it is to be a teacher. And, of course, he makes it easy for us to laugh at his cost. I really liked how a lot of the movie was relatable and pretty much spot on about the way young kids and their teachers and parents interact with one another. Speaking of the kids, they were all so cute and smart!! But, maybe a little bit too much. Most kids at that age do not know about the human anatomy. There were a lot of scenes that made me reminisce about my childhood. Heck, the movie made me want to become a teacher. Yes, it was a realistic representation of the occupation. I will say it was slightly predictable that Joyce and Dominic were the ones the cops were looking for. And the classic 80s/90s acting style is ever present. But other than that, very enjoyable and it left me with a big smile for the duration and after. There is some fantastic and memorable dialogue and a real plot. Loved it.

94,streetrodfan,Did a pedophile help penn this,6,24 May 2012,"It's taken in retrospect as a classic. And as a Arnold family film. But when you start watching this movie , it's pretty perverse, and twisted. What should be a innocent children's film, with some adult humor, is a movie riddled with perverted, disgusting dialog. The children are talking about vaginas, and sex, and it's not funny. It's just sort of disgusting. I know there are hurdles , with a children's film, casting Arnold, a (bad ass). But, they forced the more adult humor into places, just because those places took up most the screen time. And it came off like a pedophile was penning the script, or had tried his hand. It was as if they just couldn't make it work without adding adult humor in un-necessary places, because the majority of the film was scenes with the children. It took the funny route, as Arnold is a adult action film star, but I don't feel that the humor worked out ethically enough. And the script is awkward, and it sort of taints the movie for me, it's sort of degrading. I don't think they portray things realistically ,and they do it in a sort of derogatory way. It seems to be more Hollywood trash, crap at the bulk, with a big billed star like Arnold.But still the movie has some substance, merit. It's entertaining , a pretty good film, but these little scenes really take a lot out of the movie for me. There are a few good moments, it makes it worth watching. One where Arnold beats up a child abuser, (it's not realistic, legal, but it's entertaining) .There are parts that make it worth watching. It's entertaining , it's a alright movie. But little scenes, even pointless scenes, little things, tib bits, some almost subliminal are totally un- necessary. How he trains the children is kind of creepy, it's like he's a dictator , and it's mind control. It's militant, it's kind of cute...But, also it borders on some sort of bizarre philosophy how people are raised, conditioned by society. I tend to look a little into things too much, but I find parents will think this movie has a few perverse scenes.",Kindergarten Cop

I don't see why people complain about this being an action/comedy film that has to do with Kindergarten. I've seen people on IMDb act like kids couldn't see it because of the violence.

To find a film that combines an extreme uplifting sensation with a very intense, dark, dramatic tone is a rarity indeed. Yet this movie pulls it off to such a degree it comes out just short of being a masterpiece.It does everything right. The movie takes place in Oregon of all places, yet the cinematography makes great use of the location, it sorta makes you want to move into this small town community. The actors are fantastic. Everybody in the film gives 100%, and the kids that make up the kindergarten class deserve a tremendous applause, cause let's face it, they practically steal the show. Lastly, the musical score is absolutely fantastic and contributes greatly to the overall feel of the movie, as is usually the case, but this is one instance where it would be a completely different film without the music to back it up.The best way to describe this movie...it's a movie with a lot of heart.

103,Dolemite_motherfcker,A unique film that shouldn't be missed,10,30 January 2010,"I've seen a fair few movies from that magical time: The early 90s and Kindergarten Cop is among the best of them. Fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger should definitely see it, as should anyone with a good sense of humour and a fondness of good old Hollywood formula plots.Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as police detective John Kimble. He has arrested a high rank drug dealer, Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) for murder. He has a witness, but the police also intend to prosecute him on as many other charges as they can. The witness to the murder, overheard the victim telling Crisp where his wife and son are, who left him and supposedly stole $3 million of his drug money. Kimble and his new partner Phoebe O'Hara (Pamela Reed) are sent to the small idyllic coastal town of Astoria, Oregon, to find the drug dealer's ex wife and son, who now have different identities and get his ex wife to testify against him. O'Hara is supposed to be undercover as a Kindergarten teacher at the son's school while both her and Kimble investigate the Kindergarten class's parents to try and find Crisp's ex wife. However, O'Hara get's food poisoning so Kimble has to teach the class. At first, the children have little respect for him, but with a little time and discipline, they all grow fond of him and he finds out that he is a natural born teacher. Throughout the course of the movie, Arnie gains the attraction of the class's single mothers, helps an upset boy who is being physically abused by his father and romances the pretty young mother of the drug dealer's son. The movie climaxes with a really exhilarating showdown between Arnie and the drug dealer, who is eventually released on bail and comes to Astoria in search of his wife and son.Everything in Kindergarten Cop is handled so brilliantly that I wonder why it didn't get a much more positive reaction from critics, rather than the actual 50/50 divide. The movie is expertly paced, brimming with memorable dialogue and scenes and brought to life with a simply great score by Randy Edelman. Schwarzenegger's acting is good too. I will never understand those people who call him ""wooden"" and whatnot. The Kindergarten children are all fantastic little actors who I can safely say surpass plenty of adult movie actors I have seen. They are much better than Patrick Swayze (RIP, he was great in some films) in Red Dawn. While the plot is very formulaic when stripped to it's bare bones, the actual details are incredibly original. For example, I especially like the idea of the villain always being accompanied by his rather amusing but sinister mother and the way the son of the drug dealer is haunted by faint memories of his father and has an adorably childish way of trying to reassure that he never comes back. The screenwriters of this film, clearly have some talent. Back to the children, they are hilarious, especially the little boy who is obsessed with death, the little boy who's father is a gynaecologist who is obsessed with vaginas and one comically sissy little girl. The scenes between Schwarzenegger and the kids are very funny and truly classic.Kindergarten cop: Touching, hilarious, well paced, will written, well scored, exciting and refreshing. In short, a classic. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this film.",Kindergarten Cop
104,Opethian,The Greatest Film of All Time!,10,4 April 2004,"This is my favourite film of all time. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the hottest and therefore best actor of all time, flexes his brain muscles with the kiddies in this charming family film that will appeal to all. The film opens with Arnold acting brilliantly, looking hot in a supermarket. It works up to a devastating climax of child explosions (in a metaphorical sense).""Citizen Kane"" cannot hold a candle to the innovative cinematography of this film. And did I mention that Arnold looks really hot in this film? Way hotter than Orson Welles, who is non-hot and fat. Unfortunately, Arnold doesn't take off his shirt in this film, but it is a family picture, so I guess the director, Ivan Reitman, forced him to wear one.
This is a pedagogical meisterwork!! Check it out today!",Kindergarten Cop
105,foufoutos-53734,you hit the kid i hit you,1,14 August 2017,"no this is not a positive message in a movie directed to children despite its violence Linda hunt may be happy with Arnold beating up a physically inferior abusive father but that's not a humane approach to the serious subject of domestic violence, the answer is not more violence the papa bear character does exactly to the abusive father what the abusive father does to his child would an intervention like this make the father less violent or more loving towards his kid in real life? Oh now i got my ass kicked, i wont beat you even harder but i understand i was wrong, Arnie's punches on my head made me see the light. That was back in 1990. Have all these movies made our society a better one, i wonder? Or are they just pure entertainment, no hidden agenda or social messages?",Kindergarten Cop
106,chris-698,One of my favorites,7,5 November 1999,"I watched this movie again recently, and while reminded of recent school shootings, I'd still have to say it's one of our family's favorites. While some parts are a little dark to qualify this as a family film, I think it's handled well overall. The very ending still gets me misty-eyed.",Kindergarten Cop
107,johnsonmukherjee,"Beautiful, heart touching, peaceful ending",10,27 March 2021,It has an amazing happy ending with some happy kids. So it's really heart touching. And the movie is also great. It's quite a pleasure to see all those kids acting so nicely. It's a great movie.,Kindergarten Cop
108,ut1am,Arnie takes on comedy and wins!,10,17 June 2006,"Kindergarten Cop is a great film. It contains some of Schwarzenegger's best work showcasing his innate likability and comic timing in a piece which allows them to accentuate his more often seen action star persona. The lightening of this persona works in the film allowing us to follow Arnie's Kimble into what could easily be a weak and twee concept. Fortunately Arnie doesn't lose his balls in the transition and Reitman directs the action very well as well as showing the same skill in comedy as he did with previous hits such as Ghost Busters. Ricky Tyson makes a brilliant villain not in his being an equal to Schwarzenegger but in his portraying a drug dealer with a grudge as a three dimensional character who will stop at nothing to get his son back. Schwarzeneeger also gets to get have some romance and although he at times looks ready to kill his very beautiful love interest (Penelope Ann Miller) he manages to be a very charming lead who the audience are helpless but to root for. The screenplay by Salem, Harris and Weingrod is both touching and funny with memorable lines such as the deadpan interrogation scene ""Who is your daddy and what does he do?"". The kids also are great featuring a diverse group who almost steal the show with lines such as ""Boy's have a penis, girl's have a vagina"". The film also contains some classic Arnie one liners such his ""I'm the party pooper"" kiss off before shooting down some low lives. Such lines refer to Arnie's tough guy persona and shows that he is not afraid to poke fun at himself. The difference in Kindgarten Cop is that he is playing a vulnerable human character and the audience does not want him to be hurt not just because he is the hero but because they like him. The score too is exceptional being appropriately sweet and upbeat as well at sometimes hitting darker more sinister tones. They truly don't make them like this anymore, just see awful modern examples such as Vin Diesel's The Pacifer for proof or rather don't see them, watch Kindergarten Cop again and see a great action star and comedy director team up to make a most enjoyable work.",Kindergarten Cop
109,Gator761,One of my favorite early 90's movies,9,19 February 2001,"Kindergarten Cop is one of the greatest movies produced during the early 90's, an era of cheesy innocence, and also unaware of its utter dorkiness. The transition from the 80's to the ultra-sad PC era we live in was not an easy one.  This is evidenced by the dress of the people outside the junkie apartment where the party is at the beginning of the movie.  Those Mexican guys with mullets and leather jackets.  And the witness, Cindy.  Nice cowboy boots. One of the greatest things about this film is Schwarzenegger's performance.  He is extremely likeable, and is genuinely funny in numerous scenes.  A lot of the things he says are even funnier because of his Austrian accent. I guess its funny for me because a lot of the lines are so cheesy, and I still laugh when I hear them.  I have watched this movie over and over and can recite each and every line by heart. Memorable lines include: ""Did your daddy teach you this game?""  ""On second thought, take the gun.""  ""You're not so tough without your car, are ya?"" ""Who is your daddy, and what does he do?""  ""I'm the party poopah.""  ""Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to introduce myself.  My name is John Kimble.  And I love my car.""  ""Yo man, I'm just gonna keep an eye on it for ya, alright?""The list goes on and on.  There is a slight darkness that comes into this film occasionally, but I don't mind it too much, considering that it is much less violent than Schwarzenegger's other movies.  Overall, unless you were a kid when the movie came out, you may not appreciate it as much as I do.If this movie were made today, it would be criticized for showing violence in a school, and how it is teaching kids to kill and all of that nonsense. The early 90's taught us not to be so self-aware and critical, just like the kids in the movie.  That life should be care-free.",Kindergarten Cop
110,sreedhar-passion555,Great Movie With Great Background Music,10,18 October 2007,"Arnold is well and perfectly suited as Jhon Kimble. This movie is very distinct of Arnie's movies. Arnold has done full of energy and vigorous to suit the best for the role.Director has given his extent and intensity considerably above the normal or average to the movie. Director had assured that this movie is lively and playful amusement while watching.Photography was totally great and it feels the natural features of the land scape. Full of vivid and full of interest to the viewing characters of kindergarten Cop.Music, especially background score is ultimate. He has given very touching music and it still rocks even today. Whenever i watch the movie, the background music of this film lifts with great feeling. In fact music played an important role to make this film such a wonderful film. All and all movie is simply excellent and background music is simply extraordinary.",Kindergarten Cop
111,JabberJG,"Funny, Heartwarming, and a Bit of Action",9,21 September 2005,"Before I comment, I would just like to say this is my first time on IMDb reviewing a film. I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan and I thought this was one of his finest. I am such a big fan, I can spell his last name without thinking about it and I have a bobble head of Terminator 3 on my computer. Anyways, this movie was great. It was funny in a heartwarming children's comedy sort of way for most of it. It has some of the best Arnold Schwarznegger quotes ever such as, ""DOMINIC!"" ""STOP WHINING!"" and ""IT'S NOT A TUMOR!"" There are also some pretty quotable quotes by other actors. There was decent action scenes for a comedy. The supporting actors did a swell job especially the antagonist and Kimble's partner. I enjoyed the film and would think it should be in the top 250 films list, but everyone has their own opinion and I respect that... sort of. Overall swell movie. I would watch it with your family, but be warned that there are some sexual references and profane or lewd speech so don't watch it with little kids. I would stick with 10 and up.",Kindergarten Cop
112,olivercalimer,"If only this had Dwayne Johnson in, it would be a 10...",9,23 May 2020,"I'm am somewhat new to the whole ""child protecting Jason Bourne"" genre, but this is at the top of the lonely mountain. Arnie's performance is beyond phenomenal, portraying a vast array of emotions such as ""understanding""and ""happiness"" that have not been so apparent in his previous roles. Finally, Arnie has been cast alongside a talent pool of acting Mavericks that just flow freely from his expressive energy. Such lines as ""it's not tooomaaa"" really strikes the appropriate chord for what this film was intended to become, a classic.",Kindergarten Cop

114,ant321ares,This movie is fun!,10,7 June 2005,"To the person who posted before me, I'd like to tell you to get a grip! Those big words don't mean anything to everyday people, they want the truth, not some quaffed up proposals from someone who takes things way too seriously. I suppose you're entitled to your opinion, but don't give up your day job to be a critic! Here's the lowdown: this movie is just that, a movie. It has a lot of funny characters, and it's really funny in some scenes. It's fantasy, and it gives the viewer a chance to escape. Arnold might never have gotten an Oscar for this, but this is not that kind of movie to begin with! It's about a cop who tries to find a Criminals ex wife as a witness and ends up being a Kindergarten teacher, who brings a lot of goodness to the community whilst saving the damsel in distress. It's fun to watch, and goes well with anyone who's building an Arnie collection. rent it, buy it, you'll enjoy it.",Kindergarten Cop

116,spiritedmaiden777,Cute for an afternoon escape from reality,8,3 August 2005,"Love to see this film over and over again. I find this was a turning point for Mr. Schwarzengger as an actor...the challenge of being on ""the wave"" inter-acting with children. The scenic area of the Pacific Northwest also was a plus to the film. Caroll Baker as ""Mother Tyson"" is a great villainess. Wish I had viewed some of her work. The white streak in her hair, was a great flash back to ""Cruella De Ville"". Richard Tyson as ""Crisp"" also plays a smarmy character. Love the contrast of short Linda Hunt's Principal to tall Kimble. Yet Linda proved she could project herself as more formidable than Arnold Schwarzenegger. I also loved the comic timing Broadway's Pamela Reed brought to the film. Her character's pragmatism to Kimble's take it all on, made for another good contrast. Overall the film is good for the whole family or a solitary rainy afternoon escape.",Kindergarten Cop

You should be. The 'nice' side of the story, made to make the audience like you... what a sham. This really highlights the hollowness of American film making and audiences, thankfully this is an old movie and long forgotten since that time, however seeing a replay on television, it was deceptively an interesting story at first but when you consider the themes running through it and the hype that would have been generated during its production and upon its release, it's a very disturbing movie.

121,b_ballcurtis,I Learned Everything I Needed to Know in Life From Kindergarten Cop,10,13 March 2008,"Since the dawn of man, no movie has reached the hearts, minds, and souls of every carbon-based life-form on this planet better than Kindergarten Cop, a film that carries effortlessly both the strength of the law and the tenderness of the human heart. This movie not only redefined entertainment as a whole, it furthermore teaches every individual the great mysteries of the human anatomy, the darkness of the criminal underground, and the enchanted tale of Be-ahs (or ""bears"" to the untrained ear) who go shopping. Truly the Holy Spirit guided the creation of Earth, the Bible, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's superior acting performance. The heroic role of John Kimble in his efforts to not only save an innocent child from a deranged toy-stealing, firefighter-impersonating, ponytail-wearing, drug-dealing slime of a man, but to also save the world one classroom at a time truly displays not only flawless character development but also a man willing to give rather than to take. From Arnold's milk-induced nightmare to being the worst romantic kisser in cinematic history, Arnold's performance in Kindergarten Cop ranks among stellar performances from Hanks, Brando, Pacino, Washington, Crowe, and Chuck Norris (whom Arnold could easily break down faster than any of his Kindergartners). The fact that this movie won no Oscars is the glaring mark on the reputation of the Academy. But rest assured, for as long as there are strangers, firemen with no hats, and vigilante ferrets, this film will continue to enlighten, inspire, and cause us to reflect on our place in society and history. Furthermore this movie created another basic need for every human on the face of the earth: food, shelter, clothing, and Kindergarten Cop. Good night, good luck, and never talk to strangers  or Zach Sullivan*.SPOILER ALERT: * Because he is a Ca-Ca-Poo-Poo.",Kindergarten Cop

123,kwheaton90,An all-round people pleaser!,10,2 January 2010,"Gosh I really don't know what people are complaining about. This movie has become a classic that kids of the 90s will watch over and over and keep laughing every time. So what if it's not 'perfect' by definition? Granted there are some downright cheesy bits, some stuff might not make sense, maybe not the best cinematography etc but who cares? It's so much fun to watch and that's what makes an audience happy, reflected in its success at the box office! Probably a lil too violent for youngsters under the age of 10.(At the time of release I was in junior high and remember sneaking out to see it with friends at the theater because I knew my mom wouldn't be too happy about that.) The story although slightly outrageous is not such that makes it unrealistic. People can relate to this film in various ways as well as being amused by it. Personally I would've liked Arnold to have some more funny interactions with the kids, and maybe his relationship with Joyce/Rachael could've developed further as it had a nice foundation and good chemistry, but everything happened in such a short period of time between them.There easily could have been a sequel but the thing that gives it strength is that they didn't overdo it like so many films do, and this has possibly also enabled it to gain classic status.It really would be great if they brought out deleted scenes, cast interviews or special features on the DVD.",Kindergarten Cop
124,world_o_wiggles,Funniest Movie Ever,8,9 May 2004,"Anyone who dislikes this movie needs to check their minds (yea I went there.) at the door. This has some of the most classic lines in cinema history, such as ""I don't have a tumor!"" And ""Boys have p**** and girls have v*****."" I'll be the first to admit that the acting wasn't top notch (but what do you expect if you've got Arnold?) but this is the type of movie that goes beyond that. It doesn't matter that the lead character is somewhat limited in his acting props. It's got die hard writing.

125,ajbruin,Brief description about Kindergarten Cop,10,28 April 2012,"The mean streets have nothing on John Kimble's kindergarten classroom where answers to life's questions for a five year old can be answered in a way that only Arnold Schwarzenegger can answer. John Kimble is a police officer posing as a substitute kindergarten teacher by chance when partner Phoebe O'Hara played by Pamela Reed who was to be an undercover educator becomes violently ill. They are on a mission to find a would be mother and son team on the run from the estranged and very dangerous Cullen Crisp played by Richard Tyson who O'Hara and Kimble have been after for the murder of an informant back on the streets. The ups and downs and demands of a group of five year olds at times proves to be tougher then this officer of the law imagined with witty questions, lots of resistance and a few tears but through it all he makes a connection with the school, one other teacher in particular in Joyce Palmeiri played by Penelope Ann Miller, and most of all the children In a series of trial and error and some old fashioned detective work Kimble finds the mother and son team and begins to fall for the mom on the run and her child as well as enrich the children's lives with a style of teaching that is called ""unconventional but effective"". In a lighthearted comedy about the trials of teaching children, and finding love there is an underlying theme to the film about tracking down a monster in Kimble, bringing him to justice and keeping everyone safe including Kimble himself. Kindergarten cop is actually a unique film for its fusion of the lighthearted comedy and the police drama and paved the way for such classics as Turner and Hooch as well as many other films blending these two themes together.Set in the picturesque town of Astoria, Oregon the small town life meets the danger of the big city when Crisp finds what he has been looking for and is determined to take back his son with a finish that will leave you wanting more. Kindergarten cop has a little bit of everything for the family including an exciting and climatic finish and a ferret of all things. Does Kimble get his man? Does he save the day? Does he get the girl? Enjoy this Comedrama and find out the answer to those questions as well as having a great time with this film that delivers on laughs, love, and action!!",Kindergarten Cop

127,mccormickja,(Quite possibly) the greatest film of all time.,10,31 December 2004,"The funniest film I've seen in a very, very long time - and it's made even funnier by the fact that Arnie is funny when he doesn't even intend to be funny (infact when he tries to be funny he normally isn't). As you should know by now, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays detective John Kimble who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher to track down the target of one of his lifelong enemies. Lines such as ""who is your daddy and what does he do?"" are undeniable classics. And the part when he tells the kids that he has a headache and a particularly weird kids goes ""maybe its a tumour"" to Arnie's response ""ITS NOT A TUMOUR!"" The way Arnie delivers that line is simply GENIUS. These are only 2 excellent parts of an amazing film. I don't want to spoil it for you at all, but for those who appreciate Arnie in his total godliness, will be laughing pretty much constantly throughout this. I can't resist but... his outburst to the class when he announces his system of police school is unforgettable! GO AND BUY THIS ON DVD RIGHT NOW, or VHS if you're poor.",Kindergarten Cop
