0,MartinHafer,A bit confusing and odd....,6,20 February 2012,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is NOT a movie that most Adam Sandler fans can relate to because it's really not a comedy. However, unlike ""Reign Over Me"" (which was fantastic), this film does not have a traditional narrative. In many ways, it's like a hunk out of someone's life--both good, bad and mundane. It's really a film for particular people with particular tastes. After having seen it, I am not exactly sure WHAT I thought of the film or whether I'd recommend it or not.Adam Sandler plays a man who seems depressed and quite lonely. Instead of being a traditional character, he's just a guy who exists. Because of this, the movie starts off very slowly...VERY slowly. However, though the course of watching him, you see that beneath his very dull and placid exterior, there is some rage which occasionally pops out...but not often.Out of the blue, he calls a phone sex line. However, he doesn't want the lady to talk dirty to him--he just wants to talk to someone. This later causes VERY serious problems in his life. And, later, out of the blue, he meets a lady (Emily Watson) and they fall in love. How the two (as well as pudding) all fit together is VERY odd and very tenuous.Overall, a film with lots of nice parts and lots of dull parts--much like real life. I liked the film but felt a bit confused by it as well. Odd....truly odd.",Punch-Drunk Love
1,TheLittleSongbird,Wonderful film and a contender for Sandler's best performance,10,8 July 2011,"I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, but I watched Punch-Drunk Love because I had heard nothing but good things about it. I was expecting a good movie, but not one this wonderful. It is a beautifully filmed movie, the score is gorgeous and just adds to the scene especially in the romantic parts, the black humour is very funny and some parts are genuinely touching. The script is funny, poignant, thoughtful and clever and the story is always interesting. The acting is much better than I anticipated. I knew Phillip Seymour Hoffmann was going to be brilliant, as he nearly always is, and he is, and Emily Watson is both believable and beguiling. The most pleasant surprise is Sandler, as I've said I am not a fan, he has done some stuff I like but I can find him irritating. Here though, his performance has moments when it is quirky but mostly it is beautiful and understated, not only is Punch-Drunk Love Sandler's best film in my opinion but alongside Reign Over Me it is a contender for his best performance. In conclusion, just wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Punch-Drunk Love
2,SnoopyStyle,memorable use of Sandler,8,2 December 2015,Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) witnesses a crazy car accident and a harmonium is left on the road by a van which he eventually takes. Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) leaves her car keys with him. She is actually a co-worker of his sister Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub) who is desperate to set him up with. She has seven domineering sisters who constantly puts him down always bringing his volatile outburst with a hammer. He's meek man who owns a company distributing novelty items. He blows up angrily at a party with his family. He has a plan to game the frequent flyer miles by buying pudding. He's lonely and finds companionship by talking on a sex chat line. The woman starts harassing him for money. Eventually her boss Dean Trumbell (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sends thugs to collect.Director Paul Thomas Anderson continues his exceptional use of his cast in unique fashion. Adam Sandler is given a chance to stretch. It taps into his persona as a clown. I think true sadness and anger is always underneath the surface of his big acts. Anderson uses it to paint a picture of this character. The visuals are always interesting and Emily Watson is endearing. This is a memorable film.,Punch-Drunk Love
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Very Weird, Unconventional and Unpredictable Love Story",7,8 December 2003,"Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a weird entrepreneur running his own small business. He is very stressed, has some sort of mental problem and is completely dominated by his seven sisters. One day, he finds a harmonium and brings it to his office. He decides to use a `sex-by-phone' service and is blackmailed and threatened by the whore. Meanwhile he meets Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), a friend of one of his sisters, starts dating her and they fall in love for each other. This movie is indeed a strange, unconventional and unpredictable love story. The viewer cannot expect what is going in the next scene. Adam Sandler performs a role totally different from the usual. The story is not long (about 95 minutes), but in Brazil it was released a double DVD. The extra disc has no subtitles, therefore the distributor probably assumed that most of the Brazilian speaks English, what is a shame. This plot is very weird and recommended for specific audience only. My vote is seven.",Punch-Drunk Love
4,classicsoncall,"""I don't freak out very often.""",7,23 April 2018,"As the story plays out, the viewer is expected to take a lot on faith regarding the characters and their motivations. For example, it defies credibility that a phone-sex line would have it's telephone number linked to a legitimate business in a way that Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) could determine Dean Trumbell's (Philip Seymour Hoffman) identity. Or Barry handing the tire iron back to the thug he didn't take his revenge out on. Or the thugs not regrouping to wreak further havoc on Barry since they knew where he lived. I like quirky movies and quirky characters, but I'm not sure if I liked this film all that much. The attraction between Lena (Emily Watson) and Barry seemed genuine enough, but she struck me as kind of a creepy character too. Something about her shifty look and lack of curiosity about the bathroom incident in the restaurant. There was nothing in her personality to suggest that she was on some level of professionalism to be making numerous business trips around the country. Now Dean, I could buy into his neurotic character, unsure of himself in personal relationships and overwhelmed by seven sisters who seemed to take delight in treating him like the unstable person he was. And regarding matters of privacy, you couldn't tell one sister about something without all the rest learning about it sooner or later.So when all this plays out with Barry and Lena finally hooking up, it's not like it wasn't expected or that you couldn't see it coming. That was a given the moment she left her car off for the mechanic. I don't begrudge either of them achieving some sense of normalcy in their lives, but if the harmonium and pudding were any indication, Barry really did need a shrink. And maybe Lena too. As well as Dean and his secretary. For a real sense of closure, I would have expected Dean to get his five hundred bucks back.",Punch-Drunk Love
5,gavin6942,Sandler,7,14 September 2014,"A psychologically troubled novelty supplier (Adam Sandler) is nudged towards a romance with an English woman (Emily Watson), all the while being extorted by a phone-sex line run by a crooked mattress salesman, and purchasing stunning amounts of pudding.Of course the thing that got this film the most attention was the casting of Adam Sandler. Even before filming began, people thought this was a strange choice, but now we see that director Anderson knew what he was doing.Ebert wrote, ""Sandler, liberated from the constraints of formula, reveals unexpected depths as an actor. Watching this film, you can imagine him in Dennis Hopper roles. He has darkness, obsession and power. He can't go on making those moronic comedies forever, can he?"" Now, this might be too much credit (Sandler and Hopper are still very different), but it is certainly deserved praise.The inspiration of David Phillips and the pudding subplot is incredible, and putting it in the script was genius. Not only because it is a great story, but because the film will long outlast the original story. This film now becomes the story.",Punch-Drunk Love
6,lee_eisenberg,Huh?,5,8 June 2006,"Knowing that Adam Sandler is most associated with goof-ball roles, it was certainly interesting to see him in a movie like ""Punch-Drunk Love"". If only I could have understood the movie better. I realize that it was about a man at the end of his emotional rope finding new strength in a relationship, but it ends there for me. Maybe it was just that the soundtrack seemed a little distracting, but the movie almost looked like the sort of flick that they just made for fun. I guess that after ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", we just expect a lot from Paul Thomas Anderson. Worth seeing, but be prepared for something really far out. Also starring Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman.",Punch-Drunk Love
7,jboothmillard,Punch-Drunk Love,7,6 November 2012,"From director Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood), I spotted this film with the star of Big Daddy and Jack and Jill and was surprised to see that he was in a film from the terrific director and that it was rated well, so I was interested to see what I would think. Basically small business owner Barry Egan (Golden Globe nominated Adam Sandler) runs a company that makes themed toilet plungers and other novelty items, and he has seven sisters who create problems and abuse him emotionally, he has for some time been very lonely and sometimes has fits of rage and he punches something to get rid of it. One morning he has strange things happening in a few moments, he sees a car crash, he picks up a harmonium dropped off in the middle of the street, and English woman Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) comes to see him because she saw his photograph while hanging with his sister Elizabeth (Road Trip's Mary Lynn Rajskub). One night feeling really lonely Barry decides to phone a sex hot-line for a conversation, giving all his address and credit card details to the operator, and being put through to a woman talking dirty, but he simply wants to talk and feel a bit better. The next day he is surprised to hear from this woman on the phone again, and she is asking for his help, saying that she needs money, and he is polite and says that he does not have enough, but she phones again and again demanding it and becoming threatening, so he cancels his card so he will not be charged for his recent hot-line call. He is unaware that the woman, working for mattress store owner Dean Trumbell (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is sending men to collect the money from Barry, and this complicates him getting to know Lena and beginning a relationship, but he is still able to keep up his interest in collecting free air miles, having found that some Healthy Choice pudding labels are incorrect, they advertise a big promotion and he spends little money, he is taking advantage on the mistake. Lena is leaving for a business trip to Hawaii, and to get away from the men coming for him Barry decides to follow her and calling one of his manipulative sisters to get her location, but he eventually finds her and admits he wants a romantic relationship with her. They return home and the four henchman brothers crash their car into Barry's warehouse and mildly injure Lena, and Barry angry gets attacked by them, but he fights them off and puts in Lena in hospital, and meanwhile he calls the hot-line again to talk to the ""supervisor"", and he realises Dean's extortion scheme. He decides to travel to the location he has found out from the phone call, the mattress store in Provo, Utah to confront Dean himself, eventually the extortionist does feel intimidated and forces him to leave him alone, and he returns to Lena to tell her everything and beg her forgiveness for what happened to her. In the end Barry wants to use the frequent-flier miles he has collected to fly with Lena on her future trips abroad, she agrees with this and they are happy to be together, we also see him play the harmonium and she hugs him in happy embrace. Also starring Luis Guzmán as Lance, Lisa Spector as Susan, Julie Hermelin as Kathleen, Karen Hermelin as Anna and Hazel Mailloux as Rhonda. Sandler for once does not play a goofy or not all intelligent character, he is surprisingly dramatic at times, and you can feel for him during the extortion and wanting love, Watson is likable as the English sweetheart who fell for him before meeting in person, and the supporting cast members all get some good moments too, I did laugh at most of the comedy moments, but I was most intrigued by the love story, and perhaps more so by the hot-line plot, the flier miles plot was alright too, it is an unusual romantic comedy drama, but one certainly worth watching. Very good!",Punch-Drunk Love
8,ccthemovieman-1,Know What You're In For Before You See This,8,2 February 2006,"Boy, did this movie disappoint a lot of people.....but not me. The ""disappointed"" were the Adam Sandler fans who expected another ""Happy Gilmore""-type character, the kind of goofball the comedian has built a career on portraying. Instead, they got a dark comedy/drama that was anything but the typical Sandler fare. They also got a weird story.I had the advantage of knowing what to expect, and that helped a lot. Also, I guess I've watched too many movies because I am beginning to like some of these oddball films....and this one certainly qualifies as ""odd."" I thought the mixture of dark humor, drama, suspense and romance all made for a fascinating film. You just never knew what was coming next, something funny or something horrifying. This is definitely something different and I suspect one of those movies you'll either really like or really hate.I supposed it helped I like Emily Watson, who is the female love interest in here. No one that nice would keep seeing a wacko like Sandler's character in here, but that's the movies for you. In most cases, you have to suspend your belief.The storyline, whether pleasant or very unpleasant, got me involved and the camera-work in here was interesting, too. In summary, it's a curiosity piece for those who like something different. Just don't expect a happy, hilarious Happy Gilmore.",Punch-Drunk Love
9,Tweekums,A strange romance,8,21 August 2017,"Barry Egan has seven overbearing sisters, one of whom is trying to set him up with her friend Lena; he isn't so keen. He doesn't realise but he has already met. After a family party, where we see Barry has serious anger issues, he calls a sex-line. He doesn't want phone sex; just somebody to talk to but after giving personal details the woman calls back asking for money. When he refuses she gets nasty. He has his credit card cancels and then her threats start to escalate. While this is going on he meets Lena again and they start to get closer; so much so that he joins her when she goes to Hawaii.Anybody expecting a traditional rom-com may be a little disappointed but those wanting something a little different should really enjoy this. Adam Sandler does a really good job as Barry; an unlikely romantic lead given the character's various personal problem, most notably his explosive temper. There is also something a little surreal about the character as he buys large quantities of pudding because he realises that the air-miles offered on the packs are worth far more than the puddings. Emily Watson does a solid job as Lena, it isn't hard to see why Barry fell for her. Mary Lynn Rajskub impresses as Barry's sister, and Lena's friend, Elizabeth; I was surprised she wasn't further up the cast list as she probably had the third largest part. There may not be obvious gags or witty one-liners but I still found this very funny in places. There is some material that might bother some people; notably a rather violent scene where Barry confronts his tormentors; this is fairly sudden but there is no dwelling on any injuries caused. Overall I'd certainly recommend this; I enjoyed it more than expected.",Punch-Drunk Love
10,moonspinner55,"Its best moments are the smaller, seemingly insignificant ones...",5,3 August 2003,"...but the rest of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is indeed punch drunk, overflowing with ideas that don't connect, don't feel played out, aren't satisfying or are irritating for no particular purpose. The plot about a social question mark who wanders through life before finding love--and almost ruins that for the obstacles that arise from the past--isn't really meaty enough to build 95 minutes of movie on. So much of it is peculiar or off-putting, some scenes ramble without a point and others are cut short. However, Adam Sandler's lead performance pulls you in; he doesn't make you care about this man or his plight necessarily, but he does connect with the audience without much artifice (in other words, he's a natural). The film's conceit is that we're all victims of foolish inconsistencies, but the filmmakers don't make the questions or the answers very clear. It's an obstacle course movie; colorful, perhaps, but inscrutable. ** from ****",Punch-Drunk Love
11,Quinoa1984,As daringly beautiful contemporary pictures get these days,10,18 October 2002,"Punch Drunk Love starts off in the morning, as Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) makes a phone call asking about a Healthy Choice coupons, then walks outside of his business and looks onto an empty street.  He sees one car drive by fast and flip over and get demolished, and then another car drive up on the sidewalk and swiftly drop off a piano/organ, which Sandler takes and runs inside his office and then tries to play it.  Call it bizarre, call it surreal, but this scene is just the icing on the most original dramedy of the year.And most impressive, of course, is Adam Sandler.  I've enjoyed all of his starring, roles, in particular Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, yet I was always wondering when he would dip into another juncture in the acting pool outside of the same perturbed funny-man.  Here in Punch Drunk Love, he is still an enraged soul under a nervy nice guy persona, but director Paul Thomas Anderson realizes that Sandler has a deep meaning to each level, and with his character of Barry Egan, he delivers his best performance to date, so good to be worthy of an Oscar.  P.T. Anderson's story that unfolds after that first scene involves Barry, who has seven condescending sisters, one of them who introduces him to Lela (Emily Watson, also her usual best), who is planning to go to Hawaii.  At first, Barry is hesitant to go, but troubles with a phone sex company stationed in Utah pose new dangers for the man.  Anderson himself is also delivering the goods, topping his long epic Magnolia and going second to Boogie Nights- he has his craft down, and shoots a good lot of the picture like an art cinema film, with striking visuals inter-cutting every now and then. The result is a picture without convention.  While there are slight suggestions that things may turn out all well and dandy in the end, there are always moments when we can't tell what will come out.  Definitely THE film to see this month.  A+",Punch-Drunk Love
12,jotix100,"Give me Jerry Lewis, any day.......",6,30 October 2002,"Is P.T. Anderson trying to tell us that love makes a person stupid? His last film is more accessible, but the casting of Adam Sandler in the moronic role of Barry Egan is something we shall never understand.Anderson is always playing with symbolism and he's at it again here. Thank goodness we didn't get the frogs of Magnolia all over the place as an apocalyptic finale.On a realistic level, has anyone ever known a more stupid person than Barry? I don't think so. What planet does he live in? I mean, hello... Anyone that gives information such as Barry does over the phone deserves all he gets.
Whatever attracted Lena to Barry is for the experts to analyze. A more mismatched pair doesn't come to mind in recent films, except, perhaps, another Adam Sandler film.Poor Emily Watson, after she filmed Red Dragon, she stayed blind, or obviously read another script.With all the hype this film has generated since Cannes, I wouldn't be surprised to see it in many best 10 lists at the end of the year. This doesn't explain the steady exodus of moviegoers I witnessed the day I saw this ""masterpiece"".Better luck next time Mr. Anderson. More symbolism please!",Punch-Drunk Love
13,grantss,Sweet feel-good movie,8,21 March 2014,"Sweet feel-good movie.When this appeared in cinemas I ignored it, simply because it starred Adam Sandler, so I thought it was another mindless slapstick comedy. (I did like ""The Wedding Singer"" though). Subsequently I discovered that it is a romantic-drama, and, as I discovered while watching the DVD, a very good one. A major detour for Adam Sandler, as he plays a serious character, and does so admirably. He plays a weird socially-awkward guy whose life seems sad and meaningless until he meets a woman with similar weirdnesses to his. There is someone for everyone. The notion is not original, but this exploration of it certainly is.",Punch-Drunk Love
14,ferguson-6,Pillow talk and sledgehammers,8,11 November 2002,"Greetings again from the darkness.  How interesting that this movie is receiving high marks from the viewers and poor comments from the reviewers. Thanks to PT Anderson for again pushing the envelope in film and forcing me to think and experience his film.  Hats off to Adam Sandler for taking the first big step towards becoming a leading man in something other than a real-life cartoon (of course, the previews for this film included a trailer for Sandler's upcoming animated feature).  Emily Watson delivers another sterling performance in a role most actresses would never ""get"".  Sandler plays Barry, a self-employed decorative plunger salesman who thanks to his SEVEN overbearing sisters has retreated from life and has only two emotions - numbness and violence.  He wants to change and begins one day by donning a royal blue suit.  Coincidently (or maybe not) this is the same day he witnesses a violent accident, a broken-down harmonium is dropped off by his office, and he meets Emily Watson's character.  Life begins to open up for Barry and the next thing we know, he has followed Emily Watson to Hawaii - sans suitcase.  His raw emotion of joy is something to behold as he exits the plane at the airport.  Director Anderson uses color and light for effect throughout, and I must admit that I have never experienced pillow talk in the Sandler/Watson fashion.  Philip Seymour Hoffman has a nice turn as a scummy Sex Line owner who works from a Mattress Store in Utah (why Utah?). This quirky film is thought provoking and never really lets you get comfortable.  Next step for Adam Sandler - are you an actor or a slap stick comedian?  Don't think you can have it both ways.",Punch-Drunk Love
15,anaconda-40658,Sandler Makes a Masterpiece.,10,16 June 2015,"Punch-Drunk Love (2002): Dir: Paul Thomas Anderson / Cast: Adam Sandler, Emily Watson, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Luis Guzman: Masterpiece about love and confusion and our inability to function under extreme emotional duress. Adam Sandler runs a small business where they specialize in odd items such as designer plungers. He has seven sisters who dominate and abuse his esteem, which leave him sheltered from relationships and reacting with sudden violent outbursts. He seeks refuge in a phone sex hotline where his need for companionship is threatened. Emily Watson plays a mysterious woman who leaves her car at his business. She was introduced through one of his sisters but Sander sees escape from his inner demons. Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who previously made two other masterpieces in Boogie Nights and Magnolia. He uses background music to heighten paranoia. Powerful acting by Sandler who will pursue escape and a sense of self worth. Watson is terrific as she sees through his sisters taunting with mere curiosity. Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals scenes as the hostile phone sex operator, and Mary Lynn Rajskub plays an abusive sister whom Sander must face. Luis Guzman plays Sandler's co-worker who is his one real communication source. Great film about fear, anxiety and resolution and the ability to sober up and function. Score: 10 / 10",Punch-Drunk Love
16,The_Void,Paul Thomas Anderson delivers his best movie to date,9,6 October 2004,"Barry Egan is a downtrodden and respect-less human being. He owns his own business, and he has seven sisters. These seven sisters are the reason why he's so shy; they constantly tease and force him to do things that he doesn't want to do, even in his adult life. They view him with contempt, as a man whom they can just push around, their lapdog; someone that they can call 'gay boy'. As you might expect, Barry doesn't like this life he has, but there's nothing he can do about it, except live with it; and that is something that has lead to all kinds of problems for him, most notably his huge anger problem. Punch-Drunk Love is a love story like no other; the boy-meets-girl theme is still there, but the gloves are off as far as the rest of the genre staples are concerned. Punch-Drunk Love is simultaneously surreal, absurd and hugely intriguing; yet somewhere between the craziness is a story of romance that has the ability to fascinate you and strum your heartstrings at the same time.This film marks a small departure for popular art filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. Unlike the two movies that won him vast acclaim - Magnolia and Boogie Nights, this film focuses it's attention on one character as opposed to an ensemble, and this is a positive thing in my opinion. With just this one character, Anderson is able to open his audience up to him. With the ensemble, the characters got lost somewhat within each other, but by the end of this movie, there is no doubt - you will know Barry Egan. Adam Sandler brings Barry Egan to life, and like with Anderson, this movie marks a departure for him too; although not as big a departure as some might have you believe. If you think about it, this is a typical Sandler character; a fool with an anger problem, only in this movie he's in a different, more arty situation. I'm not a big Sandler hater myself, and I'm pleased that he made this movie as it means that there's finally a film with him in it that's fine for the film buff to like. Emily Watson stars opposite Sandler, and her performance is good, if not magnificent; although really it doesn't need to be, as Sandler is enough to carry the film. Paul Thomas Anderson regulars, Luis Guzmán and Philip Seymour Hoffman also make welcome, if all too short appearances also.Overall, Punch-Drunk Love is a film that will touch, amuse and enthuse you. It's my favourite of Anderson's movies, and that alone should be reason enough for you to see it.",Punch-Drunk Love
17,Mr-Fusion,I don't know that the art-house aspect worked for me . . . but the star certainly does.,7,26 April 2017,"Right from the start, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" paints its main character as somewhat off; fidgety, awkward, pacing like a caged animal and just barely repressing an innate rage. And it doesn't take long to see that this guy's on the losing side of life. At a certain point, you find yourself rooting for him just to catch a break. And that's a long road because it's just one misfortune after another. It's for that reason that I wasn't as taken with the movie as the hype would let on. But it's Adam Sandler playing this character, and that alone is impressive. It's not that I'm Sandler-averse, but he's been playing the same role for decades. This is a refreshing performance, both vulnerable and unstable. Philip Seymour Hoffman handily steals his scenes, but it's easy to see why Sandler surprised everyone here. It could all just come down to having the right director, but even still, the man's deserving of just praise. 7/10",Punch-Drunk Love
18,christopher-underwood,not comfortable viewing at all,7,17 November 2018,"It has been suggested that this film is less one to enjoy, than to be felt. However, when I last saw this some fifteen years ago, I do remember enjoying it. I was stunned by the sound and colour, by the seeming random acts and the surreal feel. This time around I'm rather bothered by the sound, disorientated by the sudden falls of packaging and Sandler bursting into tears. This time I do not feel comfortable or happy at all. Sandler and Watson work well enough together but more like two children thrown together at their parents instigation that a meeting of minds. More a desperate union of need. No not comfortable viewing at all, nor very involving, there is no compulsion to get involved. They may have been the products of dysfunctional families but they now exist in backstreets and warehouses and surely the ugliest bit of Hawaii. I'm not saying the film is not well made, just that it is not for me, just now.",Punch-Drunk Love

20,=G=,A different kind of romcom,7,27 June 2003,"In ""Punch Drunk Love"" Sandler plays an oddball who is busy with his ""plumber's friend"" business, cries a lot, doesn't know if he's gay, and is generally good natured with the exception of sudden destructive outbursts. Then Watson enters his life, they fall in love, and he gets....um, normal...sort of. That's the gist of this little romcom which seems to thrive on being different and is surprisingly fresh and entertaining albeit unconventional to a fault. Not for everyone but scoring well with critics and the public at large, ""PDL"" is a love it or hate it kind of flick and the only way to know if you're going to enjoy it is to watch it. (B)",Punch-Drunk Love
21,MovieAddict2016,"This movie isn't exactly ""When Harry Met Sally...""",10,2 July 2003,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a lot of things. It's the change of direction for an actor. It's the change of acting for a director. It's odd, demented, and strangely entertaining. It could be called a form of art, which it probably is. It is good, but not particularly great.Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a lonely, sad man with seven sisters. Barry has violent outbursts sometimes, and the most likely reason is because of the way his sisters treat him. Barry admits that he doesn't know if he's normal or not because he doesn't know how most people are. One day he meets Lena (Emily Watson), and they go out to dinner. Barry starts to fall in love, but trouble starts when furniture outlet owner Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sends out four blond brothers to get money from Barry. Why? Because Barry called a phone sex line the night before and gave out his private information. Now Barry must protect Lena and show Dean who he's messing with.""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a really weird movie. Think ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Magnolia"" and ""Happy Gilmore."" Barry Egan is a rage-oholic, just like Sandler's other character Happy Gilmore from the said movie. As you probably well know, ""Happy Gilmore"" is about a hockey-player who becomes a golf player, and beats up a lot of people in the process. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" runs in somewhat the same veins. In one scene, when Barry and Lena are eating dinner, Lena tells Barry that his sister told her a story about Barry throwing a hammer through a glass door, and Barry excuses himself, goes into the bathroom, and tears it apart, destroying it limb from...toilet paper holder. The biggest thing I heard about this movie was how good Adam Sandler was in his role. Many who dismissed his comedies praised him here. I always enjoyed his comedies (most of them, anyway), so I didn't have any reservations about admitting Sandler did a fine job, which he did. His character is quiet, loney. He tells a dentist in once scene, ""I don't like myself very much."" There's a different side to this Sandler; he's not as cocky and self-assured as he was in, say, ""Happy Gilmore"" or ""Billy Madison."" He's different. Maybe too different for his fans. When he finally confronts Dean at the end of the film, he says, ""I have love in my life, and it makes me stronger than anything you could ever imagine."" If someone approached you a year ago and placed a bet that Adam Sandler would ever treat women with respect in a movie of his, I bet you'd counter it. But I guess strange things happen. The entire film is very odd. There's a Charlie Kaufman vibe running through this movie. Paul Thomas Anderson - P.T. Anderson to his fans - brought us ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" ""Boogie Nights"" clocked in at about two and a half hours, ""Magnolia"" at three +. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is eighty-eight minutes. This might be the sign of a talented director changing courses, or a talented director taking a break from his more weighty motion pictures. Whatever the sign, the film is a bit too wacky and never really explains things like it should. But it's a fine film to watch, and there's nothing particularly awful about it. I found myself liking it more than I thought I would after seeing the trailer. Besides, it's probably the only time you'll ever watch a romantic film where the star-struck lovers say, ""I love you so much I could smash your face in with a sledgehammer."" This movie isn't exactly ""When Harry Met Sally...""3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",Punch-Drunk Love
22,thesar-2,Pudding Drunkless,5,24 July 2015,"On the plus side, I didn't hate Sandler in this. On the downside, I still have almost zero clue to what I just watched.Not being an Adam Sandler fan whatsoever, I must've been recommended this movie over three dozen times. I knew nothing of it, other than it was supposed to be dramatic for the usually comedic actor, à la Jim Carrey's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Oscar-bait and the poster for him in his blue suit. To me, this is a good thing. I love recommendations and going into them stone-cold. My two pre-viewing assumptions were: this was about a drunk dealing with his alcoholism and I'll probably and finally love an Adam Sandler movie.I was wrong on both preconceived premonitions. I didn't love it at all. I mean, it was okay. It was well shot, original and Adam finally showed some depth, though not too much. And not once did I see anyone drunk, or drinking at all. Oh, well. That was just my bad while thinking of the title.But, speaking of premonitions, this might have been his, in regards to his character's anger management problems and Sandler's Anger Management film coming out the year following.Normally, I try to do some kind of as-much-as-I-can spoiler-free synopsis, but, again, I barely remember anything I just saw. (Very) Bothered Businessman (??) Barry, brother of seven sisters, gets caught up in both a phone-sex scandal and real love from an admirer/stalker. Oh, and Barry likes to punch a lot, which leads us back to the title, despite no alcohol involved.Maybe there's some deeper meaning I missed. Maybe a look into depression, a need for help or frequent flyer miles are harder to swallow. I don't know, as our lead keeps saying. I had a feeling this was well made with good intentions AND I actually didn't mind Sander for onceso I give it a dead-even 5/10 stars. Nothing to ever see again, but hey, I'm glad I crossed it off my list, finally.",Punch-Drunk Love
23,cherold,soooo depressing,4,26 May 2004,"I was really looking forward to this movie.  I had the impression it would be quirky and original and Sandler proved in the Wedding Singer that he was actually capable of giving a good performance in a good movie (although it's not something he generally even tries for).So, it is certainly quirky, kind of original and Sandler gives a very interesting performance.  But the movie just made me depressed, anxious and uncomfortable.  This guy has an awful life, the film is claustrophobic and and you feel that he is totally trapped; by his intrusive sisters, by the over-the-top subplot involving phone sex, but most of all by his own rage and helplessness.  I gave up on this movie about two thirds of the way through, because you're just watching a doomed man.  None of it is funny, in spite of being quirky, and while the movie may well have a happy ending for all I know, there's no way that character could have a happy ending without years and years of therapy, at the least.  You could take this same character and situation and make a dark, searing drama, but instead the movie is sort of a comedy without laughs, something that shies away from the real results of populating it with misery.  It's a complete misfire.",Punch-Drunk Love

25,paul2001sw-1,What was that?,4,25 August 2014,"With his 2002 movie 'Punch Drunk Love', director Paul Thomas Anderson, known for his epic films 'Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia', and 'There Will be Blood', rather surprisingly turned his attention to romantic comedy. In theory, this was bold and promising, certainly to someone like myself who finds the standard by-the-book Hollywood romance insufferable. But having seen the film, it's hard to remain convinced. Adam Sandler plays a man with serious social limitations, with whom an attractive woman inexplicably falls in love, only for his happiness to be threatened by his prior use of a telephone sex line. The characterisation is jerky and uneven: Sandler never plays normal, but gyrates between autistic and irrational for no reason. Meanwhile, there's a quirky, intrusive soundtrack, deliberately odd backdrops, and random thematic motifs. Ultimately, I can't see who this film is supposed to appeal to, with its absence of realism, sweetness or any basis sense: an odd entry indeed in Anderson's otherwise fine career.",Punch-Drunk Love
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A bizarre alternate romance that's oddly unsettling and surprisingly endearing.,8,6 August 2018,"'Punch-Drunk Love (2002)' is a bizarre little movie about a lonely, damaged man just trying to live his life to its newfound fullest potential - thanks to the jarring introduction of a calming harpsichord and a woman beautifully unlike his sisters - while everything else spirals out of control and each disparate yet equally dysfunctional element smashes into one another at maximum velocity, causing both the protagonist and audience extreme anxiety (helped enormously by the fantastic camera-work, editing - or, sometimes, lack thereof - and percussion-based score). Ultimately, this all seems like just a glimpse into the daily struggles of a guy who seems downright decent if you dig just below the surface, below the outbursts of extreme anger and violence and the barely-there facade put on just to maintain the socially-required illusion that 'everything's okay' even if it really isn't. There's a profundity and an optimism beneath the generally uncomfortable vibe, given off due to an unsteady - yet, purposefully so - tone and a sense of pseudo absurdism just in the sheer 'randomness' of it all (though, thus is life), but both aspects are paramount in its success because it ends up feeling oddly honest, especially in its portrayal of a possibly mentally ill but definitely extremely sad and lonely social-outcast, and also strangely heartfelt, essentially saying that no-one is out of love's reach and that everyone has someone they're meant to be with no matter who they are or what their 'problems' may be. The flick never shies away from its pulpiest of elements, either. At times, it even feels like an art-house thriller, with an excellent sense of suspense and tension. In itself, it almost feels like the 'outcast' of romance movies, sending out the same soppy message but in an entirely different package. It's actually incredibly endearing, despite being strangely unsettling. It's also oddly entertaining even at its most frustrating. It really is excitingly unique stuff. 8/10",Punch-Drunk Love
27,gbill-74877,Interesting themes and performances,7,24 March 2020,"A film that remained tantalizingly just out of reach for me for a real connection, despite its themes of guilt, awkwardness, trying to escape one's childhood, self-loathing, and the anger issues of the main character, played well by Adam Sandler. Some interesting characters, some interesting surreal bits, and some interesting performances - Sandler running almost like a modern day Chaplin and Phillip Seymour Hoffman screaming come to mind - but it didn't quite gel together or go as deep as I would have liked it to. It's original and I love Sandler branching out and doing this kind of film in 2002 though.",Punch-Drunk Love
28,g-bodyl,Love It or Hate It Film!,8,1 April 2014,"As with most Paul Thomas Anderson's films, you can either love them or hate them. The same goes for this film, Punch-Drunk Love. I can't say I loved this film, but I did not hate the film despite me hating the first fifteen minutes. This seems to be more of a cinematic experiment and it works to a degree. Once I got used to the tone and emptiness of the film, I could see lots of artistic beauty at it's core. This is a romantic comedy, but perhaps not one of those clichéd ones and that I'm thankful for.Anderson's film is about a socially-awkward guy named Barry Egan who doesn't live much of a life and is constantly harangued by his sisters. But once he meets Lena, he begins to fall in love with her and starts to find out who he really is.This is a different role that what most people are accustomed to Adam Sandler playing. This is more of a dark comedy and Sandler nails this role down. I didn't like his performance at first, but it's something you have to adjust to. The other performances by Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman are excellent.Overall, this is an interesting cinematic experience. I can't say I liked this film much, but I was certainly entranced by it. It's a small film and an obvious experiment. It can be funny, charming, and even violent at times. I wanted to hate this film, but I couldn't. Not with all this artistic beauty here. Leave it to Paul Thomas Anderson to make an interesting film like this. One way or the other, it's a love it or hate it film. I rate this film 8/10.",Punch-Drunk Love
29,cricketbat,Somewhat disorienting,5,11 October 2018,"Seeing as how Punch-Drunk Love was my first experience with a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, it was quite the experience. This movie is somewhat disorienting and it takes some time to get your bearings. Luckily, I had a friend to help guide me through it. I liked this film, but it may require another viewing before I can truly appreciate it.",Punch-Drunk Love
30,lesleyharris30,"Don't Really Get this Movies Appeal,",10,23 August 2014,"Punch-Drunk Love is a mediocre movie with a messy storyline and a decent cast.I was really looking forward to seeing this because everyone tells me it's a career changing movie for Adam Sandler,and while I will admit it is nothing like what he has done before,I don't see whats so good about this movie,the camera work looks really cheap and I don't find most of the scenes very funny,as well as that,they try to tell a love story while doing a really comedic one at the same time,and when I felt like the movie was coming to an end it felt like neither of those stories were properly wrapped up.Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance was great and he was certainly the highlight of this movie,I didn't know he was in this and when I saw him it was an absolute breath of fresh air,Sandlers character was funny at times but I was mostly just annoyed by him.Punch-Drunk Love is considered brilliant to many people,but honestly I don't what it is that makes it so good,it is unique but not in a way you'd want it to be,and I honestly wouldn't recommend it. A man is starting a love life he never thought he'd have,while he is also being blackmailed by a telephone service he rang one night. Best Performance: Philip Seymour Hoffman",Punch-Drunk Love
31,Irishchatter,Ehhh alright i suppose!,5,21 March 2016,"I wouldn't call this one of Sandlers best movies, sure he rarely has any best movies. Anyways he actually had a serious role in this one, he's not like the loud mouth dope who you would always see in most of his films! He appeared to be like this passive aggressive guy who has a pretty rough life. Christ, it is annoying when your 7 siblings are being so bossy and it was even scary that the caller girl was actually a criminal in the end.Actually at the end of the film, I thought Sandlers character would beat up the bad guys but it seemed they both backed out. I would've loved to have seen himself and Seymour Hoffman doing kung-fu at each other haha!Even though Emily Watson is a good actress and has a lovely voice, i just didn't think they were a good match for each other. I know this is meant to be pretend but still, they really should've gotten a better woman for him to be his love interest.",Punch-Drunk Love
32,atlasmb,Avant Garde meets Surreal in a film about the Psychology of Individuals,6,26 March 2014,"For almost every film reviewed you get diametrically opposed opinions. It is totally no surprise that this film elicits extremes in opinions.First of all, the entire film revolves around one character (Barry, played by Adam Sandler) who has mental issues, which is to say that his grasp on reality is tenuous. He is very aware of that, so he is very self-conscious at all times. If you know you do not see the world the way most ""normal"" people do, but you wish you did, you constantly try to understand what is different between your world view and theirs. This is a nearly impossible task, because the ""language"" of your brain is different from theirs.To convey Barry's view of the world, the director uses various techniques: unusual camera actions, unusual views, the interjection of colors (seemingly to express moods), and background sounds and music. These can be disquieting for the viewer, but they attempt to make the viewer understand how incongruous the world must be for someone like Barry.Adam Sandler does a good job with his part. It takes a while to assemble some of the director's cues and piece together an understanding of Barry, but Sandler is consistent in his performance, making it easier.The film seems to raise a lot of questions in viewers: how neurotic is Barry? What will happen to him after the film ends? Can Barry nurture a real love in his life? After watching the film, my first response was that I did not get much from it emotionally. But these questions are worth asking. And no matter how sad or happy you are for Barry, it is good to consider how the alternate realities for people affect their actions and those around them.I have no idea why the director included certain elements in the film, e.g. the appearance of tractor-trailers. But like some poetry, it is not important that we understand every element. We are allowed to take what we will from the work.For me personally, I did not find this film as satisfying as some other films by the director. But that is okay. I am glad I saw it. At least it was not as bizarre (in my opinion) as ""The Naked Lunch"", for example.",Punch-Drunk Love
33,tabuno,What No Oscar Nominations?,9,25 January 2019,"25 August 2003. The surprise of 2002 movie season could probably be called, ""What? No Oscar nominations for Punch-Drunk Love?""This movie is the surrealistic, American classic of today's love story. The music selections, Adam Sandler's break out dramatic performance captured the script perfectly. The whole cinematography was richly presented with original perspectives, timed shoots, and a lavish dramatic shoot. The creative personal characterization of Barry Egan is a fabulous presentation of a well crafted, unique personality. Philip Seymour Hoffman gets to play an off-beat role that breaks away from his usual character roles of odd-ball, light weight comedic.This charming love story is a contemporary American classic...the new wave in American cinema. Adam Sandler has made a bold statement in American motion pictures opposite the consummate actress - Emily Watson. Nine out of Ten Stars.",Punch-Drunk Love
34,tomgillespie2002,The Sandler persona done sweet and sympathetic,9,30 December 2017,"When asked what his next project would be following the success of his L.A. ensemble one-two of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson responded that he would be making an Adam Sandler movie. He was met with a hearty chuckle by whoever was interviewing him, but little did they know that a comedy starring most people's - at least I would hope - least favourite comedy star was actually on the cards. Punch-Drunk Love ended up taking home the Best Director award at the Cannes Film Festival, but was undoubtedly Anderson's most divisive film. Surprisingly short and often incredibly weird, the film has garnered more and more respect and appreciation amongst fans and critics over the last 15 years, and many now even consider it to be the director's best work in a catalogue that includes the likes of There Will Be Blood and The Master.Punch-Drunk Love revolves around Barry Egan (Sandler), a troubled and socially-awkward salesman of toilet plungers and various other novelty items. Forever bedecked in a blue suit and red tie combination, Barry tries to keep to himself while harbouring a hatred for his inability to be 'normal', but his seven hen-pecking and overbearing sisters are constantly trying to 'bring him out of his shell'. Whenever his sisters mention the way they treated him as a child, he responds in a fit of rage. A family party is brought to a swift end when he kicks through patio doors after being reminded of a particularly cruel childhood nickname. He finds solace in a harmonium he finds dumped outside his work's warehouse, and eventually in an English woman named Lena (Emily Watson) introduced to him by his sister Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub). They like each other straight away, but she travels a lot, so Barry starts to take full advantage of a marketing loop-hole that will grant him a lifetime of air miles through purchasing mass quantities of cheap pudding.Anderson is apparently fond of Sandler's work, so he obviously sees something in the actor whose success has left many of us befuddled. Sandler typically plays the same person: The childish slacker who is a nice guy deep down, but prone to outbursts of rage. He plays very much the same here, only he is likeable and sympathetic, delivering his best performance to date. When he isn't smashing up a restaurant toilet or bruising his hand on his office wall, Sandler is remarkably subtle, mixing up his words in a nervous tic and struggling to meet people's gaze. In his loneliness, Barry phones a sex-line and ends up on the receiving end of a blackmail scheme run by scumbag mattress-store owner Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman). It's all over the place in terms of plot, but Punch-Drunk Love is very much a character piece built around a troubled yet fascinating man finally finding love in the chaos of his life and his own mind. It's an acquired taste, but far more accessible than some of Anderson's later work, especially The Master and Inherent Vice. We probably all know a Barry but have likely kept our distance, but Punch-Drunk Love is brave enough to place him front and centre, lending a voice to the type of introvert misunderstood and viewed with suspicion by most.",Punch-Drunk Love
35,Floated2,Different Side of Sandler,7,4 July 2017,"Punch-Drunk Love is a relatively different Adam Sandler, mainly because it isn't typically an ""Adam Sandler"" film in which people would say. It isn't his Happy Gilmore company production in which he has had in past comedies, so it could be labeled more of a Paul Thomas Anderson film just with Sandler starring. This film is widely considered to be the best or one of the best films starring Adam Sandler as he is portraying somewhat of a different character in a different tone of a film. Not so much a wacky or silly toilet humor comedy in which he has done, but a more mature dark comedy with sides of serious drama and comedy here and there.Punch-Drunk Love is an odd comedy which can be described as a romantic comedy and dark comedy, as it contains both elements. The film is quite different and not predictable at times which is why it works. Although very short in run time, it could have developed another layer of story but that's fine. Maybe a little overrated due to hatred of Sandler, in which people claim this is his only great dramatic film or great performance, but nonetheless Punch-Drunk Love appears to be the film which non-Sandler fans like or praises the most.",Punch-Drunk Love
36,eddie_baggins,A bizarre and unique black comedy,7,2 November 2021,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson's oft-spoken about career, there's a film in his catalogue that never gets the mentions or plaudits the likes of Boogie Nights, There Will be Blood and The Master get, that film is 2002's Punch-Drunk Love.A collaboration with comedian Adam Sandler, who at the time was still busy making low-brow comedies and finally proved he was more than Rob Schneider's friend and golf with his performance here as the socially awkward and confused Barry Egan, Love is very much Anderson commanding a pitch black comedy like Boogie Nights and Inherent Vice, as Barry goes about collecting packs of frequent flyer puddings, calling questionable phone lines and trying to work out a new found potential romance with Emily Watson's Lena.It's a slight film, very much a character driven escapade rather than an incident driven one, with a highlight of spectacle a worried Egan running from some low level criminals through the backstreets, Love is an awkward little film about awkward little people but there's also a heart and soul to this tale of a wounded soul that shows a softer side to both Sandler and Anderson as we can't help but wish the best for Barry as his personal crisis reaches a tipping point full of smashed windows, quick trips to Hawaii and restaurant restroom meltdowns.As is always the case with an Anderson film, the performances of his core cast are all of the highest order, with Sandler up there with the best his been before or since while Watson, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman and the always enjoyable Luis Guzman getting their time to shine in a small-scale film that is wonderfully shot by D. O. P Robert Elswit, creating a dreamlike/nightmarish like vision of Barry's life that is struggling to stay on the tracks.Almost twenty years ahead of the much lauded Sandler hit Uncut Gems, watching Love now makes one think these two films are perfectly suited to a double bill of tension rattling escapades with Sandler front and center as a crumbling man trying to keep his head above water in seemingly insurmountable odds, with both efforts proving Sandler is much more than we often get from the laconic figure who often gets far too comfortable going for the lowest hanging fruit when he could be pushing himself to be more than what audiences expect from the well-liked figure.Final Say -A curious little film that never reaches for anything grand but creates a unique and often charming off-kilter affair, Punch-Drunk Love isn't high class Anderson but it's an effort worthy of re-watch or first time viewing all the same.3 1/2 boxes of pudding out of 5.",Punch-Drunk Love
37,johnnyboyz,"Anderson redeems himself, while Sandler pops up in something that's well worth watching.",7,19 May 2013,"Shorter; sweeter; more focused and much more involving, Punch Drunk Love is the concentrated opus of director Paul Thomas Anderson that should spring to mind ahead of previous effort Magnolia when his name is uttered. The film, something that zeroes in this time on one person and the masses with which he comes to interact rather than the masses coming to interact with one other, is a blackly amusing; darkly toned and meticulously unfolded drama. It is tough to know what to make of the film and that is a far cry from Anderson's aforementioned 1999 effort, which set itself up to be this ponderous; god awful mess within about forty five minutes before sticking true to its guns.The film is a goofy, charming little piece which happens to tread some grim territory although all in good stead. There is an early scene, after having witnessed the lead bombarded by telephone calls by some siblings, in which said lead answers with an unnaturally large number upon being asked facetiously how many sisters they have. You could be forgiven for mistaking it for sarcasm, but there is a truth behind the wry delivery of the digit; a subtle, disturbed genuineness behind how the admittance to such a thing sounds like admittance to defeat – such is the film's nature; such is the film's rash, clawing and tragic authenticity.Stuck half way between delivering a low-rent, urban set drama about one man living alone who's stuck in a spiral of life wherein little goes his way and a more explorative, more audacious avant-garde piece, Anderson's film depicts a clerk by the name of Barry Egan (Sandler) who runs his own small business in California. Egan spends his day at this work dwarfed by a large, mostly empty, emporium in a retail park just off a main road. He fends off his sisters who badger him over the phone; absorbs slights from his Mexican employees and struggles to make sense of seemingly random happenings out on the street in the form of automobile accidents nobody seems to worry about and grand pianos being left perched on the pavement.Beyond this space, he is lost in a sea of bright white light at a convenience store – a store swamping him with deals and offers amidst the obscure Gursky-esque picture compositions thus causing him to lose track of what he even wanted in the first place. We sense that Egan can just about float his life, never mind a company. Sandler's character is one of a lonely ilk, and there is a wry sadness when his attempts to provide a business cohort his personal number fail. Things pick up in this regard when Emily Watson's Lena Leonard walks into his vicinity, a woman with whom the initial interactions are of course awkward but a woman whose presence grows in his life as the love story-to-be resists playing its hand quite yet.The small matter of the immediate loneliness is quashed by a solution Egan discovers in phone sex hot-lines. This is a sub-plot which escalates into a scam involving a heavy metal enthusiast played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who operates nearby and who eventually complicates Egan's life further in his sending of hired muscle to take money from Egan. With Lena in Egan's life, the man is suddenly granted something to lose; something to work towards keeping and something which appears to stabilise his existence. Watson's character takes him to fresh pastures and introduces him to new things; she intensifies his emotions and escalates his reactions in comparison to what might have been. One could fit Punch Drunk Love into Magnolia something like three times over, and yet I wouldn't trade a frame from this film for an hour of that one. There is an elegance to what happens here, a sad; poetic and often angry elegance which immerses you with its unpredictability and its depiction of a world from a shattered, bullied perspective. Regardless of what comes to mind when contemplating watching an Adam Sandler film, take the time to see this one.",Punch-Drunk Love
38,Petey-10,Comedy and tragedy combine,9,27 April 2006,"Adam Sandler plays somewhat an eccentric man who has an obsession with pudding.He has seven sisters who are the reason he loses his nerve once in a while.He's a lonely man and has never been loved.Then one day a lady named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) enters his life.Punch-Drunk Love (2002) is a very fine movie from Paul Thomas Anderson.It has some comedy and drama that are very well balanced in the movie.It's a movie that can sometimes make you cry and sometimes make you laugh.Sandler's character is a very tragical man.There's a scene where he starts to cry.It's hard to hold your tears during that scene.This movie proves that Adam Sandler can act when he puts some effort.There are other great actors in the movie.Watson does a terrific job.So do Philip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, Mary Lynn Rajskub and so on.This is a movie I truly recommend.There comedy meets tragedy as it often does in life",Punch-Drunk Love
39,TheMovieDiorama,Punch-Drunk Love chaotically delights with its offbeat obsession and unembellished romance.,9,30 April 2020,"Barry, a blue-suited entrepreneur, precariously works in his spacious warehouse, selling a variety of novelty items for high mark-up. The walls accentuating his attire with additional cold shades of blue. The vast emptiness surrounding his miniature office space. The recently stacked up cases of puddings, attached with an exploitative promotion to earn millions of frequent flyer miles. One day, Barry wanders outside, sipping on his premium reflective flask. Suddenly, an inexplicable car crash emerges from the main road. With no time to process, a passing vehicle then drops off a dilapidated harmonium by his professional footwear. He acts. Running back to his warehouse grasping at the splintered edges of the ""small piano"". Swiftly, a woman nervously approaches Barry, Lena, whom happens to be a co-worker to one of his seven intrusively emotionally abusing sisters. A tepid romance begins to blossom, where Barry soon confronts his social incapacities during his first chance for love.Anderson's romantic comedy is unlike any clichéd love story that saturates the accessible genre. First and foremost, it's an authentic character study. Barry is plagued with severe social anxiety, a mental manifestation of years of emotional childhood abuse, when his siblings would unnecessarily call him ""gay boy"" and overbear him with personal questions. A side-effect of this is a profound loneliness that weighs on his optimistic shoulders. Anchoring him down, leading to the employment of brash coping mechanisms such as awkwardly phoning up chatline operators to initiate a conversation. His persona punctuated by uncontrollable fits of rage whenever anything agitates Barry to an extreme degree, from obliterating a restaurant bathroom to shattering his sister's windows. These psychological tendencies are sublimely meshed together through Anderson's acute direction and sparse screenplay, enabling a hugely relatable character study to form. Emotional isolation is a tangible mental affliction, that more often than not, many viewers have experienced. To coincide that strong characterisation with a blossoming romance to which the other individual understands from a sentimental perspective, well, it instantly captivates. Why? Because it is relatable. They immediately fall in love, but it works effectively due to Barry's inexperience with socialisation. He is unaware of the emerging feelings within, and struggles to cope with this newfound emotion. Therefore, instantly claiming ""love"" feels wholesomely convincing, in what is usually a superfluous claim for rapid plot progression.Barry's complexities and simplicities were expertly conveyed by a career-best performance in Sandler. Anderson intelligently touches upon his typical goofy comedic abilities, yet manages to nuance them with an empathetic undertone, to which Sandler sublimely emphasises through doe-eyed adornment. The bursts of rage, the tender romanticism and the entrepreneurial spirit all felt strengthened by his subtly visual performance. Watson was just as palpable portraying Lena, harnessing a complexity of her own as she shares a underdeveloped fixation with Barry.Anderson however, remains as the shining star amongst all of his films. His direction, unsurprisingly, was faultless. Absolutely perfect. He somehow managed to merge the psychological character of Barry, with the romanticism of Lena and the noir thrills of the chatline extortion sub-plot. All eventually colliding with one another to challenge Barry's recently discovered freedom from loneliness. He bravely stood up for himself, and his new love. Sweet, sweet perfection! Yet it's Anderson's orchestration of events that culminate in an absorbing drama. Elswit's gorgeous cinematography that embedded vivid colourisation throughout to perpetuate character emotions, particularly blue (sad, loneliness) and red (love, anger). Brion's initially chaotic score, matching that of Barry's invaded mindset, slowly diminishing into jaunty romanticism when Barry courageously flies to Hawaii for Lena. Again, perfectly perpetuating the emotionality of its characters. Silhouettes, uncentered camera shots, lens flares, arduous long takes, Blake's visually stunning video interludes, and so much more! It's a smorgasbord of technical astuteness that, in itself, harks back to classic romance films of the 60s and 70s, whilst still embodying a contemporary aesthetic.All constructed within the boundaries of a minuscule ninety minute runtime. An impressive achievement, that may have just lost its impact towards the inevitable rushed ending. Lena hospitalised, Barry confronting the chatline ""supervisor"" and then rampantly attempting to attain that ""happily ever after"" sequence, may have resulted in a more succinct impression had Anderson not insisted on such a restricted runtime. That overbearing criticism of the deservedly talented Hoffman waiting out on the sidelines does loom over.Fortunately though, Punch-Drunk Love does not revolve around ""The Mattress Man"". It strictly revolves around Barry. A regular human being, like you and I. Facing the plethora of emotional obstacles that life throws at his feet, much like the harmonium. Eventually, a shining beacon of light will enter the imprisoned mentality of loneliness. Allowing him to escape the overburdening anxiety through the power of love and affection. Isn't that the greatest love story of them all?",Punch-Drunk Love
40,insomniac_rod,Dark and intriguing. Not for all audiences.,7,10 May 2010,"I really had high expectations. I recognize Anderson's movies as creative, clever, entertaining, and best of all, original.I don't know, but this movie made me feel depressed (in some aspects I felt related to the lead character, that should give you an idea). At other points it made me laugh, then it made me feel uncomfortable, and finally it made me feel calmed down because the resolution was perfect.This one had the ingredients to be considered as a ""different"" movie. I mean, it has Adam Sandler in a serious ""art-house"" role, a strange but interesting plot, weird situations, nice supporting cast (Luis Guzmán is the man!), and a great soundtrack.I can say I was satisfied only 50%. Sure, I enjoyed the acting and the dialogs. Loved the whole phone sex conversation. The hints towards Sandler's character's illness or disorder are very intriguing and force the audience to generate an opinion. I think he's bipolar but that's my opinion.The soundtrack is excellent. Most of the songs used on important situations fit perfectly and add something special to the movie's dark vibe.Phillip Seymour Hoffman was great in his small role. The man knows how to yell! Excellent actor. Emmy Watson is a really talented actress. His verbal fight with Sandler was great.The Direction is top notch. Loved the one-take scenes where the camera made you focus on static views and suddenly something happened (the car crash for example).Overall, this is a movie to watch for those who want to take a break from Hollywood's conventionalism.",Punch-Drunk Love
41,jzappa,A Love Letter To Paul Thomas Anderson's Film Form,10,10 September 2008,"Bestowed with a director and a screenplay that sees through the Adam Sandler persona, that recognizes it as the masquerade of a tormented outcast, Sandler brings to light profundity and intensity that could possibly have been the potential reach of misnomers like Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy. The unwavering born mastery of Paul Thomas Anderson draws out a beautiful romantic film on the groove teetering between comedy and drama, a movie about a magical endowment of confidence upon a man afflicted with an anxious lack of such.Anderson's impeccably shot and edited picture is enlivening to experience because Sandler, unshackled from the constriction of formula in the movies over which he has creative control, divulges personal shadows, fixation and might. The world of Punch Drunk Love is perceived surrealistically through his socially crippled character's discernment, and thus is barricaded with a certain obscurity and difficulty.I stroke the freethinking enlightenment of movies in which I am entirely devoid of any hint as to the event that will succeed the present one. What is so amazing about Anderson as a filmmaker is his autodidactic climb to the director's chair and, likewise, to the keyboard. He enrolled at the NYU film school for two days before leaving, reobtaining his tuition and using it to make a short film on his own. During a screen writing course, he turned in a script by David Mamet and immediately left after receiving a C+ on it. These experiences, especially considering his success, served more as testaments to his innate gift as a contemporary architect of the fine art of cinema. His scenes of confrontation, silent or stoically chaotic, are always unpredictable, and they result in a fresh, effectual progression of a provocative film. In Punch Drunk Love, it is Sandler's abrupt, injurious rage, the undercurrent of every scene. The hidden tension is a wild ride even before Sandler attempts to achieve comfort by calling a phone sex hotline, but the girl then makes an effort to extort money from him and sends her four hooligan brothers after him.Anderson bathes the screen in romantic colors whose spirit remains even with natural shadow appears. The movement of his camera is smooth, precise, loving and patient. He fills the soundtrack with lush orchestrations and dainty old-time slow ballads. My love of watching this movie does not thoroughly coincide with my appreciation for its story and Sandler's audacious performance; it is more for the soothing grace of Anderson's technical production quality, his slow and steady pace given to a relatively short film. No one has had such stylistic virtuosity since Scorsese.",Punch-Drunk Love
42,dee.reid,Adam Sandler has finally grown up!,10,1 March 2007,"Yes, it's true, and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is that good. While nobody really wants to admit it, I do sense some real genius in the comedy of Adam Sandler, despite the childish hi-jinks and humor. He's like a kid who wants to grow up but just isn't ready to assume the responsibilities of adulthood. Here, in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" Sandler was able to do the impossible for the film community: give a great acting performance as Barry Egan, the owner of a small novelty plunger business who is bossed around by his seven dominating sisters. When a chance meeting with a mysterious woman named Lena (Emily Watson) tosses him head-on into the trials & tribulations of first love, behold, it's a glorious day for Barry Egan. But all is not right with Barry, as our first moments with him lead us to believe. As it turns out, he has some severe emotional issues and when he gets p***ed, he often lashes out in a violent frenzy and when this happens, objects (especially anything made of glass) are just things in the path of a raging bull. To top it off, he's being conned by a phone-sex company (run by a perfectly slimy Philip Seymour Hoffman), and he has plans to crank up his frequent-flier miles by buying packs of chocolate pudding after finding a mathematical loophole in a sweepstakes advertisement (there is an interesting little scene where all of this is explained). I'll admit that I'm no fan of Silicon Valley's premier writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (not to be confused with Britain's Paul W. S. Anderson), but his work here is simply astounding, with its performances and visual appeal (there are many pretty colors here). He handles his performers quite competently, in what could have been a typical romantic comedy. The center character here, is Sandler, who received a Golden Globe nomination for his work (and sadly, he really hasn't been able to do anything that's captured that sort of positive attention since). I am a huge Sandler fan myself, even though this is a little late. I was disappointed around the time of this film's release by hearing some of the asinine things his ""fans"" were saying when they found out he gave a real acting performance with a well-rounded character. Anderson's creation, Barry Egan, is something that suited Sandler very well, giving him a perfect outlet to counter the childish characters he's played so well in the past. So in essence, that former ""big kid"" Adam Sander has now grown up into an adult.10/10",Punch-Drunk Love
43,meeza,"Punched in a ""10"" for this one",10,31 October 2002,"Director Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered another fascinating film in `Punch-Drunk Love'. It is simply one of the best films of the year. No! It is not about two alcoholics in a bar fighting over a woman. This quirky gem is about a toilet plunger salesman who unexpectedly encounters romance with an enchanting businesswoman. However, anyone who has watched a P.T. Anderson film knows that the plot is not the thriving force of P.T. films, but instead it's the character development & the unexpected coincidences which are the signature designs of his works of cinematic art. `Punch-Drunk Love' is reminiscent of an old-time hollywood romance set in the modern day world of restroom supplies entrepreneurs, phone sex scams, frequent flyer miles, periodical outbursts of rage, dominating siblings, and complex personalities. Only P.T. Anderson can combine all these idiosyncratic elements into an excellent well-constructed film. Adam Sandler plays our protagonist in a way you have never seen Sandler before. Sure, you do still see the `sandlerisms' you have seen before in his past films: raging outbursts, puppy face sadness, and the low-toned sarcasm. However, in `Punch-Drunk Love' sandlerisms are utilized to elicit major character traits which are imperative to the film's development; as opposed in past Sandler films, when these were used for cheesy comical moments. The most unique trait of our protagonist Barry Egan played by Sandler is that he purchases hundreds of `Healthy Choice' puddings & tv dinners in order to take advantage of their frequent flyer mileage promotion. There is no doubt in my mind that P.T. Anderson made the `healthy choice' in selecting Adam Sandler as his lead. I am not drunk when I say that Adam Sandler's performance is one of the best of the year and should garner him a Best Actor Oscar nomination. The rest of the cast of the film was also delightful to watch: Emily Watson as our leading lady, and Anderson regulars: Phillip Seymour Hoffman & Luis Guzman.  However, it was the restless energy of those double AA batteries  (Adam & Anderson) what made `Punch-Drunk Love' one of the best films of 2002. So punch in those numbers and purchase tickets for a knockout of a film called `Punch-Drunk Love'. ***** Excellent",Punch-Drunk Love
44,runamokprods,"Oddly Wonderful, Wonderfully Odd",9,17 September 2016,"A short, weird confection of a film, full of terrific moments, beautiful shots, excellent performances and odd ironies. Adam Sandler strips away all his comic overtones to play an angry, dysfunctional, fragile, obsessive compulsive - who we somehow still care for. Emily Watson just about makes us believe she could fall for this emotional wreck.While there are echoes of the Coen Bothers, this film is unlike any other I've ever seen. It's a weird and 90% successful mash-up of Hollywood romantic comedy, out-there art-film, exploration of despair, and surreal playfulness. The first time I saw it, it blew me away. The second time, prepared for its wild twists I could appreciate its subtle details more, but also noticed a few holes (e.g. Emily Watson's somewhat underdeveloped character - does she willfully not see Sandler's madness? Or if she does see it, what makes her love it?). One of those films I look forward to watching yet again.I'm thrilled that Criterion is finally giving this the special blu-ray treatment, although if you need to save money, Sony's old super-bit DVD does look quite good.",Punch-Drunk Love
45,MaxBorg89,"One of the weirdest, most interesting comedies in recent years",9,4 July 2007,"What can you do after something as groundbreaking as Magnolia? Simple: something smaller, whose aim is not to compete with the previous masterpiece, but simply remind people of your skills. David Fincher did a similar thing, following the mesmerizing Fight Club with the intriguing, if a bit conventional, Panic Room; Paul Thomas Anderson, on the other hand, has never done a real mainstream product, which is why his fourth film, Punch-Drunk Love, is a quirky, unpredictable, very charming comedy.At first sight, the film could be compared to Anderson's debut, Sydney, since both movies are very low-key and focus on a limited array of characters: the lead in this case is Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), an apparently normal guy who runs a business of his own from a warehouse unit. One day he meets a woman named Lena (Emily Watson) who asks him to look after her car for a while, and soon he notices there is a spark between them. It would all be fine, weren't it for two problems: firstly, Barry has anger control issues, which means he occasionally gets violent or starts crying for no real reason, due to the constant stress of being emotionally abused by his seven sisters; secondly, he has recently had a sexual encounter over the phone, and now the woman he talked to is asking for more money, and is willing to send her brothers to collect it, should he not satisfy her request.As always, Anderson is an amazing writer, and while the dialogue isn't as immediately quotable as it was in Boogie Nights or Magnolia, it is still a pleasure to hear exchanges that sound much better than the average rom-com lines. The film impresses on a technical level too, the gloomy cinematography and trademark tracking shots perfectly emphasizing the apparent solitude and emptiness in Barry's life.On the downside, there are a few moments when Anderson seems to rush a little bit between scenes, not giving them a chance to fully say what they need to, but that is a barely noticeable flaw in an otherwise superbly filmed and splendidly acted character study. Sandler in particular is surprising as the ambiguous protagonist: instead of the usual two-dimensional portrayals he gives in lesser comedies he understands Barry's problems and conflicting aspects and depicts them on screen with a subtlety that is unexpected from him. He is able to move from absolute rage in one scene (trashing a restaurant toilet) to touching tenderness in the next (any time he's with Watson) with utter conviction, never giving the impression that the two sides are part of two different movies. And this relates to the director's narrative techniques, which combine a quirky (in a good way) love story with an unconventional ""crime"" movie (allowing frequent Anderson collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman to impress with a hilarious swearing duel with Sandler) almost seamlessly, weaving them into a cohesive whole rather than estranging them from each other.Like all of Anderson's films, Punch-Drunk Love may not convince everyone: it is quite unusual and weird for a comedy, but it never reaches the surrealistic levels of Magnolia (perhaps because the director knows he can't top said film's frog-rain climax), remaining a down-to-earth, albeit bizarre (read: intriguing), art-house picture.",Punch-Drunk Love
46,iquine,Sandler Does Serious,6,2 November 2017,"(Flash Review)This is an unusual and uneven romantic tale about an unstable protagonist (Sandler) who lives a somber and solitary life until a woman enters the scene. For some unknown reason the female love interest is attracted to him and attempts to pierce his awkward outer shell while semi-surreal and dangerous incidents occur all around him, which also appears to increase her interest in him. The random incidents are interesting yet are difficult to fully tie back to the story or perhaps they are there to create a peculiar atmosphere. The other story lines are Sandler finds a sweepstakes loophole with a specific brand of pudding and after he buys an egregious amount of pudding packages, he tries to claim the prize immediately as well as him avoiding getting blackmailed a separate awkward incident. Will he be able to conquer his emotional baggage and his peculiar situations and open up for romance? Complimenting a quirky soundtrack, there was a running symbolic theme of telephones that is open to interpretation. It was an interesting and well- produced film with clunky pacing and perhaps a bit too vague for most people; great cinematography.",Punch-Drunk Love
47,noralee,Beautiful Looking Search for Love and Sense,7,7 December 2005,"""Punch Drunk Love ""is the first new French New Wave movie I've seen in years. It looks beautiful (thanks to cinematographer Robert Elswit -- though I'm not sure of the point of the interstitial abstractions), sounds good (thanks to the music of Jon Brion and some intriguing song selections), follows idiosyncratic characters in a tangled web that gradually starts to make some incidental sense, and leaves you feeling uncomfortably good about odd happenings.Adam Sandler is very much like ""Being There""s Chance the Gardener with a vicious temper and a family full of nosy sisters. Like Paul Thomas Anderson's previous film ""Magnolia,"" the ensemble has gradually revealed connections, here more emotionally coincidental than situationally. But where that film explored the cause and effects of feelings, this explores how scary behaviors that are misplaced in one context become frighteningly appropriate in another, particularly when searching for and getting love.

48,rooprect,Punch Drunk Love is a knockout!,9,26 January 2013,"I was never a big Adam Sandler fan, nor did I enjoy director Paul Thomas Anderson's prior hit ""Magnolia"" as much as critics raved. So I popped this movie in expecting no more than something to kill 90 mins or so.I was blown away from the opening scene:Picture a guy (Sandler) in a comically blue suit sitting in a creepy concrete room politely arguing on the phone about an airline promotion. The camera slowly surveys the absurdity and desolation of this man's seemingly pointless little life. Then things suddenly, violently and mysteriously take a turn. I knew from the first 5 minutes that this would be an exceptional film.What follows is something like ""Peewee's Big Adventure"" all grown up and directed by someone like Godard. And you gotta love that stupid blue suit which he never changes.With vast, absurd sets & bizarre deadpan humor reminiscent of the classic ""Joe vs the Volcano"" and vivid, oddball characters like in ""Amelie"", and with slow, voyeuristic camera work like in the Swedish ""Songs from the 2nd Floor"", this film achieves the perfect recipe for surreal comedy. You never know what to expect, and your bizarre expectations are never disappointed. I would compare this to other excellent offbeat films like Miranda July's ""The Future"", Emir Kusturica's ""Arizona Dream"" (an early Johnny Depp classic), anything directed by Jim Jarmusch (""Night on Earth"", ""Ghost Dog"", ""Coffee & Cigarettes"") and particularly, my favourite quirky romcom of all time, Vincent Gallo's ""Buffalo 66"".As with all the picks I just mentioned, ""Punch Drunk Love"" is a dreamlike story (not 'dreamy' but 'dreamLIKE') where events and images may seem random, but in the end it all comes together with a powerful & very satisfying message. The whole time, the film never loses its comedic edge, and although there aren't any big gags or witty punchlines, the strangeness of situations & characters had me laughing out loud in almost every scene.If you like unusual comedies, if you have an eye for art & an ear for poetry (not to mention the perfect musical score--pay close attention to the effect it has), don't hesitate to watch this movie. It made a Sandler as well as Anderson fan out of me.",Punch-Drunk Love

You can get in shoes of Adam Sandler in this one and understand his anger and conufusion. I love Adam Sandler in this role because he just showed he can act in serious roles and not just dumb comedy. Sequel to Punch Drunk Love : Adam Sandler goes to anger managment and Jack Nicholson cures his agressive behaviour.,Punch-Drunk Love
52,slokes,Sad Circus Music From PTA,6,26 December 2014,"Even the most pathetic person in the world can find love, as long as he is a character in a gentle romantic comedy with a decidedly art-house bent and a very creative director.Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a socially awkward, lonely man who runs a company selling novelty plungers (he calls them ""fungers"") and whose seven sisters hassle him quite cruelly for easy laughs. So when one of them, Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub) tries to introduce Barry to her friend, Lena (Emily Watson), he's understandably wary. ""I don't do stuff like that,"" he tells Elizabeth.""You don't really do anything,"" she replies.Lena proves to be more than he expected, and the experience of being with her challenges him to take on the world in a more focused way than he is used to.When I finished watching this the first time, I wondered who Paul Thomas Anderson thought he was kidding with this oddball flick. If he wanted to make a comedy, where were the laughs? If he wanted to make a serious rumination about love and life, why cast Adam Sandler and ask him to play Dustin Hoffman in ""Rainman?"" We get right away Barry's attraction to Lena, but what's in it for her? And why is the major crisis of the movie, Barry being extorted by a phone-sex line, so easily resolved?After a couple more viewings, I decided that it was less an attempt at presenting a serious romantic situation and more a rumination on how art and life intersect, or to be more exact, do not intersect. It's clear the more times you view ""Punch-Drunk Love"" the more you are to view it not as real but an over-the-top rom-com farce, with excessive movie-ish effects. There are more flares in this film than a J. J. Abrams space adventure. When Barry gets on a plane he is shot as if one of the astronauts in ""The Right Stuff.""As an examination of how movies work better than life, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is fascinating, if a bit hollow. I enjoyed very much Sandler's central performance, which works much better than I would have expected given I'm not a fan of him in more familiar comedy roles. He does a great job pulling us into Barry's troubled world and making us really like the guy.""You sound very nice and very personable,"" he tells a phone-sex operator at the outset of their call.Anderson's symbolism is bracingly overt here, perhaps part of the metacomedy he is working toward. In the beginning we watch a harmonium being dropped off mysteriously at Barry's place of work, as if to tell us our protagonist has a song to sing. When Barry and Lena leave a restaurant, we watch a moving van follow them from behind, telling us a big move is afoot.Anderson has become a major director since ""Punch-Drunk Love"" in a way he wasn't at the time; his films are bigger hits now, and more widely championed. I find ""Punch-Drunk Love"" to be his coming to terms with his burgeoning abilities, to play God and mock the ways certain types of films conspire to give audiences a happy ending. For all that seeming manipulation, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" has Anderson's charm, and sense of grace, as well as a brilliant in-the-moment performance by Sandler.I wish it was funnier, and made more sense, but I can't say I didn't enjoy the ride.",Punch-Drunk Love
53,ptb-8,the 'yellow submarine' of movies.,1,25 August 2006,"A music industry urban legend has it that The Beatles wrote their song Yellow Submarine as a joke: a childish nursery rhyme of stupefying repetition with a brass band pounding away, like 'London Bridge Is Falling Down"" set to Monty Python music; and they did this just to see if they could release any old trash, basic and ridiculous, to see if the public would lap it up, to see if the crits would make art of it, and to simply see what ridiculous nothingness they could foist on the world... like the emperor's new clothes. Well PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is the movie equivalent of that arrogant rude and insulting Beatles act. Gus Van Sant tried it with the boring 'drama' GERRY' and got caught again after his PSYCHO remake. But PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is as perfectly useless and silly and pointless and as massive a hoax as is Yellow Submarine. You know how the Anglo west roars with astonishment at the French clasping Jerry Lewis cinematic durges like THE PATSY?

54,rbverhoef,Sandler is terrific,6,24 April 2004,"One of the reasons I would recommend 'Punch-Drunk Love' is Adam Sandler. For the first time he is the best thing in a movie and I must admit he does a tremendous job with his character, named Barry Egan. He has the same aggressive outbursts he has in his comedies but here they fit his character and the story. He seems like a pretty normal guy although you see something in his face, something ready to come out, and when it comes you can almost understand it.The story is a love story, in a way. The love interest is Lena (Emily Watson). They are both different and therefore there is a chance it could work. Another part of the story involves a sex line that Barry called. They have his credit card number and everything and force him from time to time to donate money. How this story goes from there is not for me to reveal but it gives us some very unexpected moments.That is one of the other good things in this movie. Most of the time you don't know and can't even guess what will happen next. It is another reason to see this movie, although I do think it has some boring moments as well. The story develops slow and that makes it a movie not all people will like. If you like Adam Sandler-movies like 'Mr. Deeds' or 'Big Daddy' I think you should skip 'Punch-Drunk Love'. If you like other movies from director Paul Thomas Anderson I am not sure. I liked 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' a lot better, but you might want to give it a chance.",Punch-Drunk Love
55,truemythmedia,Sandler's Best,10,6 August 2019,"Punch Drunk Love is probably Paul Thomas Anderson's most user friendly film. It's accessible for most film viewers looking for a quirky, dark, romantic comedy, but it also tells a story that hasn't been told before. It's a film with great technical aspects- everything from tracking shots to the framing this movie is meant to feel chaotic as to relate to Barry even more, the music molds with the crazy to make a nice fit. At times the music works to create an almost uneasy feeling, and that helps the viewer to feel what Barry is feeling. The character change as the story progresses is just a delight to watch, especially at the end when Barry faces his troubles head on. The film gives a message of hope and love to all broken people in the world: when life is swinging at you, swing harder. Adam Sandler simply gives his all and his best as Barry Egan, fully realizing his talents as an actor under the guidance of PTA is great to watch as he completely transforms into the role. I have nothing but great things to say about this gem from the great Paul Thomas Anderson. It may not be his most complex or daring works, but it's authentic in its style, its message and its characters and should not be missed.",Punch-Drunk Love
56,Movie-ManDan,Adam Sandler's First Great Film.,10,3 March 2020,"In the wake of Sandler's explosion in the recent 'Uncut Gems,' I feel the need to share the first great thing Adam Sandler ever did. Sure he did some funny movies before this such as 'Big Daddy' and 'Happy Gilmore,' but 'Punch-Drunk Love' was the first to show that he can stand toe-to-toe with some of the best actors in the business.Director Paul Thomas Anderson exploded into Hollywood with a wild string of impressive hits such as 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia.' He decided to make a more calm film than his previous trio. He was also a fan of Sandler's and saw some potential in him. The rest is history.Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan. He has his own business and is the only boy out of seven overbearing sisters. He tries to put on a happy facade, but he suffers from depression. It is never really clear as to why he is depressed, but that's often it-people can get depression just because. He calls a sex hotline and gets scammed, leading the head (Hoffman) to go after him. He also meets Lena (Watson) through one of his sisters and they really hit it off. His relationship with Lena makes him a stronger individual and gives him the will to repel his newfound enemies.As a psychological drama, the choice in actor is crucial. Sandler's portrayal of a saddened man could easily have failed or, at least, not have come off as strong. But Anderson must have had a sixth sense when he got a man who was best known for playing extremely immature man-children to play such a serious character.Aside from the great character study we are presented with, this is also an amazing work of art. The lighting and of colours are used in presice ways. Throughout most of the beginning, a shadow is cast over Barry's face. This darkness on him reflects the darkness within him. When he spends time with Lena, the shadows diminish. He also wears a blue suit throughout the film. Blue always indicates sadness, but it takes a new meaning later on since Lena is always seen wearing red. I love movies where this much attention has deep meaning.Is there a flaw? Yes, it ends too soon. I was absolutely loving everything this film had. Adding an extra twenty minutes would have made the experience even stronger without overstaying it's welcome. But the way it stands, it is still and artistic character study that will remain a staple in the careers of Adam Sandler and Paul Thomas Anderson.The movie is too good to give it less than a full score.

57,rosscinema,Adam Sandler shines,7,4 November 2002,"I did enjoy Paul Thomas Anderson's film Punch-Drunk Love but I didn't love it. Its hard to love Anderson's films because he seems to purposely leave gaping holes in his plots. He leaves a lot to discuss after viewing and I do appreciate that. The first thing that came to me was that I had viewed an updated Charlie Chaplin film. Not that I'm comparing Adam Sandler to Chaplin but the whole plot. The old fashioned music, Sandler being a misfit, the misfit falling in love, the misfit convincing the girl he's truthful...and a few other things. Emily Watson has a very expressionistic face especially with her eyes and I can envision her as a silent film actress with those wide eyes. Adam Sandler is very good here and you can see he has talent. It's refreshing to see him in material other than his own written stories. Like I said, I didn't love it because of the holes. Like what was the significance of the harmonium? And why would an intelligent and attractive woman like Watson want to date Sandler? The editing is good and so is the use of sound. Sandler gives his character Barry real depth and while he is prone to private outbursts you really feel for the guy. I guess its a tribute to Sandler's performance!

Its not funny (having an in-universe character say ""this is funny"" all the time doesn't count). There isn't enough logic or structure for there to really be drama, and the romance isn't interesting because the writer forgot to write characters. This movie is so bizarre. Its just a collection of scenes trying to be random enough that it will be entertaining, but it doesn't work. Some elements in this movie could've worked if the characters were more interesting and if there was some kind of a basic plot for everything to be centered around to give it a sense of structure. Even then for this to work as a pure surreal comedy where nothing makes sense, they don't really go to far enough extremes for it to work.One of the reasons why this movie is so boring is because the cinematography and the editing is terrible. Its so flat and lifeless. There is no style (unless just making everything overexposed and hard to follow is a style). Nothing about this movie works. Overall its really boring and makes no sense and is a complete waste of time. Its not even worth talking about honestly. After watching this movie I felt a bit upset.

59,RainDogJr,"The Work of P.T. Anderson: ""Punch-Drunk Love"" (2002)",10,28 February 2008,"After watching P.T. Anderson's new film i decide to check some of his previous works that i missed when they were released and this film was one of those. ""Punch-Drunk"" is a unique film about love with a really great character played in a great way by Adam Sandler.The film is about Barry Egan (Adam Sandler),a lonely man who owns a little company. He is having a really hard time in his life due to some problems with his own personality and to his problematic seven sisters,but when he meet Lena (Emily Watson) he will find a reason to be strong and deal with his problems.The plot of this film is really good and is a fresh story about a person who found a new way to see life because of love. Barry is that person. First he was a really strange man, who spend all of his time in his work and never have any kind of relation with other people, except to his work partners and to his seven sisters. He was having a really weird time and the film itself is really weird in the beginning. There is a great scene, when one of Barry's sisters and Lena invites Barry for lunch, where you can feel how messy was the life of Barry because the scene have a lot of noise from everywhere because everybody is trying to talk to Barry while he is having his own problems with a sex line and his partners are having his own problems too with some merchandise. And it's curious that all ends when Lena returns and ask Barry to go for dinner. Another part of the story, the problem with the sex line, ends too because of Lena, who was the reason for Barry to travel from L.A. to Utah just to make sure that Lena will never be in danger again.About the cast: i must say that i really like the work of Sandler with all of the entertaining comedies but this is his best performance. Emily Watson is great and very beautiful. The support cast is good too with Luis Guzman but for me is Philip Seymour Hoffman who makes the best support role in very few minutes playing a great character. The music and the camera work are really brilliant in every scene and the song ""He Needs Me"" is just perfect for that memorable scene in Hawaii.Conclusion: i love this film, a very original story that definitely isn't for all the audiences, specially for those who might think that this is a common Sandler film. For me is a gem that could be more appreciate in the future. 10 out of 10Region 4 DVD: this film is not very popular in Mexico as others films with Sandler so i found this DVD in a very good price for be a double-disc edition. The extra disc contains great material like deleted scenes, the art of Jeremy Blake, some trailers and a 12 minutes short directed by Anderson. Excellent presentation.",Punch-Drunk Love
60,Matt_Layden,Sandler Can Act?,7,20 July 2009,"The thing that P.T.A films tend to have in common is that they are all overly long. I always mention how he could trim a few minutes here and there and still attain the same picture. Magnolia cracks in at 3 hours for crying out loud. Then comes Punch Drunk Love, the so called loner of his film resume. Okay, so I came up with that one myself, but I think it fits. This film has the same feel as any other P.T.A film, yet it still feels different. Hence a part of the family, but the loner of the group. It's funny how this one film of his is his shortest and yet I wanted it to be longer. That is irony.Punch Drunk Love doesn't have any real plot, it's just about this weird guy who desires attention, among other weird things he wants/does. Smashing a family members glass windows? Okay, whatever helps you buddy. He gets messed up in some phone sex scam and falls in love with his sisters friend around the same time. These new things challenge him to step out of his comfort zone and do something that takes courage. There is no going from point A to B here, in my opinion, just things that happen to this guy and how he happens to react to them.The lead character is played by Adam Sandler, in his first of a few semi serious roles. There is still a bit of comedy in his performance, and in the role itself. Running into a glass window is a gag you'll usually find in low-brow comedies (The Whole 9 Yards, even though I like that film) so seeing stuff like that seems out of place here. The subtle use of colour to draw attention to things was very well done. They even point this out numerous times in the film. (Why are you wearing that suit?) This is my least favourite Anderson film, yet it's still a good film overall. It just doesn't seem as important as the others. It stands on it's own and I appreciate that, I just wanted a bit more from this one.",Punch-Drunk Love

I real can't think of any substantial complaints to make. The first few minutes were a bit disorienting, because it was just so different. I love getting a completely unexpected experience from a movie, and Punch-Drunk Love was as fresh as they come. The next time someone asks me what my favorite kind of movie is, I'll tell them that I love movies just like this one. Movies that are brazen mishmashes of genres and styles, adding up too much more than the sum of their parts. Paul Thomas Anderson must be a brilliant man. The story and direction was immense, and whoever put together this score must have been inspired by the Muses. The cast was marvelous. I'll never be able to look at Adam Sandler the same way, again. Emily Mortimer's character may be one of the most appealing fictional personages that has ever been imagined. I'm really not trying to gush like this, but I can't help it. Punch-Drunk Love is easily one of my twenty-five favorite movies, ever. No, it's not for everyone, but you owe it to yourself to try to watch it at least once.",Punch-Drunk Love

63,fntstcplnt,Punch-Drunk Love (2002),8,6 March 2020,"Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. Starring Adam Sandler, Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzmán, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Karen Kilgariff, Robert Smigel. (R)Anxious antisocial misfit Barry Egan (Sandler), constantly ridiculed by his domineering sisters, encounters a woman (Watson) who is strangely charmed by him; he has also stumbled upon a way to win over a million frequent flier miles by purchasing large quantities of pudding (a sub-plot that's based on a true story) and is the victim of an extortion scheme after calling a shady phone sex line. Director Anderson takes a break from his multi-character mosaics for an almost hypnotically odd film, with suppressed rage percolating at frequent intervals, yet a surprisingly touching and outrageously funny one as well, making tremendous use out of the immature and volatile persona that Sandler is known for playing. Sandler taps into a well of loneliness and stifled exasperation to create a marvelously unique and fascinating character; like the film itself, truly unpredictable. Winsome Watson's sweetness and strangeness is more subtle but no less effective, and in a small role, Hoffman is a degenerate volcano that wasn't expecting to meet his match in Barry. Won't be for all tastes--the star's faithful flock largely greeted it with disinterest, if not hostility, and Jon Brion's brilliantly discordant score will turn off some--but anyone who can latch on to the film's erratic rhythms and gorgeous visuals will be richly rewarded.85/100",Punch-Drunk Love

You probably haven't seen such a story, such camera work, such ""symbolism"", such acting by Adam Sandler and the great thing is, you haven't seen it done in such a way by director Anderson before! It's not a feel-good-comedy. You feel nervous all the time, you feel compassion and you feel sorrow.

65,Screen_Blitz,Stylish and unconventional romantic tale powered by a thoughtful direction and performances,7,30 November 2016,"Adam Sandler usually finds the spotlight in his hysterical man-child typecasting in the comedic genre. When talking about more dramatic projects, his name is usually the not the first one that comes to mind especially for a film directed by Paul Thomas Anderson the bright mind behind 'Hard Eight', 'Boogie Nights', and the ensemble cast feature 'Magnolia'. However, Anderson gets an opportunity to step outside his usual cinematic fare and try something new in this darkly funny romantic tale starring Adam Sandler in a highly distinct role from his typical buffoonish comedic formula. Pinning a plethora of emotional twists and pinches of dark humor uprooted by a dramatic portrayal of lonely man run by the often funny Adam Sandler, this unconventional romantic drama sees Anderson's taking one the romantic genre in one of the most unique forms yet. Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a lonely Californian who lives a mundane life of selling toilet plungers with his partner Lance (played by Luis Guzman) while facing constant verbal abuse from his seven sisters. Out of loneliness, Barry contacts a sex hotline in attempt to find love, only to himself a target for extortion of money when the operator contacts her supervisor. He soon falls in love with Lena Leonard (played by Emily Watson), a co-worker of one of his sisters; but finds their relationship when in danger when he threatened by Dean Trumbell (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the man behind the extortion ring.Paul Thomas Anderson proves a filmmaker to count on to come up a love story devoid of the tiresome romance formula. What Anderson serves to the table is a story of a lonely man searching for love, but with some unexpected results that defies against the usual emotional manipulative route. This isn't to say however that the story doesn't leave any room for some raw emotion, but instead balances its romantic core with touch of gallows humor and heart to allow us to grow attachment to the characters. The story knows how to be smart and knows when the appropriate areas to slap a fair dosage of humor to the table, even when it flounders more than one occasion. But the biggest surprise this movie offers other than Paul Thomas Anderson's direction and sweet script is Adam Sandler in arguably his most captivating performance in his career. Rather than playing the usual immature goober many comedic fans are accustomed to, Sandler takes on a slightly more serious role that allows him to expand upon his emotional range. To much delight, he achieves this role quite proficiently and brings a sense of freshness to his chemistry with Emily Watson. Though their romantic chemistry doesn't quite strike the chord, its nonetheless sweet and empowered with sentimental contrivances. Frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson is Phillip Seymour Hoffman who gives a sharp portrayal of the antagonistic extortionist, but his limited amount of screen time sadly leave him in a less than memorable role.Punch-Drunk Love is a provocative, if flawed romantic tale greatly powered by a thoughtful direction by the ingenious Paul Thomas Anderson and a smart delivery of performances by Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. Though it doesn't necessarily rise towards the level of Paul Thomas Anderson's other efforts, it makes for a fresh romantic treat that really works.",Punch-Drunk Love
66,oneguyrambling,I don't get it. I don't like it.,6,14 November 2010,"I must have seen this movie referenced a million times in the last few years for various reasons: - Look Sandler can act! - At last a love story that guys can watch. - The most underrated films of the But it was the Top 100 movies of the 2000s so far list I read last week that tipped the scales and sent me to the shops.Now I have a pretty simple formula (I think) for rating movies, same as most people. Charm, action, laughs, acting, plot etc are all in there and help me come to my conclusion, but the most important factor is did I actually like the damn thing? And in this case I didn't.I don't care how clever a film thinks it is, how interwoven the characters are by the end of the film or the unlikely circumstances that bring them together in a supposedly ""romantic"" piece like this, if I don't like it I don't like it.Now that I've said I don't like it I'm not going to leave it there, here is why: The primary character of Punch-Drunk Love, played by Sandler, is thoroughly unlikeable, offputting even, his name is Barry Egan. In real terms I would never choose to associate with this guy.The reasons behind his psychological issues are never explained, but we do see at one point that he has 7 sisters who emotionally bully him and seem to have always done so. Barry seems very fragile, he is socially pathetic, prone to fits of violence, lies to others to their faces to protect himself and withdrawn.Into his life comes a seemingly innocent and nice young woman named Lena played by Emily Watson. Why she takes a shine to Barry is also never explained and he immediately and constantly lies to her and makes rash decisions that sometimes turn out to be to her detriment. Oh and he also follows her to another timezone without notice. You might call it romantic, but when Barry is screaming and swearing at his sister from a Hawaiian payphone demanding she reveal where Lena is staying if I were Lena I probably wouldn't want to be located.So once they get together I am supposed to be happy they found love? Yay, a violent social misfit with the tendency to solve everything with violence has scored with a fresh faced and friendly young woman.F that.If Barry managed to hook up with one of my female friends or relatives I would be horrified, regardless of how quirky he seemed or her plans to ""change him"".If there was ever a sequel and they decided to commence PDL 2 immediately after the credits rolled in this, I can't help but feel that either a hospital or funeral scene would be happening for Lena within the first 10 minutes, after all there is no evidence that Barry changes one iota in this film, if anything his behaviour gets worse as the film goes along.Other stuff happens in Punch-Drunk Love, and there are some pretty effective scenes at times so I can't honestly give it a horrible score, but when the central premise is so disgusting to me I don't care how good critics might say it is A note that will never be read: To the director of Punch-Drunk Love, Wes Anderson, and for that matter the makers of Napoleon Dynamite and similar films.Filling your film with unreal characters and then putting them in unreal situations and making them say unreal things and perform unreal acts isn't clever anymore.It was never clever.It was initially different and even a little amusing because it was fresh. Now it is just lazy. Based upon the diminishing returns of Nacho Libre, The Life Aquatic and Punch-Drunk Love, the public has quickly grown tired of your gimmicks.Please try something different.And you're damn right I just listed Punch-Drunk Love alongside Nacho Libre! Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. 95 minutes of well-made tediousness and a reprehensibly warped lead character. Punch-Drunk Love is shockingly over-rated.Another thought: It is now two days since I watched Punch-Drunk Love and I was amazed at how p*ssed off I was with it once I started thinking about it later. Even now I am a little too wound up to be writing this in an unbiased manner, and I'm the guy that thinks Bad Santa and The Ref are funny stuff.I was trying to think of the last film that enraged me for no tangible reason and it was just now, after I finished writing this that I realized it was Funny People last year.Funny People of course starred Adam Sandler! I don't especially hate Sandler and have no irrational (that I know of) reason to find disgust in his films (aside from Billy Madison for sucking arse), so perhaps this is a coincidence. I do find it a little weird that the two films that caused me to over-react in such a strongly negative manner feature the same guy, and for similar reasons: A guy we are supposed to feel sorry for being a horribly flawed person with precious few redeeming qualities.No idea what this means, I just found it odd. But I still can't for the life of me understand why anyone can watch this and find entertainment value in it, let alone consider it one of the masterpieces of the last decade.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",Punch-Drunk Love
67,Sirus_the_Virus,The best work Sandler or even perhaps P.T.A. has done.,10,7 January 2010,"For many years, Adam Sandler was known for his immature humor that he frequently uses. He still kind of is. and it's a shame too. Though i'll admit that I like most of his films, Sandler has a hidden talent. Kind of like when Robin Williams does it. Though I like his films too. Jim Carrey too. Though I love all of his movies. All of these actors have a hidden talent. They can all do drama. And damn it they can do it well. Sandler here reminds me a little of myself. Though not really. His character here is so interesting. Paul Thomas Anderson, to me, seem like he rarely ever does a movie. It's a shame too. Cause the guy is a genius. In 2007's There will be blood, he showed us a true madness story. And blew our minds. With 2002's under-appreciated Punch drunk love, he shows us many different genres. Punch drunk love has a lot. It is funny at times, occasionally, well, I hate to say it but scary. It gets kind of insane towards the end. It also to some extent romantic. Also to some extent sad in some way. Oh another thing that I didn't mention is that it is fantastic.Punch drunk love is about a man named Barry Egan(played by Adam Sandler, in perhaps his best performance yet), a socially impaired salesman with rage issues. All his life, he has been intimidated by his seven bitch sisters. He is also very lonely. He is so lonely that he ends up talking to a somewhat hooker over the phone. That decision that doesn't really work out too well.His life kind of changes when he meets Lina(played by the always likable Emily Watson), a date being set up by his sister. Who throughout the entire film is telling her that she wouldn't of liked him. Though she does.What's sad about the film is that Barry is a nice guy. And he has a terrible life. Constantly being criticized by his sisters. and what I loved about the film is that so much is going on. Also, it shows that even the people with problems can even have a happy life. And by the end, Barry does. Paul Thomas Anderson brings us what could be his best movie yet. Please, if you haven't already, see it.Punch drunk love: A+",Punch-Drunk Love
68,bobsgrock,Crazy little thing called love.,8,26 July 2010,"Paul Thomas Anderson will be remembered years from now as the atypical Hollywood director in an era when box-office receipts are considered the utmost of greatness. With films like Boogie Nights and Magnolia, he established himself as a new type of Altman, able to work seamlessly with large ensemble casts and connect various plot lines together in one crazy fashion.After the success of Magnolia, Anderson, like most great directors, decided to go into a completely different style of work. On a smaller budget, with only about five major characters and an intimate story, Anderson went with what he was feeling. Here, the feeling is love; but what is love when you're Barry Egan? And what does love mean to someone like Lena Leonard? Adam Sandler and Emily Watson have remarkable chemistry here; somehow we are able to look past the craziness and absurdity of the context of the situation and focus on what is most important. This is due most in part to Sandler and Watson as well as Anderson's direction, which paces just right and focuses only on what is necessary to the story; there are no subplots here.This is the type of film, like most of Anderson's other work, that people will divide over immediately. Some will find it pretentious and self-appreciative. Fortunately, I have never felt that in any of his work. Some see this as an ""Adam Sandler art-house film"" but I see more. I see the story of a man, tortured by many of the people in his life, especially his seven sisters, who goes on a journey to begin again. Too often, romantic films are so predictable that all of the feeling and emotion has been drained before it begins. Not with Punch-Drunk Love. These are not conventional characters, so this is not a conventional film.",Punch-Drunk Love
69,blott2319-1,"Odd, but also oddly satisfying",7,10 April 2020,"All I could think after I finished Punch-Drunk Love was ""What did I just watch?"" It is one of the weirdest romantic comedies I've ever seen. I mean, I think it's a romantic comedy. It was mildly humorous and mildly romantic, after all. Between a random harmonium that seems to serve no purpose, piles of pudding, and extreme outbursts of anger there's so much oddity filling the life of Barry Egan. Yet his insecure and heavily introverted way of living is completely relatable. I hate to watch him suffer, and can't stand to see how his gaggle of sisters treat him. Adam Sandler delivers a solid performance as this strange character who struggles so much to form real connections with people, and he never falls into an over-the-top persona like a Happy Madison film. I liked Emily Watson as his love interest, although I sometimes struggled to see the quirkiness from her character that would be necessary to form a strong bond with someone as troubled as Barry Egan.There's something engaging in Punch-Drunk Love that I have trouble explaining. It never went down the expected path (which I appreciate,) but it also didn't have the flow of a normal structured plot (which I dislike.) There is a mildly surreal feeling to this film, almost as if it is a story that implements magical realism. Yet it is grounded more than I expected after the opening scene. People act odd, but they still exist in a somewhat normal reality. There's a significant lack of backstory for any of these characters, which was strange. You could deduce some things about them and their relationships based on what we see in the film, but there were still aspects of history that I wanted to clearly understand. I didn't even know what Barry did for a living. In summary, there were aspects of Punch-Drunk Love that I struggled with because the story is so unusual, but I found it oddly engaging and would like to watch it again.",Punch-Drunk Love
70,Karl Self,When Barry Met Lena,5,31 August 2008,"This is a very romantic love story with intentionally odd, opaque and sometimes tedious bits stapled on to raise its intellectual value. The love story is very good though. Not very realistic, but I still dream of having a bossy sister who will introduce me to a gushing Emily Watson some day.Paul Thomas Anderson is obviously a great film maker, but he has the unfortunate tendency to wander off into la-la-land rather than to stick with good storytelling. Protagonist Barry's sisters, for example, are really underdeveloped, they're meant to be dominating but I thought they were generally really nice and doting (the fact that they called him ""gayboy"" twenty years ago doesn't cut it with me). Barry channels his emotions into occasional violent outbursts which I thought were simply unrealistic, as were people's reactions to them (few restaurant managers would merely ask you to leave after discovering that you have smashed up their bathroom).What I really hate this movie for are all the artsy, pseudo-intellectual red herrings in it. Much fuss is made about a blue suit Barry is wearing (his sisters repeatedly harry him for wearing this blue suit), or about a broken harmonium which Barry picks up from the street, and which symbolises love or something. I can only guess that this is meant to lend the movie a mysterious atmosphere, and to fill gaps in the threadbare plot -- or that Anderson put all that crap it in to sate his personal vanity, because he could.This movie is OK to watch, it's very well filmed and keeps up a moment of suspense, but unlike Anderson's other movies, I don't expect it to resonate with me for very long.",Punch-Drunk Love
71,sharky_55,I'm a dentist.,5,25 February 2016,"There is a scene in Punch Drunk Love of such perfectly whipped up chaos. A first meeting with a potential blind date has gone amiss, and both parties are presumably disappointed. And then Lena, played by Emily Watson with such wide, trusting eyes, hesitates at her car, much like Sandler does the same at the door to the party, and resolves to make that long walk back and ask him out. But that is not all that is going on; the phone sex line is bugging him again for money, and slapstick type accidents are happening in the work environment in the background. Anderson visualises Barry's anxiety on screen - it would have been easy to let the acting portray it, as when he smashes up the bathroom. But here it burrows into our minds too. The upbeat, percussive soundtrack grows louder and louder until it almost drowns out the dialogue. The prying, inquisitive Elizabeth's speech gets quicker, more nagging. The characters walk faster. The edits sharply cut away from the accidents, as if Barry was forceful pushing them to the back of his mind. It is not an easy thing for him to do.There is a strong suggestion that Lena is the same type of anxious loner that Barry is. There is a subtle red blur in the supermarket background as if she was creeping on him obsessively. Her apartment is as bare and featureless as a warehouse - in the same way that Barry makes his opening phone call, shoved into the corner of an empty room. She brushes off little signs like the bleeding hand and the romantic surprise in Hawaii only after one date. Is she better at hiding it than Barry? It is easier to pinpoint Sandler's nervous and depressive energy because this is his film, but there could very well be one for Lena. I think it suffers for it because it doesn't feel much like a victory in the end at all, but two messed up people getting together. The amount of co-operative indulgence would be never-ending. She enters his life like a breath of fresh air, initially. The cool blue tints broadcast this, and so does her bright red dress. Get it, because he is feeling blue? The sunset skies are overexposed until they are basically white, like the outside becoming a living nightmare for Barry. The camera basically physically follows her walk away after their first conversation, mimicking his incessant gaze. It seems likely that this is the first women that has addressed him directly in a long while that isn't a sibling. Later she wears purple, as if to symbolise a coming together. There are two main musical motifs, and Anderson uses them with careless abandon. The romantic orchestration theme is liberally thrown over every scene between the lovestruck couple, like every ending to any rom-com ever. It feels like there is an intent to subvert, but nothing materialises. They walk quickly towards each other, the camera dollying just as frantically, and kiss in the silhouetted money shot from the poster. He is energised by this love, as he so passionately declares. But it feels shallow and unearned; corny in the way love has empowered him to briefly change his life, and with a darker, more pathetic undertone suggested by Watson's similar character. And the way the circular wipe focuses on them holding hands? Ugh. Sandler attempts to breach new ground. It has been observed that this is a subversion of his usual character, the petulant, violent man-child. His sister's constant bullying and derision have led him to develop a self-defense mechanism; which is is to say, smashing things and shouting. Their demeaning is relentless, but loses power because it becomes so uniform and constant; all but one of the seven sisters make brief appearances, and their abuse begins to morph into one. His shouting match with Philip Seymour Hoffman is supposed to be a strong, pivotal moment for his self-esteem and confidence, but it veers into comedic territory as they sputter out insults for which they have no ammo, and descend into childish screaming. Sandler has a few little redeeming moments that become the saving grace for his character. His bodily mannerisms become like a cowering dog accustomed to years of abuse; hearing the plea for money on the phone, he slowly backs away and shuffles towards the wall, as if fending off an invisible attack. When he first takes (he feels it is like stealing) the harmonium, he peeks around to see if anyone will claim it, and then scurries away with the whole thing. And is that him playing the off-key, amateurish piece during the credits?My biggest problem with this movie is that it veers wildly whenever Barry has a violent or emotional fit, and then quickly hides it away with another romantic moment smothered by the score. It barely addresses the root cause, his abusive siblings, and suggests that with love anything can be overcome. I was momentarily fist-pumping as he attacked those blackmailing con-men, and then disturbed by the complete lack of empathy and awareness of what he had just done, its sudden brutality, and the way that Lena seems to just brush it off and never mention it again. Of course what they did was wrong, but there's a coldness to his revenge, and a mean streak to how he shouts obscenities over the phone to his blackmailer and sister. All of this points to something that is not healthy long-term for Barry, but does the film ever address this? No, it's too busy framing those romantic silhouettes, and those longing confessions of love and re- commitment. Sandler isn't soaked from hair to toe with tears in his eyes and yearning in his voice Notebook-style during that confrontation outside Lena's door, but he might as well be.",Punch-Drunk Love
72,aciessi,P.T. Anderson Touched to the Core of Me,10,9 March 2014,"Punch-Drunk Love is an effectively emotional film that brings an urgency to the meaning of romance in our lives. This is not your typical Adam Sandler movie. Oh no, this is a masterpiece. Here, he abandons his grating buffoon charade that bludgeons his career and instead plays a profound and tortured man who suffers all the hallmarks of Aspergers. He spends his days hiding from the world in a lonely garage, and dealing with the constant bullying of his psychotic sisters. When one of them hooks him up with a shy British woman, he falls madly in love, but only after he convinces her just how much of a beautiful man he really is. This story is so touching, it brings a tear to my eye. Theirs is a love so unique, so taboo, so justifiably beautiful. P.T. Anderson really pins down controversial subjects, but even a narrative as simple as a love story can he really bring his all to. It's a truly magnificent picture.",Punch-Drunk Love

Punch-Drunk Love is a perfect example of a fine work. This is in my opinion Adam Sandler's finest performance. Sandler is recently involved in atrocious and unfunny garbage, and its a wonder why he doesn't try more serious roles. His best performances are there in more dramatic roles. Emily Watson was also stellar in her role. Its a film that keeps you in captivation, and you are drawn into Sandler's misunderstood yet very compelling character.

74,adamscastlevania2,A very rare beast indeed,7,3 June 2015,"(67%) Watching this very odd film is a real eye opener. Adam Sandler does something he very rarely ever does: he actually tries without being trying. Here he's funny, interesting, there's no laziness or stupid voices, and above all else he delivers an honesty very good performance. So the big question really is why Grown ups 2? This may be a masterpiece compared to most of his back catalogue, but this still has a couple of issues surrounding its frantic nature at times being a bit too grating to watch. There isn't a whole lot of depth to the plot, but there's lots of little nice touches throughout meaning this is something I'd happily watch again and see something new that I'd missed. This is certainly well worth a look simply just to see another, very fine side of the largely wasted talent of Adam Sandler.",Punch-Drunk Love

Adam Sandler picks up where he left off in The Wedding Singer (and then some - creating an supremely original 3-dimensional character), Emily Watson breathes believability into a part that could have been ridiculous by actually making us feel that she has a genuine empathy for Adam's borderline psychotic Barry, and the story unfolds in a totally unpredictable way, which always gets major points with me.  However (and I wish I didn't have a 'however' with this movie), by the end it wasn't very satisfying and I left the theatre feeling that perhaps some of the best scenes wound up on the cutting-room floor - the film just didn't feel 'complete' to me. Still, it was worth watching and I would recommend it for its sheer originality alone.",Punch-Drunk Love
76,FilmOtaku,A slight departure from P.T. Anderson's `usual',8,20 April 2004,"Being a big fan of P.T. Anderson's work since I saw `Boogie Nights' (about 3 times in one week at the theater) years ago, I anxiously awaited the release of his latest film.  Then I heard it starred Adam Sandler, who is one of my least favorite actors of all time, but even then I figured that if anyone is going to make me not want to start throwing things at Sandler's image, it would be Anderson.  After all, he got me to respect Tom Cruise after seeing `Magnolia'.  When I finally got to see the film this past weekend (after wanting to see the film for about a year) I wasn't disappointed, and I found that my trust was not misplaced.  Anderson took Sandler and turned him into a sad sack who is so psychologically screwed up he would be an analyst's dream.  Emily Watson is his perfect counterpart as a classy yet extremely quirky love interest.  The content is pure P.T. Anderson.  There are issues that are brought up that are completely bizarre and unexplained, and there are themes that are culled from real-life stories or incidents.  Stylistically, it's a slight departure in that it isn't quite as flashy or `slick' as his last two films, but the bright primary colors that pervade the cinematography are absolutely beautiful.  And instead of the steady 70's and 80's soundtrack that he usually utilizes, he kept it more simple this time, and just as inspired with the continuous running of `He Needs Me' from the `Popeye' soundtrack. That touch was not only fitting, but also simply brilliant. 
I love the work of P.T. Anderson, and was absolutely charmed and endeared to this film.  Just like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' isn't going to make me watch a Jim Carrey comedy, I'm still going to avoid Adam Sandler comedies like the plague, but I have to say that I respect him for his work in this film.  This is the kind of romance film I like, and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't settle for the kind of romantic comedy/dramas that are churned out now by Hollywood.--Shelly",Punch-Drunk Love

79,Ben_Cheshire,"The most original, surprising movie in recent times.",10,21 November 2003,"I finally saw Punch-Drunk Love, and it was everything i was expecting and more. I been waiting half a year now - b.c i missed the theatre release, and have finally seen it on DVD. I wanted to see it since i heard a radio review of it calling it a romantic comedy on the edge and a movie like none you've ever seen before, and of course, that P.T Anderson had made his first movie after magnolia, and that he'd given himself the project of making Adam Sandler into a respectable actor - and if not for Anger Management coming out at the same time, and the mass populace going to see that instead of this due to the macro millions those producers shelled out on advertising, this would have totally done it for him. I'm just bitter that in central hollywood more money is spent advertising a picture than making the picture itself - so how can artists like P.T Anderson compete? Ppl judge the quality of a movie by how much they've heard about it (how many ads on tele they see for it - but who has the money for that?). In any case, Sandler gives a striking performance in this movie, and should be given the opportunity to do more good work. Only problem is he seems to have been born for this role, and i'm not sure how many other parts will suit his particular sensibilities (his angry/quiet persona which is here put to great use by master auteur P.T Anderson - who is a man to look out for). Sandler gives a performance rich in subtlety and heart, which is what separates this from his own comic movies. That, and his juvenile sense of humour.Punch-Drunk Love is the most magical film i've seen since Mulholland Drive. For someone who's seen an awful lot of movies it opens your eyes as if for the first time to the magic of movies.Watching Magnolia, in fact, felt a bit like this - but for me Punch-Drunk is a much more enjoyable experience. And for the first time a romance story has not seemed hackneyed or cliched. Not since Annie Hall has the romance genre been truly seen afresh, as if the director were writing the first and ultimate example of the genre.Not to say that P-D Love is just a romance - don't expect that. Like Magnolia, this P.T Anderson feature can not be pigeonholed in any genre. Don't think of it as a comedy or a romance - if you like, watch it as a ""drama"" and then you'll be relaxed enough to laugh when its funny; be upset when its tense, virtually weep with joy when its ecstatic.There is a beautiful montage on the DVD called ""Blood and Blossoms"" which is a perfect alternative title to Punch-Drunk Love. If one-line summaries are your thing (then P-D Love probably will not be! But if you're still curious) then P-D Love can be said to be about what romance and violence (blood and blossoms; Punch-Drunk Love) have in common. They're both unpredictable, edgy, often uncontrollable, coming in fits and bursts, and at any moment could break out or cease.In short, Clifford's Comments are: the most exciting movie of the last year, indeed of recent times. Compared to Tarantino's comeback of Kill Bill (which i actually have nothing against), this is a rewarding masterpiece which actually furthers P.T Andersons' already rich contribution to modern cinema. If i were any more superlative i'd be on commission.",Punch-Drunk Love
80,ofpsmith,"A quirky, Adam Sandler love story.",9,15 October 2015,"We've come to expect Adam Sandler's characters to be goofy , rage filled losers. But in Punch Drunk Love we see a background and reasoning behind this character. Barry Egan (Sandler) is a down on his luck novelty supplier. He is constantly bullied by his many sisters and can't seem to catch a break. But one day he meets an English woman named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) and his life finally finds companionship. In addition to this Barry is buying a large amount of pudding, and is being extorted by mattress salesman Dean Trumbell (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Trust me, you have to watch the movie to get it. Sandler does a great job in this movie. He can really act in this film. It shows us that Sandler's talents don't stop at making an annoying voice. I found the movie very enjoyable and I recommend it highly.",Punch-Drunk Love
81,CountZero313,I want to smash your face in,9,29 April 2011,"The unlikely pairing of Adam Sandler and Emily Watson pays dividends in this off-kilter comedy about a down-trodden loner discovering his own potential through love, and an air miles marketing cock-up.Sandler is Barry Egan, a mildly successful but chronically lonely self-employed businessman. The sole brother to seven sisters who torture him relentlessly, the pain of his formative years is hinted at by an incident where he launched a hammer at glass patio doors.Three things enter Barry's life simultaneously - a harmonium, an ad for air miles promotion that seems too good to be true, and Lena. The harmonium follows a horrific car crash, and crashes, explosions and collisions pepper the narrative to symbolise Barry's inner turmoil. There is external chaos, too, when Barry wreaks havoc at a family party, and then in a restaurant bathroom on a date with Lena. When Barry's vulnerability is exploited by the unscrupulous, Barry's inner rage finds righteous outlet when the bad guys injure Lena in their attempts to exploit Barry.There is lots of pathos, wacky humour and gritty emotion, with strong supporting performances from big names Luis Guzmán and Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Lesser-known players such as Hazel Mailloux as sister Rhonda hold their own in the intensity stakes. The stand-out element, however, is Sandler, who gives a nuanced, complex portrayal that no one guessed he had in him. Like Jim Carey with Eternal Sunshine, PDL is an outlet for comedic talent plus that extra something. Brave, insightful casting from Anderson.Lot of moments to treasure here, but my favourite is Barry seeking psychological counselling from a dentist. Fresh, fun, inventive, with lots of oomph, this is one of the few films I can watch again and again.",Punch-Drunk Love

Anderson delivers 3 from 3, a very rare feat in this modern cinema era. The film is a mixture of art house style indie cinema and comedy. It won't appeal to the average Sandler crowd, but indie buffs will enjoy it due to Anderson behind the camera.",Punch-Drunk Love
83,bopdog,"Amazing & marvelous! Makes ""Magnolia"" look like ""The Brady Bunch"" in comparison...",10,2 November 2002,"Pleasing shocker--- Everything you love about the meaty, textured depth of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, AND everything you love about Adam Sandler. Who'd of thunk it? The combo sounds totally weird, but it really, really works. This movie is amazing on every level. It's not an ""Adam Sandler movie"" as most of us know it--- but now that he's made this one, we must revise the category. Myself, I've always enjoyed his work. ""Punch Drunk Love"" is not a departure from that earlier ouevre, but is a natural blossoming. Think of ""Punch Drunk"" as ""The Waterboy"" on LSD, filmed by Ingmar bergan on ecstacy.The supporting cast is also brilliant. Phillip Seymor Hoffman once again defeats his Oscar chances by being SO amazing and SO brilliant and SO convincing that (1) we don't recognize him from ANY of his earlier work, and (2) exists only as the character, not as an actor playing the character. He is so good he makes it look effortless. Beyond effortless--- you forget you're even seeing a character, and suspect merely that you just encountered a piece of life.Emily Watson is very believable and lovely and loving. And those sisters! Yikes! Without even making them out as villains, we the audience can easily see how Barry Eagan (or whatever Sandler's character'sname is) became the way he is. And that Guzman dude was also right on target. Superb casting, acting, and direction all around.And talk about a mind-trip. ""Punch druink Love"" makes ""Magnolia"" look like ""The Brady Bunch."" Heck... it even makes ""Momento"" look like ""Starsky and Hutch."" Go see this movie. You'll love it! A clear and deserving ""10"" out of ""10.""",Punch-Drunk Love
84,Dan1863Sickles,Adam Sandler's Unique Screen Persona -- The Whining Bully,1,3 March 2006,"Charlie Chaplin was the Little Tramp. Kicked around and mistreated, he always retained his hope, his kindness and his jaunty walk. Adam Sandler has taken the comic little man persona in an entirely new direction -- he's the sniveling tough guy, the twitchy mama's boy, the whining bully.In this movie, Adam Sandler does pointless, stupid things, then reacts with screaming, Hitler-like tantrums whenever his own actions start to boomerang and hit him in the behind. The story line, of a small time salesman going over the edge, has been a cliché ever since Willy Loman's sanity gave way in Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN. But at least Willy was a full grown man with a wife and sons he tried to provide for. Adam Sandler seems to exist at the age of 13 forever, flying into a rage every time his sisters call him ""gay boy."" Who exactly is supposed to identify with this character? Emily Watson, refined and very beautiful, is hopelessly out of place in this strange, self-indulgent movie. Not that a romantic comedy featuring a classy lady and a two-bit jerk was a bad idea to start with. Perhaps if the Sandler character were forced to clean up his act, and learn something about himself, in order to become worthy of the stunning English beauty, the movie might have made sense. But no, all the guy does is go right on throwing temper tantrums left and right, screaming and frothing at the mouth, while the exquisite Emily Watson just stares at him in a daze. The movie ends with her blank confusion filling the screen, and perhaps that's the most appropriate image.",Punch-Drunk Love
85,PersianPlaya408,A great film from Paul Thomas Anderson,8,9 August 2006,"This quirky love-story worked for me from Paul Thomas Anderson. I thought it was much more effective than the overrated Boogie Nights and its even a bit better than the stunning Magnolia from Anderson. Here he allows Sandler to be funny, yet emotional and the performance works. Emily Watson is fabulous in the female lead while Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman were also good in supporting roles. The screenplay is written extremely well by Anderson and his odd directing patterns actually work in this situation. I liked this film because the direction, score, cinematography, acting and atmosphere all matched and helped the director tell the story. John Brion's score, Robert Elswit's cinematography and Leslie Jones editing are all very good here. Although i still prefer Michael Gondry's Eternal Sunshine to this, as Punch-Drunk Love's ending was a bit lacking and not as perfect of a film all-around as Eternal Sunshine, plus Carey was much more convincing in comparison to Sandler (who was also good though). This film is still very good, entertaining and a must-see for any fan of cinema. --- IMDb Rating: 7.4, my rating: 9/10",Punch-Drunk Love
86,skepticskeptical,"Original, but in a very weird way",6,1 April 2020,"No one can deny that Punch Drunk Love is an original film. But the take-away message is a bit disconcerting and either banal or false. All you need is love? Every pot has a lid? Stand by your man?The Adam Sandler character appears to suffer from a fairly serious mental disorder (random outbursts of violence) conjoined with a some sort of autism. He is basically an oddball who cannot relate to people, and when he gets upset he does things like destroys the bathroom of a restaurant or crashes the sliding glass windows at his sister´s birthday party with a hammer. Okay. So, pretty violent dude.In comes a cute little British blonde who for some unknown reason has fallen in love with this guy. She pursues him on the basis of a family photo she saw only because Adam´s sister is her co-worker. Love makes everything better. Or does it? He still seems extremely violent, although more provoked by wrongs done to him than by his inner demons. But what will he do when his new love interest meets somebody else or goes back to England? I ask because violent men tend to be very hard for women to leave, even when they begin battering them viciously. Some of the women end up dead.Cinematographically, the film´s grittiness well reflects the content of the film, so that is at least consistent, if not very aesthetically appealing. This really looks like it was made on a video camera. Was it? I have to ask.Anyway, this is certainly a unique experience, despite the dubious life lessons imparted.",Punch-Drunk Love
87,movieguy1021,Punch-Drunk Love: 10/10,10,6 July 2003,"Could Adam Sandler be turning into Jim Carrey? They both started out in slob comedies (Billy Madison, Ace Ventura), then tried their hand at serious acting (Punch-Drunk Love, The Majestic), and now has done a combination (Punch-Drunk Love again, Anger Management). Just like Carrey can be a good actor when he tries, so can Sandler. His work in this movie really blew me away. Just like Philip Seymour Hoffman does in most of his movies (besides this one), he can play a sad-sack loser very well.The real winner, however, is the script by the director, Paul Thomas Anderson. It's simply beautiful in its simplicity. It sounds like a basic story, a man with his own small business, but it soon transcends into one of the most original stories I have ever seen. Besides that, it shows basically everything from Sandler's point of view. His love interest, the charming Emily Watson, is underwritten, but that's because we know about as much about her as Sandler (Barry Egan) does. It's very hard to explain, you just need to see it to understand.The beautifully done plot has Barry working at his own company, one that produces plungers, or `fungers', as he calls them. He's dominated by his seven sisters; for instance, three of them call to make sure he's going to a party in about three minutes, during an important meeting. He's lonely, and one day, on a whim calls a phone-sex company, who takes all of his information. Barry is asked the next day by the person he had phone-sex with for money, but when Barry doesn't give any to her, her siblings, including the hilarious Dean Trumbell (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go out and try to get money from him. Soon, however, Barry falls in love with Lena (Watson), adding another interesting point to the plot.Although the subplot with Barry and Lena doesn't come into play until about half of the movie has been seen, it's probably the most substantial out of everything: his business, phone-sex, and purchasing pudding to gather frequent flyer miles (someone actually did this). Watson gave the charm needed for her role, and I believed the romance between the two. With only knowing one character for 90 minutes, and one for 45, it's amazing what Anderson's script did. The pudding played a larger role as the movie went on, and everything was involved with each other.Like all good movies should, there's a whole lot of symbolism, most of which I didn't understand. In the beginning, a car flips over on the street and a small harmonium is dropped off by a truck. What they mean, I have no idea. The pudding, however, does: it's how Barry can work for whatever he wants. He almost always wears the color blue, and color plays an important role, although I don't know what either of them mean.Sandler puts in an amazing job in his loser role. He can play it extremely life like. However, I think the main reason I loved him in this role so much is because I could relate to him. I couldn't help but feeling like I was going to be Barry Egan when I grew up. He's exactly like me, and I now know what's going to happen to me when I become older. Plus, I loved his blue suit! Watson played her role like roles like that are supposed to be: charming and cute. She did that to perfection. Everyone's favorite, Luis Guzman, puts in his usual supporting role.The cinematography was simply amazing. It wasn't like the films of today, where there are cuts every two seconds. Instead, entire scenes were done with one take, and one long, sweeping camera movement. Amazing is what you could say to describe this short, but mesmerizing film that will sweep you off your feet.My rating: 10/10Rated R for strong language including a scene of sexual dialogue.",Punch-Drunk Love
88,jlthornb51,One Reason to See this Film,9,18 April 2015,"This unusual Adam Sandler film is interesting but it is Emily Watson who lights up the screen with a performance that is absolutely electric. Her smile is heart melting, her eyes mesmerizing, and her talent overwhelming. Every scene in which she appears is hers alone. This is indeed an actress of unequaled ability and she makes Lena come alive as no one else could. There is no other actress in cinema who could play this part and make it totally believable. She shines like a super nova on screen and it impossible to take one's eyes off her. Without her, this would be another Adam Sandler fiasco but she raises even him to an heretofore unknown level. Class, beauty, brains, and an astonishingly gifted actress, Ms. Emily Watson.",Punch-Drunk Love
89,WriterDave,"Yeah, No, It was Great",8,5 July 2003,"P. T. Anderson is clearly the most nervous auteur working today. I imagine him as David Lynch crossed with Woody Allen. And that's basically what you get here with his extremely self-conscious, overtly symbolic, and meticulously crafted mondo-bizarro romantic comedy/drama ""Punch Drunk Love.""Every little detail has meaning and double meaning, from the camera angles (they're off center when the characters are) to the colors (and how bright and lush they are) to the actual events in the film (the piano dropping in the street, the car crash, etc...) Clearly this is meant to be a work of art, but it's also a rather slight film bogged down by its own quirkiness (the subplots involving ""Healthy Choice"" frequent flier miles and a shady phone-sex operation are hit and miss) and slim running time. In the era of overblown three hour epics, I never thought I would be complaining about a movie being only ninety-minutes long, and it all seems especially strange from P. T. Anderson, whose last film ""Magnolia"" clocked in at a burdensome three hours. The running time seems like yet another overtly self-conscious decision by the filmmaker, or could just be a result of how slight this simple ""strange-boy"" meets ""nice-girl"" movie actually is.However deliberate all the artistic touches are, I don't think this film is a deep as many have claimed. It most certainly is not about autism (which one reviewer on IMDb proposed), nor do I think P.T. Anderson meant to show us the symptoms of any particular psychological disorder. If he did, it was by accident, much like David Lynch accidentally displays distinct disorders in his films. I take the director's word for it when he said that this was simply his take on a Adam Sandler film. Sandler plays the same character in every film, a semi-oppressed man child with anger management issues and a surprising sweet side. It's just that in this film, a real director and artist decided to display that character, which makes this the best Adam Sandler film ever, though that's really not saying much when you think about it. (A side note: Emily Watson is fantastic as always, and you almost can imagine a shadow movie co-existing with the one you are watching where we see things from her point-of-view and everything is probably much more interesting).In the end, the best way to view this film is by ignoring what everyone else has said about it, keep an open mind, and laugh if you want to. You may enjoy it, you may not, but you'll never feel like you had two hours robbed from your life because it's just too slight. You be the judge if that's a good thing or not. Yeah, no, it is.",Punch-Drunk Love
90,cardsrock,Sandler showcases his range,8,10 April 2020,"I wish Adam Sandler would do more dramatic roles because he really is a good actor. He's terrific here and carries most of the film based on his layered, multi-faceted performance. The film is PTA doing what PTA does, putting his unique spin the overdone rom-com formula. This definitely is the most arthouse-y rom-com I've ever seen. It's often bizarre and weird, but also touching and inventive. It's not immediately accessible, but it ultimately wins you over.

This is Adam Sandler's first serious film and I think that this movie is probably one of his bests. I thought he was great in the film and PTA has a great connection with having his main characters be the best, (Mark Whalberg, Tom Cruise, and Adam Sandler). Usually in PTA's films, their revolving around different characters in his stories and this movie was very different from the last three because it really only revolved one person named Barry Egan (Adam Sandler). His struggles with his job and people until he meets a woman he falls for is all wrapped around this bizarre comedy. Overall, really good film but truly bizarre in ways. PTA's films are an attraction for tons of viewers. I recommend the film.Hedeen's Outlook: 9/10 ***+ A-",Punch-Drunk Love
92,garethcrook,Sandler's best film (with little competition),8,5 May 2020,"I like Paul Thomas Anderson films, mostly. I hate Adam Sandler films, unequivocally. Even his latest 'Uncut Gems', although I kinda enjoyed, I also hated. This though, is supposed to be the exception. To cut to the chase, it is. I'm not sure it's as much to do with Sandler as it is with PTA, who's not afraid of the quirky and unusual... and this is both. Sandler plays Barry, a socially awkward hardware salesman. An only son with 7 sisters, big family, lots of pressure. Single and confused. I have to give him some credit, he captures Barry's insecurities very well. You feel for Barry, he's lonely, anxious, trying to do his best. His teasing sisters, Georgia from the phone sex service hassling him, Barry has a lot on his mind. Add to that the driving music high in the mix and scenes that build with the intensity of a runaway jackhammer and it gets pretty tense. I'm enjoying it, then Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman) turns up and it goes from good to great. Just as things seem to be getting better for Barry when he meets Lena (Emily Watson) and goes on a date, Dean's henchmen come to ruin him. Dean you see is behind the phone sex scam, ""we know where you live"", ""we'll expose you"" and Barry's in a tailspin. Barry however has a plan to escape to Hawaii, with the help of some chocolate puddings and some extreme couponing. I know that sounds nuts, but Barry is a little. He's frenetic, prone to punching walls, occasionally finds solace in an old harmonium he found out on the street and is enthralling to watch. As Barry's confidence grows, so does his impulsiveness, this not only helps his love life, but fuels his desire to right the wrongs of Dean in true get the girl, kill the baddies style. I will still do my best to avoid Sandler movies, but this, I have to confess is rather magical.",Punch-Drunk Love
93,christophe92300,Odd,3,5 June 2013,"The movie starts off by a very boring first part that serves as an introduction for the very troubled Barry played by an excellent Adam Sandler, who represents actually the only satisfaction of the film even though his character is difficult to figure out and most importantly too caricatural.Then after 45 minutes, finally starts what is supposed to be the ""heart"" of the movie, namely the love story. Yet, this romance doesn't work because it lacks substance and credibility. And it's impossible to think this feature is labelled as a comedy because it is nowhere near to funny.But the most irritating aspect of Punch-Drunk Love is assuredly the soundtrack: indeed, the music is omnipresent and it gets annoying, almost giving you a massive headache. Paul Thomas Anderson probably thought it would keep the viewer awake faced with this insipid and incoherent scenario.",Punch-Drunk Love
94,ruby_fff,The sound effects & music can very well be the third character besides Sandler and Watson's pairing,7,3 November 2002,"You might say ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the sweeter side of writer-director-producer Paul Thomas Anderson - not without his trademark spicy acumen, with an uncanny* flavorful pairing of Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. It's not raining frogs - it's a harmonium. It's not 3 hours 8 minutes long but simply an hour and a half.  It feels like following a comic book story - quite enjoyable and curiously amusing.*It's uncanny only to the extent if you've not appreciated Sandler's talent before, or have not tasted the versatile comedic subtlety of Ms. Watson as in ""Trixie.""  I actually rather enjoy Adam Sandler's 1999 good-hearted comedy ""Big Daddy"", and appreciate his effort of ""Mr. Deeds,"" the remake of Gary Cooper's 1936 ""Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"" a Frank Capra wholesome classic.PT Anderson is quite a storyteller. He weaves tales of ordinary characters yet somehow delivers not so ordinary happenings.  If you believe in fantasy or dreams, the effect would be wonderful, warm and fuzzy all over. Here in ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" he includes audio and visual palette complementing the filmic experience. There are interludes of broad colorful brush strokes clear across the screen. The sound effects & music enhance the various bewildering mind-cluttered, wistful longing or scurrying situations that Barry Egan (Sandler's character) is going through. Harry Nilsson's song ""He needs me"" certainly strikes the inner chord at the precise predicament. I thoroughly enjoy the episode how Sandler responds to Lena's (Watson's character) 'hypnotic' phone call handed to him by the Security, how he's up and down the stairwells and hallways - quick, what is that apartment number, indeed. Anderson's poignant attention to little details is heartfelt.
And if you think it's a mere love story, not quite. There are twists and turns, action sequences, chase scenes, if you will - smashing things and swear words not lacking. In the end, it's kinda like an urban fairy tale - of love, of course.Emily Watson's recent appearance opposite Ralph Fiennes in ""Red Dragon"" was a quiet assuring performance (even with a touch of humor in spite of the suggestive horror). She is definitely talented, taking on diverse roles, small supporting ones notwithstanding.The 1997 ""Boogie Nights"" (2 hr. 35 mins.) written and directed by PT Anderson, with a tour de force ensemble cast of Mark Wahlberg in the lead role, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly and Philip Baker Hall (both were in Anderson's 1996 debut feature ""Hard Eight"" with Gwyneth Paltrow), Luis Guzman and Philip Seymour Hoffman (both also in ""Punch-Drunk Love""), and brilliant Alfred Molina in a brief appearance, is certainly worth seeing.",Punch-Drunk Love

96,moviemanMA,A New Side of Sandler,10,4 July 2005,"Adam Sandler is known for his wacky, flaky, and sometimes over the top style of comedy. With films like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy under his belt, one would think that he would stick with what he's got. Sandler has shown us a new side of him with his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love.Sandler plays Barry Egan, an ambitious man who owns and operates his own business. He sells his own plungers. One day after finishing a phone call with a food company, he walks outside to find a tiny piano someone dropped on the side of the road. He runs after it and puts it in his office. Then shortly after he meets Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) who needs help with her car. Being the nice guy he is, he complies.Barry Egan is a great guy. He is nice and is trying his best to do well. With seven sisters, he faces the brunt of their vicious wrath that they unintentionally place upon him. With embarrassing stories of growing up and how they teased him, Barry has a little built up anger that he uses here and there, like his sister's sliding glass door. Barry means well, but man can he do damage.When lonely one night, Barry calls a sex line for just someone to talk to. What he ends up getting himself into is a huge scandal with the operator of the sex line due to the fact that he gave his credit card number to them and everything they need to know to get money from him. On top of this, Barry has found a way to cheat the food company he talks to in the beginning. The deal is getting free frequent-flyer miles due to a deal the company has on all of their items...including individual pudding cups. Barry pounces on the opportunity by buying as many 25 cent cups as he can so he can fly anywhere for free.With an interesting plot and a great performance by both Sandler and Watson, this film is bound to make an impact. Sandler's more dramatic side shows, giving us a glimpse at the real actor behind all of the goofy nonsense we have come to love over the years. It was really refreshing to see a comedian do a really good job acting in a serious role. It reminded me of Jim Carey is The Truman Show. Serious, yet still able to crack a joke, much like Sandler in this film.Anderson is no newcomer when it comes to movies. He has written and directed a couple of gems. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two he both wrote and directed and came out great. This movie is no different. It's unique style with interesting choices for music give the picture an edge.If Sandler keeps landing roles like this, he could potentially put himself in position for an Oscar nomination, much like Bill Murray did with Lost in Translation. That's not to say he shouldn't make his regular comedies, but a nice blend would be great. Punch Drunk Love is a knockout!",Punch-Drunk Love
97,Flagrant-Baronessa,Extract the worst elements of Adam Sandler productions and combine with the most annoyingly kooky ideas of Paul Thomas Anderson,3,20 December 2006,"For a frame of reference, I thoroughly enjoyed Boogie Nights (1997) and thought Magnolia (1999) was just quirky and insightful enough to be a truly great film. I hated Punch-Drunk Love (2002) with an unspeakable passion. This is a romantic comedy, hedged around with kooky mystery and a puzzling score both of which escalate as the nonsensical story plays on and soon the cumulative effect is one mess of an artsy film an unbearable, tortuous romp in which you want nothing more than for Paul Thomas Anderson to get off his high artsy-fartsy horse and present us something with story and substance.Adam Sandler has not transformed himself into a dramatic actor at all, as critics and fans gush. He is still stuck in the pathetic goofball stage, scraping by with deliberate tragicomic effect, which in all fairness, he does quite well. The discernible difference is that the context in Punch-Drunk Love is much sadder than in 'Big Daddy' or 'Happy Gilmore' and Sandler inhabits an intrinsically pathetic character  a wreck of a small business-owner under the thumb of his SEVEN hounding sisters  he is a lost soul with no sense of direction in life. When he begins to show fits of rage and bouts of spontaneous crying, he realises he needs change. He gets entangled in a phone-sex company, meets a soul-mate (Emily Watson) and stands up against his sisters.The template story may seem a straightforward and well-sketched one on paper, but director Paul Thomas Anderson warps every element of the plot in impossible ways, creating a daft, desperately quirky mixed bag of narrative styles. With Anderson, no characters, dialogue or meetings serve as plot-fodder. They are twisted moments of fate, illogic and neat coincidences, which is why you cannot help but feel as though Punch-Drunk Love is never going anywhere, but instead gets sidetracked into millions of puzzling detours and diversions. This makes it difficult to articulate the film's shortcomings  the style is a peculiar one, and you may love it or hate it. I subscribe to the latter, at least in this film.The good/bad news is that Anderson has clearly mastered all film techniques: the twisted logic, the role of fate, the importance of symbolism, multiple story lines and the infamous Scorsese-tracking shot  but boy, his script is no strong point. The story of Adam Sandler as Barry Egan in Punch-Drunk Love is warped, to no discernible end. The music score is puzzling to the point of distracting the viewer  undoubtedly an intentionally-integrated device to mask its poor writing. The style consumes the substance and soon there are only faint traces of actual plot development left. R.I.P. story.The beginning of the film gets a surprising amount of things right: the irritating sisters who gang up on Barry makes us nod with recognition (although I have no sisters, I can relate immensely), we can clearly see the neatly-contained anger within Barry bubble up and seep into his character, and he captures the outbursts of rage fairly well. I suppose the accolades abruptly end here because I struggle to find something even remotely smirkworthy or insightful in the rest of the film.3 out of 10",Punch-Drunk Love
98,willcundallreview,A RomCom with a lot of precision,7,31 August 2014,"Punch-Drunk Love is a genuinely sweet film that also gives you laughs, weird music and Adam Sandler not being a presence destined for failure. With it's slick script but also tender directing, this film really showcases some major points which I will go over in the review but also leaves you really quite like ""what happened"" as it is so fast. I felt the film was strongly a good movie and here below is why I felt that about it.The story is nice and is interesting from start to finish in truth and with it's romantic but funny overtones, this is really a film to watch if your sad or just plain bored. I particularly liked the slight twist that is seen roughly half way through the film in which (wait no spoilers) well anyway it provides a nice thrill that runs all the way to very end. It maybe isn't the most tender and heart pulling romance but still try's hard to keep it quirky and new which is pretty nice to see.Adam Sandler provides a performance in this that is actually good and his crazily strange character of Barry Egan really shows that Sandler can act well when he wants to. Emily Watson is good and contributes nicely to the more sweet parts of the film which is one thing that makes this so good, it can be sweet yet dark at times to create a great balance. Actors such as Phillip Seymour Hoffman contribute excellently to an overall very good cast who do the job well.Paul Thomas Anderson is probably the main reason I enjoyed this movie so much, his directing is calm and sophisticated and even when the pace gets faster the transition to it is done perfectly. His writing skill is also very good and the comedic value of the script along with the very romantic parts so often seen in this movie make this not just a film where you want to smile at funny moments, but also at the loving parts.I guess it could be said this isn't the best Romantic film because maybe more comedy was wanted and some of the more serious moments can be over done by trying for laughs. I liked the cinematography for this but there are times(although very few) where you feel the camera is just following a character for too long and it can make the scenes kind of dull also, but not many criticisms come from the film in my opinion.If you want a caring film this could be for you and although sometimes Sandler's brand of very physical humour comes through, you should at least get a few laughs for Barry. This for me wasn't a soppy kind of love movie but some could see it that way and although the comedy should drown that part of it out, nevertheless don't watch this if you hate a lot of romantic moments(without comedy).I felt it was Strongly a Good movie and actually quite close to being very good as well. This film is hugely enjoyable but it could be to do with what mood your in so try not to watch if in truth you want something more thrilling. For the Adam Sandler connoisseur you may not see the same Adam you so often get to see in his comedies although Barry Egan is a funny man and you can at moments really see that Adam Sandler gives a performance that has a certain degree of care.",Punch-Drunk Love
99,majikstl,Jerry Lewis meets Joe Pesci...,6,16 May 2004,"PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE features a new and improved Adam Sandler. The problem is that even a new and improved Adam Sandler is still an Adam Sandler. Paul Thomas Anderson's noble (or foolhardy) attempt to put Sandler's ultra-annoying screen persona into a workable dramatic context can only work so far. At the heart of the film he still has to deal with Sandler, a comic of minimal talent and limited range who is, at best, an acquired taste.Of course, such miracles have occurred before. Take for instance Martin Scorsese's clever resurrection of Jerry Lewis' career for THE KING OF COMEDY. And Sandler has stolen a good deal of his shtick from Jerry: The infantile behavior, the phony attempts at pathos, the tendency for loud outbursts of violence (though Lewis' were slapstick and Sandler's seem genuinely just mean-spirited). The fundamental difference between the two is that Jerry begs us for love, while Adam dares us to. To the extent that PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE works, it is based on Anderson's realization that underneath the dopey facade of Sandler's screen persona is a character of almost frightening emotional and mental instability. For all of his dimwitted gags and heavy-handed mugging, Sandler, on screen, is one heck of a scary guy. Sort of Jerry Lewis meets Joe Pesci. To accommodate this, Anderson has concocted a story tailor-made for Sandler, yet striving to be something a good deal more. He almost succeeds.Sandler plays Barry Egan, an emotional basketcase. Oppressed by his brood of overbearing sisters, sexually frustrated and emotionally stunted, Barry is teetering on the verge of a breakdown. Into his life comes, in no particular order, a mysterious lady in red (who proves to be a rather likable stalker), a harmonium (a tiny piano) and a blackmail scheme hooked up to a phone-sex hotline. The stalker is adorable, rather than scary. The piano is a cute, but labored prop. And the blackmail scheme is so ludicrous that every time it intrudes on the story all the film's credibility is shot. There is also a subplot involving Barry's obsession with buying Healthy Choice pudding, which is an amusing, silly distraction.All this is served up with a style of quirkiness that is anything but quirky. Anderson tries too hard. Like Anderson's other films, PUNCH-DRUNK tries to be too many different things, but here that scattershot approach doesn't work. He has a simple story focusing on one man, it requires a simple approach.But the film has its moments, thanks less to Barry than to his would-be stalker, Lena, played with genuine quirkiness by the ever-quirky Emily Watson. She single-handedly gives the film the light, absurd tone that Anderson strives for, and which Sandler could never dream of acquiring. One wonders why Anderson didn't strive to build a film around her.But the film always comes back to one central problem: Adam Sandler. The man -- or at least his screen persona -- is just not likable. For us to stick with Barry until the end, we have to have some sort of empathy for him. Sandler's crying jags almost lure us in, but his whininess and temper tantrums push us away. But the fact that we are at least tempted to like him has to represent some sort of milestone in the comedian's career.",Punch-Drunk Love
100,joelwatchesmovies,A wonderfully and uniquely constructed character study,9,9 January 2019,"Delightfully bizarre-within-the-mundane (our lead has seven sisters and sells novelty plungers in a big storage locker) and artfully and purposefully constructed (the loud and constant soundtrack, sudden sounds, tracking shots, zooms all envelope us in Barry's anxiety; the colour flares are a cool touch too). It's a well-acted character study of a man just trying to cope in this overwhelming world, and the solace and redemption he finds strike all the right chords after so much dissonance.

101,avik-basu1889,I hate Sandler even more after watching this !!!!!,9,2 November 2014,"Paul Thomas Anderson and Adam Sandler, most film lovers and critics won't expect these two planets to collide in the cinematic universe and if they do, as with most Sandler films, you would expect the collision to end with catastrophic consequences. Well, this movie proves that even Adam Sandler can create something great under the guidance of a master director.At the basic level, Punch-Drunk Love is a romantic comedy, but when it is being made by a director like Paul Thomas Anderson, the film will always be different from the stereotypical rubbish that is created week in,week out in that genre. I love it when master directors take on a project that is not really similar to the kind of films that he/she has made in his/her career previously, but still makes it perfectly. Another example of this is Scorsese's Hugo. You can see Anderson's touch and style all over this film. The beautiful visuals, the style of the narrative, the soundtrack,etc. all point to Anderson. The film is about a man named Barry Egan(Sandler) who is suffering from depression and anxiety. He finds a lot of discomfort to blend in and interact with people in social gatherings. He is idiosyncratic with his behaviour. He can be adorably gentle at times, but he is also prone to violent outbursts of rage. He comes into contact with a mysterious lady named Lena(Emily Watson) and things start happening.Emily Watson is extremely brilliant here. She is always mysterious. There is seemingly always a reticent mystery in her eyes whenever we see her. But she also is extremely likable. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a guest role in this film, but he makes his presence felt in the limited amount of screen time that he has,as you would expect. But really, this movie belongs to Adam Sandler. He shows genuine acting talent here. This role of Barry Egan was never an easy one. He is asked to play a person who is disturbingly dangerous in one scene and adorable in the next. Sandler portrays this character in a flawless manner with subtle physical gestures, facial expressions, vocal adjustments,etc. He has never since been as good as this. Paul Thomas Anderson uses a lot of visual symbolism in the film. The piano, the colours and the light flares on the screen, the colours of the dresses worn by the characters,etc. The plot is very simple on the surface, but has depth if you read between the lines.The score used by Anderson is breathtakingly upbeat and adds a devastating intensity in the scenes and is essential to the plot.This film confirms Paul Thomas Anderson's versatility in my eyes as a director and he really will go down as one of the greats of American cinema. But what this film really proves is that Sandler can be good when he wants to be. This really makes me hate Adam Sandler even more by thinking that he went from this to Just Go With It and Grown Ups 2.",Punch-Drunk Love
102,cat_ranchero,Quirky... But fun!...,7,2 December 2012,"Without doubt the best performance I've seen from Adam Sandler; he suits the role perfectly and plays it with just the right amount of craziness. Also worthy of note; Emily Watson who becomes a kind of kindred spirit to Sandler's slightly off-kilter character. A small role for Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays the boss of the sex line company, Dean Trubmbell, he is great on screen as ever. It's all beautifully shot with several surprise moments along the way that give the film the kind of edginess it needs. A very quirky musical score by Jon Brion plays along in the background giving an interesting meter to the on-screen action. Over all, I did enjoy it, but maybe not quite as much as I expected to. Having said that, it is a film I'd like to see again some day because I feel there is a lot more to it than first appears.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.1/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Punch-Drunk Love
103,richard_sleboe,The pudding plot,7,25 February 2008,"A quaint, enjoyable movie about a regular kind of guy you wouldn't give a second glance if not for the sheer oddity of his personal issues. Humiliated by evil sisters until well into his adult life, Barry resorts to desperate measures to claim his stake as a businessman and as a budding lover. Fine performance by Adam Sandler, reminiscent of his appearances as a reluctant heir in ""Mr. Deeds"" and as a workaholic in ""Click"". Real-life scenes are inter-cut with semi-abstract frames in brilliant colors, showing Barry's world as if seen from the inside of a lava lamp. Fine performance by Luis Guzmán in the part of Barry's right-hand man Lance. Bewildered by Barry's outlandish scheme to make it big with Healthy Choice vouchers for free airline miles, Lance acts as an on-screen proxy for the astonished audience. About half an hour into the movie, there's a great scene as Barry steps into the empty street in front of his warehouse. Standing motionless, he is pictured from three different angles. Set up in three different, but equally distant spots, the camera never moves during the actual shots. Although Barry is the center of the viewer's attention, the wide angle makes him seem thoroughly lost. It's like the minimalistic equivalent of John Woo's 360 degree revolution shots. Great stuff.",Punch-Drunk Love
104,mOVIemAN56,Sandler's Best Acting Job,9,9 May 2005,"I just watched this tonight and I absolutely loved it. Sandler is brilliant in an odd role for a big comedy role. Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a small time business owner. The only problem is that he suffers from periods of violent rages when his self-esteem lowers. He has seven sisters who torture him mercilessly about his past and his life. After a series of hard times Barry stumbles on a lucrative deal of accumulating frequent-flyer miles by buying Healthy Choice pudding. He takes it up as his hobby of gathering frequent-flyer. Soon his life takes a turn for the better when he meets a friend of his sister named Lena (Emily Watson) and the two begin to date.Before the two hit it off, Barry gets himself into a bad situation by giving his credit card number and social security number to an adult sex phone line and is now being constantly threatened by a mysterious lady and her boss, Dean (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Now a gang of four brothers begin to torment him and rob him. Barry takes it until the gangs finally reaches Lena and Barry is pushed over the edge. The movie is one of self-respect and overcoming all odds. Even while Barry is being tormented by his sisters and the gang he finds happiness and strength through Lena. The movie is a very dark comedy and has some strong language but is all used to express Barry overcoming the control of his sisters. One of the best examples is when he chases Lena to Hawaii and wants a telephone number to her room. His sister begins to tease him, Barry breaks out into a violent verbal dispute saying that he won't have the crap of his controlling sisters and demands the number, which is given.The film has some laughs in it but holds it dark comedy story and proves Sandler has talent and unlimited range. This is the best Adam Sandler film I've seen and one of the best of 2002. The story is fun, it's interesting, and it's touching. Emily Watson (not the one from the Harry Potter films) is strong as Sandler's mysterious and Philip Seymour Hoffman continues his streak of the most under-appreciated supporting actor in Hollywood.Punch-Drunk Love.

105,aromatic-2,The novelty wears thin quickly,3,26 October 2002,"Adam Sandler does an excellent job acting the bi-polar garage owner with a simpleton's naivete.  In fact, given the assinine dialogue, and the losers they were assigned to portray, the entire cast does a good job attempting to stretch their acting muscles in service of this mess. 
But, there are two miserably absurd plots -- an annoyingly stupid and violent back-and-forth about four stupid brothers who try to collect blackmail money on behalf of their sister, a phone-sex hostess.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is totally wasted as the mentor of these five losers -- presumably the father but I'm not clear on that.  The other is even more disappointing because Emily Watson, one of the most talented young actresses around today (Hillary and Jackie, Breaking the Waves, Luzhin Defence, etc.), gets to play a beautiful and successful fantasy who just seems to be waiting for dysfunctional cretin Sandler to enter her life, and she is given no character of her own.  What a waste!",Punch-Drunk Love
106,happipuppi13,Why Punch-Drunk Love is Sandler's Best,10,26 August 2006,"After watching this film on DVD last night,I decided it was perfect for my 100th review on here. Mainly because it was better than I expected. I cleared my mind when I sat down to watch because I didn't want to go in with any pre-conceived ideas like comparing it to his past comedies.This movie really is not a comedy,it has comedic elements but it's really a lot deeper than that. This is a serious look at a man (Barry Egan) who has nothing to show for his life but a business that,outside of his lonely apartment,he practically lives at. He's lonely,depressed,is filled with repressed rage and anger having been belittled by his sisters & family all of his life.They seem to want Barry to never forget how he one night busted a glass window by throwing a hammer through it when they kept calling him ""gay boy"". Too much of that has made Barry introverted and/or anti-social. He engages in behavior like buying up Healthy Choice meals because they're offering frequent flier miles with each purchase. This is a very lonely,bored and miserable man.Into his life,in quite a bizarre manner,comes Lena Leonard. A woman who is a bit off the wall herself because she drops a ""harmonium"" (little piano) into the street for Barry to have and gives him her car early in the morning because she wants him to take it to the repair shop. All just to meet him.Now,I wont spell out the whole movie here but I can tell you it's overall point. The theme here is what becomes of the human condition when people are treated less than human and also what can happen when it seems all hope is lost in a life that seems to have ground to a halt.Someone here asked,""Who can possibly relate to this""? Well,anybody who has been the subject of ridicule like Barry and... also anyone who knows how to really pay attention to this film when watching it. I can relate to a lot of what Barry feels because he is treated like an outcast when hes really done harm to no one. A long time ago,people treated me that way but unlike Barry here,I didn't let it get the best of me and I learned to grow past it.I urge all here who gave this a negative review to go back and watch again,really pay attention to everything and you'll get it too. I even got that,the between scene animation represents the moving of heaven & earth,when one's life changes for the better. It also simply represents love itself.Bravo Adam Sandler! I hope you make more movies like this! Happy 40th on 9/9/2006. (END)",Punch-Drunk Love
107,XxEthanHuntxX,A Suprising and Honest Rom-Com,9,16 September 2020,"A interesting resemblance I've seen people refer film to and especially this one is that film is like a crossword puzzle. Most of the times its a lot easier to do the longer words first, then you can kind of work your way out from there. But sometimes you can't solve the longer ones, and the shorter ones can be more helpful.And Punch-Drunk Love, in comparison to Paul Thomas Anderson's other movies, is a small one in every conceivable way be it cast size, narrative complexity and budget. Yet there is an attractive spontaneity here that is largely absent elsewhere. And it certainly feels very personal to the director, which creates a free environment, without the pressuring need to prove anything to the audience or critical expectation, just cheer passion and love for cinema.Adam Sandler, a huge Hollywood actor known for more noncomplex family friendly movies, which he has built up a character of a goofball comedian style. But Anderson has always demonstrated a skill for directing actors that nobody expected to get a performance from, and this magnitude out of Sandler was more than unexpected, very impressive. It helps that Barry is a distorted version of the comedy characters he has become famous for. There is an anger to nearly all his characters but here, rather than played purely for laughs there is also a crippling sadness to his frustrations as he struggles to understand the people around him: ""I don't know if there is anything wrong because I don't know how other people are."" This is also felt by the awesome soundtrack.",Punch-Drunk Love
108,jackasstrange,Great character study and a captivating and unpredictable story,9,20 February 2014,"Punch-Drunk-Love is great. Definitely on my list of best films from the 00s, because Paul Thomas Anderson reached excellence in this superb and complex character study that is also a comedy, after all - It stars Adam Samdler, in the best role of his career by far, with a considerable margin of difference between the 2nd and 1st.Adam Samdler shows talent interpreting the social introvert and anxious, Ibmean, he is really good in the film. He showed talent for once. I never expected him to do so, even knowing beforehand how good that film is. I always thought he wasn't a highlight, but he definitely is the highlight and is indeed the soul of Punch Drunk Love.Well, the story is simple, it shows the life of this anxious officer and what happens in his day-to-day life. Obviously, there is a lot of things in the film, and his life starts to become a mess when his sister forces him to meet her friend(interpreted by Emily Watson) and when he does a weird sex-call and refuses to play for the service. Yeah.There is a metaphor in the film that some may find interesting. He acquires super-strength in a few scenes and I even heard that the protagonist would be an allusion to the classic comic book character Superman. You have to find by yourself that 'meanings'. Anyway, that is a great and very personal film, highly recommended. 9.4/10",Punch-Drunk Love
109,smakawhat,A Complete Faliure,3,27 October 2002,"No I didn't go into this looking for a loopy Sandler flick.. No no no.. Sure I like Adam I do think he's quite a funny guy.  Do I care for his films, I would say the vast majority of them that I have witnessed I can't stand.Now it seems like Sandler has a vehicle to show off some talent, working behind the brilliant PT Anderson who directed this film to no doubt stand it up against his great past works like Magnolia, and Boogie Nights.  To even shelve this film beside those is an abomination.Punch Drunk Love is the story of a querky salesman who is the brother of 7 seemingly cruel sisters.  There isn't much of a plot but the story ends up going in 2 different directions when a shady business man decides to extort money from Sandler after he makes a call to a sex line.  Then one of the sisters introduces him to a casual friend and suddenly Sandler's character finds love.Other than that there's not much to go on so you hope that at some point you can latch on to the characters and feel for them.  Problem is you can't because they are empty and uninteresting.This FILM DRAGS on and then tries to even throw in comedic touches which get ZERO laughs.  There was not one peep, not one CHUCKLE during the entire time the funny gags in this film went on the screen in the theatre I had to witness this junk.  It seems PT Anderson could just throw in an annoying soundtrack, slick direction and colour (Which I admit is good) and what sounds like adlibed dialgoue with actors and it will work.  Sorry WRONG... I looked at my watch about 1 hour in thinking god this has to be over soon. I was ready to walk out, and then I thought OK I'll give it a chance.  Then a few more minutes later it luckily ended without any redeeming qualities.This film isn't that its bad, it's that it is a complete failure.  That's ""the"" word I can only associate with this film  It fails at everything, it fails to generate laughs, it fails in creating a love story, it fails in caring for Sandler or anyone involved, it fails to create resentment against the evil doers, it fails fails FAILS just at everything.

This character could easily be grotesque, but this stunt casting simply works. It's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Emily Watson is fine as the love interest who pulls him out of his shell. Why she's interested in this weird creature is never explained, but characters barely act human in this oddball lyrical tale. The music is fantastic, but as in all PT Anderson films it's beautiful to watch. DP Robert Elswit knocks it out of the park with one stunning shot after another.

111,bix171,Recommended With Reservations,8,25 October 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson's experimental romance is difficult and prickly, an aggressively insular work that makes very few concessions to its audience. It's also the work of a supremely gifted director and his excellent actors in search of a movie. Where `Magnolia' found Anderson blissfully embracing his large ensemble of misfits (the same type of people he humiliated in `Boogie Nights'), here he doesn't quite know what to make of the two characters (played by Adam Sandler and Emily Watson) he chooses to center on. They seem exaggerated and disconnected with the rest of the world and their reactions to their surroundings and each other are clearly unusual (their lovemaking, for example, involves violent imagery as endearments)--they seem almost like comic book characters. (It seems intentional. The similarities to Superman are great: Sandler's character's name has the same number of letters--Barry Egan/Clark Kent--and is seen only in the same blue suit with, as the film progresses, red ties; and his love interest's alliterative name--Lena Leonard--resembles Lois Lane.) Sandler is superb because the director doesn't try to reinvent his recognizable characteristics, just place his barely concealed rage in a different context than the usual slapstick. But that context itself is troubling: the rage here stems from lifelong abuse at the hands of his seven sisters and a phone-sex worker who tries to extort money, and aside from Watson's luminous redemptive powers (and even she's somewhat unstable) the film has nothing but contempt for women. Anderson's clearly out to upset the apple cart, bringing a percussive discomfit to a love story awash in pastels (the magnificent steadicam cinematography and drum-heavy score are by Anderson's brilliant collaborators Robert Elswit and Jon Brion respectively) and, while it's well-worth seeing, it's arty, an American-made foreign film filled with long, uncomfortable takes, very heavy pauses and the distinct feeling of being underwritten. It has a very peculiar rhythm and takes an inordinate amount of time to get started--if you're not with it by the second reel you stand a good chance of not getting with it at all.",Punch-Drunk Love

Love can change a person, and this movie uses that motto as a cornerstone to the plot and the mood. Adam Sandler emerges, shining in every single frame, and embodies the kind of collective character director Anderson so wisely created in ""Magnolia"". But here, the hero is no sex guru or lonely cop or game show host. Here a jaw-dropping Adam Sandler is the flesh of human loneliness, the abstract image of the common man that lives a regular, tedious life with some derangements and 7 nasty sisters to spice up things. When he meets doll-face Emily Watson, the elevation of man to Man is his character's greatest test. Shot in everyday grounds, the picture could even happen to be dull as the places where it happens. But Anderson shoots his main characters like the real heart of the movie, never minding the rest, and always remembering us that we may have nothing at all, but when we are blessed by love, nothing else matters anymore. Clever touches and much well-suceeded ambition rise this up to a ground of genius, and show once more that director Anderson can tackle anything as long as there is a heart to it.",Punch-Drunk Love
113,brenttraft,Film as Literature,10,6 November 2002,"It is ironic that during the previews before ""Punch-Drunk Love,"" there was a trailer for ""Maid in New York,"" a film that appears to perpetuate the myth that a man needs to have a successful career and gobs of money in order to find love with an attractive woman.  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the opposite of that.  It is the story of a man with serious emotional problems who does the best with what he has and finds love as a form of redemption.  It is not a comedy in the way of a TV sitcom, but rather it is full of absurd humor in the manner of Terry Gilliam or Fellini.  It uses symbols in the manner of poems and literature.In my view, the harmonium represents the opportunity for falling in love. The harmonium is literally dropped at his feet but he walks away.  After he meets Emily Watson, he runs back to get it but finds it does not work.  Then he repairs it and later gives it to her.The blue light reflecting into the camera lens represents the power of love. It follows Barry Egan throughout the film.The pudding represents opportunity.  It is a chance for him to get ahead.I almost did not see this film because I did not like P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights.""  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an intelligent, uplifting film which should win many of the critics awards after the year is over.

To cope with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone sex hotline and soon finds himself being extorted by the female operator and has four henchmen sent to collect money from Barry. Barry is also an entrepreneur as he plans to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and collect a million frequent flyer miles by buying large quantities of pudding which are sold at a very low price. To top this up Barry is also nudged towards a possible romantic relationship with Lena, a co-worker of his sister. It took me awhile to get where this film was going in particular from the odd moments that are played in the scene such as the very first 5 minutes of the flick where a car literally crashes and flies by and instantly a truck swings past very abrasively and drops a harmonium in front of Barry, Weird as there is no background or purpose of this. This might be due to the speed of the film is too quick and leaves you wondering what's going on. Sandler's shows he has the potential to act as a dramatic and explosive character. Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays the mattress man plays the baddie in this flick which he has a few scenes and you can tell his character is more bark and no bite. In particular the first telephone conversation both characters have is extremely funny and dramatic. Overall an interesting film which had awkward funny moment, 7/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

Unexpectedly sweet and comforting romantic-comedy that has Adam Sandler (in a good role for a change) as Barry Egan, a socially insecure owner of a small business in L.A. whose life takes a bizarre turn when one of his seven sisters sets him up on a date with Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).The result is like one of those classic love stories several decades ago. I'm not sure which one best resembles and ""The Graduate"" is definitely not my first pick.  Just watching Sandler and Watson in any scene of the movie makes me think of some people that I know fairly well and you know that they're meant to be together.However, Barry has some unfinished business to deal with when he called a suspicious phone sex service one night and refuses to pay up.  The head of the scam, Dean Trumbull (Philip Seymour Hoffman) sends four blonde-haired hoods to get the money from Barry one way or another.  The first confrontation between the hoodlums and Barry, then Barry and Dean, is good but disturbing.As for the movie, which was written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"", ""Boogie Nights"").  The story here is smart and deeply heartfelt which put the viewer under a strange spell of sorts.  Even the music and photography in this movie is astonishing.  Another thing, it's probably the best story that Sandler has been in and takes away the doubts.

Some of it does not even makes sense or feels implausible. But what grabbed my attention is the terrific presentation and extra ordinary soundtrack that elevates what goes on the screen. The story is actually a one liner but I am trying to extend it here. Barry (Sandler) is a loner with 7 sisters and feels constantly awkward about himself. To beat his loneliness, he once calls a phone sex line and divulges his contact information and financial status. Out of the blue he meets Lena and they both start to have mutual feelings. Just when he starts to step into a feeling of love he has never experienced before, his phone sex bit comes back to bite him in the form of blackmail and extortion. How he handles his love life and the threats comprise the overall premise. Performances are apt and the role is tailor made for Sandler which he has done countless times before and after. Paul Thomas Anderson converts these average performances and a shoe string of a story into a terrific screenplay by mixing a fantastic background score. The movie is crisp and never gets tired or boring. But there are quite a few loose ends that does not makes sense and looks like they were left that way intentionally.

Quite different and unusual from P.T. Anderson's other films. But, his character understanding is still flawless. All his usual themes are there, but are based around just two characters.A.O.Scott from The New York Times says it so well, ""What Mr. Anderson wants to do is recapture, without nostalgia, the giddiness and sweep of old movies, and his mastery of the emotional machinery of the medium is breathtaking."" When the movie begins, you have no idea where it's going. But slowly, it pulls you in and takes you on a weird fun ride. The loneliness and emptiness of the characters are so glaring, you can't resist from knowing what happens to them. The characters are real and relateable.Adam Sandler is out of his usual shoes; this might be the most sensible and complex character he has ever played. He carries it off quite terrifically. Emily Watson too was in a different territory, and she charms her way in and out. Seymour Hoffman, who's a regular in Anderson's movies, does a good job in his supporting role.All in all, not your usual romantic comedy!",Punch-Drunk Love
119,D_Burke,Adam Sandler's Best Film- Period!,10,1 February 2008,"You know, I really have always liked Adam Sandler's films. A lot of people, especially guys my age (in their early to mid 20's) like Sandler's old movies (i.e. ""Billy Madison"" (1995), ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996)), but hate all his new stuff including this movie. The reason many traditional Sandler fans hated this movie was because they thought it was a comedy, and they got something they didn't expect. Well, I came into it expecting a drama, and I thought Sandler did a bang-up job with this performance. This movie, in my mind, is unquestionably his finest performance to date.I write this review over five years after the release of this movie because a lot has happened in Sandler's career. This movie upon release received universally terrific reviews, but bombed at the box office. A lot of critics still said that Sandler should do more dramatic movies, and he has done two as of 2008. He did ""Spanglish"" (2004), which I thought was good but received mixed reviews, and ""Reign Over Me"" (2007), which I thought Sandler was a bit too over the top in. Unfortunately, many of the comedies he has released since this movie, most especially ""Click"" (2006) and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" (2007), have been his worst.Did this movie make Sandler's career ""jump the shark""? Not at all. I really thinks he does his best when he plays relatable characters in relatable situations, which he didn't in the latter comedies I mentioned. Whether it's comedy or drama, those kinds of characters and situations he appears to thrive in. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is no exception to that rule.Of course, Sandler was one of the major reasons this movie was so great. The direction by Paul Thomas Anderson was also a major contributing factor. I have not seen a bad P.T. Anderson film to date (including ""There Will Be Blood"", his most recent), and I have often seen his movies multiple times (including this one). Anderson is just such a gifted storyteller, and he creates characters that are equally intriguing. His characters all have a unique balance of humor and rage. Even if viewers can't relate to the characters on screen, they are sure as hell fun to watch.So ""Punch-Drunk Love"" receive great reviews, and then bombed. So what? So did ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), ""Almost Famous"" (2001), and other films that are now considered modern classics. As of the date of this writing, ""Meet The Spartans"" (2008) was #1 at the box office. I haven't seen that movie yet, and I already know from renting ""Date Movie"" (2006) that the film will suck and suck hard. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" gets ten stars in my book, and I'm sticking to my decision.",Punch-Drunk Love

That's when you'll recognize the genius of his performance and of the writing and directing.True film buffs will recognize Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin in all their pathos reborn in violent, heartbreaking yet still endearing reincarnation in Sandler.At once a love story and bitter commentary on the isolation of society and its treatment of the different and the lonely, like Borgnine's Marty of years ago.See it and have your heart broken and faith in love restored.

It's a very simple story, but it's filmed so wonderfully and the acting is so strong and realistic that it doesn't matter. I think Punch Drunk Love deserves some kind of award, it was a wonderful movie. It's funny, sad and yet so close to real life. I would give Punch Drunk Love 9/10",Punch-Drunk Love
122,bababear,An Earnest Try,3,21 June 2005,"This movie would have gotten a 1, but I like Adam Sandler and the backlit scene where he and Emily Watson embrace while dozens of people walk by was great. So I'll give it a couple of points.This movie looks to have been made without a script. It's live action and filmed in real locations, but it has no relationship to real life. Barry is a very unhappy character but his sisters (who don't get near as much screen time as they should have) are upset when he wants to seek professional help. This in spite of his having disrupted a family gathering with one of his violent outbursts.At the end of the story Lena is in love with Barry. Not to be a party pooper, but why? On their first date he gets them thrown out of a restaurant when he demolishes a bathroom to vent his anger. He gets her involved in a car wreck in which she could have been killed, then abandons her at the hospital. Does she feel sorry for him? Or is this a case where she's kissing the leading man because the script says she has to kiss the leading man because this is a romantic comedy and that's what people do in movies like this? Never mind that Barry's character is much closer to Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER than to any of Adam Sandler's other characterizations. She's gotta do what she's gotta do.I'd like to see Sandler work with Anderson again. His performance in this was excellent, and it hurts to think that he'll go back to his business as usual comedies. These two could do great work and I hope they get a chance to redeem themselves.",Punch-Drunk Love
123,theinaniloquent,"""Punch-Drunk Love""",9,29 April 2012,"I've never seen any of PSA's films. They sounded a bit interesting, on a level where you say you'll watch them later, get sidetracked, then end up doing something else. But I really did. I heard such good things about There Will Be Blood and Boogie Nights, but nothing really struck me to go out and watch them. I've never ever heard of Punch-Drunk Love until I saw it on Netflix. And you know that feeling that swims through you when you see a film with Adam Sandler? I actually thought I was getting into another one of his bad comedy films, albeit the intriguing title. But going on here, checking out the reviews, telling me kindly to ""know what your getting into"" I was sold. I sat down, relaxed, and turned on the film...11:50: The movie is still playing. I'm about 30 minutes into it, confused. I actually have no idea what to say. For one, Adam Sandler's character is so perfectly played. Yes, I said perfect. But outside of that, the movie was just so strange. I understood it was an art-house film but what exactly was it? I realized how late it was, shut down everything, and feel asleep wondering what the film was...The next day I got back online to see why I was so weirded out. Apparently the movie was a romantic-comedy. I saw nothing suggesting you were supposed to laugh at anything, because somehow to movie transfixes you into this awkward world where you don't whether to laugh or not. Learning that this film wasn't what I thought it was all cracked up to be, I watched it from the beginning again (and actually another time after that.) I loved it, and found the unusual atmosphere and antics all very real and well-acted. The problem is, is that people won't really understand the film; similar to how I was so weirded out I didn't complete it. Near the end of the film, I got used to the world of the movie and it all became quite normal I could say. I also found the soundtrack so mesmerizing and really interesting. It made me feel like I was Barry in the movie, where he is so fed up with everybody talking to him. He was a lonely, confused guy and you could understand him by watching it a few times. And strangely, the film is actually pretty funny as well. Not like laugh-at-loud funny, but the humor is blended with dark and dry humor. I laughed at the dialog exchange between Adam Sandler and Philip Seymour Hoffman.All in all, the movie takes time getting used to. As another user had stated, know what your getting into before seeing it. And if you start to watch it, getting too weirded out, and decide not to finish it, I advise you to watch the rest. I found it the most original, daring, interesting, and mesmerizing love stories ever. 9/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

125,Brogan,Another winner from P.T. Anderson!,10,13 November 2002,"(POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS) When I hear that a movie is under two hours, especially a movie directed by a talented director, I begin to feel disappointed.  To me, a short film means, not enough time to develop characters, plot, setting, etc.  My top ten favorite films of all time run at two hours or are longer.  But then there are those films, that are around ninety minutes that are brilliant with plot, character and setting. FARGO, RUSHMORE, and THE OX-BOW INCIDNET are all films that run under 100 minutes, yet they have more texture in that short time than most of Kevin Costner's films.  I was shocked to see and hear that the latest Paul Thomas Anderson film, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE was 94 minutes.  BOOGIE NIGHTS running time was 152 minutes, MAGNOLIA's running time was 188 minutes, I was beginning to accept Paul Thomas Anderson as a epic length director.  But with PUNCH DRUNK LOVE, Anderson manages to pull off another splendid delight with only 94 minutes of film. I've been saying for months that PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is going to do for Adam Sandler what THE TRUMAN SHOW did for Jim Carrey.  Adam Sandler will be accepted as a actor and not just for laughs.  As I said this to the countless teenagers and young adults who wanted to see PUNCH DRUNK LOVE, they didn't listen and expected to see HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON, or MR. DEEDS.  Now don't get me wrong,  I've always enjoyed Adam Sandler's work. I loved him on Saturday Night Live (from Opera Man to one of the ""Gap Girls""). I saw BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE on opening day and kept telling people that Sandler is indeed a very funny guy.  I even enjoyed the Sandler box office hits of THE WEDDING SINGER and BIG DADDY.  I forgave Sandler for doing the unfunny films of BULLETPROOF, THE WATERBOY and LITTLE NICKY. Then I began to cringe when I heard Sandler's name after watching the awful MR. DEEDS, was Sandler selling out?  Now I've regain my faith for Sandler, with thanks to Anderson for regaining my faith in Sandler's talent.  If there's any film that fits the typical personality of Sandler characters, PUNCH DRUNK LOVE is it. Sandler plays Barry Egan, a timid man who runs a business of making unbreakable toilet plungers.  Barry is the only male sibling with seven sisters.  Barry's sisters tease and ridiculed Barry all of his life, by calling him cruel names like ""Gay Boy.""  Barry doesn't deserve this treatment, he's just timid and shy.  But it's this teasing and taunting from the sisters that builds up the anger and aggression in Barry that at times, Barry can't take it anymore and just cracks.  Barry has two projects that he works on that occupy his time: buying as much Healthy Choice Pudding to collect frequent flyer miles to fly free for a life-time.  And, most important, his new romance with Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) a very nice and pretty girl who brings out the good side of Barry.  Yet, in Provo, Utah, a sleezy phone-sex owner, Dean Trumbell (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) sees Barry nothing more than a pervert who is cheating him out of hundreds of dollars. I've had people come up to me, yelling and screaming at me about how awful PUNCH DRUNK LOVE was, and that it was one of the worst films of the year!  Well, these are the same nimrods who love shallow movies like MR. DEEDS, THE WEDDING PLANNER, most of Sandra Bullock's films.  I saw PUNCH DRUNK with high expectations, and came out with a much bigger response. I LOVED THIS FILM!!!! I haven't seen a much more original and true to life romantic film like this in years!  The way the character of Barry is very agressive and angry, yet is changing it to being more calm, for his love of Lena.  There are some scenes where Sandler's performance is so well done, that I was both laughing and felt sorry for the guy at the same time. Kudos credit goes to Emily Watson playing the very nice and gentle Lena, and Anderson regulars Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the sleezy Dean Trumbell and Luis Guzman as the reliable Lance.  But if this film belongs to anybody it's both Sandler and Anderson. Sandler gives a very complex and detailed performance that it is worthy of a Oscar, not a nomination, but a statuette!  Just watching some of the scenes I looked closely at the face of Sandler, and he managed to give the character of Barry much complexity that not many other actors can give. I thought the character of Barry was MUCH better than Denzel Washington's Oscar winning role for TRAINNING DAY.  Then there's P.T. Anderson, who's directing with the long angles, the track shots, the multi-color images between scenes, and placing a perfect way to use Harry Nillson's underrated score from Robert Altman's POPEYE, by using the Shelly Duvall song, ""He Needs Me"" to fit into the story so well. Anderson won a Cannes Film Festival award for Best Director for this film, he deserved.  And if there was any justice, Anderson should get at least nominated for this film.  This is perhaps the best work I've seen Anderson do for a film, and it's less than half the running time of MAGNOLIA.  I loved PUNCH DRUNK LOVE very much that it's one of my favorite films of both this year and of all time.  And if you think what those negaitve ninnies said about it being the worst movie of all time.  Those same people said the same thing about EVITA, MEMENTO, and JAY & SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK, you be the judge.  As for me, I highly recommend this film, and I'm waiting to hear Sandler's acceptance speech (at least for the Golden Globes).  ***** (out of five)",Punch-Drunk Love
126,Ziya90,The man in blue suit,10,28 June 2013,"Personally, I am interested in offbeat, ""a fresh in the air"" romantic comedies. As known, Punch-Drunk is also an artistic romantic comedy that increases the value and the importance of the movie one level more. The opening scene was pointless, meaningless, but genius, in other words, meaninglessly genius. The film is a dark comedy, but it makes you laugh or smile more than many other typical comedies or romantic comedies. At least I did. There are really some weird details about the movie for me. For example, I haven't seen any other Adam Sandler movie yet in my life and also this movie made me like Adam Sandler, but it didn't change anything. I didn't see any other Adam Sandler film after watching this. May be, it was more like I loved Adam Sandler's character or as said I liked him just in this movie. Punch Drunk Love is a great, brilliant character study and I don't know Sandler's other performances, but it seems that, I don't know, his best performance and the deepest character are here! For example, he wears a blue suit, someone asks him like why did you get dressed like that? It is because he wants to feel himself good because of his boring job? or because he is in search of something ""lively"" or ""exciting""? The colorful animation transitions serve nothing, but the offbeat spirit of the movie which is good. The sisters, especially one sister of him is a nosy-parker, thus he (Sandler) is not happy with his life very much. The sisters in the film are a little different than the lovely and friendly mom in Stop or My Mom will Shoot! Thus, for example, he is interested in some unimportant things like flyer miles (reminding me Up in the Air, another great offbeat romantic comedy, but not a masterpiece like this) The call girl sequence is brilliant thanks to the script and of course Anderson ""The Master"" (but I didn't like that film unfortunately) It is as unforgettable as the call girl sequence in Paris Teksas. Watson beautifully plays and great as usual. Seymour Hoffman again steals the show when he appears as usual. Despite his character's connection to the movie is a little bit out of place, it adds a lot of things to the movie. By the way, just a little note, the phone scene near the end of the film made me cheered up and ""it gives me strength"" moment made me just stunned. In the end scene, I was like a cat on hot bricks! I want to thank Anderson for making such a film, such a clever film. I think it is a masterpiece and the best offbeat romantic comedy ever.",Punch-Drunk Love
127,ArizWldcat,Thankfully not the usual Adam Sandler movie,7,14 February 2003,"I would normally stay away from Adam Sandler movies.  I'd rather do laundry (and I hate doing laundry) than see ""Billy Madison"" or any of the other movies Mr. Sandler has done.  This was a rather dark story about Barry Egan, who has been dominated by his 7 (?) sisters  all of his life. They treat him badly and yet expect him to jump when they call.  Barry one night calls a 1-900 number because he is lonely.  They company ends up stealing his credit card and at first he doesn't know what to do.  He ends up standing up for himself, probably for the first time in his life.  Emily Watson does a wonderful job portraying Lena, the woman who inexplicably likes Barry, in spite of his quirkiness.If you enjoyed Sandler's previous movies, I can predict you probably will not like this one.  I found it refreshing to watch him in this role.",Punch-Drunk Love
128,BigJimNoFool,Awesome in every way,9,19 October 2020,"Leonard Cohen wrote that ""love is the engine of survival"" and it's something i have held onto for many years even before hearing the lines sung in The Future. To love and be loved is all Barry Egan wants and in Emily Watson's Lena he has found a loving woman. My heart is happy for them both.This is a remarkable film for the performance first and foremost of Adam Sandler which was quite a surprise back in 2002 that he had this in him. The soundtrack too moves from jolting, jarring, electronic vomit to the easy listening swoons of Hawaii as the camera glides effortlessly around our main protagonists and sets up some lovely shots. The light plays a big part hinting at something other worldly and dream like which reminded me of Eternal Sunshines' dream sequences.I have to say too this is laugh out loud funny there are some really subtle killer line deliveries mainly in the interactions with Sandler and Seymour Hofman but also just little moments like Barry saying that this really looks like Hawaii whilst in Hawaii. I love that subtle stuff much funnier than gross out stuff.And as always a pang of sadness ran through me once more at the loss of Phil Hofman he is terrific yet again in a small role here being suitably greasy and ""that's that, mattress man"" Brilliant",Punch-Drunk Love
129,faraaj-1,A classic - works wonders in every department,10,1 December 2006,"I sort of recall seeing Boogie Nights shortly after it came out. I didn't pay much attention to the movie because I was watching it with friends. I saw Magnolia when that came out and it struck me as being a very good movie, but I thought it an exaggeration to call P.T.Anderson a wunder-kid or the next Robert Altman. I delayed seeing Punch-Drunk Love for years because it was supposed to be the least best of Andersons films, probably because its done on a much smaller scale and its not an ensemble piece. I also confess that I don't generally visit the Adam Sandler section of video stores! However, I finally squeezed it in last night and I'm completely blown away.P.T. Anderson is the most exciting young director in years - even better than Tarantino or David Fincher. His attention to human detail is better than that of a seasoned veteran and that is perhaps why he can extract performances even from actors like Tom Cruise. Adam Sandler in this film is a revelation. There is a scene in Hawaii in the phone-booth where Sandler is talking to his sister and she is being, well, his sister. He gets desperate and then loses his cool. That scene was only a couple of seconds long but I think it will stay with me for years to come. He has the ability to create brilliant dialog in a cinematic language that is fresh, realistic and very original - something I admire about David Mamet as well. His use of music - original score as well as soundtrack is brilliant.BUT, where Anderson stands head and shoulders above other young directors is in his understanding of the mechanics of film-making. He has obviously studied the great works and directors of cinema history, and studied them well. But, instead of paying homage to them in an obvious manner, he has subtly incorporated their strengths into his own story. It is a joy to see the way the camera weaves around beautifully - such fluid photography and visually so elegant. There is not a lazy moment in Punch-Drunk, every frame executed to perfection. Most Anderson fans, and I know I'm a new addition to the club, like his large ensemble work and may have been disappointed by the smaller scale of Punch-Drunk. I would personally lean towards smaller stories like Punch-Drunk where he can build fuller characterizations as he has done with Barry Egan.This is one director to look out for and Punch-Drunk is truly a classic that merits more than one viewing.",Punch-Drunk Love
130,ozjeppe,Feels like a bad- taste cartoon joke gone sour.,2,31 July 2006,"This is simply pretty bad. Paul Thomas Anderson dares to go off-the-wall in a non-standard storytelling of an unusual love story in a contemporary Los Angeles. I'll give him that: Sandler is a social misfit- yes. His life is not exactly typically Hollywood schmaltz- OK. Misfits do find love- sure. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't like ""Maid in Manhattan""- crap more than most of you. But the script can't make me buy what Watson sees in him, and that major trouble ends up evoking ZERO empathy and hardly any sympathy for any of its characters on my part. Tongue-in-cheek black humor, (in the Coen Brothers fashion e.g.) would have worked, but here it just gets nasty and repellent. And add to it, a jarring music score and cold visuals that alienate me even more. Stars are good, though, in what looks and feels like a bad-taste cartoon joke gone even more sour. 2 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",Punch-Drunk Love
131,yossarian100,"Very funny, very odd, and very non-Hollywood!!",10,28 July 2003,"Fantastic!!! The oddest movie about the oddest person doing the oddest things for the oddest reasons I've ever seen. Adam Sandler loses the limiting formula that has constrained his performances and knocks off this movie with the finesse of Peter Sellers at his best. And, Emily Watson plays off Sandler with equal precision. I still can't believe this is a Hollywood movie and it didn't all end up on the cutting room floor. Punch-Drunk Love is amazingly funny but you have to survive the first thirty minutes of the movie because the pacing and structure are such that you might go insane watching it. Take a Valium if you need to but don't miss this odd and original film. My highest recommendation!!!!",Punch-Drunk Love

This picture is the absolute proof that critics can get on the bandwagon and make or break a movie.  We are Adam Sandler fans to the nth degree, we love everything he has ever done, movies, tv, cd's, concerts, you name it. Emily Watson is Academy Award caliber actress and the director is among the elite. However this movie made zero sense. It is a disgrace that they even made this movie. No plot, not a single redeeming value, just awful, we never ever leave a movie before its over no matter how bad. But we were oooh so close to leaving.  Adam Sandler was and is great, Emily Watson even better. But whoever wrote this movie and produced and directed it and those critics who gave so many stars and awards are just getting together to fool the public. I would be ashamed as a critic to say two thumbs up, great movie, winner of festival awards here and there. There was nothing absolutely nothing about this movie that made it worthwhile to even make.

133,Tiger_Mark,Another great offering from Anderson,10,19 October 2002,"P.T. Anderson once again displays the talent that has so many thinking that he is the best in the business right now. However, make no mistake, this is quite a different offering from Anderson's last two films. Considerably more light and without the large ensemble cast of ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia."" In fact, Sandler is in every single scene, quite a departure from Nights, Hard Eight and Magnolia. No mention of Jimmy Gator or Floyd Gondoli, what gives? Anderson chose to go simple and who can blame him after such a complicated offering in ""Magnolia."" However, don't confuse simple with simplistic, it is far from that.Adam Sandler is wonderful as Barry Egan, a small business owner in the San Fernando Valley. Egan is the brother of seven sisters and their overbearing personalities have done a number on Sandler's emotional development. A very insecure and borderline lunatic, Sandler has about as much self confidence as a leper in social situations. However, in his heart, he truly desires to be loved and love. A theme seen in all of Anderson's films. There are a few hurdles thrown at Sandler and Watson in this film, but they do overcome and the audience is left with a touching ending. Sandler fans might be a little confused by this movie, it is not ""Little Nicky."" What it is, is the first truly great offering of 2002.",Punch-Drunk Love
134,MF210,I found impossible not to surrender to the films charm,9,24 August 2004,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Minor SpoilersIf every romantic comedy made today was like Punch Drunk Love and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless, I would like the genre a hell of a lot more. Most of the time we get crap like Maid in Manhattan or My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Eternal Sunshine and Punch Drunk are romantic comedies full of imagination, style, and great performances. Those two films make routine romantic comedies look like the crap they really are. Punch Drunk Love can appropriate be called an ""unconventional romantic comedy."" This may come as a disappointment to those expecting a conventional, since the word ""conventional"" and Punch-Drunk Love are exact opposites. This film is different in how everything plays out and from a stylistic standpoint. It should come as no shock that Punch-Drunk Love is so different since the writer/director is Paul Thomas Anderson (director of Boogie Nights and Magnolia). Anderson's films have never appealed to everybody because he does so many offbeat things in his films (people who have seen Magnolia know exactly what I'm talking about). Some people think the things he does are clever, some think they are annoying and pretentious. I fall in the former group so it should come as no surprise that I loved the film.Punch-Drunk Love is actually a different Anderson film than Boogie Nights and Magnolia (I have yet to see Hard Eight). Both of those films were lengthy, ensemble pieces. Punch-Drunk Love is an 87 minute long(not counting the closing credits)romantic comedy. It's not as substantial as those films and it's obviously on a much smaller scale. Nevertheless, even though Punch-Drunk Love isn't as deep as those films it is handled with just as much care. The film, like Boogie Nights and Magnolia, is never rushed and Anderson makes sure that we recognize this is his film. Also like Boogie Nights and Magnolia, he uses long, unbroken takes throughout the film. Stylistically, Punch-Drunk Love is a beautiful film. Anderson and Cinematographer Robert Elswit create such a colorful atmosphere. I have always thought Anderson had a great visual sense and Punch-Drunk Love certainly proves that. A lot of credit should also be given to the production and costume designer. Jon Brion's score is perfect for the film.Perhaps Anderson's biggest risk is casting Adam Sandler in the lead role. Sandler has come into new territory with Punch-Drunk Love. The role isn't so much different from his usual characters except that I found this character more accessible. The character here was much more toned down and I was able to identify with him so much more (in fact, I think I am Barry Egan).So how does Sandler do in the role? To put it simply: He's great in it. He perfectly conveys the feelings of a shy, insecure man. Sandler shows us something we never thought we would see from him: a quiet, serious and just brilliant performance (how he did not get an Oscar Nomination was beyond me).  From an acting standpoint, this is definitely Sandlers film but the rest of the cast is wonderful. Emily Watson is radiant in her role and her chemistry with Sandler may not quite burn up the screen, but it is definitely there. Luis Guzman is delightful in his small role. However, the real scene-stealer from the supporting cast is Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Checkout his quite funny shouting match with him and Sandler). Punch-Drunk Love may not be as accomplished as Anderson's Boogie Nights and especially Magnolia, but it is unquestionably a great film and one of the best entries in the romantic comedy genre. It proves that enough imagination can be put in even the most bland genre. Anderson has created another winner, lets hope he comes out with a new film sometime in the near future.",Punch-Drunk Love
135,arthurclay,The worst Sandler's ever done,2,14 June 2005,"Much worse than ""Spanglish"" and that is humanly possible.

I have heard people on this website call this movie bad and that movie bad and sometimes they were right but if anybody called this movie ""good"" they are have never seen a good movie or they are crazier than a Polish wedding. The only repeat only good thing about this movie was seeing Phillip Seymour Hoffman attempt to play a bad guy I found that funny and that is certainly not enough to warrant a view. I kept thinking to myself what is going on here? Why is there no point? Why am I watching this it has to get better! But it does not.",Punch-Drunk Love
136,somf,An Explanation of an odd but brilliant film.,8,10 November 2002,"PT Anderson has now completed what film historians will someday probably refer to as his San Fernando Valley trilogy. At least I like to look at his last three films in this manner. And this is by far my favorite of the three. I felt that Boogie Nights was overrated, and that Magnolia really bogged down in the final hour; although I felt that they were both fine films. Punch Drunk Love has a few flaws, but is truly fascinating. What makes this such an interesting film is the use of symbolism that ties together the central theme in the script, the cinematography, the sound and the acting. What is the central theme you might ask? Well, if you have not seen the film a few spoilers follow: DISCORD AND HARMONY- This is the jumping off point of the film. The film opens with Adam Sandler's character Barry Egan alone in his company warehouse. Although he has his own large office space, he chooses to spend the time before his employees arrive at a small desk in a remote corner of the warehouse. We see the world through his eyes, a noisy frightening place. The first car wreck explodes across the scene with a frightening visual and jump out of your seat sound. Renters of the DVD will be clamoring for the volumes on their remotes at that instant. Immediately a ""piano"" is dropped off on the street in front of his warehouse. But what is first referred to as a piano is discovered to be a broken harmonium. Barry places it in his office and begins to tinker with the instrument. Barry hides from life in every conceivable manner. He cannot handle the cacophony that surrounds him. His life is loveless and lonely and he knows only two extremes to cope with his experience. Withdraw or totally lash out. On the day that the movie begins Barry is supposed to attend a party thrown by one of his 7 sisters. He has come to work in a new blue suit. The best adjective to describe the suit which he continues to wear for the entire week or so that the movie encompasses is ""loud"". Barry equates being able to venture into the noisy world with wearing a loud suit. I could almost write a dissertation on this film, which is a lot more than can be said about ""Little Nicky"". Think about what goes on when he first really meets Emily Watson. The unbearable noise and chaos that is surrounding him as the forklift is destroying his inventory. As he searches for love and the ability to communicate he just creates more chaos. He calls a phone sex line for what is obviously the first time, in a feeble attempt to initiate communication with the opposite sex. Each and every scene touches upon the concept of Discord and Harmony. Even many of the shots are filmed with light noise surrounding the images. When Emily Watson stands in front of her VW in the early morning first meeting with Barry the audience is almost blinded by the sun's rays. Anderson could have used a filter to eliminate that ""noise"" but he chose not to. There is so much more to write about this film. Go see it and think about the ""Discord and Harmony"" context. You will be sure to enjoy it. In the end he achieves true love and the harmonium is repaired. Heck, I didn't even get to the pudding.",Punch-Drunk Love
137,philthegreatone-786-63058,Interesting film with a change for Sandler,9,25 August 2011,"This may truly be one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. It starts with Adam Sandler playing Barry Egan who runs a warehouse company. He falls for a woman played By Emily Watson. At one stage he calls a sex hotline and chats up a girl on it. She calls him back demanding he help her with her finances. Then he gets in trouble with some other people including his 7 sisters. This is an interesting and surprising performance from Adam Sandler who usually plays the goofy idiots like in Billy Madison, Little Nicky e.t.c. He genuinely deserved that Golden Globe nod he got for this film. Anyone who is a fan of Sandler's should see this film",Punch-Drunk Love

It would be polite to describe the photography as amateurish; but I find that I am not that polite.The soundtrack is grating, annoying and does nothing to help this poorly conceived piece of tripe have any kind of redeeming value.
The characters are beyond redemption and are unforgivable in their loathsomeness. Even the `story' -- such as it is -- is absolute rubbish.

139,Ronin47,P.T. Anderson does it again! (***1/2),9,2 December 2002,"At this point, I don't know if it's possible for Paul Thomas Anderson to make a bad movie. After making one of my all-time favorites (""Boogie Nights""), two other great ones (""Magnolia"" and ""Hard Eight"") and now ""Punch-Drunk Love"", which is one of the very best of this year, it seems impossible to imagine him ever making anything that isn't in some way stunning.Covering a few pivotal days in the life of a twitchy, nervous and very lonely guy named Barry Egan (Adam Sandler in a truly award-worthy performance), ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is possibly the most original, intense romantic comedy I've ever seen. Like all of Anderson's previous films, it coasts on a wave of total unpredictability and energy; we honestly have no idea what's going to happen next.Reminding me strongly of Martin Scorcese's similarly surreal and hilarious comedy ""After Hours"", we basically watch a decent, sympathetic man become quickly engulfed by problems too big for him to solve and see him try to scramble desperately for a light at the end of the tunnel. For Barry, that light is Lena (Emily Watson, excellent as always), a woman who he has just met and likes him very much and most importantly, doesn't judge him.It is this, probably the first real love he's ever felt for anyone, that gives Barry the strength to stand up to all the people who are trying to step on him (among them the always great Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the manager of a phone-sex hotline. It's a long story).Clocking in at an extremely short (for a P.T. Anderson film) 90 minutes, the movie has no fat whatsoever. Those 90 fast-paced, furious minutes take you on quite a journey.One of the best of the year.",Punch-Drunk Love
140,jdollak,incredibly tense,9,3 November 2002,"After looking over the comments on this, people seem to be very split, and oddly, I agree with both sides.  I understand how this movie can be seen as being truly disgusting and difficult to relate to. But I found it to be far too relatable. Barry means to be doing the right thing, but he's been picked on, in such a horrible way by his sisters that it's no longer a possibility.  Even when he does what they want, he's a black sheep of the family. I don't identify with this.  But I do identify with having to juggle everyone else's wants without offending anyone. He's trying to get people to help him, but no one is willing to take him seriously. And that's why this relationship is working for him - she isn't evaluating him on these things.  Part of the reason why most people's relationships work out is because their partner is willing to accept their flaws. The movie is not really a comedy.  It's most accurately a character study. If you like things like Taxi Driver, this is comparable. Only the movie builds such incredible tension during the first half of it, that I was going to leave the theater.  My girlfriend was near crying through most of it. You feel sorry for Barry, since he can't cope with the problems he's had to deal with for so long, and finally once he has a love interest, he finds that he has enough strength in himself to counter the things that have made his life so hellish. I know I'll need to see it a few more times, but I really don't advise anyone to watch this as a 'couple movie'",Punch-Drunk Love
141,arthera09,fun interesting movie,8,29 December 2007,"The bought this movie used for like 5 dollars and I think it was worth it. I think this is Adam Sandler's best performance. I loved Emily Watson and the movie was just all around well done. I think some of the direction was a little weird. Maybe I just do not get the weird colors, but I don't think they were necessary or some of the tracking shots were not really necessary as much as love them. I think I recently read a description of the movie saying the reason they liked this movie is because it showed how a person similar Adam Sandler's typical characters would act in real life and I think this hits it pretty well. one of my favorite scenes is when they are in bed together and they are saying violent things to each other and it just shows how crazy both of them are. I think Emily Watson's character was extremely well done and how she is just as crazy as Sandler's character, but she is able to hide it a bit better because the movie was not about her. Another one my favorite scenes is when she runs up to him in Hawaii in her white dress. She looked stunning and it was a perfect movie moment exactly when Adam Sandler's character need a picture perfect moment. My main criticism would be with the lighting. In certain scenes the lighting was really good and I thought wow that is some good lighting, but sometimes it was just over the top and just too bright and too dark and just strangely colored. I really loved both characters and I think I decided I was really happy with Adam Sandler's performance when he is running in the airport when he arrives in Hawaii. At that point he stopped being Adam Sandler and just turned into Barry. Very funny movie and different which I loved to see.",Punch-Drunk Love
142,jay4stein79-1,Utterly Befuddling,9,4 February 2006,"Punch Drunk Love is a movie which I find difficult to describe; it is not a traditional comedy, though it is quite droll. That PT Anderson prepared for his jaunt into humor by writing for Saturday Night Live and that he wound up with Punk Drunk Love seems impossible. Not a moment in this film seems similar to the sketch comedy show. In my mind, it owes much more to something dry and absurd, like the State or Monty Python, though without those shows knowing winks at the audience. What Anderson has made with Punch is, simply, his most bizarre concoction to date. The frogs in Magnolia, perhaps, prepared us for the strange tale of Barry and Lena, but only slightly. Punch operates in a world of color, light, and composition that fails to hold a mirror to our own lives and times. Punch Drunk Love occupies some alternate reality. I think that this situation undoubtedly drove viewers nuts and infuriated many of Anderson's most vocal supporters. They probably believe he had finally become what his detractors had said from the beginning: inexcusably indulgent. I disagree, entirely. Punch Drunk Love is a singular vision of romantic comedy and a nice unraveling of the Adam Sandler ""character."" I don't necessarily agree with people who say Sandler shows his abilities here anymore than I think he does in the Water Boy. Yes, his antics are handled in a completely different manner here, but he does play a similar character to all those he's played before: a man-child. Punch Drunk offers more subtle treatment, but I think that owes more to the director and screenwriter than the actor (sorry, Adam!). In any event, I find the film an artistic and comedic achievement. It may not be Anderson's best, but it's admirable, watchable, and funny.",Punch-Drunk Love

If one expects a comedy because of the actor's reputation from his television work, then one will be amazed at the performance.  His versatility is truly remarkable.  One can appreciate his very profound acting skills in his portrayal of a young man with ""episodic dyscontrol syndrome"".  This is a form of epilepsy which is seeded in the temporal lobe of the brain.  It exhibits itself as an episode of extreme rage in which the patient takes great physical exertion toward inanimate objecgts.  It can be very freightening to those in his proximity. However, this cinema portrays a lighter side to this tragic disease. Sandler's character falls in love, and that love bond provides him with a healing quality that even Dilantin cannot supercede.  I can highly recommend this movie, and keep in mind that it is a serious film.",Punch-Drunk Love
145,Bravesfan17,An acquired taste that takes time,7,21 May 2010,"I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler movies. But I made the mistake of expecting another Adam Sandler comedy, so I was a bit disappointed the first time I saw this movie. I was expecting to see him do stupid things and at least have a love interest, both of those exist in this movie.Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a man who seems calm on the outside but is full of emotion. Adam Sandler plays this role really well with being able to channel Barry's emotions that well. He does do stupid things that cause him trouble, but instead of it being funny, there are more serious consequences. Sandler's performance is more in the realm of Spanglish and Reign Over Me being a serious performances.Like most of Adam Sandler's movies, there is a love interest. Her name is Lena Leonard, and she is played beautifully by the sweet Emily Watson. Watson shows us why she is interested in Barry and shows that she doesn't care about what his sisters say and what Barry does.Another couple of supporting characters involved are Lance, played by Luis Guzman, and Dean Trumbell, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Both do fine jobs, but aren't given much to work with.Behind all these performances is writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson. Anderson shows that he can get a great performance out of Sandler and not Sandler be himself. Anderson also makes interesting uses out of color schemes, especially with Sandler wearing blue and Watson wearing reds, whites, and pinks. Anderson's writing is even better as he makes transitions from scene to scene.If you don't like this movie the first time, wait a few months and try it again. For me, this movie is much better the second time around, and even more better the third time around.",Punch-Drunk Love

His character is clearly one whom the audience is meant to observe rather than empathize with.

Of course artists should experiment, but this is an indulgence; a number of random ideas thrown together to make a movie. The result could be the effort of a gifted film student with ADD.The use of Adam Sandler in the lead feels gimmicky; insurance so that the financiers don't lose their dough. Not that he's the problem - he's actually quite good. The problem is that Anderson has put Todd Solondz and David Lynch on his mixing decks, but where Solondz and Lynch are bona-fide strange, Anderson's quirky set-ups and humour come over as being simply contrived.And I do wish he'd kick the habit of overlaying scenes with an annoying and intrusive soundtrack.

152,enochsneed,A total knockout,9,18 March 2011,"I saw this film for the first time last night and it gripped me from first to last. I knew Adam Sandler's usual low-brow comedy, and I had heard of the title but I was not expecting anything like what I saw.From the start I was wanting to know more about Sandler's character. Who was this guy? Was he mentally ill, on the verge of a breakdown, or autistic in some way? How was he going to deal with a bunch of slimy blackmailers? He might look an awkward, downtrodden schmuck, but he has a hell of a temper, he is potentially very dangerous - there was real suspense here.Adam Sandler's performance was as fine a price of film acting as I have ever seen and why he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar I don't know (I am pleased to see he was nominated for a Golden Globe and won Best Actor at Gijón). He conveys impotent rage, social ineptitude and a sort of off-beat determination (for example, racing through miles of corridors in an impersonal apartment block to find the one person he knows can rescue him from a life of frustrated loneliness). The soundtrack (through heavy percussion which almost drowns out the dialogue) also conveys the mental tension of a man trying to keep a grip on himself and his world.This is not always a pleasant film to watch (either because of the threat of violence or the embarrassment you feel on Barry Egan's behalf) but it is certainly one that stays with you.",Punch-Drunk Love
153,FeverDog,Adam Sandler in a P.T. Anderson film? Surprise!,8,8 October 2002,"PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE is to BOOGIE NIGHTS as JACKIE BROWN is to PULP FICTION. (Meaning, a more subdued take on familiar themes and characters by a '90s wunderkid.)  P.T. Anderson's style is evident throughout PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, but this one doesn't have the coked-up urgency of his previous two movies. He's used titles (or, rather, the lack of opening credits including the title), colors and (especially) sound beautifully to convey his characters' quirkiness and unique personalities, and although the result doesn't approach the orgiastic highs of BOOGIE NIGHTS or MAGNOLIA, it's a sign of maturation - he is not just a two-hit wonder.Adam Sandler is, despite his character's problems, a completely lovable protagonist.  Yes, he pulled it off.  Aided by the always wonderful Emily Watson, Sandler's Barry Egan is a believable emotional wreck with a nasty but understandable streak of rage flowing through him.  Not everything that happens to him throughout the movie is, in retrospect, entirely plausible, but the performances carry the viewer to the end.  (Those who pondered the ending of MAGNOLIA but came to no explicable conclusion are warned that there are moments in this movie that are similarly open to interpretation.)PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, however, felt a little underdeveloped.  Maybe this is due to its abbreviated 95-minute running time, but I would have like some of the subplots expanded (such as the business with the seven sisters).  Perhaps Anderson thought the average Adam Sandler fan wouldn't sit still for 2+ hours?But, in short, PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE is a welcome change for Sandler.  I, like Roger Ebert, have always liked the man, and have been waiting years to see him in a good movie. The wait is over.8/10",Punch-Drunk Love
154,jaredpahl,"Punch-Drunk Love Is Quirky, Off-Beat, and Exceptionally Crafted; An Intoxicating Love Story",9,30 December 2016,"Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson is responsible for some of the most interesting human dramas of the past 15 years. Boogie Nights, Magnolia, and There Will Be Blood are fascinating character studies, focusing on greed, corruption, parenthood, loss, and suppressed emotions among other things. In Punch-Drunk Love Anderson tackles love. The result is PT Anderson's most complete and most satisfying work yet. Adam Sandler stars as a Barry Egan, a middling salesman and business owner who lives a mundane, solitary life. The film begins with Egan cooking up a scheme of sorts to capitalize on a frequent-flyer sweepstakes' marketing oversight. This scheme becomes an important focal point of the film after he is introduced to a friend of one of his seven sisters, Lena Leonard (Emily Watson). Lena clearly likes him, but Barry's self consciousness and inner sadness keep him from embracing her. There is also a subplot involving a sex-line and money extortion, which may seem out of place in similar love stories, but in the heightened reality, magic-realism world that PT Anderson has created, they are as essential as the rest of the story. I won't spoil how the pieces come together, but I will say that unlike Boogie Nights and Magnolia, movies which promised to tie together multiple plot lines and failed, Punch-Drunk Love weaves the seemingly disconnected stories together to paint a comprehensive picture of a man.And what a man he is. Barry Egan is a complete, unique and constantly fascinating character. He is written well, yes, but Adam Sandler's portrayal is a revelation. Sandler's expressions, body language, mannerisms, and voice are completely in tune with the tone of the movie, for one. There is something slightly off-center with him. He displays a certain type of quirky humor, but there is a deep undercurrent of darkness underneath; insecurities that bubble up to the surface in sometimes explosive ways. This is all communicated through Sandler's acting. There is a scene where Barry is jumped by a gang of ""enforcers"" and the way Sandler flinches and cries ""Ow, ow, ow!"" before the guy actually hits him, combined with the way in which he runs away from the fight, it generates a deep empathy for his character in just a few seconds. Sandler's performance is entirely made up of moments like that. He spends most of the movie just restrained enough so that we believe in his few outbursts. You can't help for feel for this guy who has been tortured by his sisters, who feels lonely but can't seem to bring himself to create relationships, who's insecurities have almost emotionally crippled him.Sandler's performance is clearly the focal point of the movie. He creates the empathy for the character, which in turn gives us a rooting interest in the love story. Because of Barry's sincerity, his kindness, and his hidden sadness, you root for him to pull himself together and find the love that is sitting right in front of him. Watson's Lena is an admittedly less rounded character, at least in the way she is written. We don't know why she loves Barry other than the fact that she saw his picture and thought he was cute. However, Emily Watson's performance communicates much more than the script does. We can infer her infatuation with Barry by the way she reacts to his sweet gestures, by the look in her eyes when they are together. Both performances are great, but Watson's is the more subtly affecting.Punch-Drunk Love is simultaneously a superb character study and love story. The filmmaking is rich and exciting, and the performances, especially Adam Sandler's, are endlessly compelling. Paul Thomas Anderson is up to the tricky task of alternating between the strange, the funny, the sad, and the uplifting tones of the story. Punch- Drunk Love might be the most insightful love story I've ever seen. It's a stand-up-and-cheer type of romance that avoids all the usual clichés and flawlessly endears us to a character that we have never seen before. PT Anderson has made more challenging, audacious movies, but none have been as satisfying as this effort.91/100",Punch-Drunk Love

The move also included lots of off-beat P.T.

If the movie had been cleaned up and judiciously edited, it would have been much more compelling.

156,wandereramor,"Tales from the brief reign of the kinder, respectable Adam Sandler",8,3 February 2013,"Punch Drunk Love is a strange movie. It stars Adam Sandler and a version of the lowbrow comedy he's become known for, but it's hard to imagine the usual audience of Mr. Deeds or Happy Gilmore being interested in watching Sandler wander aimlessly through Hawaii and have awkward phone conversations. Similarly, the story of the film doesn't have anything outwardly strange in it, but proceeds at such an awkward pace that it seems like storytelling from another planet with some bizarre alien values of narrative behind it. Maybe this is a commentary on the banality that surrounds Sandler's character, and really all of us -- the world of Punch Drunk Love is one of meaningless jobs selling even more meaningless products, of the half-baked detritus of capitalism, where absurdity is the only refuge. Or maybe I just didn't get it.There are parts of Punch Drunk Love that are obviously enjoyable, like Philip Seymour Hoffman as the vicious and strange runner of a phone-sex ring. There are parts that aren't so enjoyable, like the dull romance plot line. There are parts that I'm still not sure about, like the general aesthetic of the film.

157,K-Slicer,What was this? Can anyone even try to explain it???,10,18 July 2003,"""Dromedy"" is the perfect word to describe or to not describe this film. A dromedy is my own acronym for dramatic romantic comedy but that doesn't seem correct to put ""Punch-Drunk Love"" in that box. It is just too weird, unhinged and offbeat to be inserted into that category.
I really liked this movie and here are my reasons (spoilers herein): (1) I am a die-hard Adam Sandler fan and I believe the Barry Egan is the best one Sandler has ever tackled. Sandler has shown that he is a malleable talent and that he is even open to career advice. (2) I am not a big fan of PT Anderson (I found ""Boogie Nights"" to be a rather rancid piece of celluloid) but he has a knack for filmmaking and he shows his talent off here very well. (3) This has to be the weirdest story I have ever seen on film and that is a compliment. I was reminded of ""The Cable Guy"" when I watched this film but I wasn't repulsed either. (4) Of all the women that Adam Sandler has had by his side, Naomi Watts is the least annoying and by far the most likeable. Since she wanted to understand Sandler's rather extraordinary character, she was easy to cheer for. (5) Whatever the meaning or non-meaning behind the opening scene, it woke me up and from then on, I was riveted to my seat. (6) The fight scene was the best I have seen on screen since ""They Live"". It didn't seem contrived at all. (7) I really liked the confrontation scene between Sandler and Philip Seymour Hoffman. I hadn't felt tension like that since I saw a man goes through an odious insulin reaction. (8) Even though Adam Sandler decided to go through a major metamorphisis, he still kept his rage intact. His rage is his best comedic aspect but it was channeled here in a much different way. While he pummeled a TV producer for laughs in ""Mr. Deeds"", he pummeled an innocent bathroom for head shakes and hands over eyes. It was nice change of scenery. (9) I have never watched a movie that had me wanting to see what would happen next with that much anticipation. It was too weird not to turn it off (much like ""Donnie Darko""). (10) I love the fact that ""Punch-Drunk Love"" wasn't excessively drawn out.  The pacing was exceptional and the length was perfect.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.Overall, this is my favorite Adam Sandler movie as that is saying something. I am a big fan of Sandler's non-jerk roles and I am a bigger fan of Sandler's outside-the-box roles and there has only been one of those. Adam Sandler dared to do something different and it paid off in terms of respect and credibility. If he hadn't branched out into other sorts of roles, he would typecast as ""the funny jerk loser"" forever much like Daniel Radcliffe is to Harry Potter. Given a hand by one of the strangest directors currently out there, he now has his chance to build on his newfound glory and I hope he succeeds greatly.Here ends my rant!",Punch-Drunk Love
158,Ziglet_mir,Punch-Drunk Love,9,26 December 2016,"This film marks my 5th venture into the mind and vision of Paul Thomas Anderson (at this point in time I have not seen Magnolia or Inherent Vice). I think this may be one of the most unique portrayals of love film may have. It's not necessarily realistic in the sense of who the characters are, but it is telling from what the characters do and how they react and handle life. From the start, we can clearly tell that Barry Egan has problems and at the same time we are confused and overwhelmed in the world that Barry is in. Just by the first 5 minutes we have plenty of questions regarding Barry and what exactly it is he does. I will even admit that I was caught off guard by the use of the sound editing which is brilliantly utilized to make us feel overwhelmed, scared, timid just like Barry; and to snap us out of delusion and bring us into 'reality.' Something that can easily be a difficult place for many of us, and something we don't always wish to face. I will also admit that after the first 20 minutes I began to question where exactly the film was going, and it wasn't until Egan's love interest, Lena Leonard (charmingly played by Emily Watson), comes into the picture and shows an odd interest in Barry.Now there's a lot that can be said about love, and I think that's what makes this film great because it already has everything going for it: sound editing, quirky score, solid acting, unique camera-work, you get what I'm saying? Love is crazy. Love is blind. Opposites attract. Love makes you do crazy things. You'll find love when you least expect it. And maybe call it lazy writing (which is NOT the case) but it is reason enough to explain why someone like Lena falls for someone like Barry. They're both so similar (both have psychopathic tendencies) or Lena is rebounding from her previous relationship and just finds Barry interesting enough or love just makes you do crazy things. Whichever reason you prefer, and that's what I really enjoy about this film. These reasons and their meanings resonate with me and the film says what it's trying to say well.Even with all the character set-up prior to a specific scene with a tire-iron, did the meaning not completely hit me (excuse the play on words) until then. Everything became much more clear in hindsight. We can understand Barry's motives and how he's changing as a person because he's found love. He's still awkward and flawed as hell, but love may be his saving grace. Maybe love is our salvation and maybe there is hope for us all to find it. I applaud PTA who has yet to let me down.

The film is so unconventional and made in such a whimsical like manner that I was rather frustrated by its tip-toeing. At times it would hook you in, a scene, a comment would make you take attentiveness but then just as quickly it would let go and leave you a bit perplex.The film follows Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), a businessman who is socially-inept and oddly-eccentric, and who has a big family of seven sisters. After Barry is caught up in a phone-scam he meets Lena (Emily Watson) his love interest and becomes more erratic and idiosyncratic.Barry is a forlorn individual, and to Anderson's and Sandler's credit they are immediately able to create this almost parental protective feeling from the viewer towards Barry. The early scenes have an almost child-like quality and we can understand to some degree the personal struggle that Barry is enduring. Adam Sandler is also able to convey that behind the external niceties and quirkiness there is a darkness, or anger brooding inside.Somehow, Lena falls for Barry, although this does have an unpredictability factor, one can just about surmise that she seeks strangeness and peculiarity away from her normalcy. The film goes-on and for me is rather to self-assured. The screenplay gets caught up in its own whimsical nature and loses structure and cohesiveness. A few times in the film bizarre colours overlapping one-another would appear on screen, for what reason? This was completely bewildering and off-putting.Punch-Drunk Love is different, and it is not that I do not like the unconventional but too much oddity tends to hamper my enjoyment. It is a mish-mash of light/dark comedy, which never really is able to define itself or present a sure-footing. It is a film to ponder and I am sure many will appreciate it for its openness but I just couldn't engage myself strongly in the story.",Punch-Drunk Love
160,ween-3,PUDDING IT ALL TOGETHER,7,3 July 2003,"Adam Sandler in an art-house movie...isn't that the sixth sign of the apocalypse? Well...for what it's worth...the erstwhile purveyor of Hannukah songs puts in a performance that had me wondering if this is the beginning of Adam's walk down Robin Williams' yellow brick road. Let's see if he continues along these lines or retreats to ""Happy Gilmore-Part 2""...From ""Punch-Drunk Love"", one might infer that given the proper direction, Sandler is capable of more than just the ""greasy kid stuff"". 
The movie is every bit as confusing and open to interpretation as Anderson's ""Magnolia""...and just as interesting and engaging. Nice use of light throughout the film. The sound track is often purposely louder than the dialogue possibly to indicate the increased sense of frustration of the main character. The plot line is severely wacky...but sit back and go with the flow. It works. I'm just hard-pressed to explain just how.",Punch-Drunk Love
161,SinjinSB,I was expecting a better story from Paul Thomas Anderson,7,22 October 2002,"Based on the critical acclaim it has received, I had high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, I was let down.  I guess it's supposed to be sort of a romantic comedy, but I didn't think it was funny at all and the romance was a little too unbelievable for me.  Emily Watson's character was the most normal character in the movie and I couldn't understand what she would see in Adam Sandler's character.  He was a little too strange for my taste, and that's saying a lot for him.  I guess I can take him as a funny weirdo, but not a serious one.  The whole part of the movie dealing with the phone sex service gone wrong seemed lame to me.  And though I liked the part about the Healthy Choice airline miles, it didn't really seem to go anywhere.  I was expecting a better story from Paul Thomas Anderson.  His last film, Magnolia, was one of my favorites from the 90s, but Punch-Drunk Love left me flat.** (out of 4)",Punch-Drunk Love

An excellent movie, it is at times a bit uneven yet delivers romance, humour, and suspense.An unusual, often downright weird tale, with excellent performances (particularly from the fantastic Watson) from all involved. The romance and comedy is deftly handled; and the thriller sequences where the phone-sex girl rings Sandler could have come from any competent chiller.Scenes are filmed in both frenetic and slow pace, and the movie maintains its own inherent uniqueness throughout.Highly recommended.",Punch-Drunk Love

165,JohnLeeT,A Stunning Surprise,10,10 April 2013,"Thanks to a fine director, script, and a power house performance by Emily Watson this is one Adam Sandler film that is of surprising worth. Instead of the usual Sandler trash, the film has meaning, depth, and strong characters. Of course, the presence of Emily Watson, in a performance that is uncanny, is overwhelming responsible for what the director was able to achieve. As usual, she elevated the performances of all the cast, stunningly even Sandler. She is nothing less than lovely in her part and gives her character a strength, a deep compassion, and incredible beauty that enhances the movie tremendously. No one who sees her in this film can help but fall in love with her. Her inner beauty is only exceeded by the natural loveliness she brings to the screen. The only real question is why someone like her would have anything to do with someone like Sandler. Fortunately, those scenes that might have turned the stomachs of those who respect Watson take place in the dark or from a distance. This is a smart choice by the director and possibly one that Emily Watson might have gently suggested. Besides being deeply troubled and possibly dangerous, he happens to be Adam Sandler. Yet Watson somehow makes this plausible even though the thought of her actually having physical contact with such a person is nauseating. It is a strange pairing indeed. Only a actor of such power and talent could make an audience believe it for a moment and Emily Watson is a treasure for this director. His creation benefited more than words can convey by the mere presence of Emily Watson. That she was successful in saving Sandler from turning the film into a disaster is a credit to her passion for her craft. She gives the movie her all because she is simply not capable of doing any less. As a result, what might have been a terrible creative choice by her becomes one of the great surprises in cinematic history. This is ample evidence of what Emily Watson can do, even when her co-star could have been abominable, and it surely is evidence of her courage and talent. Not many fans of Sandler will appreciate this film and most will be confused by it. Those who have followed Emily Watson's career will be delighted at their discomfort.",Punch-Drunk Love
166,MovieLuvaMatt,I really loved this movie!,10,29 June 2003,"2002 was a little bit of a weird year for cinema, since two celebrities who have never gotten much positive acclaim in the past suddenly star in movies that made the critics change their tunes.  Those two celebrities are Eminem and Adam Sandler.  Now, I've always enjoyed Sandler, even in his goofy comedies like ""The Waterboy"" and ""Happy Gilmore.""  But I didn't love this movie purely out of being an Adam Sandler fan (that didn't stop me from viewing ""Mr. Deeds"" as mediocre).  The movies I react to best are the ones I most connect with.  I was really able to connect with the character of Barry Egan.  Yes, I know, it's sort of a scary thought, but I'm sure every moviegoer connects with at least one unflattering fictional movie character.  They may not admit it, but they do. Just like Barry, I'm sort of a shy, soft-spoken individual, who also happens to be passive-aggressive.  I don't normally react in major outbursts, but every once in a while those repressed feelings get the best of me and I totally lose my cool.  I once applied to work as an usher at a movie theater and one day the manager asked me to come in for an interview at a certain time.  I found out the manager left and I had to talk to another manager, and I had to wait over an hour.  Finally, I screamed at the customer service managers and kicked the counter.  Luckily, I still got the job, but the key word is ""luckily.""  So you can now see why I connect with the character of Barry.   P.T. Anderson is a very unique filmmaker with a very unique vision.  There are certain quirky touches like Sandler's character wearing the same blue suit throughout the film, finding a mini-piano that just got dropped off a truck for no particular reason, carrying a phone that he ripped the cord from all the way to Utah and collecting Healthy Choice pudding cups to receive a multitude of frequent flyer miles.  The film is funny, and sometimes hilarious, yet it never seems to go for laughs.  The comedy simply comes from the natural awkwardness of the situations. 
It's easy to mock Sandler for the mere fact that he's taking on a more straight, serious role.  But I really have to give it up to him.  He is NOT playing the same characters he has played in his low-brow comedies, like some critics and audiences have jeered.  There are shadows of those characters in Barry Egan, but as a whole the character is very different. It's hard to for a comic actor to discipline himself to a point where he never tries to go for a laugh.  Well, Sandler achieves that discipline.  If he's funny, he's funny as his character and not Sandler.  And there are certain subtle nuances Sandler added to his performance, like the way he rarely looks others in the eye and trembles like a young Woody Allen. 
The rest of the cast, including P.T. Anderson regulars (I'm surprised Philip Baker Hall didn't have at least a cameo), is remarkable as well.  Emily Watson is effective as usual, and so are Luis Guzman and the wonderful Philip Seymour Hoffman.This is also a film that I deeply enjoy, yet I can't recommend it to everybody.  The character-driven film unfolds at a moderately slow pace. That isn't necessarily an insult.  I've seen a couple of foreign films where scenes just play out, and the director isn't worried about those in the audience with a low attention span, and as a result I felt more of a connection to the characters.  The phone sex sequence plays out for quite a while, but it's effective in the way that we really get a sense of Barry's innocence and vulnerability.  Rarely do I watch a film where I'm really able to feel what another character is feeling, and this is one of those rare cases.  I felt Barry's fear when his credit card number and phone number was stolen by fraudulent phone sex operators.  Phil Hoffman's character keeps on saying that it's the price he pays for being a pervert.  Barry's not a perverted guy, but a lonely soul who saw the ad for a phone sex service one day and simply wanted to try it out.  ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is another extremely original P.T. Anderson masterpiece that I'd recommend to those looking for a film that totally breaks away from the Hollywood mold.  Just a greatly engaging character study with brilliant performances.  And believe it or not, I do believe Adam Sandler is one of the best actors Anderson could've chosen for the part.  I almost never give out this score, but I think the film deserves a...My score:  10 (out of 10)",Punch-Drunk Love
167,Nick Zbu,Impressive,10,18 November 2006,"I'm not a fan of Adam Sandler as a producer. While a lot of his movies are pretty juvenile to the point where the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team would gag, he does have an unmistakable knack for capturing the male creature of the 21st Century and showing it warts and all to startling effect. While this ability is masked in his comedies to the point where one would have to dig into the celluloid to see it, in Punch-Drunk Love it's exposed there and shows Sandler is one hell of an actor who should be doing more of this.I went in blind on this and came out profoundly impressed. One of the best movies I've seen in a while and horribly insightful. To be blunt, if you're a twenty-to-thirtysomething white male in America today this is one of the most important films you need to see, right next to Fight Club. It's that good.And on top of that insight, the movie is also deliciously absurdist and comes off as being what 'Joe Versus the Volcano' should have been but slightly lacking in the consumerist/workplace side. It's also one of the few movies I've yet to see that portrays a masculine-based love story that does not rely wholly on an action genre or something stereotypically masculine and aggrandizing. In short, it's a damn good film, everybody was good in it, and Sandler really shows his chops in acting here. If only he did more of this instead of crap like 'Spanglish.'",Punch-Drunk Love
168,Soysoy,What went wrong?,7,19 September 2003,"This is the question I ask myself after having seen this paradoxical piece of work.On one hand, the direction is so astounding, with such inspiration, artistry and precision that I'm inclined to consider that Paul T. Anderson  is about to emerge as the most talented director of our times. His work is simply marvelous, and shows both extraordinary good taste and very rich cinematic vocabulary. No real invention here, I mean you'll see none if you're familiar with the works of the Coens, Tarentino, Kubrick, and Lynch (among others, but those are the first to come to my mind). But Anderson is no copycat: he's a genuine article, one of those who are able to build on their predecessors with intelligence without ever mimicking, and whose talent give the impression they create the vocabulary they use (in pop music, Peter Gabriel and David Bowie are good examples of this). And the way he uses music! Incredible.On the other hand, where ""Magnolia"" was packed with emotion and humanity, ""P.D. Love"" feels strangely distant, too stylized, almost disincarnate. Even Emily Watson, who usually just needs to show her face to have a rock weeping (lol), didn't have me feel here compassion or empathy..?! The love story feels strangely irrelevant, though it's the core of the story...! This movie feels like it's from someone who has a problem to express love feelings. Maybe it's the case, even if ""Magnolia"" showed that Anderson is quite able to express a wide variety of human feelings, with an impressive depth and a relieving absence of both complacence and cynicism.Well, I enjoyed the pure cinematic wonders of ""P.D. Love"" quite a lot. But I think that Anderson really needs to take a step back now, and take the time to think about what he really intends to bring to an audience. This may be crucial for his upcoming works, because great style is not enough to create great art. If it was, most DePalma movies would be masterpieces (before you get mad, let me mention I DO like most DePalma movies, but the closer they are to cinematic perfection - like in ""Snake eyes"", the further they get from actual contents value despite the rich, intricate subtext). Anderson has the potential to do so much good to the 7th art, because he's not only a stunningly brilliant director, he's a very interesting writer too. So I'm expecting more from him than this half-baked (in terms of substance, not style) movie.I cross my fingers and wait for the next opus from this guy.",Punch-Drunk Love
169,WrathChld,"""Yeah, no. I can't do that.""",7,13 August 2003,"I had wanted to see this movie for a while because I am an Adam Sandler fan. I knew this was not going to be his ""typical"" role and I was actually looking forward to it.  Adam usually gets ragged on because ""people"" feel he isn't a good actor.  Basically that comes from the types of movies he is known for, which I think are just fine.  After viewing ""Punch-Drunk Love"" I feel he has proven he can not only act, but also do a role in a genre he wasn't known for.This is a movie about lonely man who keeps to himself and tends to bottle up emotions, until he explodes.  He has seven sisters who could drive any person mental.  They are the types that nag and verbally abuse their brother.  I'm surprised Barry didn't kill himself growing up because these girls are brutal.  Within the movie you see Barry get involved with a lovely woman who makes him happy and get caught up in a World of Trouble.I would suggest this to anyone who likes offbeat movies. Don't use Sandler as a factor when figuring out if you will like it.  This is not what you would expect from him.  This is a strange, but enjoyable movie.  This is a must see.",Punch-Drunk Love
170,AlbertCinefilu,Discovering the dual nature of love and the compromise between it's two natures.,8,30 November 2020,"The film is certainly much more than the title of my review. It's a delicate love story towards others and towards oneself. Maybe it feels a bit anti-climactic, the ending may not be that intense as in Anderson's previous movies Magnolia and Boogie Nights, but the movie certainly keeps you immersed in the story. The cinematography is excellent, maybe one of Anderson's best up to this point in his career and the soundtrack doesn't disappoint, as always. Something new that I recognized is this comedic touch, I kind of expected it when I saw Adam Sandler but still, it made the journey more pleasant to watch.

The man himself isn't aware of what he wants from his life. The piano thing makes it worse. Today, after 2 years, when I watched the trailer, it seemed far more interesting. I'd rather recommend to watch a movie that picks up well and doesn't depress. I really went to a depressing stage after watching this Movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
172,evilmatt-3,Beautiful in every sense of the word,9,12 October 2002,"I generally don't like to say this to people when I'm talking about film, because it makes me sound pretentious.  But after reading all of the nasty reviews for PT Anderson's newest, I feel it is my duty to say this: if you don't like this movie, you are either being deliberately obtuse or you just didn't get it.Although the theme of romantic love is not new territory for Anderson, _Punch-Drunk Love_ is his first film that focuses exclusively on the subject.  The story of two social outcasts who happen to be perfect together is not a new story, but never has it been told with such emotion, ferocity, and (paradoxically) tenderness and vulnerability.  The story is cute, sublime, and frightening, managing to be the perfect love that so dream of and others deny exists.  The look of the film, with its obnoxious coloring á là Kubrick and Todd Solondz, is nothing short of stunning.  This film should particularly be noted by Solondz fans, as it plays out like _Welcome to the Dollhouse_ on laughing gas.  Truly wonderful to watch.Sandler is amazing.  In general, he really irritates me, but he's perfectly cast here and is very restrained.  I'm not sure whether his effectiveness is a result of his talent or Anderson's, but he'll definitely be worth watching from now on.  Hoffman and Watson are terrific as always.Many of you are right: it's certainly not _Boogie Nights_.  Sorry kids, no big flopping penises here.  Just a good, mature, adult film.  Stay away if you can't handle it.",Punch-Drunk Love
173,cleary-joshua,The very first Adam Sandler film I have ever loved...,9,31 January 2015,"Remember when you saw ""The Truman Show"", ""Lost in Translation"" or ""Dead Poets' Society"" for the first time. It was a bit of a shock wasn't it, seeing a great comedy actor (Jim Carrey, Bill Murray and Robin Williams respectively) take on a more serious role and gives one of his finest performances to date. It might not be possible for every comedy actor to achieve such great success in a more dramatic role, but strangely, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" argues that it is. It takes one of the world's most polarising and broad comedy actors and puts him out of his comfort zone, allowing him to portray great emotional depth and working off his slightly awkward, neurotic mannerisms. That actor is, strangely, Adam Sandler, and this movie is the very first one of his that I have ever loved.Sandler plays Barry Egan, the lonely manager of a business which sells novelty toilet plungers out of a warehouse. From the very opening shot of the film we get a sense of his isolation, as he sits behind the solitary desk in the adjacent warehouse, but then interesting things start to happen all in the same morning. He witnesses a car accident, finds an abandoned harmonium and meets a strange English girl, played by Emily Watson. As the film proceeds, Egan falls in love with the girl, and weird things continue to happen, culminating in him being hunted down by gang members trying to get money off him. Various scenes in the film are laugh-out-loud funny, especially Sandler's naive encounter on a phone-sex line. The villain of the film is Philip Seymour Hoffman, who bizarrely owns a sofa store and runs the phone-sex line, and his eventual meeting with Sandler is a surreal and hilarious exchange of swear words.The film takes full advantage of Sandler's idiosyncrasies and bizarre manner, while still making Egan a character that we want to succeed. It's also quite funny, helped by the brilliant chemistry of the characters and the odd nature of the situations that take place. Because of the strength of the characters, however, you constantly suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to be taken into their strange world. It's both directed and written by Paul Thomas Anderson, who brings his unique eye to the film and makes it truly his own. The montage in Hawaii to the song ""He Needs Me"" from ""Popeye"" (sung by Shelley Duvall of all people) is so strange, but so totally enjoyable.Something that was very obvious to me by the end is that this film is not going to be to everyone's tastes. I watched it with my family and by the end none of them could understand why I loved it so much. I found brilliant comedy and charming emotion in the film, but others will simply find it quite strange and not be able to see past that. My advice would be to challenge yourself – if you're a fan of PTA or films by Charlie Kaufmann or Spike Jonze, this should be right up your street. It's just so sweet, and allows you briefly to change that awful opinion of Adam Sandler that you've always had.",Punch-Drunk Love
174,ianwagnerwatches,How Does P.T. Anderson Keep Surprising Me?,7,21 September 2021,"I had Punch Drunk Love on my list for a while, and only recently got around to it. This film feels like a collaboration between Paul Thomas Anderson and Spike Jonze. It's very surreal, the way it uses symbolism and off-beat dialogue makes this movie feel like a pseudo-romantic vignette rather than a romance. The way characters interact with each other is almost surreal, but real enough to relate to audiences on a personal level. There are dialogues in this film that speak to the raw, inexplicable power of no-brakes love that will either appall you or have you saying ""Damn, I thought that was just me"". The characters, which I find comfortably archetypal yet contradictory in their quirks and irrationality, blossom as the story unfolds. Again, the cinematography has a distinct place in Anderson's portfolio; the overexposed lights and dark shadows are familiar but refreshing in that they are more or less the focus of the film's visual language. The soundtrack, as well, is... ah, it's just perfect-the arrangements are boldly unusual, and the tracks themselves are unsettling, suspenseful, and, at times, downright adorable. The performances, like any P. T. Anderson film, are stellar. Punch Drunk Love features one of the only two Adam Sandler roles that I not only love but will always consider a significant part of his legacy.I'm in the minority of audiences who Anderson can't do wrong by: Magnolia, The Master, There Will Be Blood, Boogie Nights. I love them all. That said, Punch Drunk Love isn't for everyone. If you're looking for a romantic comedy that doesn't deviate from what you love, this ain't for you. If you want something fresh, but accesible, this is exactly that.Among cinematic love stories, this movie stands out and stands above. I don't know what I was expecting from a romance by this particular director, but my vague expectations were emphatically throttled.",Punch-Drunk Love
175,crypticcrytic,Time for me to punch out,4,2 November 2002,"`It's not an Adam Sandler movie. It's a movie with Adam Sandler.' You may have heard this encouragement when you balked at going to see ""Punch-Drunk Love."" So if you're a Sandler fan, go see ""Jackass"" cause the director of ""Boogie Nights' and ""Magnolia"" is going for a hat trick, sans the simulated sex, seediness and raining frogs.  That's the good news.In Chicago, there's a jinx on any World Series contender called the ex-Cub Factor. Like other well-known correlations - such as the Super Bowl/ stock market - this one damns the team with the most ex-Cubs on board. The similarly formulated Sandler Factor can bring a whole film down with him. That's the bad news.Emily Watson might have saved this quirky comedy but she didn't. Philip Seymour Hoffman, a regular in Anderson films, understands his role and delivers but can't save it from a supporting position. Paul Thomas Anderson (the director) was moving towards the mastery of his craft but he took a break. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is not worth the effort to review, or your time to view. Adam Sandler has a long way to go to become a legitimate actor. But that's not going to stop him from getting rich.Life isn't fair.",Punch-Drunk Love
176,LuckyFour-LeafClover,"Different, but I liked it",8,27 December 2020,I grew up a fan of Sandler in the 90s but it kind of waned over time. I know he's gotten into more dramatic fare of late like Uncut Gems. But that movie I wasn't much a fan of as I didn't find the main character all that likable. This movie was different in that Barry's character was a decent/good person underneath all the personality quirks.Sandler plays Barry a quirky but likable business owner. He's overshadowed by several overbearing sisters who give him anxiety and it seems screw with his head. He also has anger and rage issues that I guess manifest because he can't express his frustration easily? Eventually one of his sisters has a friend that seems to like Barry and the movie takes off.Not a perfect film but a good one.,Punch-Drunk Love
177,Squrpleboy,Wonderfully Flawed,8,1 October 2002,"P.T. Anderson is the bravest filmmaker in Hollywood.  He writesand directs films that ask an audience not only to give up theirnotions of typical, commercial, ""genre"" cinema, but also force themto THINK while watching;  and most importantly, he asks you toFEEL.  Punch-Drunk Love is all about EMOTION(s).  And that iswhere the problem begins.....Punch-Drunk Love is an incredibly complex and rich study ofhuman emotions and dysfunction ------ being marketed as a""Romantic Comedy"".  There ARE laughs, but often awkward onesas we watch Adam Sandler, as Barry Egan, struggle through anattempt at Life, and a burgeoning Love, while he struggles tooverpower the obvious MENTAL ILLNESS that he is inflicted with. Barry is not just a two-dimensional ""weirdo"", but rather a man ingreat inner pain who is striving to make his life better, even whenhe's not sure how.  I don't believe general audiences will see that,if they even bother looking to begin with....For one, most people expect Adam Sandler to play a ""lovabledoofus"" (as one Toronto film-critic noted), and yes, Sandler asBarry Egan IS lovable, and slightly off, but his character is writtenso much deeper than that ------------ perhaps deeper than mostmovie-viewers will want, or even feel completely comfortable intrying to truly dig for.  And that is a shame, not only for the characteror the film's sake, but for Sandler's truly good performance as well.Gone are the ensemble casting, lush cinematography, exquisitesound track score and near perfection that have become thetrademark and expectancy of ""A  P.T. Anderson Picture"", andinstead we are left with a short, soulful, emotionally tense andlayered piece, not so perfect, but really worth watching ------------CAREFULLY!Emily Watson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mary Lynn Rajskubalso add wonderfully to the cast (although I have no idea why theotherwise great Luis Guzman was cast is such a non-engagingrole for this film).  Not Anderson's best film, but miles ahead ofmost cinema by far.My score:  8/10  There IS magic in ""Punch-Drunk Love"", as in Life, ifyou just look for it!",Punch-Drunk Love
178,Thunderbuck,VERY original,9,30 June 2003,"Not being a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (I found Boogie Nights kind of long and impenetrable and I haven't seen Magnolia yet), and only liking Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore, I didn't have very high hopes for this film.  In fact, the only reason I wound up seeing it at all is that my wife rented it; I'm not sure I would have.  I now find myself having to reevaluate both Anderson and Sandler, because this is one of the most brilliantly original movies I've seen in a long time.  It had to be the most innovative movie to come out of Hollywood last year, definitely.First off, this is an ""art film"".  If you're not a film geek, it's highly unlikely you're going to like this.  It's wierd, it's quirky, and doesn't always make sense.  Sandler wears the same neon blue suit in pretty much every (beautifully-composed) frame.  HOWEVER, Sandler plays a guy who lives his life in a constant state of assault.  His Barry Egan doesn't quite feel comfortable in his own skin, and we get this in abundance right from the first frame.I decided I liked this movie in an early scene where Egan arrives at work, and everything seems to be happening at once.  A sister arrives to introduce single Barry to a friend as a set-up, a blackmailing phone-sex operator is calling to harrass him, and all manner of trivial interruptions come fast and furious.  Barry is outwardly holding things more or less together, but there is a bizarre soundtrack to the scene that betrays his inner turmoil.I found this movie genuinely admirable, and I 'got' pretty much every creative decision Anderson (and Sandler) made.  I can't guarantee that everyone will 'get' it, but I'm glad I did.",Punch-Drunk Love
179,sethmlanders,Adam Sandler like you've never seen him before!,8,2 July 2015,"If you're expecting a gross-out goofy comedy, look somewhere else. This is one of the rare occasions where Adam Sandler has a serious role. I'm not the biggest fan of PT Anderson (I was disappointed by Boogie Nights) but I liked this movie.Adam Sandler plays a man named Barry Egan who works in a warehouse. He has problems with social skills, I suspect it's Aspergers or something. Anyway, he calls a phone sex hot-line and the people who run it end up extorting money from him after he gives out his credit card information. Constantly, he is irritated by his sisters who give him a hard time and ends up falling for a girl. Along the way, we see who this character really is and how his temper has a short fuse.It's fascinating to see this performance from Sandler, rather than the usual immature man-child that he plays so often. Quite weird of a movie but I ended up enjoying it!",Punch-Drunk Love
180,Laitue_Gonflable,Adam Sandler finally gets good material,8,10 April 2003,"Punch-drunk Love is unique and original, and a brilliant piece of cinema. However, as soon as the words 'brilliant piece of cinema' are out of my mouth you know that means it is not for everybody's tastes. It is arty, and disturbing, and has some deliberately unusual scenes which will no doubt drop this film in a lot of people's opinions. In fact, upon leaving the cinema, I overheard one of my fellow patrons describe this as 'the worst movie they had ever seen'.If indeed this is the worst movie you have ever seen, you obviously have not seen many movies. This is far from being a bad film. However, by this I do not mean it is a good film, merely that you shouldn't expect it to be a good film.Adam Sandler is one of the biggest movie stars out at the moment, not because he gets a lot of acclaim, brilliant reviews and acting awards, but because he appears in his own movies, with little or no other talent involved at all. And, up until now, he has left a lot to be desired as an actor. In ""Punch-drunk Love"", he finally gets the material that he needs to actually display his talent. Admittedly, the role of Barry Egan is exactly the same as we've seen him before, in Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Little Nicky, Big Daddy, the list goes on...But for once, the script and the direction compliments it in a way that can be considered 'good' rather than simply 'entertaining' for young teens. My answer to the question, is Adam Sandler a bad actor is now no. He is simply a good actor with a very limited range. He is perfectly cast in this film and accomplishes what is not an easy role with panache.Paul Thomas Anderson, behind the camera, has achieved and original masterpiece in my opinion. It is exquisitely shot and makes you feel uncomfortable while simultaneously leaves you wanting more. He has also managed to get fine performances out of Sandler, Watson and Hoffman alike. However, the major criticism comes from the script. One reason it is likely to disappoint is that, for a lot of the film, the dialogue seems to be, to coin a phrase, 'weird for the sake of weird'. It's the sort of script where the story could have been written by someone else, and then the bizarre yet incredibly creative genius of Paul Thomas Anderson turned it into something else, something completely different and wonderfully new. I personally loved the eccentricities in the dialogue. However, there are a number of unanswered questions raised in the script and I won't go into them here because a film is often going to leave you questioning, particularly an art-house film like this. But I personally felt that there were a large number of parts to this plot, but the film only dealt with one of them in depth, namely the romance between Sandler and Watson, and I felt that the rest of the film was a little convoluted in the background. Maybe it could have been extended just ten or twenty minutes longer to tie up a few more of the loose ends a bit tighter.This criticism, however, is petty, and it does not detract from the film as a whole. Overall, it is a superbly original, occasionally hilarious and wonderful film. Four and a half stars out of five.",Punch-Drunk Love
181,markymark70,Weird but not wonderful...,2,25 March 2009,"My wife brought home this DVD last night from the video store on the premise that ""Adam Sandler is in it so it must be funny"". Wow... was that a wrong statement or what? Now, I have to admit - I'm not the greatest fan of Sandler (He seems to play himself in every movie : yes including ""The Water Boy"" : and has a bland charisma on screen all the time) and because of this I was at least willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt to begin with. My wife did not - rubbishing the movie with the statement: ""The worst film I've ever seen"".However - let me approach this methodically and go through the pros and cons : Pros : 1. Sandler - Amazingly, he does a very good job of Barry Egan. His acting was top-drawer, the nervous twitches, the shy almost embarrassed body movements epitomised his character down to the ground. Well done. 2. Cinematography - the handling of the camera was impressive with some nice one-track shots (especially of Sandler in his apartment ringing the sex line) and good wide angle, slow-mo zoom shots.Cons : Everything else.. The storyline was simplistic, muddled, juvenile - and these are the kindest words I can give it. Pathetic would be more accurate. The opening sequences involves an empty warehouse, a pre-cognitive Sandler, A car crash, a taxi and a small piano. A start that piques the viewer's interest but one that is never explained. Emily Watson had an unplayable part. The music was included to generate the feeling of claustrophobia but instead gives the viewer ire trying to hear the conversation happening behind it.A word of advice for Sandler is that if he wants to branch out to other forms of acting then fine....but just pick your scripts carefully. As for Paul Thomas Anderson - well you either love him or you hate him.... let's put it this way : I don't love him.2/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

But this is a bit of a disappointment.Anderson's dialogue is always interesting but in this movie thequirky touches he's found so naturally in his previous workseemed laboured here. The Adam Sandler character is full of potential and the premise and central relationships are wonderfully unveiled but then the movie just potters along. Iwould've been happy to watch Sandler's relationship with his nuttysisters for two hours but the whole Emily Watson love story fallsflat. I felt that this was a retrograde step in Anderson'sdevelopment as a filmmaker. People have quite rightly praised Sandler for his performance(courtesy of some great writing) but the praise heaped on thismovie as a whole is just an example of the Emperor's NewClothes. Expect less - you'll enjoy more. Still, I'm now looking forward to his next movie - I reckon it's just ablip on an upward trajectory.",Punch-Drunk Love

184,rsmolin,Dynamite Idea Turns Flat as a Pancake,5,28 October 2002,"Contrary to all the glowing reviews everywhere about this very strange film, I must make a very simple statement--the movie ran out gas. Anderson can't make a romantic comedy without humor, and the third act of this film lacks humor, instead focusing on a boring trip to Hawaii that leaves the viewer saying, ""So what?"" This film starts off a-la David Lynch and builds remarkably well into a crescendo of events that bombard Sandler, and things are looking great for a movie audience startled by the filmmaker's medley of unusual events.
Sandler's character begins to shock us all, but the intrusion of a romantic character makes no sense whatsoever. The movie begins to flatten as soon as the romantic comedy takes over. We're willing to accept a bizarre assortment of ideas and characters, but the boring scenes of anti-hero with anti-heroine just don't click. We don't really laugh. And we sit there impatiently waiting for a return to the film's engaging beginning. Alas, nothing. A happy ending for a kooky Sandler but an unhappy one for the audience, which deserved so much more from the awesome potential in this film.",Punch-Drunk Love
185,Edu-16,intense and interesting,9,5 May 2004,"At times very uncomfortable and intense - but always intelligent, PunchDrunk Love was a very enjoyable watch.  I hadnt realised this was the same director as Magnolia....and if you liked that - you will like this one too. It got to me in a similar way to Memento - and I suspect that it will gain a similar long term following.I liked it because it was original - it didnt patronise and the performances were superb.  Sandler always seemed close to going 'postal'.  I wondered for a while how such intensity could be justified - but then we meet his sisters and all is explained!  ""Remember how we used to call you 'Gay boy'?""  A couple of decades of that would be enough to turn anyone a little jumpy.It has it's funny moments - but it's not a comedy.  It's more of a ballet than anything - with little colour in most of the scenes the attention is thrown more on the movement, and there's alot of it.Much could be read into the imagery, Im sure, but the film stands on it's own without needing to know exactly all the references.  (So unlike Mulholland Drive in this respect ~!).  Emily Watson was perfectly cast - being somewhat edgy and off beat herself...Intense, unusual and a major cut above the rest.  At least there's still one or two this good a year.....",Punch-Drunk Love

I was hoping for a light hearted movie , of two awkward people who found each other and fell in love. But sadly that wasn't the case at all! For there was nothing sweet or endearing about it . It was that awful one of the worst Sandler movies ever, you think recovering from a hangover is bad ! This was even worse than that, it was raunchy not to mention confusing !

If you like off the wall, noisy, frenetic, jerky, shallow (trying to look deep)movies... then you will enjoy this. If you are looking for Ghost World, and others of the Altman, Kubrik ilk, then you will get what you like.On the other hand, if you really liked Sandler in Mr.Deeds, Wedding Singer, Waterboy, et. al., then DO NOT expect to find the same thing in this one - other than the inevitable two dimensional Sandler put upon character and predictable ending.I found many of Sandler's movies funny and enjoyable. This one unfortunately was erratic, dark, violent and even vulgar. In segments of the film it seemed Sandler was trying to emulate Chris Rock or Eddie Murphy in seeing how many times you could cram the f-word and its variations into one sequence.I personally found this unfunny trifle a waste of time and money.",Punch-Drunk Love
188,LaurieMann,What Was He Thinking?,5,2 November 2002,"I've seen Magnolia (liked it quite a lot) and Boogie Nights (liked it much more than I expected to), so I thought Paul Thomas Anderson had one problem licked - understanding how to construct a script and how to direct an entire movie.Unfortunately, he lost his way big time with this movie.I really like quiet, understated pictures.  The scene early in the movie when Adam Sandler wanders out of the warehouse just to watch the sun rise was beautifully shot.  There are a few gorgeous shots in this movie, but a thoughtfully-composed shot can't compensate for a script that Anderson seemed to have phoned in to himself.Many incomprehensible things happen.  A bizzare car accident.  The harmonium just dumped at the end of Sandler's driveway.  In Magnolia, when it rained down frogs, that was an odd, jarring bit that was distracting, but the rest of the movie was so strong you could forgive Anderson a little self-indulgence.  But Punch-Drunk Love is just such a careless movie. Look at the completely illogical behavior of almost everyone in this movie. Look at the way it goes from late afternoon to mid-afternoon to evening to afternoon and then to morning in about a 12 hour sequence of time in Hawaii. I don't blame Sandler and Watson too much for this, because Anderson has such a track record that it was worth the risk for them.  Sandler's character was intriguing, and his timing (the ""yes/no"" bit especially) was spot-on.  But it's really hard to identify with him; and how can you want someone who seems somewhat normal (like Watson) to hook up with someone so far gone?",Punch-Drunk Love
189,Zingbot_9000,Movie that gets worse as time goes on.,3,15 September 2003,"This movie was like watching a movie on acid - at least I felt like I was on acid.
I started out kinda finding this movie somewhat entertaining.  Then as the movie went on lost total interest in it.  I thought to myself this is supposed to be a love story but there was NO CHEMISTRY between the two main characters at all.  The movie was so preoccupied with being weird that it forgot to develop the story.Another disappointing thing was the storyline Adam had with the phone sex girl.  The suspense built up as the movie went along but in the end the conclusion to this story angle was very very flat.  What was that???Overall the movie was just disappointing.As for the DVD don't let them kid you with the offering a two disk set. They couldn't fit all this on one disk???? The first disk is the movie only and the second disk is two deleted scenes and a bunch of garbage.  No behind the scenes stuff.  No interviews with the cast.  It was just clips of the movie spleeced together in even more bizarre ways than they were already shown in the movie already.  I think the dvd extras were even more disappointing than the movie itself and that is saying a lot.

191,spencer-w-hensley,Not as bad as some of these reviews say but definitely weird and unashamedly so,5,26 March 2021,"I really looked forward to this film as critics all agreed Sandler was great in this movie. All of the critics who panned his previous and later films agreed that he was great in this movie. However I was also a little concerned in discovering that this was also one of Sandler's few box office flops so I lowered expectations slightly. The movie itself is very mediocre. I didnt love it as much as critics did but I certainly didnt hate it like some of the other audience members who saw it either. Sandler is great, unfortunately it's the story which just gets way too weird that for me was where this film fell from being a masterpiece to just average. Also the pacing is somewhat slow. Some scenes have momentum to be sure but on the whole it seems like the director Paul Thomas Anderson wanted this to be purposely slow which can definitely have a frustrating toll on the audience. The story itself was also just one I couldn't personally relate to. Parts of it seemed very unrealistic. And the ending just was on a whole new level of weird that I had ever seen, stranger than any Stanley Kubrick or Tim Burton film I have ever seen, and we know how strange those guys could be behind the camera. I liked it better than the more recent Uncut Gems but its far from a great film. That's probably because I enjoyed Adam Sandler's previous dumb comedies. That's why I enjoy his movies I want to turn off my brain and laugh. Sure hes a good dramatic actor but that is not the main reason I want to see his movies. If you find Adam Sandler to be obnoxious or over the top in his comedies you might like him in this movie as he was aiming to be serious with this role. If you like his comedies though you will probably be bored and find the movie frustrating on the whole. A decent effort from Paul Thomas Anderson and Sandler is good but disappointing from the script that seems to go over the top into a bizarre mode that in the end just isnt very satisfying. If you want to see Adam Sandler in a serious film which is nowhere near as strange as this film check out Reign Over Me with he and Don Cheadle. He gives a great performance in it and it is a good story.",Punch-Drunk Love
192,DrPhibes1964,The strange joys of lo v e,10,29 May 2021,"I passed on seeing Punch Drunk Love when it was initially released and dismissed it as being just another Adam Sandler movie. I had no idea who Paul Thomas Anderson was and thought this going to be yet another variation of ""comedy"" that Sandler produced. When I caught it on a d d rental from a local video store I was proven dead wrong about this assumption. This is the best Adam Sandler film I have ever seen--- actually the only one I can sit through next to The Wedding Singer.I was immediately struck by the strange tone of the film,especially Sandler playing against type here as the shy and withdraw Barry. But when we meet his sadistic sisters we immediately understand why he is the way he is. In his other movies he plays a variation of the same character, namely the schizophrenic who is prone to violent outbursts that have no source and he assumes we will like and identify with this particular character. But as Barry Egan we see a very conflicted man. Into his world comes Emily Watson. He faces an important crossroads in his life and must decide whether to open up and finally trust someone. Even though it is not beaten over our heads we come to the conclusion that his sisters made his childhood a living hell and it drove him inward. I will not go any further into the story for fear of ruining it for a first-time viewer. It is totally different from Happy Madison, The Water Boy, or any other Adam Sandler movie, running the gamut of emotions, often uncomfortable and embarrassing, but all heading somewhere for this character. There is one moment when we see the turning point that made me shout aloud YES!!! When you see it I hope you have the same reaction. This is a wonderful and special film. Sadly, Sandler seems very partial to making movies that are lesser than Punch Drunk Love. Here he proves that he has talent.",Punch-Drunk Love

It's hard to describe the movie itself. It seems simple. A run-of-the-mill retailer who is the brother of 7 sisters (yeah, 7!) finds love after he discovers a harmonium in the street. (Or is it love?) Man, his sisters are something else. The characterizations were impeccable. I wanted to hit his sisters. (Maybe more than once.) Never have I felt so much compassion for a guy that can get violent. I felt bad for every little thing to which I ever subjected my little brother. (Hey, it was always self-defense. -- Well, mostly, anyway.) This movie takes turns you don't expect, but makes them in such a way that you realize it was inevitable. I highly recommend this movie. If you watch it once, you need to watch it again before you make up your mind about it. I was amazed at the depth of this movie. I was surprised by the cinematography.

To me this should be on IMDB's top 250,all it needs is a couple more votes. I haven't felt this way toward a film since DONNIE DARKO. Even tough a lot of people don't like this I can see what they mean. This film has a weirdness to that will make you turn it off, but this weirdness to me makes the film beauty. This is P.t.

197,mrrockey,Strange yet Heartwarming,9,13 August 2013,"Punch-Drunk Love is a very strange film. It has the plot of a basic romantic-comedy film but it's told in a very strange, unusual way. But does this make or break the film? Let's take a look and find out!Firstly, the story. While the story here is just a basic story about a guy who has some problems which in this case is anger management and social anxiety, who falls in love and that ultimately turns his life around, it's told in a very unusual manner. The film has a very uncomfortable mood to it. The first 30 minutes or so has very little music playing and there's a lot of shots that linger for a long time. The cinematography has a very white, cold look to it which makes the film feel very cold and depressing. But there's also a lot of black humor going on and while it's funny, it also makes you feel bad for our protagonist, Barry. I actually really like the black humor going on because it makes you both laugh and feel sympathy for our main character. This proves that you don't always need sad music and a lot of crying to make us sympathize with our protagonist. When the date comes around, there's some really sweet music playing and it contrasts well with earlier parts of the film because here, his life has meaning to it and it isn't as blank as it was before. SYMBOLISM!When he eventually runs to Hawaii to stay with Lena, the song He Needs Me from Popeye starts playing and it really makes the film feel a lot sweeter. To top it off, it punctuates in a romantic kiss in silhouette. It really works! I often don't like movies that have a cold, dead tone to it the entire time and this movie proves that you can have a warm, sweet tone to a cold film as well. When the happy ending does come along, it feels all the more happy because of how cold and depressing the film felt at first. So it's a definitely well directed movie but how's the performances? Adam Sandler is actually really good in this movie! He does the usual Sandler antics here but he also plays Barry's emotional problems really well. It's kinda sad this film didn't properly establish him as a serious dramatic actor because he's actually really good here. Emily Watson doesn't do a whole lot here but she's likable and she has good chemistry with Sandler. Philip Seymour Hoffman doesn't get a whole lot of screen time but he is pretty funny when he is on screen. Ultimately, this is Sandler's movie and he knocked it out of the park!So this movie has a strong emotional connection to the audience and is very well directed and acted but this film(like all films) has its flaws. There's some strange scenes early in this film that is probably written for symbolism but has no purpose beyond that. Also, I don't quite get the whole deal with him buying so much pudding but maybe I'll understand it better over repeated viewings.Overall, Punch-Drunk Love is a unique, heartwarming, funny, and stylish film so I'll give it a 8/10.",Punch-Drunk Love
198,tvspace,mind-numbing exercise,4,15 October 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson has proven with Boogie Nights and Magnolia that he's one of our most interesting working directors.  With Punch-Drunk Love he proves that being interesting isn't enough to make a good movie.This film chronicles a few climactic days in the life of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), a socially uncomfortable misfit who is trapped deep inside his polyester-woven neuroses in LA's valley suburbs.  The movie takes an expressionistic tact and presents the world in a stylized, cacophonous manner, as Barry experiences it.While intellectually the approach makes sense and is perhaps even admirable on some abstract level, the result is like watching Ray Liotta's crackup-under-the-helicopter scene in Goodfellas on an endless loop for 90 minutes, or, in short: unbearable.As the film winds down the movie actually becomes quite sweet, and we're reminded of why we like Anderson's better movies:  he has a talent for extracting real romance from uncomfortable and even unlikable characters. Punch-Drunk Love, though, exhibits none of the lyricism, humor or irony that Anderson harnessed in Magnolia and Boogie Nights' exploration of the lives of similarly dysfunctional Valley residents.  Like the Coen brothers' more irritating products (Barton Fink, The Big Lebowski), Punch-Drunk Love is really a mind-numbing exercise in making a movie with only the ugly crayons in the box.",Punch-Drunk Love

T. Anderson's Jackie Brown. When it comes to Adam Sandler as an actor, you can either love or hate him... and most would fall into the hate category. However, even most Sandler haters would think that his performance in Punch-Drunk Love is fantastic, and it's not only Sandler that makes the film such an exquisite masterwork. The cinematography and score pulls you into an unusual and dreamy world that is sweet and empathetic. P. T. Anderson's usual trickery works here as Adam Sandler along with Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman give impeccable performances.

200,HardKnockLife210,Beautifully Unique,8,6 December 2003,"The first time I heard of ""Punch Drunk Love"" was when it was nominated for Best Musical or Comedy at the 2002 Golden Globes.  It couldn't have won, obviously, because ""Chicago"" was also in that category.  But, really, now that I've seen ""Punch Drunk Love,"" I know that it can't really be compared to ""Chicago"" (and not to ""Nicholas Nickleby"" either).  But anyways, they really can't be compared because ""Chicago"" is an artful adaptation, while ""Punch Drunk Love"" has obviously not been adapted from anything except maybe a ""Time"" article and Paul Thomas Anderson's imagination.Yet it is ""Punch Drunk Love""'s uniquity that makes it so beautiful.  The movie really makes no sense, but it's not really supposed to make sense at all.  Bashing this movie for being unrealistic is bashing ""Mary Poppins"" for the sole reason that nannies can't fly, even with umbrellas.  Also, Jon Brian's score is definitely not a score that you would hear in any other movie.  And, while in several movies (especially comedies), you couldn't notice the cinematography if you tried, the way in which Robert Elswit films ""Punch Drunk Love"" is a short distance away from being perfect. 
I do, as usual, have some complaints, but only two:  1) The acting was great for the most part, but Emily Watson was a little off on occasion 2) The ""sexual dialogue"" scene was quite repulsive.  Yes, it does set the stage for the rest of the stuff that happens in the movie, but it's still disgusting. I know you're probably saying that ""Saving Private Ryan,"" too, was disgusting to some people.  Well, good for them.  I still felt that the sexual dialogue took something away from the movie.In conclusion, when you see this movie, keep an open mind.  It is strange, but it has a whole 'nother level that you won't notice otherwise.Final Grade: A-.",Punch-Drunk Love
201,stodruza,"If you build it, they may not come.",10,18 November 2005,"PDL is a simple story. Through his quirkiness and malady, Barry Egan, a maladjusted young man in the plunger business, finds the love of his life with Lena Leonard. In doing so, he discovers two of the most cherished things that love can offer: strength and purpose.Punch Drunk Love stars Adam Sandler (the first time I have seen him) and Emily Watson in the most endearing, artful, and yes, somewhat minimalistic (brilliantly done) romantic comedy to date. Anderson's second masterpiece (Magnolia) does not come close to perfection, it achieves it quite effortlessly.I would never write a film like Punch Drunk Love. Its theme seems too simple, uninteresting, and not worth the energy. Through it's severe limitations and simplicity, Anderson creates genius. I know, I know, the most brilliant things are most often simple. What I mean by its limitations is that there is no information that Anderson is working with here, just the human condition, no grand premise. That can successfully be argued, of course, since what could be grander than love. To further clarify, for myself, he takes a plain white piece of paper and some pencils, and colors and folds it to create the most beautiful piece of origami that I have ever seen.There is nothing wrong with this film, that is to say that it is flawless. The only way to try to make it more appealing to a broader audience is to cut out the art crap and dumb it up. Maybe, involve an unnecessary subplot featuring another character, perhaps one of his sisters, who starts out winning and through a series of events ends up where Barry Egan starts.From what I can figure out, the manageable box office failure of PDL primarily stemmed from audience expectations surrounding an Adam Sandler film. In the simplest terms, if the film cost less money, it would have been a success. Concerning the questions and the challenges of producing Paul Thomas Anderson, I would have to conclude that the main challenge is not weather or not he is going to make a great film, as that has almost turned into a given, but one of how much money to give him, and two: to get the film down to a length to please distributors, and finally three: to be able to communicate and work with the marketing person or people effectively to come and see his films.If P.T. Anderson has really learned his lesson from Magnolia, then he is ready to go. That lesson, I think, being that making a film with a length compatible with the attention span of the modern movie-goer and is the correct move any way you look at it. With advertising costs, the film broke even at the box office, domestic and foreign combined, leaving the profit, as it were, solely in the ancillary markets. I'm not sure this is completely acceptable for investors. But with Anderson's talent and drive, it is sure that he will get his films made. Why not make a film that people will go and see, and release one's opus on DVD? And how is it humanly possible that the Academy not to even nominate Magnolia for best picture, much less give it, thankfully, the top prize? I am briefly reminded when in Foreman's Amadeus, Salieri says of Mozart's genius that it is too much, the emperor has an attention span of two hours, he gives him four...The lesson here, is also a simple one; If you build it they may not come.",Punch-Drunk Love

I really didn't see much of an entertaining nor artistic value in this, and from my point of view, it lacked the idea. There was a very slight crime plot. That's all the movie actually had.

204,HunterDK,This movie was a big pain,2,14 March 2003,"I have just watched ""Punch-Drunk Love"", and I was not impressed at all. Here at IMDb the users had given it 7,8, but I must say that I do not agree.If I should tell what the movie was about, then I could not say much more than extortion and that you should be careful to give away your credit card number. The rest of the movie is just silly like a stupid dream, which really does not make sense. I am sure that most people would agree that making a film of a dream would make a horrible movie, and that is the result with ""Punch-Drunk Love"".The actors actually do an acceptable job, but the script is just horrible and doomed from the first line. The director and writer Paul Thomas Anderson must have a sick mind, because this movie is really terrible. I do not know how he could accept this final cut as being near acceptable, but the script was doomed from the first line as I mentioned earlier, so it was maybe impossible for him to save it in the editing room.Apparently many IMDb users like this type of movie, but I think these people just like something twisted and in some way bizarre. This movie is both twisted and bizarre, but not good.""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the worst movie I have seen in 2003 so far, and hopefully it will not change. It deserves 2/10, and it is not because I give extremely poor ratings normally, but I really hate this movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
205,yespat,What was this about?,3,21 November 2004,"And why did all the reviewers love it so much? I was eagerly awaiting seeing this film as every review made it sound so fantastic. I kept waiting for something to happen and waiting for things to be explained/resolved to no avail. It had an interesting look and I suppose Adam Sandler did an adequate job thought it's hard to tell exactly as I could never figure out what he was trying to convey. He seemed kind of wimpy then at times, super strong then at other times crazy with anxiety then, other times seemed super confident. I really can't tell what he was trying to achieve. I'm not at all certain that he was given the opportunity to explain more clearly given the story line. And the part (SPOILER) about the pudding and frequent flier miles and his not knowing that he had to wait 6-8 weeks for processing of his airline coupon seemed far fetched and was merely a weak plot device. This was particularly true given that early in the film he was seen pouring over the coupon requirements and going so far as to call the company seeking exact details of the offer. It seems to me that if he would have taken that much effort to understand the offer, he would clearly have known or found out that the ticket is not an instantaneous offer that one takes immediately to the airport. How could he have gotten to the point of such rage when he found out that he could not use the ticket immediately upon purchasing the last unit of pudding?There were a lot of blind alleys in this film, giving the hint of something profound about to happen and nothing ever did. I guess that was the most disappointing to me, waiting for the profound to happen and nothing ever did.The only reason to see this film is to see the ever luminescent Emily Watson. She is wonderful.",Punch-Drunk Love
206,crowes-18865,How Do I Put This,7,20 November 2020,"Where do I begin with Mr. Adam Sandler? Well... I hate him. Do I hate him because he is completely talentless? No. Frankly, quite the opposite. I hate him because every now and then he decides to remind us that he can act with one random entry floating on its own little island in a sea of crap. This is that one island dwelling gem swimming in that sea full of turds if you'll pardon the crudeness. In this his whole slightly brain damaged thing just really works for the role and the angry outbursts and masterfully performed. This is a quirky, funny and sad film all in one package and it is really quite good. But is there a formula to use to judge which Sandler projects to see? Nope, complete wild card which goes something like crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, Punch Drunk Love, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap, Uncut Gems, crap, crap, crap, crap. There is some talent buried deep within this individual but either he cares not for the quality of his work or he needs to fire his agent. But do see this one though because it is proof positive of the reason I hate one Mr. Adam Sandler.",Punch-Drunk Love

I continually gasped and gawked and marvelled at the sheer artistry and beauty of the direction and cinematography.  And Adam Sandler made me cry.  What more could you ask for from a movie?PDL doesn't have the epic scope of Magnolia, nor does it evoke a whole  era with the wonderful thoroughness of Boogie Nights.  It's not an particularly ambitious movie (except for the part of ambitious that automatically goes with audacious).  But it's easily P.T. Anderson's most accomplished film to date.  If there's a more talented filmmaker walking the planet, I'd like to know who he is.",Punch-Drunk Love
208,drunken_critic,Best movie in awhile,10,21 November 2003,"I remember idolizing the comedy of Adam Sandler in high school. He was on remote control, and the characters he played like stud boy was hilarious; however, I never liked his movies like Big Daddy, Happy Gilmore, Going Overboard, Billy Madison, and The Water boy. I think his best movie before this was Little Nicky. Punch Drunk Love falls into the great category. I want to definitely see it again when it comes out on DVD. I might even buy it. The best way to describe the movie is with what a movie viewer said to his friend after leaving the theater 'very strange movie'. Yes it was! It was greatly strange and different. It's not a movie that backward hat wearing frat boy would like. This movie was about an insecure guy that I can relate to and how he deals with fear and frustration. I love the way he falls in love. His love was sincere and uncomfortable and unfamiliar, just like real love feels. Adam Sandler was funny even though his part wasn't supposed to be funny. His human reactions are funny, because its relates to life. It only lasted one week at the Theater. I enjoyed it so much I would have liked to have seen it again at the theater, but I guess it was too strange for the general public. It did not fall into the mindless typical Adam Sandler movie. I read by Roger Ebert that it is a commercial art film. An art film with a big star. Adam Sandler definitely made it work, and he pulled off a hidden humor that another actor could not.One of my favorite scenes of the movie is in Hawaii. He sits at the table on the beach with his girlfriend and doesn't say anything just smiling at each other. He does not have to. The situation is beautiful and meaningful and to add script would have been meaningless. It was moving when she takes his hand and quietly take a walk. Enjoying the moment. I enjoyed and felt the moment also. 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love
209,billcody,This is not a good movie.,3,10 October 2002,"Film geeks will applaud this movie. They will marvel at all the goofy little things like the casting of actual sisters and cousins as the sisters (ignoring the fact that while they all look alike - they don't look anything like Mary Lynne Ruskub - who is the only sister with any lines really) and ignore the fact that the couple of scenes they are in are minor and that the story behind the casting is far more interesting than anything actually on screen!BUT - when it plays the multi-plexes the average Joe will be P.O.'ed that they plunked down six bucks for such a pretentious self masterbatory piece of crap. And they will right! The film geeks will want to believe that they are deeper than the average Joe and that they are somehow superior - but in fact they are ""the suckers"" that are born every minute.The biggest problem with this film is that the press notes are far more detailed and informative than the movie - the talk about Barry's relationship with his seven sisters - the explanation about his neurosis - none of this is really central to the movie itself. There is one scene where he gets a few phone calls from several of his sisters, and a scene where he talks to his brother-in-law about his ""feelings"" - but all of this is quickly dropped and/or ignored. As far as the repeated notion that this is a romantic comedy - well, only if you consider a movie devoid of humor and romance a ""romantic comedy"". I'm sure some people will claim that Thomas is deconstructing the standard romantic comedy but I've always believed that you can't deconstruct something unless you know how to construct it in the first place. Nothing in this flick is explored in any depth and after viewing the film I was left with that Peggy Lee ""is that all there is"" feeling. There was no there there as they say.I don't know. I used to think Anderson was our great hope for developing an important film maker here in the US but I'm losing faith. Magnolia was an overstuffed messy film, and this is just a w**k-off session. Maybe what we've got here is the first confirmed student film maker to get studio backing.Bottom line - if you're a film student and want to see some interesting scenes this movie might be worth seeing - but if you are the average filmgoer looking for an enjoyable time at the movies you might want to check out something else.",Punch-Drunk Love

But I was not a fan of Punch Drunk Love.Here, we have an example of a great director trying to be someone he's not; is he a victim of the masses who expect something a slight bit on the quirky side? or was he going for the ""art film"" look in every shot just because he could?Either way, it does not succeed in my book. I've loved PT Anderson's films up until this point, but with this one, it seemed like he was trying too hard to impress the audience and give them (us) something new. For me, it didn't work. It MAY have worked with a first time director trying to find his/her style, but not a vet who already has both a mainstream AND a cult following. This one tried too hard to satisfy that cult following- and this member of that cult saw right through the artsy stuff and wondered why he chose to do something that's so obviously ""fake.""

211,dillylamar,Punch-Drunk Love,10,13 April 2020,"Paul Thomas Anderson delivers an amazing film, that differs from his others in many ways. Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a lonely, timid, and seemingly awkward man, who is very susceptible to violent outbursts, but is still a nice man. He owns his own buisness, that is isn't much of a success. The way you feel the pure unpleasance and discomfort of Barry is remarkable, as you travel with him as he navigates the situations he is in. Barry miserable life takes a turn when he meets the somewhat lonely, yet kindhearted Lena. This film has a lot of offer, its short, tight, and fresh, with a great perfomance from Sandler. Who uses his expressions to create a unique feel to the film, while commanding the screen with his character's explosive anger. Beatifully unconventional cinematograpy, camerawork, and editing. The plot is unique, bizzare, and new, with a stunning script, and a perfect mix of a comedy, romance, drama, and thriller, in a way that makes the polar opposite of generic. The film can differ from reality a little bit, but delivers a sense of optimism that isnt corny, bland, or forced. The film is also filled with suspense, and the quality of unpredicability that you may not expect to find. The film contains marvelous attention to detail when it comes to its subtext in communication. A beautiful, poetic, fresh, and bizzare film that is utterly human, and unforgettable.

It took a lot of cajoling and promises from friends that he doesn't do ""the voice,"" but I held my breath and watched.Aaah, this film was slowly-paced, unique, emotionally gripping, and Sandler never does ""the voice."" In fact, at once point, I heard myself say ""C'mon Barry,"" because he had sold me on being the character. And I just love Emily Watson - she never fails to amaze me.So for those of you wanting or expecting Happy Billy Gilmore Madison the Waterboy, you will be sadly disappointed.And that, I am very glad to say. 3 1/2 stars, 9/10, and both my thumbs up.",Punch-Drunk Love
216,HulkVader,A good effort,7,30 October 2002,"A creative attempt at avant-garde film making which, for the most part, succeeds.  Very quirky usage of both dialogue and sound, and the characters are well portrayed.  It's obvious that Barry's bi-polarity can be, in no small measure, traced back to his relationships with his seven sisters, each of whom walk all over Barry as if her were a rug.  Truly, every time one of them confronts Barry, he walks himself directly into the nearest corner of whatever room he happens to be in.  Conversely, Lena is tragically lonely due, in part, to her being an only child.  This aspect of her character was not explored sufficiently.  However, the two manage to come together for the satisfaction of their own raging insecurities.  The phone sex aspect of the film was quite funny, if not over done.  Surely, there will be those who simply say, ""So two losers end up with each other, big deal.""  But, not unlike in Sex, Lies & Videotape, these strange people find a way to end their solitude and find comfort in one another.  That should be the moral of the story.  If I may interject on a personal note: Lena was obviously a fairly successful business woman.  I mean to say that she was sent on a business trip to Hawaii and stayed in a nice, beach-front resort, and an employer does not send a dog employee on such a trip, she must have been good at whatever she did.  (Which makes me wonder why she owned such a junky car). And frankly, cute, intelligent, successful, single women - if they exist at all =) - needn't go to such lengths as Lena did in this film (operating under the charade of a broken car) to find a man.  They will come to her in droves.  Trust me on this one.",Punch-Drunk Love

Thats not to say there isn't the standard Sandler-stickh there; there sure is, but at least its buried. - Emily Watson - beauty combined with that accent... <sigh>I was surprised by a few things:its short running time (90 minutes!) - its small leading cast (it is essentially a two-hander between Sandler and Watson) - this film is essentially a love story,  A very personal love story.I was annoyed by a few thingslacklustre script development - the story of the sex line and the thugs behind it is poorly developed; it also does not integrate into the story to the level I thought I would and expected from PTA.  The love interest is rushed and falls into some cliched traps - lazy camera work - if there is one thing abouta  PTA film is the ways the camera is made to sing - PDL had little to be impressed byI remain undecided about a few thingsthe kooky elements; the piano on the street, the pudding, the crashing car - seemed out of place - the message of the movie - it seemed to me to be a story about the troubles communicating in the modern world - I'm probably wrong but if I am perhaps it needed to be developed a bit more?Not bad.

218,jakespick,The Meaning of Originality: Punch-Drunk Love Review,10,23 November 2008,"...every once in a long while you find a film that can be both extremely believable and yet so far away that its strange. This is one of those films. Often called Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece, Punch-Drunk Love is my favorite Adam Sandler film...but not my favorite P.T. Anderson film. Magnolia is my favorite PT Anderson film.The strong feeling of danger, love and hilarity builds and builds as the story progresses. One thing people complain to me about is the full-time music in the background. However, I feel that is one of the more original aspects of Punch-Drunk Love: its ability to keep you hooked even if you don't like it. You may not like the film, but you still want to know EXACTLY what happens and you do, kind of, care about the characters.I hated this film the first time I saw it, not knowing what I was going into, due to my inexperience in watching PT Anderson films. This was my first of his that I've watched, the second being Magnolia, the third being Hard Eight, the fourth being Boogie Nights and the fifth being There Will Be Blood. All of his films have this feel of intense danger, power-hungry wants, needs, happiness, love, care, joy, and the inability to cope with the problems at hand.This is a perfect comment on the alienated, unloved, and unknown society living in our little suburban worlds. It's the ultimate cliché, yet it's one of the most original films I've ever seen. That is ALSO a very original aspect of Punch-Drunk Love and the brilliance of each and everyone of PT Andersons films: He uses clichés in an original way.In conclusion, Adam Sandler puts on a performance of a life-time, with odd resemblance to his character in Reign Over Me. This is, probably, Paul Thomas Anderson's most original work (not his best). If you enjoy a calm, relaxed, sit-back-and-enjoy kind of film...this one is NOT for you. If you enjoy an 80-minute film with 4-hour film potential, filled with non-stop comedy, awkward moments, quotable lines and the strong sense of catastrophe...then this is perfect for you...being as this is: THE MEANING OF ORIGINALITY.",Punch-Drunk Love

221,Kevin_Maness,"PT Anderson will need to make at least 2 really good, non-Adam-Sandler movies to make up for this crap",3,8 June 2006,"I like P.T. Anderson. I liked Boogie Nights a whole lot, and I really loved Magnolia (despite that fact that some of my best friends found it to be nauseatingly bad), but it's taken me this long to finally see Punch-Drunk Love. You see, I really think Adam Sandler is one of the worst things to happen to Hollywood since the Production Code. I really don't like him or his movies. He's one of those SNL alums who demonstrates perfectly why some people are good at sketch comedy while other people are good film actors--he's only funny for about 3 minutes at a time, and not always funny for that long. Anyway, for some reason I've lumped this movie and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind together in my head as two movies people liked and that I should see. When I finally saw Eternal Sunshine (and really liked it) I guess I just figured it was time to see Punch-Drunk Love.Or, maybe not. I really thought it was horrible. It's like 10 different ideas for 10 different decent movies all thrown together and then stirred a little bit and half-baked. It was a little like a Coen brothers film--quirky and random (think Raising Arizona or The Big Lebowski), but it was, at best, a cheap knock-off of the Coens. Adam Sandler was, well, Adam Sandler...again--childish without being innocent or cute, pathetic without invoking sympathy, and spastic without being funny (I'm not a big Jim Carey fan either, but his physical humor is miles beyond that of Sandler). I would have liked him so much better if he stuck to singing those silly spoof songs to his own lovably lame guitar playing on SNL, mugging for the camera and laughing at his own jokes and funny faces.The plot of the film is incidental, at best. Don't worry about trying to keep track of it or ""figure it out"" because it just doesn't matter. All that matters is Adam Sandler and what/who he'll beat up next when they mention the sliding door and the hammer. Don't get me wrong--a lot of great movies are less plot based and more character based, but this is a movie based on a character who is one dimensional, played by an actor whose thespian aspiration is to develop one full dimension. It just didn't work for me.It's a shame, really, because Emily Watson is a fine actress, and she's inexplicably adorable here in this movie. What a waste. (Also falling into the ""what a waste"" column is Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance--why would a great actor like him even agree to be in this movie, let alone to play such an under-developed, oops-we-didn't-cut-this-guy-all-the-way-out-of-the-movie character?) Did I mention that I didn't like this movie? Don't see it. You'll want those 90 minutes back, but there's just no way to get them.",Punch-Drunk Love

223,praveen77,An acquired taste...,7,29 September 2009,"Though Paul Thomas Anderson is a feted director, especially for his Oscar nominated 'There will be blood', somehow that movie did not really live up to the hype for me. Over here, there were a couple of things which were worth applauding, but at the end of the day, I think his movies are more of an acquired taste. This movie is basically a love story interspersed with a character study.Adam Sandler plays Barry Eagen, a small business owner, who has certain behavioral problems and doesn't seem to have much of an opportunity to socialize. Apart from his seven sisters, with whom he seems to have a love-hate relationship. So much so that, when they make fun of a childhood incident of his at a family gathering, he suddenly breaks the window glass.Then a couple of things happen. First, he finds an old harmonica somebody abandoned on the road, and takes it back, calling it a piano. And he meets his sister's friend, Lena, with whom suddenly, love blossoms. And, more unfortunately, out of loneliness one night, he calls up a sex chat. Since they get all his details out of him, the lady calls him back the next day threatening him, unless he gives her money. Oh, and he also finds a loophole in an advertising campaign which sells free flyer miles, so he decides to stock up on that too. The rest of the movie deals with how each of these comes to pass and his reactions to each.One thing you cannot argue with are the performances. Especially Sandler. I never really believed he was capable of anything other than the goof ball comedies he does, but here he seems to perfectly capture the oddities and eccentricities of his essentially sad character amazingly well. Emily Watson is also great as Lena, though you do wonder why she seems so desperately after this guy, even when it seems tough to find redeeming qualities in him. Probably one of the reasons I will say this is a good movie, but hardly a great one.",Punch-Drunk Love
224,Movies8586,"Simple, strange, sweet!",10,20 February 2003,"Paul Thomas Anderson's PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE is undoubtedly the strangest romantic comedy I have ever seen. However, I was completely blown away by how sweet it was, how ""real"" the two characters of Barry and Lena were drawn.Adam Sandler gives the best performance of his career as a man who has spent his whole life running away from love. Emily Watson is simply adorable as the mysterious woman who comes into his life and shows him the ups and downs of a relationship. As always, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are great fun to watch.Anderson deserves an Oscar for writing this simple, strange, and sweet concoction. It is one of the year's best films.",Punch-Drunk Love
225,kmberger,Heartwrenching - but not quite perfect.,8,15 November 2002,"This is only Paul Thomas Anderson's fourth film, but he's already earned a reputation as an auteur, an actor's director, and the hippest thing in Hollywood.  He also has been guilty of letting his movies go on a bit too long and in meandering directions, and being prone to pretentiousness in setting his scenes.  Either way, he's not a director who compromises.  So it's something of a surprise that 'Punch-Drunk Love' is less of a sprawling collective of dysfunction than his previous films, and more of a focused drama on one man's search for happiness and acceptance.Adam Sandler is that man, Barry Egan, an LA entrepreneur with seven sisters. Barry suffers from a severe bipolar disorder that can manifest itself in sudden outbursts of violence and depression.  His sisters don't help matters much, reminding him constantly of past embarrassments and constantly harping on his current life's situations.  Things begin to change for Barry when he finds an old harmonium in the streets, begins to wear a suit to work, and is introduced to Lena Leonard (Emily Watson).  This leads him along an awkward and difficult path where he finally explores his own personal demons and opens himself to someone else - perhaps for the first time.Sandler is the story here, as the entire movie revolves around him, to the extent that most camera angles take his point of view (even following him through his paces as he walks through doors and hallways.  We always know what's going on with Barry.).  The rest of the characters exist to frame Barry's disorder.  His sisters provide his anxiety; his coworkers are bystanders to his eccentricity; Lena is his outlet to his tender side; and the porn hotline he calls (and causes him endless troubles in one of the films weaker sidelines) preys on his desperation.  This tactic does a few things: some good, some bad.  On the good side, it focuses the film unlike any of P.T. Anderson's previous works, which were mostly ensemble pieces ('Hard Eight' was a smaller cast, but still revolved around three people.).  Everything is invested in Barry's twists and turns and his bipolar tendencies.  He's a complete jerk one scene, then a sympathetically distraught fool the next.  It's to Sandler's credit that he doesn't go too far over the top with this role.  There's humor there, but it's mostly understated.  Sandler's Barry rarely makes eye contact with anyone for too long, almost never smiles or laughs genuinely, and seems eternally on the edge between total breakdown and euphoria.  It's a tight line to hold, but Sandler does a creditable job.  It's entirely on his shoulders to keep the picture together.The downside to all of this is that the rest of the cast is left mostly in the dark.  We don't know too much about Lena Leonard, other than she travels quite a bit and seems to have endless patience towards Barry's disaffections.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is given a thankless role as the owner of the porn line that tries to defraud Barry - then physically assault him in a very incongruous plot that doesn't really work well. Hoffman is game for the role, as he is for every part he takes, but there just isn't anything for him to do other than swear up a storm and act like a total sleaze.  With the focus so totally on Barry, this is expected, but still disappointing - there's a lot more story involved in these other characters.Taken at face value, 'Punch-Drunk Love' is a story of one man's struggles to overcome himself and establish his own identity.  It runs a little deeper than that, as the world acts as Barry's shadow, guiding him along to places he probably never would have found on his own.  It's alternately uncomfortable, shocking, silly, tender, and unpredictable.  P.T. Anderson has made probably his most accessible film to date, holding back the reins and letting Adam Sandler have his day in the sun as a dramatic actor.  He's up to the task, and the film is a testament to his efforts.  An imperfect Anderson film is still quite a sight to behold.",Punch-Drunk Love

Philip Seymour Hoffman fares even worse as the mastermind of a phone-sex racket headquartered in a furniture store.  His character has no dimension and less sense.  This is one of those highbrow films obviously directed and written by people who say that there are no original plotlines, so therefore, plot is irrelevant.  Hence, they spend all their time exposing the quirkiness and absurdity of an array of oddball and obnoxiously funny (a la Seinfeld) characters.Sorry, guys.  For this viewer, plot is the center of movie satisfaction. Without it, the whole experience feels like being cheated.",Punch-Drunk Love
230,Oliver-50,Superb in all respects,8,18 November 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson is one of those few directors out there nowadays who can deliver a film that doesn't toy with your emotions but allows you to experience a wide range of them. Hard Eight, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia are films that cannot be classified into a specific genre just because you feel so many different things. And once again P.T. Anderson delivers another brilliant film. Although not as exceptional as Boogie Nights, Punch Drunk Love is the best film I've seen in quite some time.I won't give away any key plot points just because i knew very little about the film going into it, and was completely surprised by the story, the plot twists, the characters, and the performances. When I heard Adam Sandler was starring I got a little concerned. How could the comedian who played Happy Gilmore show anything besides basic emotions; eg happy, sad, angry...well he does. Maybe it's because he's under the direction of the glorious PT Anderson or maybe he's always been a great overlooked actor. Whatever the case, Adam Sandler blew me away giving an earnest performance that warrants an oscar nomination. And when that time comes i hope they will reward an actor who has finally been able to show off his exceptional talent. So kudos to Anderson and Sandler for making the best movie of the year, hands down!",Punch-Drunk Love
231,FranktheRabbit,The Strangest Thing I've Ever Seen...,10,27 October 2002,"I went into this movie expecting it to be strange, and believe me, it was. I also thought that Adam Sandler couldn't pull it off, but he did.The film starts out like a dream sequence that you would find only in a Fellini film. A car crashes, and a piano is left in the street. Barry (Sandler), takes the piano in his possession and pretty soon his whole life is turned upside down. Barry is a paranoid private business owner with social anxiety. He has problems and doesn't know how to talk to people. But as soon as the piano comes in his possession, his life begins to change. First, he calls a sex-line and pretty soon people start to come after him. Second, he starts to by $$$ worth of ""Healthy Choice"" food, in hopes of getting Frequent Flyer Miles. And third, he falls in love.This film is an interesting Mosaic of a man, and three different factors that affect his life. I really liked it. I thought the music was great, as well as the art direction. I was also very surprised by Sandler, who I thought, pulled it off very well. So in the end, I'm still not sure weather I have figured this film out yet, or if there is anything to figure out, but I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something that you don't see everyday.",Punch-Drunk Love
232,Art Snob,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!,4,17 September 2002,"It never fails ... a movie star generates a billion dollars in film revenues by making a series of lowbrow films that are wildly successful despite consistent critical lambasting (read: Jim Carrey), and as soon as said star makes even a token gesture towards `legit' acting, the same (ignored) critics can't stop heaping praise upon the `breakout' vehicle.
This process has already begun for Adam Sandler's PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE.  Having just seen the movie with a decidedly-underwhelmed audience at the 2002 Toronto Film Festival, all I can say is ... DON'T BELIEVE THE COMING HYPE ONSLAUGHT!  The film may be a lot more stylized than the typical Sandler movie  leading befuddled critics to conclude that there HAS to be some deep meaning lurking in there someplace  but at its core, this film is about as deep as THE WATERBOY.I suppose that it could be deemed a `romantic comedy,' except that the comedy is practically nonexistent and the romance seems strictly perfunctory.  But NO ... listen to the critics carp on endlessly about what the harmonium is supposed to symbolize and the significance of Sandler wearing the same blue suit for the entire duration of the film, no matter what the venue.  (All the time conveniently ignoring the blatant in-your-face product plugs for the `Healthy Choice' food line, of course.) 
Don't be misled by the names in the supporting cast, because this is Sandler's baby, top-to-bottom ... everyone else is just along for the ride, including supposed co-star Emily Watson.  Especially wasted are Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman, regulars in director Paul Thomas Anderson's movies.  Guzman's part is merely expositional (he also gets to push a shopping cart), and if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen half of Hoffman's screen time.A Sandler tantrum in HAPPY GILMORE?  Schtick!  A Sandler tantrum in a Paul Thomas Anderson movie?  ACTING!  That's what the critics will have you believe.  I say that even `noble failure' is overpraise when it comes to describing this film.",Punch-Drunk Love

That said, it was delightful for those seeking an eccentric film with a personality, far away from the usual mold.  And so, like -The Big Lebowksi- (1998), it will have lasting appeal and impact, and therefore won't be going away (unlike, say, the Best Picture Oscar-winner of 1998 . ..

235,jeev7882,...a mess of a movie that tries harder and harder to be something that it's simply not.,5,4 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Punch-Drunk Love is a mess of a movie that tries harder and harder to be something that it's simply not. The very beginning practically tells us that it would either be a great movie filled with meaningful symbolism and wonderful characters, or an absurd and terribly put together piece that seems more like a work-in-progress. Director Paul Anderson has been given an incredible amount of praise that he simply does not deserve for this movie. Instead, the DP (director of photography), whose name I can't seem to dig up, has done a very good job in picking out some nuances of So-Cal to enhance the feel of the story and our characters.The big talk about this movie is definitely about Adam Sandler. And, Sandler rightfully deserves some praise for his portrayal of the emotionally closed off (and partially insane) Barry Egan. But, if you're like me and you grew up watching him on SNL and have seen all of his movies, you'll be able to see that this isn't a big stretch for him. It's like asking Jenny McCarthy to play a porn star in a drama; ok, maybe it's a little different than tha t, but the point remains the same. Still, the small comic quirks from Sandler are very well timed so you do get to see some vintage Sandler humor when appropriate. Emily Watson is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses. Her role in Red Dragon was small but she nailed it, and she does the same here with a bigger role in a much sloppier film. She has a certain charm about her that is rare and a lot of talent to back it up. Here she plays Lena Leonard, probably the most normal and likeable character in the film. She really understands Barry and gives him the one outlet he needs to help with his problems. The highlights of the film are the silent moments when Barry puts himself in a potentially embarrassing situation that Lena alleviates by just brushing it off in one way or another. This movie could have been fairly interesting if it would have focused on Barry, Lena, and their immediate surroundings.This movie is very dark and therefore very weird at different points. Some of the scene transitions are a psychedelic mixture of colors that you usually see to represent people getting high or a movie about the 70's. They serve no purpose and they go further to completely alienate an already restless audience (much of which left during different portions of the film). There is a subplot where Barry buys hundreds of packs of pudding to redeem the frequent flyer miles. Besides being based on a true event, it is insignificant and it takes us further from Barry's character than we should ever be. Here is a strange guy who breaks out crying in an instant and has a flock of sisters constantly bothering him at work about his personal life. He has problems with opening up and finding someone to talk to. He gets so desperate that he calls a phone sex line to talk to one of their girls about himself. This spawns another strange subplot, but this one is more relevant and it actually ties in quite well to the rest of the story. After taking all of his information, the four blond brothers come after Barry after he refuses to give the phone sex girl money to pay her ""rent."" (hint: it's a scam). The brothers mess him up good the first time they find him, but the second time presents Barry with a chance to grow and show what his love of Lena has done to his life.If this isn't enough, the very beginning showcases a car crash and then a harmonium being dropped off on the street. Purpose of the car crash: to show us that Barry is an individual capable of exploding in seemingly normal and tranquil moments. Successful stories never tell us how our characters act and feel, they show us. I personally am not a big fan of symbolism that does not add to the story. The car crash does give us some base for Barry's character, but it just seems inappropriate, or unintelligent rather, to have it at the beginning of the film. The harmonium on the other hand may be the most interesting symbolic object in the entire movie, but you really have to convince yourself of it. Barry ""saves"" the harmonium in the street as it is about to be run over by a truck. The harmonium is an interesting inanimate representation of Barry. It has been wounded, damaged, and especially neglected like Barry. Barry plays the harmonium from time to time and even tries to fix it up with duct tape. Eventually, he brings the harmonium to Lena's place as if to tell her ""look at the changed Barry Egan."" If this sounds kind of like a stretch, it's because it is to some degree. There are about 100 things I could pull out of this movie and ponder on for a while, but walking out of the movie I really just didn't care enough to do that.",Punch-Drunk Love
236,filmbuff20,PT to a T.,9,15 December 2007,"The key aspect to appreciating Paul Thomas Anderson's work is knowing before going in, that you may NOT appreciate it first time round. PT's work is an acquired taste. He utilises several devices which can be off putting to some, but absolute genius to others, such as a long wide angle takes, juxtaposing music and images to get a feeling rather than to strike a simplistic emotional tick box and realistic but stylised dialogue, delivered almost spontaneously. These aspects create a rich film experience, even if some can't quite grasp it. All of his previous films contained these things; Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia were all PT Anderson movies to a T. Punch Drunk Love on the other hand, is a little more towards the abstract, eliciting feeling and empathy as opposed to simply showing a conventional story.A lot of the criticism of Punch Drunk Love is inevitably down to the disgruntled Sandler fans expecting a farce. Well, this movie is funny in it's own quiet, offbeat manner. Sandler's performance is captivating, a heightened verisimilitude of his on-screen persona, hyped almost to insanity, while at the same time quiet and introverted. It's a difficult role and one that he should have had more acclaim for. It's another proof that comedians make some of the best dramatic actors. Another stand out notable is Philip Seymour Hoffman, briefly on screen, but stealing every scene he's in.I rate this film high, not only because of it's undeniable brilliance and the fact that if I ever met Anderson I would have to shake his hand enthusiastically and beg him to tell me how he does it, but also because I know that when I inevitably revisit this film again, I will have a whole new experience. Everything here is symbolic of something and I look forward to seeing what I missed the first time round with the benefit of hindsight.Recommended to anyone with more than a passing interest in film and a bit of patience with which to experience a small masterpiece.",Punch-Drunk Love

Then, falls in love in a quirky way. SOUND VAGUELY PLAIN? SO GOES THE MOVIE THEME. But, not without some snares along the way, like the Phone-sex sequence. The rest of the cast I didn't follow much. The cast seemed to support the main character Barry Egan, Adam Sandler's role as the oddball business gawky guy who takes up a date with Emily Watson's role as Lena Leonard. Guess love at first sight. Well, NOT MUCH PUNCH to this dark psycho-comedy-romance for sure.

238,martinlucas-469-207968,The mystery of 1/10 and 10/10 ratings for the same film,9,25 July 2018,"Like many other members of IMDb I notice constantly that some films attract a crop of completely binary reviews, often being loved and hated in equal measure. 'Punch Drunk Love' is a case in point. Hundreds of user reviews rail at its improbable story line littered with ludicrous incidents and bizarre characterisations. They are often very angry: ""Don't waste your time on this rubbish"", "" This crap stole an hour and a half of my life"" etc. An equal number celebrate yet another example of the work of an award winning director, drawing attention it's wonderful evocation of a certain kind of reality, plus characters and a plot line that are completely unpredictable right up to the last moment. ""Perhaps the best film I've ever seen"" etc.The paradox perhaps lies in our assumption that film is not just a medium but a genre. Different directors and writers use the medium in a variety of ways but thanks perhaps to the conventional two line hooker promotions that a company like Netflix uses to set up a film, many viewers are deeply disappointed when a film doesn't meet their perfectly proper expectations of a good old drama or thriller using conventional plot traditions and character types that they can recognise.So, my advice is, before you rush to rubbish a film, have a look at its antecedents: the directors track record,( in this case that of P.T. Anderson), the producer's other films, the writers, etc. Looking at other people's reviews, try and see what those who love the film are getting from it, and please take me seriously when say that 'Punch Drink Love"" is one of the most moving and refreshing movies I've ever seen.

But I was told countless times that it was not an ""Adam Sandler"" film. After seeing it, I felt that Adam Sandler did in fact play his stereotypical role, just like the rest of his films.  The difference is that it was harnessed differently and very appropriate for the role.This movie kept me guessing from beginning to end, despite such a truly basic plot.  I thought it illustrated the feelings of a ""crush"" or ""punch drunk love"" exceptionally well, stripping Sandler's feelings down to true instinct and gut reaction.  On that level, I found myself relating to his character often.  There were also times that I wasn't sure if I was supposed to laugh or cry, which is difficult to provoke.  The cinematography was gorgeous and the humor was very fresh.This is one of P.T. Anderson's classics and a must see for anyone who enjoys off the wall or offbeat films.",Punch-Drunk Love
241,magic_marker,Not good. Not bad. Not even mediocre or OK.,8,28 July 2003,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" could best be described as ""other."" If ""Annie Hall"" is the ""Finnigan's Wake"" of cinematic romantic comedies, then ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a glass of orange juice. Or a brick. It exists entirely outside the parameters by which we judge films of this nature, and as such it is difficult to review it. The whole film is an essay in conflict. As an experience, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is alternately an assault on the senses and an transcendence of the mind. The groaning, hammering score is like the main character himself; grinding against its own melodic flow until it suddenly comes together in beautiful melodies. The wild, clashing colours that frequently invade the screen also, on occasion, suddenly resolve themselves into stunning, pastel creations so painterly they could be animated. Even the casting seems designed to engender awkwardness and uncertainty: pairing a foul-mouthed comedian known for juvenile humour and infantile rage (Adam Sandler) with one of the best and most versatile actresses alive (Emily Watson) was, if there truly is such a thing as chemistry, the recipe for a lab explosion. That the two work together is a testament to PT Anderson, who coaxes out of both his leads enough sympathy to each of the characters to allow their improbable attraction to proceed almost without question. The film works not as a romance (too distant) or as a comedy (too disturbing) but as an animate portrait of the soul of Sandler's character, Barry Egan. It is a graphic representation of the pain, humiliation and confusion with which he is flooded. In the film, Barry's soul takes the form of an abandoned harmonium; a burden he must lug from place to place, occasionally, tentitively plonking on it to see if he can make music, and only hearing the smallest, explosive whistle. Only when he takes it and drops it outside Watson's door does he begin to truly play it for all that it is worth.",Punch-Drunk Love

243,gga,Money down the drain,1,27 October 2002,"And I don't mean mine.  I mean the studio's.  It really drives me up the wall that someone such as Paul Thomas Anderson, who keeps proving more and more that he was a one trick pony with Boogie Nights, can get the financing to make as insipid movie such as this one.  As if that self congratulating piece of rubbish that was Magnolia had not been enough, he now brings us another one. In a year that has so far given us a string of terrible movies, the quirkiness and unpredictability of Punch-Drunk Love might seem like a breath of fresh air. Original, uncomfortable to watch (as was Boogie Nights) and unpredictable are indeed the biggest qualities of this film.  Alas, that does not make this a good film.  Not by the least. One of the problems is the two ridiculous plots that drive the movie: a love story that is so far fetched and unbelievable that makes even the worst romantic movie look good and an extortion scheme that absolutely goes nowhere and has no sense or purpose. However, it is the characters' personalities (the little of them that is there) that fare even worse. Somehow we are supposed to believe that a retarded man, prone to fits of anger, and played by Adam Sandler owns a business and has several employees. We are told he comes from a family of seven sisters (what for?  I don't know.  We only see them once and none of them really plays any important role in the movie, either).  We are also supposed to believe that Emily Watson (gorgeous and down to earth and with absolutely no personality in the script) not only will develop a crush at first sight after seeing a picture of him but she will also be desperate to initialize a relationship with him at all costs.  She also happens to be forgiving to the extreme, finds his insipid conversation charming and she is completely oblivious to the fact that this man she's trying to date is a retard and has serious personality disorders, including aggressive and compulsive behavior. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays against type here as the owner of a phone sex business and a somewhat mafioso want to be.  Could be a funny and charming character or even a threatening one, but even that goes to waste. Luiz Guzman seems to be the only actor that really gets the movie and who seems to be a representative of the audience.  Having basically no lines other than maybe asking some obvious questions that we are all asking (what's up with that piano?  what's up with puddings?  what's up with you and how come I work for you?), he just stares into the air every now and then with a face that seems to imply his recurring mantra of ""Sigh... I'm in a worse movie than even my occasional bad one, but if I keep repeating this to myself, it will soon be over"". And it is.   Unlike Magnolia that just kept going and going, this movie is still in the realm of the two-hour films. And two hours after it's done, you will hardly remember this film anymore.",Punch-Drunk Love
244,eddy_currents,For people who like movies that don't make sense,2,12 July 2003,"The opening scene makes no sense. Ok, I thought, maybe it's a dream, or fantasy, or hallucination, or something. That's okay if it fits in later. But it's never explained, nothing like it happens again, and something that comes out of it becomes a key prop in the movie. The opening scene simply doesn't belong.Then we find out our hero is a shy loser prone to psychotic episodes. That's okay too, maybe we will see him come out of his shell. But then a pretty, well-adjusted blonde who works with one of his bitchy sisters finds him attractive enough to ignore his anti-social tendencies and follow him around.Aha! This is what I've been doing wrong all these years! It's the pathetic nerds who break things and always wear the same clothes that get all the pretty girls!Oh yeah, he wears the same suit all the time. She doesn't mind getting intimate with him in spite of this, even when he spends two days in it in a tropical locale. Maybe she doesn't mind his body odor. Apparently she doesn't mind anything else repulsive about him.Then in several key scenes throught the movie, this jarring soundtrack plays. It's loud enough to obscure the dialogue. And it goes on, and on.Then I figured it out: some shy loser film student put this together to see his fantasy on screen, and suckered Sandler into starring in it, as his ""breakout role"".Our hero never really grows or changes. The lesson seems to be, if you are pathetic but occasionally violent you can still get a pretty girl.I have seen artsy movies done far better than this.

It's near the end of my freshman year, and I've been concentrating on finals and trying to bump on grades up and doing other hobbies other than movie reviewing. I found some time today to squeeze in one movie review. Over this period of time, I've been falling in love with the director Paul Thomas Anderson.Karsten Runquist mentioned his work in some of his YouTube videos, and I decided to check out his movies. The first Paul Thomas Anderson film I watched was Punch Drunk Love. It was on Netflix, and I had no idea what it was about. And watching it was a great experience. I'm not gonna get into any spoilers here because this movie is too good to spoil, but this is probably one of the most important films I've ever seen. It conveys so much truth about falling in love, and I think it is accurate. Before watching this film, I didn't take Adam Sandler very seriously. I thought he was a very lazy actor that didn't try to make his characters very special other than the humor. Adam Sandler has the best performance of his career in this film. His character feels so real and I feel everything he feels.The colors in this movie burst off the screen, and colors have a lot of symbolism in the film. The story flows like a stream, and the writing is just beautiful. I have to say that this film is flawless, in my opinion. I watched this film so many times, ever since the first viewing, which was a few months ago, and I can't let it go.

Perhaps 2002's best movie - and one of the best drama/romantic-comedies to ever hit the silver screen.PT Anderson is an absolute genius. A talented and master film-maker. Boogie Nights and Magnolia, two of Anderson's previous films, were absolutely stunning. Boogie Nights, in particular, was a complete masterpiece. And Punch-Drunk Love is no exception, another great piece of film-making by what is quickly becoming one of the world's top Directors. I can't wait for whatever he does next.Also, it's difficult to overstate the performance of Adam Sandler. I'm confident this will go down in history as his best work. Ironically, I thought I'd never see this movie because of Sandler starring in it. (I ONLY watched it because of my respect for PT Anderson - and I still waited 3 years to see it!). I enjoy most of Sandler's non-romantic comedies, but I couldn't even imagine him in a romantic movie, I thought he would be horrible. I couldn't have been more wrong. I wasn't prepared for such a great performance, as he stole the show from the opening scene. I can't remember ever being more surprised with the lead actor in a movie. He was simply great, a truly terrific performance.On the flip side, Emily Watson, as the caring Lena, was wonderful as well. I've got the feeling we will be seeing much more of her, as she had a breakout performance here in PDL. I thought at first that she almost looked too beautiful to put up with the antics of someone like Sandler's character (as she would be in high demand with the males), but then we see the quirky side of her as well, and it all comes together. Great touch.I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 25. If you're a teenager who's hoping for a few laughs from Sandler, you're going to be gravely disappointed. Buy the movie, store it in your closet, and pull it out when you reach 30 - and you'll love it! And please, don't let ""romantic comedy"" scare you (as it does me). I almost REFUSE to watch romantic comedies, but this one is much different. Romance and comedy surely aren't the first things that come to mind when I think of this film. It's a drama full of tension and embarrassment. It's an uplifting, yet shocking movie. To the intellectual mind, I can't recommend it enough.Thank you for reading!...JD",Punch-Drunk Love
250,forecastmazy,An emotional journey,9,1 September 2003,"This film is really amazing. I think I have to comment on it simply because of how amazing this film truly it. It has this sense and feel to it that really give you the idea that the director has a sense of his film and where hes sending the audience's emotions the entire time. Adam Sandler plays a very lonely mechanic. He answers phones, sells plundgers, actually we're never really sure what it is that Adam Sandler does besides it being bleak and sad. The movie begins with everything quiet and then a sudden car crash. Then a piano is dropped. Thats about a metaphor for the entire film.
The film has a very slow pace at first. It is very quiet and strange in this sense that only older films were able to capture. Then it suddenly merges itself into a perfect ball when Adam Sandler has an emotional outburst on his sister. It seems that, THAT moment has built up his anger inside of you. I found myself really cheering him on, jumping out of my seat, angry with his anger. The film is truly an amazing journey. Fans of cinema do indeed WATCH. However fans of Adam Sandler's slap-stick emotional nothingness may not enjoy it as much. Adam actually acts in this movie, instead of acting like the 'adam sandler' character he does in his comedy films. (Don't get me wrong, I'm a BIG fan of Sandler and all his work. BUT HE CAN ACT!

It shows a hidden acting talent that is obscured by his toothy, stupid Adam Sandler character of every other movie he has ever been in. The director of actors, Paul Thomas Anderson, brought this out from Sandler in an extremely personal and personable film. To put it simply, for Anderson, Barry Egan represents the eccentricity of himself and for everybody; he represents the difficulties, struggles, and awkwardness in everyday life.Anderson followed up what may be his greatest piece, Magnolia (1999), with an unusual romantic comedy. Yet he reached equal heights to his previous film. While Magnolia was a masterpiece of artistic vision, Punch-Drunk Love strikes at the heart of the everyday man. But to make a film that can touch everyone's heart is a monumental task. And Anderson succeeds.It follows the eccentric and struggling Barry Egan, played by Adam Sandler with exquisite taste, who manages a growing business, is abused by his family, struggles with anger problems, and searches for love, amidst the slightly strange, but uniquely pleasant events of the film. And every aspect of the film from the cinematography (which is abstract and brilliant) to the soundtrack (which incorporates the harpsichord that plays a prominent role in the film) contributes to the overall feel and development of the main character. His feelings come across from the basic facial features of Sandler and the carefully expressed twitches and mannerisms to the simple movement of the camera that translates to the screen. Loneliness. Anger. Sadness. Love. You feel it all. In the end, everybody feels some aspect of Egan in themselves and the people surrounding them.Anderson finishes his film with a unique, but appropriate climax that addresses all aspects of the main character's development in a satisfactory conclusion. His flourishes of the camera come together and accurately represent the emotions of himself and his characters, both throughout the film and in each individual scene. But an amazing aspect of the cinematic masterpiece is the sound and score. Music imbues more emotion than any other aspect of film and Anderson's implementation of his almost psychedelic and raw soundtrack perfectly complements the eccentricity of Egan.In the end, Anderson creates a personal masterpiece rather than an artistic masterpiece. It is one of the most overlooked, under- watched, and underrated films I know of and deserves more recognition and accolades than it received: a mere single Golden Globe nomination. It's personable and touching. It's funny, but serious. Barry Egan is us and we are him.",Punch-Drunk Love
253,jonnathanchavezz,cute date movie,10,19 September 2020,This movie is one of the best romantic comedies to be made ever and is just a pretty good feel good movie. the directing is some of the most unique in terms of this genre the characters are fun along with the performances behind them. this is adam sandlers best performance. fight me. the music is also another stand out of the movie the ranges from odd and base blasting to sweet on romantic. watch it with your boyfriend or girlfriend. or watch it alone if you don't have anyone. its still a good movie.,Punch-Drunk Love
254,iainwatson,Best 'cult' film since donnie darko,10,23 February 2003,"'Punch Drunk Love' is the newest release from Paul Thomas Anderson - the guy that brought us both Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson it's a very eccentric and bizarre romantic comedy where Barry (Sandler in his best performance), a lonely and frankly crazy small business owner, starts a unlikely romance with Lena (Watson) - a woman just mad enough herself to put up with his strange fits.I've always been a Sandler fan since seeing 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Billy Madison' (previously his best films IMO), but was starting to doubt his ability as an actor after seeing him going from top-drawer box-office smashes like 'The Wedding Singer' to junk like 'Little Nicky' and 'Mr Deeds'. By putting faith in Sandler, Anderson has shown us that he is truly one of the comic greats. Even though the film itself isn't strictly your standard ""comedy"", Sandler brings his early comedic flair to a strange and difficult role.A special mention however must be given to Phillip Seymour Hoffman - a brilliant performance from this underrated fast-rising actor. He gives his best performance to date, even with his limited screen time... even outshining his stint in Anderson's previous film, 'Magnolia'. With 'Love Liza' soon to start showning in the UK, I'm looking forward to seeing more of him on the big screen.My fave film since 'Donnie Darko', Punch Drunk Love definitely packs a fair wallop to the psyche with it's brilliant blend of strong fully-realised characterisation, eccentric script, amazing score, great directional flair, and beautifully artistic cinematography.",Punch-Drunk Love
255,Senator_Corleone,PTA unlocks Sandler with a brilliant film,10,11 April 2003,"We've come to expect a lot from Paul Thomas Anderson. After his twin masterpieces ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"", not to mention the sure-handed and satisfying ""Hard Eight"", we knew he was a filmmaker of skill and magic. So when it was announced that the next PTA film would be a 90-minute romantic comedy starring (Gasp!) Adam Sandler, I was, for one, not worried. This man had taken Mark Wahlberg and turned him into someone we could be proud to watch onscreen. He cast icon Tom Cruise, gave him the character of Frank ""T.J."" Mackey, and directed the actor to one of the most repulsive, offensive, and inspired performances of the ""Top Gun"" star's career. So, I was pretty confident in his ability to handle the star of ""Little Nicky"". But, boy, I still wasn't prepared for what I saw. Sandler just wasn't good, he was INCREDIBLE. I couldn't believe my eyes-here was the man behind ""Eight Crazy Nights"" creating a completely realized, utterly human character with a studied, nuanced performance. Many have commented on the fact that Barry Egan, Sandler's character, is not that different from his previous incarnations. Socially akward and prone to explosive violence, Barry might just be the key to explainging Sandler's Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. The character helps shine a light on the inner torment of those man-children.
The plot is a bit more complicated than your usual romantic-comedy fair. First off, it's really not a comedy. Second off, the two major players-Sandler and Emily Watson as the beautiful and mysterious Lena Leonard-both have quirks and tension that ordinary movie characters who fall in love don't in movies today. Barry has been terribly scarred (perhaps irreperably) by the constant torment and abuse of his seven sisters. There are several scenes where he bursts into destructive rages for no real reason-to sum it up, this guy has problems. Lena seems to have some of the same hurt simmering under her, but she controls it and accepts Barry for who he is, eventually coming to a stage where she understands him better than anyone truly ever has. Much of ""Punch-Drunk Love""'s story is how Egan manages to regain control of himself and experience truly human feelings for the first time. Lena is his salvation-through his devotion to her he saves himself.The film's other specifics are a bizarre, but extremely original mix of details. Barry is a toilet-plunger salesman. He one day wanders onto a loophole in a snack-foods sponsored contest that would allow him to get enough frequent flier miles to never have to pay for a plane ticket again. First, however, is the nasty business with a small-time porn entrepeneur in Utah who is trying to extort a large sum of money from Barry, using the company's ""Four Blonde Brothers"" to threaten the (for a time) hapless Egan. The film is so utterly free that to reveal how these disparate elements come together would ruin the movie. Much of the joy of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is that you never truly know where the movie is going to go next.
The performances are uniformly excellent. Philip Seymour Hoffman is ""the heavy"", but he puts a small line of tragedy in his character. Dean Trumbell seems fierce, but a telling look at his ""empire"" reveals he is all bark and no bite. The always-great Luis Guzman is Sandler's well-wishing co-worker, Lance, who is constantly supportive of Barry despite his doubts about what is really going on inside his boss's head. And Emily Watson is appropriately fascinating and quietly alluring as Lena, who drops her car off one day and admits the next she did it just to meet Barry.The film might seem weird and violent, but this is truly one of the sweetest movies I have seen at a long time. At its core, ""PDL"" is decent, honest, and beautiful. It is reminiscent of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", which, despite its rampant drug use and other disturbing subject matter, was a film that had a heart of gold. One of the best of 2002, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" will be seen in the future as a shining moment for all involved. Here's to hoping it will also be seen as the beginning of Adam Sandler's serious film career.",Punch-Drunk Love
256,jagfx,A wonderful new direction for Sandler and P.T. Anderson,9,19 October 2002,"I've seen a lot of negative comments for the wonderful ""Punch Drunk Love"", and I think a lot of this reaction is coming from the surprise of how un-Sandler *and* how un-Anderson this picture is. Indeed, it not just a departure for Adam Sandler but for P.T. Anderson as well.In his fourth feature, P.T. Anderson steps away from the ensemble-cast epicsthat brought him into the mainstream (""Boogie Nights"", ""Magnolia"") and the quiet character study of his debut ""Hard Eight"" (aka ""Sydney""). Instead, he takes a nod toward the romantic comedies of the forties' and fifties' and combines it with his own distinctive style to create a love story - and more specifically the study of a personality and of the actual ""falling"" in love. The madness of romance, rather than the whimsy.In ""Punch Drunk Love"", Sandler plays Barry Egan, a bi-polar, shy man who isconstantly belittled, and pushed around by his sisters. One morning he finds a harmonium on the driveway of his plunger business, as well as Lena (EmilyWatson) shortly thereafter leaving her car in his care for him to drop off at a neighbouring garage. When Lena returns to pick up the care, Barry finds himself falling for her and when she leaves on business trip to Hawaii, he follows her. In addition to all of this, Barry is being extorted by phone sex operators for money and carefully saving pudding cup barcodes in an insane plan to acquire airmiles. Does this sound crazy? Definitely, but in the wondrous hands of P.T.Anderson he pulls these seemingly disparate plot ends and ties them up before your eyes with constant surprises and an energy that is unflagging.Like his previous film ""Magnolia"", P.T. Anderson has a firm command of thesoundtrack for his film. Jon Brion's score hammers and clangs when it needs to and whispers and hints at others and the magical touch is the odd, but perfect, use of Shelley Duvall singing ""He Needs Me"" from Robert Altman's ""Popeye"". ""Punch Drunk Love"" is an absolutely gorgeous movie to look at. Shot in a rich, deep blue hue, with a beautiful wide screen lens, Anderson has a wide canvaswith which he creates some truly stunning scenes, particularly and curiously, in the supermarket sequences.Rounded out by a strong supporting cast, including Luis Guzman and PhilipSeymour Hoffman, ""Punch Drunk Love"" is one of the most touching and originalfilms this year. Be warned though, Adam Sandler and even P.T. Anderson fansmay be disappointed, but give it a chance and it will surprise you.9/10",Punch-Drunk Love

Stupid. Secondly, give him more than a fifth grader's IQ.  I can believe his anger, loneliness, sadness, but there was something disturbing and unbelievable about his near mild retardation. Thirdly, who in the world is this Nina and why?  What is this seemingly angelic and perfect woman's motivation for falling for this weirdo?  Because HE NEEDS HER...blah blah blah.  Couldn't believe it.  Just because she's an only child doesn't mean she's doomed to chase a borderline psychopath from a large family. Fourthly, Barry destroys a lot of glass in this film and his family is STILL curious as to why he wants psychological help? Fifthly, wicked sisters - that is the real story, and the surface of it was barely scratched.  Unfortunately, I know first-hand what domineering sisters can do to a boy (I'm one of those sisters). I like artsy-fartsy films, because I've had so many wonderful SATISFYING foreign/non-mainstream/independent film experiences, but this movie left me cold.

Adam Sandler's character was totally strange, and why would a girl like Emily Watson's character have the slightest interest in him other than just being horny.  I could sympathize with Barry Egan if his anger toward his meddling sisters was the main theme of the movie.  That should have been developed more. Now that's material for a good film.  But then all the other stupid crap:  the piano (harmonium, whatever it was), the pudding, a phone sex scam, and of course his lame business.

But if anything, it is a powerful demonstration of his true range, and a hint at the great works that are yet in his future.SNL actor Adam Sandler, meanwhile, really doesn't have that much range himself.  He is quite good when he's within his element though, apparently enough to garner Anderson's attention.  Having seen potential for greatness in Sandler, Anderson has taken the extraordinary risk of handcrafting a film specifically to showcase this unique talent, revolving it around a role that absolutely no one else could pull off.  The risk has paid off marvelously. This film shows Sandler at his quirky and lovable finest, extracting the best performance of his career (as Anderson's films invariably do!) while drawing us in with an odd - and oddly touching -  romance.

One way out, a liberator trip away on the Hawaii with a beautiful girl named Lena Leonard(a nice Emily Watson).

He really shines in this film, he is able to show Barry's vulnerabilities and rage really well. All the other performances are fantastic, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is the most memorable part of it. His part was not at all necessary or important, but he is masterful in his delivery. The romance was impressive and still paced perfectly. The chemistry was very nice to watch.

He starts off a great relationship, but his world starts to crumble around him when he refuses to lend a phone sex girl $750. Soon the boss of the phone sex company sends people to get him to pay up, but they are unaware of Barry's temper. This occasionally hilarious drama leaves you with a feeling inside you that you've never felt before.The acting is superb in this film. Adam Sandler is without a doubt the best actor of the year in a comedy. Emily Watson is terrific as Lena Leonard (Barry's girlfriend) as is Philip Seymour Hoffman (the leader of the phone sex company). But they cannot come close to Adam's performance in this. 'Punch-Drunk Love' was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson ('Boogie Nights', 'Magnolia') and he won at the Cannes Film Festival for Best Director. Anderson has done some of the most unique directing ever to be seen. Inter-cut between certain scenes, Anderson shows these weird, sometimes dizzying images that work terrific with the material. This is by far, the most unique directing since 'Mulholland Drive'.To tie it up, 'Punch-Drunk Love' will leave you dizzy, amazed and anxious to see Adam Sandler do more drama roles.

Still, it would be a shame for anybody who WOULD appreciate it to be deprived of it, and I wouldn't want to judge beforehand who that person might be.(By the way, here's a note to those who are overly concerned with determining why Lena is attracted to Barry: Bear in mind that, with very few exceptions, all of the events of the film are given to us from Barry's perspective. Perhaps leaving us in the dark about Lena's motivations is merely to reflect Barry's misgivings about the same thing.

The film gives us a glimpse of the life of Barry Egan (Sandler) and it isn't very pretty.  He is constantly harassed by his seven sisters; he has no one he can really talk to or trust.  In his loneliness he calls a phone sex line, an action that has long-reaching consequences.  He also meets an attractive young woman (Emily Watson) and begins a relationship with her.
Egan is a man beset by problems of all kinds but we see no sign of or hope for resolution.  Watson's Lena Leonard is not so much a mysterious character as a non-entity.  We never know her, learn next to nothing about her except that she is an only child and there is no real interpersonal relationship between the two, only a seeming mutual attraction.While you are watching it, the film is interesting enough to pass the time and the direction is unusual and quirky, but the lack of involvement with and between the main characters leaves the viewer feeling uninvolved as well.",Punch-Drunk Love

This time, I wasn't so surprised about a generally mediocre actor (Sandler) starring in an 'art' film, instead I was pleasantly surprised by how one of the director's previous titles managed to surpass his most recent work. 'Punch-Drunk Love' is another unusually captivating masterpiece that manages to feel fresh and exciting despite following the conventions of a ""quirky"" formula recurring in these types of films.One of those conventions is the psychologically troubled protagonist, this time portrayed by Adam Sandler who genuinely accelerates in the role, with a handful of mostly negative as well as positive encounters as the wonderfully engaging character of Barry Egan. In addition to this, the whole experience of the film is made even more compelling through intriguing visuals and a vastly elaborate soundtrack switching from abrupt and monotone to melodic and charming. In general, the constantly switching tone of the film succeeds every time it does so, whether it attempts comedy or suspense it handles each genre excellently.Each actor pulls off a phenomenal performance, fitting into the light-hearted yet profound feel of the film - Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance for example, although brief, was executed perfectly. In fact, all of the interactions between Sandler, Emily Watson and all the other actors were highly memorable and undoubtedly struck a chord with me.

Despite being clueless, obsessive, and under-achieving and exhibiting stalker-like behavior (following his love object to Hawaii when he hardly knows her?), Adam Sandler's character somehow manages to win the heart of Emily Watson's pretty, sweet, emotionally stable character.She sticks with him despite his making blunders that would doom the chances of any man who tried them in real life. The last stunt he pulls--running off to act on a trivial, self-absorbed impulse and leaving her injured in the emergency room--would have definitely ended the relationship for any woman who had any self-respect.

Just not enough of them for me to suspend the amount of belief necessary to wholeheartedly endorse this movie.Emily Watson plays an earth-mother with more compassion than physically possible to Adam Sandler's cracked psyche.  I buy the premise that growing up as the only boy in a family with seven sisters would make you a little, well,  damaged.  But Sandler's emoting would get him locked up in most of the United States.  And really, if it wasn't Adam Sandler in the part and PT Anderson as the director, would anyone have green-lighted the project and stirred up the dreaded ""Oscar buzz?""

The film is a slow and intricate character study of a psychologically troubled Barry Egan, who is played by Adam Sandler. Adam Sandler does an exceptional job portraying an emotionally volatile yet charming character, who has so much emotional depth. Emily Watson also does a phenomenal job playing Lena Leonard, Barry Egan's love interest. An awkward romantic, Lena Leonard combats Barry's emotional issues, and slowly become's romantically involved with Barry. The on-screen chemistry between Emily Watson & Adam Sandler is indisputable.The use of colour throughout Punch-Drunk Love is ingenious, and the art direction throughout is so innovative, with incredible visuals from start to finish. The colours have such a dominant role, and even help when distinguishing mood in a shot. The colour plays a massive role in the narrative and goes against all film norms. The lighting and cinematography are both excellent and constantly remind the audience of Barry Egan's high temper. Paul Thomas Anderson's innovative cinematography consists of bizarre angles, tricky shots and remarkably well-shot camera movements. Paul Thomas Anderson's use of the score/soundtrack to create tension was unbelievable.The film is a sweet unconventional romantic comedy, Lena Leonard accepts Barry Egan for who he is, and his difficulty gaining control over himself. The film is so utterly unpredictable it keeps you at the edge of the seat throughout, with subplots that develop these complex characters so well. The film is a technical feat and solidifies Paul Thomas Anderson as one of the best directors around. As an audience, we get to take a step into the poetry of Punch-Drunk Love. A masterpiece by all means. A truly courageous and passionate film.",Punch-Drunk Love
279,anthony_ian,"If You're a PTA Fan, It's More of His Genius",10,23 August 2003,"This is a trademark PTA film--everything from the stunning camera work (check out how most of it is using natural light) to the inexplicable events (what's with the SUV crash in the beginning, LOL?) to the appearance of Luiz Guzman in a major role.I never took Adam Sandler seriously until I saw this.  It's an old adage that comedy guys can always do ""straight,"" while the opposite isn't necessarily true.  Sandler proves it here.Many Sandler fans didn't ""get"" this film, and that's no surprise.  And probably a huge compliment.Overall, I'd rank it #2 behind Boogie Nights, a little more likeable than Magnolia (although that was genius, too).Things to enjoy about the film on first viewing:-Notice the long sequences where there is no music -Notice the naturally lit shots everywhere--there's a scene in a parking lot with Sandler and Emily Watson where there's a lens flare going on the whole time! -Notice the constant appearance of a moving van -If you see this on DVD, you HAVE to check out the ""commercial"" for the mattress place which was filmed but never used, containing a scary accident which luckily didn't seriously injure Phillip Seymour Hoffman (caught on film!)Enjoy!",Punch-Drunk Love

Paul Thomas Anderson remind us it is NOT, thanks to this spectacular movie. Adam Sandler simply deserves the Academy Award Nomination for his role, and hopefull will get the Golden Globe for sure.

I ADMIRED Magnolia - a mess that almost clicked. But this? Talk about undeveloped female characters. They're either one dimensional whining jerks (his sisters) or non-existent (the wonderful Emily Watson.) Why did she fall for Sandler's character, other than because the writer wrote it that way? My girlfriend and I didn't buy it for a second. And for all these reviewers who are waxing poetic about what a wonderful change of pace, original movie this is -- how about the contrived ending? Gimme a break. This movie might have worked for me if Watson had a character -- who DIDN'T accept psycho Sandler in the end. Maybe if she helped him get the therapy he so desperately needed I could have walked out saying, ""Wow - now THAT'S an original love story."" I won't even get into the annoying, pretentious music and those pretty yet pretentious rainbow color things that kept fading in and out for no reason.

People say this is a ""deep"" movie, but in all honesty who cares about symbolism and deeper meanings. When i pay money to see a movie i want to be entertained, and this wasnt entertaining.A lot of people who have written reviews about this movie criticize the people who did not like this movie because they are ""stupid"" and cannot comprehend the ""deeper"" meaning to the movie. Maybe they just like Adam Sandler doing what he does best - making retarded jokes and acting like a jackass. Maybe the people who like movies that involve absolutely no higher level activity are tired of thinking because they have careers where they use their brain all day long, not like some wanna-be artsy film critic in college who slams everyone for liking films that are ""dumb"".If critics cannot understand a movie, they give it a good review because they are scared they will look stupid if the other critics claim to ""understand"" it.

Even though many of his fans were disappointed in his last movie, magnolia, I loved it. People were expecting something else. The length of the film was the biggedt problem. But this is a 90-minute masterpiece. As soon as the film began, I was hooked. Even though I was nevous that Adam Sandler would pull a Jim Carrey and go into serious films just to get the oscar, I thought he would be good. He wasn't good...he was great. The casting of Adam Sandler was genius. And having him wear the same suit throughout the whole film is equally genius. If you like situations that seem to be unthinkable but yet are totally real at the same time then you will like this movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman made me laugh so hard I thought I was going to die. The direction is fantastic. Camera angles and camera movements in this movie are unlike anything that I have ever seen. P.T. Anderson should get an oscar for his beautiful images. All I can do is hope that the academy is not too stuck up to give it to him.

285,twm-2,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" a revelation for those who dislike Adam Sandler",9,19 January 2005,"I am not an Adam Sandler fan. When you mix moronic with hostility you produce something like, well, like Adam Sandler--it ain't pretty, and, more importantly, it ain't entertaining. But that's just me. I HAVE seen a few of his earlier movies and the experience was like that sweet sound of long, sharpened fingernails being raked over a blackboard (sometimes the experience was so bad it felt as if they were being raked over my juggler). There were a few moments when I thought I might have glimpsed something different, something almost human in his face, but then there'd be that idiot voice, or some wildly exaggerated mannerism--supposedly humorous, but actually cringe inducing--to reaffirm my antipathy. BUT, then I saw a trailer for Punch-Drunk Love, and-- what was this? a movie with A.S. and Emily WATSON?--that most excellent actress from Breaking the Waves? What was SHE doing in a . . . And that director? Wasn't he the one who did Boogie Nights? So, natch, I had to see this movie. I was curious. . . . But soon I was mesmerized.Many Adam Sandler (AS) fans have lamented his radical departure from the kind of films he has done before--an entirely understandable reaction. None of us likes to see that which we love radically changed. People who love the glitz and neon of Las Vegas would reasonably be peeved to find that it had been razed, and a forest planted to take its place. It would be futile to attempt to prove to hard-core AS fans that this is a good film. How can you convince someone that something they don't like is something they should like? I know beets are good for you. I know that some people LOVE beets. I still hate beets. It's regrettable. It's too bad. My beet animus remains. I LOVE Punch-Drunk Love(PDL). **MILD SPOILERS** I love it for all the myriad odd details--the harmonium that is dropped off in the middle of the street for reasons entirely unknown, AS's method of accumulating zillion's of Sky Miles--but then doesn't get to use them. I love it for a plot that is SUNNY in spite of ink-sodden clouds rumbling ominously all around, a plot that clearly originated outside the Hollywood cookie/plot-cutter factory--totally impossible to predict. I loved it for that odd little romance (yes, I admit it. Emily Watson's immediate interest in AS was a weakness in the film. I could see how she could fall for him over time, but how could her first impression have been anything but negative?). I loved the overall arc of the film--AS, insecure, sad, with occasional bouts of unfocused, psychotic rage (here, reasonably explained, unlike in AS's past {reputed} comedies), transformed by love into someone who could take that boiling-over-anger and turn it into a powerful directed force for good (that scene with the blonde brothers ramming AS's car was wonderfully cathartic. As soon as he saw that trickle of blood running down Watson's face, he was transfigured. His protective instincts for this person he cared for transformed his rage into a calm fearsome purpose). I loved it for Watson's luminous presence. Most of all, I loved it for Adam Sandler (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). Excised from the slavery of less than mediocre cinema, his wildly exaggerated mannerisms were given reason, and he was suddenly nuanced, subtle, even human. It was a pleasure to see him act, to watch his emotional turmoil play out on his face, to be drawn in, to empathize . . . with Adam Sandler? Now THAT is movie magic. I'm not ready for AS to elbow his way onto my list of favorite living actors, much less supplant Paul Newman from his lofty perch on the top rung, but I find myself looking forward to Spanglish.

If I had not been with a friend when watching it, I would have fallen asleep at 8:30 in the evening, and not woke up until, well, who knows when? I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I am surprised anyone could justify the expense of making it. On the other hand, my friend said that he enjoyed it, perhaps I ""just don't understand?"" I could sum up what I think about this film in one word: ""lame."" I don't understand why Sandler's character spent MORE to get his frequent flier miles than he had to - if he had bought the $1.79 items instead of the $2.** items, he would have got as many miles but spent less to get them. An interesting hi-light was ""the brothers,"" who appear actually to have been portrayed by actual brothers, or at least relatives. And what the heck was the point of the keyboard? Nobody seems to have known what to call it, I don't even know what it was. It sounded like an accordian. Finally, how did that car or truck fly up into the air and blow up near the beginning of the film? It really went nowhere in a big hurry. I just didn't understand.

This love, in turn, results in a metamorphosis that turns our wimp into a brave hero who finally has direction in his life.This movie should have been 15 minutes, perhaps 30 minutes tops, and not 95 minutes.  I'd rather be watching infomercials between scenes.For example, the phone sex scene was completely worthless - it is not funny unless you have the mind of a 14 year-old.  It adds nothing at all to the story.  The director drags this whole phone-sex idea all over the place, scene after scene, just to show in the end that the hero is able to stand up for himself against the villains, and yet the villains were flat under-developed characters with no individuality.  The villains might as well be a pack of mean dogs that attack Adam Sandler and Emily Watson in the car.Too much icing, not enough cake.The artsy-fartsy plot deserves a 9/10, but because it was diluted with meaningless scenes encompassing more than two-thirds the movie, I give it a 5/10.",Punch-Drunk Love
288,hrivnak,Great character study,10,28 October 2002,"First, I would like to note that I have never seen a PT Anderson film I actually liked, until I saw ""Punch-Drunk Love."" I hated ""Hard Eight"" and ""Magnolia,"" thought both were pretentious loads of cr*p. I hated them so much, I refused to watch ""Boogie Nights"" even though everybody seems to praise it. I think I'll check it out now.Unbelievably, this movie shows that Adam Sandler can act, and act well. I love his incredible stupid roles in ""Billy Madison"" and ""Happy Gilmore,"" but he actually shows great range in ""Punch-Drunk Love."" The way he moved back and forth between being pathetic to full of rage was awesome, and he really made you feel for a character that is pretty absurd. He made Barry Egan a believable and sympathetic character.And to top it off, Philip Seymour Hoffman, plays a great foil to Sandler. The scene where the two confront each other over the phone is just incredible. PSH does so much with just one line of dialogue in that scene... he's just incredible.As for PT Anderson, well... he may still be pretentious, but I love what he did with the camera in this film. Robert Elswit deserves special mention for his use of practical lighting and intentional lens flares that really added to the realism of an often fantastical story.As hard as it is for me to believe, I actually think PT Anderson has made the best film so far this year.",Punch-Drunk Love

It caught my interest all of three times: When Sandler saw the car wreck and the harmonium was dropped off, when he landed in Hawaii (I recognized the airport), and when he was attacked the second time.Other than that, the movie was boring, pointless, and FAR from being the director's best effort. I'm not a big fan of the director anyway, but this was just putrid. I can't understand the glowing reviews, and I am a film fan. I think the ratings are pretty much riding on his reputation, similar to the way Scorsese's have been ever since Goodfellas.",Punch-Drunk Love
290,Vinicius8,My youth romantic comedy is wrong as I expected.,8,11 May 2021,"Punch-Drunk Love resembles a common rom-com, but all of its narrative beats are out of synch. But not by much, so it keeps you invested. It's a story you know very well, but it is presented in a way that makes you question your ability to predict what will happen next.Every scene is accompanied by a uneasy feeling, a twinge of discomfort, even when it is making you laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. Or rather, the absurdity of the characters actions. Most of the actual narrative is tradicional, but it is in how Anderson's characters navigate through this ordeal that the genius of Punch-Drunk Love shines through.Punch-Drunk Love somewhat reminded me of the Eric Andre Show, and oh boy, I love it. It is fun. It is riveting. It is complex. It is agonizing. It is absurd. It is satisfying. And it is damn well worth it.",Punch-Drunk Love

It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the story is pointless. There are two subplots-- the romance between Barry and Lena, and the trouble Barry gets into because of his call to a phone-sex line--but they don't really come together. The filmmaker doesn't seem to know what he wanted the movie to be--a comedy, a drama or a combination. And because he didn't know what he wanted, the film doesn't work on any of these levels. There is zero chemistry between Barry and Lena, so it is never clear what this attractive and successful woman sees in this strange, child-like man. All in all, it's a very unsatisfying movie. It just kind of meanders along without really going anywhere. The only redeeming quality is the acting--it was great to see Adam Sandler in a role that is very different from his usual comedies.",Punch-Drunk Love

If it had not been for the fact that it was free and I was with friends and there was nothing on the TV, I would have left (as some others did in the cinema). This film was worse than the Flintstones and Popeye movies. A lot of the film made no sense and was not explained, e.g. the issues with his sisters, cakes, smashing things up, the organ and the suit?. I can understand the crying issue as this is what most people who saw the film wanted to do. You were only given basic explanations for the plot. There was a lot of nervous laughter in the cinema, so I was not sure if it was just me who thought the film was bizarre. Once it finished though, I realised everyone had the same opinion. I have seen many strange films in the past (including oriental ghost stories which were still very entertaining), but this film fails to entertain.",Punch-Drunk Love
293,Jen_UK,"Crazy, Lilting, Hypnotic, Bizarre ... and BRILLIANT!",9,26 November 2003,"Paul Thomas Anderson is nothing short of an absolute genius. An auteur of the rarest gifts and he has proven it yet again in this mesmerising, understated little gem of a film - easily (and infuriatingly) one of the most underrated pictures of last year. It doesn't have the ostentatiousness or the length of MAGNOLIA. And it doesn't have the bold brashness of BOOGIE NIGHTS (both of which I ADORED too!) But Punch-Drunk Love is wonderful. And PTA has proven his versatility as a director.Like all art, this will divide its audiences. As a bizarre take on the Romantic Comedy genre, PDL is about as surreal as it gets whilst still managing to have its own warped sense of reality. It's a slow, ponderous yet engaging film which hooks you in and leaves you unnable to explain the power it commands.I would do a disservice to the magic of the film by giving too much away to those of you who may not have seen it. All I am left with after a second viewing is a beautifully subdued tone, some painstakingly composed images, a gently sweet and fitting score and lush colours. The screenplay is in equal parts moving and darkly comic.I wonder if the film's main strength (aside from the razor sharp direction) is to be found in the casting. Adam Sandler. All I can say is who would have thought it? In customary style, PTA has taken the most unlikely actor one can conjour up and extracted a majestic performance from him. As Barry Egan he is simply brilliant - never losing his grip on the potential for extreme sadness that lies underneath this apparent figure of fun, and social reject. Emily Watson is perhaps one of the finest actresses working today. As Lena she is off the scale endearing and at the same time mysterious and aloof. One oscillates from wanting to cuddle and protect her, and being slightly scared. I only wish her character had been fleshed out a little more, but I understand why this wasn't necessary in the surreal world of PDL.As for the symbolism of the harmonium, the colours, the costumes? ... I'm still trying to figure those ones out. And that is why I love this film so much. It engages your brain and doesn't shout it's meanings out at you like 90% of contemporary Hollywood. Bravo, Paul Thomas Anderson! I applaud this masterpiece to a deafening scale!",Punch-Drunk Love

In 'Punch-Drunk Love'  you get to see a new version of the guirky Sandler character....  except this time you are a little afraid of this guy...  you feel like at  any moment, he's gonna loose it.  Sandler is phenominal this time out....  he  really draws you into his character and your genuinely want him to succeed. As for the rest of the film...  I was uncomfortable through much of the first half, but  this is a good thing as it makes me sympathize.  As the story evolves, I found my  self enthralled with what was going to happen next.

Is it the fact that parts of the movie are strung together with this weird kaleidoscope effect, which makes only the slightest of sense? Am I supposed to be impressed by bright colors having no place in a sequence of shots? In the confusion of the characters movements, Punch Drunk Love wants you to think that it's telling you something important. `Here I am, trying to be strange and darkly funny and because it doesn't work all that well, your going to like me.' Not this criticPunch Drunk Love falls victim to it's own characters, which becomes the main flaw. At first, Adam Sandler's character Barry is so intriguing with the way he acts and moves, but after about 20 minutes, you find yourself plotting exactly what he's going to do next! It becomes overly repetitive and predictable. Emily Watson mumbles her lines through almost all of her scenes, and I'm supposed to think, `I can't understand what she's saying, therefore it must be smart!' No! It's movies like this that are meant to brainwash other viewers into thinking they're watching a masterpiece, when it fact, they're watching a bunch of fluff strung together.What exactly was Paul Anderson aiming for with this one? Eccentric characters with troubled lives? It almost seemed as if he was mixing Tom Cruise's Vanilla Sky depression ridden main characters with Wes Anderson's dark comedy and eccentricity. Except, here's the problem. Vanilla Sky was awful and no one can touch Wes Anderson! Wes Anderson is an amazing director with a vision a bit clearer than Paul's. And this kaleidoscope effect? A David Lynch-type move that found itself out of place in trying to woo an audience into thinking it was being clever.Worth a look for some funny parts, but not worth the 9 bucks to go to the theatre.

Now I loved Boogie Nights and i liked Magnolia but this one - I dunno.The direction is good - Anderson knows to frame a shot and how to mix his palette but after 24 hours I'm still kinda lost as to what it was about or more importantly what it was trying to say. Sure Anderson is quirky but this thankfully short moral play never seems to get going and is bogged down by his stylictic flourishes and slow narrative.The central Character played By Sandler raises so many questions - How did he ever start a business - how does he sustain it - is he mentally ill - does he have a disorder - how has he got through life without being locked up? I could go on forever - and i know its a movie and we are supposed to suspend our belief - but this character never rings true for me and brings me out of the movie on so movie occasions. It feels like a wee overblown piece of Magnolia blown into a short movie - but nevertheless has its moments. I liked him getting back at the blonde brothers and the store owner but again there's no build up to this. Overall a 6 - cause like I say I just dunno!!!!!!!!!,Punch-Drunk Love

In short, a train wreck of a movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
299,BenjCarr,One of the best films of the year.,10,29 October 2002,"On Saturday, I saw one of the most obscure, bizarre, different and ultimately conventional and rewarding films, and I have to recommend it to all of you. It's the Adam Sandler-Paul Thomas Anderson movie, PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE.
Usually, with Adam Sandler, I'm on the fence. I remember him from when he was on REMOTE CONTROL when I was 12. I remember him when he started on SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, and I loved his skit there called THE DENISE SHOW, where a dumped, depressed guy uses a cable access program as an excuse to stalk his ex-girlfriend. P.T. Anderson, I noticed from interviews, remembered Sandler from THE DENISE SHOW, too, and made this movie with the complexities and sadness that character in mind.All the rage (not range) that Sandler showed in films like THE WEDDING SINGER, which at times was smart and good, or THE WATERBOY, which at times was dumb and good, is on display in PUNCH-DRUNK, but Sandler's character, Barry Egan, is more awkward than goofy. He's shy, damaged, browbeaten. In his words, he ""doesn't like himself very much sometimes.""In the role, Sandler's able to maintain his character's oddness, manic temper (complete with fits of violence) and essential goodness, generating sympathy and care even when he does things like call a phone-sex line or destroy a restaurant bathroom.As I've watched more Paul Thomas Anderson films in an attempt to better understand them (for MAGNOLIA frequently left me baffled and confused), I've come to appreciate some recurring elements: twists of fate that inject magic into everyday life, characters that exist only to forgive and love the damaged characters and random, off-the-wall dialogue and plot twists.PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE has these. Its hokiness, for it is a somewhat-formula romantic comedy, is redeemed by these elements. Lena Leonard, played by Emily Watson, is the character whose sole purpose in the film is to unconditionally love Barry Egan. The character isn't as clearly defined or quirky as Sandler's because she exists for a sole purpose, to save Egan from himself, to teach him how to hold relationships with others, to trust others, because she almost instinctively understands that he's been hurt a lot and hasn't really deserved it.
The arrival of Leonard in Barry's life coincides with the arrival, as well, of a harmonium on his doorstep. The harmonium, one of those air-organ type instruments, shows up by complete chance, and its arrival, strangely, initially frightens Barry. Yet, as he comes to accept it and learns how to play it, everything else in Barry's life comes into order.I loved this movie so much that I wanted to give it a hug. It's not laugh-out-loud funny. It probably won't appeal to a lot of people. Some people may find it too off-the-wall. Others may just not get it.But I embrace any film that understands its themes clearly, knows what it's trying to say and says just that. I don't even mind a happy ending if a film earns it.Through accepting that goodness and magic does occur in the world and that the world isn't all hurt, Barry Egan is able to accept that there is goodness inside him and that he deserves love. I thought that was pretty great.So see it.",Punch-Drunk Love

I decided to hang on and stay with it to see if it would develop. IT DID!! The best word to describe this film is ""quirky"". I have seen almost every movie Adam Sandler has done, and I think this is his best by far!! The story line is very eccentric but it also works. I found myself laughing at some points and almost in shock at others. It will keep you guessing as to what will happen next. I don't want to give anything away and I won't, but if you start to watch this film and think it is gonna suck, persevere, because it doesn't! The story takes a little time to develop, and the style is somewhat eclectic, but I really ended up enjoying this film -- a lot!! I think Sandler is only so-so as an actor, as his pictures tend to be really good or really bad. This one is in a league of it's own and I think it is his best film to date. He can act--when he wants to--that much is obvious. I hope he does more movies as good as Punch Drunk Love, and please Adam, no more Waterboys or Little Nickys!! 8 out of 10.",Punch-Drunk Love

I do have a clue as to why it was praised, but I just don't agree.I'll give it some points for being original and different. You don't quite know where it's going to go, and that's a good thing. I did find Sandler's character somewhat interesting. But there seems to be this school of thought nowadays among the critics and the art film crowd that as long as you put something on the screen that defies the standard conventions then you've made a great film.Well, I'm 100% for defying the predictable conventions. But it just isn't enough. You've also got to have a story. A movie should make some kind of statement; it should say something. It should mean something. That's where Punch Drunk Love fails.I took some ribbing from friends for giving an Adam Sandler movie a chance. In general a typical Adam Sandler movie would be something I wouldn't be caught dead watching. But this is no typical silly ""Adam Sandler movie"". In fact I thought Sandler did a rather good acting job. It's a bad movie simply because it's empty of meaningful content.",Punch-Drunk Love

It's the classic redemption plot, just across like eight characters instead of one. Eight boring characters (ok, the cop was kind of amusing), each one suffering from overacting.  And it was LONNNNNGG, sprawling and full of garbage time.I knew I was in for something at least decent with Punch Drunk Love.  A quick glance at the DVD case indicated it was a 95 minute movie.  From this writer/director, that in itself was enough to pique my curiosity.  Then, as it unfolded, I realized that this whole thing was a two-character movie (really one and a half, as Emily Watson's character is far less dealt with than Sandler).  It's just a funny, quirky movie about one lonely, misunderstood guy and his means of finding his ""fit"" in life.  All of his unexplainable ""freak-outs,"" his loneliness, his mild dishonesty; they all find a resolution in this gem.The soundtrack is annoying, but that is its purpose, so I'll let that slide. The film is beautifully shot in the San Fernando Valley (and Waikiki).Recommended, particularly if you felt let down by the length of the PTA's other two movies.",Punch-Drunk Love
305,speedny7,Where's Sandler's Oscar?,10,26 April 2003,"Adam Sandler absolutely stole the show in ""Punch-Drunk Love"", which is one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time.  As small business owner Barry Egan, Sandler displayed more emotion than any character in recent history. I think Sandler deserved an Oscar, or at least a nomination, for his performance.  Once again, the Academy shows its disrespect for comedies by not giving the film a single nomination.  Hell, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is the best original screenplay of last year, by far.  Anyway, I would recommend that everyone see this movie.  But I'm warning you- its an intelligent movie, so typical Sandler fans might be disappointed after seeing it.",Punch-Drunk Love
306,eshaines,I'm Punch-Drunk for Mr. Sandler,8,20 April 2014,"Okay: 8 out of 10 is pretty good for me. I am picky when it comes to ALL kinds of consumption: from films to groceries.If you've ever read any of my reviews, you know I pay attention to two things other reviewers tend to ignore: graphic design in the film and titles, and soundtrack. First of all, the soundtrack was, to me, a bit melodramatic; almost like the EQ of the film was turned up too high, and as though it belonged in some silent film of a bygone era. In associating this melodrama with the soundtrack, the filmmaker obviously wanted to punctuate the theatricality of the plot and characters: Barry's sisters are, from what the viewers can observe, entirely tedious and oppressive to poor Barry, interrupting him at work to set him up on dates and ask about his attendance to a family gathering, and paying little attention to his emotional turmoil, commitments, or needs as their brother; Barry himself is highly eccentric, punching up public bathroom stalls when he feels pangs of anger, asking his dentist brother-in-law if he can help him since he ""is a doctor"" and since Barry doesn't ""like himself"" and ""cries"" sometimes, traveling all the way to Hawaii to escape his violent stalkers and be with his newly acquired girlfriend, and buying all the Healthy Choice products he can just to receive vast amounts of airline mileage in return. Sandler's character is a bit unpredictable in terms of his tendency to blow up into physical violence, and also because of certain nuances of his personality that just don't fit in with that violent persona (e.g., his pseudo-tap dance in the grocery store aisles when he is about to buy enough pudding to take him around the world—where did his anxiety and fear for his life escape to in these moments?), but over the course of the film, that unpredictability becomes a part of his charm and appeal. a particularly unique example of this occurs when the two protagonists are in Hawaii, kissing. they stop just long enough to exchange the following words:Lena: Your face is so adorable and your skin and your cheek and I want to bite it...I want to bite your cheek and chew on it, it's so f*cking cute Barry: I'm looking at your face and I just wanna smash it... I just wanna f*cking...smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it, you're so pretty Lena: I wanna chew on your face and I want to scoop out your eyes and I want to eat them and chew them and suck on them Barry: Okay. This is funny... This is nice.A number of other idiosyncratic moments happen during the course of the film.such as when Barry, mid-explanation to his coworker of the violent situation that has befallen him, looks at his stacks of airline mileage pudding and says absent-mindedly under his breath, ""I need to get more pudding."" It is quirks like these which cement Anderson's reputation as that of a unique auteur in film history.Also, what a pleasant surprise to see the likes of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in this film. His tragic death is punctuated by the rarity of his talent, as evidenced by his brief--but potent-- performance in Punch-Drunk Love.I am a little inconclusive about the splicing of scenes with the psychedelic, Summer-of-Love- esque color animations. Is Anderson trying to underscore the latent madness in Barry, our main character, which eventually escalates to a point of justified self defense? Does it serve as a foreshadowing of the ""punch-drunk"" love between Lena and Barry that leads him to finally take a stand for himself against his and her attackers? Was Anderson just enamored with pretty colors when he wrote this screenplay? Or are we to think the whole film is so inherently fictitious that this is all more like a dream sequence (think Wayne's World dream sequences) than actual reproducible reality? The characters are a bit ""out there,"" but I think the events of the film are highly possible in an objective , director-less, realistic world. The moral of the story: never give out your social security number to a phone sex operator who you've also given your credit card number, name, address, and the fact that you are worth x amount of dollars, unless you want to get stalked and attacked by the able-bodied brothers of that same crazy woman from Provo, Utah, who calls herself ""Georgia Peach"" and refuses to take no for an answer when she asks you to pay her $750 rent. and don't break stuff just because you're mad-- 'cause love's just around the corner...",Punch-Drunk Love
307,lovepade,A Perfect film from Paul Thomas Anderson,9,27 January 2003,"The title of this memorable film hints to violence and abuse, and behind it all a pattern of lifesaving love. And so it is, only in a very peculiar kind of way.It is by no means a big' movie P.T. Anderson has made; on the contrary this flick is subtle and silent, poetic and attentive.The Protagonist, for once played extremely well by Adam Sandler, is a sort of anti-hero, trapped in shyness and confusion, most likely connected to his seven-sister large family pulling him in directions he does not wish to go. We are unsure of his sexuality, but as the story unfolds it really doesn't matter. All that matters is that a woman enters his life and turns it around.The woman, as always acted superbly well by Emily Watson, has all the love that is needed to turn our anti-hero life around.So the story is simple: Confused man meets girl, and everything changes.P.T. Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) is well in charge here. The pictures captures the life of the main characters; clear-cut, yet confused and claustrophobic. Notice the scene in the mall were Adam Sandler apparently is all alone surrounded by clear sharp artificial' colours, shot with a fish eye lens so that the room sort of closes in on him. Then compare this to the scene in Hawaii were the two main characters meet again: They are completely alone, but the instant they meet, the place gets crowded and they blend in. The colours are natural and the space is open to the sea that can be seen in the background. When I saw that scene it reminded me of Sandler saying how he didn't like people starring at him, in the beginning of the film.And while I go on and on about the beauty of this film, I tend to forget all the suspense and action that is actually here, and which underlines the point of the movie. The violence is here for a reason, not purely aesthetics. (But notice this: This is not an action movie - is a poetic dream with humour and lots of patience, mixed well with suspense!)
And it's nice for once to see a movie not afraid of lasting only 1½hours. Not a minute to long, not a minute to short. A perfect film from P.T. Anderson. 9/10",Punch-Drunk Love
308,najania,celebration of the coarse and crass,4,13 April 2011,"This film was recommended to my daughter by a budding film director, but I must say I saw little in it to recommend to anyone else, except for the cinematography and use of color, which seemed vaguely French to me. I suppose that is the ""artsy"" component - along with the symbolism of the broken harmonium, etc. But let's not make too much of this dressing. The story is ludicrous, and how anyone could find anything ingratiating or sympathetic about any of the characters is beyond me. Perhaps I have been out of the States for too long, but Barry - in both his behavior and his language - struck me as just plain repugnant - as, indeed, almost everyone else in the story is, with the possible exception of Lena, who is merely daffy. Lucky her. Sociologically enlightening for its celebration of dysfunction, foul mouths, and general boorishness.

the main plot of the movie was weak.  the main character was more annoying than interesting as were most of the supporting characters.  the saving grace of the story was the phone sex/extortion plot and the pudding scam.but what really KILLED this movie was the film making.  i am not sure if the director was attempting to create a state of confusion or was just trying to do something 'artsy' but it really started the movie off bad. instead of using his 'directorial skills' to enhance the telling of the story, it seemed instead that the story was secondary to 'look at this abnormal camera angle' or 'wow a car just came rolling by..how radical'.  the dialog was also a little bit too 'edgy'.

I was blown away by Adam Sandler's performance.  When I first heard about a new P.T. Anderson film, I was so excited.  When I heard he had cast Sandler as the leading man, I was gravely disappointed but kept the faith (if he can make Heather Graham look good...).  He took a chance, but once it was released, we were all let in on the secret.  Sandler can act!  It's too bad he'll probably go back to crap like Little Nicky or Mr. Deeds, but once is enough I guess.  And of course I don't have to tell you how amazing Emily Watson is because she's always amazing.  The rest of the cast is pretty underground, with a few of his regulars (Luis Guzman and the BRILLIANT Phillip Seymour Hoffman).

311,Rooster9,"A sweet, poetic story",9,14 November 2006,"P.T. Anderson wanted to make an Adam Sandler film that deconstructed Sandler's popular, bipolar comedic persona. And he does it beautifully. Sandler's Barry is, as Laura Dern once said, ""wild at heart and weird on top."" He's a meek oddball who lives his boring life, submits to the whims of his overbearing sisters and does what he's told. All the while, he's burning up inside. And when he explodes, it's not pretty.He's not the hilarious, club-wielding Happy Gilmore or the bum-rushing Waterboy. But his random acts of insanity are comedy of a curious kind. When he smashes the screen door, it's funny, shocking, frightening, and, ultimately, sad. If Barry tames his manic outbursts, can he save himself from implosion? Enter Lena. She's pretty, unassuming and apparently loves caring for odd things. Lena ushers in a sweet, strange, poetic love story that forces Barry to become a man and put his pent-up passion to good use. And, so, ""Punch Drunk Love"" becomes a surprisingly wonderful romance. It's a movie about anger, love, loneliness, desperation and caring for odd things. And you should definitely watch it.",Punch-Drunk Love

There are people out there who like to go to movies for the escapism and the need not to think, but the people who earn a living from them obviously need to think and forget about the people who make a living in other spheres.If you enjoyed this then good luck to you, if you didn't then I am thankful that there are other people out there with similar thoughts.",Punch-Drunk Love

This isn't necessarily Adam Sandlers best performance, but the character matches his acting style perfectly. Emma Watson's acting was surprisingly good too. The characters are so unpredictable, and random that it makes the audience fall in love with them instant. The plot takes you from point to point in a manner you can't even guess is going, which makes the movie so good. This movie is a hidden gem buried beneath piles and piles of horribly made movies in Hollywood today.

318,objesguy,The Most Original Film Starring Sandler by Leaps and Bounds,9,24 May 2005,"Adam Sandler films usually are comedies filled with slapstick humor and a hefty doses of cursing. Punch Drunk Love is an exception to that formula. Adam Sandler plays a complex character that shares some of the characteristics that he is used to playing in this movie: he is emotionally unstable, he has the mouth of a sailor and he uses a lot of physical comedy by acting like a klutz half the time. However, what separates this film from his rather sub-par and unoriginal films such as Little Nicky and 50 First Dates, is the fact that Paul Thomas Anderson is directing it, and thanks to finally some decent direction and screen writing, Adam Sandler is able to finally take on a whole new kind of role that surprises critics and audiences alike: a serious one.The film itself is wonderfully put together as it chronicles the life of a bumbling, emotionally rocked entrepreneur who's life is put in a spin after meeting a woman he is romantically attached to (played by Emily Watson). Sandler does a great job portraying the bumbling protagonist, acting much differently from other role in his other rather uninspired films. While at times he does show shades of his former past through his outbursts, most of the time he is the anti-Adam Sandler character. He is paranoid, self-doubting and totally detached from human society (much different from the Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison audiences have known and loved). In addition, Sandler's character isn't so attractive to the audience in terms of entertainment and humor, but instead the audience sympathizes with Sandler's character Barry, understanding his emotional problems and hoping that he is able to overcome it with the help and love of Emily Watson's character. Sandler doesn't need slapstick humor to accomplish that feat, and the result is a wonderfully played role that is by far up and above anything he has done before.Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed this film and did a wonderful job, giving a film that is a suitable follow-up to his mega-hit and widely-received film Magnolia. Like Magnolia , the story is amazingly psychotic and complex, and for some strange reason, strikes at the core of the human psyche, for the audience realizes that all of us share Barry's (Sandler) characteristics in more ways than one. However, while the music, the direction and the enjoyable story are all great reasons to see the film, the real winning feature of the movie is Sandler who is able to prove critics and audiences alike that he is ready and more than capable of taking a serious role and doing it extremely well. Granted though, this is not a typical Sandler film, so viewers who are seeing this movie expecting big laughs will be gravely disappointed. However, this movie is still enjoyable nonetheless and the opportunity to see Adam Sandler in a whole new scenario is just one of the millions of reason to see this enjoyable film from Paul Thomas Anderson.",Punch-Drunk Love

The predicament of Barry Egan (Adam Sandler), an explosive, emotionally stunted novelty toilet plunger manufacturer oppressed by well-meaning ministrations of his seven sisters, consigns his story to the social misfit ground familiar to fans of P.T. Anderson's previous efforts. In contrast with them, the redemptive message delivered through unfathomably determined affection of Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), an indeterminately professional colleague of Barry's overweening sister Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub), yields the most uplifting offering to date from an auteur still budding after a six-year, four feature film career. The palpable chemistry and razor-edged timing between Barry and Lena are well complemented by the economic backstory of useless trash production enlivened by a cunningly subverted marketing scheme and a violent phone sex scam, adding up to a tasty date night nostrum of love before first sight.",Punch-Drunk Love

I couldn't imagine this guy in a serious role. ""Punch-Drunk Love"" knocked all those assumptions down for the count. It was absolutely awesome seeing Sandler handle such a deep and complex role with ease.This is the first film I've seen that has Emily Watson in it, so I don't have anything to compare her performance in this film to. But all the same, I think she did a wonderful job as the love interest. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for more of her films.In short, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is wonderfully well-written, smart, and funny. I highly recommend it.",Punch-Drunk Love
327,Jaimzay,"A fascinating, but flawed work",8,21 December 2002,"I can't wait until P. T. Anderson finally makes the great movie he has locked away inside.  You get to see glimpses of it here, just as you did in ""Boogie Nights"" (his best film), the overstuffed mess ""Magnolia"", and even ""Hard Eight"", his maiden voyage.I won't belabor the points already made by others about Adam Sandler's performance--this is an admirable leap for him and he handles it nicely. Anderson does well by tightening the focus of this film:  it is as narrow as ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" are broad.  We get a closer look into the strange and wonderful world of his main character, Barry Egan, and even though he could use some extensive therapy, your heart goes out to him.There are times when you feel that Anderson has zoomed in too far because Emily Watson's character ends up being too much of a mystery, as do his cartoonishly mean-spirited sisters.  The shortcuts he takes to explain their roles in Barry's life, while intriguingly off-center, come at too high of a cost to the narrative.All of Anderson's films have a feel of self-importance that he would do well to shed.  When he does that, and learns how to balance storytelling and characterization, he will join an elite class of directors.  Until then, he's still very good, but frustrating because you know he's capable of more.",Punch-Drunk Love
328,Spamlet,Fascinating,10,4 November 2002,"PT Anderson has always intrigued me to varying degrees. I thought ""Hard Eight"" was interesting but ultimately rather forgettable (I'm anxious to see it again soon to give it another chance). I enjoyed the epicness of ""Boogie Nights"" but wished it had gone deeper into it's numerous characters' souls. I believe ""Magnolia"" to be not only his masterpiece but one of the best American films of the last 20 years. So it was with great interest that I went to see this film. I've always liked Adam Sandler (Billy Madison excepted) and it came as no surprise to me that he had this kind of performance in him.While watching, I was utterly amazed by Anderson's mastery of his craft. Technically, this film looked great, was extremely effective in it's use of mood music, differentiating of tempo and the use of a color palette as expressive as ""Ju Dou"" and ""Blue"".I personally despise when people reveal specifics of plot when reviewing films so I prefer to always be very general in that regard. Suffice it to say that the film is completely unique in terms of the series of events that occur. You've honestly never seen a movie quite like this.Despite all these positives I was initially left somewhat unsatisfied by the film. My problem was that I didn't believe these characters were truly in love. This seemed to be at odds with the expectation I was seeing a love story. I believed they were physically attracted to each other and were both desperate and needy. These things don't add up to true love for me. I couldn't see them sustaining a lifelong partnership based on such a flimsy foundation.Watson's character says that she saw a picture of Sandler and that was why she wanted to meet him. Sandler and the audience never learn anything significant about her personality and he doesn't appear to care to find out. Their love is of a surface nature.It was because of this that I first had the reaction that this film while important for it's groundbreaking melding of disparate cinematic idioms was a case of stunning style over middling substance.Upon reflection a few days later, I've come upon a realization that perhaps the issue is one of intent. In looking at the story as an examination of the tenuous bonds a great majority of modern love stories are built from, I've come to wonder whether the film is as hopeful and optimistic as it appears. Anderson's other films while celebrating deep interpersonal connections have always been cynical in their portrayal of how transient those attachments ultimately are. He and I apparently share this complex mixture of idealistic disillusionment. I consider myself a hopeless romantic who's nevertheless well aware that the outside world has the ability to shatter perfect bliss at any moment. Being in love with Fiona Apple, a very popular and beautiful singer/songwriter, must give Anderson this same kind of awareness of how difficult it is to keep a relationship going strong in this often cruel (dare I use the overdone phrase ""Post 9/11"") world.So instead of a love story, we have a filmmaker who I feel is presenting us with something infinitely more interesting and important. A film that reminds us of old fashioned Hollywood versions of love with the full knowledge that the world changing around us has made those quaint notions of love all but impossible.That isn't to say he (and I) don't believe in love but rather that real, lasting relationships bear little resemblance to those you see in the movies. When you're lucky enough to be truly in love you see right through cute, empty depictions of the real thing.",Punch-Drunk Love

330,WesAndersonFan,One of the best films of 2002,10,25 June 2003,"Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a bizarre, interesting, extraordinarily filmed story of a shy businessman named Barry Egan (Adam Sandler)  who collects pudding coupons to collect frequent flier miles. One night he calls up a phone sex line, and it ends up being a scam. While faced with four blonde, violent brothers who are there to collect money, Barry also has a romance with a mysterious woman named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson). Although the film has too many inner meanings for the average viewer, the intelligent and observant will very probably find this movie fascinating and brilliant. Sandler controls himself and gives a beautiful, Oscar-worthy performance, as does Watson. Recommended to fans of P.T. Anderson (""Hard Eight, ""Boogie Nights"", and ""Magnolia""), although I'm not sure I can recommend it to Sandler fans. 10/10P.S.: I just got the DVD yesterday. Please check it out if you're interested in the film. It is awesome!",Punch-Drunk Love
331,mezenov,Intriguing,9,18 August 2003,"It seemed to me, that PT Anderson decided to make a deliberate detour from creating sweeping emotional epics a-la Magnolia and try something else for a change. Strangely enough, in the end he came up with a very-Tom DiCillo film, turning Adam Sandler into John Turturro in the process. Mind you, that's not a problem with me at all, since I'm a great fan of Tom DiCillo's work and I also happen to consider John Turturro an excellent actor. Punch-Drunk Love is endearing in its small-scale excentrity, but still it feels more like an experiment on behalf of the writer-director, rather than a heartfelt project. Oh well, it doesn't matter all that much I guess, since I greatly enjoyed this film and was once again made certain of the fact that PT Anderson is an excellent director capable of many exciting things. Here's to his next project, friends",Punch-Drunk Love
332,ToddynMissy,Adam Sandler - what did you do. . . . lose a bet?,3,27 June 2003,"Oh my god, this movie was terrible - I rented it and nearly turned it off. The best part was the last 15 minutes . . . the rest was the worst  movie I've seen since ""Do the Right Thing.""  This movie made no since at all, and had nothing to do with reality.  What was the premise/plot???  I've still no clue.  His character should be in a ""nut house"" and this movie should be counted as one of the 100 worst of all time (and the worst Sandler movie).  I thought I was Sandler's biggest fan too - absolutely love the Waterboy, Wedding Singer and Anger Management - - - don't watch this if you're looking for any of that type of a Sandler movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
333,adrian-193,"Paul Thomas Anderson, artist of the visual tone metaphor",8,31 December 2006,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love opens with his signature move: juxtaposition. Adam Sandler, handling a nice Nissan coffee mug in the early morning light on a backstreet in LA, watches as a speeding car comes carooming towards him, flips, flips again, and skids offscreen. And then in place of what ought to follow (continuity with the car accident), a cab appears, stops, and deposits an electric organ. It's the instrument with which he will learn the harmonies of love, and it arrives on the heels of trauma. The scene, strictly visually, is reminiscent of Jane Campion's piano on the beach, or of Herzog's record player aboard the steamer headed up the Amazon in Fitzcarraldo. There is music going on here. It's no secret that Punch Drunk Love is a tone poem. What draws me to PTA's visual ear is his interest in translation. He knows that sound reaches the heart before the image (it is the first sense that comes to mind, in the womb, as we hear our mothers' heartbeat). He knows we have the uncanny ability to name the composer behind a riff played in the style of a modern rock artist but performed by a harmonica trio (as in Magnolia). He knows the operatic line (the group song sung by each of Magnolia's ensemble cast) against harmonic backgrounds (each of Magnolia's cast is struggling with the same song, the same hurt, and together they are a story in the same key). As did Paul Klee, who attempted to paint music by rendering an operatic line over color fields. The two Pauls have much in common. Perhaps, like Nabokov, they are synesthetic? Either way, PTA's style is ""affective"" and his songlines, like those of the Aborigines, are maps to (emotional) territory. He was right in his choice of Sandler, whose performance is a musical score in itself. And Emily Watson can do no wrong (she's one of our finest, a face of infinite depth). The two play awkward music, but in their search for the key to their love, they strike notes and find resonating harmonies. The key to their love is the key in which they play, the chord, the chord that binds. If I were to hazard a guess at PTA's idea, it would be that he knows that in sound you can add and combine, but not obscure or remove. Sound is the medium most suitable to the dance that is the love of a couple. Emotions together, adding to one another, always responding to one another, always and immediately aware of a note off-key. Music is the fragile, fleeting, signature of human relationships. We can get lost in the perfection of image, the celebrity of the gaze, but we don't close the gap until we play together. There are ways to read PTA. But the best way to read him is to listen.",Punch-Drunk Love
334,monkmellon15,"surprise from Sander, but typical pretentious PTA",5,13 June 2005,"I was hesitant to see this movie since I first saw a preview for it, but finally sat down to watch it when my wife brought it home from the video store. I am not at all a Paul Thomas Anderson fan, I find his movies empty, pretentious crap. Not to mention the way he borrows from so many other less revered but more talented directors. I was pleasantly surprised by Adam Sandler's performance as Barry. The poor guy is tormented by his seven overbearing sisters, His uncontrollable temper, his overwhelming shyness, and a deranged phone sex operator out to ruin him. But there is just too much going on in this movie intended as metaphor. The harmonium in his office, the blue suit, even the situation with the phone sex scheme. So much sublimation just makes an empty film. The soundtrack is just about ear-bleedingly obnoxious. and that song from Popeye was just as friggin annoying in the original bad movie, why loop it over and over for 15 straight minuets in another one!? I would like to see Sandler maybe take some more serious roles, since his billy Madison schtick went blandsville after a few movies, but please no more PTA",Punch-Drunk Love

This is a much darker comedy than he had done previously. This film also had a very different storyline. The mixture of the dark humour, drama, suspense and even a touch of romance was what made this film stand out for me. Unusual yes, but very enjoyable. I absolutely loved it! Brazo. Emily Watson is outstanding and the female love part. Although quite why she stays with Adam's character is a touch hard to believe.

336,piperian396,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,1 January 2008,"I bought this movie on VHS figuring that since it is an Adam Sandler movie it is good for at least a few laughs. I knew that it had to be different than his other ones because no one ever talks about it. I was shocked to find out exactly how different it was.Adam Sandler plays the kind of person that you try to make sure that you do not turn out like when you grow up. He has next to no close friends, he almost never does anything fun, and the chances of him ever finding love are slim to none. But in this movie you begin to really feel a bond with this unusual hero.The performances are great, the cinematography is stunning, and the plot is fantastic. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys fine offbeat cinema.",Punch-Drunk Love
337,Hurr78,An Orgy of Skill,9,16 October 2002,"PT Anderson and Adam Sandler have created a very mature, exquisitely skilled film. Punch-Drunk Love does not feature the manic Sandler of so many previous films. We knew that Sandler could act. The Wedding Singer showed that he could give us a character with reasonable emotional complexity. In Punch-Drunk Love, we can see the tremendous emotional burdens that his character carries around every day... until a series of seemingly random events suddenly bring out a violent flurry of changes in his life. He has always been made to feel small, yet love makes him stronger and bolder than he had ever imagined he could be.Punch-Drunk Love is the sort of film that gets better and better as you replay it in your mind. Like Magnolia, it builds to an emotional climax in which a lifetime of self-repression is exploded. But unlike that film, it places its burning gaze onto a single character... and Adam Sandler is given a chance to show that he can make both real emotion and genuine catharsis come to life on the silver screen. I, for one, found myself completely charmed by the film, taken into the improbable life and redemption of a shy, pained little man in a big blue suit. I suspect and hope that many others will too.",Punch-Drunk Love
338,edawstwin,"Bizarre, Hilarious, Story of True Love.",9,28 October 2002,"I haven't been more pleased leaving a theater since I saw Mulholland Drive for the third time late last year.  While I was not a big fan of P.T. Anderson's previous movies, I found myself wanting to see this movie again, and I probably wouldn't even mind paying for it (this was a free screening). Adam Sandler is basically himself without the childish impersonations and the anger turned up a few notches.  He has quite a few nice moments, not the least of which is an impromptu dance of joy.  Emily Watson is actually smart and radiant (haven't liked a single one of her films until now) and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman were perfect as usual.There are a couple of sub-plots (one based on a true story of pudding and frequent flier miles) that are as bizarre as Adam Sandler actually acting, but they really work in this film.  It's hard to call this a ""romantic comedy"", but our leads fall in love and I laughed out loud throughout the film, so it gets that label.  But it's certainly the most unconventional romantic comedy I've seen in years.",Punch-Drunk Love

I've yet to see all the PTA films and this one is easily in my top 3 if not my favorite. I get so attached to Sandler's character Barry and you feel for him. The romance is executed so perfectly with the gorgeous score that fits the emotions of the scenes so well. On top of this, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is perfect in it as he usually is! Equally as impressive that the Sandman goes toe to toe with Hoffman and equals his energy. This may be the greatest romance movie ever made (close second is Stolen Kisses by Truffaut). Love this movie",Punch-Drunk Love
340,Will_Malone,Sandler shines in this unexpected gem,9,8 September 2012,"They say that every one has a book in them. If that is true then I reckon every movie star has at least one good film in them and Punch-Drunk Love is Adam Sandler's one good film. I remember listening to UK film critic Mark Kermode before he planned to watch Sandler's horrendously double-acted Jack and Jill, he stated that as low as Sandler has sunk of late he still goes into each of his new releases remembering that Sandler was in Punch-Drunk Love. This gives him hope, for a short time anyway.Punch-Drunk Love tells that story of Barry Egan (Sandler) a slightly beleaguered small businessman who has been so mollycoddled and henpecked by his seven sisters that he seems to have developed borderline psychiatric issues as well as an occasional fearsome rage. Egan clearly craves peace, happiness and above all else stability to the chaos that he feels he lives in. Early one morning whilst opening his toilet plunger business help arrives from two quarters; firstly a mysterious harmonium is delivered outside his premises followed swiftly by an inquisitive woman named Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) who appears keen to make his acquaintance . Through both Egan learns to channel his inner rage towards a more productive outcome.I have not seen any of Paul Thomas Anderson's previous work but anyone that can conjure up this kind of performance out of Adam Sadler deserves some critical attention. Sandler is simply outstanding in this career high role. Through him you feel Egan's unease, his confusion, his sadness and indeed his feelings of love. Sometimes these feelings come through in such deep measures that it felt quite overpowering; I simply cannot remember being quite so invested in an on-screen character before. Sandler's performance was so unexpected that it reminded me of Jim Carrey's in Eternal Sunshine of Spotless Mind.Emily Watson as Lena is equally impressive as she carefully, respectfully and at times apprehensively tip toes her way into Egan's life. She is clearly carrying some baggage of her own as well which is never really explored, but you get the strong feeling she understands what's going on in Egan's head. The chemistry between them is evident and they seem to flow off each other well. In one particular scene where Lena channels Egan's aggressive side into a more intimate setting, you can clearly see the influence this film had on Sarah Polly's recent drama Take This Waltz. In fact these two films would work well as a double bill.There are some entertaining cameos thrown in for good measure, with the lead credit given to Philip Seymour Hoffman. Here he stars as as the owner of a mattress store which doubles as a sex phone line centre called by Egan during a moment of introspection, which leads to unexpected consequences. Out of Egan's seven sisters we only really spend time with Elisabeth, played by 24's Mary Lynn Rajskub, who is convincing but perhaps a little too CTU, however my favourite cameo has to go to Robert Smigel as Walter the Dentist. A conversation between Egan and Walter had me laughing out loud and reaching for the rewind button to watch it again.Anderson's direction is short, snappy and incredibly visually attractive. Colour is every where and each frame is beautifully shot. Anderson uses the screen to demonstrate Egan's confusion and in one particularly telling scene, he shows Egan running through the maze of corridors trying to find Lena's apartment. This is a powerful and effective demonstration of Egan's state of mind. I suspect that on return viewings (which are inevitable) I will discover more hidden gems which passed me by on this first viewing.Whilst I was expecting this film to be good, I was still surprised at just how good it was. Sandler is a revelation, I wonder if he knows just how good he and this film was? I really hope he does.Review by Will Malone",Punch-Drunk Love

I have it a 1/10 because I couldn't give it a 0.  We were confused through the whole movie as to the theme.  I sat trying to figure out what a description of the movie would say.

And most of all, it is terribly slowly told. You really want to watch this movie at double speed (at least) and you're really lucky when your DVD player supports pitch adjustment for audio at double speed viewing. And the ""art""??

Never heard anything like that before. Which left me with a feeling of... OK, nothing really surprising. Phil Hoffman... talk about an underdeveloped character... why is he in the phone sex business? What else does he do? Say shut up a lot? Seemed liked a missed opportunity there. I guess many will love this movie just cause Mr. Anderson put it out. Love is blind, right... I just wish it had a bit more to it. I am sure many will go on and on about all the nuances and ""brilliant"" developments and the montage of family dynamics... You could see many of those same things if you stare at TV static long enough... and that doesn't even cost any money...

He deserved to bethere ahead of some of the nominees (no names, but Gangs of New Yorksprings to mind...)And Adam Sandler.

Watching two models dither about whether or not they want to be together for two hours is a waste of time. This film is a refreshing antidote to the dismal tide of mediocre romantic comedies designed to be consumed by mediocre minds. The biggest obstacle I have ever faced in any relationship is truly my own ingrained psychology. Stupid people fall in an out of love all the time. It is easy for them. They don't have any real psychological hang-ups because they have never bothered to look that deeply into themselves. This is a romantic comedy for neurotics and homebodies. This is a romantic comedy for all those people who would like to find that special someone, but are smart enough to know that they probably never will.

""Punch Drunk Love"" is not an ""Adam Sandler"" movie. He may be the star and main character (Barry), but for once he doesn't simply play himself (or one the many variants on himself). This is simply a great movie. I'm not saying this to build my movie-snob credentials either. Sure, PT Anderson throws us a few surreal curves (i.e the car crash/harmonium drop off) and some great colours and images, but it is basically an excellent depiction of your average socially inept, emotionally scarred individual, to whom the thought of an actual relationship is a fantasy.",Punch-Drunk Love
351,nintendovi,"A Realistic, Awkward world.",6,27 March 2008,"I think Adam Sandler's acting in Punch-Drunk Love was pretty decent. I could relate to the character - he got pushed around throughout his entire life by everyone, even his own sister, and he finally wanted to stand up for himself when he fell in love. The story, about taking advantage of a TV Dinner coupon offer, was pretty smart and helped to farther show the main character's attention to little details. And his confrontation with a bully at the end of the movie was interesting also, if a little sad.But Punch-Drunk Love is actually a happy movie, it just shows one man going through depressing events to find that happiness. You may hear a lot of people criticize this movie, but that is only because they aren't used to Sandler taking on more serious roles.

I want to see more movies like this. Oh, the review wouldn't be complete without talking about the astounding background score , especially at moments when the pair meet each other .

What was Adam Sandler thinking when he accepted this part...to show his versatility as a dramatic actor complete with idiosyncrasies? One can only hope that Adam did this as a favor for the director...surely his manager did not advise him to take on this project!

Especially if it feels genuinely rehearsed. All that aside, Punch- Drunk Love is one of my favourite Romantic Comedies.Meet Barry Egan, socially awkward businessman and passionate human being. One of the reasons I like this movie is because it has Adam Sandler, sans his comedy shtick, and he shines. The fluidity with the way he approached the dramatics was refreshing and familiar in the same light. Barry is a pretty walled-in character, due in part by his seven sisters that always seem to be on his case. You can feel the tension and tempered violence in his character almost immediately and the direction with how we get to know Barry is so superb that you'll find yourself identifying with him.The film itself is beautiful, Paul Thomas Anderson did an awesome job at both writing and directing. With the bits of art-house mixed in, it's a unique take on a seriously beaten dead-horse. Everything seems in place, from the lighting to the dialogue, to the heavily featured score, it pulls you in and keeps you there- almost making you forget the mushiness before you. To even out the cast we have Lena, the love interest; Lance, Barry's right-hand employee; Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub), the match-making sister and a rewarding Dean, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Being one of the pushy, prying sisters, Elizabeth opts to setup Barry with a coworker friend. Suffice it to say, the two hit it off and Lena seems to inspire a bit of passion in Barry that looks to help him shake the shell he bottled himself in. because of the constant ragging he gets from his sisters, Barry seems to bottle his anger and resentment, only to have it trigger violent outbursts whenever childhood taunts are brought up in conversation. Barry finds himself in a bind though, after an outburst at a family party he takes a step out for some casual conversation - just to have someone to talk to - with a phone-sex hotline and the culmination of this encounter highlights how the brief burst of romance with Lena changed him.The writing gives you just enough of each character that you don't grow sick of them and the pace seems slow at first but only because it eases you in gracefully. This is easily one of the best romance films post-2000 and I want to elaborate more but the *spoiler* ice is very thin. If, no, when you find a copy of this movie I'd like for you to have an experience of your own because it's just that, an awesome experience and a refreshing trek into the love genre, quite the shame that it's still flying so low under the radar. With the advent of LMN and the Oxygen Channel, I was sure this would get some play. If it did, colour me corrected, if not, do yourself that favour and cozy up with your special someone this cupid season.Standout Line: ""I'm looking at your face and I just wanna smash it.

It would be an understatement to say this is Sandler's best performance; more accomplished and fully realized than anything, and to me and hopefully to Sandler fans it was a revelation seeing him release himself from his usual routine. It must be said that during my viewing of this film, the audience became impatient by NOT seeing Sandler in his normal Sandler autopilot mode, which was a sad sight. Instead they gave up, walked out not even interested in seeing Sandler demonstrating what is truly inside his acting soul.

But as the movie progressed I realized that this was PTA trying something new.  A test movie, if you will.Punch-Drunk Love was an excellent piece of PTA's evolution as a writer/director.

The performances were awesome, and it was interesting to see Adam Sandler depart from his standard schtick, and Philip Seymour Hoffman rocked, as always.Definitely check this one out... especially if you're a film student.  It's a killer study.",Punch-Drunk Love
362,mcrasterix,Anderson's bittersweet candy...,10,27 January 2008,"With only two big movies (Boogie Nights and Magnolia) many people have classified P.T Anderson as a dramatic director, with a little touch of black humor and disapproval for censure in violence, sex and drugs alike. Punch-Drunk Love proves, more than just them, it proves every single PTA fan wrong (I include myself) Punch Drunk Love is one of those films where, the thing that rocks is not the story, but its main character: Adam Sandler (the one that we can identify in most cases as the happy and stupid average American citizen) plays the total opposite: Barry Egan, a cold and totally antisocial persona, who is dominated by his 7 manipulative sisters and who reacts in animal way when someone expresses a human emotion to him, like love. Punch Drunk love is a trip to the mind of the human being, a psychodelic masterpiece that combines both pleasure and rage, sadness and happiness, and explores what kind of emotions and feelings can be unleashed when the one that is unloved is loved 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love

This shows that Barry and Schmidt live a lonely life. Schmidt finds the meaning of life as he writes a letter to Ndugu, and Barry as he loves a woman. It is fascinating when Barry screams at the owner of the phone sex company, ""I am in love and I am stronger than you can imagine."" When Barry is alone, he is destructive and isolated. However, he is ""someone"" when he is loved and trusted by Lena. I can see myself through Barry. When I feel lonely, I am like Barry. When I feel stronger than ever, I am with my family and God. Obviously, two are better than one. Barry is the one who needs a psychiatrist when he is alone, and he is a different person when he is with Lena. He has the courage to confront the phone-sex entrepreneur.I had a question about the blue suit which Barry wore throughout the movie. Anderson answers in an interview that he needed to have cool colors because he was going to make a movie about love.",Punch-Drunk Love
364,rc_whittle,Deeply disappointing attempt at a serious role for Sandler,2,28 June 2003,"I'm stunned after seeing this film, just utterly amazed that Sandler agreed to do this movie, did he read the script??It's an empty movie with no dynamics, it goes nowhere from start to finish, and when it does end one is left wondering if what we just watched was actually a movie.If I ever see Adam Sandler I will ask him for the $4 I paid to rent this movie, plus the 2 hours of my life back.Somewhere in here there is a love story, Adam Sandler and Emily Watson make like the most awkward and unendearing lovers I've ever seen, and a bizarre story about a sex-line call that Sandler's character makes.There are moments of insane violence against inanimate objects, they are inter-sprinkled with moments of awkward scenes between the love interests.The location of Hawaii makes an appearance... for a few minutes of the film and the relevance of this location change is quickly realized and spent into meaninglessness.There is a seeming betrayal by Sandler's character, and then for no apparent reason that is forgiven and forgotten.The love stories in teeny movies have deeper meaning, and the ""love"" itself is less believable than in pornography.I read somewhere that this was an ""art movie"", well if that's the case then I don't like art movies and I certainly would recommend that anyone that enjoys films miss this one and watch ""Mr Deeds"" or ""Happy Gilmore"" to get their Sandler based kicks.In this one, opera-man he aint.As an addendum who the hell chose that awful song ""He needs me""?It has to rank as the most irritating song by the most untalented performer in any movie I've seen. I think the singers name was Shelley Duvall if so, Shelley, please find something non-vocal chord related to do with your life.

365,mharvick2002,"I loved, loved, loved this movie!",10,26 March 2003,"Honestly, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything about this movie is great. You'll never see Adam Sandler do any better. He is so involved in his character, and you forget it is him. It's the little things that he does that make sit so great. When he starts to get mad, he doesn't explode, but you see it in his face that at any moment, he will. The relationship he has with Emily Watson's character is great. You really feel the chemistry between them. Even though this film did have some of it weird points, like the whole beginning, and how nothing of it is explained. That didn't matter. You don't care about that. The way that P.T. Anderson wrote and directed this movie, all you care about are Adam and Emily's characters. I would recommend this movie to everyone. Even to people who don't like Adam Sandler, because I don't really like him either but this movie will make you think otherwise. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it an A+. If I had to rate form a scale from 1-100 I would give it a 98 because it is not a perfect movie, the only movie that I can say is perfect is the Godfather. All I have to say is go see this movie.

366,peterbonilla1029,Too Short!,7,4 July 2003,"I usually don't say this about a movie, but I actually think this one was too short. Especially when you consider that the movie this follows up, Magnolia, was twice as long. The whole thing felt too fast, like everything just happened in one big whirlwind. The film was lacking in a lot of areas, particularly in character description. At the end, I really just didn't have much sense of who these characters I was watching actually were. Part of Paul Thomas Anderson's charm is that he can string an audience along for three hours and keep them spellbound the entire way through. With this film the opposite happened. I felt like I was bombarded by the whole thing, and think that 90 minutes was far too short a time to tell this story in. I wouldn't have complained if this movie was thirty or forty minutes longer.
On the upside, I was extremely impressed by Mr. Sandler's acting, and pleasantly surprised by his ability to carry a straight film. Emily Watson is great as usual, though I wish they spent more time on her character. Ditto for Philip Seymour Hoffman. Mixed review, but still see it. If P.T. Anderson leaves anything to doubt, it certainly not his incredible gift for film. 7/10",Punch-Drunk Love
367,Jonkun227,What a waste of potential,5,2 April 2005,"This movie is mediocre at best. There was so much potential but it was wasted on meaningless skits.Most of the negative reviews of this movie focus on the lack of a plot. I disagree. I think there was a plot, it just wasn't very deep. It wasn't deep because the director didn't want you to focus on the plot. This is a character study, and as such an overly complicated plot would only distract.What a shame then that the characters were underdeveloped and what little we do experience of their lives is distracted by pointless and meaningless interactions with a phone sex extortionist who also runs a mattress store in Provo, Utah. Quick sidebar: The guy pays 4 dorks to drive their old pickup to LA to get money from Adam Sandler. He tells them that their expenses are their own, meaning they have to pay for food and gas. Provo is about 45 minutes from my home. I drive a Honda Civic that gets 30 mpg. At current gas prices it costs me over $200 in gas alone to drive to LA and back. The truck isn't getting anything better than 15 mpg, and that's a conservative estimate based on the 3 trucks in my family of similar vintage. So we're looking at over $400 in gas to go retrieve $500. Does anyone else recognize how pointless and ultimately damaging to the movie as a whole the entire Utah/phone sex/extortion scheme is? Couldn't anyone possibly have thought up a more meaningful and relevant conflict for Barry to face? There are so many options:Man vs. Self; Man vs. Man; Man vs. Nature; Man vs. World; Man vs. Space Aliens is a better option than Barry Egan vs. a weak character who sells mattresses and extorts money from people.The writing is awful. Every character, no matter what their background, talks the same. This is, in my opinion, a horrible crime in any movie. But in a character study it should be grounds for banishment from Hollywood. Fortunately Mr. Anderson hasn't worked much since PDL.The positives:The characters had potential. Barry & Lena could have been the foundation of a moving, meaningful film. Instead they're just a couple of oddballs you won't miss when the movie is over. But because they were original and had that potential, the movie earned a few points on my scorecard.The photography was impressive. There is camera work that every film student should study. As a professional photographer myself I'll be trying to emulate some of them, though most don't translate well into still images. This was one of the main reasons I stuck with the show instead of going to bed early. And one of the reasons I'm up tonight after the movie ended so I could share all this with you.Writing: 2 out of 10 (were some funny moments, but not enough to forgive the sloppy character definition); Direction: 4 out of 10 (very consistent, yet consistently headed nowhere); Photography: 8 out of 10 (impressive); Acting: 6 out of 10 (better than average, but nothing to get excited about)Total scientifically averaged score: (um, carry the two, divide by 4) 5! Perfectly mediocre.If you want good character studies, go see Lost in Translation, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, or Little Man Tate. Don't waste your time with this one unless you are a student of photography or you're dating the director's daughter or something.",Punch-Drunk Love

I am not a big Adam Sandler fan and was pretty much entertained with his performance. There is something i must comment about how PTA can bring out that certain essence with actors that no one else have done before. Tom Cruise was an example in Magnolia. This time round is Adam Sandler.I can't quite describe the storyline here cos there are so many other online critics who can do a better job in that area. Like most of them, i can't quite make sense of the story. Some called it rubbish, some say surreal ( like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind) ,some say they just love it. I am in between. There are interesting moments in this film. Even when you get bored or confused with the story line, relax.... just enjoy the colours and the picture of the film. It is a strange love,psycho,sicko,angry and hearwarming show. Can't associate all these words together? well this is a PTA movie! Don't try to solve every instances which is questionable, just try to accept that this is a very off-tempo film which doesn't require much thoughts at times.

370,Max-113,"Misinterpreted ""Pillow Talk"" Scene is the crux of the movie",10,26 June 2003,"This post is assumes that you've seen the movie.People are saying that this scene is just another sign of Barry and Lena's awkwardness, but this is not all there is to it. Anderson keeps the viewer constantly in a state of angst concerning whether Barry will absolutely lose his place in the world and be labeled once and for all as a lunatic. But he's almost cured again and again by Lena's total acceptance of him, and calming effect. She is utterly unlike any woman Barry has ever been close to. The fact is that Barry has a justified and deep mistrust and hatred of the women in his life. We know this from every interaction between Barry and his sisters-- especially the Hawaiian pay phone conversation.
So this brings me back to the face smashing comment. The fact is that in this scene Barry is speaking the unspeakable truth about his condition, which is that he has so much pent up hate inside himself that it is difficult for him to deal with his dual attraction/repulsion to women. It's also a climax in the sense that finally Barry has gone too far and unambiguously revealed that he has a deeply troubled, sick personality. When I was watching I gasped when he said it. But then Lena demonstrated with her response exactly why she was the right woman for Barry after all. Instead of an awkward response, it was the exact opposite. It was full of the grace that is the root of Lena's healing powers. She is ultimately devoid of any of the anxiety-inducing characteristics of Barry's sisters, and this is the source of her healing effect when combined with the mild delusion that comes along with a new love or infatuation. This beautiful and terrifying moment is rare in films, and this is part of what makes this film a masterpiece. (Please feel free to point out similar moments to me via messaging.)",Punch-Drunk Love
371,galexandre,Pure cinematic delight,9,15 May 2002,"It comes as no surprise that the new PT Anderson movie is more than awaited... and well, it shall not disappoint anyone who has a taste in cinema! With a sharp knowledge of the human soul, and with more than an outstanding talent for direction and for the use of every little detail that makes of an apparently trivial movie a unexpected classic, P.T. Anderson has directed an outstanding work-of-art. The story revolves around Barry Egan, a business company otner (or is he really?) who, almost at once, finds a lost harmonium on the sidewalk, meets a girl he would never had ever dreamt of, and gets chased by a bunch of crooks who own a phone-sex company in Utah. With these three ingredients delightfully entertwined, Punch-Drunk Love is in the same time an over-the-top romantic love-story, a paranoid thriller and a surrealistic trip through a man's mind. Without forgetting this uncomparable dreamlike edge, as if the film was seen through a haze. Characterization is excellent, with Adam Sandler putting aside his moronic attitudes and concentrating on a very unexpected role. Barry, who could be seen, at first, as a somewhat lighter Forrest Gump, bullied by his atrocious sisters who always considered him as the top loser of the family, once carried away by the power of love eventually discovers his strength and his long lost humanity. I know, put that way, it may sound corny, but hell this film isn't. P.T. Anderson isn't the kind of man to be bothered by cliches: he just slaloms between them, sprinkling the scenes with drops of surrealistic acid (like the car accident at the beginning), and joyously using cinematographic references (the frantic chase, with Barry running amongst warehouses, chased by shadows as in an expressionist movie, or the kiss, staged as in a shadow show). This without even mentionning the delirious music by Jon Brion, which takes the images to an even higher ground. Almost always on, the score adds to the inner turmoil of Barry, sometimes almost covering the dialogues : the effect is striking, emotions like pleasure or discomfort being multiplied by ten. This film is really an experience, a rollercoaster ride through emotions, as much as it is one for Barry's soul throughout his adventure. Please don't be bothered by the apparent strangeness of Punch-Drunk Love, for it is the warmest, most dreamlike film you will probably encounter for a long, long while.",Punch-Drunk Love
372,Draykov,A different kind of love story...,7,13 November 2002,"If weird and slow aren't your thing, just hang in there past the first 10 or 15 minutes. The payoff is worth it. Part of the beauty and originality of this film is that it is so focused on the characters and their plight, that some of the details are left to your imagination and/or symbolic interpretation. Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) is a slightly warped, yet ultimately lovable character. Once you get a feel for his relationship with his 7 psychotic, self-esteem eroding, manipulative sisters, you can't help but feel for the guy. Those chicks made me want to poke my eyes out (which makes the phone booth scene oh so satisfying). The gist of it is that Barry ends up embarking upon a meaningful relationship with Lena, a friend of his sister's from work. The catch is that, prior to meeting Lena, Barry makes a naive attempt to seek companionship...through a phone sex line. Barry obviously doesn't really understand what he's getting himself into, both in the sense that he's so desperate for pleasant female contact that he's willing to give up some highly sensitive information to a total stranger, and also in the sense that he expected it to be a somewhat innocent encounter. Needless to say, it comes back to haunt him during his attempt to make a go of it with his new girl. Music - I can't say enough about it. It sets the mood so well and the unlikely choices (Shelley Duvall's ""He Needs Me"" from Popeye?!) blend in with the characters and mood of the rest of the film seamlessly.This movie peaked my interest when I started hearing about it after Sundance. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to see it. Adam Sandler is great (think Robbie Hart from 'Wedding Singer' meets Rain Man), Emily Watson is enjoyable, and the increasingly underrated (in my opinion) Luis Guzman does a wonderful job in his small role. If your looking for something original that makes you think and feel, this is it.",Punch-Drunk Love
373,bdorfman,Drab Pseudo-Surrealism compared with Mulholland Dr.,6,30 October 2002,"I disliked PDL for some of the reasons I loved Mulholland Dr. (2001).  The film is full of strange and symbolic images, staging, dialogue, and sound. Every shot/scene intentionally breaks with conventional storytelling and filmmaking....The camera focuses on the corner of a cabinet instead of Sandler...silences between characters are long and uncomfortable...still shots are broken with abrupt action...much of what is done and said appears to have no immediate purpose or meaning.  As a result, people naturally try to interpret and ascribe meaning (just read some of these other reviews), which can be a lot of fun and very interesting.  Unfortunately, in PDL, it's neither.  First, unlike Mulholland Dr., which did the same things (and more) with lush, sexy, and interesting imagery...PDL is stark and mundane. Second, I think much of what Anderson does is gratuitous..it doesn't  add up to some deeper message or idea.  Though there may be no specific ""meaning"" to Mulholland Dr., Lynch has me convinced there is...Anderson didn't pull that off.",Punch-Drunk Love
374,steph4,a new standard...,2,17 December 2002,"I had to wait over a month after seeing Punch Drunk Love to write this. It took that long to get the unparalleled hatred out of my system. Still, this is easily the worst film I have ever sat through (Congrats Island of Dr. Moreau...you're now #2!) I've never walked out of a movie, but it almost happened here. This movie is annoying, pointless and well, stupid. The characters don't have depth; they're crazy. There is a difference. It showed me nothing about life. Never made me laugh. Not that I could understand the dialogue under the migraine-worthy music. Romantic? Realistic? God help us all if this is reality. Personally, I'm using this movie as a new standard of badness. ""Oh yes, it was boring, but it wasn't 'Punch Drunk' boring."" I also think it may be a good test of sanity. I'm sorry, but if you liked this movie, I'm worried about you. Identifying with these characters is not for the well adjusted among us. For everyone else, 90 minutes of dental work would probably be more pleasant than this movie going experience.",Punch-Drunk Love
375,Alex-506,"A funny, odd, surprisingly sweet film.",8,5 January 2003,"I never thought that I would be using the names Adam Sandler and Travis Bickle in the same sentence.  But there they are.  Leave it to Paul Thomas Anderson to see some strange connection between the bizarre comedian (although I have NEVER found Sandler funny) and the classic deranged urban loner.Why do I mention Bickle?  Because Punch-Drunk Love is, in many ways, like Taxi Driver spun in a more optimistic direction.  It's like what would have happened if Travis had met someone as warm and forgiving as Emily Watson rather than the cool ice queen Cybill Shepherd.  Barry Egan is a character I cared about more than any other at the movies in 2002, probably because I can identify with him more than I'd care to admit.Certainly, Sandler's performance as Egan is one of the greats of the year. Sandler and great are two other words I never thought would appear in the same sentence.  But he is amazing...both likeable and disturbingly violent at times.  Despite his outbursts, I truly cared for Egan, and was overcome with joy that he was able to find happiness both in love and in pudding. Yes, if you've seen the movie, you'll get that one.I was impressed by Hard Eight, but I wasn't raving about Boogie Nights the way most people were.  Although the opening half of the movie was fantastic, the second half retreated into poor Pulp Fiction/Goodfellas imitations. Still, I could tell that Paul Thomas Anderson had that rare combination: cinematic talent and loving compassion for humanity.  All of that came to the fore in the masterful 1999 film Magnolia, which ranks as one of my favourites of the decade.  Despite Anderson's obvious talent, I wasn't sure that he could make Sandler give a genuine, heartfelt performance rather than letting him resort to his old trick of ironic detachment.  But the proof is in the pudding, so to speak.I have to mention Emily Watson, who is like a ray of sunshine both on the film and for Egan himself.  She's not your typical Hollywood beauty (although she is very pretty)...but she made me fall in love with her, and also in an odd way made me love Sandler's character even more.  Also, kudos to the supporting work by Luis Guzman and by that woman who played Sandler's sister (the main one of the seven...I forget the actresses' name).If the film has one weakness, I think, it's the subplot involving Philip Seymour Hoffman and the whole phone-sex thing.  It feels a little tacked on (although it does provide Sandler with an outlet to show his violent feelings...and it adds tension to an otherwise sweet romantic comedy). Hoffman is one of my favourite actors, but here I think he's a little underused.  Still, it's a minor complaint.On the whole, this is my second favourite film of 2002 (after the masterful and underrated Minority Report...which I think will stand as one of the greats).  I don't often enjoy romantic comedies, but this one was genuinely funny and genuinely romantic.  It really was like falling in love...even if it was of the punchdrunk variety.",Punch-Drunk Love

If you are a normal person in a healthy relationship, I can see that you might have trouble connecting with the lives of the main characters, but if you are like the rest of us and could use some therapy, you will feel this movie touch you very deeply. The director doesn't linger with too many details, from the first scene, you're aware of the humanness of Barry Egan. You might feel sorry for him sometimes, but it's more likely that you'll identify with him instead. P.T. Anderson could have expanded more on who these people are and why they are unhappy, but the movie would become a logical setpiece, instead of the ""flow of feelings"" it is.On a completely different note, I was also reminded at times of the movie -- ""Crash"" (David Cronenberg).",Punch-Drunk Love

381,undercover_at_the_movies,Adam Sandler is no Jim Carrey,6,29 October 2010,"Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson who would later bring us There Will Be Blood, Punch-Drunk Love was an offbeat romance starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. Sandler played Barry Egan, a small-business owner who is attempting to deal with anger and depression issues while keeping all seven of his sisters off of his back. The movie drew me in right away because of the somewhat bizarre opening. It began with and maintained a somewhat quiet nature with minimal dialogue and music. While it was a bit slow, the story was interesting enough to keep me watching.As Egan, Sandler has been reviewed very strongly. While I do agree that as with Reign Over Me, Sandler had a great departure from his medium and did well in the dramatic field, he played Charlie Fineman (from Reign Over Me) much better than that of Barry Egan. Barry had wonderful and intense explosions of emotion, but it was nothing compared to that of Charlie's deep depression and self-inflicted amnesia. However, watching Sandler play Barry Egan certainly strengthened my belief in him as a dramatic actor. From now on, I will follow him blindly down the road to any role he so chooses. Emily Watson did the best she could in her small supporting actress role as his love interest. I have not had the opportunity to see her in other films, but based on this, I would not be opposed to watching her in a starring role. As well, Phillip Seymour Hoffman had a brief cameo and as he always does, greatly excelled.In terms of directorial style, there were a few things similar between this and There Will Be Blood, a movie which you would not think to compare this to. One thing that P.T. Anderson did in both was build a very slow and weird beginning, not letting viewers know what to think about the movie initially. Another quality found in both was the rise of aggression and power which the lead actors experience throughout the movie. It grows and grows until it boils over, exploding at which point the lead then becomes happier and more complacent than at the start of the film. Unfortunately, these are the only two of his films which I have seen so I cannot make much of a comparison to any of his others.Overall, this felt like the last few movies I have watched. I appreciated the effort and I saw qualities in it that I liked, but I just did not like it that much. I can understand all of the acclaim that it received though; it was a big first for Adam Sandler, playing a more dramatic role than in previous films. In addition, it was a well put together film and as I said above a well directed film. If you are a fan of indie feeling romances with a hint of the strange, then this is for you. Think Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind with a much more indie feel.",Punch-Drunk Love

383,Lazersetcetera,Love this knockabout comedy,9,8 May 2004,"I'm often suspicious of films with maguffins. Sometimes they are substitutes for solid hooks for the plot to hang off. Still, PTA has a handle on them...So we have a little piano which does not drive the story forward and long, lingering shots of a stark warehouse. Heavy chunks of langourous atmosphere, softened with ethereal cocktail music - in an Adam Sandler comedy clocking in at 90 minutes? Should be awful.Not so. It's fabulous. I laughed so hard at times I had to wipe a tear. I won't bother with spoilers but the telephone girl and the pudding collection are very funny indeed.PTA gets the best out of monkeyboy. He keeps Sandler's energy pressed down, allowing him to vent ferociously when released. Note the way the handle his over the top door trashing at his sister's house.Two contrasting points to illustrate....something.the restraint by Sandler and Hoffman in the final confrontation is very funny and totally realistic. It contrasts wonderfully with sandler's golf club attack on the brothers, which, in a jolly comedy is jaw-droppingly violent.Excellent work all round.

All I can say is that you shouldn't expect much from the storyline, but I really felt sympathy with the Adam Sandler character especially how people keep hounding him about any decisions he makes which he dodges by instinctively lying.*Spoiler* One subplot is seemingly disjointed and that is the one with the pudding. I am not sure if that is to portray his attempt at freeing himself from his paranoia of his seven sisters or if the story was added on as an afterthought as he struggles to get airline tickets to Hawaii.

386,citizengotto,A Rare Gem.,10,2 November 2002,"Punch Drunk Love is a rare film. Romantic, without being cutesy. Dramatic, without being melo-dramatic and over the top. And an Adam Sandler movie that is actually funny.I've been a fan of director P.T. Anderson since Boogie Nights, and make a point of seeing his films as soon as I can. I was a little wary of this one when I heard about it (""He's doing a movie with WHO?"") but one of the great things about P.T. Anderson is that, like Tarantino, he's able to write great scripts with specific actors in mind. Punch Drunk Love is proof of that. Sandler plays his usual rage-filled-man-child, but this time its a sympathetic character, and not one that is by any means condescending (unlike say, The Waterboy).The movie opens as Sandler's character, Barry Egan is in mid-phone call with Healthy Choice, regarding their promotion for frequent flier miles. It's a rare movie that throws you directly into a characters life, without a lot of exposition. As the movie unfolds, Egan's backstory is slowly revealed, and we understand his rage and are sympatheic toward it. Not because the movie asks us to be, but because it is the natural human reaction. (and granted, I'm sure a lot of people will not be sympathetic). Sandler's performance is incredible. (Theres a sentence I never thought I would say.) As he trashes a restaurant bathroom and then denies it to the manager, we see on his face the embarrasment this is causing him and his shame at having to leave with his date (Emily Watson,) who he has grown increasingly smitten with.
Emily Watson, too, is incredible (as always). She likes Barry, but is somewhat bewildered by him (as is the audience). But she gives him a chance (perhaps, we think, because she has no other options?) and watching their love affair unfold is 1,000 times more romantic than anything starring Julia Roberts.If you walk into this movie expecting Mr. Deeds, you will be disappointed. (As was most of the audience in the theatre I saw it in. I heard more than one, ""What the hell was that?"" like comments). So if you want to see an Adam Sandler movie, go rent one. If you want to see a good movie, go see Punch Drunk Love.",Punch-Drunk Love
387,forgions,See it and be relieved,10,24 November 2006,"This movie is very, very good. And well thought out. If you'd like, recognize similarities between Adam Sandler and Jacques Tati, since there are lots of them- especially in the clumsinesses, the oblivious initiations into seemingly unintended color schemes, etc. I do not want to reprimand those who thought this movie boring but will do so anyway. Did you watch it all? And, if you did, how long did it take you to make your needy discrimination? Watch it again with some Bose speakers and maybe you'll understand. Period! Okay just to fill up the rest of these ten lines, (please move down to the other comments if you are having a crisis which in some way involves the juxtaposition of the brevity of life next to the eternity of death and the consequent avoidance of time-wasters), but this film is my favorite. I love it. It makes me happy, which few things can do for us nowadays. Even movies cannot make us happy, since we think of them only as catalysts for highfalutin and inflated intellectual writing a la Peter Travers. I did not need to write about this film because I did not feel the need to exploit it. But whatever.",Punch-Drunk Love

It was also the beststudy in contrasts I've ever seen on screen, pitting order vsdisorder in every frame.  Anderson crafted meticulous backdropsrich in color and whimsy, and his soundtrack was just as carefullychosen and complimented the visuals in an unusual and delightful fashion. Adam Sandler was highly believable as the volcanic brother ofseven sisters, and the choice of Emily Watson, with her pretty yetknowing face and attitude, was perfect casting.  This movie offeredthe funniest foreplay dialogue I've ever heard on screen.  Andabout those odd events in the beginning of the film?  Metaphors,folks.

390,GGSteven_93,A FUN ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT MIGHT PUT SOME OFF,8,17 January 2021,"The best way to sum this up is by saying that the film is a collage of stylistic choices from multiple genres that make the film feel uneven and frustrating at times. Though, this is what brings out the beauty of the film, as the camera work and style reflect the troubled mind of Adam Sandler's protagonist.In a way, the film is really similar to Sandler's later critical hit, Uncut Gems (2019) as there are plenty of hectic shots filled with lots of noises and background activity, which constantly build up the tension around the protagonist. One of the best aspects is when these moments of tension are released and lead up to either really comic or really tragic moments for the protagonist.Despite most of the times the camera being hectic, there are plenty of beautifully crafted images that are further enhanced by the lens flares and the use of soft focus. Though, one of the most striking shots comes from the Hawaii trip of Sandler, when the two protagonists embrace. As Watson and Sandler embrace, the two are completely covered in shadows as in the background the ocean is brightly lit by the sun. This composition creates a really strong contrast filled image. The image is so striking that it was actually used for the promotional poster too.Overall, the film might seem off putting for some, due to its hectic nature, but also due to its scarce plot at times. Nevertheless, there is plenty of fun to be had in the movie, as it is aided by strong performances from Sandler and Emily Watson and there is also quite a fun appearance from Philip Seymour Hoffman. If you ever get the chance, definitely check out the movie!Score: 8/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

Emily Watson fits her role perfectly and Paul Thomas Anderson is probably one of the best directors around. the music is abstract and bizarre at times but is in synch with the movie. once again Adam Sander why not do more such movies. this film is beautiful and is worth whatever running time it has",Punch-Drunk Love
392,todietotruth,A Commentary on Loneliness,9,21 December 2007,"What's made every great movie about romance great? In my mind, the realism of the interaction of the characters. That's why I like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind. Even out of the cheap romantic comedies, there are still some that work... Notably, in my mind, You've Got Mail actually works... Despite its absurd premise... The interactions between the characters are believable. Now, grant it, romance movies still have to work out better, most of the time, than our real life romances. If only for the reason that we don't watch movies to see other lame-ass individuals like ourselves screw everything up. But true character development and interaction is the only good reason, in my mind, to delve into a romance... Over say, an action film or something.That having been said. This is an exceptional piece of work. Not because of the ""romantic feeling"" this movie exudes... (The fact is, it exudes less than the average romantic film.) But because of the nature of Sandler's character. Never have I seen such a true to life portrayal of loneliness... Not horniness... But true loneliness... The disconnectedness of people who are truly lonely... The inability to understand ""normal"" ways of coping with life... The random lies one begins to tell for no apparent reason. Seemingly random emotional outbursts with no particular associations to reality.Well out performs Taxi Driver in my opinion as an accurate portrayal of human disaffection, loneliness, and emotional depravity... And yet, with a happy, romantic ending.",Punch-Drunk Love
393,Tamphex,Paul Thomas Anderson redeems Sandler's mileage,9,29 October 2007,"I find Sandler almost unwatchable in his ""comedies"". It takes no talent, comic or otherwise, to do the things he does in ""Gilmore"" or ""Madison"". 1998's ""Wedding Singer"" was a step in the right direction, but it wasn't until Sandler paired up with insane director Paul Thomas Anderson that the former's true talent was exposed to the public. As Barry Egan, Sandler embodies a character who is a psychological wreck, so beaten down by life and with so much bottled up inside that he makes Norman Bates seem extroverted. It's a stunning performance that reveals just how great an actor he can be when given the right material. Emily Watson is more than equal to Sandler as her heaven-sent, wide-eyed riddle of a character. Philip Seymour Hoffman also deserves a mention as a scene-stealing, sleazy mattress salesman. The cinematography is amazing, with impressive long takes that let the performers shine in their roles, and the use of sound and music is very intelligent and effective. So effective, in fact, that for the first half of the film it becomes quite painful to watch. You're not watching Barry from a distance - you're there with him, and you're manipulated by Anderson to feel what Barry feels. It's not the easiest film to watch, but don't worry - it does have a happy (not sappy) ending.A superb film, emotional, captivating and genuinely romantic, with Sandler's best performance to date. If you liked him in this, I must recommend 2003's criminally underrated Anger Management, where he plays a similarly subdued, repressed character. As for Punch-Drunk Love, it is easily one of the best post-2000 films, although it will leave the Big Daddy fans scratching their heads.",Punch-Drunk Love
394,jesusofchicago,"So much to like, so much to hate.",7,17 November 2002,"Often they were the same.  The music was both appropriate and irritating. This was one of the only movies that almost drove me from the theater.  I almost left 15 minutes into the movie.  It's grating, loud, incoherent, abstract, and depressing.  The protagonist (sandler) is so psychotic that it's really hard to feel for him in any way.  I found the audience was laughing at the moments I found most disturbing.  Maybe I didn't get the humor, but my honest impression is that there was no humor intended.  I think that people were expecting a laugh and grabbing the first available moment to do so. The strangest thing about this terrible movie... ...I think I liked it.  7/10",Punch-Drunk Love
395,chamarais,A Dreamy Real World Love Story,9,7 August 2008,"Well first of all this is not an Adam Sandler movie. Not a typical romantic comedy either. This movie is to romantic comedy what ""The Bourne Identity"" was to spy movies.Its about real people falling in love. Real weird people falling in love. Every incident looks believable. Most importantly nothing is excluded on the grounds that it may sound too weird. People say and do weird and or stupid things that makes sense to them and they do not do things out of character just to get laughs for the audience. Everything is natural and when the events are meant to be boring there are no attempts to spice up things here.The story has the feel of ""The Fisher King"" or ""Death At A Funeral"" but with some lullaby feeling.The really refreshing part is that this has some nice background music and the transition between some scenes are done with some effects as in that's 70's show that gives this movie a dreamy feel definitely similar to the end part of ""you got mail"". I just fell in love with this movie and Emily Watson after seeing this.Anyway this is not something to enjoy an evening with a bunch of friends.Its to be viewed alone or with some close company.If you see it with some friends there will be at least one who will find this to be boring and pointless.",Punch-Drunk Love

I forgot the golden rule of cinema-going: Never go and see an Adam Sandler film.Don't get me wrong, this film has a good story.  Barry, a weak lacking-in-confidence nerd, hen-pecked for life by his seven sisters, calls a phone sex line and then gets blackmailed and attacked by the owners of the sex line, after money.  At the same time, a work colleague of one of his sisters sees a photo of him and goes out of her way to meet him.  He's strange, but they start a relationship, probably the first Barry has had.However, that's the only good thing about this film.  Sandler is in this role, as always, very bad and even those that you expect to be better, such as Emily Watson, are let down by a bad script.Don't bother.

When we meet his family you suddenly get a clearer picture. The Barry character is very determined in his own way and this made me stick with the movie, His obsessions with buy something to get free things, I loved the way he fell in love, how it gave him so much strength he became super human.

399,Philip_Pugh,Just Desserts,10,30 November 2003,"In his previous two movies Paul Thomas Anderson had a whole cast of geniusly devised and underused characters all playing against and/or off one another making huge ensemble  masterpieces. Here he takes just one genius character creation, Barry Egan (played by Adam Sandler) and gives him his own 90 minute film. With Boogie Nights and Magnolia both about 3 hours long each, 90 minutes seems a little short for this director, but this movie is, like I said, mainly about one character. However the 90 minutes doesn't seem quite long enough. Like PTA's other characters in previous films, he doesn't exhaust their potential and leaves plenty of room making you wish for more, which unfortunately you don't get (although there are a couple of inspired deleted scenes on the DVD). The 90 minutes quickly slips by as we follow the incredibly shy and somewhat repressed business man Barry Egan as he deals with his verbally bullying sisters, a phone sex girl hell bent on getting money out of him and Emily Watson's character, a friend of one of his (seven) sisters who shows a lot of interest in him (She's even stalking him at the supermarket if you look closely). The repetitive, hypnotic soundtrack, bright paint like visuals, blue light lens flare, hilarious performances and superb direction adds stacks of style and mystery to this little gem ensuring you'll want to give it a second viewing. This film is absolutely brilliant and proves once again what a fantastic and intelligent writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is. But the best and most surprising turn comes from Adam Sandler who proves there's a lot more to his acting talents than childish, goofy, layabout, slap-stick comedy type characters he's become accustomed to playing. 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love
400,shirlty56,Weird and wonderful,7,10 January 2004,Punch Drunk Love won at Cannes and I can see why. Adam Sandler plays a role that is so different from anything he has played before. There are so many parts in the film when you don't know whether to laugh or cry. His sense of frustration with his life is so extreme because of his normal lack of emotion then he erupts into uncontrolled anger. It is the most interesting American film I have seen in a very long time. A strange yet rewarding experience.,Punch-Drunk Love

402,SinsOfArcadia,"""...So here we go...""",10,27 August 2007,"Punch-Drunk Love | 10/10 After a few viewings over the course of five years, I've come to realize that this is one of the most unique films I've ever seen. Surely that alone does not make it a good film, but I think it's worth mentioning because of how well it works. The synopsis of the film is utterly ridiculous, Adam Sandler is the most incomprehensible choice for something with any artistic value whatsoever, and the overall look of most scenes could quite easily annoy a person to no end. Luckily for me, I see no problem with any of this. Within the realm of what actually happens in this picture, the plot is necessary, Sandler is perfect, and the cinematography is astonishing. These things alone only touch the surface of what's presented over the course of an hour and a half.Director Paul Thomas Anderson already had a couple of great films behind him before he decided on this project. These films, however, were ensemble pieces and very much epic in scale. He proves here that he can be just as (if not more) effective with a few strong characters and a toned-down yet equally interesting vision. Sandler's Barry Egan is quiet, reserved, lonely, and clearly depressed with his seemingly empty life. He is a -real- character that some of us may have known at least once in our lives, and more importantly, one that even more of us can relate to whether we'd like to admit it or not. Anderson surrounds his character with various clues, both visual and spoken, that show us who he is, the person he would like to be, and what he may need in his life to achieve such things. Thus we're presented with one of the great actresses working today, Emily Watson. After an early morning car crash and an equally random (or not) appearance of a Harmonium, Watson's Lena walks into Barry's life. She, to a certain extent, is also reserved, and almost seems a bit too perfect to be real, or at least from around here (""People are just crazy in this world, I think.""). That line, as dormant as it sounds, speaks a great deal to me about her character and the possibilities that exist within it. She says this after Barry is attacked by the brothers of Mattress Man, the bogus phone-sex company that Barry calls during a routine moment of lonely desperation.As cliché as it may sound, I really do think that the basic motive for this film's existence is a desire to show the power of love and acceptance. Where it succeeds is it's flawless presentation. At the beginning of this film, Barry doesn't like the person that he is and really sees no reason for even trying to meet someone new. He is almost content with his small business and obsessive discovery of a marketing mistake that no normal person would even have the desire to uncover. As we see him playing his once silent and broken Harmonium, it's connection with his own heart and soul becomes clear.Regardless of how much you like this film, or if you like it at all, it is not one that can be turned off and forgotten immediately. In fact for those that are willing, there are quite a few layers that become apparent only through multiple viewings. For instance, pay attention to the appearance of a lady in red during Barry's first trip to the supermarket, and how during many scenes we're given an otherworldly visual description of what would seem to be otherwise normal environments. If you're not interested in such things, then I'd still suggest watching this for entertainment purposes alone. As much as I find myself complaining about mainstream cinema, I almost take comfort in knowing that I'll eventually come across something this perfect in a sea of uninspired mediocrity.",Punch-Drunk Love

I was close to turning it off multiple times, but thought, no, I will give it another chance, maybe there is a good payoff in the end. Not only was I wrong, but there was practically no end at all. It was the same inadequate, tedious tripe that the rest of the film was made of. Do not waste your time, because that is all it was to me.I feel almost as if I have been wronged by the people that made this movie, that is how incredibly bad it is.

But the story comes off as so completely stupid it can't hold your attention.  Sandler's character is not operating at a functional level of sanity and yet he runs his own business?  This woman holds a seemingly important job and yet has no problems with Sandler's complete loss of grip on reality?  It's not funny; it's just dumb.Next, the music was at times unbearable.  Clangs and beeps?  WTF?  It was just pseudo-modern tripe.The cinematography was beyond pretentious.  If Anderson wants to experiment with what opening up the aperture all the way will do for glare and wash-out, he'd save the studio a lot of money by just taking an old Super-8 out into the backyard.  It has its place for certain scenes in certain movies, but he does it throughout this movie despite the fact that it wouldn't work for a single scene.The actors all gave good performances, however they were crippled by all of Anderson's pretentious BS.If there was any art to be had, one might say that Anderson's ability to dupe those of us who saw this into paying money to do so (theater, HBO, video, etc) was some sort of meta/post-modern example of our own pretention, but I don't think he's smart enough for that.2 out of 10",Punch-Drunk Love
405,nevenbartel,What a love story,9,2 June 2003,This is probably one of the better films of last year. Adam Sandler has grown up and plays wonderfully in this love story which goes around any touchy-feely smooch-smooch.Don't expect pretty woman and sure do not expect happy gilmore. You will get non of these. What will you get?

406,killergawp,Brilliant Film,9,22 January 2003,"I saw Punch Drunk Love at its second screening at the Toronto International Film festival.  The idea that Adam Sandlar was starring in a film where he was require to play a dramatic role, piqued my interest, in fact it darn right had me intrigued.  So I sat down in a really uncomfortable seat at the Elgin and Winter Garden Theater, and loved every minute of it. Unlike, Magnolia, Punch Drunk Love runs at a brisk 90 minutes, but it still runs like a snail. It's the kind of film that keeps you wondering, because as you stare at luminous images that pass by your eyes, you wonder is there more to this? Am I missing something? There is no doubt in my mind that this film has many, many, many layers of metaphors and hidden meanings, that you can't see in one watch.  Paul Thomas Anderson does an superb job of writing and directing something that I have never seen before, an independent spirited and experimental film with a lot of heart, done right inside the Hollywood system. It has the greatest ending line of any movie I have seen this year, but I won't spoil it.  Adam Sandlar made me cry, a tall order for a guy who has only been able to make me laugh sometimes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman does an amazing job here, proving once more that he is one of the best character actors around today.  So long and thanks for this film!",Punch-Drunk Love

408,mclane-4,"Probably Sandler's best, but still a piece of crap",4,28 April 2005,"I've seen the film with great expectations. I honestly don't think Adam Sandler is a talented actor (neither are Jim Carrey, Jack Black, Aston Kutcher or Ben Stiller) but after reading all those delightful comments eventually I gave it a chance. Well... I shouldn't have.It's a new trend in Hollywood that directors with certain artistic ambitions are making film about ordinary people instead of heroes like they do in mainstream scripts. But they - especially the Andersons: Paul Thomas and Wes - mistaking ordinary people with losers. A funny accent will not make a character genuine, neither do its unrealistic weaknesses like spontaneous aggression, lying mania or tendency to cry in front of a crowd.But the message is clear: even losers get the blues. Namely if they find someone who accept them (sometimes even bigger losers - Emily Watson not included) they can become real everyday heroes and get rid of their annoying habits and characteristics. Well it's ain't bad moral, but these films miss the point. Sometimes even the target. I strongly recommend to watch As Good As It Gets instead - a really heartwarming romantic comedy with a great script, plausible characters, and excellent performances by the actors.I found the music of Punc-Drunk Love very disturbing most of the time. I guess it was the intention of the filmmakers but I didn't get the message out of it. Anyway if there had been such a message the music is still quite annoying.The movie has its good points though. The family dinner is a good scene just like Sandlers encounters with the band of blonds. On the other hand, I didn't find Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as great as other comments did, since he was bound to his unrealistic character. And the piano plot was merely a dead end - but hey, that's just me! The running time of 95 minutes was carefully chosen, and it's a great step especially from director Paul Thomas Anderson.All things concluded the movie is average. It's far better than a standard Adam Sandler movie, but don't let other comments fool you. It's not that good.4 out of 10",Punch-Drunk Love
409,DanielleMyBelle,Beautiful and simple.,10,26 December 2002,"I have been perusing the comments for this film for about a half and hour and I thought I would just throw in my two cents. I adored this movie. I think the most compelling and wonderful aspects of it were its purity and fragility. I watched on the edge of my seat, feeling deep compassion for Barry (played, as you have probably heard, wonderfully by Adam Sandler) and pulling for him to come through and achieve some semblance of long-overdue happiness. Emily Watson, as Lena, doubles this sense of purity in her role as the only truly good person in Barry's world. Not to be forgotten, of course, is the always brilliant Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the boss of a phone sex business trying as one of many forces to bring Barry down. The direction and writing in this film are also just stunning. The color implemented throughout works to set a tone and the slightly off music compliments it perfectly. I can see how this movie is not for everyone, but if you are the type of person who enjoys a movie that takes chances and uses abstract concepts to convey purely human ideals with both complexity and simplicity, you might enjoy this film as much as I did. On the other hand, if you are a fan of Sandler's early work, I beg you not to use that as a reason for catching this movie. It is so far removed from Billy Madison it is practically in a separate galaxy. 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love

There was absolutely no electricity between Sandler and Watson, and no possible clue as to what would draw her to him. If this film had been made by Joe Bloggs, firstly, it would never have been made, and secondly, it would have been trashed. Instead, insecure cineastes struggle desperately to find merit in this disaster, presuming that if they don't get it, they're the ones lacking. (Much like the nuts who like Eyes Wide Shut).

412,hopffgarten,Everyman as harmonium ... in blue,10,30 October 2002,"A lush and sensory stimulating setting to feature Adam Sandler's unexpectedly strong acting.

Where Anderson let his powerful script and great acting drive Magnolia, he lets the surreal perceptions of Barry Egan create a squishy sort of warp-and-woof from which Sandler springs.  Emily Watson is delightful, the bits with ""Healthy Choice"" hysterical, and the movie's most memorable line--""business is food""--on its way to the portmanteau hall of fame.Another great film from PT Anderson destined to live longer on the bulletin boards than suburban cinemas ... a pity, too.

413,patricktday,A False Promise,6,21 August 2021,"Punch-Drunk Love is an interesting film whose central premise doesn't live up to its intensely emotional title.The character of Barry is an incredibly interesting one, and does wonders in terms of evoking sympathy as well as empathy. Adam Sandler's acting in this film is also amongst his best. Barry's large group of sisters bully him to the point of him feeling like more of an outsider than he could've been, or ends up being, until he finds a woman who he falls in love with, and his confidence and power are restored. The only problem is, this plot is vastly under-developed.Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character has all of three scenes which establish him to be ""angry man who wants money"" and not much past that. While the man's acting can never be insulted, the character is far from good, and even more unbelievable is how his story is resolved. He sends men after Barry to attack and take money from him, displaying a willingness to commit multiple crimes, and then towards the end all Barry has to do is say ""Hey, cut that out!"" And he stops.Presumably PSH's character took Barry's weakness for granted, and didn't see his strength as being worth the struggle, and in this way the film attempts to showcase how love has changed Barry - but in doing so, it compromises the believability of what could be considered the ""antagonist"". For one, why would a man who is involved in crime expect no resistance at all? Even from a man like Barry, it seems doubtful that someone would disengage from conspicuous showcases of ordered violent crime out of respect for someone's bravado later on. Second, what did his character even want? Of course, to exploit Barry, but for what purpose besides money? And at least, why does he want that money? These are questions the film never answers.If all that matters is the love of the film, you know, the main love interest, then fine, cast these comments about all else aside and let us focus on the main love. A character who, shortly after watching the film, I cannot remember the name of, and is so hilariously idyllic and one-dimensional that the film feels like it's happening inside Barry's own head. She displays nothing but interest for Barry, continuously, and their relationship involves nothing but flat, boring remarks about liking one another, and an interesting dynamic between the characters is instead replaced by off-kilter yet one-note flirting. Perhaps this is the euphoria of their early relationship but even then, the scenes involving the two feel like a false promise; it acts as though there is something better, more grand behind the curtain waiting to be revealed, and yet all there ever is happens to be more idealism. Even at the end, where a decent ending would have been for the woman to reject Barry for leaving her in the hospital - she just accepts him, barely listening to his explanation before embracing him again. It feels quite deflated, and the two never seem to talk about anything seriously and their scenes play like a ten year old's imagined first dates.The direction and camera work is good, but not nearly on par with Paul's other works. There are more than a few scenes of the film which feature lens flare so abhorrent that it actively inhibits the importance of the dialogue from occurring to the viewer as they can't even see the characters' faces. However, it is a mixed bag, as soon after one of these instances there is a great section in the middle which is deliberately overwhelming (due to the direction) in order to illustrate Barry's inability to escape disaster and his sisters' abuse.The soundtrack is of a more consistent quality though, often doing wonders in serving the tension or enhancing the joy of the action within a scene.The film is by no means poor - Barry's character is a genuinely interesting one, and one I found myself attached to almost immediately. I felt sorry for him, I felt his want for escape, his sadness and his anxiety and torment stemming from his sisters.When the film ended, I felt partly glad for him, but on the whole, a lot of the other characters feel either under-developed or unimportant to an almost indiscernible premise, a lot of the time operating as background noise to fuel the struggle of a character whose conclusion is far from the satisfying end it could've been had these roles been better written. It's as though the picture is as lost as its protagonist, wanting something for itself that it can hardly attain, and in this state its story of love feels half-hearted and lacking in the dynamic one might think of with such an extreme title as Punch-Drunk Love.",Punch-Drunk Love

416,vidalsdauphin,One of the best films to come out of Hollywood...EVER!,10,17 December 2003,"I love everything about Punch-Drunk Love.  The visuals, soundtrack, cast (and their performances) and the realistic pacing make PDL my favorite Romantic Comedy.  Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a man that has serious social problems, who owns his own buisness selling novelty plungers.  One day, feeling down, he calls a phone sex company simply to have someone to talk to.  The next morning the woman calls back and asks Barry for money, Barry said no and from then on Barry is at odds with the Dean Trumbell (Philip Seymour Hoffman).  During this whole thing Barry meets Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), and falls in love.  All of this ties together and at the end you have one of the best films of the decade.  One thing I want to say is that each and every character is amazing.  People say how Barry is the most unrealistic guy ever and wonder how Lena could love him.  Well I believe that Barry is meant to represent the social problems EVERYBODY goes through one time or another in life.  7 sisters who constantly rag him, people who take advantage of his good nature (the phone sex company) and without the ability to express his anger (probably due to his sisters) he has outbursts of violence, and I found myself felling sorry for him, even when he was beating the living **** out of a resturant bathroom.",Punch-Drunk Love
417,displacedbeatnik,This Movie Isn't Going To Make Sense If You View It Under Normal Rules,8,15 July 2003,"""Punch Drunk Love"" is the greatest ensemble character piece ever made with just one character.  There are other characters in the movie beside Adam Sandler's Barry Egan, of course.  However, the reason a lot of people don't understand why they're there is because it's not important that they're there.  What's important is that they affect Sandler's character in certain ways.For example, so many people who have reviewed it question what the first scene with the piano meant and why it was in the movie.  But, if you look at how it effects him, not at all, the scene makes sense.  Most ordinary people would have freaked out and called the police about the occurrence.  But, Sandler's character just wants to be left alone in his world.  Taking the piano in finally is his opening his heart to the outside world like he does with Emily Watson in the movie.The story is so great because its so understated, just like Sandler's character.  The story is disquieting on quite a few levels, but I for one never felt overwhelmed because it's a slow build.  All of the plotlines are fascinating and do not take the turns you think they will.  The dialogue is not memorable, but it's real.This one man show plays well with me, but I can see how people can hate it. Any movie which throws every convention of movie making out the window is great in my book.  8/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

Their lives had led to the moment in which they will be in a PTA film, in this particular case it was Adam Sandler. What a performance! Seriously. Many of those who have analyzed this film have stated that he's essentially taken the man- child he's typecast himself into and brought it into the real world.

I always give a movie a fair chance at analysis. But this is by far the most terrible screenwriting I have ever seen in a film, this is the worst movie I have ever rated, a dismal two stars in my opinion. It is my opinion that the acting of Adam Sandler was actually not too bad, but the story is so over the top and makes absolutely no sense. In my eyes, this is the story of two severely mentally ill people who become attached to eachother solely as a direct result of their issues. The movie portrays a sense of anxiety very well, but I'm willing to wager that the major part of the anxiety (for me) was about how the story was so over the top and unrealistic. The worst part for me was the fact that the concept was interesting but the story just fell through. I see other reviews praising the portral of supposed ""social anxiety"" when in reality, the plot is so fantastical I am amazing anyone can relate to this at all. Finally, I think the most important reason why I think this movie is awful, is because it completely glaises over the fact that many of the characters suffer from SEVERE mental illness and the ending tries to pass it off as a ""whatever they're in love"" type cliche ending.",Punch-Drunk Love

There's a lot to love in this film, and may be too ""different"" for some people used to cookie cutter Hollyweird love stories. I adore it for the moments of complexity it shows between people. Sandler's character is human and endearing. I love how the movie uses music and people's loneliness and vulnerability to show how a man turns from a mouse into a lion. And Watson is just lovely and amazing. It shows how dangerous the world can be and yet how love - fragile yet real - just might save us all. A gem.",Punch-Drunk Love
421,swaindominic,Mesmerizing,9,15 March 2008,"I have just seen Punch Drunk Love and I am still reeling from it. Watching this film is totally intoxicating as the sights, sounds and atmosphere literally swamp your mind and leave you feeling bemused and on edge - but yet satisfied. We often hear the phrase ""jaw-dropping"", well at several points in the film I was deeply amazed and found myself so engrossed and stunned by the film that I think I was gazing on with my mouth widening in suspense and delight.Visually this is one of the best pieces of art I have ever seen, of course it is a film but the cinematography, the direction, and the musical score make this a sensory masterpiece. I was engulfed at times and there was so much going on in the film that I couldn't often pinpoint where it was coming from. I was very prepared to watch it again straight afterwards but I have decided to give it more time to sink in.P T Anderson is a complete master of film-making, we can add this to Magnolia, Boogie Nights and the recently released There Will Be Blood to name his most famous films which are all incredible in their own right. This is much more in the style of There Will Be Blood, and although it is different in subtle ways the psychological impact Punch Drunk love has is very similar. We also find the musical score being used throughout the film to add emotion, tension and edginess - this is perfected in a way that I can't recall from many other films. The soundtrack feels almost out of place at times, maybe overbearing but it is adding an extra layer of emotion that begins to burrow down in to your subconscious (that is to say that as a viewer it is not immediately apparent the effect it is having on you). I don't mean this to sound as it the score is intrusive - I think it is an amazingly effective technique to make you almost ""feel"" the film rather than observe it.Adam Sandler is not departing too widely from previous roles because he is playing a socially inept outcast with anger problems, but he is wonderful here and fits the role perfectly. Emily Watson brings an equally nuanced performance which further enhances the richly odd but beautiful flow to this unique film experience.I will readily admit that many people are going to find this jarring, lacking in storyline or just plain odd - I think that with this kind of art you either love it or hate it. I was totally blown away by this film and I am annoyed that I didn't see it until almost 6 years after its release.I cannot recommend this film highly enough, I haven't been so impressed by the technique, craft and ingenuity of film making for quite some time. Punch Drunk Love is a film that can easily overwhelm your senses and as the credits roll you may feel totally drained and bewildered - but wanting more. A real masterpiece.",Punch-Drunk Love

He does, but he also does strange, interesting, puzzling and sweet things as well. Sandler is actually acting, actually portraying someone other than Adam Sandler and he is great. Concise is a word others use to describe the story, direction and movie time, and I can agree with that. There is nary a wasted moment to be had. The writing is great, with nuanced and sophisticated dialogue that shapes complex characters with only a few sentences. Brief exchanges in dialogue build more complex and interesting characters than some movies do in hours. This film has depth and it is very surprising and satisfying.

Emily Watson, is as usual, brilliant, as his love interest.  Those mischievous eyes never quite let you know what's going on in her head.  The plot starts out fairly simply - a young man beleaguered by seven domineering sisters has an incredible rage simmering below the surface and is also very lonely.  Along comes Emily Watson, who seems so empathetic almost immediately and a relationship begins.  There are a few scary/hilarious plot twists that add to the tension and completely work. My only complaint is the soundtrack, which I think was a little grating and designed to create additional tension, but just served to annoy!  Other than that - a definite must - especially for those who can't imagine Adam Sandler in this type of role!

429,JHollis,Outstanding,10,27 February 2003,"How rarely do we see romantic comedies  where we can truly empathise with the feelings of both leads? How rare is it for us to see a romantic comedy where we do not know how things will end after 5 minutes. Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a film that is littered with hilarious moments and is more romantic than a thousand ""She's All Thats"". With this film Adam Sandler proves he can really act. In many ways he plays the stock Adam Sandler character - quiet, shy, prone to sudden and uncontrollable fits of violence - but the effect is both more subtle and actually funnier than in his previous films.Much has been made of Anderson's stated decision to make a short film. Well he does it the right way. Punch Drunk Love concentrates wholeheartedly on the 2 leads and so the supporting characters are just that. They are shown because they exert some influence on the lives of the leads.

All I can think is that the posters are sitcom types who don't open books too often and never stopped to think about their own emotions.  But that's beside the point.  This movie is just incredible and so true to life.  Anyone can relate to Barry (though his emotions are exaggerated).  He is an innocent, naive man living in a cruel world, and everyone around him (except his sweet coworkers) has bombarded him with abuse and thoughtlessness his whole life. His sisters are the bitchiest bunch of harpies imaginable.  Barry's explosions of frustration are (almost) warranted, as they're his only outlet.  He has nobody to turn to, as he tells the dentist.  Then, just as he's finally discovered a true love, the horrible phone sex people take advantage of him and threaten him, dropping a curtain of dread over him as well as the audience.  It's like when you have a really daunting task to complete and it ruins your weekend...you think, if I can just get rid of this and stop worrying, I'll be able to enjoy life.  That's how it is...this horrible nameless threat is constantly lurking around the corner, keeping Barry from the immense happiness he's discovered.  That's what was so great about the ""that's that"" scene.  Wouldn't we all love to be able to confront an issue that bothers us like this?  The phone booth scene with the sister had people cheering too...finally Barry stood up for himself!  This movie had the most intense emotions since ""Das Experiment"" that I've seen on screen.  Sandler was amazing, and I agree that he deserves an Oscar. Definitely.  This movie ROCKED.",Punch-Drunk Love

Pop quiz, hot shot: What does Adam Sandler stand for in our society? (pause) Idiocy. (pause) Stupidity. (pause) Success? How can he translate that style, that success into respect? We all deserve respect, even the clowns. Lest us not forget that screen icons like Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Robin Williams and Jack Lemmon were all once silly little comedic actors just like Sandler. Jim Carrey, and other comedians like Sandler are trying to stand up and proudly proclaim: YES I AM FUNNY. BUT THERE IS SO MUCH MORE! (pause) But has Adam succeeded in his attempt at a well made movie? YES! So much so, that I say that Punch-Drunk Love is the best film of the year.

AWARDS I. 2 Awards at the Cannes (Kahn) Film Festival II. Early Predictions for Academy Awards (particularly for Screenplay)III. But when you watch this, and I recommend it, DO NOT EXPECT SANDLER TO SHOW SOME SORT OF INCREDIBLE RANGE. He plays his typical persona, which is good. You all know that Sandler- goofy, quiet, shy, violent outbursts of rage. RAGE I. In his films, Sandler typically draws laughs when he suddenly goes out and WHAM destroys something, hurts someone, says something rude. This is antisocial behavior. We know that-its funny, in an unsettling way. And for this, he has been critically despised. II. Jean Luc Godard, the French auteur, once said that the best way to criticize a film is to make another one in response. PT Anderson, the director of Punch-Drunk Love has taken this to heart and transformed Sandler's rage. His violent outbursts- are justified! Barry Egan, the character Sandler plays, is a damaged, hurt character. an onion, if you will. there are different layers people! We see why he reacts and how. His violence is not only funny, but touching, in a way. The abuse Barry has gone through is dehumanizing, and Anderson knows that. Sandler has been polished, refined, redeemed by Anderson, who wrote for Saturday Night Live to sharpen his comedy writing skills. III. Why is this such a big deal for Anderson and Sandler? Here is a great example: IV. Several years ago, Clint Eastwood, an aging action star directed Unforgiven, a western. This was the negation, and the accumulation of all the westerns ever made- spaghetti and Ford-Wayne and Martin. These westerns rarely won critical praise, and followed typical stereotypes. Eastwood took that and created something new, something that answered many questions about the Western. Anderson has done the same thing for Adam Sandler and his films. V. PT Anderson has called this and art house Adam Sandler film.TODAY'S FILMS I. Clocked at 89 minutes, and a romantic comedy, this is a far cry from Anderson's previously long, Altman-esq epics. Many compare Anderson to Robert Altman, and this film contains many references to Altman's cult classic Popeye. II. What is even more surprising is the age in which this film is released. In an age, of big special effects and too many storylines, Anderson has created something wonderful- something simple and sweet. Sandler epitomizes that, hence the film is carried on his performance- no one else could have pulled it off. Of course, it helped that Anderson wrote the part with Sandler in mind. III. From its' surreal opening to Barry and Lena kissing in dramatic sequence, with Shelly Duvall sings Harry Nilsson's `He Needs Me' in the background, you get a sense of what love is. If these two can find love, anyone can. IV. Lena is. practically perfect. She heals Barry's wounds. Played angelically by Emily Watson, you get a sense that Lena, who might not show it, needs Barry and is just as weird as him. That connection makes the film-it answers `Why does she like such a weirdo?'EVERYONE I. We are all weirdos! That's why! II. With films always trying to overdo it, Punch-Drunk Love succeeds in being minimal. It's message is clear, yet complex. Its metaphors are original, yet familiar. Barry is scary, yet harmless.And yes, *reviewers*... you can't simply call a film, or subplot, or character STUPID-- without justification... back your opinion up with intelligent thought...",Punch-Drunk Love
433,blaker22,***9/10***,10,30 October 2002,"This is a movie about the irrational mad rush of new love (or maybe infatuation?), and its redeeming/healing powers.  Not a terribly original concept, but very originally executed.I understand why people did not like this movie, and I don't even blame them.  It is quite hard to swallow.  I think a lot of people, seeing ""Adam Sandler"" on the bill, expected some sort of comedy, and that would pose a problem with this movie.  A lot of people who didn't like it said they weren't expecting ""just another Adam Sandler comedy,"" and I believe them. But I also believe that they were still expecting some sort of comedy. One guy even, after preempting his comments with the fact that he wasn't expecting another Sandler movie, went on to  complain that it wasn't funny, and that he didn't ""chuckle"" even once (seemingly forgetting his own preemptive comments). If you are expecting a comedy, you will not like it. It's not very funny, and the laughs that do come are nervous laughs, because you as an audience member have been made uncomfortable and don't know how else to react.That said, I am glad I was able to ""swallow"" this movie, I feel like I got an incredible amount out of the paltry (yes it seemed quite short to me) 90 minutes or so of screentime.  Even those who did not like it as a whole would have to admit that Adam Sandler was simply jaw-dropping in this role. And anyone who was not moved or touched by his genuine pain through most of the movie has a heart of stone.  I thought Emily Watson was stellar as well, but her character still remains somewhat of a nebula to me, so I want to reserve full comment on her until I can see it again and understand the character more fully.  I would like to reply to those who said that her falling for Barry was unbelievable/unrealistic.  My only response would be that love/attraction/infatuation is not always rational, so a ""normal"" girl like her actually might fall for some guy like Barry, recognizing his fundamental kindness and desire for trust/love.  Plus she originally became interested after seeing a picture of him, and Adam Sandler is not a terribly bad-looking guy.  Again, I find it believable.I have heard complaints of an ""underdone"" script.  I personally enjoy scripts that allow for more face time, I think they are more realistic. After all, in real life you don't have each person in a conversation saying exactly what is on their mind in the most poetic of fashions all the time. P.T. Anderson prefers to speak with his actors' faces rather than with words, and I find that approach incredibly refreshing.  Does anyone remember the 45-second close-up of Mark Wahlberg's face in ""Boogie Nights"" (when they're about to rip off the cokehead)?  I found it captivating, and Mark Wahlberg isn't even a good actor!  So imagine the results when he has capable actors like Sandler and Watson, and a script that is intended to elicit looks of torment and longing and (insert emotion here).  The script also excellently portrays the gradual building of Barry's tensions/problems up to the point of unbearability.  The way you see injustice upon injustice piled on top of him is almost painful.  You can recognize that he is basically a good guy who wants to be treated fairly and with respect, just as he tries to treat everyone else.Barry is definitely a character in the mold of Holden Caufield (""Catcher in the Rye"").  He speaks of phonies and only gets really angry when he perceives people disrespecting him or lying.  In the end, I guess I was so moved by this movie because I identify with Barry.  The world would be a much better place if everyone was like him.  I'm not talking about his inability to handle anger, but rather his devotion to the truth and common courtesy.At risk of coming off like a pretentious, you-only-hated-this-movie-because-you-didn't-""get""-it type of guy, I urge those who objected to the movie to see it again on video.  If you go into it not expecting a comedy but rather a beautiful, redemptive love story I am sure you will at least stop hating it.  Or you can not see it and continue hating it, it's only a movie after all. ;) Just my $.02",Punch-Drunk Love

437,Lu-Yi-Si,Truely awful!,1,1 January 2003,"Yuk yuk yuk. This film sucks, the whole storyline is putrid and stupid, because none of the characters seem to behave in a realistic manner. Sandler, an actor I usually avoid passionately was suggested by other user comments to be a worthy actor in this film, how wrong they are. His performance was bizarre and erratic and I had no understanding or sympathy for his character. The entire film's acting was wooden and wierd, making me feel very comfortable throughout. I really disliked the soundtrack and I sure one song during his time in Hawaii went on for, it seemed, ten minutes. I was relieved and happy when the film ended! In future I'll keep away from Sandler's films, as I'm not the type of person that likes to waste money on renting poor movies. Or wasting my time at the cinema. Avoid like the plague!",Punch-Drunk Love
438,quick_relief,Gorgeous,10,2 April 2004,"This is a very quirky film. I have never found better use for the word until now. Adam Sandler's performance really opened my eyes as he is truly amazing in this film and together with Emily Watson make the sweetest pair I have ever seen in a film.It is an intensely sweet and romantic feel-good movie that will haunt you long past the end credits. Some will hate the film for having no plot or drive in the classical sense, but those who can enjoy a movie without spoon-fed narration or an obvious plot bios, will love this film. The song titled 'He needs me' used near the end of the film can also be found in the movie Popeye and is sung by Olive oil - another awfully sweet couple, and encapsulates the heart of the film.If you are a single bloke and want to win over a bird, then invite her over and rent this movie out and I guarantee that if she has any brains, she will pleasure you.",Punch-Drunk Love
439,ILoveFilm1998,Punch-Drunk Love,9,31 July 2014,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a 2002 romantic comedy-drama film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson, with Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzmán also appear. The film is about a psychologically troubled novelty supplier is nudged towards a romance with an English woman, all the while being extorted by a phone-sex line run by a crooked mattress salesman, and purchasing stunning amounts of pudding.Now I was excited to watch ""Punch-Drunk Love"". Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my favorite directors working today, and none of his films thus far let me down. Plus, this is quite different from PTA normally does. Where other PTA films were epic in scale and storytelling, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" definitely goes for a much smaller scale, but that doesn't take away that this is an fantastic movie.Adam Sandler gives the performance of his career. He is not acting as a more dramatic version of himself, he is Barry Egan, who is one of the most fascinating characters I seen in a PTA film. Utilizing his comic persona to his full advantage, Sandler also adds a tragic element to that makes Barry both highly sympathetic, and relatable. It a shame that Sandler puts himself into films like ""Grown-Ups"", and ""Jack and Jill"", because when he is working with legit directors like PTA, he can became a revelation. Emily Watson is wonderful, bringing a great deal of sweetness to "" Punch-Drunk Love"", and has terrific chemistry with Sandler, and makes their eventual romantic relationship much more believable. In a small, but pivotal role, Philip Seymour Hoffman is delightful treat to watch as Dean Trumbell, a man trying to extort money from Barry.PTA as always, is brilliant in his direction. Both him, and Cinematographer Robert Elswit give this film a colorful tone and atmosphere not seen in his other films. Heck for films of the romantic comedy type, there are no other movies like it. Jon Perise score is also perfect for this film, and again, makes ""Punch-Drunk Love"" different from other films of it's type. PTA also does a great job of letting it's audience see the story from Barry point of view. When your film centers on a less than stable character, it makes sense for the film to feel like that as well, which PTA does masterfully.""Punch-Drunk Love"" is actually like Barry himself. It's odd, funny, playful, unpredictable, random, sad, joyful, and touching, which are terms that can be used to describe life, and love. Sometimes there doesn't have to be a reason for what happens in life or love. It comes around to you, and you decide what choices you make with it. Although that the main message I got form it, as what you may get form the film might be completely different.If there are any negatives, is that compare to other PTA films like ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""Magnolia"", it not as deep compare to those films. Unlike what I did with the first two film, I don't find myself going into as in depth with ""Punch-Drunk Love"", but that's probably the point of it. It's not trying to be ""There Will Be Blood(My favorite PTA film btw.) "", but it's own film and story altogether. And on that note, it's all the better for it.",Punch-Drunk Love
440,iagrmc,I don't know....,4,20 August 2020,".... what exactly it is I hated about this film so much. Anderson's film There Will Be Blood is one of my favorite films of all time. But holy lord, I despised this movie. Hated every single frame of it. I'm not one of those people who writes posts saying that every movie they dislike is a one out of ten and the worst movie ever. But dang, I hated this movie.",Punch-Drunk Love

This film although somehow manages to approach that subject in the most brilliant and most perfect way yet...Through vulnerability, rage, embarrassment, worry, style, crescendo of music. This film has it all, every beat is perfect, the casting, the set design, editing, pacing, screenplay, it's all there, and all a perfect blend of art house and realism which leaves us to be pulled into this surreal and emotive world. This film is completely immersive and consistently keeps you on the edge of your seat with its engrossing score.

442,superman_609,This was a very interesting movie.....,10,5 March 2006,"The first time I saw this film was when I received it as a present from out of the blue.It's not a well kept secret that I like Adam Sandler movies,but when it came to this one I was rather Sceptical about it.Mostly because I prefer his roles in comedy films,such as Billy Madison or Anger Management.The first few minutes of the movie to me,look like he is in the corner of a multi-story car park basement floor,when he's sitting at his desk. Then the next thing I thought was really stupid,was the fact he was phoning up a seemingly pointless phone call,which I don't really think anyone would make at that time of the morning.In the phone call he moves on to ask all of these very detailed questions.There were some unexpected laughs in it though.Like the party where he smashes the patio doors made out of glass,just because they keep calling him gay boy.It's amazing to think of a man's life and then try to think that it's controlled by seven other women,not that I'm being sexist or anything,it's not unusual to see the wife taken more control over household situations and people's lives in the household.I didn't think that Adam Sandler was brilliant in this though.The whole sex line chat did get a bit annoying after a while.And I've seen many an Adam Sandler film where he beats the living s**t out of the enemy in the story line,although he did handout a beating to the gang of hooligans who crashed into his car on purpose,and hurt his girlfriend (Watson).Overall,this was a brilliant attempt for Sandler,playing one of his first serious roles.The next most serious role he would play would be John Clasky,in Spanglish.I felt that,that movie was a much better attempt at being serious,and left a lot of comedy in it.this movie however was by far one of Sandler's best movies,I give it a 9/10 as a better estimate to my vote.",Punch-Drunk Love
443,georgepsoady,My favourite film,10,11 November 2018,"In my life, I have watched over 500 films. Ive seen comedies, dramas, horrors, war films, thrillers, musicals. Every time of film that has been made, chances are I've seen it. And yet, I have never seen one film that is quite like Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. I have seen this film over ten times now, and each time i'm blown away by how beautiful, uplifting and brilliant it is. Not only is it a visually intelligent and brilliant film, it also a very entertaining one and one you want to watch time and time again. It is a film where it seems that every aspect is beautifully crafted. From the music to the cinematography to the brilliant performances, it seems everything in this movie was planned and thought through. As well as being a brilliant film on its own terms, including being one of the best directed performances I've seen (from Sandler), one of my favourite scores and it's brilliant writing, it also important to me on a personal level.
Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I always feel so happy and joyous after the expierence. It is a film that makes me happy it exists, and makes me look at life in a different way. I have recommended this now to three of my friends, and I've had no complaints back. I love this film with my heart, and even thinking about it gets me exited.
One of my favourite aspects about this film is the performance from Sandler. I have never been a fan of Sandlers mainstream comedies (however The Wedding Singer has always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me) and I have always thought he is not a brilliant actor. But in this, he proves himself as a force to be reckoned with. If this was Adam Sandlers only film, he would be my favourite actor. Alongside Sandler, Emily Watson is great in a performance that manages to mix the idea of a dream girl with somewhat of a physcopath.
To be completely honest, I don't understand most of the imagery in this film, and to be honest, I don't want to. One of the reasons I love this film is because of its odd quirks, it's random things I will never understand.
It's such a beautifaul film, is my favourite film, and will be one I'll continue to watch for a long, long time.
Thank you P.T.A",Punch-Drunk Love
444,Dogwhiz,Paul Thomas Anderson gets Sandler to prove he can do drama too,7,15 August 2010,"After Magnolia and before There Will Be Blood, came Punch-Drunk Love in Paul Thomas Anderson's arsenal of movies. In this dark and odd romantic dramedy, Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, a childish adult man who is still shy around women and whose seven manipulative sisters criticize and torment him into uncontrolled bursts of anger. His wholesale plunger business keeps him busy, despite the fact that he never seems to do anything productive at his office. Rather, he spends his time exploiting a loophole in a special Healthy Choice promotion by buying large amounts of pudding in order to rack up millions of free frequent flyer miles that he has no specific use for (a story that is based off of that of ""Pudding Guy"" David Phillips). Boring and aimless as his life may be, Egan endures with only minimal broken glass windows and few crying episodes. However, all of that changes when an interested woman becomes intent on meeting him and a phone sex hotline operator becomes violently vengeful.Adam Sandler performs like you've never seen him before, and at the same time- just like you've always seen him. His natural childish persona is preserved, but instead of being channeled into awkwardly unfunny jokes that would more likely be heard in a middle school cafeteria, Paul Thomas Anderson finds a way to use Sandler's juvenile behavior powers for good. Together, the two create an air of loneliness and constant distress that manages to engage the audience and evoke a sense of sympathy for the protagonist. And with added exceptional performances from Philip Seymour Hoffman and Mary Lynn Rajskub, Punch Drunk Love is something that prevails in its own way.Admittedly, the movie's dream-like nature and unconventional quirkiness isn't quite for everyone and some might come away feeling as if they simply didn't get it. However, those who appreciate Paul Thomas Anderson's general quality of work and are curious to see a different side of Sandler's abilities will certainly be charmingly pleased. To give a fair evaluation, it's not particularly a film that most will love or hate. Moreover, it's simply a respectable piece of work that's well worth a viewing, at least for the experience that Anderson creates.",Punch-Drunk Love

448,redwards13,Don't blame the movie.,10,12 October 2002,"I'd like an explanation of what makes people think this movie is pretentious. Because it never pretends to be anything other than what it is, which is a simple, sweet love story. You didn't think it was funny, fine. You prefer to perceive everything you see in movies as having an unambiguous meaning, that's your prerogative. And if you don't like the fact that the movie asks you to experience it in the moment (the visuals are telling you to do that, not just acting pretty) without trying to figure out where the next poo joke's coming from, that's fine. Go watch something else. But don't blame the fact that you were expecting some hackish Sandler vehicle on anyone but yourself. (Not that there's anything wrong with hackish Sandler vehicles.)",Punch-Drunk Love
449,AlohaTad,What were they thinking??,1,10 November 2002,"What an irritating film - no doubt some people's lives are pathetic and they must endure incredible levels of hostility and meaninglessness - but I would rather not spend 80 plus minutes of my life to witness their angst to get one small kernel of redemption - Nor do i ever care to be jarred by intentionally irritating sounds - just to ""get it"" that some folks lives are unpleasant to the point of being crazy-making.yes i got that the family of harpies is unpleasant to the point one wants to punch things, that the mountain folks are in-bred freaks completely devoid of morals, that some women (and men) are so desperate that they will fall for - or settle for ANYONE that pays them a moments attention.Is there more to this film?? Surely we cant expect the redemption to come from a neurotic sociopath's vain attempt at true love?? Equating the tender caress of her face to violent longings?? Great stuff. Reputations of even paragons of the industry such as Anderson and Watson may barely endure such drivel.And as for Sandler - i have been mildly amused by a couple of his films, unappreciative of most - should i ever again read that he is being presented as a serious actor, I will know better than to resist my urges to walk out - after 5 minutes i was wondering what this film could possibly be about - after 10 minutes, I knew it was highly unlikely i could appreciate it, but man oh man - such a headache i wasnt expecting. Not even the lobby and terrace scenes at the Pink Palace could redeem this one for me - no swirl of pretty colors can alleviate the tediousness of this film. Would that it were about the life of the ""pudding man"" (a real live person) - that might have been more interesting. Some folks still thought it was a comedy as they laughed through his crying jags - guess we need a bigger hammer to hit them over the head with next time, P T.Instead, I would rather ride a city bus for 80 minutes, where for one buck, not nine, one can observe comparably unnerving levels of neuroticism, meaninglessness,violence, evil piranhas preying on innocent lambs, and messed up family dynamics in general and specific. But as an art form, or perhaps even to be passed off as entertainment, who needs it?",Punch-Drunk Love
450,the reach,"a wonderful yet uneven, absurdist romance",6,17 November 2002,"this film suffers from the same problems buffalo 66 did. both films have a fully self-absorbed, flared up male hero, who develops quite well into a believable, lovable guy. but, the female leads in both films have no depth! they maybe say about 7 banal lines.But... there are some scenes that are quite brilliant. in some ways like wong kar-wai's films. what i mean is like wong kar-wai,the choice of music here is astounding. it adds to the absurdity, indigestion of daily work. and the pops songs could'nt be more ironic. at times,it sounds like a lost raymond scott/john cage soundtrack.",Punch-Drunk Love
451,shueyo,Thank you PT Anderson,9,28 October 2002,"It's great to know that out there in Hollywood there are writer/directors who can do the kind of movie they want to do and not the kind of movies that producers want. I saw the film yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I went with 7 people to the movies, five of them thought it sucked (most of them thought legally blonde was great), anyway, I can totally understand that this movie is not for everyone, This is not your typical Hollywood movie, it's not entertaining all the time.PT Anderson, knows how to play with the rhythm of his movies, at times it's slow and there is nothing going on and 2 minutes later, everything changes the music, the editing, and it becomes and emotional ride. He want's to make you feel what Barry is feeling, the movie begins very slowly, and not much is going on, and that is a reflection of he's life outside work, 20 minutes into the movie, there is a scene where there is chaos all around him, and PT Anderson, with editing, music and sound creates a stressful scene for the audience, which I felt was superb , I really wanted for the scene to end because it was stressing me out.Another observation is that the role Adam Sandler plays is the same one in all his movies, a guy that is very nice, but has an anger problem, the only difference is that in this movie the show that character the way he would really be without all the dumb gags. If you think about it Barry is ""Waterboy"" in the real world. Mr. Anderson I hope you make another movie again soon.",Punch-Drunk Love
452,bzolt,Pleasant Surprise!,10,23 October 2002,"I think I liked this film the best of PT Anderson's films. It was such an unusual film, and never before had I seen a performance quite like Adam Sandler's. Not since Rainman or Forest Gump had I seen a character this frustrating and endearing at the same time. By the film's end, I found myself rooting for Sandler's oddball character. The film was also beautifully shot, and the story was so well written that I had no idea what was going to happen next. It's a nice film that leaves you thinking about it long after you've seen it.",Punch-Drunk Love
453,petzoid,highly overrated movie!!,6,28 June 2006,"To start this of I have to admit that i watched the movie in the (dubbed) German version which might be a reason why I could not catch on to this particular piece. One thing is for sure Adam Sandlers acting is superb although I cant understand why this one is supposed to be his best performance. I think he is way better in ""Click"" an even better in ""Spanglish"". If you are into good cinematography this should be your choice because it really has some great pictures in it. I personally disliked the psychedelic(very colorful)bits in between different scenes though-I guess thats a matter of personal taste. The whole story kind of has a slow pace and is in some parts utterly unrealistic (the telephone thing) and the Soundtrack is quite annoying from time to time.I think this supposed emphasize the Main Character's state of mind but I feel that it made the Movie hard to watch. I you want to watch a good movie of this Director go watch ""Boogie Nights""",Punch-Drunk Love
454,fandango1111,a really good movie indeed!,10,7 April 2008,"I love this movie! Everything about it is just excellent. I watched it twice in two days and loved it even more the second time round; the cinematography, the story, the dialogue, the music, the colours, the characters- everything here falls together in a divine harmony.It is a very positive movie and will make you feel good about us humans and our individuality, our feelings, love, our awkwardness, bizarreness, vulnerability, strengths and weaknesses, our life-struggle and finding our individual ways.I like the performances of all the actors: Sanders gets a portrait of a completely suppressed man, Emily Watson is adorable- I fell in love with her character completely by the end of the movie, the non-professional actors are perfect for this film, Seymour Hoffman makes his short appearances strong and memorable. This kind of movie is beyond my criticism and I'm sure will be loved more and more as the time passes by. This is one of my favourite movies of all times.",Punch-Drunk Love
455,be_leafer,thought-provoking movie - what IS it about??,7,15 November 2002,"I had read good reviews but was concerned it was just hype - do I want to waste my time watching usually-obnoxious Adam Sandler (Opera Man, folk singer, Water Boy, ad nauseam) do his witless schtick?Well, some friends said it was interesting, so...This is a thought-provoking movie - what IS it about??Why the truck crash at the beginning, the harmonium, the angelic woman, the ""unbreakable"" breaking toilet plungers, the pudding, etc?  It's something like a dream (the shifting, fantastical colours between scenes are reminiscent of just before wakening in a bright room or moving in and out of consciousness); or perhaps, an after-life experience - the proverbial white light; or something like Pee-wee's Big Adventure - little boy trying to find his way - who better than Adam Sandler? This isn't to be taken literally - mostly it reminds me of some of my weirder dreams (maybe it's time to re-read Carl Jung's dream symbolism book). Or, are they just putting us on?  I don't think so - it's about becoming conscious - seeing and being seen - I'm not sure they succeed, but it was interesting - not one of your laugh-out-loud comedies, but funny, in ways. I wonder how they're going to take this in France - is Sandler the new existential Jerry Lewis? That I gotta see!",Punch-Drunk Love

What?It's not that this movie is bad, it's just that it's not that good.  As always, P.T. Anderson is a good director, but that doesn't make up for the rest of the movie being nothing special.It has a few scattered funny moments, and Sandler certainly doesn't appear out of place.  It's more like a held back version of his characters. It's like Mr. Deeds on Ritolin or something.Emily Watson though, does seem out of places.  It's like, ""Look at me, I speak proper, fall for me for no other reason than that.""  Honestly, there's no other reasons than that.The supporting characters---nearly non-existent.There's three subplots, all of which are near meaningless besides filling up the movie for it's 90 minutes.It felt much more like a director's first movie than his fourth.

There were also these lame ""marijunia effects"" that have no significance in the movie.I also got pretty sick of 17 shots of Adam Sandler walking down a hall. Like every 10 minutes they would show a shot of Adam Sandler walking down a hallway. Personally the first whole hour of the movie was boring and there was nothing to follow. For example, there are aspects of the movie that are not explained.I am clueless as to why this movie is getting such a high rating. Everyone who walked out of the theatre did not like the movie. This movie was an ATTEMPT at art. Of course you'll find people who absolutely love this movie. However in my case, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

It's a film about loneliness and finding love when you don't expect it. Emily Watson manages the right balance between quirky and adorable and Adam Sandler convincingly plays it straight. You find yourself wanting to tell his sister's to give him a little space. My friends and I also had a bit of fun trying to guess what color his tie would be next. I found myself waiting to see what would happen next. I would go see it again. .......And if any of Adam's fans are growing up, then go see this film, you'll still laugh.",Punch-Drunk Love

460,helldriver,A P.T. Anderson/Adam Sandler-film,7,9 May 2003,"I first went to see Punch-Drunk Love on the premier-night here in Sweden. But after one hour or so the theatre was evacuated because of the smell of smoke. They were afraid there was a fire. So I got a ticket back with 6 month-expiration-date. Tonight I went to see it again with the very same ticket.The first time, I liked what I saw, with the exception of Emily Watson. Her character weren't suitable for the film. Or maybe she wasn't suitable for the part. I don't know, but I felt the same way about it this time.   Steven Soderbergh's and P.T. Anderson's favorite(?) Luis Guzman (The Limey, Carlito's Way) is as always satisfying. He can make a face expression and falling off a chair funny. But in the same way as in Anderson's masterpiece Boogie Nights you don't really know wheter to laugh or not. Dirk Diggler's funny/not funny decay is here represented by Adam Sandler's character and his troubles.I chose not to laugh that often. The film works good as a drama. I got this weird feeling in my stomach a couple of times. You really feel with Sandler's Barry Egan who gets ripped of by some Phone Sex-operators, buys pudding, plays harmonium and gets bullied by his seven(!) sisters.Anderson has got many good ideas. I like the way he uses the light in Punch-Drunk Love, he has as before also made up pretty unique stories and characters. It's a mix of fun and tragic with great music often present. It's also more of a rom-com than his previous films Magnolia and Boogie Nights, two films I liked very much. I also liked Punch-Drunk Love very much, the originality, Adam Sandler's effort, but not Emily Watson's or the casting person's when he/she chose Watson. Punch-Drunk Love is almost up there with The Wedding Singer, perhaps the best romantic comedy I've ever seen, also starring Adam Sandler. If you call The Wedding Singer a Adam Sandler-film. Punch-Drunk Love is a P.T. Anderson-film, and a little less a Adam Sandler-film.",Punch-Drunk Love
461,tjc78,"the train of PTA rolls on, some just don't get it.",10,30 October 2002,"Leave your logic at the door, and try and persuade me that your reasoning is better than mine. The whole movie is about flight. The frequent flier miles are symbolic of a man wanting to take off. Egan is looking for something better, without knowing what bounces around in his head. Egan knows he wants to escape, sometimes maybe he just doesn't know how to go about doing it. Then, he meets Lena, and his mind is set, and runway prepared. Nevermind that her character is underwritten, just accept in this surreal fantasy of a dream, that, THIS, love is simple. Like great love stories of the past, or just simply a movie you lose yourself in, Anderson succeeds in taking you away from your daily reality;  for isn't that what the movies are about? And does anyone do it better than Anderson today?  I think not. Life is like a tunnel, or should I say like an apartment hallway. Barry flies through looking for a runway to land on. Sometimes he crashes through glass, and sometimes he lands in Lena's arms. The second he comes more accustomed too, and greatfully so. He first learns to fly to Hawaii, directly into Lena's sweetness, and it is like a boy boisterous with his ball. It is fanasy, it is escape, it is flight away from everyday. Barry, as the director shows, will take it, and take it well. As he says simply, ""Thats that,"" in response too Dean's opposite of the coin betraying lust. Is it love vs. lust, or is it just fantasy meant to take you away. I prefer the second, with music and color art, Anderson transcends any modern film by merging all art forms. In the end Lena proclaims, ""here we go,"" as Barry and Lena take flight. That's that. May the flight go well. 10 of 10.",Punch-Drunk Love

463,pbarrrgh8617,the best of 2002,10,27 February 2003,"this movie is, quite simply, astounding. everything about it is very refreshing and original and it never once resorts to the hackneyed and trite.if you are not already familiar with the plot, it goes, very simply, like this: barry egan is a lonely, harassed, custom toilet plunger salesman. one day he is introduced to a mysterious woman named lena by one of his many nagging sisters.  the film follows barry as he discovers love with lena. there are, also, two smaller subplots involving a phone-sex scam and a harmonium, but i dont want to give away anything so i wont say more.all the performances in this movie are astounding. a lot of people have been going around saying that they always knew adam sandler was a great actor and now they have been proven right. personally, i had no clue. i always knew he was a comedic genius, but i was never able to envision him doing well with anything the least bit dramatic, which punch-drunk love undoubtedly is despite its many comedic moments.  not only does adam sandler turn in an oscar-worthy performance, but we get stellar supporting performances from emily watson as lena, and a small but spectacular role from phillip seymour hoffman as the perpetrator of the phone-sex scam in which barry becomes entangled.another wonderful thing about this movie is the music and score. a lot of people have been ridiculing the song ""he needs me."" their ridicule is, well, ridiculous.  this is an offbeat movie about an offbeat man falling in love with an offbeat woman. i cannot imagine a more wonderously offbeat song to end the movie.  the score, too, has been criticized.  this is also very sad. this is the most original score i have heard in ages and is actually fascinating, by itself, to listen to.and finally we come to the much-discussed, and often insulted, flashes of color in between certain scenes. some go so far as to suggest that this is nothing more than ""pretension"" and a pitiful attempt at the surreal"" on the part of paul thomas anderson. i would ask these people, kindly mind you, to please lighten the hell up. so what if there was no purpose to color in between scenes? (i think that there was, but that another story and still open to debate) they are fun to watch even without their deeper meaning so just sit back, relax, and stop trying to nit-pick a fantastic film.punch-drunk love is undoubtedly the best film of 2002, go see it now. 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love
464,JonesGambino,"Sandler's Best, By Far, Another Great for Anderson",10,16 December 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a legend in the making. Boogie Nights and Magnolia are two of the best films of the 90's. When it was announced that he was developing a project specifically for Adam Sandler, all the speculation of greatness turned to speculation of Anderson's demise. This was Adam Sandler, the Adam Sandler from such classics like The Waterboy. Why would Paul Thomas Anderson kill his career like this?That's the game PT Anderson plays. He is the most daring and ambitious filmmaker in Hollywood. After Boogie Nights, PT Anderson could do anything, and Magnolia was released. Three hours of depressing vignettes following the lives of various people populating the San Fernando valley- capped off with a frog storm. Tom Cruise pulled off the performance of his career in the process. The movie was a critical hit, and Anderson's risk paid off. Although lightweight in execution by Boogie Nights and Magnolia standards, by casting Adam Sandler in the lead role, PT Anderson has surpassed any of his previous risks by leaps and bounds.Adam Sandler plays Barry Egan, an owner of a small business that sells novelty toilet plungers. Years of bullying from Barry's seven sisters has left him with a social anxiety and severe lack of confidence in himself. He lashes out violently when reminded of certain events during his childhood. Barry is lonely, when asked by one of his sisters if he'd be interested in meeting Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) he responds, `Nah, I don't do that kind of thing.' Lena is all for Barry though, no matter how weird their meetings turn out, she waits, and will always wait for him to come around.
The love story between Barry and Lena is simple, but the circumstances that put a strain on their relationship makes the film. On a night before he met Lena, Barry called a phone sex line just looking for someone to talk to. Weeks later, he finds himself being extorted and physically threatened by the sleazy owner of the company played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (PT Anderson regular and the best supporting actor in film today). Another plot point centers on Barry exploiting a loophole in a pudding promotion for free frequent flier miles. It should go without saying that this story arc is very off beat, but the end result is a very original romantic comedy.
While all of the performances are spectacular, the attention is on Sandler, and he doesn't disappoint. Many of the usual Sandler fans will cry that Sandler has gone soft, but he essentially plays the same character he normally does; a quasi-normal guy who is prone to fits of rage every now and then. For example, in one scene, he beats up a public restroom. The only difference between Punch-Drunk Love compared to his regular fare is that Sandler uses this performance to expose the twisted psychology (like the artwork used as transitions in the film) of his usual schtick. This results in a very effective performance, easily the best of his career. Another gamble has paid off for PT Anderson, Punch-Drunk Love is a visually beautiful, complex film with a simple result. The best film of 2002 thus far.Grade: A+",Punch-Drunk Love
465,bdlambert,I love this movie to pieces!,10,21 July 2003,"I connect with this movie like few other movies.  The story of Barry Egan and his painful attempts to connect with the rest of the world really moved me.  This is the first role where I liked Adam Sandler (besides ""Happy Gilmore"").The score by Jon Brion definitely adds a great deal to this movie.  So many scenes are amazing and gets my spine tingling.  One of the most striking scenes is where Barry asks his sister's dentist friend about seeing a psychologist and then he all of a sudden has a compulsion to cry is beautifully done.  And the scene where Barry repeats the last thing he said to Lena quietly to himself (""'Bye bye', 'bye bye'... you stupid mother****er"") in disgust is something that's probably in everybodies life. How many times have you thought about the time you said something you feel came out wrong and hating yourself for doing that?This was easily one of the best films of 2002 and could very well end up being one of my favourite films ever.When this movie premiered, the one thing that disturbed me was the audiences reaction to seeing the film.  I was working at a movie theatre at this time and quite commonly you'd encounter people walking out of the movie in disgust.  Or if they sat through the whole movie, they'd commonly not know what to make of it (they'd find it ""too weird"").  I don't whether these people thought they were going to see another ""Billy Madison"" cuz Sandler stars in it or if they were that thick-headed to not appreciate the merits of the movie.  And this was around the same time Jackass was coming out and these same sorts of people were eating that movie up.  I must say I wasn't feeling too highly of the human race when this happened.To those people who walked out on the movie... try and watch it again with a different mindset.  Don't expect Sandler to be doing his ""Waterboy"" shtick, watch it as a P.T. Anderson movie and allow the many intracacies of the movie come through.",Punch-Drunk Love
466,acharra27,PT Anderson is a GOD.,10,30 June 2003,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  Adam Sandler is amazing and Adam is not always amazing. The story is classic PTA.  Family.  Dysfunction.  Acceptance.  And the route one takes to achieve it.  This is not the average romance. In fact, it there is nothing average about it, but there is a romance - and hope - hidden under the layers of anger, frustration and loneliness.  Emily Watson is excellent, as usual and her chemistry with Adam WORKS.  They make it believable.  PT Anderson is amazing.  Magnolia is exceptional and so is Boogie Nights, but all have that theme of family, dysfunction and ultimately, acceptance. Wonderful.And I've got to say that the best character in the movie is portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman.  His character is rarely on the screen but when he is, you won't believe your eyes (or your ears).",Punch-Drunk Love

Shot in a pretty sureal way that compliments the amusingly original storyline. Adam Sandler is perfectly cast and shows his expertise in executing all of Barry's little oddities, as well as his hidden talent for showing Barry's loneliness and his need for love. Barry Egan is definitely the most likeable character in any of Paul Thomas Anderson's films so far. The supporting players did a really great job as well. Some really great cinematography as well, especially during the scene where Barry meets up with Lena in Hawaii and they embrace each other. The music is lovely and quirky, too.",Punch-Drunk Love
468,ANNIESCLAN-1,The Greatest Film Ever Made,10,28 June 2006,"Only after exhaustive reflection can one understand how the humility of this film allows it to glide by unrecognized. But, even then, I doubt the logic - I'm incapable of empathizing with anyone who dislikes or is indifferent concerning Punch-Drunk Love, just as Jane Austen could not feel any affinity with those disinterested by Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice. To me it's as incomprehensible as death, someone who denies the unmistakable honesty of this film's situations, its awkwardnesses, its infallible and seemingly involuntary choreography, the resonant drums and clicks which amplify and empower a character who would otherwise go unnoticed amidst the more accomplished subjects of other directors. Punch-Drunk Love retains the contained greatness of any reputable picture that elbows its way onto top ten lists, but has a modesty and profound self-sufficiency which condemns it to enjoyment only by very few. And yet it is able to subtly rise above the hypocritical competition which dominates the void of one-upping stunts found amongst heralded movies, since it has the purity of a great film which will not permit itself the ostentation and grandiosity which often make the pretentiously heroic ambitions of what we call the ""Greatest Films Ever Made"" (Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, the Apartment) so embarrassingly clear to the viewer.",Punch-Drunk Love
469,captainbacon,A bold step in the careers of both Paul Thomas Anderson and Adam Sandler,9,21 December 2015,"I like to think of this as a completely unexpected film. Everything about it was unexpected. Adam Sandler starring in a dramatic film? Paul Thomas Anderson making a somewhat charming movie that's less than two hours long? I don't think anybody could have seen this coming. Although many fans of Adam Sandler were disappointed by the tone and direction this film takes, I absolutely fell in love with it. I'm going to try and keep this spoiler free.The ActingI was blown away by Adam Sandler's performance, as it's completely different from anything else he's been in. There's something unbelievably honest about his acting. It makes me think that maybe he doesn't like constantly starring in movies like Pixels and Jack & Jill. I'd personally love to see him in another serious or dramatic film like this. The pain and loneliness of the main character is so believable. I was extremely impressed, as you can probably tell.The Writing and DirectingI applaud Paul Thomas Anderson for writing dialogue that feels so unbelievably natural. I found it very easy to lose myself in this film due to the fact that everything sounded like something I would hear in real life. Also, all of the scenarios, though occasionally weird, seemed like the type of things that could happen to anybody. I had no issue believing that what I saw was actually happening. I immediately fell in love with the characters. Sure, that's partially due to the actors, but it's very much due to the writer for giving them such charming and compelling dialogue. The writing is so good, in fact, that he was able to develop the characters by simply showing you their lives. It's quite brilliant if you ask me.The CinematographyThis is what pulls the whole thing together in my opinion. If it weren't for how graceful and perfect the cinematography was, this would be a lot less pleasant to look at. How long some shots end up being, and how much fun it is to look at this shots is brilliant. It's difficult to explain, you really must see it to believe it. I know it seems weird to praise a film's writing and acting, and then go and say that the cinematography is one of the main elements in making it good, but just remember that film is a visual medium. If it isn't interesting to look at, it might as well just be a book.Overall, I found Punch-Drunk Love to be an absolutely amazing film. It falls right between dark and light, making for an occasionally heavy, yet occasionally easy to take ride that most people should be able to enjoy. Give it a watch, you shouldn't be disappointed.",Punch-Drunk Love

Even if you escape to get bored, the connection with the characters, with the movie itself, wouldn't be so strong you could expected.

I'll recommend this movie to everybody who appreciate «breaking bad» for Whalter's transformation from teacher to criminal influenced by money and the power. Or if you appreciate «American beauty» for main character's transformation as well.
I think it's about it. About transformation from weak whiner to strong self-confident personality under the influence of love.
Paul Thomas Anderson used to make a movie about one bright especial people who put in some situation. And final of the movie generally is the resolve this problem in terms of his nature.
But eventhough director's style of this movie isn't typicall for Andersson. Post-modern humor and nonsenses stereotypical characters and situations remind the Coen's brothers style.
All that parts makes a pretty good mix that called «Punch-Drunk Love».

Anderson directed itThe first group watched the commercials and the preview, and either skipped it or dragged their girlfriends to it.  I'm guessing it didn't go over well.The second group was duped by the incredibly misleading marketing where Sandler dances in the supermarket and says ""Oh, that's niiice"" while smooching Emily Watson.  My guess here is most of the Oprah crowd either left early or turned to violence against the defenseless screen and ushers.The third group knew what they were going to see, and are grinning from ear to ear that their hero did not sell out even the slightest bit.  In fact, this movie, arguably, is the LEAST commercial film Anderson has made.Hooray for this gem!

475,bam9,Biggest surprise of the year - an Adam Sandler art film,10,6 October 2002,"I caught this at the New York film festival and my expectations were about as low as they could be. I was never a huge Adam Sandler fan, and I hadn't ever taken a liking to PT Anderson's other films. I thought that Magnolia was pretty flimsy writing-wise, and I also thought that it got way too much undue attention when it came out.
I couldn't believe how great Punch Drunk Love was. It seems to be the polar opposite of Magnolia. Where Magnolia was sprawling, messy and often generic, Punch Drunk Love is short, tight and completely fresh. It reminded me of Fargo, in a way. It centers on a very small cadre of characters, it's incredibly focused, and it creates its own world for those characters to live and move around in.
It's been mentioned here before, but the art direction is stunning. I haven't seen such memorable visuals since The Royal Tenenbaums. In a grocery store scene, the items are stacked vertically by color (echoing the color bars that appear periodically between scenes), making the scene appear otherworldly. Other sets are bare of color or distinction. Sandler's love interest in the film (played by Emily Watson) lives in a maze of white corridors. Somehow, every ""place"" in the film has its own character and association. Even the characters become associated with particular colors.
The movie ends up being genuinely romantic while deviating completely from the very stale paradigm for romantic comedies of the last decade: Watson's character pursues Barry Egan; their inability to hit it off from the start is more character-driven and psychological than situational. Through the use of bizarre props and surreal scenes, the anxiety and frustration of Barry Egan becomes totally absorbing and affecting.
This is a wonderfully directed film. There isn't an extraneous moment. The visual style and pacing are particularly great. There's an interesting subtext in the film about communication - enormous background noise while characters are on the phone, Barry Egan's sisters' voices create this wall of noise (all voices making fun of him), telephones figure predominantly, the opening scene is completely bereft of background noise or music. There are a lot of interesting things to consider when it comes to the theme of communication and how sound is handled in the film.That said, I'm already cringing at how most people are going to react to this. The Adam Sandler fans might find it too weird. People who liked PT Anderson's other movies might find it too pretensious. I was thrilled to have my low expectations completely overturned. This movie is great.",Punch-Drunk Love
476,thedarkocean@netzero.net,Like a Radiohead album-insults my intelligence,4,28 October 2002,"Just because something is weird and obscure doesn't necessarily mean it's good. Anderson takes the wacky person formula and tries to make a successful love story, but I felt it was really lacking. His use of the color breaks to possibly show Sandler's emotional state is interesting and experimental (calm and weak in the beginning, sporadic and strong towards the end). Magnolia succeeded because the film didn't delve too deeply into the convoluted relationships he featured. It was cut and dry obstacle and resolution, pretty much. Anderson tries to build the characters to some kind of emotional climax, but it never really gets there. Watson sleepwalks through the film. People in the audience weren't laughing at the funny parts that much. Using loud noises and explosive movements won't work, either. The thin, in your face exposition doesn't work in this movie because you can't go any further into the character's lives, especially Watson's. Why is she this seemingly perfect, loving character, just what Sandler needs? What's her background like? Sandler just acts weird in this movie-smashing windows, destroying bathrooms. He's just too familiar as Billy Madison, and he doesn't quite make the dramatic stretch. Does anyone know anyone like this? He pretty much spells out his motivation while facing Seymour-Hoffman with the love makes me strong routine. I guess I want this to be as realistic as possible, so I can feel that it's true to life. It wasn't a satisfying journey-although it may be a semi-accurate portrayal of women in regards to Sandler's sisters :) j/k. And the inclusion of the Utah brothers doesn't really work as a Coen Brothers-esque turn into further weirdness. But I was proud to see Canoga Ave in Chatsworth featured so prominently. I left the theater out of boredom but came back because Tower Records was closed. If you think this is a brilliant film just because it's weird, quirky or different, you must be a conceptualist. I still think you need to have some sort of continuity and resolution, a good aspect of change or arc, for it to work. This just didn't come together. 3 out of 10.",Punch-Drunk Love

Anybody with even the slightest hearing problem (and mine is very, very mild) may well find it difficult to follow some of the dialogue, due to an incessant jangling and thumping precussion on the soundtrack. Obviously meant to denote the character's confusion and jangled nerves, it instead only jangled mine, as I couldn't really hear any of the 'telephone conversations in the film' -and the plot hinges on many of them. Fortunately I had rented the DVD, and in the end had to put on the subtitles. The other option was just to give up on the film.

His ability to get you engaged in a film within the first 10 mins and keep you there is masterful. The surreal aspects of the film could lose some people as it isn't completely explained, but I think it gets us further into this disorientation Sandler's character is going through.

He stares at his phone with a combination of hope, despair, and confusion that makes him totally pathetic.  Fortunately, you can't help but like him.  Sandler has always had the promise of a certain degree of depth in his comedies, and it comes to the forefront in this film, which manages to be about alienation, love, power, and independence without actually addressing any of those issues directly. I think it's impossible not to like the films of Paul Thomas Anderson, or at the very least to respect his ambition.

As in the summary, unlike Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler can read and follow a script. I was pleasantly surprised.Maybe it's me, but I just don't get it. Unlike others, I found minimal continuity. I don't always treat movies as simple entertainment (among my favourites are Being There and Blade Runner), but I couldn't quite figure out if this was a message movie or what. I've taken film studies in college, and I think this is one of the few movies that really was made with interpretation in mind.I want to watch it again. Although I didn't enjoy it, I suspect it gets better with time, one of those flicks where the more you watch, the more you get.

PT Anderson is trying to be more and more avant-garde with every breath he takes, and the painfully pretentious results are right on the screen to behold.  Scene after pointless scene drifts by, none of it indicating anything resembling a storyline with characters we could give a you-know-what about; and all of it punctuated with self-indulgent camera movements, over-the-top background music, and pompous scene transitions involving soft-focused abstract art that has no connection whatsoever with anything in this or any other film.

Yes, I'd say no role matches his peculiar personality better as he unveils an inner rage and vulnerability, the panicky sadness that we suspected lurked behind all of his other brash, prank-pulling characters. It seemed as if Paul Thomas Anderson tried to force a tour de force out of his previous work, ""Magnolia,"" but here he keeps the story simple and (can I say it without gagging?) sweet.

485,mjrain,Anderson as Kubrick,9,19 October 2002,"Barry Eagon grew up smothered and emotionally pecked at by seven loving but annoying sisters. No parents, and especially no father, seem to be around. He is a basically good and decent man who does not seem able to bear the weight of his isolation, insecurities and anger.  He sometimes cries for no reason, and often goes into fits of violent rage hammering out plate glass doors and punching his fist though walls. When we first meet him (Adam Sandler in a fine, tightly coiled performance) he is so full of loneliness and despair he calls a sex chat line in a misguided attempt to talk to a human being who will actually listen to him.  That doesn't work out too well, but luckily for Barry, Lena walks into his life (from the alley, surrounded by light), looks and sees him clearly and loves him anyway. Through no particular effort on his part this love gives him strength and grounding.  In the early films of Federico Fellini there was often a character who fulfilled the role of angel.  Usually a child or a woman, this character saved the hero (morally or emotionally) or set him on the right path (for a good example, see La Strada).  Emily Watson's Lena is Barry's angel. In this film P.T.Anderson is continuing to explore the themes of his earlier work (questions of male gender roles and families).  I can't help but think he is assuming the role left empty with the death of Stanley Kubrick.  They both are responsible for making emotionally complex films, not universally admired, that help to illuminate the psychic strains of our modern life.

487,CelticSam,Go in with an open mind.,10,27 October 2002,"I'm a fan of Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA).  Reading the reviews here is a very similar experience to reading the reviews of Magnolia.  I actually know a guy who works in a video store who refuses to rent out Magnolia to anybody he hates it so much.  What I like about PTA, is that all reactions to his films are to the extreme.  Isn't that what good art is all about?  There are very few ho-hum opinions about his films and Punch Drunk Love is no exeption.I tend to see films with a group of friends with very similar tastes to my own, and we all loved the film.  But the only other film I have seen with as negative a crowd reaction as this one received was The Royal Tennenbaums (which I also adored).  And the movie audience was not shy about expressing their opinion during the ending credits, to which my brother replied in his best Samuel L. Jackson impersonation, ""I don't remember asking you a @#$#! thing""  silently of course.Anyways, I think too many moviegoers enter the theater with preconceived notions about what the film should be like.  They expect Adam Sandler to be Adam Sandler.  They expect a story that makes sense.  They expect it to be believable unless it is expressly fantasy.  They expect it to be nice, neat, giftwrapped, and tied together with a nice red bowtie.  If it doesn't fit in their narrowly defined box, it must be rubbish.  But just like the art of Salvador Dali or Jackson Pollack, it doesn't have to make sense in order for it to be beautiful.To be honest, I would have been disappointed if everybody loved this film. I would even be more disappointed if this film evoked an apathetic response. I'm more comfortable with a the passionate response this film seems to generate, positive or negative.For me personally, sometimes its nice to see something that seemed to be meant for a unique minority, and not the masses.  I like the challenge of integrating something that creates cognitive dissonance.  And it's filmmakers like PTA that keep me interested in film.",Punch-Drunk Love

And to top it off, some of the action is less than credible and hard to digest.My advice...WAIT FOR VIDEO!!!The only place this film succeeds is that, at times, it is brutally honest and bold.

489,Bubblegum_Boo,More Art Than Entertainment.,7,11 September 2008,"A film that passed me by at the time of it's theater release Punch Drunk Love must surely have baffled and irritated a great many people who would have likely associate Sandler with comedy. This is no comedy, it isn't even a conventional film of any genre. ""Experimental"" is the word that comes to mind!For me PDL was like a lonely cinematic migraine with painful thuds and streaks slowly melting away to reveal the soft glow of companionship. The unusual visual style & score are not separate from the performances but rather manifestations of Barry's state of mind & make this film an interesting experience but not one which I would choose to repeat anytime soon.",Punch-Drunk Love
490,iamjacksemail,Anderson's Palate Applied to Love,9,8 November 2002,"Punch-Drunk Love is at once a great departure from P.T. Anderson's previous effort, Magnolia, and a film that bears striking similarities. It is a film the makes beautiful use of a striking palate and impressive visual sense to tell a story of archetypal, half-formed characters that is engaging both emotionally and intellectually. The film is absorbing and loose, feeling at once like it could happen to anyone (and Sandler does a solid job of playing an anyman whose problems outweigh his abilities) and it could not possibly happen to anyone. As did Magnolia, it picks up fragments of lives and places them in an almost magic realist realm where they seem to exist free of the events that led up to them or will inevitably follow. Punch-Drunk Love is perhaps most engaging for this quality of being ever in the present. Anderson refreshingly ignores the past and the future of his characters, building them out of the events that play before us. He assembles loose strands into an almost abstract collection of beautiful vignettes that build on each other to a climax that resolves the action but leaves the end as open as the beginning. What is most striking about the film is this unique sense of time that absorbs you and leaves you with a sense that while you have witnessed events, time has not really moved. This movement makes the film enchanting and absorbing.",Punch-Drunk Love

Art house film that should come with a warning lable. Bad score, simple story, and bad camera work that only art house people can grab onto as ""original"".

494,AdamMitchyCat,Adam Sandler Actually Blew Me Away,7,1 April 2015,"I'm stating this now: I've only seen one other Paul Thomas Anderson movie as of now, and that film was ""Magnolia,"" which I loved for all of its characters, its story, and the filmmaking process itself. It's just difficult to sit and watch a film for over three hours.One benefit ""Punch-Drunk Love"" has right away over its former is that it is only half of the running time. Does that make for a stronger picture? Honestly, I like them both about the same.One big surprise to me was Adam Sandler. Before this, I knew him as the man Chris Farley made break character on SNL and the guy who makes all these awful Happy Madison movies that are being released today. But ""Punch-Drunk Love"" showed me how much potential he has as an actor. One scene really sticks out to me: There is a part where Sandler's character calls a sex hot line, and the shot just keeps going and going and going for I swear feels like an hour. It was incredible, and I know Paul Thomas Anderson is known for his long shots, but for a newcomer to his filmography, I thought that was incredible. All the characters feel real and interesting, even in this unrealistic scenario. One thing I felt was a little too unclimatic was when Sandler confronts the Philip Seymour Hoffman character for the first time, the man who screwed him over this entire movie. But all Sandler does is threaten, and then leave. I would've liked something a little stronger, even if I can see what they were going for, and it probably worked out better in the long run.Overall, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a great movie with a surprising Adam Sandler performance and beautiful, impressive cinematography. It isn't for everyone, but the people who will get into it will REALLY get into it. Highly recommended.",Punch-Drunk Love
495,rick-udell,Not Predictable,9,18 May 2003,"Punch Drunk Love is a brilliant film, It is not predictable like most movies of late, Adam Sandler really shined, all the acting was good in this movie, the only thing what I didn't like which doesn't matter, was for about 10 Minutes in the middle of the film the music in the background is to loud and it distracts you and the voices are hard to hear.

So how surprised was I to see how excellent he can be and simultaneously disappointed he isn't always always this good. The film is dark and hilarious, there are plenty of giggles, bellows and smirks throughout this movie and not one fart gag. This film certainly has more of a heart than all of his other movies put together. It is directed superbly. The emotion and comedy is very subtle and understated by Paul Thomas Anderson, who's only other work I have seen is the excellent There Will Be Blood. It's a very intelligent, subtle and multi-dimensional movie which made me laugh and cry.",Punch-Drunk Love
497,MistressKela,Waste of talent and time.,1,28 October 2003,First off...this is not a good role for Adam Sandler.  The ONLY kind of acting he can do is comedy...which this was not.  There is no plot.  When the entire movie can be summed up in about 3 sentences...theres a problem. What was the point of the piano?  The yogurt?  How did he get to Utah and back in like....5 minutes?  Why didnt he get his ass kicked?  Why didnt he kill the phone sex op?  This movie was a huge waste of time.,Punch-Drunk Love

I really wanted to kick the walls, break the windows and smash my neighbour's face when the tension was raising, and raising, and raising... Anger at its best.It has a couple of humorous moments, but that's not the main strength of the movie. The camera work, the music, the acting. And Adam Sandler exploding at the peak moments is just amazing. He reminds me of the acting skills of Jim Carrey. He may be a joker, a clown, but when he puts his intent on developing a character or showing off strong emotions (think The Truman Show), he really shines. The same thing happens here with Sandler. From a comic guy who makes funny voices and impersonations, to the terrible Barry Egan, there's a whole leap, and he goes all the way easily.",Punch-Drunk Love
499,BEnDR1985,Beautiful Artistic Film & A New Direction for Adam Sandler,7,9 April 2006,"While I'm not a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson I do enjoy this film very much for more cinematic purposes and from the perspective of a director. If you're looking at this film because you love the goofy, lovable, jackass; Adam Sandler then you will be thoroughly disappointed. Adam Sandler becomes a completely different actor completely and surprises and shocks the audience by his acting capabilities. His performance will leave you uncomfortable, touched and enlightened. Emily Watson (as always) plays a lovable British sweetheart that is very interested in Adam Sandler's character. The two of them create a heart melting romance that changes and helps Adam Sandler's character through his struggles with life and being able to break barriers as a person.The film starts out showing us the awkward and unorthodox life of Barry Egan (Sandler) and relationship with his: seven sisters, his business partner (played by Luis Guzman), and a conflict that he encounters with a phone sex-line company that threatens to send their gang of ""brothers"" to help him over money to them during a hard time in their business. Barry is a quiet person that is rather anti-social and is embarrassed easily, he hides behind his lies and denial so that his girlfriend Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) doesn't think that he's a loser. But when the 'brothers' begins to ask to hard and begins to cause Barry and Lena's relationship harm, Barry stands up for the woman he loves.While many argue to say that this film has no plot, I ask ""Are you completely out of your mind?"" The film is a beautiful portrait of a relationship and how love changes people and makes them step outside of their comfort zones. I truly recommend for the open-minded and insightful.",Punch-Drunk Love
500,michaelavonnypalin,I regret that I paid $7.95 for the DVD,2,25 April 2020,"What a great pity that this movie wasn't made properly. It was as though it was the camera man's first day on the job. No one wants to watch a movie and have the sense of the camera-man awkwardly lumbering about in it.Worst music I have ever heard in a movie. Dreadful. As though a toddler got hold of a cheap keyboard and was pressing all the different sound options to try them out. To make it worse, the music was too loud in reference to the dialogue. Irritating as hell. I came close to turning the movie off, but stuck with it because I'd paid for it. Realistically, though, life is too short to waste it on a movie such as this. Do yourself a favour and give Punch-Drunk Love a wide berth.I'm giving this movie two out of 10. The points are for the actors. Everything else was fairly crapful. The beginning of the movie was dreadfully slow and tedious. Could have been a decent movie if it had been made properly. That dreadful music.

501,ineedaneasyfriend,An astonishing performance by Adam Sandler...with a brain.,7,1 March 2006,"OPENING COMMENT: Since being registered with IMDb over the summer, I have done nothing but post comments on threads. Please bear with me when I tell my opinion about this.2002 was a bad year for Adam Sandler. Besides starring in the worst comedies of 2002 (""Mr. Deeds,"" ""Eight Crazy Nights""), he also produced two box-office failures (""Master of Disguise, ""The Hot Chick""). Maybe that's why him and his friends took a break from writing and trusted other people's screenplays (""Anger Management,"" ""50 First Dates,"" ""Spanglish""). I guess Sandler knew he was going to have a tumultuous year...which is why he took a chance with P.T. Anderson to star in ""Punch Drunk Love"" (who wrote the inside-look of the porn industry in ""Boogie Nights""). I don't watch much of Anderson's movies, but as a Sandler fan, this is one of my favorites.Sandler (who has nothing to do with producing or writing the film) plays emotional, anxiety, and angst-ridden salesman Barry Egan, whose sisters keep hassling him and telling everybody embarrassing stories about him. When he gets under a lot of stress, occasional raged outbursts leash out of him. I guess having no one to talk to, or trying to cope with problems fuel his anger. Other than that, Barry buys Healthy Choice pudding for their frequent-flier miles promotion and makes that habit-forming. Unfortunately, Barry, unable to deal with life, calls a phone sex line, hoping it would remedy his gloominess. It doesn't, however. A sleazy owner of a mattress store in Utah (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) tries to blackmail Sandler's weepy character and extort $750 from him. He succumbs, however, when giving money to four brothers who knows his personal information. But, after, falling in love with a woman who doesn't hate him (played by Emily Watson) -although everyone surrounding him does-he feels relieved. After spending a romantic getaway with her in Hawaii, he seems to figure out his life has a purpose and he doesn't have to pessimistic about any event in his life anymore. Alas, a fragment of his past returns when the four brothers look to extort him again. Sandler teaches the brothers a lesson in this climax of the movie. Sandler gives an unexpected and surprising performance as the antagonist, and so does Phillip Hoffman as the protagonist. The script is simple, but right on point. The color patterns occasionally turning up on the screen when something happens, the camera movements, and the fact that Barry doesn't change his suit are my favorite little aspects of the film. I felt that Sandler was dead-on, giving his first mature role here and the chemistry between Lena and Barry was simply magic. This is a great film and I'm glad that Adam Sandler keeps doing roles like these.",Punch-Drunk Love
502,Josfaber,Great,9,9 January 2007,"Awesome film. Oh, i liked this. I've seen this movie a long time ago, and yesterday i thought ""what the hell"" and watched it again. The concept of this film is great, it is simply a movie you can watch any time of any day, just to feel good. I liked Adam for several years now, but after Happy Gilmore, this is one of my favorites. His acting is amazing, in his blue suite, he does incredible dumb things and runs a even dumber business. And I didn't mention the music yet, it should make you feel happy and will certainly make you laugh. That goes for the complete movie: Garanteed Laugh!",Punch-Drunk Love

505,adhoc,Is this it?,2,3 November 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson - is he any good?I liked Boogie Nights very much, and didn't actualy see Magnolia (people I know either loved it or hated it), but I know there's a lot of hype behind the man. He's the next big thing of American cinema. A 21st Century Scorcese.Frankly, though, this film was rubbish. An Adam Sandler comedy* is not something I'd usually go out and watch, but given the director and the amount of positive critiques the film had attracted I thought it would be worth seeing. Honestly I'd rather have watched Happy Gilmore.
To be honest Sandler turns in a great performance, and maybe this is what the hype around Anderson is all about - if he can pull a great acting performance out of Adam Sandler, then that's obviously where his strengths lie. But the rest of the film is just overdirected. I found myself unable to enjoy the (flimsy and quirky to no particular effect) plot and the performances because I was being constantly bombarded with ""meaningful"" long holds on odd things, or elaborate tracking shots, or odd camera angles. I haven't yet been convinced of the hype around Anderson, but it seems that he has.There are redeeming qualities - the way he invokes the dischord in Sandler's head and the acting, but overall, I was just left with a profound sense of ""is this it?""(*The word ""comedy"" here is used in its loosest form. You know, it's not actually funny, it's just a bit surreal. I suspect they were contractually bound to put the word ""comedy"" in the promotional literature to sell the film. ""Oh Myrtle, it's that funny Sandler guy, you remember from Big Daddy, and it's a comedy. Let's go and see it. He cracks me up.""

506,Laszlo_deAlmasy,Intoxicate yourself with this beautiful picture,10,3 November 2002,"I'm not much of a film critic. The only other time I've commented on a movie was to bash it because it was horrible. This movie, however, was too good not to say something about.First of all, I'm a HUGE fan of PT Anderson. Boogie Nights was great, Magnolia was a masterpiece and Punch-Drunk Love was somewhere in-between. It's definitely unique from his other work. I believe it's his first romance or comedy movie. But it's not really a romantic comedy, at least not another Julia Roberts romantic/comedy. It sticks in that odd, quirky genre that fews films do.One of my friends asked me what was so good about it after we saw it and I really couldn't explain it right away. It's the same satisfaction I derived from Magnolia. There's something about the way Anderson can mix and match little things whose sum total is greater in the picture than each one by themselves. He can express a message or emotion clearer than most writers or directors out there, without spelling things out for you.Aside from the great direction, this movie, like his others, is very well-written. Anderson might receive a third nomination for original screenplay, which he deserves. Adam Sandler really can act once he is given a good character. Personally, I can connect with Barry Egan, which made me very happy to see someone who is abused by his sisters and embarrassed in his social life overcome his fear when he finds a woman he loves and stands up to defend that. Some people may think that his character behaves weird in the movie. But honestly, people really act like that in real life. People do things that don't necessarily make sense just because their judgment or thinking is messed up. Sometimes they don't always think about things before reacting on emotions in some situations.I'm not usually a sucker for romantic comedies. I tend to be skeptical of most relationships and think most of those kind of movies are too sugar-coated. This movie, however, didn't have that ""Hollywoodized"" after taste of false sentiment. Adam Sandler and Emily Watson are wonderful together.I hope this movie gets at least some credit at the end of the year awards shows. Magnolia was robbed of a screenplay and song oscar and at least a picture nomination. PT Anderson is definitely the most underrated of all the directors working today. In the end, not quite as good as Magnolia, but still a film to get very drunk on. LOVE the last shot!10/10",Punch-Drunk Love

Nothing really happens, the film bores you the way long.I had to use fast-forward after approx. 80% to finish the film and after coming to the end, i'd knew it was a good choice.Avoid it, if you want to have a good time with a film.",Punch-Drunk Love

509,mmoore18,An empty film with no pulse,5,2 June 2003,"I like Paul Thomas Anderson (PTA), I really do. But I think 'Hard Eight' and 'Boogie Nights' were his better films. 'Magnolia' just didn't do it for me. Sure, it had nice cinematography, some interesting scenes, but in the end it's a meandering, semi-pointless, over-wrought film.'Punch-Drunk Love' (PDL) is not quite as bad as 'Magnolia' in the above regards, but it does have many similar qualities. The pacing is very difficult - you keep waiting for something to happen, but nothing does - and the plot points aren't enough to drive the action. The movie is disjointed and often monotonous - almost like hearing a church bell ring and ring and ring the same note until you want to kill yourself. This is not a superb or remarkable story, and that short-coming is accentuated by the tense feel of the film. Sometimes it is just hard to watch - not because its plot is hard to follow, but because the scenes just aren't that interesting. PTA's narrative leaves a lot to be desired.The acting is okay. I've seen much praise for Adam Sandler's work in PDL, and I take exception to that. Although Sandler's acting in this film is different, it has not reached new heights. Different is not necessarily better. Sandler's acting just doesn't have the right power in certain scenes. When he gets angry in the final confrontation with Philip Seymour Hoffman's character, his lines are delivered in a thoroughly placid and unconvincing way. A man in love shouldn't seem so passionless.
Watson's acting in this film was neither good nor bad, just unremarkable. She actually looked somewhat attractive (as opposed to some of her other films), but her lines were few and her screen time with Sandler limited. A parrot might have delivered the same lines and it would have made little difference.With a title like 'punch-drunk love,' one would expect some passion from the characters. Watson and Sandler have little, if any, chemistry - certainly not enough to make one believe these two are in love. The love-story as a whole is underdeveloped, despite the titular claims.You don't really know where this movie is going to go while you're watching it; at first you might think Barry Eagon's mental problems are the main focus, then you have the phone-sex entanglement, and finally the love story. The truth is it goes to all those places but doesn't ever come full circle.
Already mentioned was the under-developed love story, and the same can be said about the phone-sex scam. Nothing ever really happens. Sandler is harrassed for a bit, has his money stolen and his car damaged with his girlfriend in it, and then he undergoes a change from meek to assertive. This transformation is underwhelming and leads nowhere.
The 'confrontation' between Sandler and Hoffman is anti-climactic and dull. There is no real tension in a scene between two guys on the verge throwing fists - and any guy who has been in a fight before knows that when you're face to face possibly about to take a swing or get hit yourself, the adrenaline is pumping. There is zero adrenaline in this scene. The end result is a flat-line.Hoffman was also praised a good bit on here, which I find strange. He was in the film only briefly, and be honest - if that was a B-list actor, or any other actor for that matter, you wouldn't have noticed.
Basically, after watching this movie, you should be thinking ""So what?"" This is a dull half-baked story that leads nowhere and is delivered poorly - all wrapped up in some decent and sometimes great camera work. But it takes more than creative sets and shots to make a movie - it takes a plot, it takes emotion, it takes a driving force, and a connection to the audience. This movie does not have any of that. While artistic and unique in many respects, 'PDL' is an empty film with no pulse.I hate Hollywood-type movies - you won't see me in line for tickets to Terminator 3 or the ridiculously-titled '2 Fast 2 Furious.' I like movies that make you think. I like movies that are different, that don't cram everything down your throat. I like subtlety and appreciation of the aesthetic. This film tries for that, it tries to win with style, but it lacks substance. You need both to make a meaningful movie.",Punch-Drunk Love

Far less involved then ""Magnolia"", and far less appalling then ""Boogie"", at worst this film can be called ""cute, at best ""great"".  I really liked the film, and I was amazed that Adam Sandler was so stellar in it.  This movie proceeds with a certain detachment, a different style for PTA.  You like and love the characters, but you know weird things are being thrown at them.  I do believe, unlike some people, that the relationship Barry Egan has with his sisters is perfectly evident in about 2 minutes.  I don't really need a background to understand how destructive family can unintentionally be.  This is not a ""film geeks"" film, it's just a ""good, quirky movie"".  It reminded me a lot of the Coen brothers actually. This is also a pretty good example of what good acting and directing can do to a plot that is basically simple.  If you looked at the story on paper, you wouldn't be impressed, but Sandler, Watson, Hoffman, and Anderson do wonders to it.  Expert use of music by Anderson again in this film.

512,bsilver12,did not like it at all,4,20 October 2002,"(slight spoilers)While I definitely did the the merit in the artistic and cinematography in the film, I thought the story line was inconsistent and unrealisitic.  To believe that this woman would love this man because of what she sees inside him was hard to grasp.  He was dangerous and scary. I see it very hard to believe that someone could just look past all that, in fact, in never bothered her in any way.  IT was almost as if she was desperate for someone to like her, which did not fit with her character at all. Besides for that, the plot of the movie was slow moving, and the antics that Adam Sandler went though were to me just plain stupid.

In fact, it is in need of the exact opposite...I think that although the story was incredibly simple, it remained unique in it's own way. The acting from Adam Sandler was absolutely amazing, and the character he portrayed was very interesting and well versed.Barry, Sandler's character, is faced with many problems, one of which is himself and his emotional problems. While trying to overcome these problems, he is also faced with many others including his family, work, women and a credit card scam after calling a sex chat line. Seeing Sandler deal with these problems is like looking into someone's life, and everything he does is very real and believable.Without spoiling this film I'd like to say that everything in it is resolved in a very pleasing way, and the climax is absolutely breathtaking! With superb acting, directing, cinematography, editing and sound I would like to recommend this film to anyone who still enjoys cinema with a beating heart and living soul.

518,SternMystic,"Too metaphorical, Pretty slow, Nice portrayal though",4,21 February 2004,"(Feel free to bash n trash this review, thats how I will improve and give better/balanced reviews)I am a fan of Adam the goofy kind. I knew this would be different, but I guess I was'nt expecting anything this slow moving. I convinced a group of ten to watch the movie and we all left after the first half, round abt when she calls him from a phone booth. There was definitely some depth in the movie and in the portrayal of characters. But they could have spiced it up a bit. And I dont mean throwing in cheap entertainment but making it more fun too. For example, if youve seen Amelie and feel PDL lies in the same league, you might also notice that Amelie was more enetertaining and there were times when you'd like popcorn in your mouth. I quite liked the character Adam portrayed and even totally understood his feelings in some of the situations like the psychologist, overbearing family etc. What Im trying to say is you can go ahead a pack a lot of metaphors, meanings of life, different takes on aspects in life but the art lies in packing it well and not letting you feel time go by. During PDL I felt every minute go by, at this point you must also knwo that I have  avg. patience with everything and so dont go blaming it on my youth/immaturity. If you reply to this against it, also add some movies that you felt were in the same league and deserved a rating of 7 on 10 and I will let you know whether I enjoyed those movies. Example of artistic or slow movies that I enjoyed include Amelie, Jonathon Livingstone Seagull, 2001:ASO.",Punch-Drunk Love
519,SprocketReviews,"Brutal, but Sweet.",9,6 October 2011,"Though not a fan of films starring Adam Sandler, a few guilty pleasures I must say, Paul Thomas Anderson takes Adam Sandler to a fresh new role with the same explosive attitude, but taken in different directions. A film where you don't point and laugh, but sit back and feel sympathy towards the man. Harassed to no end by his sisters and with a failing business for novelty plungers, Barry is portrayed as someone you want to distant yourself from, but wish him for happiness. This is Sandler's best performance. Through good writing and great acting, you get connected as you see Barry's adventure into his first love, Lena, and confront his reflection, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The cinematography stands out, excellent direction as usual from Paul Thomas Anderson; one of the best directors of the modern era in my personal opinion.",Punch-Drunk Love
520,golfpunk111,slow and painful,2,19 August 2010,"i seem to be one of the very few that hate this movie, it was slow, painful and weird. the storyline was woeful, the only thing that made it slightly bearable was adam sandler providing a solid performance in a role you wouldn't expect from him, which made it slightly interesting, but this novelty soon wears off. my opinion don't waste your money buying or renting this movie it is garbage. this is how bad the movie was, when i saw the rating it had here i felt compelled to register and sign up to IMDb to try and set the record straight and save some eyes and ears from bleeding. this has got to be the worst adam sandler movie yet. reign on me was a far superior movie to this that had sandler playing a slightly less than normal role.",Punch-Drunk Love
521,alastair-fyfe-1,An appalling film.,1,13 June 2003,"This film was appalling. Those who have seriously enjoyed it must have found something new to inhale. This would include the director, whose idea of making a film - at least in this tragic effort - is to commit the screen and the audience to total silence and to follow this by some explosive sequence to make sure we're still here! Some of the audience in my theatre weren't - (sensible folk). For those who love this director and this film, please check out the sequence with the two lovers hugging each other at the end of the corridor in the Pink Palace in Waikiki in silhouette. The background vacationers - (cue the background for those who enjoy movie-making parlance )- are all briskly walking from left to right and vice versa as in city rush mode. Vacationers? Excuse me. This guy's an amateur. Ask Spielberg, he'll tell you. Oh, and as to those credits which appeared at the end of the film - I'd say 'debits' would describe them better. Finally, a message to Philip Seymour Hoffman : What on earth possessed you to appear in this rubbish!",Punch-Drunk Love
522,PunchDrunkMatt,"Great film, unique as hell",9,27 July 2005,"Very interesting film. From the cinematography, to the the art direction to the acting, this is a top notch film. Paul Thomas Anderson is at the top of his game. His use of symmetry on the screen is fantastic, this film contains some of the most jarring and crisp camera-work I have seen in years. The film has one of the strongest atmospheres within itself, which is hard for any filmmaker to create. Not to mention Adam Sandler's best role yet. EnjoyIt is rare that a filmmaker with such a strong vision comes along. I think PTA is one of the four or five best directors of this generation(Christopher Nolan and Darren Aronofsky are up there too). See Magnolia if your looking for an interesting film as well.",Punch-Drunk Love
523,sayaman,I found this movies to be incredibly disturbing (SPOILERS),6,8 September 2006,"I think the intensity and the shift between extreme violence and romance left me feeling very disturbed. I couldn't connect with the love story in this movie as I felt the violence was just too extreme and had me constantly on an edge.I was always thinking, ""What was Barry going to do next?"" I also constantly feared for Barry and Lena's life. i thought at any moment the scummers would come out and shoot them. I mean I find it hard to believe after the violent exchange between Barry and the scammers they didn't go after to kill him or Lena.I too sometimes feel fits of rage but not to Barry's extreme. To me the movie was neither comedic nor romantic, but incredibly disturbing in portraying a person's lack of mental stability, social skills and an extreme shift in emotions between anger to happiness. At any time he could snap into a burst of violence, extreme violence.I found the scene where they are about to make love and he says he wants to smash her to be scary and disturbing. I actually thought he was going to smack her. Actually, Barry's character scared me.PS: I can't see their relationship lasting. I can see eventually Barry's social retardness will consume the relationship and it is only a matter of time before he directs his violence at her. I'm surprised he didn't kill anyone in this movie.",Punch-Drunk Love

I mean I've loved this movie for years, as a matter of fact I love it so much that I cut my viewings of it down to the most 3 times a year just so it will stay fresh and brilliant in my mind as it did when i first saw it 6 years ago.I suppose I understand where things didn't go as expected for this movie. The marketing was bad. Unfortunately Adam Sandler had been type cast up to this point. And it really should not have been marketed as a comedy from the beginning because although this movie is a wonderful piece of dark comedy it is mostly a drama, and to the untrained and inexperienced eye it will come off as one.I wish i could articulate more than I am able to at the moment, all i can really say is this movie makes me giddy and I get this warm feeling when i watch it. Not many things in this life do that for me and thats why i've taken the time to write this review.Don't pay any mind to the bad reviews of this movie. They're dead wrong!!

526,seamus-rae,Underrated masterpiece,9,2 June 2018,"While I personally cannot say in good faith that this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best film, it is the one that made me feel the most. I feel like this is a very personal film in an emotional way that PTA's other films like Boogie Nights and The Master can not compare to. It is the story of Barry Eagan, a lonely, awkward, and troubled man who meets the woman of his dreams. While nothing strictly impossible happens in the film, it does present itself as a kind of fantasy. Many unexplained (if not unexplainable) things occur in the film that may throw casual viewers off. The music is sweeping, and the dialogue feels grand. Barry is played by Adam Sandler, who gives one of the best performances of his career. He plays a sort of inverse of his usual Happy Madison charicatures. Barry is awkward, very strange, and has anger management problems. However, here I felt extreme pity for Sandler's character. I understand the feeling of being an outcast, and when Barry says sometimes he ""cries for no reason"" and begins crying right then, I found myself tearing up. I understand why someone might not react this way to this scene; they may even feel inclined to laugh. Punch-Drunk Love is the kind of movie you either get or you don't. I think I did.",Punch-Drunk Love
527,michael_asbridge,my review on punch drunk love,10,18 May 2005,"This film requires some effort so don't go to see it if you fancy something purely entertaining rather than intellectually challenging - depends on your mood!This film is funny and moving and thought provoking and puts itself out in the demillitarized zone of the creators and the viewers equally.This film is (more than many others) what you make of it. And that is credit to the script writer and director who have trodden the line well between imposing ideas on you; and letting you interpret the spaces in the film.The two central characters played by Adam Sandler and Emily Watson are dysfunctional but honourable people who are making their way in the world despite their personality flaws.Their personalities contain stalking and violent tendencies (Emily and Adam respectively) but they are not to be judged on their behaviour entirely but rather on what is motivating their behaviour and how good they are to people around them. Other characters such as the Mattress Man and the Phone Sex girl are dysfunctional too, but they lack the redeeming feature of sincerely trying to be good people. This is instructional in what makes us all tick without exception - we are all weird/individuals: but what saves us from grotesqueness is trying (and succeeding ideally!) to do the right thing.The music score, mix of reality film and fantasy colour sequences are startling, moving and hypnotic. This film, like any earnest film that is trying to say something about people's lives rather than just to entertain, can be accused of being 'worthy' and 'neurotic'; or it can be praised for being 'liberating' and 'consoling'. Ultimately this film for me was moving, pioneering and memorable and all those who made it and watch it will share an experience that is of some considerable value to them.Oh and I really fancy Emily Watson so I guess I am biased! And Adam Sandler is really showing a great range in this movie.Then again I am not entirely biased as I saw 'The Waterboy' and Adam Sandler in that (just like Jim Carrey) can be hugely irritating or hugely impressive depending on the vehicle - they should both take a look at Robin Williams (as a previous generation equivalent) and realise that when they are playing to their strengths they are great and when not they are a bit irritating ('least to this reviewer).Enjoy this film in your own way and don't let me influence you : )",Punch-Drunk Love
528,delicatebeginnings,Sandler's immature and prehistoric sense of humor,1,25 June 2006,"is what makes this another movie to file under ""make sure not to watch"".Since his first appearance on TV, Sandler forced his sick sense of humor onto the poor unsuspecting audience. Is this what you call entertainment? Do comedians not have any obligations to the public? How are Sandler's so called entertainment pieces helping any of us be a better person?I find it hard to answer these questions. On a related note, I find Sandler incredibly ugly and can hardly bear to watch him on screen let alone enjoy his ""work"". Besides, as he plays the same role in every movie with the same old ""jokes"" rewinding over and over again, watching one of his movies is just enough to guess the others.Before I wrote this comment, I watched additional Sandler movies, might I add, with disgust.

Starting out with the discord and harmony theme, Anderson begins a journey of love and the overwhelming effects that love has on our lives.

It caused me to squirm in my seat in anguish. That music should be used during interrogation of suspected terrorists.

Punch Drunk Love is not a sprawling multi-character epic like Magnolia or Boogie Nights, but that doesn't mean that Anderson has sold out or whatever people are trying to imply.

I hear that the movie comes together in the last 5 minutes, but the first 45 were so unpleasant, I didn't want to wait it out.  If you're looking for an art film with bizarrely creative cinematography, this is your film.  If you want remotely likeable characters or a plot that makes at least a little sense, stay away from this movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
542,themarsdecoy,True Cinema,10,12 October 2002,"P.T. Anderson knows how to write screenplays. His dialogue works like a symphony of words for actors acting more real than real. Symbolizing his themes and telling a visual story as well (be it frogs falling from the sky or an unexplained exploding car), he spins not a web of danger for his characters, but open doors that lead to hope. Such true hope is rarely seen in movies.To direct said symbolism onto film is an artistic feat that Anderson excels in. With Punch-Drunk Love he proves once again he knows more directing tricks than anyone else in Hollywood; creating frames worthy of watching with the sound down.What makes this movie even more amazing is the acting Anderson draws from Adam Sandler.  The way Sandler carries his character makes one wonder if the part weren't written with him in mind. Sandler finds a way to give grace to a character with more mental problems than Healthy Choice pudding.
For those of you that get P.T. Anderson you'll find Punch-Drunk Love to be lighter and shorter than his previous offerings. You might as well add more tolerable to that list as well. Anyone unfamiliar with Anderson's films will enjoy an unusual story and can witness cinema being utilized at its finest.",Punch-Drunk Love
543,elby914,Great Movie - I don't know why i bother!,10,18 January 2003,"The Movie is incredibly charming and well made (not to mention brave). My only worry is that those who give such scathing reviews, who seem to dismiss the movie completely, calling it boring, unrealistic, etc... seem to be missing the point completely and don't seem to have asked a very important question - What is the director attempting to do by making a movie like this? I think once a viewer bothers to ask this question (and GASP - possibly think for a second) the movie becomes incredibly entertaining and enjoyable. The point, for those of you who missed it was to create a movie that was as close to being a musical as possible without actually being a musical. Notice that a number of the filmic elements conform to that of a typical movie-musical. The characters wear outlandish outfits (namely the blue suit and other monochromatic outfits), the acting is over the top, the characters seem to dance all of a sudden for no reason, a number of seemingly impossibly lucky things happen, and the camera sweeps through the diagetic space. Moreover, the plot is very similar to any movie musical. The characters serve only one direct purpose. There is the hero, the villain, the henchman, and the damsel in distress. The movie takes these aspects of the musical and creates a film that has a sweepingly musical feel without actually having the characters sing and dance (more than once). Anyway, i'm pretty sure that none of this will help - people have been conditioned to go see the same boring formulaic movies that overshadow anything of value like this.",Punch-Drunk Love
544,SayaB,one word to describe this film: amazing,10,2 November 2002,"I can honestly say that Punch-Drunk Love is one of the best films that I have seen this year. It has a wealth of beautiful, artistic shots, which is a rarity in today's movies. So many of the scenes in this film are incredible to watch, not only for the wonderful writing as well as the great acting from Sandler and Watson, but also for the way they are so unique and interesting to the viewer's eye. With this film, Paul Thomas Anderson has created some wonderful visuals for his sincere, yet often surreal romantic comedy. While watching Punch-Drunk Love, I was astounded by Adam Sandler's acting. To some, it may seem like a slightly more serious version of any one of his previous characters, but I felt that he was tender, heart-warming, and  yet heart-wrenching at the same time. I felt that as Barry Egan, Adam Sandler really connected with the audience. When watching his performance, you can't help but feel pity for him. When so many things go poorly for him, you feel bad for him, but when things are looking up, you feel happy for him. I believe that this is the first time that Sandler has been able to really bring a character to life. I mean, I won't deny that I have enjoyed his past movies, but this is by far his best work. I recommend that everyone see this film. Though it may not be loved by everyone, it definitely has a lot to offer any movie lover.",Punch-Drunk Love

The whole movie is surreal to the umpteenth degree with its amazing camera work, the music, the dreamlike color effects, and just the general mood/tone of the movie.I left the theaters dazzled, and amazed at what I had just saw.

Given that, I spent alot of the movie trying to discover a point of view in which the movie would make sense. Finally, I gave up the idea of making sense and went for the experience. But the experience I got was a quirky, misguided look at a dysfunctional family who drove their only brother to dyslexic, comatose, bi-polar half-life magnified, as if it needed to be magnified, by weird camera and sound track treatments. One couple we went with left. The audience was complaining so loudly that we could hardly hear the dialogue. Still I know that to those who can't hear the music, the dancers seem insane (George Carlin) so I continued to look for the redeeming value in this movie. Unfortunately I ended feeling like the brunt of a social experiment gone bad. If the writer would take this boundless energy he obviously has and rather than trying to express and have people get his own mental state, he creates the same simple story told powerfully, the customer (us humble movie-goers) would have heard the story in our language... if I had wanted to see a foreign movie, I would have picked one that didn't have an English title.

550,psyberdyne,worst movie ever,1,21 August 2006,"Boring, pointless, awful, disturbingly annoying, and painful to watch. To paraphrase the comic book guy from The Simpsons ""Worst movie ever!"", I kid you not! Long sequences with nothing (not even light music). Even what little random violence there is in it is so pointless and over so quickly it only accentuates the painfully boring blankness. This movie is the result of the nothing and the emptiness ripping the soul out of creativity as described by the never ending story, but somehow the movie was passed over when the imagination was restored. Even the ""love"" story part of the movie is unmoving and very un-chick flickish. It is very hard to come up with 10 lines to describe how awful it is because it is an empty sucking hole of a waste of time. While watching it I had some hope the organ would turn into some interesting story line, but it did not, it was just a pointless piece of background brought to the front for what must have been an attempt at artistic expression. The entire story comes off as a blank piece of paper someone could better use as a paper airplane. This movie is easily worse than ""mulan rouge"", ""plan 9 from outer space"", or ""Frogs"", it is truly the most heinous piece of you know what that I have ever seen. If the scale went to zero the score would still be too high, this movie drags the entire art of movie making down a couple of notches with it.",Punch-Drunk Love

Was he just a little messed up, a sociopath, suffering from an obsessive disorder, or mentally impaired. The writing and directing was the worst. There were no opening credits, but there was lines of bright colored blurry lights, which reappeared periodically throughout the movie. Much of the film was intentionally blurry, which some people may find arty.

Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always a pleasure to watch playing his character with unpredictable menace and irony. This film is beautifully crafted with amazing cinematography by DP Robert Elswit. PT Anderson deservedly won for Best Director at Cannes and in my opinion should have won at Sundance too. There is nothing about this movie I can fault.

Anderson, as with the progression from Boogie Nights to Magnolia you can see his growth as a director with this film. For anyone who is expecting a standard Adam Sandler comedy or the hardcore drama of his previous films, do not watch this movie, it is truly a dark comedy and should be treated as such.The film follows shy, but lovable, Barry Egan (Sandler) through a week of his life.  Barry meets a beautiful woman, Lena (Watson), who despite all of the embarrassingly personal stories Barry's 7 sisters have told her about him, she still wants to meet and go out with him.Barry's loneliness gets him in trouble as he decides to call a 900 sex line just to have someone to talk to.  Barry soon finds out that the 900 line he has called is a crooked one, out to make his life miserable and steal all of his money.The great thing about this film is that it will make you laugh out loud through the entire film, till the last 15 minutes of the film and you will see Barry's final realization, that is well worth watching the entire film for.If you liked PT Anderson's other films, then you will absolutely love this one.",Punch-Drunk Love

Despite the yammering of the other ""reviewers"", who are obviously canadian, this film is a true gem in the rough when everything else is pure crap. I gave this film a ten out of ten. This will be one that is remembered for a long time.",Punch-Drunk Love
558,the_wiz_of_speed_and_time,Wow...what movie are you watching??,10,4 November 2002,"I've been reading all these comments about how amazing Punch-Drunk Love is. How Paul Thomas Anderson's new flick in another modern masterpiece. Well...I saw it, and I couldn't agree more.  If you thought there was no plot, what movie were you watching?  The movie I saw had a very delicate, intricate, and complicated plotline.  Sandler portrays the character of Barry Egan to a T.  His rage and hostility, shown in his other comedies (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Waterboy, etc.) had a purpose other than laughs this time.  The plot moved very quickly, and many things occurred in 90 minutes.  The amount of symbolism (Harmonium, blue refraction, phones, Atlas, Greek myths) made the film even more complex.  While I know the typical Sandler fan won't like it, many others will.  I have now seen it four times, and am glad to say that it DOES have a plot, it IS funny, and, in my opinion, is NOT stupid.  Sandler's complexity, mixed with Anderson's amazing directing and cinematography, topped off with great performances by Emily Watson and Phillip-Louis Seymour (albeit, his is shorter in comparison).  The cherry is the beautiful music composed by Jon Brion. My favorite film of the year so far.  A tip, though: Go in not knowing what to expect, and you will *hopefully* be surprised.Rating: *****/*****",Punch-Drunk Love
559,whsiii,My girlfriend would not let me walk out!,1,18 November 2002,"Try as I might, I can't see why anyone would like this movie. Although I tried to walk out, my significant other wanted to see it through. It was billed as Adam Sandler's serious and emotional break through on the screen. To me it was 1 1/2 hours of excruciating pain as a viewer. I kept on thinking it might get better, but what a disappointment. Listening to the audience when we left, I wasn't alone. Any woman who would want to have a serious relationship with the character he portrays definitely would need professional help. Yes he plays his part well, but so to what end? Sorry, guess I don't get it. I am an avid movie fan and although Adam Sandler is not one of my favorites, some of his films have been amusing. This one is neither fun/entertaining or satisfying. The only plus was my girlfriend was so embarrassed for picking the film, she would make it up to me.... As we say in Boca, OY!",Punch-Drunk Love
560,Louisemill,Huh???,1,15 March 2008,"To say this film was strange would be the biggest understatement. The storyline is almost non-existent. It seemed more like a catalogue of extremely random events happening to a highly unlikeable character. This is supposedly great filming technique and ""arty"" but a lot of it seemed just like bad (and often jerky) filming to me. There are parts of the film where literally nothing happens eg. when Egan is just waiting for the phone to ring. The sound track is weird and jarring - if the sound track had been different it might have been more bearable to watch. In real life Lena would have dumped Egan on the first date (or at least asked him why they were being asked to leave the restaurant!!). And what was the significance of the harmonium?? Why did he take it to Lena's flat and then the next minute he was playing it in his office again??? If you want a thought-provoking or inspiring film, or at least something mildly entertaining, THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM!!! In short, this film is boring, weird, has a highly irritating sound track, the characters lack depth, random things happen for seemingly no reason and there is no plot.Borrrrriiinnnnggg",Punch-Drunk Love

I can safely say that you will have a better time and feel that you have spent your money more wisely than going to see this excuse for a movie.This awful film should, quite frankly, have been released straight to DVD - preferably in one of the formats soon to be obsolete...The film starts oddly, which initially is quite appealing as you think it's going to be original, but sadly it remains odd for it's entire duration. This compounded with the fact that nothing actually happens in the movie and it never really gets started means the paint drying option above is definitely the way forwards.I read reviews that this film was excellent. My attitude to people who liked this film can easily be compared to that of a man, who upon leaving the cinema turned to his girlfriend and said, ""that was so deep"" to which she replied, ""no, it was s**t - you're just stupid""",Punch-Drunk Love

Again, I thought it was very, very obvious that the whole movie was a dream sequence.  The blue light throughout only contributed to the dream-like atmosphere.I happen to like this movie - it is the closest thing to an 'impressionist painting put on film' that I have ever seen.  Throw logic and plot out the window when watching and you'll be better off.

564,stain3565,Surprisingly good,9,29 July 2003,"Put simply, this is the first Adam Sandler film that I have ever enjoyed. I knew nothing of this film when I rented it, and was expecting nothing but the normal Sandler, simpering fool fodder.But this was different. I couldn't put my finger on why I liked the style, the off-kilter scenes where so little appeared to happen, other than a sense of the dysfunctional characters created by a quite ludicrous and yet entertaining plot. This was excellent.It was only as the credits rolled, that I realised why. Put a second rate comedic under-achiever in a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you get an enthralling view of the oddest love-story possible.This was not of the same class as the almost peerless Magnolia, but it was a good attempt. Hoffman as usual is underused, but at least Anderson has realised that he can light up a scene with so little effort. The sooner the rest of Hollywood wake up to this impressive talent, the better.As for Sandler, if he picks material like this in the future, I may get to like him! Maybe not!",Punch-Drunk Love
565,lkrieger,A great off-beat love story,9,20 October 2002,"P.T. Anderson has done it again with an original, off-beat love story.  Much more like ""Magnolia"" than ""Boogie Nights"" this touching story is told with a style and tone that could only belong to this up and coming director.  Going with Sandler with a role like this was definitely a risky choice, and Anderson pulls it off- and very well.  Be sure to catch this one as soon as you get a chance.The film is such a wonderful break from glossy studio pics that consume theaters.  The film definitely has it's faults, but I feel that Anderson was aware of them, and chose to ignore them, focusing instead on the core of the story.  Paul Thomas Anderson will undoubtedly be added to the list of great American directors before he is done.",Punch-Drunk Love
566,julesmck,Makes me want to punch somebody!!!,1,23 October 2002,"We are not talking bad here. We are talking awful. 'Punch Drunk Love' is a movie that begs to be consigned to the $10 ""Previously Viewed"" sales bin at Blockbuster.This is really two bad movies rolled into one. One bad movie is about a misfit with few redeeming qualities who miraculously finds love. Another bad movie is about con artists without motive taking advantage of lonely men. The director tries to liven things up with sudden loud noises, some yelling and a good ol' American beating with an iron pipe, but it never works. (And speaking of loud noises, the grating, overbearing soundtrack (bongo drums???) during the first half of the movie competed with the dialogue so much I could barely make out what people were saying. It was like trying to listen to a conversation while trapped in a pinball machine.)We are supposed to believe that an occasionally hyper-violent wacky introvert (Adam Sandler) is a babe magnet. We are supposed to believe that if bad guys terrorize you, rob you, smash up you, your car and your girlfriend it won't occur to you to call the police.The whole phone sex escapade seems to be a concoction to lengthen a very weak plot. We're supposed to think that a truck full of thugs travels all the way from Utah to California to soak some guy at a bank machine for $500???? This means they're getting paid $100 each! And they have to pay their own expenses! Which leaves a big $100 profit for the phone sex mastermind for committing a major felony that would get him several years in jail. And instead of letting Sandler go to the ATM alone, why wouldn't the thugs just get the bank machine code off Sandler and help themselves to his bank account? And why would the thugs smash up their own truck to hit Sandler's car? Geez, they're only getting paid about $1 an hour for their time. No one working for those wages would destroy their own vehicle.
And another thing: Adam Sandler's character is a struggling businessman who cannot afford to be robbed of $500, but can afford to book a last-minute flight to Hawaii that would cost him several thousand dollars. Huh?There is no chemistry between Sandler and Emily Watson. There is no plausible reason for Watson to so desperately want to be part of Sandler's life. None.If we were given more than cursory information about her character, maybe we might be able to come to some conclusions about her, but all we see is this very pretty woman who is hopelessly, inexplicably gaga over Sandler, no matter what objectionable behavior he dishes out, including abandoning her at the hospital after a car accident he indirectly causes because of his sex-line involvement. It makes no sense. At the end of the movie all we know about Watson is that she is a female and was married at one time. Maybe if we saw how she was also a hopeless, loser-klutz or something, we might begin to understand her attraction to him. Instead we are shown that she is a competent but lonely professional. It's so stupid.The whole thing with Sandler's sisters explains nothing about Sandler's violent character. So what if they're a bunch of stupid nags. Does that give him the right to smash their sliding glass doors in? Is destroying a restaurant bathroom supposed to be endearing? It would have been more plausible for Sandler to come from a string of foster homes.
In short, the U.S.S. Enterprise could fly through the holes in this thing. I just can't sit through something so badly conceived and be happy about it.
Fellow movie-goers looked exhausted coming out of the theatre. Comments were: 'Man, that sucked'; 'God, that was awful' etc.For masochists only.",Punch-Drunk Love
567,damer1,PT Anderson's Best Yet,10,20 October 2002,I thought that Boogie Nights was promising and that Magnolia was excellent but this movie show's PTA's full range as a Director.  I am not an Adam Sandler fan but think he excelled in the rol and was perfectly cast for the part.  Is the film quirky?  yes.  Is it funny?  yes it certainly is at points.  I think it's easily the best film I've seen this year.,Punch-Drunk Love
568,browns4-1,This is the best Adam Sandler movie ever made...,10,28 October 2002,"Adam Sandler did not have to team up with P T Anderson for Punch Drunk Love. He had just finished Mr. Deeds, which followed the typical formula of his genre of movies, and no doubt was highly profitable. Punch Drunk Love, on the other hand, was very different and extremely risky. Making this movie took courage and a degree of conviction so unexpected, it forces us all to reassess who Adam Sandler is. He is most definitely an actor of high caliber. In fact, I realize now that there is much more to Adam Sandler than meets the eye. I was not an admirer before, but I am now.",Punch-Drunk Love
569,nikapell,It's like a ride on a merry-go-round.,9,21 April 2003,"It was a while since I've seen a movie with such an original point of view on the most commonly represented matter, love. It was like you were taking a ride on a merry-go-round. Like you have been lifted up by those feelings, and as corny as it may seem, brought to that fairytale land where love does really conquer all.The story is about a guy who feels like his world is falling apart because of his loneliness and opressingly ordinary life. But suddenly in the middle of this madness he meets a woman who gives him some kind of extraordinary power to overcome all the obstacles that have come in his way. It feels like that love has build some kind of protective bubble around him, and in this bubble the world just seems more wonderful, colorful and magical, and nothing else matters to him anymore.I have never really liked Adam Sandler before this movie. Maybe it was because of his previous films, where roles have never really made him any justice. This role thought made me understand that he is really talented but never had a chance to prove it. Emily Watson is as charming as usual in her own sensitive way. But her character in this movie was not that developed so she was more or less left in the background, so we could concentrate more on Sandler's character.The way the movie was made had the most effect on me. I just simply adored Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, but I was still a bit reluctant to believe this was also a well-made movie, with a touch of originality, because I have also seen Boogie Nights, which didn't have the same effect on me as Magnolia. And still many say that it was Anderson's best film, so I thought maybe it applies to Punch Drunk Love too. Thank god I was wrong. This movie is one of those I really enjoy watching, and this is very rare for me lately since as many have probably noticed, the year 2002 hasn't produced many masterpieces. So I can definitely say that this is one of those rare good ones and certainly is worth of your time. Just watch it and decide yourself.",Punch-Drunk Love
570,lisa-1865,Fascinating and unique movie,10,10 November 2002,"People overuse the word ""quirky"" or ""offbeat"" but those terms are probably how most folks might characterize this movie.  It's a romance with moments of extreme violence, it's touching and sweet yet excruciating and cruel at the same time; it's beyond easy description.  If you're looking for a trite boy-meets-girl chick flick with cardboard characters and sitcom dialogue, this movie isn't for you.  But if you want a movie that will charm your eyes, engage your brain as well as your heart, and offer you things that you haven't seen a million times before onscreen, ""Punch Drunk Love"" is a movie you need to see.Sure, it's probably not for everyone, which should be reason enough to see it.  If you thought you didn't like Sandler, give him a try.  His performance is complex and always intensely watchable, and Emily Watson makes you take back every insulting remark you've ever made about dumb actresses.  She's wonderful.I'd see this movie again in a minute, and was utterly charmed by every moment of it.",Punch-Drunk Love

""Romantic comedy"" doesn't quite fully describe it: it has romance, and it has comedy, but it is not simplistic and treacly like most movies in that genre are. It is scary. It is sad (though never sentimental). The legions of people who never realized that Adam Sandler has great talent can now pick their chins up off the floor, and gawk in awe. My hope is that the great Sandler never makes another of those dopey movies he usually makes -- his true fans know that he saves his best stuff for his comeedy CDs anyway -- and that he will allow himself to be directed in the future by talents such as PT Anderson.",Punch-Drunk Love

The story is superbly told and photographed. Perhaps some of the best cinematography ive ever seen. The soundtrack is perfect; even those who don't like it, will agree that it works brilliantly in the film.The acting is also great, Adam Sandler especially. He gives a stronge, painful performance as the strange, anti-social Barry; who's going through an emotional crisis, due to the emotional abuse he suffers from his seven sisters. Emily Watson also plays her part well, as the rather proper Lena, who falls in love with Barry. Philip Seymour Hoffman also has a powerful cameo performance.",Punch-Drunk Love

This movie has moved me unlike any movie for the last 3 years. It is inspiring to see a troubled character like Egan develop and get the support/love he needs. Watson is also amazing as Sandlers love interest.See this movie!  It is unlike Hollywood!  Open your mind and enjoy PTA's Brilliant use of color, sound and photography.

574,knowan,"Great Acting, Aweful Movie",2,3 November 2002,"I've read some of the other comments people have made about this movie, and I just don't get it.  The movie has no plot, moves slower than a bull elephant swimming in molasses, and is full of plot ends which lead nowhere. There's even scenes where you're watching the main character sitting there doing nothing on screen.  That's it, he just sits there doing nothing, and you have to wait while he does it.Admittedly, the acting is very good.  It's just too bad that the script and directing is so bad.  Given that the actors have so little to work with it's surprising how good their acting is.  All the characters are two dimensional, and do not grow throughout the movie (with the possible exception of Adam Sandler).Yes I did catch some of the metaphors in the movie.  The car crash at the beginning pretty well represents Barry Egan's life.  Things are going along as normal, and then there's a sudden act of violence.  I'm not quite sure what the harmonium is supposed to represent except perhaps his salvation through his relationship with Lena.  Whenever Barry is particularly stressed, he will either cry, smash something, or play the harmonium.And I know this is supposed to be a love story, but what exactly does Lena see in Barry?  She saw his picture and somehow fell deeply, madly in love with him?  The only possible reason I can see for her to fall for him is the mothering instinct.  Her motives are never explained.  By the end of the movie I was wondering whether or not Lena really exists.  What with all the psycadelic cut scenes, perhaps the whole movie is nothing but one big acid trip.Although it's not the worst movie I've ever seen, it is the worst Adam Sandler movie that I've ever seen (and I've seen Mr. Deeds, so that's saying something).",Punch-Drunk Love

Feeling distinctly like two separate movies made for two reasons by two groups, you will spend the first hour wondering what it's about, the next fifteen enjoying the tension, and the next fifteen wondering how he can tell and end a story in under twenty minutes. Psychologically effective, this movie will somehow get you to like it, unless you go to the movies to sit there and have someone tell you an unoriginal story in a traditional manner.

577,morpheus27-1,An Adam Sandler film not to be ashamed to see,9,13 October 2002,"I had some high expectations for this film for some time, once I found out Paul Thomas Anderson would be working with Adam Sandler. And while the film, especially in the first half hour, is slow going, surreal and the cringe factor runs high, it really starts to pick up once Emily Watson is fully introduced. I've always liked Emily Watson and find her to be charming in practically every film she appears in. Some of the reviews are accurate however; PT Anderson really underwrote her part. I think I know why she falls for Sandler in the film, but it'd probably be a complete mystery to most people. Perhaps in the DVD, this aspect of her character might be more fleshed out as it is probably the only drawback to the film. Can't wait for the commentary. Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman are great in their small parts, too bad they're not in it more. But Sandler really stepped up to the plate and showed that he could pull off a challenging, complex role that required restraint rather than resorting to his formula characterizations. I won't run around saying he needs to get an Oscar nod, but I do think there's potential for the man. Bottom line, to paraphrase a quote from one of my favorite Simpsons episodes, ""It's funny, but not ha-ha funny.""

578,ladddc,A Fine Work of Art,10,22 October 2002,"This is a beautiful film.  Absolutely touching, penetrating, not always easy to watch, not always easy to find humor in, and at times very sad.  But infinitely rewarding and inspiring, like the rest of P.T.'s films.It's obvious that P.T. here chose to make a shorter film.  When it ended my first thought was ""God, Magnolia was at least twice as long!""  But the theme here is similar, as we see one man--who has been battered into social isolation by the coldness of the society (and family) around him--struggling to come to grips with a love that has appeared in his life almost miraculously (much like the oft-discussed harmonium).  Sandler is no more ready for this then most of us are the first time around--his first encounters with Emily Waston are as clumsy as his first try on the now famous instrument he discovers.His problems would only seem shocking to American audiences whose primary method of spiritual therapy is denial and who are accustomed to being force-fed formulaic ""romantic comedies"" with the likes of Meg Ryan, Jennifer Lopez, and Antonio Banderas.  He is somewhat of a hermit that feels incredibly uncomfortable in social situations that seem forced and somewhat fake.  How uncommon!  And he is so terrified of dealing with his pain and coming to grips with his overbearing and cruel sisters (who he loves) that he sublimates these feelings and lapses into occasional violent fits or crying spells.  Again, show me the man who has never punched a wall or a woman who has never cried for no apparent reason.What we have here is someone who is very much a real person, with inherent goodness and a desire to simply love and be loved without judgement.  This is why Emily Watson finds him so endearing--perhaps after a failed marriage and numerous relationships she simply wants someone who wants her unconditionally.  The unconventional, awkward, and anxiety-filled manner in which they ultimately come together brings many wonderful moments, such as their face-to-face scene in bed in Hawaii and the hysterical and dramatic final confrontation between Sander and Philip Seymour Hoffman (great as always).The cinematography and score in this film are terrific and P.T. makes wonderful use of color to convey emotion.  He is as bold in his craft here (but in more subtle ways) as he was with Magnolia.As a citizen of a country that has awarded its last four Best Picture oscars to Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, I feel blessed being able to see a film like Punchdrunk Love.  Whereas contemporaries like David Fincher and Christoper Nolan slipped somewhat on their most recent outings, P.T. has once again given us an incredible film and enriched American cinema (not very hard to do, admittedly).
If you are truly a romantic (and believe such stories do and can come true in the actual world), you will treasure this film.",Punch-Drunk Love

Well, the plot is fairly simple, and I think these people are reading too much into the definition of plot... ""plot"" is simply the events of a story - so the plot of 'Punch-Drunk Love' is everything from Barry discovering how he can accumulate frequent flier miles to the final ""Let's go"" that closes the picture. The story that the plot unfolds is something much deeper: a lonely man finds the answer to his problems through love. As for the ""it's not funny"" comment, I don't think it's supposed to be funny. Sure, there are some funny parts (after all, every movie has some form of comic relief), but I think it is being misclassified as a comedy. The people in the audience tonight laughed during the movie, but some still disliked it, mainly because it was ""too weird"" for them... people seem to be laughing out of discomfort - we're not sure what to feel, so we laugh.At a trim hour and a half, this whole movie is like momentum... once the introduction is finished, the movie builds all the way up to its ending, so those who say it's boring must have seen a different movie. Then there's the camerawork, which is some of the most inventive of recent time. Then the extremely long takes where either the camera stops moving and the character doesn't or the character stops moving and the camera doesn't... the light leaks to create the shafts of white or the little blue lines... the incredibly tense silences of discomfort... the growth of a man who had no control to someone who sees he has no control and then tries to get it... the constant unpredictability... I thought it was amazing.But I can see why others wouldn't see what I saw. Perhaps they want things explained more clearly, perhaps they want everything to come to a conclusion... well, this flick explains events only as far as Barry is involved or Barry understands, and the end of the movie is the climax to an unfinished love story... I thought each was a nice touch, but I could understand why others wouldn't.A beautiful, charming, strangely poignant picture that shows us (or me, at least) how fun it can be to sit back and just lose yourself in a movie.

P-D Love might be the greatest movie this layman has ever seen, and I didn't like it till the last five minutes when I realized what was really being said between the lines. The casting choice of Adam Sandler was a brilliant stroke, because he is so type-cast. His character doesn't change far from the type-cast here, but he's not trying to be funny. So you never know when something is truly humorous because of its ironic and unpredictable action, or whether it's the saddest thing you've ever seen because all you are doing is looking in a mirror looking back at yourself.If you've ever seen High Fidelity (2000, John Cusack, Jack Black) and thought you were able to understand the male thought pattern, P-D Love does an even better job symbolically portraying the modern American male and what he has become. The only difference here is that Sandler's Barry Egan wears his heart upon his sleeve. His emotion and the thoughts of his mind are given in the simple dialogue and his sporadic action or lack of it.If you want to know how a male thinks, this is the closest I've seen it ever in a movie.

I walked out of this film feeling much like i had seen my own life on the big screen, I was feeling overwhelmed by what i had seen. Its a disturbing feeling when you feel the character as much as i did. All those people who found it such a bad movie maybe never took into consideration the fact that there are people like this out there, this alone makes this story all the better. I actually went to watch this thinking it was going to be a lighthearted comedy starring adam sandler (the way he fell into his role was astonishing), i was wrong but very pleasantly surprised by what i saw.If you want ""Little Nicky"" or ""Billy Madison"", stay out of the theater while this one runs, but if you want something different and darkly beautiful, almost surreal, 8.50 could not be better spent.A trainwreck with few survivors, but how greatful are those that made it through safely.",Punch-Drunk Love
588,filmgate77-1,Punch-Drunk is what you need to be,1,14 November 2002,"After seeing `Magnolia' I am not much of a P.T. Anderson fan.  I find his work to be pretentious and odd for the sake of being odd, like a person who wants to be weird but is actually quit normal.except for the fact that he or she wants to be abnormal.  Having said that, to give him credit, I feel he works well with actors, he has a strong ability to intertwine plots, and he is often good with camera.  As far as `Punch-Drunk Love' is concerned, for an Anderson film, it is rather devoid of plot.  That is to say, there is only one plot and one subplot, unlike his usual five or so.  Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not which is the case with this film.  The subplot, while a bit outrageous, is quite funny and more logic based than the actual plot.  In the main plot the audience is supposed to believe that Lena (Emily Watson), after seeing a picture of Barry (Adam Sandler), supplied by his sister, Elizabeth (Mary Linn Rajskub), who only speaks badly of him, becomes so enamored by him that she is instantly devoted and understanding. This is regardless of the fact that he is laden with dysfunction and emotional instability, not to mention he wears the same suit every day. For all she knows he is a psychopath.  Now if Lena were equally as quirky or troubled it would make more sense, like a couple of lonely people who were meant to be.  She is, instead, highly functional which makes the plot seem more like an adolescent boy's fantasy of having a woman take care of him by saving him from his turmoil.Fortunately, the acting was great.  Emily Watson is always good to amazing and Adam Sandler's performance was a nice surprise.  Then, of course, there was Mary Linn Rajskub who stole the show every time she was on screen. Unlike the fine acting, the technical aspects were unfortunate.  After the high production value of `Magnolia,' it would seem the follow up film would not be so lacking and, yet, poor focus, clumsy camera moves, and inconsistent lighting are scattered throughout.  Sometimes films can get away with these types of problems, but only if it is not distracting. In `Punch-Drunk Love' it's distracting.`Punch-Drunk Love,' has received a lot of praise.  Perhaps it is because of Adam Sandler's metamorphosis into a dramatic actor, even though there are plenty of actors who do it every day.  It could be that pretension is baffling and blinding.  Or, perhaps, it is because of P.T. Anderson, a director who people probably often don't fully get, but say he is deep to avoid looking unintelligent.  I do not believe a narrative director/ writer should be condescending to the audience by making simple asinine films a monkey could follow.  But, it is the responsibility of the filmmaker to supply enough elements for the audience to pull it together themselves. Anderson does not seem to want to do that and it hurts the quality of his storytelling.  For example, can anyone explain why in `Punch-Drunk Love' there are random cuts to watercolor like images?  This is not the kind of film that supports the use of a visual to represent a curtain fall before going into the next act.  Nor does it seem to be a projection from the mind of one of the characters.  No, it's just there.  All their awful presence did for me was lead to flashbacks of frogs falling from the sky (Courtesy of `Magnolia').I think the use of the word `Punch-Drunk*' in the title sums it all up, because that is what Lena would have to be to go for Barry, and because that is what the audience would have to be to truly buy this film.* Webster's Dictionary -- suffering cerebral injury from many minute brain hemorrhages as a result of repeated head blows received in boxing",Punch-Drunk Love

The best way to go into a movie is to be clueless about it.  I was clueless about this movie and what I found out when I watched it was that its style, acting, and plot were just great.Sure Lena inexplicably likes the seemingly psychotic and troubled Barry...but that is how girls (and guys) are, people can't be summed up and categorized, good thing movies can.  And this one deserves to be summed up into the ""great"" category.Watch this movie if you have been through puberty and you'll understand how Barry feels.  Another user identified with his feelings and admitted that he had never destroyed a bathroom, I am the same way and most guys are, this movie does a wonderful job of portraying these feelings and magnifying them.

592,KCPhaid,Not a comedy and no romance in it. This movie failed.,1,25 January 2004,"Some have called this the worst movie ever.  at this time I have to agree with this opinion.  I thought 'I'm losing you' was bad, but this was worse.1) It is listed a romantic comedy.  Nothing in this movie is funny.  No opinion here mentions any aspect of humor or comedy existing in this movie. 2) The story line is not Romanic.  There is no romance nor does the movie put you in nor add to a romantic mood.Therefore, this movie bad or good can be agreed upon to be a failure in its mission to be a romantic comedy.  If romantic or comedy that is what you are looking for, this is not the movie.What it is, is a poor portrayal of a glimpse into mental illness and poor social skills.  It does not even handle that subject with reality nor believability.  See Rainman if that is your interest.The only thing it does do is have symbolism, for the sake of symbolism. It does succeed at this slightly as it has generated a lot of 'I know more than you, because I noticed blah blah blah' talk.  The kind of black turtleneck in the coffeehouse talk that is tripe.  If you are interested in symbolism, visit your local coffee house and ask the beatnik reading Catcher In The Rye.The only 2 interesting thing that it could have done, but did not, was; 1) Explain his metal issues by telling us, what happened that day in his childhood with the hammer.  We might then know, what the origin of his trouble was, but I believe this type of character depth to be beyond this screenplay. 2) Explain why the girl was interested in him after seeing the picture of him with all of his sisters?  Was it because she was a lonely only child and really just wanted to be one of the sisters?  Again even this simplistic character depth would be too much for this story.In summary good, bad, or ugly this movie is a definitive failure.  I am glad I bought it used.  Now if I can just give it away before everyone catches on.  Yes that is a little bit of a hammer, but they introduced it, and I was the only one who figured out how to use it.KCMojo",Punch-Drunk Love

Barry Egan (Adam Sandler) a salesman very lonely, sad and angry meets beautiful Lena Leonard (Emily Watson) and falls in love with her. The plot is simple but the director Paul Thomas Anderson has managed to transform ""Happy Gilmorish"" Adam Sandler into an unforgettable character, Barry Egan. When he is angry we feel angry and when he is happy we are happy.Adam Sandler has managed to give his best performance till date breaking his typecast role. This movie is all about Adam Sandler. It has managed me to re-consider his other movie after watching this movie. We may have underestimated Adam Sandler. Though this movie is taken in L.A you would not see the scenery of the L.A. The director has managed to capture the feelings of main character and let us submerge into it. He doesn't want us to be bedazzled by CGI effects and beautiful imagery. This film is going to break the heart of die-hard fan of Adam Sandler weirdo and nerdy movie.

598,jonny15,Not Your Typical PTA Film,9,13 March 2005,"I'm a huge fan of Paul Thomas Anderson, and being a young guy, I was very interested to hear that he was doing a movie with Adam Sandler. Needless to say, this is neither your typical Sandler or PTA film.Sandler shows an acting ability that I didn't know he had, and he does a phenomenal job with the character. It makes me happy to see him do so well in the film, and it's hard to imagine someone else in the role.Also, we finally have a PTA film that isn't a three hour emotional epic. Now, that doesn't mean I don't enjoy those films (Magnolia is my favorite film of all time), but it's nice to have a short film from him that doesn't leave you feeling emotionally exhausted. Many directors try to evoke emotions and feelings out of the viewers, and mostly, those emotions are feelings of extreme love, happiness, or even sadness. However, PTA uses the first half of the film to create a sense of urgency and agitation, and I've never seen a director do such a good job of creating such a response. PTA makes us feel sympathy for Sandler's character by making us feel the same anger and frustration that he feels toward his sisters and other things.I like Sandler, I love PTA, and together they made a very entertaining film. It's not life-changing or absolutely outstanding, but it's a very beautiful film (specifically the colors and settings), and it's a very good, quirky comedy/drama.9/10",Punch-Drunk Love

However, less than 30 minutes into it I was consumed with the urge to leave the theatre. Sitting between my two friends it would not have been polite so I sat it out. If I could have beamed myself out of there I would have.This film comprises of a few unconnected ideas, strung together with annoying music and pointless psychadelic screen transitions. The characters are woefully underdeveloped, in particular the female role of Lena.I'm at a complete loss as to why anyone would describe this film as a romantic comedy because it is neither romantic nor funny.Punch-Drunk's biggest failing is that viewers are given no chance to connect with the characters.

600,purplerose11,Another Gem from the Brilliant P.T. Anderson,10,20 October 2003,"Punch-Drunk Love is one of those rare films that gets better with each viewing.  I have now seen it twelve times.  Every time I watch it, I pick up things I didn't notice the time before; the scene in which Barry gives the thugs his money reaches its peak as he explains to them that he is giving up a substantial chunk of money, only to end his explanation with a hopeful, ""99 cents!"", as he sees a deal at a restaurant across the street.  I saw the film eleven times before I heard him say that. There are so many great scenes in Punch-Drunk Love.  People often talk of scenes that they deem worthy of being put in a time capsule. The scene that stands out in my mind as being nearly perfect is the sequence in which Barry tries to track down Lena in Hawaii, with ""He Needs Me"" playing in the background. I was filled with such joy the first time I saw that. I now have a goofy smile on my face each time I watch that scene.  That goes for the rest of the movie too.",Punch-Drunk Love
601,RedSoxFan,1 Part Artistic Love Story + 1 Part Sensory Overload,6,29 June 2003,"Equals a so-so movie.In a performance role that is perfectly (blue) suited for Adam Sandler, I found myself trying too hard to enjoy what I was seeing.
Now, let me start by saying that I truly enjoy movies that are a little outside of the box. Stories that don't quite fit into the mold of formulaic Hollywood tales.I also enjoy movies that try different ways to tell their stories using visual experimentation that you may not see in standard fare.I even occasionally enjoy when the director tries to offer us a different type of aural experience that we may not be used to.Yet when you add all of these elements into one movie at the same time, it can be too much for the viewer to handle.The first barrier PT Anderson and Sandler ask for us to breakdown is to accept the fact that this is not an ""Adam Sandler"" movie. We will not be experiencing any goofball antics or low brow comedy. Instead we get to see Sandler raw and exposed. In fact, the Sandler we see in this film, is probably closer to who the real Adam Sandler is, as opposed to the caricatures we get in movies like Big Daddy or Mr. Deeds. So for me it is not to hard of a barrier to overcome, but for the under 18 crowd expecting the next Billy Madison, return the DVD to Blockbuster before you pop it in and see if you can get your money back.Next you must be able to hurdle the visual presentation. There is a lot going on, even when there is nothing going on. Harsh whites are contrasted with deep blues. The camera pulls in tight, then wavers. In certain scenes we see nothing but silouettes. In the end we feel that we have been presented a very sterile world, in which emotion is repressed to the point that it boils over in to anger.And it is the audio experience of the anger building to a symphonic discord that, to me, proved to be the movie's failing point. While trying to process what we are seeing and the story being told to us, we are assaulted with broken chords, the sounds of clattering, and power tools. At times the ""music"" overpowers the dialog and we can almost feel the anger and the frustration Sandler's character is experiencing. While it is an effective technique, it does not make it any more enjoyable to listen to. In fact at times it is down-right uncomfortable and unwatchable.I feel that each sensory experience is effective in its own right. But when combined into one experience, makes for a grating movie.",Punch-Drunk Love

603,frasermummery,No more toilet humor from this toilet brush salesman.,8,8 August 2003,"Barry Eagan, a small-time toilet brush salesman struggles through life's insecurities and the dangers of phone sex.The stimulus came from a Time Magazine article about one David Phillips. It seems Phillips, a University of California civil engineer, came across a loophole in a Healthy Choice/American Airlines promotion, enabling him to accumulate well over a million frequent flyer miles by purchasing $3,000 worth of pudding cups.Knowing a good jump-off point when he sees one, Anderson optioned the man's story and combined it with a tale of his own, emerging with a buoyantly unpredictable, true original.Representation is key to understanding the narrative structure of the movie, the car crash at the beginning of the film symbolises that something is about to crash into Barry's world, something that will change his existence and scare the hell out of him.Also as the catalyst of Barry's change enters the movie we are then presented with the most puzzling of props - a harmonium. As this is shown to us at the same time as the love interest we can only assume that the musical instrument is used to represent the harmony found between two people when they fall in love, or in a slightly more cheesy way, the music they make together. We also see Barry using the harmonium for support at times of stress, while he's on the phone to the villain of the movie for instance, and in another scene we see him covering up a tear in the fabric of the harmonium with duct tape, essentially patching things over and making them stronger.There is no mistaking the exceeding creativity that has gone into nearly every shot, transition, narrative choice and musical selection.
Fans of Sandler's numbskull persona from past films may find this a disappointment, or a bit over their heads, however, if you like smart filmmaking and a opportunity to re-evaluate the worth of one of Hollywood's `artists' then go and see this movie.

The answer for me was ""no""; it felt like an LA-made bad Woody Allen funny sequence on repeat.  I could not care about the characters for long and watched with limited and distant amusement the ""F**k you"" phone sequence, but was otherwise generally bored.  The film could not settle for a moment, even during the interesting restaurant sequence with E. Watson.

This movie has a completely different look, feel, and way of story telling from any other movie I've seen. It is extremely ambitious, and whether it achieved what the director was trying to or not, that ambition can be appreciated by the viewer. Adam Sandler gives such a convincing performance, that I am half convinced that his behavior in the film must reflect how he is by himself in reality. Nobody could so accurately display such a hesitant awkwardness, without genuinely owning those characteristics in their real life. I was completely taken back by his performance. Oh the dramatic role pursuits of great comedians like Ferrell (Everything Must Go), Carrey (Eternal Sunshine), and Murray (Lost in Translation), personally I find Sandler's pursuit in this film to be the best of all. You can become immersed in his characters sadness, desperation, frustration, and passion. It is not the type of performance you see everyday, and this is not your everyday movie.

Many people call this movie a ""Dark Comedy"" or a ""Romantic Comedy"" but I really don't see the comedy or humor in this at all, but I do see the darkness. Sure there were a couple of parts that'll make you chuckle a bit like the window kicking and bathroom thrashing scenes but I don't think those scenes were meant to be funny. Adam Sandler is one of the funniest actors around but this movie proves he can really act. Plus aside from the dark elements of the movie, I also found it to be very romantic and I honestly really do not like romance movies unless if I have someone to watch them with but this movie I can watch and just be fascinated by it.

Nice lead character...really draws in the audience. His female counterpart, Lena Leonard, is also a nutjob...a doe-eyed, ditzy nutjob...but nutjob none-the-less.I found this quote amusing. ""Much of the joy of ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is that you never truly know where the movie is going to go next."" I'll say! This movie is like a bloody, 5 car pile-up on the interstate. You don't really want to look, but you can't seem to turn away because deep down inside, you really want to see how bad it can get.If any of you poor victims of this movie bought it on DVD, congratulations. You bought a nice coaster.This is the perfect example of someone with too much money, and too much time on their hands who decides to make a weird movie.Drek.",Punch-Drunk Love
617,ronda-k,A horrible and pointless film,1,17 May 2005,"I saw this in the theater when it first came out. It is #1 on my 'most hated movies' list.When it was over, I literally stood up and said to the entire audience ""I'm am so glad that's over."" From the reactions of the audience, I was not the only one that was relieved.The number of positive reviews I've read here baffles my mind. There was not a single redeeming quality. Not, the acting, not the story, nothing. I enjoy 'artistic' movies and movies that take a leap, but this was just horrible  no, it was excruciating. It was an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.My advice don't bother. Seriously.",Punch-Drunk Love
618,lupp0,What the ****,1,14 December 2015,"How can people rate this so high? I really don't understand it.. at all..I love many types of movies, I really do. Sometimes the ""weird/art"" movies are the best, and I will watch them no matter what/how people rate them..But this movie was just bad, in many ways. And i'm just speechless, clueless is the better word probably, as to why this movie gets such an high rating. This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a very VERY long time.I was really hoping to see a movie, with Sandler, which showed some acting skills that he normally doesn't portrait. That is the only thing I will take from this movie! I would give it a zero rating if I could, just horrible.2 options here:1) I missed ""the point"" -which I hardly never fail to miss- 2) This was just -like I said before- one of the worst movies I've ever seen.I will go for 2 on this one.. This is no ""art"" movie, it's just a very crappy one.. pfffff!!!",Punch-Drunk Love
619,StephenPitts,"Thrilling, Neurotic, Visceral.",7,30 December 2014,"This movie is one of the best films, and quite possibly the very best, to come out of the 2000s. It is billed as a romantic-comedy, but never once did I view it as such. I viewed it as a very suspenseful,visceral,psychological thriller. Each and every shot was executed so brilliantly, it was neurotic, and kept my brain tingling and my eyes darting all over the place. It kept me thinking, long after the film ended. It warns the dangers of talking to strangers,so it's like a Public Service Announcement not to talk to strangers but to also stand up for yourself and those you care about. Usually,I cannot stand the cheese of romance films. But obviously, since I didn't view this as a romance film,I had a different experience. But it was much more than that, it made me feel like Adam Sandler's character finally had a reason to give a heck. Finally a reason to leave behind his inhibitions and just take responsibility to the max. Rating: Solid 10/10.",Punch-Drunk Love
620,magma-man,The very definition of a beautiful movie,10,21 April 2006,"Punch Drunk Love is one of those movie that you keep commenting about it 3 weeks after you watched it, it contains such a beautiful message that even your perspective about life will change. With a brilliant direction, visually astonishing (with and indie look) and a great performance by the hand of Adam Sandler, you will literally fall in love with this movie. The characters are so unique (like every Anderson's character), Sandler character is like a modern Dr. Jekyll and Mr. hide, who portraits his anger in a unique form. This movie explores a lot about human mind, the path to monstrosity and love feelings. A must see! 10/10",Punch-Drunk Love
621,LateNightBrain,One of Paul Thomas Anderson's best!!!,10,23 May 2016,"Could there be a more unlikely romantic comedy film than Punch Drunk Love? (Warning! Long sentence below!)Be it the central character's obsession with pudding and frequent flyer miles, his constant lying (and not being very good at it), his awkward disposition and unease with himself, the battle with getting his words right, his sudden outbursts of rage due to years of repressed feelings and bullying from his seven obnoxious sisters, his unusual trade as a distributor of gimmick toilet plungers, the trouble he lands himself in after a late night call with a phone sex operator, or his quest to find love in a world that presents itself more bizarre and chaotic by the minute... this movie is just pure magnificence. Yes, it may not be for everyone. But, for those who are open minded and like their films with a more unconventional touch, do yourself a favor and watch Punch Drunk Love. Watch it at night when you've got 90 minutes to spare. The acting, the camera work, the soundtrack/score, the colors, and most importantly the heart it comes from is a piece of work that has no rival in the vast land of cinema.One of the 10 films I will take to my grave. xo",Punch-Drunk Love
622,smoshwa-movies,Lovely Anxiety,9,14 September 2019,"I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. It feels purposeful in every shot and in every line of dialogue throughout its short runtime. Paul Thomas Anderson did a very good job writing and directing this film.The cinematography is very beautiful with all of the various colors and various shot choices that are throughout the film. Adam Sandler has his best performance that I have ever seen from him in this film and the character fits him very well. All of the other performances from the cast are also quite good, but Adam's character is a standout for me.I particularly like the soundtrack that is used. It provokes feelings of anxiety once it really picks up and also feels very organic. The sounds within the background often come into the foreground and cause those feelings of anxiety, overwhelming the viewer.The film follows a typical romantic comedy storyline in an atypical way. This is because the interactions the characters have are often particularly unnerving, and for this reason, this film may not be for the typical romantic comedy watcher. The interactions and events that take place feel very real despite not being entirely realistic. It may not have been literally realistic but was very real in terms of honesty.For me personally I really felt invested in this film and connected a lot to the main character and his feelings of anxiety, his inability to lie, and his social ineptness. For these reasons of relatability and the other qualities of the film I mentioned it really resonates with me and will hopefully continue to.",Punch-Drunk Love
623,jlcpaulson,One of the stupidest and most annoying movies I've ever seen,1,22 July 2017,Hate these characters and the plot. But what is even worse is the soundtrack. For some viewers perhaps it is engaging to see Adam Sandler in this role or they are intrigued by the quirky story but this was not an enjoyable movie experience. No resemblance to real life or real people.,Punch-Drunk Love
624,mudarinfo,Boring and simple,6,6 March 2019,The tempo of the movie is very slow with a very typical love story. The whole family can watch it as its very simple with no profound meanings. Other than that the performance of the main characters was great.,Punch-Drunk Love
625,amol,A film about the anxieties of modernity,10,28 October 2002,"This is an excellent film, and worthy of much praise. I'll try to add one dimension I haven't seen in the reviews here on IMDb. Obviously, the ""this movie was pointless"" people are missing something. But so are the ""this was a great movie, but it seemed to lack a core"" folks.The movie plays to the genre of romantic-comedy. And much of the film tests this formats many conventions, but also enriches them. Why do these two goofy characters fall in love? Not much more reason than in any Julia Roberts film really -- that is, for no more reason than the craziness of love.But the central themes is not at all love. Part of what turned me on to this was a reviewers comment that PT Anderson had credit French master Jacques Tati with much of his inspiration for this film; the reviewers guess that Anderson meant Tati's Playtime was dead on. Tati is known for his Monsieur Hulot, the bumbling, french everyman that stumbles through his films. In some, he is nearly a sweet, Chevy-Chase-from-National-Lampoons slapstick figure. In Playtime, Hulot confronts the ultra-clean, ultra-shoddy, ultra-alienating landscape of modern life. He walks into glass walls and gets trapped in big flows of rushing people.PDL's Barry Egan is a sweet, goofy everyman. But he can't cope with his overbearing world. He's clearly suffering from some kind of anxiety-disorder. He freaks out in the films first scene after receiving just a few words from a pretty stranger, and in the next scene his sister is chastising him for not getting out enough. In these one-on-one scenes, Sandler unveiling Egan's most intimate identity, are incredibly authentic and moving. Later on, when Egan asks the angry restaurant maitre d' (after Egan has smashed up the b bathroom) ""please don't do this to me, please let me stay"", it is the image of a childlike, naive inability to grasp the seriousness of the world and its consequences.The camera moves restlessly and the music keeps striking up nervous energy because you're meant to feel that way. When Barry first talks to this strange, attractive woman in his office -- the scene is a torrent of confusion and disquietude. I felt like Barry must have felt: nervous, confused, distracted, anxious.Egan is alone and uncertain of how to deal with modern life. Sitting in his vast, bleak warehouse office, he is in the situation of many Americans. The night when the thugs whisk him off his suburban street, and leave him running desperately around the deserted subdivisions and shopping malls of LA, I understand why he feels so scared. Among all the concrete walls and customer service numbers and marketing promotions,  who really cares about you? And when the world turns hostile, when its anonymity is used against you by sinister people, who can protect you?Lucky for Barry Egan, he finds someone to love him.",Punch-Drunk Love
626,noelle-5,please do better next time...PLEASE,3,20 October 2002,"Perhaps its my fault for idealizing Paul Thomas Anderson to such a degree. Perhaps its Adam Sandler's fault for gringing so much cheap baggage into his role.  Who am I kidding?  It is P. T. Anderson's fault for making a horrible movie.  I love his previous work and this was seriously a disappointment. Every aspect of the film was weak and careless.  There wasn't even a license plate on Emily Watson'd car!!  Also, the plot was tedious and negative.  I don't think that random violence can ever be charming.  Sandler's character was not only frightening, but flat and without purpose.  Was he sad?  Was he angry?  Was he in love?  I was only half convinced of any of these emotions. Please do better next time.  please",Punch-Drunk Love

We thought that the dialogue was very poor and the music throughout the movie was irritating and obnoxious. I started thinking that maybe the movie was developed to annoy the hell out of the audience for entertainment. We looked around the theater and saw people leaning forward in their seats and touching their faces in annoyment. We wanted to get up and walk out but were pretty much trapped in the middle, so we stayed through the end. This is not your typical Adam Sandler movie, so be prepared! We want our money back!!! Beware!",Punch-Drunk Love

I don't normally write about films on IMDB but I need to warn people just how bad the film is. Just because Adam Sandler's acting is spot on does not in anyway make the film worth watching. Don't worry if you miss this film!,Punch-Drunk Love
630,steve_tait_1999,Not at all what you would expect,9,7 February 2003,"Having enjoyed PT Andersons two previous films Magnolia and Boogie Nights for their sprawling storylines and their expansive casts- I certainly wasn't expecting PDL to be such a completley different experience. For a start PDL clocks in at just 90 minutes, under half that of Magnolia, and includes Adam Sandler in the lead role. Sandler, who is a huge star in the US, yet not as popular elsewhere is superb as the lead character Barry Egan.Anderson has created a film that is visually stunning- the way that some of the scenes are shot is quite startling, and with another excellent cast (which includes Anderson's buddies Luis Guizman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman who are both excellent) and a touching ending. This film is perhaps a little too odd for a Valentines chick-flick, as some of the humor is just not what you would expect from a romantic comedyAll in all, worth 90 minutes of anyones time",Punch-Drunk Love

632,IsakBodin,The stuff dreams are made of.,10,29 January 2003,"I saw Punch Drunk Love at the Gothenburg film festival today and I was totally overwhelmed by it. I had really looked forward to it since I love Paul Thomas Anderson's earlier films. Magnolia is still among my top five favourite movies ever and my expectations were therefore almost too high. I must admit I was sceptical of Adam Sandler playing a serious part. But he makes fantastic interpretation of his character Barry Egan, a small business owner pushed around by his seven (!) sisters  who's miserable life takes a turn when he meets love in Emily Watson's character. Watson makes a beautiful portrait of the mysterious and lonely Lena who falls in love with Barry.The movie isn't just well acted, it's also magnificent to watch. The camerawork is exquisite and Anderson really shows of his visual talent. Every frame in the one and a half hour film could be frozen and displayed as a piece of art. But the most impressive thing in the film is still Adam Sandler. Every word, expression and nuance is perfect and genuine. If this doesn't deserve an Oscar nomination I don't now what will. His performance is superior to the last five winners.Punch Drunk Love is the way a movie should be. It's the way you wish all movies were like and I wish I could hang it on my wall. The poster will have to do.",Punch-Drunk Love
633,moviefan_Gill,This movie leaves you emotionally drained. You'll love it!,10,24 October 2002,"The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, never fails to bring you emotions wrought directly at the core of every character. In this movie he truly does not disappoint.Just as full of human weakness, as Boogie nights was. Just as deep and fulfilling at its climax, as Magnolia was. This movie proves what a talent Adam Sandler is and what he is truly capable of.As Barry Egan, Sandler plays a character almost on the edge of oblivion. Barry's life is tortured and lonely. As the story begins, we see him in a suit that does not fit his tattered surroundings. All in a effort to feel better about the small life he leads. His only enjoyment comes from a harmonium that appears ""on his doorstep.""His problems stem from his childhood, growing up with seven nagging, bullying sisters. They emotionally torture this generally meek guy toward fits of rage.I don't want to give too much away. But the story leads Barry to a more happy and fulfilling place and though it takes us on a twisted journey, this movie is all about the third act, when Barry finds out that he truly has the strength to be a better person.",Punch-Drunk Love

If you've seen this movie, you know which scene I'm talking about.  I spent the entire movie scratching my head and saying, ""what is going ON here?""  It was a confusing, mindless, meaningless collage of pure stupidity.  What a waste of film and time!  And money!  There is no plot development, no climax, it does not get you involved with the characters and leaves you completely baffled as to what the heck you just watched as you're sitting watching the credits roll on.

Suffice it to say that Paul Thomas Anderson has made another masterpiece, and that Adam Sandler can act.  Simply put, this movie is brilliant.  Anderson has the power to absorb an audience in his beautiful movies, as long as you don't let the loud guffaws of Waterboy fans distract you (though I don't blame Sandler, whose performance is a must-see-to-believe) because, trust me, some people did NOT get the memo. See this movie for its absolute brilliance.  Yes, I used that word twice. But brilliant is the only possible word to use when describing a true piece of art.

I'm happy to say that he did not disappoint me.  This movie joins the other unremarkable excrement that he's turned out to date, and takes it to a higher level, giving the audience 95 minutes of pointless wandering nonsense, no plot, no motive, no reason for being.  What a total waste of film stock.  Never has Shakespeare's line ""full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"" been given such perfect meaning.  If you're thinking about going to see this movie, do the following instead:  go have a combo at your favorite burger place, and send what's left over from the price of the movie ticket to a deserving charity.

When the waitress came by to bring him his order, I heard her ask him about the crossword puzzle he was doing. ""Yeah, I find it's a lot easier to do the longer words first, then you can kind of work your way out from there. But sometimes I just can't solve the longer ones, and the shorter ones can help with those."" There was something about this exchange that was inexplicably heartbreaking, so much so that it's stuck in my brain almost ten years later.

When he meets an elfin British woman, he realizes there is more to embrace in his life than let go of...Anderson has a flair for building drama of an endearing kind around characters that are lovable, precisely because of their quirkiness. With quirkier situations and an inspired, original score from Jon Brion to boot, it's quite a feast for those that seek an alternative to celluloid projections of humanity.

But after sitting through the first 60 minutes of it I reached to a conclusion that I wasted one hour of my life on it and I fast forwarded the last 30 minutes just to see if there was anything interesting in it at all. The scenes where Phillipp and Adam interacted with each other were the only interesting parts of this movie and there was a couple of minutes worth of this interaction.In short, I wouldn't even recommend this movie to my worst enemy.",Punch-Drunk Love

A lack of a story leads to a truly boring film, and this one is painfully boring.It did not have an ending, but thankfully, it did eventually end.Adam Sandler can act, but I already knew that. This movie proved that he cannot choose a decent script, though.I think PTA was trying to be original. Well, congratulations on that success. Original, but not at all entertaining.There are so many scenes that leave you wondering ""What was that for?"" So, you hold on to the thought that the ending will clarify everything.

649,kwasshole1980,A movie about nothing,1,6 September 2006,"Paul Thomas Anderson is probably one of the most over-rated directors in Hollywood. This film proves the point. He overkills on camera work, symbolism and fore-shadowing to hide a horrible script. Granted, he has a vast knowledge of film tricks and techniques, but this does NOT make him a good director. It just shows he knows how to use a camera. Personally, I think this movie was a waste of film and I was glad I borrowed it instead of renting it. This is, however, only my opinion. I can see why people would like this movie and enjoy more of his work. I would never own this, Magnolia or Boogie Nights though. I can only stand so much blatant plagerism.",Punch-Drunk Love
650,ColdplayBK,Odd but fantastic,9,26 October 2002,"This was most likely the most refreshing PT Anderson film I've seen to date. The darkest humor, the most awkward feelings, the most subtle brilliance Anderson has put into a picture thus far.For those of you who complain about plot holes, you shouldn't have bothered watching this film. This film isn't about what the henchmen SHOULD'VE done to get more than 500 bucks out of Barry Egan, it's sad that people can't understand the concept of intended ridiculousness (much like The Big Lebowski).This is Anderson's artsiest film yet, extremely Avante-Garde in its aesthetics. He uses a handheld masterfully where it's not expected to be used. The cinematography is brilliant, and yet Anderson frequently slips in entire sequences of subtle handheld shots to give the viewer an extremely nervous and agitated feeling that works wonderfully with the plot. For those of you who left early because you didn't feel right about this film, you weren't alone because that sort of feeling was put in this film on purpose (you just aren't film literate enough to understand WHY you felt so put off by watching this)In short, I know this movie will be widely insulted, and I know my theater wasn't the only one to have quite a few people get up and walk out halfway through. But for those of us who understand PT Anderson, and great film in general, we'll continue to look out for movies like this one in the future. What a great faux-indie release",Punch-Drunk Love

I don't usually do this but I really feel compelled to do this. I have to warn every one that this movie has undoubtedly the most annoying and disconcerting music ever. It is not ear-piercing like Armageddon, I went thru that movie just fine and I have never had problem with bad movie music, but this one is just the worst ever by a wide margin. My words failed me in trying to describe the ugliness of it. I imagine that this is the director's way of trying to convey the mental states of Sandler and I suppose this was successful, it left me with painful headaches. If you really have to see this movie, at least rent a DVD so you can turn off the sound and just read the caption. Aside of the hideous music, the plot was somewhat inane and the acting was okay.

654,jonlarson99,"Wonderful, unique movie full of human truth.",9,27 October 2002,"Adam Sandler stepped far outside of any movie role he ever attempted before. He makes this movie work. Sandler plays Barry Egan, who is a pathetic, lonely and troubled bachelor whose seven sisters never allow him to have a normal life. The unique neurotic behavior of this character is really what makes this movie excellent. Egan's sisters never allow him to live down childhood incidents and seem to betray his personal confidence so often that it makes Egan repress his anger so often that he occasionaly flips out. Barry has to deal with a ridiculous shakedown from a phone sex operator (like they would need the extra money,) while struggling to put things together and be honest in winning Lena's heart. Lena, who seems like a perfectly normal woman seems to fall in love with Egan for who he is. He needs her because she will never betray his confidence.  She loves him because he needs her. This movie is so well done and so well written because it is so TRUE. Anyone who sees this movie will definitely identify with aspects of both Egan and Lena.",Punch-Drunk Love
655,locutys2,This movie was terrible,1,1 December 2002,"I had high expectations going into this movie and was very disappointed. This just proves once again the fact that even if a movie has a good pedigree, which this movie certainly did, it can still be a terrible film. I have felt for a long time that most movie critic's opinions do not reflect my opinions and tastes.  I should have realized that when the critics began raving about this film that I would find it to be terrible.  I did not walk out of the theater prior to the ending of this film but I certainly came close to bolting from the theater.  My advice is, run; don't walk, away from this film as fast as you can!",Punch-Drunk Love
656,shellybelly,perfect,10,25 October 2002,"Reading some peoples' comments about this film, I'm not sure I understand why they hated it so much. Why do you need a reason for Lena to fall for Barry? Love just happens. Its unexplainable-I'm still scratching my head over my guy. I also read that there were holes? Where? The guys from Utah thought Barry was loaded and had planned on stealing more than $500. Not to mention that they weren't the brightest of brothers... I thought Punch-Drunk Love was as perfect as any movie can get. I haven't felt such gut-wrenching intensity since..well, since P.T.'s last movie. I never would have believed Adam Sandler could do anything more than stick french fries up his nose. Don't get me wrong, I am generally a Sandler fan, but the extent of emotions or the inner torment of his characters haven't really gone beyond..well, sticking french fries up his nose. Thankfully he has proven me wrong. Adam Sandler can act. Emily Watson is still fabulous. Philip Seymour Hoffman remains one of my favorite actors. Paul Thomas Anderson remains one of the best filmmakers.",Punch-Drunk Love

Embarrassed at his own behavior, struggling with bouts of self-loathing, Barry shifts between recklessly acting out and trying to lie his way out of awkward moments he's created. Alas, he is sold out regularly by his sisters, who drive him crazy but mean well and ultimately charm Lena into a boundless patience for their brother's weird ways.Brilliant art direction and a terrific score combine with a distinctive mise en scène to form a daring overall style.Punch-Drunk Love plays in a world of 99 cent stores and cultural fall-out.

659,dougiestyles,This is a good film.,8,20 October 2002,"This was a great film.  The cinematography was incredible.  And the plot was so out of this world that it really made you think about how hollywood has become so conformist.The theatre I went to wasn't full, and about 4 couples walked out throughout the movie.  What made it so great was that my girlfriend and I were among about 10% of the audience that laughed with the characters.  Only about 10% of the people enjoyed the film.  So I now feel smarter and more open-minded than 90% of the population.  You have to be openminded to like a movie like this, and perhaps that is the problem people are having with it.  You expect Sandler to be in your face with dick and fart jokes for 90 minutes, and you expect little character development, and a plot like that of every ""normal"" hollywood film.  This of course is not the case.  Films like this only come along once or twice a year.  Which sadly seems to prove that Americans have no imagination.  Everyone of course has different opinions of what is good,and what is not good.  Most people however didn't like this movie because it made them think while at the movie theatre.
If you like to use your brain, and have an openmind you should see this movie.  If you don't, save yourself the effort, you'll just be confused and disappointed, and then your constant complaints will get on the nerves of all the openminded people who understood why this is a great movie.",Punch-Drunk Love

Also, people, people, people... this flick should be judged as an allegory for the lone wolf or uncivilized man alone and left to his own devices. The Harmonium is his life/ life force/ love/ faith and so on. He's imprisoned through-out & is rescued despite his ineptitude... Anderson is a genius. The wardrobe selections alone give an indication of where the characters are going in any given scene. And with repeated viewings, if you consider the casting choices, you will understand that the movie would be an impossible mess without Sandler. I still can't believe that this is my conclusion, but I just can't picture any actor as Barry, except our boy. Although Emily Watson is as good as it gets, any normal, skilled 30-something actress would do the trick, I would say. The movie needs her, but is really not about her (character). For the Luke-warm fans, check it out one more time and appreciate the ""big picture""-type themes, not the odd dramatic tension.",Punch-Drunk Love

662,ruskrat,Favorable in love,8,27 October 2002,"I loved this movie, think it one of the best comedies of year 2002.  Its a serious comedy beautifully written with sound and direction above average.  Adam Sandler, whom I am only remotely familiar with from Saturday Night Live, plays a  character who learns that he can act and be admired without affecting indifference to or denial of various kinds of abuse from those close to him. A beautiful woman helps quietly to bring his truth out of him.  He is so used to abuse from his seven sisters (maybe an inside joke here; this used to be a slang reference to the major Eastern womens colleges) that he seeks and gets heavier abuse from a phone sex group which attempts to blackmail him. Believe me this is real, sort of from my own naive sexual history.  But this is art: life throws little tragedies at the Sandler character which are not his projections. I  had the gnawing feeling about a quarter of the way through that I had seen this character somewhere before.  Sacre bleu!  I think Sandler and Anderson have conspired to create a heterosexual PeeWee Herman!  He is dressed in a pretty (innocent) blue jacket and acts with dogged frenetic energy (eventually revealing stuffed anger) throughout the story.  Emily Watson knows that she wants to be with him and sticks sweetly with him through what  his previously limited universe unexpectedly throws at him.  Return of the zany sex comedy with a post-modern twist.",Punch-Drunk Love

This is Adam Sandler's most convincing and talented role as the bi-polar and dysfunctionally goofy and at times violent lead, and Emily Watson it seems was written for the part and she has her own unique character that sheds new light on her impressive acting talent.  What can i say about Phillip Seymour Hoffman that couldn't be positive he is without a doubt ""the greatest American ever!"".  It should win best picture not only because it was one of P.T.A's finest films but because it has no equal who could go against the quirky romantic-comedy?  The annoyingly over-cliched Road to Perdition or the wonderfully acted and directed but badly written Eight Mile?",Punch-Drunk Love
664,ruthgreene,Awful,1,15 February 2003,"I did not enjoy this film.  I found the use of so many directorial tricks to be extremely irritating - the light, the sound, the sudden noises, the strange camera angles.  That, combined with the irritating personalities of the two ""heros"" set my teeth on edge.  If I hadn't been in the middle of a row, I would have walked out (something I have never done before).",Punch-Drunk Love
665,easyj85,Is it Sandler or Anderson's Picture?,9,1 December 2002,"`Punch Drunk Love' is by far Paul Thomas Anderson's most surreal and artistically driven picture yet.  Anderson combines the real life story of Californian David Philips and his earning of millions of free frequent flyer miles with a very fresh and distinct love story.  Anderson's writing is still his strongest point, but where previous works `Boogie Nights' and `Magnolia' were driven by a strong ensemble cast, `Punch Drunk Love' focuses specifically on one character.  Adam Sandler's performance as Barry stands out as the surprise of not only the film (which far surpasses Anderson's writing and directing) but also as the surprise hit of the year as well. Sandler is wonderful in the role of Barry, a character who has wonderful plans and ideas forming inside, but is always silenced by the people around him who have been ruling his life since Day One.  In Barry, we see Sandler's familiar boyish-shy image, but as the movie goes on, Barry transforms into a stronger person who is able to express himself with ease.  One can see Sandler puts so much into every action, expression, and emotion that is a part of Barry.  Of course, Anderson has proven in the past that he can make a star out of anyone (as seen with Mark Wahlberg in `Boogie Nights'), which might lead us to believe that there is much more left for Sandler if he continues to play his cards right.  Everyone grows up sometime, and I believe Sandler just has.",Punch-Drunk Love

667,andymcnamee,a wonderful film,9,30 January 2008,"Paul Thomas Anderson has proved himself a true master of cinema in recent years and this is no exception. Magnolia and Boogie Nights rightfully propelled him to stardom and in this he turns the whole perception people would generally (having seen his other films) have of him on its head. Where Magnolia, and to a certain extent Boogie Nights, were vast landscapes with hundreds of characters all vying for the audiences affection and interest Punch Drunk Love focuses on the life of just one. Adam Sandler, and it has been said before, excels in nearly every way in his portrayal of lonely businessman Barry Egan. His performance is subtle, fascinating and interesting on nearly every level and proves his versatility as an actor even if he does often choose poor projects for himself. Emily Watson, as his love interest, also gives a career best performance as another lonely soul desperate for someone to love. Together they make a remarkable pair that easily carry the weight of the movie and their story is easily enough to absorb and interest viewers.In terms of the film itself I doubt you could find another PTA that is so interesting visually and technically. The film is shot in a dulled down realistic style that would not be out of place in reality TV. The use of colour also strikes as we see Barry in his remarkably blue suit as opposed to Emily Watsons striking red costumes. PTA's bravery in shooting this way with tricksy cinematography showing the story from strange angle is what marks him out as a true genius of his generation. He will never break rules but he certainly knows how to bend them to create a visual style all his own and yet keep well within the boundaries that could well and truly make the film inaccessible and distant to his audience. Though the film is a little slow and plodding for some (especially in this hyped up 'action' age of the blockbuster) it is never boring. As said in an earlier comment, knowing what you're in for helps a lot on appreciating this film. But if you want a visual treat with a great, and ultimately, very romantic story then this film will surely have you hooked.",Punch-Drunk Love

Anderson does a stunning job with the camera, i don't think there's anyone working today who captures LA as a real place so well (Ridley Scott and Michael Mann are damn good as well)the temptation is always to try and make it some noir hellhole when the reality is far more dull. The sequence where he first meets the Emily Watson character is a master class in combining dialogue, camera movement and dynamic mis-en-scene to create a sense of Barry's perspective. throughout this feels like actual people in actual places with actual lives, and thats not a quality i take for granted.Not to w~~k on about it but this really caught off guard. I expected a huge disspointment, but this is a sweet, profound bit of cinema. The entire cast shine in roles they seem made for, Sandler and Watson especially. This is one of very few love films where you don't feel bad for wanting a happy ending, as for once it makes sense.",Punch-Drunk Love
670,Swordfishtrombones,"""Punch-Drunk Love"" is a weird and wonderful film",10,14 November 2002,"Some very, very mild spoilers.Paul Thomas Anderson (of Boogie Nights, Sydney, and Magnolia) has created yet another textbook example of out-of-this-world cinematography and music, excellent use of sound, symbolism, story, and acting, wrapping them in a single, neat package.The plot revolves around a traumatized bipolar businessman named Barry Egan (Adam Sandler). All of his life his seven sisters have taunted him and called him ""gay boy."" After calling up a troublemaking phone sex hot line, he goes on a romantic journey with a woman named Lena (Emily Watson). Now with the phone sex hot line, the people are stalking him after getting his information and trying to get $700 from him.And did I mention he collects Healthy Choice pudding?While the plot is not particularly complex, it is still a fine story with even better acting. Adam Sandler is excellent, and this sure is a turning point in his career. Adam Sandler: you are forgiven for producing the putrid Master of Disguise this summer. Emily Watson is fine here, as usual. She might even get a nod. The supporting actors: no complaints here.The directing, well, there are VERY few people who could outdo Anderson these days when it comes to directing, and this is no exception. Symbolism, mind-twisters, a bizarre blend of comedy and drama, a few creepy parts, and some parts are pure genius. Hats off to Paul Thomas Anderson.The cinematography is brilliant. The movie has a significant use of color. Some stacked items of the same thing are different colors, colors are used to show emotions, and there are the shots that move while nothing else does. Blue and white is especially used. I'd also like to commend the editing: expertly done.The sound is used in the same quality of the cinematography. The beginning is shot with no background noise, and the moments that would generally be pretty background-centric with noises are completly quite. The sound is to match the world of Barry's.And all in all, ""Punch-Drunk Love"" is an amazing movie from a great director. One of the year's best.10/10.",Punch-Drunk Love

673,ezekiiel,An `art house Adam Sandler film',9,3 March 2003,"P.T. Anderson refers to this film as an `art house Adam Sandler film' which is a modest synopsis that doesn't quite give the film justice. The plotline is almost conventional romantic comedy fare but it is P. T. Anderson's direction that makes the film stand so strongly. The basic boy meets girl scenario is offset with the quirky, unconventional characters and by moments of pure randomness; such as a dramatic, but seemly irrelevant, car crash, ignored by both the characters and the narrative. A sub-plot involving a sex phone agency sets up one of the films finest moments in which the silhouetted profiles of the main protagonist and antagonist confront each other in a beautifully lit scene, `I have a love in my life. It makes me stronger than anything you can imagine' declares Sandler's character. The characters are finely observed and full of idiosyncrasies, and as in Anderson's previous films, the casting is perfect, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman, again provide the director with superbly hilarious performances, as does Sandler, who's humour and acting style is perfectly in tune with the neurotic, sadomasochistic elements of his character. The themes of coincidence and irony, explored in `Magnolia', again feature.

I watched it today thinking it was a very well considered comedy and I found something totally awful. I felt like an stranger all the time; even though some people say that is the main achievement of the movie, that is, to feel like the character, I instead think it was totally absurd: the plot, the characters, nothing made sense...We are not given insight in the main character; we don't get to know if he's mad or what. Suddenly, other characters appear and we know nothing about them.In the end, a romance inside a conflict which doesn't make sense at all. When I watch films by Lynch, for giving the best example or a weird director, I don't really understand them, but I do enjoy the ride.

I saw the trailer for it not too long ago while seeing One Hour Photo. I was instantly intrigued. I wasn't really sure what the movie was going to be about, or what to expect, but I really wanted to see it. I'm glad I did. The movie has a very unique feel to it. From the moment you see Barry you feel instantly sorry for him. Adam Sandler did a superb job in a departure from his previous work. All the elements worked well together, from the acting to the sound (or lack thereof) to the visual style of the cinematography. The movie is very odd, but very unique. I was very satisfied with it and I do not think that anything was ""missing."" The movie just felt right and I left the theatre very glad that I had seen it. I urge everyone to go see it, but I urge you to go with an open mind. If you do, I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.

What we get here is a work that is totally fresh, combining comedic and romantic elements with something dark and disturbing.Paul Thomas Anderson manages to de-construct Adam Sandler's screen persona, stripping away his juvenile characteristics and exposing the anger and shyness that sits right below the surface. Sandler gives a head-turning performance that really captures the frustration, shyness, loneliness, anger and sweetness of the Barry Egan character.Add beautiful cinematography, a punchy percussive score, a nod to past romances both American and French, and a blue suit and we've been blessed with an intoxicating and original mix known as Punch-Drunk Love.Already established as one of the premier directors today, Paul Thomas Anderson proves that masterpieces can be a 3 hour opus, or an 89 minute poem.",Punch-Drunk Love

When I first caught wind of this melding of genius (Anderson) with idiocy (Sandler), I surely thought P.T.'d lost his noggin'!  (Both ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" were my favorite films of their respective years.) Something surely was amiss -- P.T.'s seemingly commercial pandering was a black day, indeed, for independent-minded filmmakers!  My misgivings were nominally erased after ""Punch-Drunk's"" acclaimed appearance at Cannes.  I waited in anticipation....  And what anticipation!  And, a little over 90 minutes after the lights went down, I left the theater floating!!!  Floating from a natural high, the likes of which I haven't experienced in the cinema in a very, very long time!  Dare I say that what will more than likely be my favorite film of the year actually stars the seemingly-moronic Adam Sandler?!  WOW, is what I have to say about ""Punch-Drunk Love""!  From acting (pitch-perfect), to cinematography (mesmerizing), to production design (vivid), to editing (razor-sharp), to music (extraordinary), to sound editing (aural ecstacy), the film is simply masterful!  ""Punch-Drunk"" is pure cinematic artistry!  (Am I using too many exclamation points?  In my opinion, there's not enough of 'em!)  And Sandler?  Utterly believable and heartbreaking.  Emily Watson?  Incandescent.  There's much more to laud about this film, but I'll let you, the filmgoer, be your own judge.  For myself, I plan on getting ""Punch-Drunked"" a few more times....

680,phnutz,Completely unlike anything else you're likely to see.,10,20 October 2002,"Firstly, I thought the film was brilliant. So gripping it's almost hard to watch, Barry Egan sucks you in, and his life seems a pretty gut wrenching experience. If there is anyone who could resist the amazing acting in this film, I would be taking their pulse.The movie feels somewhat neutral to me after having watched it, but that's not for lack of any affects it had on me, but more like the sum of those effects. The movie is every bit as troubled as Barry Egan is, but is spotted with light-hearted moments too.There is scene where the two main characters discuss each others faces which nearly stole my breath with laughter, and that was the part that really brought understanding to their connection, I thought. It's a scene from a teen movie disassembled and reassembled by the insane. It works beautifully.On the other hand, it really is hard to predict when Barry will snap. There is one scene where he punches a wall, and I swear I was wringing my hands as he whimpered from the pain every bit as much as I imagine I would.It's romantic, and it's funny. Sometimes it's even both at the same time, but people label it a ""romantic comedy"" and I think that will ultimately upset some people expecting to see ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" This movie is something different than probably anything you have seen, and maybe anything you'll ever see again.With that said, a few things about previous comments.One guy said he was disappointed with PDL in comparison to his other movies. I feel the opposite. Magnolia was my previous favorite movie until tonight. Now, Punch Drunk Love. The reason is simple... it's the polar opposite of Magnolia - the complexity of nine plots spread out over a three hour period was, while gripping in itself, tedious in the replays. It was in my opinion the only flaw in that film.PDL follows one person, and although not as complex or full of dialog as Magnolia or Boogie Nights, it explodes with a constant energy that outdoes them both. Even in the moments when the characters are not talking, they are saying what people say when they don't say anything... and it's amazing to me that those moments can even translate to film at all.As for the unanswered questions, that seems to be a theme. PTA often leaves the shot on someone's face while you wonder what the hell he is looking at. Sometimes he never even shows you. Sometimes the answer is there, but you have to be very observant. Though I would not be surprised if some of the quirks of PDL were just added to throw us a curve.Someone said the movie is being reviewed on it's credits. The biggest name in the credits is Adam Sandler, and his previous work was nothing to rave about. Another said it was incoherant, that person must not have payed much attention. A better word might be implausible, but that's not much of a crime in the movie business.Another person said there is no plausible connection to the lovers in the movie. I'll disprove it: Lena said she had heard a story about Barry smashing a sliding door with a hammer. Later they have a conversation where they find some common ground in destruction. That could be the connection, but Lena isn't give the same attention as Barry, and thus we don't know. I'm not surprised to get that from PTA.And the last person I'll respond to said that Adam Sandler still can't act, and that for that reason PTA kept the camera off Sandler, shooting him from a distance. I could probably list scenes where the camera was on him at short range, and he was ACTING... not saying a word, but the look on his face was so genuine... so genuine that a couple of times it almost didn't even look like Adam Sandler at all. To say he did a lousy job acting is to say you weren't paying attention, or are so fond of criticism that you are never pleased by anything.BOTTOM LINE: If you want to see a movie that is completely different from most movies, see this one. I understand the critics are praising it, and it won awards, and for once the praise is deserved.",Punch-Drunk Love

This was a film far different then most Adam Sandler fans had seen before, adding Paul Thomas Anderson's filmmaking touch to it. There was a great mix of obscurity and symbolism throughout the film that truly made me feel like it was unreal, but I kept being brought back by the human qualities that Sandler portrayed throughout the film, showing love, anger, and loneliness.I definitely recommend the movie to those people who don't mind a bit of thought in their movie-watching experience. It really is a great film, I just have a feeling that people were expecting another Adam Sandler movie. This is definitely Sandler's best movie. I am just glad that both he and P.T. Anderson had the guts to shift their careers in different paths and make this movie. They definitely created something beautiful.
Watch it for what it is, an artistic romantic-comedy. It really is a great movie.",Punch-Drunk Love
685,ktobin33,I would punch a drunk person I love this movie so much,9,10 November 2008,"Getting off to a strong start with Sydney, Boogie Nights, and Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love is Paul Thomas Anderson's challenge of improvement vs. stagnation in his film career. And he succeeds greatly, taking the simplest love story and turning it into a visually-stunning movie that has marked both Anderson's and Adam Sandler's careers. Anderson even received the award for Best Director at the 2002 Cannes festival. Through the senstive and psychotic portrayal of Barry Egan by Sandler, the story is given a very honest overlook of the perils of finding love and holding on to it. However, despite beautiful cinematography and acting tour de forces, Punch-Drunk Love was a box office flop, only generating $17mil of the $25mil budget.Having just written and directed some of the most influetial work of the decade, PT Anderson transitioned from the complexity of life in Magnolia to the simplicity in P-DL. It's understandable that this film did not make back what it spent, as awkward love stories are not the top priority for American movie-goers. I like to think of this movie as a warm-up for Anderson's masterpiece, There Will Be Blood, but that's difficult to say, as there is so much original style and substance in this film. And if not Anderson's sake, watch it just to see how talented Adam Sandler is in a dramatic role, putting his days of ""nudie magazine day"" (from Billy madison) behind him.",Punch-Drunk Love

If there is a movie this year that will go down in cinema history, I think this is it. I think this will be remembered as one of the most refreshing and candid love stories ever told. And as for Paul Thomas Anderson, with each movie he increasingly fills the void that Kieslowski and Kubrick left. This movie was able to move me on such a fundamental level through its use of color,light, and sound that the acting, although good, was almost incidental. There is no over-acting in this movie.  I am slowly beginning to believe that PTA is the premiere film-maker of our generation.  He could make, and has made, a film about absolutely nothing and make it riveting.",Punch-Drunk Love

The film was excellent in many respects, despite that it seemed to start out very slowly and some might think was slow throughout. Some might find a few scenes hard to tolerate because they are many things going on at one time and distracting. It's clear thought that Anderson wanted everything to be seen and heard in this film. The plot is solid despite what many people may think; it gives a feeling of true to life-ness. Adam Sandler's performance is excellent (possible Golden Globe nomination).

689,darrylzero-1,A disappointment of gigantic proportions,1,5 November 2002,"Paul Thomas Anderson, director of cult favorites `Boogie Nights' and `Magnolia,' officially made his bid to enter the cinematic mainstream last week with his newest offering, `Punch-Drunk Love,' a slapstick-heavy romantic comedy starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson. While Watson's best role was in the brilliant-but-scarcely heard-of `Cradle Will Rock,' Sandler came onto the scene as a Saturday Night Live performer and has starred in a series of comedy vehicles designed to make money and further his stature as a superstar.  Few, if any, of Sandler's previous films could be confused with brilliantly-conceived works of cinematic art. Many people were surprised and put-off that Sandler and Anderson would elect to work with one another, given the vast differences in the types of films each is generally associated with.  Anderson's three-hour-plus `Magnolia,' which starred a pre-`Hannibal' Julianne Moore as a suicidal trophy wife and earned Tom Cruise an Oscar nomination for best SUPPORTING actor, showed that he's willing to play with audience expectations.but casting `The Waterboy' as the lead in a movie that's intended to be taken relatively seriously? Not surprisingly, there have been whispers of Academy Award nominations for Sandler. That said, `Punch-Drunk Love' is something of a mess.  Many of the events in the film just seem to happen with no real reason behind them.  Things like that are fine in a film like `Magnolia,' where Anderson established early on the theme of randomness and coincidence, but in `Punch-Drunk,' audiences are left simply to wonder why someone pulls up to Adam Sandler's door in the first scene, leaves a working harpsichord on the street and speeds away. The harpsichord recurs throughout the film, and is a conversationpiece, but that is its sole value.  Never does it actually play into the plot, other than the fact that character actor Luis Guzman and Emily Watson frequently correct Sandler that it is not, in fact, a piano. Sandler and Watson, both acclaimed by critics and film festival audiences for their performances in the film, turn in solid but ho-hum portrayals of characters in the throes of romantic love and, at times, insanity. Sandler is at his best when his character is stammering in front of the beautiful girl, and at his Live-From-New York worst when, for reasons that pass understanding, he destroys everything in sight at the mention of a childhood incident where his sisters called him `gay boy' and he threw a hammer through the sliding-glass door.  Twice is this incident mentioned, and twice does Sandler fly off the hammer, scream and flail about like the star of `Happy Gilmore.' The premise of the film is that Barry (Adam Sandler) has issues.  By the description he gives his brother-in-law the dentist, Barry seems to be suffering from serious anxiety attacks  characterized by acts of random violence and overconsumption.  To make a link between Anderson's film and Michael Moore's recent documentary `Bowling For Columbine' would actually give more strength to Barry's character-in `Columbine,' shock-rocker Marilyn Manson alleges that there is a cycle in America of `fear and consumption,' where people are terrified by violent TV and the evening news, and then immediately thereafter shown advertisments that show a happier life and delude us into believing there's an escape from real life through capitalism.  In Barry's instance, a man who has never flown before and has no immediate intent to do so again buys thousands of pudding cups because Healthy Choice is running a promotion where customers can turn in UPC symbols from their products in exchange for frequent flier miles. Coupling his anxiety attacks with the Manson theory on consumption, this might make the film a powerful commentary on American life.  Standing alone, it's merely a happy coincidence in a film full of them. Barry, in addition to falling in love with Lena (Watson), gets himself into trouble with a desert-dwelling thug played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and his cronies after giving his credit card information and social security number to a girl on a phone sex line.  Rather than using this information to commit identity fraud, as the situation would suggest, the girl calls Barry back begging for a loan.  When he turns off the credit card, Hoffman and his thugs take action.  The rest of the movie deteriorates into a long, dull chase scene with Barry inexplicably not calling the police, while either being on a date or running from villains. Clearly Sandler's best film, `Punch-Drunk Love' is still clumsy and slow-moving.  Anderson, in trying to establish himself as an `art' director, uses strange color-bar dissolves that skip across the screen and break up the action.  One might imagine that this is a device employed to hide major cuts made in a longer film (by a director prone to long films), to make it shorter and more palatable to an Adam Sandler audience. The length, though, might have saved the film from its greatest fault: the ending is abrupt and forced-it seemed random and the movie could have used an extra half hour to tie up loose ends.  Instead of building to a crechendo, the movie plods along its uneven path and then suddenly ends.",Punch-Drunk Love

691,samiamjam,Great Movie even if Sandler wasn't,9,10 November 2002,"Having seen my share of paltry romantic comedies and witnessing Adam Sandler's less than diverse acting career, I would have to say that Punch-Drunk Love is refreshing for a year devoid of intellectual movies. If you think Star Wars or Red Dragon were at all redeeming for this year, go away. You do not count. Punch-Drunk Love may not have been the curtain that revealed some unseen talent of Sandler. I have to concur with some of the people who said he plays the same character who talks childishly and breaks things. This movie deserves credit on its own accord, not Sandler's.Punch Drunk Love draws up on everything that made a classic 1960's love story, but also directs itself towards the unexpected and unusual. The technique of using all those colors at interims is not new or artsy. Its been done before in older movies. The sounds used in the background simulated Barry's mood and intensity. After the movie was over, someone immediately said, ""that sucked."" And if he was looking for an Adam Sandler movie, it did. But if he had said that it sucked for any other reason, he just didn't appreciate the movie and might have been too stupid to get all the little nuances and technical brilliance in it. If you don't know what I am talking about, then you didn't get it either, see it again, your eight bucks is worth it even if you still don't like it. And if you saw this movie and said it wasn't unique, just try to recount all the movies you have seen where a harpsichord was dropped violently onto the sidewalk in the first five minutes. Or a man who bought that much pudding. You might have the knowledge and stubbornness to find a menagerie of movies that fit that bill, and if you do, I applaud, but also I tell you this: You have no life and don't appreciate the good stuff. And this was a fantastic movie, but you just didn't get it.",Punch-Drunk Love

There have been mixed reviews and it is very apparent that those who did not enjoy Punch Drunk were those who really didn't understand it.  P.T. Anderson shows an exaggerated world that we can all relate to.  Elements of frustration that one consistently finds through life, yet within all the madness, despair, depression- there is a beam of light in life that is love.  Punch Drunk Love shows not only the existence of love but promotes its value as well.  Adam Sandler does a phenomenal job, with equally fantastic performances by Emily Watson, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and the always impressive Phillip Seymour Hoffman who's brief role in the film is certainly a memorable one.",Punch-Drunk Love
700,Hansolds52,Sophomoric Just because you can think of things to do with film doesn't mean you should.,2,28 June 2003,"To me this was a weak take off on the movie Bliss.  Using irritating sound mixes, visually disrupting film angles and acute lighting is not a proof of your cinematic manhood.  The tension of the film is generated but without guidance or reason.  In the movie Bliss this was artfully done to produce a ""impressionistic"" movie.  You felt the tension and the discomfort but in the end there was a reason for the painful journey.  Not so in ""Punch Drunk Love"".  Sandler was the only redeeming note in the whole movie.  And that was because he didn't play Adam Sandler.  Hackneyed tricks like pin spotting the lead couple holding hands was embarassing at best.  Do you blame the director or the script?  Again as usual probably both.   If you want to see the job done right see Bliss.  It is not comfortable and when I first saw it I nearly turned it off but I stuck it out and was rewarded in the end.

There are lots of brilliant moments in it, according to using mise-en-scene to emerge the unique tone of this film.It may seems strange but these moments reminded me great french comedian Tati( almost Im sure french dictation is different) I think this film shows that Anderson find his little tiny corner which is not so far from the main stream but its somehow personal and deep.Adam sandler is totally different and impressive in here. Emily Watson is always especially to me, I think I cant be a good reviewer in her case.

705,nodebug,"Excellent cinematography, nice direction, ok story.",7,17 March 2003,"This film is always going to disappoint most people because they will go into the cinema looking for a certain type of film and not get what they expected.For example:1.You look at the poster (Sandler holding Watson up in his arms against a gorgeous background) and see the name and expect a normal, guy meets girl love story. 2.You notice Sandler is in it and expect a stupid kiddy comedy with a love story latched onThis film is both and neither, not going too deep into it, the film is a very simple love story, with some very quirky characters, some very outrageous over the top moments (including car crashes and violence) and a overplayed and outlandish soundtrack that most of the time actually works with the film when not drowning out what you want to watch on screen.Though very enjoyable, this film just doesn't have enough of one thing. It has lots of pieces of some great ideas a (possible) hidden message (which I am still debating with friends) and some lovely cinematography and direction (which are the stand out features).Sandler, the only brother of 7 intentionally annoying sisters, makes a phone call to a sex line (presumably just for some company) and ends up being taken by the people that run it and forced to give them money. Meanwhile he meets Watson and falls in love but the aforementioned sex line company are still bothering him therefore getting in the way of love. Thats basically the story with some extras bolted on. I enjoyed it thoroughly becuase of the wacky characters and direction though it may not be to everyones tastes.Not another great PT film but a nice one nonetheless.You could do alot worse this year.

708,unprintable,Anderson leaves me stunned yet again,10,23 August 2003,"**** out of **** First off, I loved this movie. Ive seen Anderson's other films (besides his first, Hard Eight, of which I'm having a hard time getting a hold), and both Magnolia and Boogie Nights left a lasting impression for me. I was a little surprised when I first saw a trailer for Punch-Drunk Love that Anderson had chosen to work with comedic sophomore Adam Sandler. But, Anderson seems to have picked his lead well here, for Sandler works well here as emotionally-battered Barry Egan. Who knew he had the depth of character to portray such a layered character as Barry, but again, it works here. As for Emily Watson, she works wonderfully here as always as the heart-mender Lena Leonard. And Anderson-regulars Philip Seymore Hoffman and Luis Guzman also turn in strong supporting roles. Now, for the movie itself: this could be perhaps Anderson's best movie yet (though the other two I've seen were both amazing, especially Magnolia). He directs with the same long-shot style that was characteristic of his other movies, and it is once again very nicely done. The movie is full of seemingly random events, though in actuality they give symbolic meaning to the movie. The harmonium that is dropped on the street in front of Barry's office is representative of his heart, of which he is afraid to confront at first, but picks it up after meeting Lena for the first time. He finds it beat up, but eventually fixes it as his relationship with Lena progresses.Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) this movie stays under two hours in length, compared to Anderson's other two almost-epic-length features, but either way, you will find longing for the movie to continue long after the credits have stopped rolling.",Punch-Drunk Love

710,ngste1,Directing. Writing. Acting. This film shines all round,9,7 January 2011,"After falling in love with PT Anderson's previous films Boogie Nights and Magnolia I gave Punch Drunk Love a go. And although I despise Adam Sadler's comic movies, I had heard great things about his serious acting in this film. There is no doubt that PT Anderson is a great artist, and this film underlines that fact. It's eclectic in style with Anderson never willing to succumb to traditional close-ups for too long, or to traditional editing techniques. The film is kept fresh and creative throughout, with a nod to classic Hollywood love stories in some of its themes and music. Anderson focuses on the complex character of Barry who is charming in his shyness, funny in his nervousness and mild stupidity, and often scary in his anger outbursts. All of the scenes are played out with such realism, and all of the acting is superb. To top it all off the film is so hilarious in its own darkly comic way. There are moments when one feels they can either laugh or be very serious indeed. Before I forget I must mention the music that drives many of the scenes. It's percussive, and abstract, and helps dramatise the inner workings of Barry's mind. There are captivating moments like the long scene where Barry calls a sex line, and moments filled with great suspense. Everything is pulled off so expertly. Interesting, we don't really get a close-up of Barry until well into the film, but Anderson has kept our attention throughout this time, and consequently it feels foreign when he gets there. Credit to Robert Elswit for the brilliant cinematography, an Anderson regular.A brilliant piece of art all round that leaves the viewer feeling uplifted.

713,march-on-electric-children,a delightfully unconventional romantic film.,10,3 July 2003,"Personally, I hate romantic comedies. I hate them for two primaryreasons: 1. Usually, the two characters really aren't thatcompatible, and so instead they focus on risque, juvenile, orcutesy humor.  and 2. They are never convincing in showing howtwo characters fall in love over the course of 90-120 minutes.Punch Drunk Love is romantic, but not too cheesy, and funny, butnot too slapstick, and my favorite movie. When watching it, onedoesn't obtain that usual feeling of ""they love each other to makethe movie work."" Instead, on screen, the development betweenBarry (Adam Sandler) and Lena (Emily Watson) is apparant andconvincing, and the dialogue and situations display to theaudience why Barry and Lena actually go very well together. Lenais compassionate and quirky and offers companionship andsolace for the confused but good-hearted Barry.The cinematography, and particularly the use of light and dark tocreate tone, are remarkable in this film. Also, sometimes betweenscenes, there are bizarre swirls of color accompanied by pleasantmusic. I suppose that the movie just kind of does what it wants,but it all fits together very nicely.My favorite aspect of Punch Drunk Love, besides the cinematography, is the underlying plot about the Healthy Choicepudding.All in all, I definitely recommend this film.

The other payoff was Barry slowing confessing all of his lies to Lena.  I kinda wanted more payoffs with the sisters and the phone-sex operator but I didn't get it and I was a little disappointed with that.All in all, I thought that it was a good movie and I don't regret renting it.  I probably would not buy it because it would have to be a damn good chick flick for me to buy it.",Punch-Drunk Love

The movie is a romantic comedy done in a brilliant and original way, like nothing I have seen before. Simply and concisely put, the story-line unfolds a peculiar love story set under peculiar circumstances. Nothing seems forced; the movie flows, smoothly evolving due to a sound script, director, and cast.

In the beginning I found the main character to be boring and mundane but saw that the character had the potential to revolt against those that held him back and kept him down. This did not occur, whilst there was one moment that he actually took control I felt that Punch Drunk Love came to a dead end.  There was some strong scripting in a couple of stages of the show but the writers didn't appear to capatilize on this.  I'm not sure.  I don't like it.  I found it boring, whilst waiting for it to get better and it just didn't quite pull it off.  I don't think this is the best of Adam Sandler.

Adam Sandler is great, in the kind of way Jim Carrey was great in The Truman Show.  At times I even thought this may be one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I look forward to seeing it again.

Sandlers films are very hit and miss for me, I like as many as I dislike, and I guess I should admit to loving a bit of fluff.This was difficult to watch for me, mostly in a good way, I actually experienced the pain Sandlers character is living.He plays Nick, a loner, socially awkward and prone to bouts of aggression, mostly as a result of his frustrations related to his overbearing, bullying sisters, 7 of them, and being blackmailed by a sex line worker.
The way this is filmed and it's use of empty space, streets, roads, and discordant music serve to illustrate how bleak his life is and how much pain he is in.
It actually hurt to watch it, you just want something to take away Nicks pain, and thankful it does in the form of Emily Watson.

I have seen Boogie Nights and loved it, so I figured I could not go wrong with this.  I guess you just have to feel for the way PTA directs, I have not seen Magnolia either, but heard it was the same way.  If you have to chance to view this movie, see it on tv, but don't make the same mistake I made and buy it. It's already a $10.00 special at Wal-Mart.

738,John_Ryan_Sullivan,A Matter of Perspective,10,27 March 2004,"Outside of the internet I have encountered no one who is willing to proclaim their love and devotion to this film, and this confuses me.  In an interview I read with Kevin Smith he was quoted as saying something like, ""Paul Thomas Anderson would be a great filmmaker if he could just get over himself."" I like Kevin Smith, I enjoy his movies very much, but I would have thought someone who has received so many negative comments concerning idiosyncratic details of his films would, perhaps, be a bit more forgiving of another in his shoes.  Most of us are not in that position, but I have seen, firsthand, the quick and swift judgement that comes to Mr. Anderson's films. Why is this I wonder? If I had to guess I would say the biggest thing working against him and his films is the misconception that his is an ultra-serious director. I know Magnolia suffered for this reason. Criticism of that film focuses on his heavy-handedness and somewhat bizarre biblical references, yet I think anyone who has head his commentary on the DVD would be quick to admit that the symbols and references within the film are nothing other than the offspring of a playful and creative mind having a bit of fun in an otherwise morose tale. It would seem that his departure from this ""seriousness"" was not really what his critics wanted and now that they have it they can only hold it disgustedly at arms length, turning it over, hoping to find all of the flaws. So what about Punch Drunk Love? I think it was too much in the seemingly light-hearted direction that the detractors of Magnolia and cheerleaders of Boogie Nights wanted PT Anderson to travel in.  Again he has a story centered on a character who is small, beaten and broken. Yet this isn't a sad tale, it's a love story after all. As I see it, this is a story of a man who feels he has no control over his life, that the forces of the world are continually pushing him about no matter how hard he struggles against them; and yet because he perseveres, because he does not give up or give in, he's open and ready for an opportunity, for love, when it presents itself. My adive to all that have not yet seen Punch Drunk Love and those who have but thought it trite or stupid or just plain no good, watch this movie with an open mind and remember that this is a director that likes doing silly, goofy things in his films for no other reason than because he can and he likes to.",Punch-Drunk Love
739,enew311,This is a wonderful movie,10,14 July 2005,"This is a great movie (my opinion) and here's why...it shows two characters falling in love and acting stupid.

I think this is the kind of movie that is sorta just sitting there, waiting for the ""right"" people to see it and nod their heads and smile and say, yes, this is how it is. It's quiet and doesn't scream for people to pay attention to it; it's just there.

I have experience working with people across bipolar disorder, autism and asperger's. Shy people, depressed people, and those with intermittent explosive disorders.His character seemed to float from one to another in an unconvincing manner.Using a soundtrack of drumming on five gallon pails was particularly distracting.

Barry one day (after seeing a car accident)gets an harmonium. Then, he meets Lena Leonard (Emily Watson). Barry seems to be a normal guy, but he has been tortured by his 7 sisters since he was born, so, he doesn't know what love is. He has some emotional problems like punching windows, crying without reason and stuff like that. One night, feeling sad and lonely, Barry calls a sex phone number. The next day the girl from the sex phone number calls Barry and ask him for money. Barry denies and then, the movie starts.There's an excellent performance by Adam Sandler (the best of his carrier i think) and a beautiful Artwork by Jeremy Blake.

Emily Watson is great,Luis Guzmán has a very small character but he plays it well, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is hilarious!!! This is my favorite Paul Thomas Anderson movie. It's great!! I can't stop watching it!!

It is so bad I felt compelled to go online and write a review--something I have never done before. I guess the whole point of the movie was to show that Adam Sandler can play a serious role, which he can. But couldn't they also have added a plausible plot? His character has some kind of social phobia or disorder, but it is never made clear exactly what it is. Therefore, his thought process, motivations, and behavior never quite make sense. The part about the sex phone line is not reasonable or believable either. None of it makes much sense. Even the background noises and music are terribly annoying! It not only did not contribute anything to my knowledge or entertainment, but left me with a horrible feeling in my stomach. I think it was indigestion.",Punch-Drunk Love
748,mtdabrow,"an OK movie, better than most crap out there",7,5 February 2005,"This movie was somewhere between average-mediocre crap and excellent. After sifting though other reviews, not surprisingly, all I saw was 1's and 10's. Apparently its one of those movies you just gotta either love or hate, and if you fall somewhere in the middle, somewhere between 4 and 7, you're some sort of freak. Anyhow, without further ado, here is my freakish opinion.If I had known that Adam Sandler was staring in the movie ahead of time, I would have never gone to see it, but apparently inadvertly I have surprisingly learned that Adam Sandler can actually act in a serious role in a decent movie and has more talent than I thought. Unfortunately, after this film was made, Adam Sandler went right back to making his usual hit-and-miss crap for his usual fan base --- teenagers and slapstick-comedy fans. Hopefully, Spanglish will move away from that trend. IMHO, Adam Sandler is a complete waste of talent.Although I'm not a film major and know nothing about camera shots or angles, I absolutely loved the shots and how realistically the film looked, especially the warehouse shots and camera movements. Although what is up with the colors.The best aspect of the movie however is the character development. That was done superbly. Adam Sandler had portrayed the life of a semi-loser with a poor social life and an issue or two with random tantrums perfectly. Unfortunately the movie's weakness is its plot line.Although it might not be fair to judge this movie for the plausibility of its plot, considering that 1) it was meant to be surreal and 2) this is a film starring Adam Sandler that we're talking about here, the movie creepingly resembles reality in the cheap, bare-looking setting. Furthermore, as it appears that this movie is trying way too hard to resemble reality, it is only fair that I DO judge it's plot harshly.The plot doesn't have coherent direction and the movie could lose some of the subplots, which quite frankly are killing the movie. First off, what is up with the phone sex mobsters. Clearly this is not the most cost effective way to run a business and not the best way to keep overhead down. So these goons, 5 of them, somehow fly the country just to violently extort a mere $750. Mathmathectily, that's just $150 each, barely enough to cover the plane ticket. And who in their right mind would risk a violent crime felony charge for a hundred-bucks anyway. Hell, a hundred-dollar worth of five-fingered discounts doesn't amount to a felony in most states. Besides, wouldn't a normal person likely contact the police after someone tried to assault them and violently extorted money? It makes you wonder, a bunch of goons running around the country extorting petty amounts of money from random victims. If you could steal someone's identity though a phone sex business, wouldn't it instead just be easier to steal their money though credit-card fraud rather than making violent treats. The average credit-card fraud loss per victim is $500 easy, with virtually zero overhead.Secondly, what is up with the pudding cup collecting? First off, a corporation would likely not have made such a mistake. And if they did, wouldn't more people catch on and at some point the company would notice and retract their offer. More importantly, running a small business can't be an easy job and the warehouse did not appear to have many employees. From the looks of it, a small-business owner with like 3 employees is unlikely to have the spare time to meticulously stack pudding cups and sift though all grocery store offers and catch some obscure loophole. It makes you wonder, do the authors think about these things.Apart from the sloppy, poorly thought-out subplots, the plot overall is convincing enough to keep you from saying ""wtf."" The set-up blind date by his sisters by such two incompatible people, especially Sandler's character that lacks anything that resembles social graces, in real life would have a very low success rate, however not zero by a long shot. In this movie, the romance, although not likely, is plausible enough and the excellent acting helps in that department. Granted, Sandler's character is not a complete loser considering he owns a small business that didn't go belly up after a year and the woman seems a bit ""man hungry"" despite her successful career. Also, there is something in about him that drives *her* crazy for him which is plausible, since his character is certainly no babe magnet.Also, like a lot of realistic independent low-budget looking films, this movie tended to be slow and dragged on a bit. But overall, it was greatly produced and seemed to be well-edited.",Punch-Drunk Love
749,donkeymoo,beautiful but strange,9,9 February 2005,"I watched this movie fully expecting it to suck. I'm not completely against Adam Sandler, but really, most of his movies have very little critical credit. But his performance in this film is just exquisitely and painfully uncomfortable.But enough about the movie! I've watched it about 15 times in the last 4 months, and every time I watch it, it gets stranger and stranger. Who is this Lena (Emily Watson)? Do we really know anything about her? There one niggly scene which jars with me -- Sandler is in the supermarket, and we see a blurred red figure down the end of the aisle, seemingly keeping a furtive eye on him.AH! After I saw this, Lena became a stranger and stranger character, to the point where she became almost sinister. What is her obsession with Barry? what are her motivations around being friends with his sister (when it is clear that they have nothing in common)? And, I feel most importantly, WHY DOESN'T SHE HAVE NUMBER PLATES ON HER CAR? On the surface, this is indeed a poignant and cute love story, but i think there's something a bit strange going on that PT Anderson isn't telling us about.",Punch-Drunk Love
750,jwinstone1,Shame Sandler hasn't done any more films like this!,8,7 November 2013,"I know a lot of people have said this, but wow, I was completely blown away by Adam Sandler's performance! I literally have never been so surprised about an actor/actresses performance. I've never really hated Sandler partly due to the fact that as I was growing up he appeared in a lot of kids films that I saw although obviously as soon as I was old enough to care I got quite tired of his bare minimum performances in same old, same old ""comedy"" films. I remember reading a review a while ago about the film (can't remember who wrote the review) but the fact that they pretty much said he gave a career-saving performance immediately caught my attention. I also wanted to see this because it's the only PT Anderson film which I had not seen. Let me just sum up Sandler's performance in short so I can fit in the rest of the review...it really is brilliant, it's scary how well he plays someone so frightened and alone, he always shied away from those sort of roles and it's interesting how his performance actually at some points is quite similar to some of his not so good performances in the way he behaves, except he actually expresses genuine emotion, it's truly amazing (not so short I know). I also cannot emphasize enough that Sandler is not the only highlight of this film, though, Emily Watson is fantastic and she really gels well with Sandler, although I feel her character could have been developed a little more. The cinematography and in fact every artistic element of the film is wonderfully different, normally I cringe when I see lens flare and even the colour bars used in the film work well. Every artistic element of every single shot has clearly been well thought out in order to emulate Sandler's character's lonely, isolated life (for example the fact that the supermarket (which funnily enough is called ""Super Market"") is most of the time empty and all of the shelves are untouched which in my opinion represents his emotions and how they are left alone and untouched which is what causes him to have outbursts and is why he has been alone for most of his adult life. Sandler and Watson make the film perfect because they're not the sort of couple you would expect in a romantic film, normally the protagonist might be feeling down or lonely, but they are never anywhere near as bad as Barry (Sandler) and Lena (Watson). The entire film is just unexpected, I never thought Sandler could perform so well, I never thought a romantic film could have so much depth and honesty about it's main character and I never thought Philip Seymour Hoffman could make such an impact in such a short appearance. This film is evidence of PT Anderson's ability, not only because he can get a great performance out of Sandler, but also because he can make a story which goes against the typical code of a romantic film and take it to new levels of darkness without losing sight of the romance. He also manages to give it a happy ending without it coming across as cheesy or cliché. Whilst it's a shame that Adam Sandler did not really try to turn his career around and continue to do performances like this one, it sort of makes you appreciate this performance a little more.",Punch-Drunk Love
751,cook-alastair63,Punch-Drunk Love,9,6 January 2016,"Having already watched four of Paul Thomas Anderson's films (There Will Be Blood, The Master, Inherent Vice, and Boogie Nights), I foolishly began watching Punch Drunk Love thinking I knew what to expect. How rude of me to Paul Thomas Anderson's art. For one, I had assumed that if a movie were to be a Paul Thomas Anderson movie, it had to have a running length of at least two and a half hours (not that I have a problem with this). Secondly, I had presumed that the central characters in Mr. Anderson's films were all built upon selfish motives. In There Will Be Blood, for instance, Daniel Plainview is an oil tycoon who will stop at nothing to satisfy ""the competition"" within himself. In The Master, Joaquin Phoenix plays a war veteran who aimlessly travels around the country from group to group, searching for comfort, laughs, and drinks to hide his traumatic experiences from himself. In Boogie Nights, Dirk Diggler is consumed by fame—and, for lack of better words, his ""large assets,"" if you catch my drift—that lead to arrogance and drug use, which nearly destroy him. As for Inherent Vice, alas, I admit that I, among many others, do not understand this movie very well (Paul Thomas Anderson himself stated that he was ultimately confused by the plot and stressed his fans to view it for its art and mania instead). Nevertheless, I shall treat myself to a second viewing in good time.But I digress. My third assumption was that I had never thought Mr. Anderson could pull off a romantic comedy. And boy, was I mistaken. Not only is this film graced by wit and charm, it is also led by powerful directing from Mr. Anderson. Never had I thought that I would actually enjoy a performance by Adam Sandler, who instead of using his usual comic routine of shouting and profanity, instead turns to subtlety, producing a character who is gentle, kind, and admirable.Sandler plays Barry Egan, a neurotic loner who owns a small toiletry appliance business. Barry is verbally abused constantly by his seven sisters when in their presence, and deals with these frustrations with fits of rage. One day, a girl named Lena arrives at his shop asking him to hold on to his car keys. After destroying several windows following abuse at a party with his sisters, Barry chooses to confide in his brother-in-law, a dentist, that he wishes for therapy. Instead of helping Barry in his desperation, his brother-in-law informs his sisters of what Barry confided in him, including his crying episodes. One night Barry calls a phone-sex line and talks with a girl named Georgia, who attempts to extort money out of Barry after fooling him into giving his credit card information. When it seems that Barry is about to snap, Lena reenters and saves him from the madness of his personal life after he agrees to go on a date with her.Though the abuse Georgia puts Barry through is terrible, this is only the climax of Barry's discontentment. Barry has lived his life constantly under barrage of the demeaning force of his sisters. Up until his meeting with Lena, he does not encounter a single person, aside from his coworkers, that doesn't attempt to extort the little happiness he has left. Lena is a woman who goes beyond understanding his episodes of anger; she is completely indifferent to them. She is the only person to see Barry for who he is: a kind, funny, and sweet man, who will overcome his fear of traveling to go all the way to Hawaii to see her. She is the only person brave enough to explore Barry, take the time to have a polite conversation with him without degrading him every other sentence. She has plenty of opportunities to walk out where many others would have: for one, when Barry destroys the restaurant bathroom on their first date after she unknowingly unnerves him by bringing up the memory of his sisters' abuse. However, since she is able to see the true side of Barry through his pain, she sticks with him without a moment's hesitation.The standout commemorative work of this film, however, is Paul Thomas Anderson's direction. Always a fan of the tracking shot, Anderson does not shy away from it in this film. He follows Barry and Lena with the camera in the same way as we the audience follow them through their adventures together. He also minimally uses the close up and over the shoulder shots. Had this film had standard establishing shots followed by quick cuts of over the shoulder shots during character interactions, it would not have had the same engaging effect. Instead of merely spectating Barry and Lena, we feel as if we are just across the aisle at another table as we watch them in the restaurant on their first date; a third member of the group as they walk slowly down the hotel hallway and begin to hold hands. Accompanying the film are colorful interludes which artfully depict the switches between acts. It is masterful directing.Never have I been so surprised by a performance as Adam Sandler's, so engaged in the relationship of an innocent and quirky couple, so amazed by the personal life of a strange man in a blue suit by the name of Barry. Once again, Mr. Anderson, it has been a pleasure.",Punch-Drunk Love
752,jazza415,Unexpected...,7,21 April 2014,"Wow, that's the first word that comes to mind when I watch this movie. I sat there, as every minute passed, thinking to myself, when is the comedy going to kick in? If you are watching this movie expecting a comedic film you will not enjoy it for this reason. Once I reached the end of the film i realized i had paid no attention to the story line, or what was really happening. For some odd reason I watched a second time, not expecting a comedic film, just watching and observing the story. It is deep, intriguing, smart. Adam has shown us a side I never expected to see, and did so with talent.All in all, it is a great film, but not a film i would personally watch again.",Punch-Drunk Love
753,addictedtoanotherreality,Great film that requires your own interpretation,9,5 May 2005,"Punch Drunk Love makes you feel the emotion of it's main character. Adam plays Barry Eagan,the only brother with seven over dominating sisters. you see that he can't escape them emotionally, as they barrage him with phone calls at work, and tales from his past. hischaracter develops in the film when he meetsthe love that he missed and finds the determination within himself to overcome his fears.I think this film was awesome to the core. I only gave it a nine because it wasn't all that I expected, and I still can't make sense of the color scene, but it's awesome!",Punch-Drunk Love
754,ventingvegan,Gave me a headache,5,29 May 2006,"I don't know exactly what annoyed me about this film, but it was annoying. I literally am left with a headache. Maybe from having to look at a horrid blue suit for 90 minutes? Or having to listen to Adam Sandler's nasally monotone voice? (I actually liked him in ""The Wedding Singer"" where he employed the same tone, but it's getting old.) Sure, there were some amusing moments, interesting camera work, etc. but when I had to pause the DVD to check on some laundry, I was hardly anxious to get back to watching it. Tedious...I also watched Closer this weekend and highly recommend that for a more comprehensive ""twisted love story"" with similar dark tones.",Punch-Drunk Love
755,DistinctlyMe,Suspensfully Awful!,1,22 May 2005,"Have you ever watched a movie ... constantly thinking ""it *has* to get better?"" The ONLY reason we didn't hit the ""stop"" button on this one was because we were convinced that it had to get better ... it was leading up to something. When the credits hit, we were all left sitting there staring at the credits thinking ""huh!"" We actually waited until the end of the credits hoping that it was some kind of joke and that something really was going to happen.Honestly, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was excellent, the movie was put together well, but the story needed telling about as much as the last time I cut my toe nails.How this got a high rating, I'LL NEVER KNOW! It was worse than She Beast and THAT WAS ONE BAD MOVIE. Seriously! The ratings for this one make as much sense to me as the voting of the Academy and the voting of ice skating judges.If you decide to watch this one, poke yourself in the eyes first: at least you'll blink.If you liked it, there's medication for you.

757,jackvacton,comedy?,7,23 June 2005,"Where I have seen this movie advertised, in video stores, etc. I have only seen it categorized as a comedy. However, when talking with friends whom have seen the movie, they were just as perplexed as I am now (since I recently saw it) in what categorizes this movie as a comedy. Perhaps the definition is derived from the the original meaning by implying that the story has not have a tragic ending. Or perhaps at the time the movie was made there was no other way to treat a movie starring Adam Sandler.Restlessness aside, I enjoyed the movie and what it did to me. I enjoyed how uncomfortable I was while watching it. I felt the movie was made well, character development apparent, to the point setting, convincing story, and intriguing artistic enhancements. The flow of the stroy line kept me at bay however. I was rooting for the protagonist throughout the entire movie, yet was hoping for more of a resolution with his sisters. The understanding I got was based solely on the last conversation, which was clearly a turning point. i suppose i merely wished for more in that particular area.My rating was based high for a movie I would not wish to see again. It was a good trip while it lasted, and lasted on further after into the day. It was difficult for me to watch. However I am a glutton for punishment when it comes to dramas.",Punch-Drunk Love

The plot was stupid and slow, and Adam Sandler's character was idiotic and completely lacking in charisma. Sandler really needs to stick with the comedic roles that we all know and love him for. As for this writer/director, he should go into a new line of work.This movie was neither a comedy nor a romance, nor anything else that can be easily defined. There was a definite lack of character development, particularly with regard to Sandler's sisters, but also the main character himself. In case you couldn't tell, I disliked this movie greatly.",Punch-Drunk Love
763,grantdenise7,"Great performance from Adam Sandler, soundtrack is awesome.",8,19 December 2005,"Excellent film, and not the usual schmaltz from Sandler. He gives a great performance, but I still can't work out where he is coming from. Lots of anger from him as is normal in all his films, but in this movie it is slightly threatening. He is basically a warehouse owner/manager who is lonely and doesn't have a love life, but obviously this changes. Not your usual run of the mill love story, and all the better for it. Best thing for me was the soundtrack, and if nothing else the movie is worth this alone.If you enjoyed Jim Carey in Eternal Sunshine, then you will enjoy this. No matter how many films you have watched, you will not see the plot coming, it keeps you guessing all the way.",Punch-Drunk Love
764,flagg05,Some missing parts for me...but I still enjoyed it.,6,10 December 2006,"On a whim, I picked up Punch Drunk Love at Movie Galleryit was a free movie, and despite most of the things I've heard about it, I still wanted to give it a shot and at least see a movie I've been meaning to see for quite awhile. After pushing stop on my DVD player, I instantly realized what the movie did well, and where it fell short.The major flaw behind the movie, aside from the strangeness, (but lets face it, are our lives really so normal in the first place?) was that it simple tried to accomplish too many tasks and pull itself in too many different directionswithout ever fully completing one. Probably the only section of the story that actually finished itself was the pudding loophole, as things tended to CONCLUDE. The newly found love between Adam Sandler and Emily Watson was never fully developed to allow the viewers to fully connect with the characters and their own connection towards one another. Instead, we see many scenes of utter awkwardness between the two, and in the end, they're magically in love.However, on the flip side, Adam Sandler's character was very well developed and played out well, but I believe a run-of-the-mill American viewer isn't going to completely understand him or why he does the things that he does. With an extreme low self-confidence, he finds himself lashing against the world in all kinds of ways. The character himself is very deep and interesting, but due to the containing that the script called for, I don't think a lot of people will fully understand Sandler's character.Phillip Seymour Hoffman absolutely rocks as a ""villain"", and if his part could have made more of an impact on the complete story, there may have been a little more substance in the end of it all. He is gradually becoming one of the actors that are placed very highly on my list.In regards to the writing and directing of the film, Paul Thomas Anderson is of course the source of the ""oddness"" that may lead to the film disagreeing with viewers. He has a very unique style with pulling the camera far back and surveying the scene, even if its just a slummy area of LA. The writing was not on par at all with Magnolia, but I'm not going to hold it against him. If he just kept writing movies like that, we'd get nowhere in the movie industry, so I guess it is cool to see him branching off like this. Interesting shots are taken, and the use of the actors in front of a bright background is used to an extreme, which was cool, but also hindered the film as the repletion started to get annoying.If the movie had pulled away and focused on one area, rather than spreading itself too thin, I believe it could have been better.
