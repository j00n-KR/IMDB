0,MartinHafer,Ruined by marketing idiots,5,2 July 2009,"This film about two lovable idiots who go to spend the weekend with Bernie. Sadly, Bernie is dead when they arrive. But, not wanting to pass up a great weekend in a wonderful beach-front house, they decide to pretend that Bernie is still alive. Instead of telling the guests that Bernie is asleep or indisposed, however, they decide to actually bring this corpse everywhere with them--for the entire weekend.This is a rare film because I have never seen another film with this exact problem. It's not just the film itself that I have a problem with but the marketing idiots that sold this movie. You see, when I went to see a different movie, they showed a preview for WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S and most of the people in the theater laughed and loved the trailer. It was jam-packed with funny bits--many, many funny bits. In fact, and here's the big problem, when I actually saw WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S, I found that there were no surprises----none! That's because almost every single gag from the film was in the preview! Part of it is because the movie was a one-joke film and it needed more, but the biggest part was the selection of clips in the preview.",Weekend at Bernie's
1,SnoopyStyle,"one joke movie, stupid but cute enough to watch once",6,24 September 2013,"Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are best friends working under Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). They discover a serious discrepancy in payouts to life insurance by the company. They don't realize that it's Bernie who's been committing the fraud.

When Larry and Richard find Bernie dead in his beach house, they decide to keep the illusion of him being alive to keep the party going.It's a one joke movie, and it's not that funny of a joke. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman have some fun carrying Bernie around. They work well together. They've got good chemistry.

2,claudio_carvalho,Silly and Funny,7,17 April 2019,"In New York, Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) are ambitious employees of an insurance company. While implementing a computer system, they find a two-million dollar embezzlement and immediately report to their boss, the bon-vivant Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). In return, Larry invites them to spend the weekend at his beach house in Hamptons Island. However, Bernie is the responsible for the theft and he asks his partner, the mobster Vito (Louis Giambalvo), to kill Larry and Richard. Vito assigns the hit man Paulie (Don Calfa) to kill Bernie instead since he is too greedy and is causing many troubles with the mafia and his girlfriend. Paulie kills Bernie with an overdose of heroin and when Larry and Richard arrive, they find their boss dead. But soon there is a party at his house and the guests do not notice that Bernie is dead. Among the guests, Jonathan sees his crush, the intern Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), and flirts with her. What will Larry and Jonathan do next?""Weekend at Bernie's"" is a silly but funny black comedy. The joke is always the same, the film is stupid but most of the situations are gross and hilarious and in the end the viewer will certainly laugh a lot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Morto Muito Louco"" (""A Very Crazy Dead"")",Weekend at Bernie's
3,lee_eisenberg,feel the Bern,10,21 May 2016,"This absurd comedy elicits no shortage of laughs. ""Weekend at Bernie's"" is one of those movies where a mishap snowballs. I laughed to think of how the main characters were feeling as they had to make it look as if their dead boss was alive. The whole thing is low humor, but anyone with a sense of humor is bound to enjoy it. At the very least, guys are bound to enjoy seeing so many women in bikinis (Gwen is one of the ultimate hotties).Ted Kotcheff also directed ""The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz"", ""North Dallas Forty"", ""First Blood"" and the original ""Fun with Dick and Jane"". Co-star Don Calfa also co-starred in ""Foul Play"" and ""Return of the Living Dead"".",Weekend at Bernie's
4,BA_Harrison,Lifeless.,2,26 June 2018,"Andrew McCarthy possesses a smug, s**t-eating grin to rival that of fellow brat-packer Tom Cruise, but with a fraction of Cruise's charisma he has to be one of the most irritating actors of his generation. Quite how he became a star is a mystery to me. Still, in the farcical Weekend at Bernie's, he's in good company: co-star Jonathan Silverman is equally as obnoxious.Together, the pair play co-workers Larry and Richard, who, hoping to climb the corporate ladder, go to their boss, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), with evidence of company embezzlement. Seemingly pleased with their discovery, Lomax invites the lads to his luxury house in the Hamptons for the weekend. What the duo don't realise is that it is Lomax who has been stealing the money and that he has arranged for Larry and Richard to be bumped off by his mob associates. However, in a turn of events, it is Lomax who is killed for fooling around with his Mafia partner's girlfriend. When Larry and Richard arrive at Bernie's house, they find their host dead, but must pretend that he is alive so that they can still enjoy their weekend.With the two lads clowning around with Bernie's body, the scene is set for lots of very dark humour, but the woeful script fails to do the premise justice, while the young leads are painfully unfunny, their slapstick routines utterly predictable and poorly executed. Director Ted Kotcheff wrings far too few laughs from Robert Klane's one-note script to make the film anything but an embarrassment for all involved.",Weekend at Bernie's

6,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,What a pathetic attempt,1,17 April 2004,"It amazes me that there are so many people who like this movie; or wait, maybe ""amazes"" is a wrong word to use here... ""concerns"", or maybe ""terrifies"" is more like it. The movie is solely based on the one joke of a guy being dead, and no one noticing it. This might have worked if it was considerably shorter(like, an hour and a half shorter, if not more) but it just isn't funny when it's put into a two hour movie. Normally I love black humor, but this was just way too far out. The whole joke depends on everyone in the vicinity, who sees the body being total retards, and that just seems like a stretch. The plot is far-fetched and hardly funny(at all). The characters are walking, talking cliches. The actors all lack any charisma or on-screen chemistry(with each other). The humor relies solely on a lot of mix-ups, one more ridiculous and unrealistic than the other; yes, arguably, a lot of comedies use unrealistic scenes or plot items, however, the movie lacks any sort of realism at all, it might as well have taken place in outer space, that wouldn't have made it any more far-fetched. The whole ""dead guy who everyone thinks is alive"" is just not that funny, especially because when he was alive, he seemed to be walking and talking constantly, yet no one suspects anything when he suddenly stops reacting. The movie has so many ridiculous and unfunny scenes that it's hard to keep count of them. Some of the humor is also slap-stick, and while I've never liked slap-stick, I can honestly say that it has been done so much better, so many times. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless I seriously loathe them, and want them to experience the horror of this pile of crap. Avoid at all costs, and I DO mean ALL COSTS. 1/10",Weekend at Bernie's
7,neil-476,One of the great comic performances,7,25 March 2012,"Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) discover a scam and report it to their boss Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them to his beach house for the weekend as a reward. Bernie actually plans to have them killed (he is the one who is doing the scamming), but when he dies at the start of the weekend, chancer Larry persuades worrier Richard that, with a little bit of effort, the whole weekend remains to be enjoyed - no-one has to know Bernie died just yet, right? Especially if he gets seen out and about...This daft comedy is lifted out of the ordinary by one thing, and that is Terry Kiser's extraordinary performance as Bernie. Not while he's alive, mind you, but after he's dead. Kiser's remarkably physical performance as Bernie's corpse is extremely funny and raises this film to the level of minor classic.",Weekend at Bernie's
8,morrison-dylan-fan,Bernie's Weekend.,6,1 October 2015,"Talking to a family friend about movies he was after.he mentioned to me a title that he had been meaning to pick up for his dad for ages.With having seen the film mentioned when a poll was held on IMDbs Classic Film board for the best movies of 1989,I decided that it was time to finally spend a weekend with Bernie.The plot:Spotting irregularities in payments that their insurance company are receiving, Larry Wilson & Richard Parker go to talk to company CEO Bernie Lomax. Praising them for spotting cash being stolen from the business,Lomax offers Wilson & Parker to join him at his seaside beach house for the weekend. Accepting the offer,the guys get set for a well-deserved break.Unknown to Wilson and Parker,Lomax is actually the person behind the irregularities.Wanting to keep things quiet,Lomax talks to gangsters Vito and Marty,and asks them to kill Wilson and Parker at his beach house.Unhappy with how Lomax has treated them,the gangsters decide to kill Lomax.Arriving on the island with dreams of sun,sea and girls,Parker & Wilson begin to think that they will have to change their plans,when they enter the beach house and discover Lomax's dead body.View on the film:Placing the boys in the middle of ""The City"" director Ted Kotcheff (who also has a very funny cameo) and cinematographer François Protat gives Lomax house and office a decadent appearance,with the endless sun and shining mirrors blinding Parker & Wilson from seeing any danger be reflected.Along with packing the screen with gorgeous bikini-clad girls,Kotcheff gives the title a sharp black Comedy edge,thanks to the wild slap-stick being threaded to Wilson and Parker's desperate attempt to make Lomax look ""revived.""Opening with the guys being down on their luck,the first half of the screenplay by Robert Klane hilariously show Wilson and Parker's desire to move up the corporate ladder,by constantly going back and forth over if they should report their ""great"" bosses death,or if they should continuing to pretend he is alive.As the guys take increasingly drastic measures to cover Lomax's murder,Klane struggles to keep the fresh atmosphere of the slap-stick drying up,as Parker and Wilson start to go round in circles that become increasingly worn out.Whilst he does look like a mannequin,the scenes of Bernie being thrown out of the building and falling flat on his face were actually done by a real stuntman-who broke some ribs during filming! Joined by a sassy Catherine Mary Stewart as Gwen Saunders, Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman give great performances as Wilson & Parker,with McCarthy laying charismatic laid-back charms on Wilson,which is counted by the biting his fingernails fear that Silverman grips Parker in,as they head off for a murderous weekend with Bernie.",Weekend at Bernie's
9,FlashCallahan,What your doing is illegal.......,7,2 April 2012,"Richard and Larry are two best friends who discover that someone has been embezzling money from their company.When they inform their boss, Bernie Lomax, he is so apparently pleased that he invites then to his beach house for a weekend of fun and leisure and women.But once they arrive, they discover him dead! Richard wants to do the right thing and inform the authorities as quickly as possible, but Larry is determined to still try and have a weekend of fun and leisure and women.....First things first, if you don't like the sound of two men walking around with a dead body, making it do admittedly stupid, but very funny things, steer well clear.But if you can swallow your pride, and admit to the fact that you really want to see this, or have seen it just for the fact, that whenever the titular character falls, or gets 'hurt' in any way, it's a funny movie from start to finish.A farce on many levels, the film works because it's just so bright and sparky.The two leads are great, Silverman playing the straight guy, McCarthey playing the party animal, but both characters are very likable.It's just one of those movies that puts a big grin on your face, forgettable the minute its over, but still a lot of fun.",Weekend at Bernie's
10,Aaron1375,A rather funny tale about two buddies and a corpse.,7,14 February 2010,"This film had its moments and at times was very humorous. The story has to losers who are looking for a break and think they have found it when they uncover some expenses that are being siphoned out of the company they work for. Well it turns out their boss who they report this to is the one doing the removal of the money. He acts like their buddy and that they did a great job and proceeds to invite them to his beach house where he intends to have them both killed. However, the one who ends up whacked is the boss himself. Well the guys find there boss in the dead state and the goofball one proceeds to play like the boss is still alive just to enjoy the beach house a bit more. However, they soon discover that the boss intended to kill them and they think that as long as they keep the boss around and make it out that he is alive the would be assassin will not try to kill them. Many jokes in this film involve just battering the hell out of the two guys' former boss' corpse. However, the movie takes a bit to get to this point and at times the premise is stretched a bit to thin, but for the most part the film stays funny. The cast is rather good in this one as Andrew McCarthy is rather good in his role as the more slacker friend. Johnathon Silverman is his usual self too. No one else of real note stars in this movie, however the guy who did Bernie was rather good when he was alive and dead.",Weekend at Bernie's

12,StevePulaski,Alive and kickin',8,16 May 2011,"Weekend at Bernie's is easily one of the most underrated and truly funny comedies of the eighties. It has a sort of cult level to it, but nothing respectable like some eighties films. It's unsung, much like License to Drive. It managed to spawn a sequel four years later and sort of has its own dark side equipped with certain levels of humor. It's hard to explain.Before I get into the plot and the positives, let's talk about one small thing; some points in this film are hard to believe. Some scenes where the boys desperately struggle to pass Bernie off as alive is definitely fake. It is hard to work with a plot where you have to pretend a character is alert and active very smoothly. McCarthy and Silverman do only a fair job as they try to work with the script they were handed trying to make a dead guy seem living.Sometimes, it is just not believably that guy is alive. When Larry is ""playing"" Monopoly with the corpse, maybe at a distance Bernie can seem alive and well. But when his wife goes to have sex with him, it is hard to believe Bernie has an active sex life when he is dead. Certain points were not executed as well as they could've been. But it was good and not a total letdown.The plot: Two time insurance clerks named Richard and Larry (McCarthy and Silverman) find a flaw in the companies' receipts suggesting someone could be stealing money from the company. They report the problem to their boss Bernie Lomax (Kiser) in hopes to acquire a certain reward for their findings.Bernie says he wants them to come down to his Hampton Island beach house to spend the weekend to celebrate what they did for the company. Richard and Larry don't know that Bernie plans to have them both killed. Bernie, ironically, is then killed by one of his buddies named Paulie who then shoved heroin in his pocket to make it look like an accidental overdose. Upon Richard and Larry's arrival they find the dead Bernie and contemplate what to do with him.They decide on pretending he is alive so they do not need to spend a weekend answering questions they don't know at the police station. Incredibly self indulgent, but understandable to a degree. Not like they killed him.The comedy is slapstick, but people do not understand that slapstick can be done well. All you need is a serious situation, done right. Nobody wants to watch a comedy where the characters are having a good time. Like Grown Ups. If you watch a comedy where the characters are trying to have be serious, but nothing but comical things come in their path, then that is funny. Black Sheep and Death at a Funeral are prime examples of good slapstick movies.What also helps any slapstick formula are two people that work well together. Most likely, you'd get a serious guy and a silly guy. Andrew McCarthy and Johnathan Silverman are a good duo and sort of remind me of a pre-Chris Farley and David Spade relationship. Not as funny, but a little reminiscent.Weekend at Bernie's is by no means an awful film. There are certainly worse comedies that don't even make me smile and are more like watching a bad home movie. The eighties ruled in the comedy genre. While Weekend at Bernie's is still waiting to have a blowup in popularity, it is sort of full of life in its own right.Starring: Andrew McCarthy, Johnathan Silverman, and Terry Kiser. Directed by: Ted Kotcheff.",Weekend at Bernie's
13,disdressed12,fairly amusing black comedy which could have been better(which is where the sequel comes in),7,29 April 2007,"this movie is not too bad.it's a black comedy that is entertaining and certainly amusing.without giving it away,Bernie is a rich guy,who ends up dead,yet still manages to be the life of the party,literally,thanks to two best friends(Andrew McCarthy,Jonathon Silverman)who also work or rather--worked for Bernie.i won't sat any more about the plot.if you want to know more,you'll have to watch the movie to find out.being a black comedy,the movie is entertaining and quite amusing at times,though not drop dead funny.(sorry, i couldn't resist)this is of course the point in this type of movie,to be wryly amusing and even ironic at times.i liked it quite a bit,though it could have been better,given the premise.there is so much rich material they could have mined,in my opinion.and while it doesn't quite reach its potential,it's still worth watching.Both McCarthy and Silverman are good in the roles as sort of an ""Odd Couple"" type.Richard(Silverman)is more strait laced and conservative,while Larry(McCarthy)is a slacker interested in having fun,more than anything else.Catherine Mary Stewart is very good in her supporting role.i only wish she had a larger role.but it is very clear she is very talented.however it is Terry Kiser as Bernie,who steals the show.who knew a dead guy could be so amusing.all in all,a good,not great movie.it spawned a sequel,which is much better,in my opinion.if you like this movie,i highly recommend part 2.as for this movie,I'd give it a 7/10.",Weekend at Bernie's

15,theowinthrop,Klane and Kotcheff succeed where Hitchcock failed,10,21 June 2006,"There is really nothing funny about a dead man and his corpse. Yet occasionally corpses happen to be the subject of humor. There was the amusing film (based on a Robert Louis Stevenson novel) THE WRONG BOX, which was elegantly done, and was quite good. There was Alfred Hitchcock's attempt at a totally funny black comedy regarding hiding a dead body in New England, called THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY. And best of all was this 1989 comedy about a body that takes on a ""life"" of it's own.Hitchcock's fans insist THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY is one of his greatest films. It isn't. It demonstrates that Hitchcock's sense of humor was best used as a seasoning. A good example: in FRENZY the trouble the Scotland Yard Inspector had with his wife's ""continental"" cooking attempts. Every now and then the action leaves the scenes involving the suspect and the real killer and the victims, and we watch the poor Inspector discussing the case with his wife (who makes some good suggestions) while they eat all sorts of concoctions that the poor man loathes. It is not a bad running joke - but it is not the main theme of the film. The main theme of THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY was that a number of people in a New England town all have had problems with Harry. The joke is how each of these people tries to hide the corpse, alone or with each other. They are helped by the stupidity of the local sheriff.The problem is that Hitch's originality and inventiveness began to fade in the film. After all, how many times can you show people hiding a body and make it funny? And this was the actual plot - not a sideline to the plot.In THE WRONG BOX there were other strands (the antics of Michael Caine, Peter Cook, Dudley Moore, Peter Sellers, Tony Hancock, Ralph Richardson, and John Mills in different directions - frequently at cross purposes). The fact the body gets mislaid, when it is at the center of the plot of Cook and Moore, concerning a tontine. The corresponding scheme of Mills trying to get rid of his rival Richardson for the tontine. In short the body is an element, but not the center of the joke.WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S changed this. The corpse is the center and movement of the plot, but screenplay writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotchoff realized what THE WRONG BOX showed, and what Hitch missed. The key of the use of a dead body as a matter of humor is not hiding the body, but producing it. In THE WRONG BOX it is hidden by various people, for different reasons, but several (Cook and Moore) plan to produce it at a given moment - and can't. In short the body has movement despite being a body. Hitch just kept having the body of Harry dug up and moved to another grave several times - movement it's true, but repetitive movement at best. One exception, but a meaningless one - when Harry's body is put into the bathtub in Shirley MacLaine's house. Why should it be in the tub? Hitch never really gave a reasonable reason for that.In WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S Klane and Kotchoff solved this by creating the necessity of making people believe the dead Bernie is not dead.Terry Kaiser is Bernie Lomax, the head of a large company that Andrew McCarthy (as Larry Waters) and Jonathan Silverman (as Richard Parker) work for as accountants. They discover a huge discrepancy in the books, and make the mistake of trusting this information to Bernie. They don't realize he and his partner have been looting the company. Bernie invites them to his home in the Hamptons for the weekend (where he secretly plans to bump them off). What he does not realize is that his partner has decided to bump him off, so Don Calfa (as Pacho, the hit-man) shoots Bernie, and leaves his corpse in the house. He thinks that the two visitors or someone else will report the finding of the dead body. When Waters and Parker show up, they discover the dead man, and they are aware of his plot against them. Should they call the police? They decide they would be suspected. So the best thing is to make it appear that Bernie is still alive, and that he is having an active, fun-filled weekend with the two fellows. With plenty of people seeing and ""speaking"" to Bernie during the weekend, they will make sure that when they leave, nobody will suspect them. Of course, as time passes, Pacho can't understand the failure of anyone to discover the murder. He keeps returning and ""killing"" the living Bernie again and again and again. But Bernie keeps surviving to be seen limboing, swimming, and even water-skiing (my favorite part of the film).From a comedy about a dead body it becomes a comedy about frustration for the gunman, and of inventiveness by the two young heroes. It also is a smörgåsbord of prat falls, blows to the head, and unnatural natural accidents for actor Terry Kaiser. His performance as the all too lively when dead Bernie is one of the funniest silent comic jobs in recent movies, as his semi-smile and sunglasses make him seem crocked more than dead to everyone dancing on the beach front at his house. It is certainly more interesting than that of the actor who was ""Harry"" in Hitch's film - who just had to lay on the ground or get carried somewhere. Again, a clever grasp of the possibilities of the situation in reverse, in a well written and directed film like BERNIE'S, beats out the unimaginative use of the corpse as a simple prop even if the director is (otherwise) a master of cinema elsewhere.",Weekend at Bernie's
16,lesleyharris30,"Stupid, Simple Fun,",7,12 May 2019,"Weekend at Bernie's is a good movie with a reasonably well written plot, and a talented comedic cast. It is certainly nothing spectacular, but it is a consistently fun, enjoyable movie that plays with its ridiculous concept in a manner that leads to hilarious, absurd slapstick comedy.The film does suffer due to only really having one major joke for the whole thing, that Bernie is dead but no one apart from the two leads know. While still funny, it gets very stale as the joke is that people are talking to him and making no realization that he is not responding, it can get tiring when it's a whole hour and a half long.Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy save the film with their chemistry that is palpable throughout, even when the plot starts to wear off, their energy and clear sense that they are having fun makes us.Nothing perfect, but consistently enjoyable. While Weekend at Bernie's is forgettable and not very stimulating, it is a good laugh.

17,CuriosityKilledShawn,Who knew that being dead could be so much fun?,6,25 May 2014,"I remember seeing TV spots for this movie in Florida in 1989 and thinking that it made for a great concept. When I eventually rented the VHS tape a few months later it really appealed to my dark sense of humor and I ended up watching it a zillion times. In the 25 years since its release it has become very dated. It's not dated BADLY, but it has aged more than other films of the period.Corporate slackers Richard and Larry (Ted Mosby prototype Jonathan Silverman and 80s person Andrew McCarthy) discover a $4,000,000 fraud hidden away in the cooked books. Their attempt to impress their boss Bernie Lomax (a lovably smug Terry Kiser) with their find leads to an invitation to his Hampton Island home for a summer weekend of babes, booze, and boats. The duo don't realize that they've stumbled on Bernie's embezzlement scam and that he intends to have them quietly killed by the Mob (the organized crime connections are never fully detailed or understood). Mob Boss Vito instead arranges for Bernie to be killed, thus washing his hands of him.Upon arriving at Bernie's lavish home Richard and Larry discover that he ain't quite breathing and most definitely has ceased living. For a variety of reasons they plot to create the illusion that Bernie is still alive, which proves to be easier done than said as his vacuous, drunken neighbors are more interested in drinking his champagne and mooching parties from him than actually being friends.Despite the dark subject matter Weekend at Bernie's plays it safe for the most part, never pushing past its PG-13 boundaries. The physicality of Kiser's performance is impressive as well as funny. You really do believe he is dead and he's brilliant at keeping a straight face (or a smirking one as he dies during a brief moment of pleasure) while being tossed and thrown around. You wouldn't think that playing a dead body would be hard but Kiser's comic timing and skill really pay off.The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears.What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family-friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Skip the sequel. Enjoy this movie for what it is, though it could have been better if it were a few shades darker. And lookout for a hilarious cameo from the director as Richard's dad/butler.",Weekend at Bernie's
18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,21 August 2012,"Weekend at Bernie'sRealistically, if you are going to be walking around with a corpse, it's best to do so in a cold climate.However, the friends gallivanting around with a carcass in this comedy aren't interested in retarding its putrefaction.After co-workers and friends, Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) uncover insurance fraud at their investment firm, they take their findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser), who invites them up to his Hamptons home to discuss the matter.But when Bernie's assassinated, the dimwits decide to act as if nothing has happened, pretending that their host is still alive.Through elaborate means, the duo manage to deter the would-be killer, if only for a short time.While its ludicrous plot deteriorates faster than Bernie's flesh, this outlandish comedy, however, does find ingenious ways of keeping the titular character animated.Furthermore, a stiff at the beach makes an ideal paddleboard.

19,tomgillespie2002,100 minutes of pure pain,2,3 December 2013,"Time has the knack of breathing fresh new life into a former piece of crap. Nostalgia sets in with the fashions and the music of its era, and familiar faces re-appear after we have seen their careers gradually collapse. Unfortunately for Ted Kotcheff's Weekend at Bernie's, it is the same cringe-inducing, one-joke farce it was 24 years ago. There was a real chance for some dark comedy here, given that the set up isn't a bad idea if you have the correct writers behind it. However, Norman Mailer did not write Weekend at Bernie's, Robert Klane did, and he was responsible for such classics as National Lampoon's European Vacation (1985), Folks! (1992), and, most unforgivably, Weekend at Bernie's II (1993).Larry (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard (Jonathan Silverman) are two young, eager lower-level employees at a New York insurance firm. When Richard discovers that an employee has stolen 2 million dollars from the company, he and Larry think they're on their way to a promotion and take the findings to their boss, Bernie (Terry Kiser). As a reward, Bernie invites them to stay at his island beach-house, but secretly, Bernie is behind the theft and has hired a mob hit-man to take them both out. However, Bernie himself is assassinated for sleeping with the mob boss' wife, and with party-seeking friends quickly turning up at the beach- house, Larry and Richard must maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive and well if they want to party.It seems strange that their has never been (to my mind) a decent comedy involving a dead body. Perhaps the presence of a cadaver is too macabre a subject to raise any laughs, or, as with Weekend at Bernie's, there's not much you can do with it apart from move its limbs and head in an attempt to squeeze out some laughs. And that pretty much sums up this film, raising the question of how moronic can these people be to not realise Bernie is dead? Perhaps it's because, inexplicably, rigor mortis fails to set in at any point and his bowels do not drop. This may even be forgiven if we had anyone to root for, but, as hard as McCarthy and Silverman try, their characters are nothing more than incompetent goofballs chasing that ever-so-80's dream of climbing the corporate ladder. 100 minutes of pure pain.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Weekend at Bernie's

The way that Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman interact with a Kiser is great work as well. Those three together are a joy to watch.

21,insomniac_rod,Entertaining nostalgia.,8,27 July 2006,"Oh come on! You can't help but like this movie. I remember loving this movie as a kid but watching it recently made me recognize it's merit. ""Weekend At Bernie's"" established a new way of making comedy. Mixing black humor with solo performances and a cheesy premise are the winning elements of the movie.This isn't by any means one of the greatest comedies ever made, but still it's a fun, mindless, entertaining flick that deserves to be watched with a bowl of pop corns and soda! This is what I call a perfect manner of entertainment for a Saturday morning. Seriously, this movie is hilarious and you can't help but love Bernie even that he's dead for most of the movie. The performances of Kiser, Mc Carthy, and Silverman are great. The three make a hilarious on-screen team that would do great at the MTV Movie Awards.Watch this movie that somehow has generated a cult of fans in order to witness how a mindless plot can actually get all of your attention and take many laughs out from you.Most of the situations are very cheesy but somehow are creative and you can't help but laugh.",Weekend at Bernie's

Richard Parker (Silverman) and Larry Wilson (McCarthy) are 2 New York guys who discover false policies written for the insurance company they work for. They inform their boss, Bernie Lomax (Kiser) and he rewards them by inviting them to his island beach house for Labor Day weekend. It turns out Bernie is the one stealing from the company and decides to have them killed. Bernie is killed instead before Richard and Larry arrive. They soon discover that Bernie is dead, but try making him look alive where he's still the life of the party. Stewart (The Last Starfighter) plays Gwen, Richard's co-worker & love interest, Calfa (Return of the Living Dead) plays Paulie, a mob thug sent to kill Bernie and the film's director, Ted Kotcheff (First Blood) also makes an appearance as Richard's father.

The End.There's actually a lot of complicated plot tissue involving an insurance scam and some Mafia hit men, but talk about rigor mortis: forty minutes of valuable screen time is spent setting up the only joke of the film, with the balance of the story devoted to little else except a series of lame hide-the-corpse jokes. The film might have been attractively lame-brained if it weren't so generically bland, or had even a hint of comic timing. But as it stands (so to speak), not even a touch of necrophilia between the late Bernie and his clueless nymphomaniac girlfriend is enough to bring it (or him) to life.",Weekend at Bernie's

25,gcd70,"Not riotous, just ridiculous",2,6 September 2007,"Ted Kotcheff, one of the most inconsistent directors ever known to the cinema, presents his audience here with a very silly film. Two corporate yuppies are invited to their boss's island mansion to supposedly work with him on a two million dollar mistake made by the business. The plot however, isn't worth a second mention, and neither is the comedy.After waiting for half the film before we are presented with any humour at all, ""Weekend at Bernie's"" fast becomes a one gag film. Dreary effort at a potentially riotous, if ridiculous and stupid, romp. Starred Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman.Friday, April 17, 1992 - Video",Weekend at Bernie's
26,PredragReviews,"""Why don't we just pretend he didn't die? Just for a bit!""",8,17 July 2016,"The production design and flat photography are what date this film so much. Although Ted Kotcheff had Wake in Fright and First Blood on his resume by this point he brings very little visual flair to the film and it looks very TV-ish. The poor score by Andy Summers never seems to work with any scene (I have a feeling that his friend Stewart Copeland would have done a better job) and some of the soundtrack choices grate on the ears. What amazes me the most is that about 90% of the dialogue is (bad) ADR. I assume that the sound guy forgot to switch on the mic or something. I can accept it when it comes to dubbing over several F-bombs to keep the movie family- friendly but you'll be surprised at how often the words simply do not match the lips.Despite however morbid it sounds, it's far from it and is actually a light-hearted comedy. This is one of those movies I love watching and can watch this constantly when I want to. There's just something about the movie that I love and often has a cheering up effect on me. Andrew McCarthy, Jonathon Silverman, and Terry Kiser work very well in their performances. It's all handled quite ridiculously, but come on, writer Robert Klane and director Ted Kotcheff are not aiming for Shakespeare here. What the film sets out to do is make people laugh, and I cannot deny it that. Most of the laughs are due to the amazing performance by Kiser, who looks and appears dead the whole way through. Whether flying off the back of boats, over railings, and down ramps or walking with Larry and Richard around town happily, Kiser actually convinces us that he is out of the picture. McCarthy and Silverman are also very funny with their contrasting personalities, Richard the voice of reason and Larry the horn-dog that has more bad ideas than good ones. So don't expect a comedy classic here, but I would be hard-pressed to find someone who appreciates dumb comedy when it is done well that doesn't at least smile throughout the film.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Weekend at Bernie's
27,eric262003,Not As Funny When I Think About It,5,23 August 2021,"I'm trying to be a prude in any way possible, mainly because when I was young, I actually enjoyed watching ""Weekend at Bernie's"" mainly out of a guilty pleasure or as a relief of the stress I undertook in my first year in high school. But now as a much older adult, I have a different opinion about this movie that contradicts my perspectives as I look deeper into this movie that sadly changes the feeling I had in my youth. The biggest weakness about ""Weekend at Bernie's"" is that it's way too one-note in its jokes and seems to carry throughout the whole movie that it quickly becomes quite monotonous. And though the atmosphere is light and spontaneous, the movie actually leads to many dark paths that are at times uncomfortable and traumatizing in its content.The story centres around two lower prolific employess of an insurance company named Larry Wilson (Andrew McCarthy) and Richard Parker (Jonathan Silverman) who were going through some research through the systems when they've stumbled upon what appears to be someone robbing money from the company and decided to take upon themselves and report it to their boss Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser). To show his appreciation in their discovery, he invites them to his beach resort in the Hamptons for a weekend of enjoyment and partying while going through their findings. But then we later discover that the fraud is really him and fearing that these two idiots might catch on, he hires the mob to take them out. But the mob decide to take Bernie out instead for becoming to greedy and careless with his money, plus he's getting a little too touchy with his girlfriend.When Larry and Richard show up, they discover Bernie's dead, they at first decide to call the police, but have a change of mind and have the weekend party that was promised to them and then deal with the situation later. Just then the party people show up and take advantage of his house, riding his boat, having sex on his couch, drinking his booze and eating his food. While all this is happening, no one notices or even bothers to care that the life of the party is actually dead. This eventually leads to the fact that Larry and Richard catch on that the plot to have them killed was prerecorded and that they could still be targets to the mob hit, so they keep carrying and hiding Lomax's corpse around acting like he's still alive just to fool them just to save themselves. All of this feels wrong and unsettling on all sorts of levels.Though it tries hard to disguise itself as a comedy with quirky one-liners and humourous situations, it's way too dark and just never seems to have much going for it in terms of some moral lesson. Perhaps it's just me thinking way too hard over a silly comedy and that I need to get a grip. Movies involving corpses are conventionally not funny and regardless of the macabre nature of Lomax's character carrying him around like that and making a comedy surrounding around him is just diabolical.But why is it that dead bodies used as props never work in movies albeit comedy? Is it because it's offensive and disrespectful and that it's morally reprehensible? That's a narrow analogy but to go much deeper most comedies are at the most offensive and morally unglued. Why this movie in particular doesn't work is that 98% of the characters in this movie are stupid. From the heroes, to the villains, to the party guests, everyone seems to be completely shallow and ignorant.What they should have done to make this movie more better, not that it would have made a difference is to just use his corpse to a limited effect and only feature him in a more subtle fashion. But in ""Weekend at Bernie's"", these idiots at the party are going so far as to have him wrap his arm around them, making business discussion arond him like he'll answer them back and in a scene that made me sick to my stomach, the mobster's girlfriend actually makes out with Bernie. How could anyone be so shallow?I guess growing old is not very pleasurable, not just by looks but by ways of thinking and observing thing you didn't when you were young. Even though ""Weekend at Bernie's"" might take me back to time that I'll never get back, it did open the door to new things I discovered now that I never seen before. And believe it's not that great. I'll leave it there.",Weekend at Bernie's
28,KUAlum26,Bernie's the life(and death)of the party!!,6,14 June 2008,"The plot of this ersatz classic is almost universally understood,so I won't bother with recapping this little adventure epic where two working stiffs(JOnathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy)find themselves propping up their stiff boss(Terry Kiser,who may've had the best performance of the film!)after he's found dead in his swank beach front home. Instead,I'll say that this movie is clearly a ""guilty pleasure"" of mine. I saw this back in Summer 1989 when it was first released,and I enjoyed it profusely then. I was also seventeen then,so I've sometimes wondered if I'd care for this much now(I'm not sure,but it seems I'd seen this intermittently in the years since,but I don't recall sitting through this in at least a decade). My answer is:yes,but only in the sense that it's great,seemingly brain-dead(pun unintended)slapstick that can cleanse the palate,particularly after watching dark,disturbing material or if one is need of a pick-me-up.For some odd reason,the producers decided(And were able to get the stars to reunite)to make a sequel which was released in 1993. I have yet to feel much desire to catch it,since I felt,even nineteen years ago,that this wacky,breezy comedy had only one life left in it for real. Go to your local video store or CD/movie exchange place and there's a good chance you'll run across a REALLY cheap copy of this. Feel free to indulge your daffier,undignified self and buy it... if you dare!",Weekend at Bernie's
29,Sergiodave,Not as good as I remembered,6,18 August 2021,"A well known 80's comedy that was very popular in it's day but on later viewing has lost almost all of it's appeal. The trouble is that it's a one joke movie, that and my teenage humour was very different to now.",Weekend at Bernie's
30,Jeremy_Urquhart,I thoroughly dislike this movie,2,20 April 2020,"Oh boy.I acknowledge that not a lot of people read my ramblings at the moment, and maybe no one ever will read these. But if you are someone who's browsing through my reviews because you're bored, and you happen to have come across this review, and you like the ""classic"" late 80's comedy Weekend at Bernie's, then I apologise in advance because I'm about to say some harsh things about this movie. I just want to get one thing out of the way first though- if you like this movie, I'm not suggesting that you're opinion is wrong or that you're dumber than me or that you're even dumb at all. Comedy is so subjective that neither I nor anyone in the world really has a right to judge what comedy certain people may or may not find funny. That said, I believe I'm allowed to express what I think of movies that I'm not all that keen about, even if that goes against normal opinion, and the general consensus on Weekend at Bernie's seems to be that it's a stupid, immature, yet funny black comedy about two buffoons that somehow end up at their dead boss' holiday house, and need to, for their own safety, create the illusion that this boss is still alive.It's a silly plot and I don't really want to talk about it anymore- even people who enjoy this film don't enjoy it for the plot, which is shallow as hell and only there to justify a wave of repetitive and stale slapstick comedy set-pieces... in the second half of the film that is.Yes, it takes the titular Bernie over half an hour to die, and it's about forty minutes into the film before the two bumbling main characters realise that they have to pass off his corpse as a being that is still alive. Therefore, the first half of the film is almost completely devoid of humour- just look at the ""riotously funny"" scene in which a robber attempts to hold up Larry and Richard who are taking a stroll on a scorching summer's day, when the former tells the robber that it is ""too hot"" of a day to be robbed, and keeps on walking with his friend like nothing happened. This joke comes out of nowhere with no set up or anything, and adds absolutely nothing to the film. The movie's first act is littered with forgettable instances of humour like this, and it makes for an incredibly disappointing and even slow start to what is supposed to be a fun, over-the-top comedy.Unfortunately, once Bernie dies, it doesn't really get much better.If any film could truly be called a ""one-joke"" movie, then Weekend at Bernie's is it without a doubt. And in all honesty, that single joke isn't too great to begin with. Basically, the joke is that Bernie's dead, and how hilarious is it that nobody seems to notice this! Witness the party scene, where each guest comes up to the corpse of Bernie, puts their arm around him and says something that he can't respond to, and they're cool with it presumably because he was such a bland and unlikeable person during his life and they don't really care what he has to say anyway. I thought this could be a comment on how boring and lifeless wealthy people can often be, but I think reading into the film that way is giving it way too much credit.And then begins the terrible slapstick humour, where our two ""likeable"" ""protagonists"" drag Bernie's corpse around the island, treating him like some sort of puppet. They take him on a boat that he manages to fall out of, they push him round on a cart that he manages to fly out of, they put him in a wheelbarrow that he manages to fall out of, and the ""fun"" seemingly never ends. I felt this film, above all else, was kind of boring. Once I got over the novelty of a corpse in slapstick situations (which happened pretty quickly), I was sitting there just praying the film would end and put me out of my misery.And it did end- badly. The climactic fight against one very incompetent assassin contained such poorly executed physical gags a 5-year-old would struggle to laugh. And as the credits rolled, and that stupid 80s music played, I was at once thankful yet also somewhat angry- I felt as though I had just wasted a chunk of my life and really hadn't got much out of it. It wasn't even a ""so bad it's good"" type of movie for me; it was just kind of dull and repetitive, two things a comedy should avoid being at all costs.Maybe if the film had had some more likeable main characters, a less forced love interest, and more than one joke it could've been a decent film. One reviewer, I believe it was the late and great Mr. Ebert, said that perhaps the slapstick corpse shenanigans should have been a sub-plot of the movie rather than the main focus, and I agree with this statement whole-heartedly.I used to think that comedy was something that aged terribly, as what people find funny tends to change over time. Commonly made jokes made 50 years ago, for example, may not resonate with those living currently. Humour that was seen as raunchy a few decades ago may seem rather tame and even boring by today's standards. However, this was a belief I held only before I started checking out some of the so-called ""classic comedies,"" a few of which I enjoyed immensely; films like Some Like it Hot, It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, and Dr. Strangelove to name a few of my personal favourites. These are comedies that I believe to have aged surprisingly well, containing humour that has somehow transcended being only funny in the society in which they were made. Something about these movies still resonates with people- people who may have been born decades after these films were made. Worth noting is that Weekend at Bernie's is a good deal younger than those films listed above, yet I believe it to have actually aged far worse than all of them.If you have some sort of nostalgic attachment to this film, I can understand that, and if you like it purely because of how ridiculous and stupid it is, then I can also see where you're coming from. But for me personally, I hated this film, and I kind of wish I had liked it, but hey, I guess you can't enjoy 'em all now can you. And I always try to be optimistic after watching a bad film by thinking to myself ""well, that'll just help me to appreciate the good ones even more.""There also happens to be a sequel to this movie that's apparently a lesser film- I shall avoid it like the plague and/or recent viruses.",Weekend at Bernie's

Like when the two idiots are jumping on the ferry. The idea is somehow original, but it's poorly developed. Making love to a dead man: are we supposed to laugh at that? The movie is sometimes way too slow. The director could have easily shaved 30 minutes from his film. And Andrew McCarthy is so annoying. Seems he's always shouting. Can't he talk like a regular human being? Skip this one.

34,mcfly-31,silly fun,7,23 July 1999,"Lotta fun with McCarthy and Silverman as two guys who uncover a scam in the office.  They present the info to their boss who's so grateful he invites them to his kick ass house for Labor Day weekend.  When they show up they find him dead and decide it would benefit both of them to let the parties go on with everyone thinking Kiser is still kickin'.  Contrary to what most say, the core of this film is not the dead body antics.  The real attraction here is the rappor between McCarthy and Silverman, who play very well off each other because their characters are such opposites.  And occasionally Kiser is thrown into the mix and the three make one of the more odder comdey teams.  When they do drag him along, its pretty good stuff, with them trying to fake everyone out that hes walking or waving.  And then the battering of the body, which is hard to not laugh at.  When Bernies being dragged or bounced or dropped its perfectly silly.  Even before the main action starts, theres some good stuff in the beginning dealing with Silvermans love life and McCarthys constant annoyance of him about it.  So at almost every point in the film theres usually something to laugh at.",Weekend at Bernie's

The coming of age tale of two junior associates getting themselves into a sticky situation all in the name of partying is one that is referenced ad nauseum throughout pop culture - even to this day.But when you actually sit down to give 'Bernie's' a try, it's hard to see how this film earned itself a place in cultural lore. Sure, there are some scenes that are noteworthy, but the entire premise is ridiculous beyond belief. The duo that is Jonathan Silverman's Richard and Andrew McCarthy's Larry is well cast for this kind of a film, but their schtick gets pretty old after a while. Still, there's no denying that many elements within 'Bernie's' have been borrowed or recreated in comedies that have followed in its footsteps.'Weekend at Bernie's' is one of those films that is a ""must see at some point in your life"" kind of movie if only to cross it off your list, but it's okay if it takes you a while to get around to it.",Weekend at Bernie's

There were a few funny moments in the movie, some of them were cringe and cheesy which I wasn't a fan of, but the rest of the humour was good and it made the movie entertaining to watch.

39,ThomasColquith,Better than expected,6,16 October 2021,"I had low expectations for ""Weekend at Bernie's"" so I am pleasantly surprised by how decent it was. It was very watchable, especially the first half, though by the end the story drags and the jokes grow stale. It was almost as if the writers didn't know how to wrap the story up effectively, which is a shame because it actually had a decent plot and set-up going for it. The negative of film is obviously the somewhat morbid main joke, but the film stays fairly light.This film lampoons and perhaps effectively depicts New York life more accurately and realistically than almost any other. It shows the city as it can be: hot, noisy, dangerous, insects, small apartments, pretty women, expensive prices, can't afford to park a car, two classes: upper and working class. It highlights the pervasive attitude of work hard and put in your time to get ahead, while the boss embezzles $2million to buy his beach house and boat. It shows the superficiality of it all, as Bernie's pretentious friends don't even notice that he's dead, they just say ""great party Bernie."" It also shows two young guys just starting out, looking for basic things, a home and a woman, but those seem to be monopolized by the wealthier and older men. And in the midst of all this there is the illicit side of things, the drugs and the mob. At least in the film the two protagonists come out all right, but you get the sense of what it's like here, to be the little guy amongst the big fish. Not sure if I'll rewatch though. My rating: 6/10.",Weekend at Bernie's
40,kooleshwar,A memorable one joke film with humour that unlike Bernie......... is not dead!!!,6,28 June 2006,"Let me be frank the only reason I rented this film was nostalgia and I must say I didn't really have many expectations from this film coming out of my experience with another film I rented for nostalgic value, The Pink Panther (I felt the humour had outlived its time).The movie starts out promisingly enough with the stereotypical bumbling nerd and his wacky carefree friend lost in the big bad world of corporate America.The encounter with the female temp and the meeting with Bernie provide a few memorable moments earlier in the film. In fact the opening sequence with the trip to beach itself sets the initial expectations high.Catherine Mary Stewart provides the eye candy throughout the movie, 80s style, and also serves up a decent performance. heheThe movie in fact follows through with one funny scene after the other taking a swipe at corporate America, the mafia, the glitterati etc.Then Bernie dies,....... and the movie gets even funnier as one after the other we are subjected to people interacting with Bernie as if he were actually alive.Hell I would like to go as far as saying that Bernie did better when he was dead then when he was alive.The movie peaks when Bernie meets his mistress and gives one of the best performance of his lives. That scene will clearly be one of the most memorable scenes in comedy movie history.However we do have a few memorable sequences such as the drunk bargaining, the parents house etc.Unfortunately it all goes downhill from there, with the abusive, bratty kid providing the only relief, when we are subjected to scene after scene of the same variety (oxymoron).This movie does the cardinal sin of the one joke movie and doesn't realise when to quit. Had this movie been 25 mins shorter it would have easily figured itself in the most memorable comedies of all time.The movie is crude, stupid and slapstick but lovable, the actors give good performances given the limited premise of the movie. As expected the dead Bernie clearly steals the show.I don't know but I felt an undercurrent of darkness in the comedy of this movie especially relating to Bernie's acts after his death and the way he was treated by others.In all a good movie with great nostalgic value and worth renting when you can think of nothing else.-'s one joke movie, doesn't know when to quit, pg-13 rating (i still cant figure out why if you are showing a sexual act but with no exposure it is OK to show to the kids), some characters caricaturish, second part far below expectations.+\-'s undercurrents of dark humour, slapstick.+'s single joke but bloody funny one, a host of memorable scenes specially in the earlier half, a few great one liners,decent performances, good eye candy, absolutely hilarious first hour.",Weekend at Bernie's

However, as soon as the story bags are packed and put onto the ferry of vacation the fun begins.I cannot say that there are moments of immaculate acting that make the movie outstanding, but the stiffness of Bernie is just unbelievably good. The humor really reaches that point when the night seems like a noon on its background. The dark tones together with moments of irony bring you tons of joy and surprises. Of course, it doesn't lack a certain level of complete stupidity but as soon as you get a hang of it, the journey takes a really pleasant turn.Feeling proud that now I can reference the movie myself I would say that even though the quality of jokes is not stellar, the plot seems unique and unpredictable.

It works very very well. The screenplay is perfectly created, with small characters filling great parts to create logic momentum to the weirdness. It is dark, but at the same time bright in the way a neon-filled 80's summer movie should be.Everything fits together neatly, and if you can go into this film with the right mood, expecting nothing but a stupid 80's comedy - you're going to have the best 100 minutes of your life.I keep coming back to this film. Just bought it and re-watched it on Blu-ray (in 2019), and it is still amazing. I still laugh out loud. I know the dialogue, I know what's going to happen, I know the pacing. But it is still fun.This is what you would get if Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay made comedies. One of the best movies ever made - and the reason for that is: it is entertaining.

I think my parents got invited to a wedding as I was too young to attend back then. So she brought over this movie. I didn't know what to expect but I was very pleasantly surprised back then.So all these years later I caught the film on IFC yesterday. I mean you know it's all right. Two regular joe's getting invited to the big cheese's getaway at work. They think for good times but in fact it's because Bernie wants them dead.Even as a kid I thought it was a movie when nobody picked up Bernie had died. But as a grown up I sometimes have to wonder if a statement was being made about how conceited people are. Plus yeah wouldn't the dead body start to smell after a while.

Terry Kiser should have gotten a strange Oscar for not acting, or acting without lines, or...how can it be described?One reason I love this movie is the color. This film and its horrible sequel have fantastic color that vibrates on the screen. It reminds me of another of my favorites, ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" in that respect. I wonder if the same company handled both.In any case, Bernie gets his and nobody cares. If there were a shed of decency in the sleaze it wouldn't have been funny. 'Ole Bern is the worst creep any of us have met (how many people have arranged your murder?).

Both may be competent as a sensitive co-stars in a drama, but neither one of these guys cuts it in a comedy. The dead guy, played by Terry Kiser, never made me laugh once, although he does play dead very well, and seeing him dragged around did make me laugh. I just hated it when he started dancing - wow, was that terrible.For some reason Barry Bostwick isn't on the cast list at IMDb and he's the biggest star by far in the movie, and its only redeeming aspect other than the high production values in gorgeous Caribbean locations, plus a stunning female co-star who thankfully compliments an ethnically diverse supporting cast.I think it's incredible that a movie with such a tasteless premise got made, and says much about the wide-open blinding wealth of 80s Hollywood. Movies should be about realizing the preposterous, but ultimately, the boring lead actors and a seriously middle-school-intellect level script ultimately make this period piece from the now-worshiped 80s still nearly as bad a movie as it was when it came out.",Weekend at Bernie's

Worst case some I guess doesn't have to love it & may even think it's a little stupid but that's kinda the point. It doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I've read some reviews on the movie & frequently would read how 1 joke can only be taken so far. Maybe true but it certainly went to the end of the movie so that's all that matters. Hey I'm an 80's kid so I grew up with the movie & wasn't a miserable adult when I saw it. So maybe it jades me a little but I don't think so. Cuz I do see some movies I think I loved as a kid only to be disappointed decades later on a replay. But every time I see this movie-even as an adult-It's just as good. Nostalgia doesn't hurt but I feel like even if I saw this movie today for first time I would love it just the same. The acting was great in the movie & lost count of the amount of times I laughed. It's not even that dark considering yet some people like to over-analyze everything it seems. Those who think it is bad for kids really need to get a life. My God I was born in 1979 so wasn't like a was a teenager the first time I saw it & it hardly scarred me. It's a friggin movie and even a 6 yr old can tell the difference so if your one of those parents who think it's too much for kids, ya need to re-examine your life. Terry Kiser should've earned a best actor for his role if ""acting"" performance mattered more than a role in POS film. If any1 comes away from this movie without laughing throughout & thinking it was bad then I feel sorry for you. You don't know what funny is.

Utterly tasteless, goofy, ridiculous, wonderfully funny movie with loads of quirky characters. Andrew McCarthy at his most charmingly loopy and Jonathan Silverman terrific as his straight arrow buddy. Great turn by Terry Kiser as  Bernie, who will not go away or play dead.

Throughout the whole movie the thought of how repulsive these two guys' actions were was in the back of my mind. Dragging around a dead body for a couple of days is not something I would usually laugh at. Most of my laughs (all two of them) came before Terry Kiser's Bernie character kicked the bucket.

Catherine Mary Stewart is reluctantly along for the ride as our two bumbling heroes try to get rid of their dead weight before somebody notices that he's no longer with us.

60,fineanimal,It just doesn't work.,2,19 August 2002,"Weekend at Bernie's really isn't a very good film. The premise--two wacky guys try to pretend their dead boss is not only still alive, but still the life of the party--may sound like it has potential on paper. But once the title character dies we suddenly realize that there is not much more you can do with a dead body than carry it around, move its head back and forth, wave its arms in the air, and so on. And that's exactly what happens here. For about an hour and a half.Andrew McCarthy shows some genuine talent playing the smarmy smooth-operator Larry, and Jonathan Silverman is equally adept as Larry's straight-arrow buddy, Richard. Even Terry Kiser is about as good at playing a dead guy as anyone could hope for. But in the end, this is a physical comedy, an action-oriented film, and the only action possible is for McCarthy and Silverman to carry a limp Kiser around while attempting to make funny remarks about what they are doing. Excessive performances by other characters, particularly the party-goers and mob killer, only serve to remind us that this is the comedic equivalent of a melodrama that has no plot.Perhaps with a more intelligent screenplay and a little less reliance on physical comedy Weekend at Bernie's could have had potential.",Weekend at Bernie's
61,aefrench,An enjoyable comedy,7,11 April 2010,"""Weekend at Bernie's"" is one of those classic 80's movies that has a fan following. This is an instance where a viewer has to suspend belief when it comes to the plot, but if you can do that, you will find that the movie is funny.Richard Parker and Larry Wilson are two young employees for an insurance company who discover an embezzlement scheme while reviewing financial data. The duo immediately go to their boss, Bernie Lomax, and inform him of their findings. As a result, Bernie praises their work, and invites Richard and Larry to his beach house for the weekend.It turns out that Bernie is the one who has conducted the embezzlement, and he wants his gangster friends to get rid of Richard and Larry. A plan is formed to kill them. However, the leader of the gang changes everything after Bernie leaves and informs one of his hit men to take out Bernie instead.Richard and Larry get to the beach and find their way to Bernie's house. Bernie is there, but has already been killed by the hit-man. Once they realize he is no longer alive, Richard and Larry panic, not sure of what to do. After this, a floating party invades Bernie's house, and the two do all that they can to make Bernie seem he is alive, and at the same time try to figure out what to do after the party leaves the house.Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy were perfectly cast as Richard and Larry, respectively. The script is lowbrow, but does have many funny lines. Don Calfa deserves mention as the hit-man who kills Bernie. He plays the role very well and also garners laughs. And of course, Terry Kiser does a great job portraying Bernie, and he creates his share of laughs throughout the film.""Weekend at Bernie's"" is one of those films that can be watched over and over and still make someone laugh. As previously mentioned, you must suspend belief, and if you do that, you can enjoy this movie. I definitely recommend it.",Weekend at Bernie's

This is the whole movie, all 90 minutes is this joke over and over again. It also takes way too long to get started. The first half hour spent far too much time on a building a plot that the film really had no use for. Like I said, this premise would have been a terrific SNL skit. A movie?

64,burbs82,Lighthearted gallows humor... (?),9,30 May 2009,"I consider 'Weekend At Bernie's' a rather bizarre classic. When I was a kid I remember it coming out in theaters and being a fairly popular film, but not being really interested at the time. I was eight and considering 'Ninja Turtles', 'Batman', and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' all came out that year, I can guess why a random comedy title with no action figures to sell it to children took the backseat (Although 'Last Crusade' of the three, still holds up and, ironically, had no action figures). However, several years later, mid-nineties, I caught the finale of the sequel (probably on USA Network), I was in full 80's retro mode, and what I saw was enjoyable enough for me to want to look up the '89 original.Based on situational (the ""sit"" in sitcom) humor, rather than slapstick, or non-sequitir), I laughed at several of the jokes the first couple of viewings, but what really makes this one stand the test of time are the unique underpinnings of the story, in which death itself actually becomes the joke.This may or may not be intentional, again it's played as a lighthearted comedy where mob assassins (the great Don Calfa ('Return of the Living Dead'[1984]) are depicted as bumbling buffoons who can't recognize corpses, but that's also an interesting aspect of the story. NO ONE notices that Bernie (Terry Kiser, ""Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood""[1987], ""Three's Company""[1977]) is deceased, despite the obviousness of it. We laugh at the notion that Richard (Jonathan Silverman) and Larry's (Andrew McCarthy) inventive but still unabashedly idiotic plan to make it appear as if their boss is alive, succeeds to a degree, but it's a sad epitaph for Bernie Lomax, a thieving and probably compulsive broker and financier, whose greed seems to have afforded him much popularity, but no friends to go along with it, which casts lowly, struggling desk-jockeys Richard and Larry in an even more sympathetic light.Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy are great as the two often clueless friends who stumble over an accounting error, and thinking that someone is embezzling money from Lomax's firm, they report it to good ol' Bern, who turns out to be the culprit. Bernie invites them over for a weekend at his luxurious island beach house with the intention of killing them, however Bernie's mob ties catch up with him and the guys arrive to find their boss dead. What to do, what to do...It's got a good soundtrack and score, and the island (filmed at Bald Head Island, NC) is beautiful. Also features the awesome Catherine Mary Stewart, of the cult classic 'Night of the Comet' (1984), in a small role as Richard's love interest, Gwen... and a hilariously evil kid obsessed with giving the dead a proper burial.Funny and unique comedy. If you've got the balls to look death in the face and LAUGH at his cheap wig, check out 'Weekend at Bernie's'. I also highly recommend the sequel, which forays into the supernatural (i.e. zombies and voodoo).",Weekend at Bernie's

Like a summer holiday where laughs are in no way in short supply - this film and all it stands for will get into your dreams.10/10 - you'll laugh again and again, and with repeated viewings, you'll be able to appreciate the higher level of complex humour that lurks within.",Weekend at Bernie's

70,MrBark,Classic Tragedy of 1980s Materialism,9,20 May 2004,"Many will say Weekend at Bernie's is a comedy, but is it really?  This review will contain SPOILERS, so discontinue reading if you do not wish to know the story.The tragic anti-hero is Bernie, a man who seemingly has it all.  He has a great NYC apartment, a house at the beach, a boat, a high-priced sports car, women falling at his feet, and a great toupee.  He is the symbol of 1980s material success.  Any of us would love to be in his position, right?Perhaps not, for all great tragedies possess a fall from grace.  Bernie is successful because of his involvement in the NYC organized crime underground.  This combined with his lack of self-control in regards to the Don's girlfriend results in his untimely end.The tragedy is this: in death, no one notices.  Bernie's supposed ""friends"" continue to use his boat, party at his house, drink his booze, and yet no one realizes he is dead.  The woman who indirectly caused his death defiles and molests his corpse without noticing. This is an insult not only to his person, but his sexual prowess as well.  It would seem Bernie lacked any real emotional attachments.  Instead, he plunged himself into the seedy world of 1980s materialism.  It was this world that would not only cause his death, but would also insult his humanity through the implication that his life was irrelevant.Indeed, Bernie became in death what he could not attain in life, a hero. While dead, Bernie's corpse protects two losers from meeting their own untimely ends at the hands of both the New York mafia and Neptune's realm. In death, Bernie was able to give pleasure to all those around him through his possessions and, in the case of his girlfriend, his body.  However philanthropy and necrophilia aside, all of these redeeming acts are meaningless because when those around him find out that he is really dead, some do not believe while others express shock.  However the shock is not from losing a dear friend, but from the realization that they were too absorbed in their material lifestyle to take notice of the recently departed.The tale of Bernie is a tragic one.  A man unloved in life and death, let his story guide you.  For it is not the material success that brings one happiness and love, rather it is the depth of friendship.",Weekend at Bernie's

I mean, you usually would know if you were sitting next to a rotting, ice-cold corpse. But even so, it's a movie (!), and you don't really question sci-fi flics for being unrealistic do you? So why criticize this one for it.The movie had a good build-up and showed an impressive flow of interesting characters, i.e. the party goers were a hoot. Also Larry and Richard show an amazing ability to work under pressure and come up with various clever solutions how to keep Bernie on the move. What you essentially need to see Weekend at Bernie's is an open mind and a very strong sense of humour.

77,felixtherat,Slow and ultra predictable. Doesn't make you laugh.,1,28 December 2015,"This movie has a weird effect on your perception of time. Everything happens 10 seconds after you already know it's going to happen - but then is not quite as funny as you imagined it.Apparently written/directed/edited by people who've never done comedy before, unless was simply a pacing problem due to lack of script - like a half hour episode that was padded out to be much longer. Every shot seems to have the pre- and post-roll frames kept in, like they didn't have any choice in editing due to a lack of material.The two leads are untrained, unseasoned and unbearable, and the writer doesn't seem to have been allowed time to finish or given a script editor. Style doesn't even redeem itself for its age, as there are plenty of contemporaneous black comedies/dumb comedies from its period that are paced and have enough jokes to fill a movie - you know, comedy movies written by experienced comedy writers, performed by skilled comedy players - those guys you have to pay fees to.A quick note on the baffling following this movie has - what's intolerable is not that some say they enjoyed it (each to their own, I've no problem with that), it's the hyperbole people use, praising it to the extent they give the impression they believe the memorability of the film was deliberate, as if the movie makers might count themselves amongst those who find the movie funny. Seriously, this movie paid mortgages, guys, it didn't make people proud (or laugh). The 2 leads barely worked again, and neither did the writer. Why? Because they suck. Obviously. Get a grip!Bottom line - were you stoned (or 10) when you watched this? Then try watching it again - especially before coming here and telling people it's good.I've laughed more at a funeral.

I for one laugh my butt off every time I watch this movie. It is one of those movies that cheers you up if you are having a bad day. The duo of McCarthy and Silverman is almost flawless. They are wonderful to watch. Together they almost remind me of classic pairs like Laurel & Hardy or Abbot & Costello. If you just sit back and relax this movie can really tickle your funny bone. It even might make you `drop dead from laughing'. Oh.was that to corny.sorry. But honestly, this is a good film. Give it a try someday when you have nothing else to do or are having a party. (But beware just rent this one. The second one, although it has its moments, doesn't meet up to the original)",Weekend at Bernie's
82,Certified_Teacher,My official Labor Day film,10,13 May 2012,"What ever happened to comedies like these? I have loved this movie since childhood. The brilliant Andy Summers' (Guitarist of The Police)score sets the tone of the silly comedic situations that occur within the beautiful atmosphere of the Carolinian island where the film was shot. Two young NYC guys who have been forced to work weekends at their insurance company job with no end in sight until they uncover a major finding at the firm. Their boss invites them to a spend Labor Day weekend in the party-going atmosphere of ""Hampton Island"" to reward their efforts. The pair are exposed to the high end lifestyle of bikini clad women, golf carts, and speed boats for the first time in their lives as they find their host/boss dead of an apparent drug overdose. The party atmosphere, in addition to other drama, takes over before they can properly alert authorities.As silly as this comedy is, it is still well written and acted. The decor and wardrobe will bring you back to a carefree late 80's era. Picturesque beach scenery mixed with amazing weather will make you want to visit Bernie's weekend getaway community. I highly recommend this movie.",Weekend at Bernie's
83,CasualMovieWatcher,"Very silly, crude, and vulgar movie.",1,17 December 2020,"If you want to watch two bumbling, profane, and perverted young men and other perverted and immature adults, this is the movie for you. Packed with immodestly and barely dressed young women, alcohol, and irresponsibility. It's not that funny. The joke of pretending Bernie is alive gets old quick. They should have called the police by the way, like normal people. I had to skip through a lot of the movie. Basically once the it's established that Bernie is dead you get to laugh at them fumbling around and falling down, gawking at women, and talking to women for the rest of the film. Definitely not gonna watch it again. Poor comedy. 30 years ago people were the same as they are today. There's nothing special about the setting of the film or the people in it, just a silly and crude comedy made in the late 1980's, nothing special about it or that time period.",Weekend at Bernie's
84,rupzal,Dumbest caracters Ive ever seen in a movie!,4,4 June 2021,"Seriously overrated. It wants to be funny but all the caracters are so unrealistically dumb, that made me feel annoyed. I only gave 4 because it has a late 80s vibe thats actually cool.",Weekend at Bernie's
85,rob_holthaus,Great,10,9 November 2020,"I never write reviews but noticed this rated at only 6.4 and felt sad. This is truly a perfect comedy. Those that gave it a bad review can't seem to let reality go and just enjoy the humor of it. Somebody even said the plot is ""not believable"" and therefore didn't like the movie. OMG really? Loosen up dude.",Weekend at Bernie's
86,otis-3,Over-the-top take on the what-to-do-with-the-body theme.,10,6 September 1998,"This Ted Kotcheff-directed black comedy takes the dead body theme to the max. Terry Kiser is superlative as the unfortunate Bernie - he manages a ludicrous death smirk that adds an extra absurdity to the ridiculous situations he ends up in. Andrew McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman play off each other with lots of energy and friction, successfully pulling off the straight man/wacko guy dynamic. Aside from the hilarity, there's a fluffy romantic subplot, an excellent faux-Bob Marley score by Andy Summers from the Police, and just a touch of warm fuzzy character growth in the end. Well deserved of cult status.",Weekend at Bernie's
87,Roo-9,A film which contains humour that will never decompose... unlike Bernie!!,10,22 May 2001,"I first saw this film at about 2:00am one morning and knew that I had to have it. Okay, so it's a one joke movie, but hey it is still incredibly funny. It is a film that encapsulates the eighties and the two lead roles are perfect. The actor who played Bernie's corpse deserves an oscar as although he doesn't say a single word it honestly seems he is dead!! Classic moments include Bernie waterskiing and Bernie making love to his girlfriend (he is of course dead in both scenes.) A must for anyone who wants a good laugh.",Weekend at Bernie's
88,curryspice,Best Movie Ever,10,6 February 2010,"I just watched this movie with my friend, and I must say, after watching it I felt blessed to even have come in contact with such a masterpiece. There are so many phenomenal undertones and moments that make you think, ""what were these fine people thinking when they made this contemporary genius piece of work?"" It was like walking through the Museum of Modern Art. Can you believe the sets? Wow! This was a blast from the past. I couldn't walk away from the screen. Well, I did once, but only to take a crap. While I was plopping out shits, I contemplated some of the glorious undertones that I had mentioned earlier. These NYC businessmen use their dead boss for their own sexual gain. They ignore his dead body when bodacious babes come into their sight. Otherwise, they use him as a prop to have fun at parties. They are primarily concerned with their own primal instincts, rather than the safety of others. By ""others"" I mean the Boss' mistress who ends up having sex with his dead corpse. This is necrophelia, and is illegal, although she had no idea (???). Sure, there are many plot holes (rigor mortis anyone? Pooping your pants after death), but it was a lovely romp, that made me have some very positive existential thoughts. I think more people should have hilarious times with their friends' dead bodies. I hope people put me in wacky situations after I die!",Weekend at Bernie's
89,hugedeal,TV commercial/trailer as funny as movie,8,21 January 2006,"I remember what made me go see this movie (which I found hilarious)was the as funny commercial on TV when it was released. It was a summer release just prior to the 4th of July. McCarthy and Silverman stood on each side of a beach chair holding the obviously dead Hawain shirt clad Bernie with a lit sparkler in each hand, arms folded across his chest.Bernie begins to slide,sparklers and all slowly to the floor as they smiled and talked of what a fun 4th experience it would be to come see the movie. It loses some in the translation here but if you have seen the movie you will understand. I new with morbid humor like this I had to see the movie and was well rewarded. If this is on DVD I hope the commercial is included.",Weekend at Bernie's
90,ReelSplatter,A cinematic triumph,10,13 January 2007,"Astounding, life altering, tour de force. These phrases don't even begin to do justice to the masterpiece that is, ""Weekend at Bernie's."" Where do I begin? Is it the life changing story, the celebration of love, or the affirmation of all that makes us human. ""Weekend at Bernie's"" provides not only an insight into death, but into life itself. Ordinary people would take this movie at face value, but it takes a truly enlightened mind to appreciate all that is ""Weekend at Bernie's."" In death, Bernie Lomax, an ordinary CEO, caught up in the corrupt ways of today's modern business, has somehow taught us to fully appreciate all that we have. Whether we are a millionaire with a smokin' hot hosemonster girlfriend like Bernie, or bumbling, bottom of the ladder cubical slaves, such as Larry and Richard, we can all learn a little something from the life and death of Bermie Lomax. That leads me into my next point, Lomax. Bernie Lomax, cut down in his prime. But the writer, Robert Klane, has crafted quite an irony. His very name speaks of oxymorons. Lo-max. Bernie had it all, a successful insurance business, money, cars, woman, anything he wanted, Bernie could have. But while he was at the ""max"" of his life, he was also at the ""lo."" Under this gilded facade, lied a troubled soul. What drives such a man, to such depths? My only gripe, is that the director was not able to delve more into the past of Bernie. Rumor has it that the original script was not so much a story, but an epic, rivaling such classics as ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"", and putting to shame ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" In the movie, as well as in real life, Bernie touched the lives of many. Larry and Ricard were two cogs of corporate society, trying to claw their way to the top. Little did they know that Bernie had other plans. However, as I watched the movie, I wondered to myself ""How can we blame him?"" Today's society has corrupted us all, and all Bernie wanted to do was protect his interests. If anything, Richard and Larry are the real villains of this film. They allowed themselves to be subjected to oppression of today' business world. After all, did they not parade Bernie's corpse around for personal gain? In the end, I've learned so much from ""Weekend at Bernie's."" What you see as silly, mindless entertainment, I see as a masterpiece of cinema. Don't let yourself be persuaded otherwise. Please, for your sake, and mine, see this film. It will change your life.",Weekend at Bernie's
91,meryetc,My mom thought it was funny but not too much,7,27 May 2020,"The start was too slow and the movie hasnt aged too well, it has too many transphobic, homophic and mysoginistic jokes that turn out too hard to ignore. However, the performance was nice and at some points I really enjoyed its humor.",Weekend at Bernie's
92,TommyS-5,Top 5 Greatest Movies Ever,10,8 February 2006,"For A Movie To Consistently bring shear enjoyment and happiness every time you watch it and I mean Every time you watch it, you know there's something special about it. I'm 29 years as I write this and I was 12 years old when this came out. I was enjoying 6th grade summer down at the good old Jersey shore. The movie exemplified the late 80's ""feel good"" personality. As for the movie, the chemistry between Andrew McCarthy And Jonathan Silverman was just amazing and magical to say the least. Andrew McCarthy reminded me of myself and Jonathan Silverman reminded me of my best friend. The movie just makes me feel good every time I watch it and yes I own the DVD. Rock On Bernie and let's hear it for the 1980's and especially 1989 baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tommy New Jersey",Weekend at Bernie's
93,Paul-234,Watch this film,10,10 June 1999,"This is probably one of the most absurd films you are ever likely to see and also one of the funniest. If you can't laugh at the sight and sound of a corpse hitting marker bouys then you have no sense of humour. I frequently found myself in tears of laughter and still laugh at it despite repeated viewings. Do yourself a favour: watch this movie, put away the cares of the world and just enjoy yourself.",Weekend at Bernie's
94,Bio&Swede,A delight for necro fans and non-necro fans alike.,7,7 September 2000,"The plot of this film could be taken from the pages of any regular newspaper in the world. Dead man seems to be alive, but isn't. Infact the film is based on a real story that happened to two French men while vacationing in Hawaii. That is where the movie really shines.This film should have been nominated for an Oscar, honestly.A delight from start to finish. Non necrophiles will get a kick out of this too.7/10",Weekend at Bernie's
95,Partridgeimo,Dead Guy walking!!!!,10,21 January 2002,"The film focus' on two New York office workers, Larry(Andrew McCarthy) and Richard(Jonathan Silverman) who are invited to their boss' posh beach house at Hamptons in Long Island, after uncovering an elaborate scheme of fraud and embezzlement in the company. Thinking they can 'work their way up the corporate ladder' they accept, only to find their boss Bernie(Terry Kiser) dead. Scared that they may be accused of Bernies death they must pretend that Bernie is still alive. This is where the fun really starts, as Larry and Richard become more and more creative in ways of making Bernie seem alive. In one scene they tie their shoe-laces to Bernies to give the impression he is walking. The most entertaining scene has to be the beach party, in which none of the guests even notices Bernie is dead to the world, and instead continue to talk to him as if he is alive. This film is a wonderfully morbid black comedy, which dishes out the laughs thick and fast. I first saw this film when i was about 13, and thought it was the funniest thing i had seen in a long time, and i recently found it on DVD, and i still think it is a great film. Please, please check it out, you wont be disappointed.",Weekend at Bernie's

97,knstam,"A great ""black humour"" comedy",9,4 September 2004,"This is a great ""black humour"" comedy - I gave it 9 out of 10. Judging by the low rating most of the people here are giving it - they ""can't handle the truth"". Maybe that's because most of the people are constantly brained washed by Hollywood type comedies - sweet and romantic or alternatively rude and full of body parts /smells/sounds/etc. But wait - those comedies also have to ""educate"" us, always at the end of the movie, with a ""deeper message"" - the meaning of life, love, god, peace and happiness to all the world, blah, blah, blah... So for those of you that have to have a deeper meaning - did you noticed how many real friends, one that will noticed that he is dead, for instance, Bernie had? Maybe life in the fast lane is not as glamorous as it seems...",Weekend at Bernie's
98,t-harrington,"A fun film, not to be taken seriously",9,2 January 2005,"I'll admit I was very young when I first saw this film. I fear viewing it again would ruin the experience for me, and expect I wouldn't like it half as much. When I first saw it however, I thought it was great. Perhaps for a younger audience, despite the age rating. The film revolves around two guys who have been invited to their Boss' (Bernie) home after one of them uncovers a problem with the company's finances. It turns out their Bernie is actually stealing from the company and invite them both to his house to have them both killed. However, Bernie is the one who ends up dead. I'd recommend anyone to see it, easy viewing not to be taking seriously.",Weekend at Bernie's
99,kencpotter,Not recommended for 3-digit IQs,1,16 May 2016,"Although I've always enjoyed slapstick (Ernest, Naked Gun, Monty Python, etc.), I absolutely hated this movie. Furthermore, I noticed that my more intelligent friends also hated it. And it has nothing to do with it being ""dark"", or a ""black comedy"", as others have described it. When this movie came out, I clearly remember that it was hugely popular among those without the capacity for sublime humor. If you liked Looney Tunes as a kid, then you will probably hate Weekend at Bernie's. If you preferred Scooby Doo or Speed Racer, then you'll probably love this movie. If you preferred ""Friends"" over Seinfeld, then you will definitely love ""Weekend at Bernie's""",Weekend at Bernie's

101,Jefferson Lake,Pure class...,6,2 May 2000,"This film, like many great 1980s comedies, is best when not taken seriously, and preferrably when half-cut. There are many great variations on a theme in this film, and also several great set pieces - for example, the scene when Richard and the girl are on the beach and the corpse washes up next to them. You could see it coming, but the timing and effect did not disappoint. A must for all 1980s comedy fans.",Weekend at Bernie's
102,clantikilead,Awesome. Awesome to the max,10,20 June 2006,"this is a really great movie. the funniest part is when Bernie falls out of the back of the boat.and my friend liked when they had Bernie propped up against the stairs and the assassin walked in, with Bernie smiling at him!!! And when the assassin is tied up by Larry. Then they run out of gas for the boat, And have to paddle back with Bernie as a float!!! This has got to be the best comedy I have ever seen! And if you like this, you will definitely LOVE the movie: ""Bruce almighty"". I just can't start to tell you how much i love this movie. It is so funny you will laugh 'till your lungs explode!!And it's very hard to get that from me, as i am a critic. I give this a 5-stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Weekend at Bernie's
103,latinothunder7,Die Laughing,10,26 May 2002,This movie is great from start to finish. The characters are well developed and Andrew McCarthy(The Joy Luck Club) and Jonathan Silverman(The Single Guy) play wonderfully off of each other. The Dialogue was better then that of any modern made comedy I have seen. This is a dark comedy but for the family which is something I have never seen done before. This movie is unique and over the head of anyone who didn't like it.,Weekend at Bernie's
104,wymck,Manos de Piedra reference,10,21 May 2006,"After Larry delivers a knockout punch to would-be assailant (Paulie), he struts around, saying, ""Manos de Piedras! Hands of steel!"" But when translated from Spanish, ""manos de piedra"" doesn't mean ""hands of steel,"" it means ""hands of stone."" Is the director trying to say our hero Larry doesn't know his Spanish? No, I think the director is saying that Larry doesn't know Spanish at all, and also doesn't know his boxing trivia.In 1988, when this movie was being filmed, there was a prominent Panamanian boxer named Roberto Duran (b.1951). Duran's nickname at the time was ""manos de piedra,"" because he allegedly punched out a horse at the age of 14.",Weekend at Bernie's
105,tom_bomb85,A timeless comedy with a difference,10,15 September 2005,"I first saw this movie on TV a couple of years after it was released, when I was 6 years old in about 1992, but it remains one of my favorite movies. I've been watching it ever since then and I'll never be bored of it! Considering its a movie from the 80's it's still pretty funny and can be shown amongst recent films and not really be outdated. The comedy's excellent, with funny dialog making the film not dependent on sight gags, which are hilarious anyway! The comedy chemistry between the 3 main actors is priceless, which makes me wonder why there weren't more movies made with Jonathan Silverman and Andrew McCarthy together. For me, the pair were one of the 80's comedy highlights.It remains a timeless comedy masterpiece, standing out amongst the many 80's comedies, and way ahead of the countless turkeys made in that decade. Some many people groan when 80's movies are mentioned, but the mere mention of this film title, I've noticed, never fails to bring an instant smile to the face and a nod of approval.For me, this will always remain one of my top 5 favorite movies. The memories it brings back ensure I will always love it. I always enjoyed watching it as a kid with my friends, discussing it at school and quoting from it, which I find, at 20 years old, I'm still doing.I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a comedy with a difference. It is a black comedy, but with everything; clever dialog, hilarious sight gags, action and a bit of romance. Brilliant.",Weekend at Bernie's

The only problem is that it's pulled it off so well, that even the murderers themselves think the dead guy is still alive!It's not an 80's classic like The Breakfast Club. A Weekend At Bernie's is simply a goofy movie to kill 2 hours, but it's nowhere near the group of bad movies like ""Baby Geniuses"".",Weekend at Bernie's
