0,TheLittleSongbird,Shyamalan's second best film,9,7 January 2012,"For me, The Sixth Sense is M Night Shyamalan's best film, but Unbreakable comes very, very close. Maybe it is not a movie for everybody, due to some parts dragging and rambling on just a tad, but it is a thoughtful, moving and compelling film.It is a very well made film with beautiful, brooding cinematography and striking scenery. Unbreakable also features my personal favourite James Newton Howard score for any of his collaborations with Shyamalan, it is so gorgeous and subtle. Even with the odd draggy moment, Unbreakable does have a very enthralling story that resonated with me a lot. Like The Sixth Sense, it deals with the supernatural genre but takes it to a thought-provoking and surreal level.The pace is measured, and for the most part it works. The script is thoughtfully written as well, the characters are interesting(I don't think Willis has had a more involving character than the one he has here) and Shyamalan's confidence and assurance further adds to the many impressive things about Unbreakable. Bruce Willis and Samuel L.Jackson are both fantastic, and one wonders why they didn't do more together.Some have been dismissive of the ending, I actually thought it was fine, though I was underwhelmed by it on my first viewing a few years back. I did say before that The Sixth Sense's ending was the only one of a Shyamalan film that worked, after re-watching Unbreakable I take that back. I still think though the others were either needlessly melodramatic(Signs), laughable(The Village) or both(The Happening). All in all, a great film and one of Shyamalan's better ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Unbreakable
1,Leofwine_draca,Shyamalan's second masterpiece - and his last good film,9,24 November 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to THE SIXTH SENSE is a remarkable one; remarkable in the sense that it's very nearly as good as the film that made Shyamalan's name famous, and that it proves that he wasn't just a one-hit wonder. UNBREAKABLE offers up the same kind of intense spooky atmosphere as his first film, and yet isn't a horror movie at all. Instead, it's a gripping thriller that draws you into the lives of a diverse bunch of characters and doesn't let you go until the very end.Every element is just right in UNBREAKABLE, from the superb acting to the music. The deliberately slow pacing of the movie may be off-putting to some (and, I admit, I did find some moments in the middle hard going) but works in creating realism and building up tension. There is little in the way of action in the film, but when it happens, it's extremely suspenseful and absolutely riveting (two set pieces, one involving some subway steps and the other a janitor with a dark secret, are phenomenal, and the latter actually had me moved and in tears at the cinema). Criticism has also been levelled at this film's ""silliness"" in places, in that it concerns a man who may be a superhero and the comic-book link is always strong. This just isn't so, as these elements help to make the movie fantastic in both senses of the word. It's probably the best comic book film I've seen as, unlike over-the-top others, the subtlety of the film and the fact that its set in the real world - unlike Tim Burton's fare - give it an extra involving edge. Forget Batman and his rubber suit; this is the real thing.Bruce Willis is, once again, a revelation, and a mile away from the two-dimensional wisecracking characters he was playing ten years ago. His moving, subtle performance really draws us into his character, creating a real man with real emotions and experiences whom we care about very much. Acting honours also go to Samuel L. Jackson, who plays perhaps the oddest character of his career, an sufferer of a brittle bone disease which sees him walking with a stick or in a wheelchair for the entire film. Jackson's presence is an intense and commanding one. The supporting cast is also great, from Robin Wright Penn as the haggard, tired wife to Spencer Treat Clark as Willis' son, who, while not being as endearing as Haley Joel Osment, is still pretty good.Of course, with it being a Shyamalan film, there has to be a twist ending. At first I considered the ending here to be trite in nature, but it's grown on me since I watched it last night and I now think it was a very good one after all. It may not match the jaw-dropping final moments of THE SIXTH SENSE but it provides a fitting conclusion to the film. With masterful direction, and intelligent, literate script, oodles of tension and fine acting, UNBREAKABLE is definitely one of THE films of 2000. Addendum: I recently reappraised this movie and found myself enjoying it even MORE than the first viewing. The twist ending now seems to be so obvious yet so brilliant. Congrats to all involved with the making of this masterpiece.",Unbreakable
2,SnoopyStyle,Creepy but slow,5,26 April 2014,"Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)'s birth was a difficult one. He was born on 1961 in a Philadelphia department store with broken arms and legs. He is constantly getting hurt and loath to go outside. His mother bribes him with comic books. He would become an avid comic book collector and study. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding the train when it derails. He is the sole survivor without a scratch. He has a wife Audrey (Robin Wright) and a boy.Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan is playing around with the traditional structure. He has extended the first act beyond any normal reason. Most of the movie is the first act of a 3 act story. It spends most of the movie in a ponderous slow moving introduction that finally reveals the truth. While the reveal is interesting and unforeseen, it isn't the Sixth Sense and lack the satisfaction.This is a superhero movie that Shyamalan has drained most of the action and excitement from. It's deliberate and that creates a certain tone. There's a creepy tone that permeates throughout. The movie starts with a massive train wreck. It's an easy action scene but Shyamalan doesn't use it for a reason. He wants the slow creep. It's an unique movie but not necessarily a compelling movie.",Unbreakable
3,classicsoncall,"""You can't let bad things happen to good people, right?""",9,2 March 2014,"In the Silver Age Superman comics, a frequent theme that writers used was the concept of the irresistible force against an immovable object. That's not quite the story here, but since comic books play such an important backdrop to the story, I think it's worth mentioning. Director Shyamalan finds a unique way to counter the forces of good and evil in this film, but it's not until the twist ending as it were, that we come to realize that Samuel L. Jackson's character had a hideously disfigured mind to go along with his easily breakable body. I guess there were some clues along the way, like the repeated references to the three particular 'accidents' that Elijah Price kept alluding to, but that by itself wouldn't have been enough to betray his character.I like this story, I like it a lot. From the very outset, the character of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is revealed through various scenes to be a very believable person. He's the only survivor of a violent train derailment, his marriage is on the brink, his son worships him, and his job as a security officer which doesn't seem like much, turns out to be one where he protects other people. Yet it's his very ordinariness that masks an as yet unseen ability to read others, brought to the fore once Elijah explains that he needs to develop his talent by being around other people.I've thought about the comic book/super hero angle as it relates to the picture, and I don't know if it was really necessary. Almost certainly, the opening scenes citing comic book collectors is bound to turn off a lot of viewers who will say that comics are for kids and not to be taken seriously. If I were making the film, I probably would have left that out and just started right in with the story. Making the connection later, say when David first visits Elijah's shop, might have been a better way to introduce the super hero concept. I also had to question the unlikely coincidence of Elijah hooking up with David's wife (Robin Wright) as his therapist; it could have been the result of Elijah's secretly checking out David's background, but that was never mentioned specifically.Those few quibbles aside, I think this was a well written and well developed story. For Shyamalan, this picture made two winners in a row following ""The Sixth Sense"" of the prior year. Then unfortunately, at least for me, he had three disappointing films with ""Signs"", ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"". Of the first two, I think this picture had the better twist at the finale, or at least the one I didn't see coming.",Unbreakable
4,lee_eisenberg,M. Night Shyamalan's last really interesting movie so far.,7,13 March 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan followed up ""The Sixth Sense"" with the not-quite-as-great, but no less fascinating, ""Unbreakable"". Bruce Willis plays Philadelphia security guard David Dunn, who survives a train wreck that kills everyone else. After this, he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes his bones to break very easily. Elijah is convinced that David is as strong as the superheros in comic books. But what is there about either of these men that remains to be discovered? As in his previous movie, Shyamalan creates a bleak setting that may be about to undergo a mind-shattering change. This one isn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but you will be shocked at the end just the same. Watch for Shyamalan as the man whom David investigates at the stadium.",Unbreakable
5,jboothmillard,Unbreakable,7,23 September 2005,"The first time I saw it I thought it rubbish (somehow), but watching it again, I can see why it is four stars, and it is a pretty good film from director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense). The film begins with the birth of a prominent character, who almost immediately after being born broke some bones, he was born with brittle bones, easy to break. Then the story moves to security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) miraculously being the lone survivor of a mile-long train crash (that you find out later was not accidental), and with no injuries what-so-ever. It is after that David meets that brittle-bone guy, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"", who runs a comic book art gallery, and he believes not only that they have links to the truth (and they are merely money-making media exaggerations), but that they are linked. He believes that David, being strong and not able to injured, is the opposite of what Elijah is, oh, and he has a weakness, water. The two scenes you can really believe this ""mythology"" could be true, are when David asks his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) to keep putting more heavy stuff on exercise weights, and during a fight with a crook. Also starring Forrest Gump's Robin Wright Penn as Audrey Dunn and Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's Mother. This is quite a good film that does not hype the superhero format, and darkens it into a thriller genre. Oh by the way, it was Elijah that caused the train crash, he caused many incidents to find an opposite of him, i.e. someone that would survive. Very good!",Unbreakable
6,Woodyanders,A different kind of super hero film,9,27 February 2018,"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan wisely eschews big splashy special effects and elaborate action set pieces in order to bring a more low-key, thoughtful, and even melancholy sensibility to the concept of the super hero. Average blue collar security guard David Dunn (a strong and subdued performance by Bruce Willis) miraculously survives a train wreck that kills everyone else on board. David is encouraged by physically frail, but extremely persistent and fiercely intelligent comic book aficionado Elijah Price (superbly played with sharp wit and quiet intensity by Samuel Jackson) to question exactly why he didn't perish in said disaster. Shyamalan grounds the inspired and intriguing story in a plausibly drab and gloomy everyday working class reality. Moreover, Shyamalan uses the fantastic premise to smartly explore the provocative themes of realizing one's heretofore untapped full potential, the need to know precisely why you were put on this earth, the burdensome responsibility those endowed with special abilities have to use those powers for good, and how the forces of good and evil tend to be total physical and spiritual opposites. Willis and Jackson do sterling work in the lead roles; they receive sturdy support from Robin Wright as David's estranged wife Audrey, Spencer Trent Clark as David's awestruck son Joseph, and Chance Kelly as a train station custodian who does home invasions on the side. Kudos are also in order for Eduardo Serra's sumptuous widescreen cinematography and James Newton Howard's majestic orchestral score. An excellent movie.",Unbreakable
7,ccthemovieman-1,Very Intriguing Film With Great Ending,9,1 May 2006,"This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it. Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).""Unbreakable"" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did ""The Sixth Sense,"" M. Night Shyamalan, so if you enjoyed that you probably would like this, too.....although it's so different I wouldn't want to predict who would like this film and who wouldn't. If you're open to try something different, give it a look.",Unbreakable
8,Tweekums,Is crash survivor David Dunn really a superhero?,9,13 May 2019,"When a train travelling between New York and Philadelphia crashes there is only one survivor; David Dunn... and he isn't even scratched. Shortly afterwards he is contacted by Elijah Price; a man who suffers from a condition that means the slightest accident causes his bones to break... leaking to him being nicknamed 'Mr Glass' as a child. Elijah grew up reading comics and now believes that David survived because he has superhero like powers. David is understandable sceptical but when he thinks back he can only recall one time he got injured. Does he really have superpowers or is he just very lucky?This is an enjoyable film that almost defies genre. As it starts it looks as though it is going to be a disaster movie but we see nothing of the train crash or its aftermath; just our protagonist talking on the train then waking up in hospital. Then when he survives and is approached by Elijah the viewer is encouraged to wonder whether Dunn really has powers; something he denies while his young son is keen to believe in. The story plays out like a superhero origins story where we don't know whether the protagonist has powers until it is almost over. Since this was written and directed by M Night Shyamalan a big twist is inevitable and while key aspects weren't a total surprise many key details were. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are on great form as Dunn and Price respectively. Similarly Shyamalan does a fine job bringing his story to the screen; eschewing the look of a typical superhero film for a deliberately drab look. The story provides plenty of tense moments; the best being when Dunn's son tries to prove his father has superpowers in just about the most dangerous way possible. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of Shyamalan's other films, fans of Willis and Jackson as well as people who enjoy superhero origins stories.",Unbreakable
9,ma-cortes,Thrilling and suspenseful film excellently played and compellingly directed by M. Night Shyamalan,7,24 June 2012,"Interesting film and one of the greatest successes of the magnificent filmmaker Night Shyamalan . This intriguing picture with twist ending revolves around a security guard named David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia . His marriage to Audrey (Robin Wright) is crumbling , and he's thinking of moving to New York . David learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident . He formerly had a car accident that was a pivotal point in David and Audrey's relationship. He meets a strange man (Samuel L Jackson) with Osteogenesis Imperfecta , a real but rare disease . At the end takes place a confrontation against a violent delinquent , some camera shots show David in a hooded raincoat , which may be to imply that he's some sort of a caped crusader.A suspense thriller with supernatural overtone full of intrigue , emotion , surprise and plot twists . Shyamalan came up with the idea for the film while filming ¨The Sixth Sense¨ ; of all the films he's made , this is Shyamalan's personal favorite and of course is set in Philadelphia , like most of his films . He is an avid comic book fan, which was made apparent in this film . As in comic books, the main characters have their identified color schemes , David's is green and Elijah's is purple , they show up in their clothes, the wallpaper and bed sheets in their houses, Elijah's note to David, and various personal items, among others. Several camera angles were chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene . Excellent performances from the two main characters , M. Night Shyamalan always had Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in mind to play the roles of David Dunn and Elijah Price. Enjoyable support cast as Robin Wright , Spencer Clark , Eamonn Walker , Leslie Stefanson and Charlayne Woodard, who plays the mother to Samuel L. Jackson's character, is actually almost a full 5 years younger than her on screen son . And as usual director M. Night Shyamalan makes cameo appearances in his own movies, like Alfred Hitchcock, one of his favorite directors , this time as a Stadium drug dealer . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Eduardo Serra . Marvelous and thrilling musical score by James Newton Howard who always works with the director . Well produced and directed by Night Shyamalam , many of his films have car crashes playing pivotal roles and involve two ordinary individuals with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them , one of the people either has connections to a child or is a child, and the one connected to the child is always having marital difficulties . Night Shyalaman is an expert on fantastic films plenty of intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in ¨Sings¨, ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in the water¨ , ¨¨The incident¨ with exception to flop titled ¨Airbender¨ . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching .",Unbreakable
10,BA_Harrison,A different kind of superhero film.,9,18 June 2016,"The first time I saw Unbreakable, I desperately wanted it to finish with Bruce Willis's character drowning in the swimming pool, his first attempt at being a true hero also being his last: it would have been exactly the kind of dark, ironic twist that I like. Having just watched the film again, I'm now more comfortable with M. Night Shyamalan's chosen ending: it's just as perverse, with it's pitiful villain Elijah—clearly insane—having killed hundreds, if not thousands of people simply to validate his own existence. Now that's dark!While not quite as brilliant as M. Night Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense—the pacing is perhaps a little too slow at times to make for the perfect experience—Unbreakable is still extremely compelling, telling the tale of a seemingly ordinary man, David Dunn (Willis), who has lived his life with a nagging sense of dissatisfaction, but who gradually comes to realise that he possesses extraordinary powers and finally answers his true calling. Instead of going down the corny comic-book route of having its hero sporting a spandex uniform to patrol the city streets, Unbreakable tackles the subject with a sense of realism, and is all the more riveting for it.Star Willis puts in yet another very credible performance under Shyamalan's impeccable direction; together the pair have made what must be one of the most intriguing and innovative superhero films ever made—and without the aid of any (discernible) expensive special effects.",Unbreakable
11,moonspinner55,Masterful filmmaking,8,28 February 2008,"A perversely enjoyable unease permeates this psychological thriller from writer-director M. Night Shyamalan, here following his commercial success with ""The Sixth Sense"" in top form. A comic book connoisseur with an alarming, lifelong bone density deficiency befriends a security guard who was recently the only survivor of a massive train derailment; convincing the survivor he may in fact be unbreakable proves to be quite tough...however, even super-heroes have a weakness. Meticulously mounted film features one of Bruce Willis' best performances; he is altogether convincing, vulnerable, touching, and sympathetic as a modern-day man afraid of what powers he may possess. The film does err on occasion (a sequence in a comic book shop at night is confusing, and the picture's main color scheme--steely blues and grays--becomes visually monotonous), however the wonderful script and performances take the movie to a higher realm for this genre. There is a great deal of art in Shyamalan's presentation (including a gorgeous shot of Robin Wright Penn being carried up the stairs), and he works wonders with the supporting cast--even the two-line players are perfection. ***1/2 from ****",Unbreakable
12,blanche-2,intriguing,8,14 September 2001,"Needless to say, after Sixth Sense, I watched this film with high expectations.  Though it's no Sixth Sense, M. Night is one of the most interesting storytellers around. He manages to hold the audience's interest even with a rather slow pace which somehow didn't feel boring. This is a film about skewed perspective - we see constant images of things upside down.  It's about opposites - comic book heroes and villains, ying and yang. And, as seems to be M. Night's trademark, it's about surprises.  I'll take one of his movies over any overhyped junk any day.",Unbreakable
13,Quinoa1984,One of the better films of the season,9,24 November 2000,"M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense was a very, very good example of exquisete storytelling wrapped around a good egg full of good acting and suspense.  Unbreakable isn't too much different, with only a few minor things making it no masterpiece.The story follows a average security guard in Philly played by Bruce Willis, who is in a train when it crashes, being the only survivor, with no injuries sustained.  Then, a avid (yet serverely physically sick) comic book collector played by Sam Jackson find him and if you've seen the previews, you get the point.  Some things in common with Shyamalan's past success (an unraveling plot, lovingly played out performances, conflicted ending) with not only the obvious, but also that he has such a trust in his audience of patience and understanding, it is a wonder films like these are made anymore.  With only flaw being a scene of comic book wonder, this film may not be as ground breaking as Sense, but it comes close.  Look for the writer/director in a scene wearing a blue jacket.  A-",Unbreakable
14,Coventry,"Mr. Glass, that's his name. That name again, is Mr. Glass",6,14 January 2020,"When I first watched ""Unbreakable"", upon its release in theaters in the year 2000, I thought it was a boring and overrated film. Now that I watched it again in 2020, I still think it is a boring and overrated film, but at least now I can easily bring myself to write a handful of positive comments about it as well. Quite a lot of things can change in 20 years' time, that's certain. For starters, M. Night Shyamalan hasn't made anything but rubbish after ""Unbreakable"", and continued to do so until the fairly successful ""Split"" in 2016, so it's a lot easier to label this one as of his finest accomplishments. More importantly, over the course of two decades, the film grew out to become somewhat of a unique trendsetter and simultaneously a type of underdog in its own sub-genre. Whether or not he intended for it to be one, ""Unbreakable"" sort of is a superhero movie. There have been dozens (far too many, in fact) superhero movies in the past twenty years, but in 2000 the concept was still fairly unique, especially considering the protagonist in ""Unbreakable"" - David Dunn - is a reluctant and highly atypical kind of superhero.Yours truly keeps on nagging that M. Night Shyamalan stole the basic concept for this film from the relatively obscure horror gems ""The Survivor"" and ""Sole Survivor"". True, both films came first with the idea of one single person walking away unharmed from a major disaster that killed hundreds of people, but ""Unbreakable"" admittedly is quite original in terms of linking it to superhero powers. After he miraculous survived a train accident that killed all other 300 passengers, Philadelphia security agent David Dunn is stalked and harassed by gallery owner and comic book fanatic Elijah Price. For you see, ever since birth, Price suffers from a physical condition that makes his bones extremely breakable, and he developed a theory that David Dunn must be his counterpart at the other side of the spectrum; - namely someone unbreakable. Why is this interesting? To be entirely honest, I still don't know, and this immediately leads us to what is still the bottom line: ""Unbreakable"" is a mainly boring and uninvolving film. The ideas are good and the integer performances (notably from Willis and Wright-Penn) are solid, but the slow pacing is intolerable and the ""big revelation"" at the end is quite ""meh"".",Unbreakable
15,hitchcockthelegend,Soon found out had a heart of glass.,10,30 July 2015,"It often gets forgotten just what an exciting talent M. Night Shyamalan was during the early part of his film making career. True that Unbreakable, with its deliberate slow pacing and left-field narrative, would (and has) proved to be not everyone's cup-o-tea, but there's a film making craft here, and a genius idea brought to vivid life, that makes a spectrum of film lovers lament how his career nose dived, how his ideas quickly got as stupid as his acting...Unbreakable challenges the thought process, spinning a story that's of a adult comic book heart, but also of a clinical human examination. The narrative is consistently ambiguous, holding the patient viewers in enthral as the cosmic conundrums come tumbling off of the screen. It's refreshing to find a story like this that is so devoid of cliché, where the wonderfully reflective Bruce Willis and the brilliantly fascinating Samuel L. Jackson feed off each other, their character's destinies superbly steered by cast and director. Unbreakable is a complex movie, but not needlessly so, its strengths are numerous for those of a keen eye and ear. It represents Shyamalan's most clever cinematic offering, to which the sad realisation comes to pass that he would never, as yet, be this smart and vibrant again. 10/10",Unbreakable
16,Theo Robertson,Great Movie,9,25 September 2003,"It's always the sign of a good movie when you feel for the characters . When your initial sorrow for a character in a film is replaced by a sense of guilt for having sympathy for them at the end then that is the sign of a great movie .There , that's all I'm going to say about the characters and plot of UNBREAKABLE in case I spoil the shock twist at the end which is every bit effective and even more original than M.Night Shymalan's SIXTH SENSE . It seems opinions are divided for this movie with some people thinking it's a disappointment while some people think it's a classic . I fall into the latter and if Steven Spielberg had directed this it would be hailed as a masterpiece",Unbreakable
17,preppy-3,Unbearable is more like it.,1,22 November 2000,"Spoiler ahead!!!!! Very slow, boring, pointless tale about a man (Willis) who is the sole survivor of a train wreck. He's contacted by another man who is born with bones that break easy (Jackson) and is told by him that they they are alike--just on opposite ends of the spectrum. There! I've just saved you 1 hour and 45 minutes of tedium. The story has no ending, no point at all and bores you to death by drawing out every single scene to its absolute limit. Also there's a twist at the end which was real stupid and didn't shock me at all--mostly cause I was so bored with the characters I could have cared less. Willis acts like a zombie the entire movie, but it's not really his fault--the script is pitted against him. Jackson actually makes his horrible dialogue sound realistic--a credit to this man's acting ability. Penn is excellent as Willis' wife. She's not in the film much, but when she is the film kickstarts to life. The actor who plays their son is only slightly less annoying than MacCauley Culkin was--take some acting lessons kid!

18,LeonLouisRicci,"If You don't stop that""You're in Big, Big trouble!""",8,20 December 2013,"This was back then, when there were High Hopes for Writer/Director Shyamalan and His second Film following the Very Good but not Great, The Sixth Sense (1998). Unbreakable is much better than anything He has done since. With abominable Movies like Signs (2002), The Lady in Water (2006), and After Earth (2013), by contrast, this is a Dark, Darn Good Film. A different take on the Super-Hero Mythology it is intriguing and draws You in but some of the descriptions of Heroes and Comics that the Script pretentiously pontificates makes one wonder if M. Night ever held one in His hand let alone read very many. The complete misreading of Artistic Style explanations on why Comics are drawn this way or that is just embarrassing.It is a Good Looking Movie although some self indulgence is glaring. Like a repeating Motif of upside down Camera Shots. What exactly that Symbolizes no one knows. Another irritating ""Style"" of the Director is to have much motionless placing of Actors and ""deep meaning"" pauses in Line deliveries coupled with a lot of staring and thoughtful, contemplative composing.But it does deliver enough quirkiness to be different and diverting and may just be the best Film this Director will ever make.

19,poolandrews,"""172,000 comics are sold in the US everyday."" I liked it.",7,7 August 2007,"Unbreakable starts as the Eastrail Train #177 from New York to Philadelphia derails with the loss of 131 lives, the only survivor is security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has walked away from the crash without a single scratch on him. Shortly after the crash he receives a letter from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) the owner of an an art gallery specialising in comic books & related artwork, Elijah suffers from a rare disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta which means he has very brittle bones which are easily broken. Elijah tells David that he feels there are people on the opposite side of the scale to him, people with very strong bones & great strength & him walking away from that train crash is proof that he is one of them. Elijah tries to convince David that he is a real life comic book superhero & that his unique powers should be used for good...Written, co-produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan Unbreakable was his follow up to the huge commercial success that was The Sixth Sense (1999) & both films have much in common, both are set in Philedelphia, both star Bruce Willis who again has a strong involvement with a young boy (no, not in that way...) & both have a genuinely effective & unexpected twist ending. I'll start straight away by saying that I think both The Sixth Sense & Unbreakable are really good films which I like & I find it hard to call one better than the other, if I'm honest I'd probably say The Sixth Sense is slightly better but it's a close run thing. The script which takes itself very seriously has an intriguing & fascinating premise, forget your overblown superhero flicks like Batman (1988), X-Men (2000), Spider-Man (2002) & Fantastic Four (2005) as this is very low key & tries to portray an ordinary man suddenly discovering that he has superhuman powers. Again though it's low key as he can't shoot lasers from his eyes or fly, in fact the whole film is very quiet & very ordinary which was obviously a deliberate thing on the filmmakers part. It's all here with his weakness, his arch enemy & using his powers for good but in a very subtle sort of way that I just liked. The dialogue is very sparse & not much is said, the character's are good & there are lots of little things they do or say that you may not pick up on the first time you watch it but suddenly fall into place as the story progresses. My only real problem is that it's a bit slow & the ending while having a nice twist feels unfinished & rushed.Director Shyamalan does alright although the film is a bit dreary to watch as all the colours are muted, it's as if the film takes place in a world where there isn't a sun & it's overcast all the time. There are no big action scenes or anything like that so don't expect any as the film relies on strong storytelling & an interesting premise. At least Unbreakable is something just that bit different & for that alone it's worth a watch. I wouldn't say it's ever scary like The Sixth Sense but it has a certain atmosphere to it.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 one has to ask where all the money went although the reported $20,000,000 Willis was paid accounts for a fair chunk of it. It's well made but not particularly stylish or memorable, I don't know it's just a bit drab looking if I'm honest although I'm sure that was intentional. The acting is pretty good although why does everyone whisper so often? I personally like Willis as an actor & Samuel L. Jackson so I don't have a problem with the cast except for the kid who is annoying but isn't in it enough to totally spoil it. According to the IMDb the usually terrible Julianne Moore was offered the part of Willis' wife & I'm throughly glad she turned it down/didn't get it.Unbreakable is a strange & different sort of fantasy film, it's not for everyone that's for sure but I have to say I really liked it a lot & recommend it. Shyamalan went on to make the alien invasion flick Signs (2002) next with Mel Gibson which I also really liked.",Unbreakable
20,zardoz-13,"No ""Sixth Sense""",6,2 February 2017,"Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film ""Unbreakable"" refers to its protagonist, football stadium security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has been born with an almost perfect body because his bones cannot be broken. Far less introspective and surprising than the enigmatic ""Sixth Sense,"" this atmospheric melodrama depicts the friendship between Dunn and an African-American, Elijah Price, nicknamed Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from an unusual bone disease designated 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta.' Basically, 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta' is a genetic disorder where bones break easily. In other words, Glass' surname reflects the extremely fragile nature of his body. The first scene in ""Unbreakable"" details the birth of Mr. Glass in a department store apparel fitting room. One of the men who takes charge of the infant discovers to his horror that the little boy's arms and legs are misshapen from where he fought to get out of his mother's womb. Later, we learn that Mr. Glass has become obsessed with comic book superheroes. Shrewdly, his mother (Charlayne Woodard of ""The Crucible"") used comics to coax her son out of the seclusion of their apartment. Glass becomes a leading authority on comic books as well as the characteristics of super heroes and super villains. He represents a strong villain because he reckons if he occupies one end of the spectrum then an 'unbreakable' hero occupies the other end. In his fiendish efforts to find the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Glass commits incorrigible crimes which eventually land him in a mental asylum. For example, he engineers a train wreck where everybody on board dies, except for our protagonist David Dunn.Eventually, Mr. Glass catches up with David after his miraculous survival without a broken bone makes news' headlines as the sole survivor of the deadly train wreck. Moreover, he takes a bizarre interest in him that Dunn doesn't reciprocate. Nevertheless, David's curiosity prompts him to search for information about his health that he has taken for granted. For example, he has never missed a day at work owing to illness. Later, he realizes that he was never injured in an accident that broke his future wife's leg. After the wreck, David cites an injury that convinced him from pursuing a promising career in college football. His wife, Audrey Dunn (Robin Wright of ""Forrest Gump""), is relieved to learn David has decided to hang up his cleats. Glass' inquiries arouses the curiosity of David's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark of ""Gladiator"") who loads up more free weights than David thinks possible to press and winds up impressing both of them. David pushes 350 pounds! Later, when Joseph is convinced that his father cannot be hurt by flying lead, a standoff occurs in the kitchen with Joseph threatening his dad with a revolver at point blank range. Of course, neither David nor his terrified wife Audrey believe that he is invincible where bullets are concerned, and they manage to persuade Joseph to put the pistol down. Reportedly, when George Reeves portrayed the Man of Steel on the television program ""Superman,"" a child approached him with a gun during a public appearance and tried to shoot him, but Reeves talked him out of it. He warned him that the bullet might ricochet off him and wound somebody else.The $75-million ""Unbreakable"" boils down to your basic clash of the titans. Mr. Glass has spent his entire life searching for David. Initially, David refuses to believe anything about him made him special. After the tragic train accident, David has second thoughts. One scene demonstrates both of David's two usual capabilities. A maniac forces his way into a residential home, kills the husband, ties up the two children, assaults the wife, and leaves her tied up with bleeding wrists. Meantime, David has the power of insight that enables him to tell who constitutes a threat to the public. Glass is on hand at the football stadium when David displays this power. Scrutinizing the spectators filing into the stadium, David points out a suspicious character wearing a cameo shirt. Our protagonist suspects this fellow may be packing a pistol out-of-sight under his shirt. At the last minute, the suspicious fellow steps out of line. Desperately Mr. Glass pursues him and falls down a stairway in his efforts to learn if he was toting a firearm which matched David's description. Indeed, this suspicious guy was carrying a concealed weapon! Later, David spots a maintenance man. They brush past each other, and David follows him to the house where the husband lies dead and the children are tied up. David attacks the maintenance man and gets his arms around his neck. The maniac slams David repeatedly against walls, smashing up those walls, but he cannot dislodge David who keeps him in a choke hold until the brute loses consciousness. At first, David and his family didn't trust Elijah, and they classified him as a nuisance. Their attitude changes, and the two become friends, until the final quarter of the action, when Elijah reveals his true colors, and David realizes that Elijah poses a threat. He orchestrated three terrorist attacks in an effort to find the man at the other in of the spectrum. Once, David recognizes Glass as a threat, he alerts the authorities.Clocking in at 106 minutes, ""Unbreakable"" seems to take forever to unfold. The ending is a let-down because Glass and David never tangle, but the character-driven action is momentarily engrossing until it concludes with an anti-climactic situation. Bruce Willis delivers a beautifully restrained performance, and he behaves just as we suspect a normal person would. The scene on the train before the accident is liable to draw the wrath of married women. David removes his wedding ring and makes a play for a female passenger who sits beside him. Samuel L. Jackson is just as good as Elijah but never really seems menacing enough. Despite the strong character study of two rivals, ""Unbreakable"" is by its dreary pace and its anti-climactic ending.",Unbreakable
21,grantss,"Good, but...",7,30 May 2014,"Mixed feelings about this one. It veers randomly between brilliance and lameness. On the plus side, it has the usual M Night Shymalan unexpected twists and smooth eeriness. Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance and Samuel L Jackson does the only thing he knows, cold intensity, and does it well. On the negative side there were too many meaningless tangents, plot holes and cringingly lame scenes.Entertaining, reasonably good, but, especially when you consider that this was M Night Shymalan's follow-up to the brilliant The Sixth Sense, disappointing.",Unbreakable
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"For the first time, my hat comes off to Shyamalan",7,13 February 2008,"I can't be claimed to be a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. Not by any stretch of the imagination. I've only watched one of his films(Signs), but what I hear about the others doesn't particularly help my view. But I must admit, this film did keep my interest throughout. The version I watched had been edited for content, and was about an hour and a half, not the two hours or so that IMDb lists. My interest in this stems solely from my being a long-time fan of comic books, and the media of them. That was the only reason I gave this a chance. I am not disappointed. Be aware that you shouldn't expect a comic book film... or an action piece based on comics. This is still M. Night, and from what I understand, his work is about the build-up, the atmosphere, and the twist in the end. On that, I can't help but be impressed, in fact by all three. The film has something of an undertone of comic books, without ever losing seriousness, as so often happens when the silver screen has such projected onto it. M. achieves that masterfully. Lighting, cinematography, editing, all top-notch. The acting hardly possesses any flaws. The writing is solid, though a few scenes and lines came off silly. The ambiguity and depth herein is commendable. The humor is a fitting dry wit. The film is disturbing at times. The references to both comics and comic book films are great. The twist, I found to be breathtaking. I won't claim that I got everything about this movie, but I was definitely intrigued. Pacing is deliberate. I recommend this to comic fans mature enough to appreciate a film that deals with the medium without colorful costumes or grand-scale fights... there are more of us than some might think. 7/10",Unbreakable
23,view_and_review,Unbreakable is untouchable,9,22 June 2008,"M. Night Shayamalan started out like gangbusters. The Sixth Sense is already a classic and Unbreakable should be. On one side of the spectrum is a man, Elijah (Samuel Jackson), that can hardly do anything without breaking his bones and on the other side of the spectrum is a man, David (Bruce Willis) who is nearly invulnerable. Elijah sets out to find who his polar opposite is and he does the most abhorrent acts to flush out his opposite.This is the second movie these two fine actors starred in and again they did a wonderful job together. You would figure that a movie with such a storyline would be action packed, but it wasn't. It was really reliant upon the story itself and the actors making it work. This movie was simply great and of course the ending was stunner.",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan's follow up to his break out hit ""The Sixth Sense,"" but in only his second feature, the trappings that have since gone on to utterly ruin his films and his reputation were already beginning to wear thin.Those trappings include lugubrious pacing; gray, dour production design; a tone almost silly in its degree of solemnity; and a ""twist"" ending that feels forced and anticlimactic.I've caught ""Unbreakable"" on T.V. once or twice since seeing it in theatres back in 2000, and while it's not a terrible movie, it's a perfect one to have in the background if you want to take a nap.Grade: B-",Unbreakable
25,ferguson-6,Comic Book Villain,8,27 November 2000,"Greetings once again from the darkness.  Hopefully you are reading this and any other review AFTER seeing this movie.  Too much information will rob you of much of the moviegoing joy during this one.  Understated performance by Bruce Willis vs. Flamboyant Samuel L. Jackson help deliver the remarkable story in true mystery fashion (not SLOW as some say).  Unique and cutting edge camera work, a brief scene with the director (becoming a Shyamalan signature) and unparalled symbolism make this a truly fun experience for a movie lover. Shyamalan has hooked us with his feel for the supernatural and things that we dream about.  Shyamalan understands and presents children in rarely seen, realistic fashion as seen in ""Sixth Sense"" ""Stuart Little"" screenplay and Spencer Clark in ""Unbreakable"").  My tidbit on this one is that The music is written by James Newton Howard who has become amazingly prolific with 25 film scores in the past 5 years.

26,anaconda-40658,Unbroken.,10,25 January 2016,"Unbreakable (2000): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright, Spencer Trent Clark, Charlayne Woodard: Director M. Night Shyamalan has created another masterpiece that is every bit as compelling as The Sixth Sense. Bruce Willis is the soul survivor of a train wreck that leaves him unmarked. He is a security guard at a stadium where he use to play football. There is a card on his windshield from ""The Limited Edition Art Gallery"" that specializes is comic superheroes. Samuel L. Jackson owns the gallery and questions Willis on his inability to get sick. Jackson was born with a fractured skull and his bones break easily. Tremendous performances from both Willis and Jackson among their best work since Pulp Fiction. Willis can sense wrongful acts just by bumping into people and what he discovers climaxes the film to great effect. Jackson is equally good with a great childhood back story. Robin Wright plays Willis's wife who is given a wonderful back story that allows her to elevate above conventions. Spencer Trent Clark plays his son who will learn a thing or two about superheroes. Charlayne Woodard plays Jackson's supportive mother who encourages her son to face his condition. Fascinating thriller in its examination of superheroes and human limitation. It also stresses that heroic people exist in everyday life. Score: 10 / 10",Unbreakable
27,AaronCapenBanner,Fate,9,15 December 2013,"M. Night Shyamalan directed this compelling film that stars Bruce Willis as David Dunn, a security guard at a sports stadium who comes to the attention of eccentric comic book lover Elijah Price(played by Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that David has hidden powers of healing because he was the sole survivor of a terrible train crash that killed over a hundred passengers. David scoffs at this, but gradually believes that Price may be right, which pushes his son Joseph to extreme measures, terrifying his wife Audrey. Elijah persists in his firm belief in fate, which will lead to a devastating revelation by the end... Stunning film is told with great imagination and sober-minded seriousness, which is most effective, leading to an unexpected ending that may blind-side the viewer, but on reflection(like Elijah says) we should have seen coming. Extremely underrated.",Unbreakable
28,FlashCallahan,Miraculously Unharmed.......,10,8 March 2012,"David Dunn's marriage is crumbling, and he's thinking of moving to New York. Then when he's coming home from a job interview, his train derails and he is the only survivor.More than that, he doesn't have a scratch on him.David is contacted by Elijah Price, who runs a comic book art gallery and suffers from a genetic condition that makes his bones very easy to break.Elijah has been a comic book fan all his life, and has developed a theory that they are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, and the superheroes they are about are based on real people.Elijah believes David may be one of these people. He has hardly ever been injured or sick, and he has tremendous strength, plus an uncanny ability to tell if someone is about to or has done something bad.David doesn't know what to think about the theory, or Elijah himself. However, events soon conspire to convince him he may be a superhero after all.....The first thing that you must recognise with this movie is the fact that the film relies heavily on comic book mythology. Like many superheroes, the main characters ('the hero') name begin with the same letters (as in Matt Murdock, Peter Parker) and he is always wearing green throughout the film.The same can be said for Elijah, He wears purple throughout and has a nickname (asin Dr Doom, or The Joker).The film works on so many levels, but reading the summary, you really think it shouldn't. Bruce Willis as a superhero? But this is one of his greatest performances, even better than The Sixth Sense, as he doesn't over do the David Dunn stuff, he almost plays the role without emotion.Shyalaman has made another great movie, relying on the viewer to catch things that are not written down for you (eg. The blood on the sheet getting bigger in the hospital before Dunn is discharged), and also the movie is very funny in places too.The relationship between Dunn and his son is concentrated the most, and the addition of the 'miracle' just brings the two closer. The father son part is the heart of the film and gives the movie emotional impact.Jackson too plays it low key in his role, and he dresses and has hair like a bad guy from a blaxploitation movie from the seventies, which may have been intentional on Shyalamans behalf.The soundtrack is awesome and really stands out when Dunn is touching people in the station. It has a steady mix of scares, laughs and some very tense sequences involving the two leads.The ending isn't quite as shocking as TSS, but it delivers and wraps up the film nicely.A great antidote to the Spidermans and Batmans of this world.",Unbreakable
29,Wuchakk,What if superheroes are based on reality?,7,4 October 2015,"Released in 2000, ""Unbreakable"" was M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his most successful movie, 1999's ""The Sixth Sense."" The plot revolves around a man (Bruce Willis) who becomes increasingly aware that he possesses superhuman abilities, including invulnerability. This attracts a man on the opposite end of the spectrum who can barely go a week without injuring himself (Samuel L. Jackson). The latter is seriously into superhero-type comics and begins to see the truth about the former. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play the wife & son of the protagonist while Leslie Stefanson has a glorified cameo.The movie scores high points for originality as the idea that superheroes are based on real-life people adorned with extraordinary powers is intriguing. The tone of the movie is akin to the slow drama with spiritual undertones of Shyamalan's other films, like 2002's ""Signs."" Unfortunately, the ending feels arbitrarily tacked-on and leaves a sour taste. Then again, it might enhance repeat viewings.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Philadelphia.GRADE: B",Unbreakable
30,The_Void,Unbreakable - what a load of twaddle!,3,4 February 2007,"I seem to remember my opinion of M Night Shyamalan going up slightly after watching this. Not that Unbreakable was any good - just that it was a hell of a lot better than the God-awful The Sixth Sense. Rewatching bad films isn't something I make a habit of doing, but this one came on TV at a time when I didn't have control of the remote, and since I remembered the film being the best of Shyamalan's works, I didn't run for the hills. Anyway, I'm not quite sure what I was thinking upon my first viewing; as not only is Unbreakable a stupid and rather boring film, it's also completely pointless, riddled with plot holes and fails to make it's audience care about anything they've spent over one hundred minutes watching by the time it ends. The film starts by showing the audience a baby with a bone disease. From there, we move onto a train accident in which David Dunn is the only survivor. He is sought out by a man named Elijah Price - the grown up version of the baby at the start. Price is a comic book aficionado, and has a theory about Dunn's miraculous survival - he believes Dunn to be a real-life superhero...Comic books aren't such a big thing here in England, so maybe this sort of thing will mean more to Americans; but even so, that doesn't disguise the fact that this is a story that doesn't really work in a modern context, and it's one that requires it's viewer to have the mentality of a young teenager in order to buy into what's going on. The plot requires the unlucky viewer to suspend their disbelief on numerous occasions, and this faith is never rewarded. Given Shyamalan's track record, it's obvious that this film is leading up to a big surprise ending, and not only is the ending not a big surprise - it's entirely stupid and doesn't make one once of sense if you think about it. It would seem that Shyamalan does respect his audience at all, and this is shown by the fact that he gives us any number of motives that no one in their right mind would harbour, and expects us to believe in them! The finale for the central character is simply dumped on the audience and feels pointless for that reason, and not even the star profiles of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson can save this one. Unbreakable is a great big joke...which isn't even funny since I've sat through it twice.",Unbreakable
31,zetes,a good follow-up to the smash hit The Sixth Sense,7,29 June 2001,"MAJOR SPOILERSThe fundamental flaw of Unbreakable is that Shyamalan clings tenaciously to the structure, pace, themes, characters and mood of The Sixth Sense. That film was the surprise blockbuster in August of 1999, so it only makes (financial) sense for him to emulate it, and the studio to approve it. Alas, although Unbreakable made a large chunk of money at the box office, that success was far below analysts' estimates and was technically a flop.
I had planned on seeing it, but a couple of friends had told me that it wasn't as good as The Sixth Sense. One friend told me that it was the worst major motion picture that he had ever seen and begged me to swear an oath never to see it. I told him that, just based on the artistic success of The Sixth Sense, I had to see it no matter how bad it was. I promised I wouldn't ""waste my money"" at the theater and waited until it came out on DVD. Heck, I didn't even rent it myself, but watched it after my brother had rented it.
And I found it rather good. Like I said, its major flaw is that it wants to be a second The Sixth Sense in every way. I wish the style would have been altered a bit. I would have especially liked it more if it were not so self-serious, for, unlike The Sixth Sense, which was easier to take seriously (my imagination can accept ghosts without much problem), Unbreakable is about the real-life existence of an invincible man, a super hero. I may have liked it even more if it were a bit more clever about its absurd reality. David (Bruce Willis) is an ordinary man, and his burgeoning super-hero identity is interesting to watch. It gives his character layers. However, Mr. Glass (Sam Jackson) is such an eccentric individual that it is hard to accept him in the sort of realistic setting Shyamalan puts him in.
I'd like to talk about the ""surprise ending"" in this paragraph. This is another misstep of sorts for the film. I think that the surprise ending of The Sixth Sense both clinched its success and harmed the artistic integrity of the film. Most of the audience couldn't give a damn about artistic integrity, let alone plain old integrity, and most of them rushed home to tell all their friends that they never saw that surprise coming and that they have to go see it again to figure out what they missed the first time. I knew a lot of people who thought that that film was bad on subsequent viewings. That is because, despite the makeup of the audience (and despite the presence of Bruce Willis), The Sixth Sense was actually an art film. It was very slow-moving compared to your average blockbuster (consider the only film that beat it in the b.o. that year: Star Wars, Episode One: The Phantom Menace), and the focus was on the characters and their relationships. In Unbreakable, unlike in The Sixth Sense, the surprise ending is so clearly telegraphed that you would have to be completely not paying attention to miss it. However, I did not disapprove of it as much as I did the ending of The Sixth Sense. Unlike that ending, it doesn't force you to go back over everything. That film even had a montage sequence showing earlier scenes. In fact, I was sort of disappointed at the loss of an excellent opportunity with the ending Shyamalan chose. It is sort of like Primal Fear, where Richard Gere stumbles outside, dumbfounded. What I think should have been done here was to actually elevate it to the level of a comic book, actually make Mr. Glass a real super villain. It's as if Shyamalan had no clue what to do here. And all I've talked about was the story. Shyamalan more than proves his worth as a director. His style is perhaps even more polished here than it was in The Sixth Sense. I really loved how he did the climactic sequence, especially the scene where David fell into a pool. I hope that he'll stop trying to ape his one hit and move onto more original projects. Lord knows he has the talent. 7/10",Unbreakable

37,KineticSeoul,"Movie that revolves around comic books, but not really a straightforward superhero movie",8,21 March 2012,"I remember first seeing the trailer to this movie while in theater to watch the first ""X-Men"" movie. I thought it was interesting with the trailer showing a man surviving a train crash and being the only survivor. I was a kid when I first saw this movie and was a bit bored with it. I guess it's because I didn't feel it all that thrilling or nothing really superhero like stuff happens. But watching it now, this movie is innovative for it's time and sort of enthralling with the direction it tries to go. This was when M. Night Shyamalan was reaching his peak, with his unfortunate downfall later on. So to put it simply like what Quentin Tarantino the premise is sort of like ""what if Superman didn't know he was Superman?"" well not literally but somewhat like it. No, this isn't really a superhero movie although it has a lot to do with comic books in it. This is more of a character driven movie with the interactions and a bit of psychological aspects in it. It's simply captivating and intriguing from beginning to end, like you get a grasp of what this movie is about few minutes in but you get more as it progresses. The themes of connection, opposite and weakness work really well in this movie. If your looking for a straightforward superhero movie you might be disappointed, but even than you will probably enjoy this movie for what it is. It's sort of a different take on a superhero movie. It's believable and realistic take on a movie with a man with powers since it doesn't give too much away and leaves some things to the audiences imagination. The mysterious aspect of this movie and the intuition and investigation part of it, is another part of this movie that works well. So basically just about everything works in this movie, it might not be one of the greatest movies I see and there could have been something that could have been added to make this movie better. But I guess not showing somethings you want to see can add to the mystery and thus I am giving this movie a 8.8/10",Unbreakable
38,thesar-2,The Bone Bros,8,3 September 2016,"Well, M. Night's streak of one great movie was, in fact, broken following this.I know, I know. People cherish The Sixth Sense and Signs, but this was not only by far M. Night Shyamalan's best work, it was his only really good work. (For the record, I thought The Sixth Sense was alright even when I saw the twist 25 minutes into my first viewing and Signs was so- so at best and made me unintentionally laugh out loud many times.) And I think I am in agreeance with everyone else: beyond The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs, the rest of his ""films"" range from pretty bad to some of the worst ""movies"" ever made.But, I digress. Getting back to the film that I found to have just some minor flaws. And let's get those out of the way so I can get back to praising this.Though it's typical M. Night fashion, the first two acts had some slow- ass scenes. Yes, I understand why – tension, build-up, suspense, whatever, but I found them unnecessary to the rest of the film that flowed very nicely. Also, the film was probably too short for such territory to cover. For example, I would've liked to see a minimum of two more scenes of heroism, the train accident that sets this whole thing in motion wasn't shown (?!) and the ending was abrupt and it would've been nicer to see it than read it. In fact, both the train scene and the finale should've been ""Show don't tell."" I am uncertain if that was a budgetary concern or a choice. I hope not the latter. And finally, why or how the heck did David NOT realize any of these abilities or strengths up to this point? It felt extremely unlikely he wouldn't have ever put two and two together without a frail male pointing it out so late in life.Whew! Getting those out of the way, of all the areas I liked: mood, cinematography, score, acting, drive, tension, dialogue and originality, I loved the premise of the film the most. I remember seeing this when it first came out and 16-years later, my opinion stands: this is definitely one of the most adult ""comic-book"" movies made. (Actually, at the time, I called it thee most adult ""comic-book"" movie made, but since then, there has been some outstanding real-life kinds of comic-book films.)David Dunn doesn't just survive two train wrecks (one in this film and the other not being in the remaining M. Night films,) but he walks away without a scratch on him. In what seems to be a trademark with Dunn, he's dumbfounded by this and goes back to his actual broken home life. Luckily for him, the mysterious ""Mr. Glass"" points out several superhuman aspects of Dunn's life in a series of stalking scenes. Even though Dunn's done with him, he starts to question his own life and purpose. In the movie, Mr. Glass is a huge comic book collector and expert. He's also the opposite of Dunn. He's the Breakable Man, whereas: you just look at him the wrong way and his bones break. He's intrigued to find someone that has everything he wasn't granted at birth. He truly believes comic book legends, namely the ""superhero v archenemy"" genre, mirror real life, or vice versa. And though it's coincidence, at least in this movie's universe, I do LOVE the names: David Dunn and Mr. Glass. Just a side-note there as a comic book fan, myself.Early in M. Night's resume, he couldn't help but put major twists in the closing. Unfortunately, I felt both The Sixth Sense and The Village were ONLY made for the twists, but the two in-between, Unbreakable and Signs, were real movies that happened to have a cherry-on-top in the closing. Of the first four mentioned projects, this was by-far my favorite twist. Upon a second viewing, there were more than enough foretelling of said twist, but that's okay: it was very good beforehand and the ending just made it even better. I know M. Night hasn't done a sequel yet and in 95% of his projects, that's truly a blessing. But this one was always one I wanted a follow- up to. Unfortunately, it's been 16 years and both Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson aren't getting any younger. It would be too much like the far- too-late Indy films all over again, sadly.But, since I can't get my wish, I will continue to enjoy this taunt thriller. The one real gem in M. Night's career.***Final thoughts: By the way, I love the foreshadowing of Sam Jackson in front of an artwork of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. I also see the actor playing Dunn's son went on to star in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. T.V. series. Huh.",Unbreakable
39,FeastMode,my notes,9,24 June 2019,"I absolutely love this movie. i love everything about it. the musical score is amazing and frequently makes the scene. the directing is awesome and so is the story. it has a very untraditional feel. the characters are so interesting. and never have character arcs been so apparent to me in a movie. this is a masterpiece of film-making. so many examples of how to do things right. it just hits me the right way (about 5 viewings)

the two reveals were so awesome, first that he did in fact fake his injury, and the second being that mr. glass caused those disasters. great writing and execution.i love how the three characters main arcs were completed one by one. bruce willis is no longer sad because he's doing what he's supposed to be doing and saved his marriage. his son who no longer feels lost and his belief that his father is really a hero is proven true, literally and figuratively. and mr. glass finally finding his true purpose as the arch enemy to the superhero.this is a superhero movie that does not follow any of the usual tropes we see in that genre. i normally love when something builds up to a big action scene. but this movie's climax was so much more impactful than an action scene. when he is fighting the rapist, i am brought to tears. it's such a perfect climax and a fitting conclusion laced with goose-bump-inducing music",Unbreakable
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Defining the genre before it really existed; a surprisingly powerful picture.,8,21 February 2018,"'Unbreakable (2000)' feels especially apt and refreshing now that the superhero genre has been so over-saturated and has been accused by many as having started to 'run out of steam', but this feature actually arrived at a time when comic-book films were still finding their footing and so the fact that it cleverly subverted and provided a commentary on their tropes and themes is almost genius. The feature is a remarkably entertaining and wonderfully enigmatic one, a thriller that maintains an assured pace and builds a genuine emotional connection to all of its incredibly realistic characters so that we genuinely care about each and every one of them, which means that you're never quite sure exactly where it is going to go. Each movement of the plot feels incredibly natural, though, bolstered by phenomenal performances and an incredible script. The movie's overall effect is an incredibly powerful one. 8/10",Unbreakable
41,bowmanblue,The most subtle superhero movie ever,9,17 January 2020,"It's hard to believe that 'superhero' movies ever existed before Marvel's 'shared universe,' but, before bunches of superpowered heroes flew around New York throwing nukes at alien armies, was 'Unbreakable.' To use modern day terminology, it could be best described as an 'origin movie.'However, instead of this origin movie explaining an existing superhero's beginnings, M. Night Shyamalan (back in the year 2000 when every one of his films was Box Office gold) brings us an original take on a person with extra special powers. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, by all accounts an ordinary man who gets caught up in a train crash which kills everyone on board apart from him. This would be weird enough, but then he's immediately contacted by Elijah Price (the ever-awesome Samuel L Jackson) who claims that David is possessed with the ability never to get hurt by anything.Now, if you're so used to superhero movies where it's wall-to-wall computer-generated action then you're probably not going to enjoy this. It's the very definition of a 'slow burner.' In fact (and I hope that this doesn't come as a 'spoiler') there isn't a single shoot-out, car chase or ensemble cast of superheroes coming to the aid of our protagonist. What you have here is a very 'grounded' take on a person who discovers that they aren't quite as normal as they first thought they were.Samuel L Jackson is always good in whatever he does and whereas Bruce Willis' career is more 'hit and miss,' this is a time when the sheer chemistry between them shines through and both are a joy to watch.I enjoyed it at the time and, in these days of over-the-top Marvel movies, I still think it deserves its place up there with the best superhero movies, even if this is so low key' you may be pressed to put it into that genre.",Unbreakable

If you remove the obviously pretentious (and frustratingly unnecessary) camera movements, then you have a fascinating and original character study that just so happens to feel like a comic book film. It's slow building and dated in some areas but the concepts that M. Night proposes are interesting, especially in the eyes of a 2000 era filmmaker. You know, before the golden age of superhero films.I liked it more than I thought, it's just too bad the other two films in the series didn't hit the highs that Unbreakable did.7.4/10",Unbreakable
43,Cineanalyst,The Super Sixth Sense,7,7 October 2019,"Although ""Unbreakable"" is essentially writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's prior film ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999) remade as a superhero movie, it does integrate the world of comic books into what was an effective formula in the first place. Once again, there's a young boy who believes in something that Bruce Willis is partly oblivious to. Again, that boy cries over the secret in a revelatory moment with a parent. Again, Willis's character has marital problems, and the picture is crammed with pregnant pauses--mostly of Willis looking away wistfully, as though that's his idea of acting in something other than a ""Die Hard"" sequel or retread. This time, however, Willis has the sixth sense--plus, he's unbreakable, and Samuel L. Jackson substitutes in the way of an adviser to the person with supernatural powers. I also like the obligatory (in a Shyamalan movie, that is) twist ending even though it's humorously abrupt, which is incongruent with the otherwise somber treatment and subject matter.Appropriately, Jackson's character invests in comic books instead of the prior picture's psychobabble, too. They inspire him to seek out a real superhero. For the most part, ""Unbreakable"" is filmed in an identical manner of realistic supernaturalism as in ""The Sixth Sense"" and quite apart from Shyamalan's more Hollywood, off-the-assembly-line products that comprise his subsequent oeuvre. But, there are flashes--like the hero's sixth-sense visions of others' misdeeds in the story--of comic-book-like imagery, although this is mostly reserved for the superheroic stuff. ""Unbreakable"" also benefits today as a contrast to the explosion since its release of big-budget and doggedly light and unrealistic action-packed superhero fare from the MCU and elsewhere. In that sense, it comes across as both familiar and refreshing.",Unbreakable
44,g-bodyl,"Quiet, Suspenseful Thriller!",8,18 March 2013,"It's hard to believe, but ten years ago M. Night Shymalan was actually a really good director with a knack of thrilling audiences with Signs, The Sixth Sense, and this movie Unbreakable. I found this movie to be the weaker of the three in part of a unsatisfactory ending but the build up to the third act is great and right on par with the Sixth Sense and Signs.This film is about a security guard who is the only survivor of a train crash. Soon afterwords, he meets this mysterious stranger who happens to be a comic book collector and a big believer of related human traits and events between comic books and reality. After this meeting, no one's lives will be the same again.For a movie like this, they only needed two brand-name actors and they happened to be Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Bruce Willis had a toned-down performance which is quite unlike him but I liked his sense of caution and quietness. Samuel L. Jackson simply reminded me of some of his other roles and that's a good thing because I respect him a lot.Overall, this is a tense thriller especially with the first two-thirds of the movie. The last act is good on paper and was okay executed on screen but I felt it could have been much more. I didn't feel the emotion I felt in the other two films I mentioned. It's a shame that M. Night Shymalan has lost his value over the years, but Unbreakable is one of his good ones. I rate this film 8/10.",Unbreakable

Jackson's performance is certainly the best,it's an extremely unique character that once again is nothing like any character Jackson has ever played,his characters are always usually loud and curse an awful lot,he is best known for those characters and I love him for it,but in this movie he showed that he can be so much more than does characters when he wants,this character was so interesting and strange and Jackson suited him perfectly.Similar to the Sixth Sense,the movie has several very unexpected twists that will mess with your head when you find out but will also make you wonder why you didn't realise this earlier.Unbreakable is a great movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a great drama or mystery.

46,A_Different_Drummer,Unbreakable is .. unforgettable,10,5 November 2013,"Astonishing that anyone would give this less than a 10! In 2000 Hollywood was not completely sure what to make of M. Night Shyamalan so they threw a lot of cash at him and stood back to see what would happen? (They tried the same strategy with AIRBENDER and got a very different result). In this case, the slot machine cranked out coins. Not only a great film but possibly one of the top 100 of all time. The story is iconic, action-packed, mysterious, subtle, interwoven, symbolic -- basically he hit every base but romantic comedy. That, deep within the workings of the script, there was a hint, a soupçon, that comics (er, graphic novels, sorry, my bad) might have a grain of truth, merely added another few million viewers to the already-long lineups, as one fanboy told another told another. Moves along brilliantly, both engages and challenges the viewer. Willis is great (as always -- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF CASTING A MIDDLE AGED BALD GUY IN THIS ROLE? WOW!) and M. Night even managed a good performance from Samuel L.

The Sixth Sense was made this way and I found it very irritating as the story deserved some scope. Also, this film was way better than Sixth Sense and I found the twist to be more wholesome and pleasing.The kid who plays Willis' son looked uncannily like Haley Joel Osment and Samuel L.

This leads him to Elijah Price, a comic book art dealer who proposes an incredible hypothesis that changes David's life.The film has a lethargic pace and a subdued, quiet tone. Just like the main character. I kept waiting for the film to break out of its somnambulistic pace, but that never happens. There are revelations and dramatic moments, but ""Unbreakable"" never breaks out of its contemplative tone.It also never ties up numerous loose ends that were obviously written with the intention of linking characters and plot points. Notes in IMDb report that director M. Knight Shyamalan wrote a much longer script that might have been presented as a trilogy. The ending might as well have included the message ""To be continued..."" The story has supernatural elements, as might be expected for Shyamalan and, in parts, feels like a graphic novel adapted to film.

53,tabuno,A Realistic Superhero Unveiled,8,22 January 2019,"15 July 2006. Instead of Spider-Man (2002) or any of the superhero comicbook versions adapted to the screen, Unbreakable takes its premise from the very nature of the darker, more humanistic components of comic books. In a much more human relational and path of human psychology, Shyamalan puts to good use music, photographic technique that provides a compelling look at a more suprahuman exploration of good and evil. In retrospect, Shyamalan taps into a richer vein of thriller and a deeper quality of the nature of good and evil. He avoids the stereotypical action, in slowly unwraps in various levels the mysterious of sacrifice, father-son relationships, and an immense substance contained in this movie. What originally hampered this movie was Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) that skewed the expectations of this movie. Taken on its own merits, Unbreakable is different but resonant. While the many components could have been touched up a tiny bit' a few scenes edited for clarity, and perhaps focusing on fewer characters for a more in-depth experience, the number of powerful scenes especially with the son are memorable. The suggestive nature of Shyamalan's technique is a credit to his allowance for the audience to assume more the task of explanation and experience of the movie for themselves.

54,ironhorse_iv,"This movie is so good, that it's nearly unbreakable.",7,5 March 2015,"Unbreakable was a very risky movie when it came out. When this film came out in 2000, superhero films weren't as popular as today. Some critics might over look this film at the time, because of that reason. This is why I felt, the movie got an underrated treatment. Even so, the movie isn't really seem as a superhero film. It was billed as a psychological thriller rather than a comic book movie, because the way, the movie deconstructed the genre. It was pretty intense. Directed & written by M. Night Shyamalan, the movie tells the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard who recently survive a horrible train wreck. He is the only survivor of the tragic event, walking away without a single injury, bruise, or scratch. Suffering from mental breakdown from the event, he seems disconnected from his own life, unable to remember very much about his past and unwilling to connect to his wife and child. It wasn't until, he was contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic art dealer who has a congenital bone disease that cause his bones to break easily; that both feel that there must be a connection with their strange illness, and both must find their reasons why, it's happening to them. Without spoiling too much of the movie, the movie is very good at creating suspense. Yes, the movie might be a little slow moving in its pacing, but for the most part, it was very enjoyable. I love the movie explaining themes like good and evil, hero and enemy, strength and vulnerability, thesis and antithesis, and destiny and choice, so much deeper than that it should had. A lot of people might have mixed feelings about the twist turning the end, but I found it to be alright. It builds so much on sequel building, when you find out that there are other 'Unbreakables', out there in the world. I would love to one day, see a movie sequel to this, if they ever made one. Honestly, a sequel to this, might honestly save M. Night Shyamalan's career, after his series of recent box offices bombings. Like the other films from M. Night Shyamalan, there are a lot of elements tropes that you can catch when rewatching like how the movie is shot. The movie has a lot of fluid camera movements. Several camera angles were chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene. I love the use of mirrors and reflective surfaces as shots. You really get the sense of glass, being a theme. My favorite shot is the scene, where the doctor is explaining, how he hasn't got a scratch on him, while the other survivor, slowly bleed to death, across the hall. It's so haunting. The movie has elements of the supernatural, and it doesn't seem a bit cheesy. Like M. Night Shyamalan's previous film, 1999's the Sixth Sense; I love the use of colors and hues style. You really can tell, a lot of work was done to make it stand out, despite its gritty nature. I glad, we don't see Bruce Willis don silly tights and cape. You don't see criminals acting like in a comic book fashion. You don't see any of that, awful things. The movie was made in a realistic unique tone and it kinda work. While the movie is rated PG-13, the psychological horror and cold violence could be a bit unsettling. There were some moments that were a little bit uneasy for me to take in, like the child with the gun, wanting to prove he's invincible or a baby breaking his legs in the uterus is a bit much. That was shocking. The acting in the film is alright for what the concept asked. Samuel L. Jackson being slow-spoken and speaking in exposition, most of the time was kinda disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Bruce Willis being kinda depressed, seem lackluster at times, and somewhat boring as a lead. It gets better, when the self-actualization and self-discovery, kicks in, and the main character become more alive. I nearly forgot that Robin Wright was in the film, so you can tell that I absolutely didn't care about the subplot of David and his wife repairing their relationship. It was pretty forgetful. M. Night Shylamalan also has a cameo in the film, playing the awkwardly looking drug dealer, ever. The writing by Shylamalan for dialogue isn't that great. Most of the time, it felt like spitting long drawn exposition than real talk. The music by James Newton Howard is scored gratifyingly. It's slow, mysterious, haunting and eventually blooms into awesomely heroic. Overall: This origin story was very well-done. Unbreakable offers a wonderful premise, and has an astounding cast to pull it off. I do recommended, watching this film. Are you unbreakable? Then, watch this movie.",Unbreakable

I loved the climax. And here, on similar lines, I liked the climax... the only thing that could be liked more than anything else.Bruce Willis shuns (which can also be seen in Surrogates) the lively air (which suits him best) and spoils it at the beginning itself. But, the thrill factor stays strong, from the time it starts few minutes after the initial credits. Two simultaneous stories approaching each other in the backdrop of mysterious play is what the plot is based on. Samuel Jackson does it quite amazingly, playing a mentally infirm person trying to cajole his newly found find into believing his unthinkable theory. What follows is his ways and most surprisingly the ferocious courses of action he adopts to get in touch with the person he was so hopefully searching for.The initial idea is very strong, but stumbles... that is when we realize the plot is centered on a comic idea. That rubbishes everything. The son-father, husband wife relationships are strongly depicted but they lack cohesion and/or logic. Maybe I am skeptic with that.The twist is light but convincing. I can't check if this is a real story, but a sycophantic 7.8/10 for this venture. It intrigues, but the foundation, when exposed, looks cranky.BOTTOM LINE: Give it a try, for this is something different! Recommended!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

I must give it credit for the crisp cinematography, directing and acting in this film which all contribute to a feeling of an (supposedly) ordinary man being trapped into something much greater. However, the core weakness of this film is its reliance on two big plot twists - that the protagonist has real superpowers and that Elijah Glass caused the Eastrail 177 train crash. Both of these are predictable from their first interaction, with or without knowing Shyamalan's penchant for surprise endings. This reduces the entire film to a brooding and plodding wait for characters to find out what was already obvious. The moments along the way flesh out their characters and abilities for sure, but without anything to redeem the pacing until nearly the end, the viewing experience devolves into a repetitive slog of unfruitful interactions.",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan, movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and even ""Lady in the Water"" (provided you view it with the right perspective) can be enjoyed again and again. ""Unbreakable"" is a little different in that it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. However, the first viewing will still provide a mind-bending experience worthy of M. Night.For a basic plot summary, ""Unbreakable"" focuses on David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who walks away from a horrible train wreck as the only survivor...and without a scratch on him. After meeting with eccentric comic book dealer ""Mr. Glass"" (Samuel L. Jackson), David begins to question whether or not that train wreck survival was a ""miracle"" at all. When he discovers that he has never been sick that he can remember and that he possess certain prognosticative powers, he begins to wonder just who (or what) exactly he might be.This film is typical M. Night fare in that it weaves a great mystery and gets you thinking all the way through. It isn't a ""sit back and pop the popcorn"" kind of flick. Instead, it thrives on the viewer using some mental effort and getting caught up in the seemingly impossible tale of David Dunn and Mr. Glass. As such, it might be a bit slow for some viewers, but if you like any of M. Night's other works (or even those type of movies) you'll have no trouble here.About the only bad thing I have to say about this film is that it is only truly remarkable on the first viewing. After that (unless you have a short memory!) it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. The reason? This one is ALL about the mystery, lacking the strong auxiliary characters like ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"".Overall, ""Unbreakable"" is a fine film that showcases the M. Night mysterious style of film- making. If you are in the mood for a great mind-bending mystery and haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat.",Unbreakable

Elijah has an unsettling theory about David's miraculous escape from the train wreck, and a curious friendship develops.Back into his early career, Shyamalan has shown himself to be an outstanding master of atmosphere and a riveting storyteller. Unbreakable holds the attention from its first moments, an opening sequence with Bruce Willis on the train, the restlessness of the camera implying a sense of foreboding. However, the ending is less than great which is what brings the film as a whole to be less greater than what it should have been.",Unbreakable

His directorial approach is definitely deft, and UNBREAKABLE puts the ""human"" in superhuman in a decidedly dramatic fashion. Bruce Willis soars to new heights as the urban uberman. The story unfolds logically, the overall plan glimpsed here and there in tantalizing bits and pieces, as with any good mystery. And the questions at the heart of this particular mystery are answered satisfactorally along the way. Shyamalan never misses a beat. Only someone incapable of appreciating good drama (or superior filmmaking) could be disappointed.",Unbreakable
62,johnnyboyz,Very well done film about self-discovery and remarkably; works as a superhero film as well.,7,27 February 2008,"About three quarters of the way into Unbreakable, I was thinking of some very high praise indeed of director M Night Shyamalan; I was thinking that this film that he has made here is probably what 2000s X-Men would've looked like had Stanley Kubrick still been alive and had he been obscure enough to take on such a project. High praise, indeed. Oddly enough, X-Men came out in the same calendar year as Unbreakable but sadly, that is where the similarities end.So if Unbreakable is Kubrick crossed with X-Men, it should be an up in the air, some good-some bad, topsy-turvy picture about characters who have problems whilst at the same, maintaining a strong visual and aesthetical sense when dealing with themes and notions  erm; well Unbreakable does have an impressive cast and it does slowly, in an eerie and mythical sort of a way, build up to a point where it explodes in a bout of emotion as a certain character suffers an epiphany that lasts a few scenes; but apart from those things, Unbreakable is a steady if not unspectacular ride through the actual psyche of a superhero. Unbreakable was made at a time when super hero films were not really of a common nature: Batman had been and then been respectively killed off; Superman had enjoyed some success but had died a death following a lacklustre 80s sequel or two and most other superheroes like Flash Gordon or Supergirl were given nothing more than camp live action cartoons for films.But then you have Unbreakable, a film that has its idea as: What if you were a superhero, you just didn't know it yet? David Dunn (Willis) plays everyday man-come-superhero who is stronger and more aware than he thinks; using telekinetic powers and the ability to predict things before they have a realistic chance of happening. Then you have Elijah Price (Jackson), the fittingly named Mr. Glass as his bones are so weak, he so much as even sneezes violently, he could do himself some serious damage. There are two things that play on the audience's minds from this: the first is Dunn's moody and depressed attitude he has but also his mysteriousness that he carries, especially after surviving a train wreck in the first scene. The second is the vulnerability to Price; a man who would be willing to chase a man down a flight of subway stairs if it meant putting himself at great risk, but proving to himself at least, that he was correct in assuming something. This is where we wince and cringe as Price puts himself at risk for various items of information; an impressive thing to be able to do in a film.Close attention has also been paid to the way the film looks and the way it has been shot; I think Shyamalan has, in all of his films regardless of overall quality, shot and produced wonderful cinematography to capture the mood and feel of the film; be it of the depressing, dreamlike or fairytale variety. Here, the long takes and bleak cinematography compliment the camera work which is vast in its moving around and tracking as it focuses on its subjects. The camera-work retains a certain point of view feeling; there the very first scene to talk about in which we see Dunn and a random woman talk on the train; we see it from through the gap in the seats in front, retaining a child-like quality for the composition since I feel it's the sort of thing a child may do when fed up and sitting on a train; this echo's Shyamalan's later film Lady in the Water which itself was a child-like fable. But, there is also sweeping camera over the roof of Dunn's car as he finds the note from Price; again, this was a sort of point of view composition as the director utilises reflections and patterns on screen.I think Unbreakable is a fascinating film for other reasons, though. I think it's quite funny how, nearer the beginning, Price tries to talk to Willis' character about how he could well be this hard-bodied superhero and Willis plays him down. This is, of course, Willis going against what he had been doing practically his whole career up to this point: playing the hard-bodied action guy but now he is denying that he has any kind of those characteristics; interesting to read further into it, is that Willis played a clam and more sedate character in Shyamalan's previous film The Sixth Sense. However, while the look of the film is impressive and the camera work long, slow and deliberate; Price seems to be convinced a little too easily that Dunn is his man since there are more disasters that happen in the world that Price would lead us onto believe; does the man Price is looking for have to be American? There is also the segment that focuses on Dunn trying to re-fall in love with his estranged wife that seems a little out of place in a film all about finding ones identity within.But while the climax and the denouement would have Dunn rather obviously facing his fears whilst systematically coming to terms with whom or what he is, some may complain it is too short and sudden to be entertaining and too incidental to feel original. While these are small complaints, Unbreakable remains a strong and teasing picture about self-discovery; about what it's like to find yourself and about what it's like to help people; to stand up and be responsible when you discover you are able to be. Shyamalan may not have made a masterpiece but he has made a film that is interesting and unpredictable for the best part while making us want more after it has finished.",Unbreakable
63,filipemanuelneto,When an end saves the film...,7,22 August 2015,"The film tells the story of David Dunn, a security of an American football stadium with marital problems, and their relationship with Elijah Price, an African-American with a terrible and rare disease that makes his bones so brittle as glass. David, thanks to Elijah, discovers a series of superhuman powers that will change his own life.Directed by Night Shyamalan, this film features Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in the lead roles and was the second movie where Willis worked with this director (the first was ""The Sixth Sense""). Both actors played their roles very well, with Willis perfectly embodying the emotional and psychological conflicts of his character. Although the actors deserves congratulations, the most remarkable in this film is the script's central idea: a true homage to the world of comics, the film focuses his action in these magazines and their heroes and villains, which we can glimpse mirrored in the main characters, as well on several references and allusions that arise discreetly: some camera angles, the Dunn raincoat at the end of the film etc.Unfortunately, there are also some less good aspects that results, mainly, from situations not totally understood, which may indicate that there were some mistakes in script's writing. In fact, it almost seems to us that the writer has devoted most of his attention to the end of the film, only (we will talk about that later). The first, and perhaps the most obvious error is the Elijah glass stick. It's simply incomprehensible that someone so ill uses a cane as fragile as their own bones. And how Elijah could meet Dunn's car to put his card on the windshield if both still didn't know each other? The origin of Dunn's powers is also incomprehensible, unlike Elijah condition, which is caused by a disease. Another flaw is the final fight, where David commits murder, something that a superhero simply don't do (and remember, the movie tries to embody in Dunn's character the qualities of a superhero). In the comics, the ""bad guys"" are defeated and handed over to the authorities or die as a result of his own wickedness. When David Dunn kills with his own hands he are closest to a ""vigilante"" than a hero, no matter the good intentions.Despite these negative notes, ""Unbreakable"" is a film that does what it sets out to do and entertains the audience very well, mainly due to the central idea of ​​the plot, the excellent performance of the actors and the end of the story that is totally unexpected. Without the final twist of the story, this movie probably would have been a disappointment, a brilliant idea for a movie that would have ended badly used.

65,TheMovieDiorama,Unbreakable proves you do not need flashy effects to produce a compelling superhero story.,8,28 February 2018,"Shyamalan has had a rough career, with most (including myself) believing he has progressively got worse as a director. He has somewhat got back on track with newer releases but there is no denying that his earlier work was masterful. Unbreakable follows David Dunn, an average father and security guard, who miraculously survived the derailing of a train. Soon after a confrontation with a mysterious individual makes him question whether or not he might have special abilities. What is genius about this story is how intelligent and mature it is. It's not just ""oh, I'm invincible...I'm going to save the world!"". No no no, it's much more grounded than that. The majority of the plot is an origin story, David discovering his ability and investigating past accidents that he was in. We as the audience are mystified, much like David, so anything that he unravels is as much a revelation to us as it is to him. I really admired that approach, it made the story utterly compelling. It raises the question that if you did have such abilities, should you utilise them for the greater good? It deconstructs every motive that your typical superhero has and adds more human characteristics. Shyamalan was great at directing this thriller (let's face it, it's his genre of expertise) with plenty of inventive camera shots, particularly a scene involving some curtains blowing in the wind as we look into the room. Samuel L Jackson was fantastic and added some sympathetic depth towards his character. Bruce Willis was good although struggled with the more emotionally involved scenes. The child actor...sorry but no, wasn't good. The famous Shyamalan plot ""twist"" was something I should've predicted, but dammit I fell for it again! Brilliantly executed. A shame that the ending was too abrupt in my opinion. Also David's poor family life really did not affect him as a character.

The two main characters are interesting and would be best left alone, but the director seems to think he knows what he is doing (which eventually gives the public Split and Glass).The later two movies, which suck, show a lack of understanding of character development. They lack a purpose. They end up being movies not teaching the viewer a lesson. They are more symbolic about the director's personal conflict inside himself rather than humanity. The moral is lost because it is encrypted so deeply in the script that it becomes lost to the viewer.Story telling is only good when you can teach a lesson to the viewer.

69,Anonymous_Maxine,Excellent follow up to The Sixth Sense.,8,5 May 2009,"I remember being unimpressed with Unbreakable when it was first released, I think mostly because they had the bizarre idea of casting Samuel L. Jackson, the Badass Motherf#%ker himself, as a man whose bones break so easily that he can hardly leave the house. The Sixth Sense is a hell of a debut film to follow up, but in retrospect I would argue that M. Night Shyamalan did a great job of it with Unbreakable. The movie has received mixed responses from critics and the public alike, but it is inarguably an interesting experience as an example of a young writer and director carving a spot for himself in the film-making world while running with the big dogs. Comic book aficionados are likely to find a lot of fascinating material to chew on in Unbreakable, although I also enjoyed the film immensely despite a total lack of interest in comic books. Shyamalan takes a certain aspect of the potential historical meaning and significance of comic book mythology and crafts it into a superhero thriller that is entirely his own, which is no small achievement. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis play Elijah Price and David Dunn, respectively. We meet David soon after a spectacular train crash that leaves every single passenger dead and himself without a scratch, and we meet Elijah minutes after his birth, the trauma of which broke both of his delicate arms and legs. Elijah grows up to be high-class salesman of rare and priceless comic book art, the results of a childhood limited to the safety of his room and his comic collection, while David grows up to be a security guard at a sports stadium. Elijah discovers David as a result of his surviving the train crash, and he becomes convinced that David's strength is the exact antithesis of his own weakness, and that this ""power"" connects them. The movie explores Elijah's efforts to convince David of his theory and David's gradual understanding of what exactly that theory means. Given the supernatural nature of it, he becomes less and less impressed with Elijah's persistence. The movie is a fascinating ride and tells a compelling story despite being peppered with the same kind of plot holes that plagued The Sixth Sense, although here I seemed less willing to accept them. David never noticed, for example, the fact that he has never been sick or even mildly injured in all of his life until Elijah pointed it out to him. For someone with a career in high school football that ended as a result of an injury that he was forced to fake, this seems like more than a little bit of a stretch.Shyamalan comes through on the public expectation of a good twist at the end of his movies, and while the twist in this one isn't as brilliant as that in The Sixth Sense, it's still unexpected and leaps and bounds beyond the laughable twist at the end of The Village. The moody tone and photography is characteristic of Shyamalan's work, as is Willis' subdued performance. There are times when the film's score picks up with nothing really carrying it, but the movie has a solid story and sure-handed direction that ensures that even the most judicious of us can let go and enjoy the ride. It's not his best work (that's probably still The Sixth Sense), but clearly Shyamalan's first three films were his best work so far, and after three increasingly disappointing films in a row, I hope he goes back to the kinds of stories that he tells best before he ends up going straight to DVD. After Lady in the Water and The Happening, he's not far off",Unbreakable
70,southdavid,Purple Rain,7,7 January 2019,"In preparation for the upcoming ""Glass"" I decided to rewatch ""Unbreakable"" to remind me of the early adventures of David Dunn.Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is lone survivor of a train derailment who inexplicably doesn't have a scratch on him. The reporting of the event brings him to the attention of Elijah Price (Sam Jackson) a man with hyper brittle bones caused by Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Inspired by seeing the opposite of his fragile body, and by a life of reading comic books, Elijah attempts to investigate and then convince Dunn that he is a hero and should be using his gifts.Firstly, I was stuck on how much of ""Unbreakable"" I remembered, despite it being a few years since I last saw it. Back when M Night Shyamalan could do no wrong, his trademark twist in this one seems obvious, even overplayed, once you know it. Though I do remember, whilst not on a ""Sixth Sense"" level, this was a pretty solid twist the first time I saw it. Though Shyamalan's twists became his ""trademark"", eventually to his detriment, there are a lot of other key traits of his in ""Unbreakable"" that remain there to be admired. Shot framing and particularly camera movement are excellent. The longs takes and limited cutting also are striking, with occasionally deciding to keep the character on one person in a conversation, and look at their reactions, rather than drifting backwards and forwards. The colour palette usage is also nicely done.""Unbreakable"" feels very much like what it was apparently originally envisioned to be. It's the first third of a superhero film (the character establishing section) stretch out to a full length feature. As a result it does feel a bit of an unusual film. There isn't many of the beats you would expect, it's mostly Dunn putting his family back together and coming to accept who he is (or who he might be). The films climax comes from catching a murderer who is not mentioned prior to the previous scene this occurs in. A more traditional film might have built that character more across the runtime, before having Dunn oppose him, but ""Unbreakable"" is more interested in the relationship between Dunn and Price.I'm not sure that the pacing would allow the film to stand up to too many repeated viewings, but as a film seen once every so often it very much stands up - and I'm looking forward to a proper return for Dunn and Price in ""Glass"".",Unbreakable

74,elshikh4,Breakable !,4,12 February 2010,"At the time, me and my friend were crazy movie buffs, who used to discuss movies all the time non-stop. He watched (Unbreakable) first when it was released in 2000. And when we met days after it, in the funeral of his grandmother, he told me: ""Without the end's twist, this is worthless!"". Then, after 5 years, I watched it, to say: ""This is not worthless. It's just disappointing"".Artistically, it got many good points. M. Night Shyamalan does know his tools pretty well, so he entertained us with perfectly exquisite shots, and real special atmosphere. But there were other, more deep, matters to bother.For one, how David, the lead character, doesn't know that he lived a whole life sick-less?!! I deemed the scene, where he was asking about any vacations that he had before, a joke! Or how he forgot totally about the swimming pool's accident which was about to kill him, to a degree that made him a myth for years later?? I think that the lead that we watched wasn't a senile old man who forgets THAT BAD, or someone who suffers amnesia!Then, the character of Elijah. On a simple level, it outwardly had excessively special features (bizarre haircut, strange raincoats, a 50s car,..) while that fits him as an odd man, they - in the same time - sort of conflicted with the fact that he did all of these crimes, since according to these very features, he was that easily traceable. However, what really provoked me was relating a ""glass cane"" to him. It was impossible, rather so silly, that a fragile person like him leans on a ""glassy"" cane!On a profound level, the motive of Elijah wasn't believable. I thought he would search for his opposite, to be his friend, or to have a serum from his blood to cure his rare illness, or anything that may sound more logical and less weak.I hated how the powers of David were many; he sees through clothes, knows people's life by touching them, bulletproof body, super muscles.. etc. And I hated more that ""borrowing"" from Stephen King's (The Dead Zone). Why to destroy the originality of your work by your own hands Mr. Shyamalan?!!For some reason, I didn't like the sequence of the first mission; which centered on saving the kids from a deranged killer. I thought that's another movie.Samuel L. Jackson did a good job, but Willis wasn't that completely convincing. I mean yeah, the man used his radiant charisma so fine, and Shyamalan's camera did a watchable effort with his face, however I clearly refer to his performance at the last scene; that dear Bruce.. was a fake! I don't know why, but I believe that big part in Willis, the actor, stopped caring much, or caring, since long time ago, being, in most cases, just an image of cold-hearted or senseless charismatic star!A lot of viewers, such as my friend, banned the movie for being just less interesting or surprising than Shyamalan and Willis's previous, surely more profitable, movie (The Sixth Sense). While I'm aware that not all the movies need to be another (The Sixth Sense), I though (Unbreakable) was less original, having important points done weakly, and most of all, missing a substance, or a human message. It's attractively polished glass, but still a glass.. a breakable one too.",Unbreakable

77,freemantle_uk,When Shyamalan was good,8,7 August 2010,"It is fair to say that M. Night Shyamalan has been going down hill for a long time. Non of his films has matched The Sixth Scene's quality and slowly his writing has become worst. He has made 3 flops in a row, Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender. But after making The Sixth Sense he had the world as his feet, he was touted as a potential director for Harry Potter and he was allow to make his dream project, Unbreakable.David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a Philadelphia security guy and when returning from a job interview was in a horrific train clash. He was the only survive and even more miraculous David was unharmed. David ends up being very confused by why he survived and added to mix is his dissolving marriage with Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and strain relationship with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). A comic book collector Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), suffering from osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bone disease) believes that David is a real life superhero and that comic-book as a visual median were originally based on real people and just manipulated over time. Elijah tires to convince David that there is something more to his life and try and become a real life superhero despite David's scepticism.As stated Shyamalan had a lot of good will behind him after The Sixth Sense, which allowed him to make this project. With Unbreakable he was able to create a good supernatural thriller in the real world; this is not your traditional superhero film. It was shot very much like The Sixth Sense, with Shyamalan skillful using a lot of single shots, long takes with the camera moving during the scene and adding to the intense, tight feeling of Unbreakable. It was dark, moody and slowly building up throughout the film. There are excellent scene like when Joseph points a gun at David to prove that he had supernatural powers. This is a film trying to set the idea of a real-life superhero, this is not like Spider-man where he gets new powers and practices and makes a costume or Batman where he has to train himself and have a range of gadgets or X-Men where the world is filled with people with powers. David has to slowly discovery the secret about himself and give himself a purpose in live. There was able a good amount of comic book reference and talk throughout the film and of course there is a lot of iconography in comic book art, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to think someone would believe that comic books are based on real people. Shyamalan only shows one fight scene but it was a well constructed scene, with the camera up in the corner of the room and just keeps it there. It was a well executed scene. The dialogue was strong and Unbreakable has a very interesting plot and idea. But there are some plot inconsistencies which affect the film, like how David starts to develop his instinct powers.Willis and Jackson have worked together before in Pulp Fiction (even though didn't have a scene together) and Die Hard with Vengeance, and again there have excellent chemistry. I personally believe that Willis is a very talented actor, the best out of all the action stars of his era and with Unbreakable he gives a very powerful performance. He play the role with real conviction and was real in his performance. Jackson is one of the coolest actors around and too was a good as Elijah, but there were the occasional moment of over acting, like when he shoots at a customer. But of course when Jackson is on form he is amazing. I can see that Shyamlan was trying to find another Haley Joel Osment when he cast Clark, but he was not quite as good as Osment was in the Sixth Sense. Wright Penn was also good throughout the film and show she is a talented actress as a woman trying to keep her marriage going.I love the idea of trying to make a more realistic superhero film and Shyamalan was able to a make a good thriller. It's a shame that he is one a mission to destroy his own career because he can direct some really good set piece and he needs to make more smaller thrillers.",Unbreakable

I have yet to find the words that I think best describes this utterly repulsive, smirking, self-loving, little air-head.

So, with almost half of this dumb Supernatural/Thriller's expenses going to paying these 2 insufferable jerks off, it's certainly no wonder that Unbreakable's demented, little story came across as being nothing more than a pile of slapdash, insincere and laughable excrement.I mean, if the viewer is really so naively gullible as to take Elijah Price's (Mr. Breakable) glib, little spiel about (get this!) comic books being the last link to the ""ancient way"" (huh!?), then they so rightly deserve to have the remainder of this drab, cliché-riddled story rammed right down their throat at warp speed, no less.Using oodles of hauntingly-hypnotic, background music as a slimy ruse to deceive the viewer into thinking that what they are witnessing on screen is, in reality, a story verging on the very edge of being a supremely metaphysical phenomenon, Breakable arrogantly pushes the limits of its incoherency to the max as it promptly pulls the viewer down to the level of its own stupidity, in no time flat.",Unbreakable

Why am I writing this review about the new film from  the director of The Sixth Sense with Nat King Cole in my system? Is it that I am going crazy or maybe I am seeing dead singers? Back to reality: The film is about a security guard who comes out unscratched from a serious train wreck. He then meets a very strange character in order to obtain the answers from this mysterious happening. Stars Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver notable performances, and once again demonstrate that it is no pulp fiction that they work well together with a vengeance. The only aspect that I would put some krazy glue on to `Unbreakable' was the role of Robin Wright Penn in the film. Her role was written a little bit too underdeveloped. Director Shyamalan strength is the surprise endings he inserts in his films, and you should sense that it is no different with `Unbreakable.' Come and break the ice! Call someone and go see `Unbreakable.' **** Good",Unbreakable
81,mjneu59,the moody style effectively camouflages some pretty thin material,6,12 January 2011,"The director and star of the supernatural blockbuster 'The Sixth Sense' reunite to see if box office lightning will strike twice: hardly likely, given the astronomical numbers posted by the earlier film. This time around Bruce Willis is again the odd man out, the only survivor of a fatal train crash who begins to suspect he owes his life to something more than mere serendipity. Is he an accidental plaything of fate, or (believe it or not) an unsuspecting comic book superhero down on his luck? A little more ambiguity might have added some necessary tension to the far-fetched scenario, but from the first frame the issue is hardly in doubt, and as a result the obligatory surprise ending (around which the entire film revolves) is unfairly deflated, trading the compelling supernatural hook of its predecessor for an intriguing but esoteric Twilight Zone plot twist demanding a more laborious suspension of disbelief.Writer director M. Night Shyamalan maintains the same somber, self-conscious style that so effectively marked his earlier film, with long meaningful pauses separating every portentous line of dialogue, and a deliberate editing scheme favoring suspense over easy shock tactics. It's refreshing to find a moviemaker not enslaved to Hollywood's current hyper-kinetic visual fads, but it's also safe to say the pacing flags at more than one point: Rod Serling could have told the same story just as well in less than 30 minutes. An economic, two-character cast (Willis, plus Samuel Jackson as his crackpot guide to reluctant enlightenment) makes the whole thing look not unlike a student screen writing exercise, pulled out of Shyamalan's old college trunk and hastily dusted off to help keep his suddenly hot career from losing any momentum.",Unbreakable
82,alindsay-al,A Great film that was ahead of its time,8,17 January 2019,"With Glass coming out tomorrow I have gone back and watched the film that started this universe Unbreakable. This film is incredibly unique as it focuses on comic books before the genre of comic book films was a big deal. The premise of the film sees a man survive a train crash unscathed, which peaks the interest of an excentric art dealer. Bruce Willis is the lead in this film and he does a really good job, he is very sombre and down in the dumps in this film but he sells his character very well. You are rooting for him in this film and it is really interesting seeing his character developing and going on a great journey. Samuel L Jackson plays his partner in this film and does such a great job, he isn't as over the top as he has been in other films but he is excentric enough to sell his character as a unique character and you are supporting his role aswell. I also thought the roles of Willis's family were portrayed very well to add to the drama in the film. The story in the film is fantastic seeing this origin story of this normal man realising that maybe he could be a superhero. It is portrayed well enough to make it seem pretty realistic and feasable even though it has supernatural elements. However, i felt like this film ends abruptly, there is a great twist, but it just ends afterwards and I was disappointed by that. The script is great with great dramatic dialogue and well placed humour that helps build up this universe. The style of the film has a great tone to it, the dark mood and incredible score really takes you to this universe. Though i cannot deny that this film has a really slow pacing about it which does hurt its overall quality in my opinion. Overall this is a great film that was quite revolutionary when it came back and should be seen especially given the state of comic book films in this day and age.",Unbreakable
83,Chris_Docker,A slow attempt at formula,5,8 January 2001,"The fact that this film is reasonably well-made stops me calling it pretentious rubbish, but really all we have is a director who had a major hit (Sixth Sense) trying to turn that into a formula. The result is a movie that is slow, tedious, and rather full of its own importance. The acting is great. Willis plays a man who is the only survivor of an accident and seemingly has had little or nothing wrong with him all his life. Against his better judgment, he starts to believe that there may be something rather special about him, that comic heroes are based on a spark of truth and that maybe he embodies it. The surprise at the end is quite good but hardly worth the wait.",Unbreakable
84,MaxBorg89,Shyamalan's masterpiece,10,16 June 2008,"You're a young director, and you have just hit it big with an intelligent thriller called The Sixth Sense. What's your next move? An intelligent... comic-book movie? For many other filmmakers, such a gamble could have marked the end of their career; in the case of M. Night Shyamalan, it became the best film he's made to this point.Following the old ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" rule, Shyamalan teams up with Bruce Willis again, and for the second consecutive time Willis plays a more subdued role compared to his signature films (no ""yippee-ki-yay"" moments here). His character is a security guard named David Dunn. He's an ordinary man who used to play football in high school but had to quit because of an injury. One day, he is on a train that accidentally derails, resulting in the death of all passengers but him. On top of being the only survivor, he doesn't have a single scratch on his body. No one is able to explain that, and David tries to get back to a normal life, until he runs into a wheelchair-bound comic-book fan, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), also known as Mr. Glass since he suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta, a disease that makes his bones much more fragile than those of a normal human being. Elijah is convinced David is some kind of superhero, and sets out to prove it by asking a series of questions, the most important of which is: ""How many days of your life have you been sick?"".Unbreakable does the impossible of turning a potentially geeky subject into a serious movie - with a limited budget. There are no special effects or overly weird events, meaning all Shyamalan has to tell his story is a suitable mood, James Newton Howard's music and the priceless Willis-Jackson double act. Jackson, in particular, is a bit of a revelation in a part that's miles away form his signature cool performances à la Pulp Fiction: he's brooding, intense and occasionally scary - just what's needed to make the film work. Willis, on the other hand, succeeds in conveying the humanity of a character who might not even be human.Sure, the film is low-key and a bit slow at times, something most viewers might not like in this kind of film. Those who liked The Sixth Sense, though, will be happy to know that the director has topped himself, and the slow pace is worth putting up with in light of the epilogue, which is Unbreakable's very reason to exist. To all viewers who claimed the twist in The Sixth Sense was obvious: you won't see this one coming. Exceptional 9,5/10",Unbreakable
85,Fluke_Skywalker,Small scale saves the day,7,25 April 2017,"Plot; A man survives a train accident unharmed, catching the attention of a mysterious art gallery owner with an obsession for comic books.As with many of Shyamalan's movies, there are moments in Unbreakable where it doesn't pay to think too hard about its logic if you want to enjoy the film to its fullest. If that sounds like a cop out, well, maybe it is. But with entertainment there's often a reward for such forgiveness, and that certainly applies here.Some dubious logic aside, Unbreakable is an exceptionally well made, well acted slow burn of a film. It is, for all intents and purposes, a comic book movie, but it lacks the CGI spectacle and mass destruction now so closely associated with the genre. That sort of thing can and has been done well (Avengers, Winter Soldier), but it's starting to become so much white noise, making this pre comic book movie renaissance entry feel refreshing.",Unbreakable

Jackson was surprisingly amazing and for me he was the best of all. Robin Wright looked little off track and could've utilised much better. Spencer was just amazing.Screenplay as mentioned earlier is gripping and just like other Shyamalan movies doesn't has much twists, he always keeps the big twists for the end, the movie gets slow in the middle but never gest off from the track.The climax as mentioned earlier many times has a surprising twist, after Sixth Sense this is my second most favorite movie directed by Manoj N.

Because of this, I could hardly see the characters' faces at times, especially Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson). When he fell down the stairs at the train station, I got really scared. This was because he was severely injured. Now, I am about to tell you what my favorite part of the movie was, so please, don't say I have a twisted sense of movie enjoyment. That's just the way I am. Okay, here it goes. My favorite part was when Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) and David (Bruce Willis) were having an argument in the kitchen at their home. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say two things. First, the entire cast did a good job. Second, as far as I could see, the lighting was the only problem with the film. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson, I recommend this film.",Unbreakable

So we knew Bruce Willis (The Overseer) was the hero, so who was the villain? The whole movie I was think that Mr. Glass is the only candidate for being a supervillain, since the hero is unbreakable and Mr. Glass is so weak and fragile, I thought it was a logical for him to be villain. So the whole movie I was waiting for Mr. Glass to show up as the villain, and the whole movie came to the end, the story ended and I have lost all my hopes of him being evil. I though, well, this movie doesn't have a main villain, it's interesting. And then the most obvious, predictable plot twist happened. I was shocked, I was so mindblown.

90,ferbs54,Deliberately Paced But Fascinating,8,26 April 2017,"Only got to see one film over the weekend, but it was a most enjoyable one. The movie was ""Unbreakable,"" which I had wanted to see ever since it was released in 2000. Many of my coworkers were raving about it back when, but it took me almost 17 years to catch up with it. It is the M. Night Shyamalan film that immediately follows ""The Sixth Sense,"" which up until last night, was the only M. Night movie that I had ever seen. In this one, Bruce Willis stars again, this time as David Dunn, a football-stadium security guard who is the sole survivor of a horrific train accident. He soon comes to realize that he has never been injured in his entire life...or had a single sick day! Oddball comic-art gallery owner Samuel L. Jackson tries to convince him that he is special, while Bruce's estranged wife, Robin Wright Penn, looks on in confusion. Ultimately, the viewer realizes that he/she is watching nothing less than a genuine superhero movie, albeit a very realistic one. Dunn's superpowers turn out to be unusual strength and the ability to sense the evil deeds of anyone he comes in contact with. He tackles a psycho home invader in a very tense finale, but M. Night has one more twist ending up his sleeve, as he had in ""The Sixth Sense."" The film is a deliberately paced, quiet affair, but a fascinating one, nevertheless. Quentin Tarantino has gone on record as saying that he feels that Bruce gave his career-best performance here, and he really is very fine and understated in this one. I have heard that the character that Bruce plays here makes a belated return in this year's Shyamalan film ""Split,"" and I do hope to catch that one now at some future point. ""Unbreakable"" comes very highly recommended by yours truly. I have one more film by the man on tap, and that one is 2004's ""The Village,"" which seems to suffer with very mixed reviews. Stay tuned....",Unbreakable
91,Enchorde,"Spectacular story, great details, exceptional movie",9,19 October 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **David Dunn (Willis) is involved in a train accident. Everyone (in his car) is killed but Dunn, who survives totally unharmed. After being released by the hospital and attending the memorial service he is approached by Elijah Price (Jackson). Price is born with a genetic disease that make his bones extremely fragile, which has lead to numerous breaks and hospital visits. Price wants to know if Dunn has ever been sick. Dunn is perplexed, neither he, or his wife Audrey (Wright Penn), the other part of his failing marriage, has any recollection of Dunn ever being sick. Price has a theory, that if he is so fragile, somewhere out there is someone who is unbreakable, a sort of hero. Like the comic superheroes who are much of Price's life. David and Audrey think he is crazy, but Price is persistent, and then there are some curious facts that undoubtedly points in the direction of Price's theory.This is a great movie. In the bottom, as the base of the movie, is a great story. Shyamalan, who has written and directed, has made a very good job indeed with the story. It has no flaws and is full of details that Shyamalan brings forward by using cinematic tricks and strategies. In addition the cast is very good. Willis and Jackson are giving a great performance, and so are Wright Penn and Clark (as David and Audrey's son Joseph). There is no flaw anywhere. As mentioned, full of details, the story slowly evolves not really giving much clues in which direction it is about to take of, which gives the audience lots of time to guess and think about events. In this way, a kind of suspense is built up. At the same time it is enjoying just watching the effort everybody puts in into the movie. And then one never knows where Shyamalan takes the story...

Samuel L Jackson plays a unique villain that only Samuel L Jackson could play. Although the climax wasn't as shocking as Bruce Willis being a ghost in the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable stands in a class all its own.

While the story as a whole was intriguing, the pacing was so horrible that I felt like yelling at the screen `move around a little!' While the lack of editing has never bothered me before, this slow nature of the film and the drawn out scenes kept me from giving this film a higher grade. Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis gave great performances, making the bi-polar nature of their friendship feel real.

94,ShootingShark,Intriguing Fable Of Everyman Gradually Discovering He May Not Be What He Seems,6,4 July 2009,"David Dunn is the sole survivor of a horrific train crash in Philadelphia. He is contacted by Elijah Price, a comics collector, who thinks David may be some kind of superhuman figure. At first, David dismisses Elijah as a crackpot, but slowly the evidence starts to build that Elijah may be right This is the world's most unusual superhero movie (the only other contender being The Return Of Captain Invincible), with no action, no heroics, no costumes, no romance and an almost constant downbeat tone. It takes an absurd idea - that an Ordinary Joe wakes up one day and realises that he's indestructible - and presents it as poignant character drama. The story is very slight, but it's a typically courageous, interesting and offbeat one from the gifted Shyamalan. His task is to gently convince us that David is a comic-book hero and he and Willis succeed through clever storytelling, subtle performances and unhurried, engrossing film-making. The photography is first-rate throughout. It was shot by Eduardo Serra (Map Of The Human Heart, Girl With A Pearl Earring), the talented Portuguese cameraman who has made films everywhere, and he fills it with beautiful wide canvases, unsettling overheads and a terrific little upside-down motif that runs right through it. In this kind of a movie, it's more how the story is told than the story itself which makes the difference, and both the camera-work and James Newton Howard's soft score combine to beguile us into the mystery. Willis and Jackson are both excellent (and couldn't be more different from their previous teaming on Die Hard: With A Vengeance) and the support cast is good, with Shyamalan appearing in his regular small role as the guy Willis gives a shakedown at the stadium. This is perhaps not up there with Shyamalan's best (The Sixth Sense, The Village), perhaps because of its intentionally muted and simple storyline, but is still a terrific and highly original thriller/fantasy film.",Unbreakable

98,Spleen,Unbreakable,8,13 July 2001,"At first you get the impression that the artistic success of ""The Sixth Sense"" has gone to Shyamalan's head - for the first quarter-hour or more every other shot is pointlessly arty.  The scene on the train is terribly done: camera peering through a gap in the seats, shifting from side to side because it can't get a good view.  Then there's that moment when Elijah is given his first comic, and the camera moves overhead until it is shooting directly down, then swivels 540 degrees in a comic-synchronous position. The very first scene is shot through a mirror for no reason at all.  The pointlessness of these gestures wouldn't matter if they were at all pleasant to look at, but they're not - neither pleasant nor unpleasant, merely pretentious.But when all the scene-setting is out of the way, just when we're near despair, Shyamalan decides to settle down into, and trust, his story, which is a good one.  His earnest cinematic style becomes functional and attractive, just as it was in ""The Sixth Sense"" (if not quite to the same degree).  Perhaps this earnest style is the very best thing about the film. Few modern writers and directors are as courageous as Shyamalan: most would be too timid to take their material as seriously as this.If anything it's more cleverly constructed than ""The Sixth Sense"".  The only thing making it an inferior film (apart from the clumsy artiness of the opening) is the fact that the fantasy scenario isn't as interesting or emotionally powerful this time - not that this is anything to be ashamed of. Neither joky, cynical, self-referential nor self-effacing in its desire to entertain... it's a pleasure to watch.",Unbreakable
99,Seraphion,Taking our childhood reading into a more serious nature,6,8 October 2014,"The movie opens up cryptically with puzzle pieces about the story. It then develops slowly and shocks with the revelation of the main conflict. The mystery aura, which was held up in the background, appear to the surface and stays there even until at the ending. The sad overall aura is constantly kept all along the entire movie. All those flashes helps a bit in explaining the mystery of David's powers. There are quite strange scenes for me, though. For instance, David's moral value looks slightly contradicted at when he's bench pressing and when his son points a gun at him. The story gives a large room for a sequel, but that would make it into another superhero movie, which won't be able to compete amid the recent trend of superhero movies. Bruce Willis acted out the sad mood very nicely, it looks like what he did in Twelve Monkeys. Samuel L.

These are...:SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!Good Willis performance. Sad, something missing, something out of synch in his life, typical blue collar feel to his characterization. Willis was believable and I thought quite committed to the role.Sammy Jax was OK though what was up with that Buckwheat hair? Hmmmm. I liked him here, interesting kinda character to be playing too.Robin Wright(of Gump fame) does her normal 'strained beauty' bit, didn't see anything outstanding one way or another with her.  I thought the kid was okay too, basic sitcom kid w/a '70s haircut. That was cool too.
As far as the build up, I liked it. I liked the old 'Spidey Sense' that Willis had whenever he bumped into baddies-a jewel theif here, a robber there, a racist thug there-very nicely done. I liked the slow pace of discovery. I liked how he was shown slowly trying to piece back his marriage/family together through all of this. And I liked the hints from the past-the pool, the accident-which showed that his 'Unbreakable' ability was real.The battle in the house with the home invader was nicely done, and a kinda realistic Superhero doing. It's not like Dr Doom is waiting around the corner with an army of DoomBots, guys. The whole falling into the pool was quite good too.I also thought the ending-where Sammy Jax is shown to be the guy who derailed the train, blew up the hotel, etc etc-to be a little unbelievable given his inability to fall down stairs without breaking into 100 pieces-but at least it lets us in on what his character was truly all about.

My opinion hasn't changed -- this is a bizarre and ultimately unsatisfying tale inspired by comic books -- but it is interesting to watch Bruce Willis turn into a super hero of sorts. It also is interesting to watch his developing relationship with his son, who almost shoots him at one point. But the film is just too off the wall, and its appeal will lie with art-house crowd at best. Sam Jackson plays a comic book-obsessed cripple who sets up a series of terrible accidents in order to ferret out a super hero. M. Nighgt hasn't made a satisfying film since SIXTH SENSE, which is truly sad.

Entertainment: somehow Mr. Shy manages to intrigue the spectator and, with the good directing, force the audience to keep playing attention 3. Originality: I personally have never seen a movie like thisBad things:1. Writing: Mr. Shy carries the story on and on and gets to nowhere. Not to mention the slow development. 2. Confusion: in the last 30 minutes, there are thousand of scenes that we have no idea of what the main actor is doing. Actually, sometimes we don't even know if it's really him. 3. Ending: what on earth was intend of it?? the story got nowhere and seemed to be a moral lesson about superheroes. It's very not satisfying.Despite that, the movie shows that Mr. Shy is extremely able to make an horror movie if he wants to. There are quite few scenes that we have some jumps, and we see that if the director wanted, he could make the most creepy atmosphere ever.

If it were real people living real ordinary lives with zero flash? Unbreakable asks this questions to the viewers.The film is incredibly well shot and shows patience. I really enjoyed Shyamalan using alternate ways to show basic conversations. Like at the beginning when Willis is talking to the sports agent and we never leave the seats in front of them, or when we are with the second survivor before he dies the whole time Willis is talking to the doctor. These little things break the ordinary mold of a simple conversation and adds some interesting elements to keep our attention.Shyamalan, who also writes the films he directs, shows us that he's a talented guy. He knows what stories to craft and how to tell them, sometimes they are a hit, sometimes they are a miss. Then you have his big misses, but I give the guy credit for trying something different each time. From ghosts, to aliens and unknown forces. Kudos to the guy for trying to dive into different genres.Unbreakable is never thrilling, nor edge of your seat entertainment, it's never meant to be either. There are some intense moments though, specifically when his son thinks shooting him will prove he's a superhero. Well written, directed and acted on everyone's part.I liked the film, but felt it lacked to really grab me. It just seemed to be a well done film and nothing more, nothing to want me to explore this world or the people in it. It has a lot going for it too, the cast is great, the writing is superb and it has layers that the viewers peels away at, to get to that ultimate reveal. Yet at the same time, I was never blown away by anything.

And I don't mind admitting that he sure knows how to build up a certain mysterious atmosphere and frightening scenes. But saying that he's one of the greatest directors, just because of that, I will not. At least not until he has made another 15 or 20 great movies...With ""Unbreakable"" he has kept one of his traditions alive. He has directed the movie, produced it, has played a little role in it and has written the script for it. This time the story is about an ordinary man who suddenly becomes very special. But the seemingly ordinary and perfectly normal security guard David Dunn is not only the sole survivor of a horrific train-crash that killed 131 people, he didn't even have a scratch on him afterwards. A little later, comic book specialist and art gallery owner Elijah Price, nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"" due to his more than fragile bones, contacts him to confront him with an incredible theory: he believes that Dunn is his exact opposite, that they both seem to be 'linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends'. He's convinced that comic books are what remains of an ancient system of storytelling, that the superheroes they are about, are based on real people and that Dunn is one of these people. At first Dunn doesn't believe him, but as he keeps thinking about it, he finds out that he has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't...Normally I'm not a fan of movies based on comic books, so I already immediately assumed that I wouldn't like this movie either, just because of the subject. But I'm wrong. This is actually a nice and mysterious thriller with an interesting story and some fine acting. Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Elijah Price, but I guess it is Bruce Willis who surprised me the most. I sure hope to see him more often in this kind of 'serious' roles, instead of in the role of some action hero... The entire movie looks more than OK and I admit that M. Night Shyamalan has done a nice job with it. I hope that he'll make a lot more movies like this one, because I really liked it. I give it a 7.5/10.",Unbreakable
108,Chase_Witherspoon,A concept without a coherent plot,3,30 December 2012,"The typical twist that's synonymous with a Shyamalan movie isn't enough here to restore coherency to the narrative, where, somewhere in the ponderous, epic 110 minutes, it lost its way in a labyrinth of symbolisms and cryptic clues in which a bewildered Bruce Willis tries to understand why he's suddenly, apparently, invincible. Able to survive fatal train wrecks, bench elite-standard steel and generally surpass mere mortal feats, Bruce has become concerned he might be the world's strongest man, an endowment that is sure to carry an equally onerous duty.Once you get past Willis, Jackson (as a shady stranger sent to recruit Willis' newfound skills) and Wright (playing Willis' concerned wife), the cast thins out faster than the leading man's receding hairline. Not that the supporting cast is amateurish, but there's a conspicuous absence of familiar faces, names with which you can be comfortable.The pacing was a distinct challenge for me, and the long-awaited climax and inevitable twist ending, was lacklustre, failing to warrant the hype. After a laborious hour-an-a-half, I was expecting a lot more and was left disappointed.",Unbreakable
109,begob,I broke it,5,7 October 2015,"A man who mysteriously survives a train wreck gropes for the purpose of his life after meeting a stranger who sees the fantastic in the ordinary.A superhero story that emphasises the ordinary and mundane, as the hero plods along in the acceptance that his life is failing - from a compromised marriage, awkward fatherhood, and sacrifice of ambition. The anti-hero cuts across this with the insight that cartoon drama is just an exaggeration of the truth and that wonderful things really can happen. Sounds good? I guess, but it's underdeveloped and badly written.The first forty five minutes have excellent cinematography, with the camera moving around the frame in a way that adds so much to the story: the side to side in the train carriage, the depth of perspective in the hospital treatment room, the use of the colosseum stadium etc. It's worth it just for that.But none of the relationships hold up - a physiotherapist wife who never realised her hubbie wasn't really injured in the fateful accident? None of it is true and clear, so the actors have to ham their way through daft dialogue while swelling strings cover up the weakness of the story. I like the idea of bringing hope to the complications of adult life, but the result is juvenile.They missed out one laugh - a scene where the babysitter explains her sister phoned to say she just got a perm that makes her look like ... But the script cut her off. Like Richard Simmons?Overall, the story rides its big production values until it gets swamped.",Unbreakable

Without a scratch on his body. Soon he is contacted by comic-book store owner Elijah Price whose bones are easily breakable, who claims David is a superhero.Unlike Shayamalan previous movie, ""Unbreakable"" is not a thriller/suspense type film. In fact, it's a different film. It's a superhero movie. Don't worry. This is not the twist, if you think of it that way. It's revealed within seconds during the passage shown on the screen about comic books. This is when you know you're watching a different movie.Unlike many superhero films, ""Unbreakable"" does it in a realistic way so it can fit in this world, much along like the TV show ""Heroes,"" although the powers and visual effects aren't exaggerated. The film is really subtle. It tends to stay away from what lots of superhero movies have, like big action sequences, for the most part, costumes, and other things. However, it's still a lot like a superhero movie, like this is possibly the start of a trilogy. This is an origin film.Although I loved the movie a lot for its originality, I was disappointed in the end because it was uneventful, probably for budget issues or to ground the movie to a realistic level. Still, I can't help but say it was uneventful. Apart from that, I enjoyed the film immensely. The directing is one of M. Night's best. It's very top notch with a lot of technical movements. The performances by both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are equally great, actually. I was quite surprised.This is not ""The Sixth Sense."" This is no thriller/suspense type film. It's a superhero movie. It's a very different superhero movie. Warning you before hand, I hope you can enjoy this as much as I did. I loved the originality, although it's in the vein of a comic book story, with an origin story to start out a possible franchise. The performances, script, directing, and score are all top notch.",Unbreakable

Unless you like good-vs-evil dichotomy-exploring flicks (yeah, like those are just overwhelming the public these days). Unbreakable is basically a Watchmen-type exploration of what ""superheroes"" would really be like, and how they come down to us through myth and (urban) legend.  The movie is basically a two man show between Willis and Jackson, and they're both up for the job.",Unbreakable
112,Luigi Di Pilla,TOO SLOW PACED...,6,2 May 2003,"...and too overrated I think. It began as it ended I mean it never got any suspense and a certain dynamic. This movie could have been better packed as a supernatural thriller but the director didn´t succeed completely. The music from James Newton Howard was very good and it helped to create the mysterious situations. The end was the only thing I liked but it was not enough to rate this one about average. If you want to see more interesting films than this I highly recommend ""THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" or ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" from the same director. Perhaps the director N. Shyamalan should stop to write and to direct his own stories. With ""The Sixth Sense"" he was successfully but after ""Unbreakable"" and his latest ""Signs"" he produced definitely two flops. 6/10.",Unbreakable

114,valadas,Meaningless and inconclusive,6,19 February 2001,"The shoemaker mustn't go beyond the slipper (old Portuguese proverb)and M. Night Shyamalan seems to be totally incapable of making a valid movie based on the top ideas behind this one. It would require the talent and genius of a Carpenter or a Kubrick. Moreover a thriller is supposed to thrill and this story of a man who cannot be physically hurt or wounded due to a supernatural power while another man in the opposite extreme of the human life spectrum is called Mr. Glass because his bones are so weak that they get broken by the least blow, is told in a dull and monotonous way of mostly inconclusive and almost meaningless images, scenes and sequences which aren't fit to thrill anyone. Near the end the movie seems to stir a little more but it ends inconclusively and meaninglessly once more. The attempt of connecting the story to the universe of comics is not convincing or understandable. In short, this movie is a failure though maybe original in terms of ideas which are not bad in terms of fiction and could be better developed by another director with the capacity and skill to feel their depth and put it out in convincing images and scenes.",Unbreakable

Damn. The cinematography in this is just GREAT.",Unbreakable
116,Howlin Wolf,Shyamalan may just be a one-trick pony...,5,19 October 2001,"""The Sixth Sense"" was a great movie; and while ""Unbreakable"" is not truly awful, it does perhaps suggest that we should reserve judgement for a few more films before hailing its director as the new 'wunderkind' of his generation.The main problem with the film for me was that almost every aspect of its style was familiar after watching the ""Sixth Sense"". Sure, they have different plots, but there are a number of striking similarities. Bruce Willis playing a reserved 'everyman' type, both movies being bookended with set-pieces or twists, and the slow pacing. Don't get me wrong, it was very good when he used these things the first time round, but I wanted something a little different from his second outing.The film still managed to hold my attention though, and the plot was more unusual and complex than may seem apparent at first glance. No complaints about Willis' performance again, and Jackson is also good in a different type of role to that he usually plays. Even Robin Wright-Penn is good as Dunn's wife, despite the fact that her character plays little more than a bit-part in the main thrust of the story.So there IS a lot to like here, and if you haven't seen ""The Sixth Sense"" then my gripes won't make any difference to how you view the film. I personally got tired by what I saw as a basic retread by Shyamalan of his earlier effort, with a few plot points re jigged for good measure. Also, the ending - which I won't reveal here - lacks punch when compared to the surprise at the end of ""The Sixth Sense"".At the time of writing, Shyamalan is reportedly planning an ""Unbreakable"" trilogy. This doesn't bode well for me; because like I said, it WAS an innovative style when it first appeared, but it has the potential to lose its appeal when repeated over three or four movies.",Unbreakable

118,pyrocitor,What is a hero?,8,22 February 2008,"After the enormous success of iconic thriller The Sixth Sense, one would hardly be surprised to see director M. Night Shyamalan attempting to recapture the elements which made his call to fame such a success, delivering yet another chilling psychological thriller with a requisite twist ending in the mould of its predecessor. With that in mind, one has to give Shyamalan all the more credit for resisting such a temptation and making Unbreakable, which one could hardly call a conventional follow-up. While the film could similarly be described as a psychological thriller, it is less about its twist (though there is one), and more about journeying alongside the intricately crafted characters, watching the immaculate plot unfold, and reveling in the director's convoluted cunning. Allaying any potential fears of his former mastery waning, Shyamalan has lost one of his trademark storytelling skill. The film's pacing is excellent - slow and thoughtful, yet consistently tense and engaging enough to prevent lagging. Shyamalan's script proves deceptively simple, but with enough underlying layers of meaning that it may take until the film's culmination for all the immaculately crafted intricacies to sink in. The only real complaints which emerge involve an ending which comes across as slightly jarring and abrupt, and certain lapses in credulity and logic, despite the film's lucrative content. Similarly, with such a quality film, one wishes Shyamalan could have pushed the envelope more and further explored his fascinating themes and characters in more depth, but such complaints pale in the face of such an astutely quality overall work. With a superb use of colours and innovative cinematography, Shyamalan perfectly captures his subject matter with an exceptional, moody comic book style look, sealing the film's firm overall sense of quality. Resisting the temptation to turn his subject matter into a run of the mill thriller, Shyamalan instead crafts a reflective meditation on the nature and origins of heroism, and its essential importance in society. Demonstrating clear knowledge and reverence for the field of comic books, Shyamalan draws out unprecedented layers of meaning from an art form generally associated with banal childhood stories by the general public. Using the archetypal comic book structure as allegorical for humanity, and its romanticized desire for exceptional powers and abilities, Shyamalan makes a reverence for comics seem mature, inspirational, and commendable - no easy feat indeed. Shyamalan's cast easily lives up to the staunch quality of the rest of his film, delivering understated yet powerful performances. A subdued Bruce Willis proves tremendously effective as David Dunn, the sole survivor of a terrible accident increasingly drawn into a world of uncertainty and bewilderment, and Willis' easy charisma makes for an engaging but still poignant performance. Samuel L. Jackson is an eerie and haunting presence as a bone- diseased comic book obsessee, bringing effortless class and credibility to a part which would have been hard to sell with a lesser actor. Robin Wright Penn delivers quality support, bringing to life the human component of the film as Dunn's struggling wife. Similarly, Spencer Treat Clarke defies the conventions of his age group, resulting in a surprisingly powerful and heartfelt performance as Dunn's idealistic son.While the film may have been somewhat misrepresented as a ""thriller"" as opposed to a more thoughtful introspective examination of deeper underlying themes, Shyamalan's second effort proves an unconventional but tremendously powerful follow-up to The Sixth Sense. With a careful, deliberately paced script and a sturdy cast to back the material up, Unbreakable is quality storytelling at its finest, while still providing the viewer with a new appreciation for comic books and copious amounts of food for thought. Shyamalan has crafted his film with the utmost of care, and the dark beauty of Unbreakable will stick with the viewer for quite some time, intriguing and entertaining hand in hand. -8/10",Unbreakable

Note 6.8",Unbreakable
121,baumer,Know one thing.....Shyamalan is a genius.,10,24 November 2000,"Warning: does contain spoilers.As we all sat in theater and we saw the haunting image of Bruce Willis being told in an eerie and confused voice by a doctor that he was the sole survivor of a train wreck, and that he wasn't scarred or broken in any way, we were intrigued.  Then those magic words flash across the screen....FROM THE WRITER AND DIRECTOR OF SIXTH SENSE.  Now we are hooked.  Toss in Samuel L. Jackson playing the prophet, and now we have perhaps the most anticipated film of the year.  And yet the funniest thing about the whole thing is that no one really had a clue what the film was about.  All we knew is that Bruce had a secret.  So going into the film, we were really all just conformists hoping that this film was going to capture us the way Sixth Sense did.  Now I don't think that this film is for everyone, which seemss to be the general consensus from other reviewers in here, but for those that understand the film and for those that can appreciate it, you are in for a treat. 
From here on out, if you don't want to know what the film is about, then stop reading. Bruce Willis plays David Dunne, who, as the film opens is riding on that doomed train destined to crash.  We all know this from the trailers.  But as he is riding on that train, a pretty young woman asks if the seat is taken next to him and he says no.  As she sits down, he takes off his wedding ring and begins to flirt with her.  As we already know, somewhere along the way in the film, we are going to see that Willis may have some sort of gift that prevents him from injury, but that doesn't mean he is unbreakable in other facets of his life.  Somewhere along the way, he has lost contact with his family and he and his wife don't even hold hands as he is being released from the hospital.  Upon leaving the funeral for the passengers of the train wreck that he survived, he finds a note on his car from a place called LIMITED EDITION, and on it, it asks him how many days he has ever been sick in his life. This question intrigues him and since he can't remember himself, he goes to the one source that knows him better than he knows himself, his wife.  She can't ever remember him being sick.""Doesn't that strike you as odd?"" he asks her.When David finally meets Elijah Price, we learn that Elijah has sought him out because Elijah is one of the most breakable men in the world.  His bones are easily broken and his cells react very poorly to disease and have a hard time fighting off even the common cold.  It seems that these two are the complete opposite.  Elijah tells David that he believes he is  ""unbreakable"" simply because Elijah is not.  If a man like Elijah exists, then there must be a man out there that is on the other side of the spectrum. 
The rest of the film moves along slowly, not in a bad way but slowly enough so that we have time to understand everyone involved.  Shyamalan cares about his characters and he does take them seriously.  He wants us to know them and understand them, so that when the big secret is unveiled to us, not only do we understand why the secret is the way it is, but we also understand how the movie was filmed and why it was done so in the way it was.  Get it? Well don't worry if you don't.  See it again and you will.I read a review about Unbreakable by the venerable Roger Ebert, and he praised the film but then criticized the ending saying that it felt like it was rushed, that more care was needed, so instead of giving it four stars he gave it three.  My response to that is this:I am not a lover or a connoisseur of the thing that Shyamalan is.  I will not reveal what that is, but saffice it to say that if you at least understand them, then you will see what the direction the film is heading in.  There are many hints and subtleties that you can begin to guess about half way through the film what is happening.  That is not to say that the secret is not shocking, because it is.  It's just that this time you can see it coming from a far.  And that is done through actions, camera shots, camera angles, the colouring of the film, the dialogue, and the costumes. This is a brilliant film that wants to emulate a passion that one man has for one particular thing in this world.  And when you open your film by telling your audience that the world of COMICS is bigger than any of us imagined, well that should give us a clue right there.  Make no mistake about it, this film is calculated from beginning to end.Unbreakable is one of the best films to come out this year and the great thing about is that it is simple but effective and Shyamalan may have just created a franchise for himself and Willis and Jackson.  Touchstone is probably counting the dollars as we speak.I do recommend that this film be viewed twice, not because the secret is as good as Sixth Sense was, but because it is a film worth viewing several times.  And yes, when you do give it a second viewing, you will understand it more and praise it more, and crave the next one.10 out of 10- Sheer brilliance.",Unbreakable

126,hnt_dnl,Underrated film,10,27 July 2018,"When I think of my favorite filmmakers, M. Night Shyamalan doesn't even usually register. I know he's made some suspect flicks ever since his early successes in the late 90s/early 00s, with a recent re-juvenation with the highly acclaimed blockbuster Split and the pending Glass which feels like another surefire success. In between, he's definitely made some head-scratchers, although I kind of enjoyed The Visit more than I thought I would. While The Sixth Sense is probably considered his best film among most, I honestly was kind of bored by it and think it was a wee bit pretentious. I actually believe his best films (so far) are between Split and this one I'm reviewing UNBREAKABLE (2000). 
I'm not the biggest fan of either Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson, but this might actually be arguably the best film that either of them have been in! Yeah, I know they were both in this popular flick called Pulp Fiction and have separately been in a lot of good stuff, but in terms of quality, the level of their acting, the naturalistic writing, atmosphere, and direction, this is probably the true best film either of them have done, in my opinion. And, to me, unlike the rather gimmicky Pulp Fiction which looks dated 20+ years later, Unbreakable looks like a flick that looks fresh even in 2018. Willis is superb as David Dunn, a depressed family man who is a native Philadelphian (film's setting, duh it's Shamalyan! LOL) and works as security at the city's football stadium. In the film's opening Dunn survives a train derailment that killed every passenger except him. Upon being released, David is reunited with his wife Audrey (strong performance by Robin Wright) and son Joseph (impressive work by Spencer Treat Clark). David was on a job interview in New York and planning to divorce Audrey, who he's lived in an estranged marriage for years. News of the tragedy piques the interest of another native Philadelphian Elijah Price (brilliantly played by Jackson). Price is a collector of classic comic books and owns a his own art gallery. Elijah was born with a rare disease where his bones are incredibly fragile and easy to fracture. He's suffered multiple bone breaks during his life and walks with a cane. Price contacts Dunn and theorizes that David is the opposite of him, a human with superpowers and encourages David to embrace his gift.The film is a provocative, interesting exploration into the possibility of a person actually having superhuman abilities and the pressure, strain, and responsibility that goes along with it. David was also an ex-football player whose career was ruined in a car accident many years earlier, so this new ""gift"" is like a second calling for him. Shyamalan occupies the film with a sequence of strong, character-driven scenes that build up exquisitely through dialogue and character. No explosions, no CGI, no car chases, just good old-fashioned conversation. The acting is uniformly excellent and in addition to the aforementioned Willis, Jackson, Wright, and Clark, solid work is done by Charlayne Woodard as Elijah's mother as well as by veteran Elizabeth Lawrence (of All My Children fame) in a spooky scene at Joseph's school.I definitely like this film more than Sixth Sense and it's probably on equal footing with Split for me. And with the pending Glass, looks like Shyamalan is back!",Unbreakable
127,reddiemurf81,WoW!!,8,16 August 2020,"Can't believe it took me 20 yrs to finally watch this!! This has got to be Shyamalan's masterpiece! While I love Marvel and DC movies,, I'd also really like to see more superhero movies like this.So go watch it!!",Unbreakable
128,mattymatt4ever,"Fascinating, intriguing comic book fantasy",8,24 July 2001,"No, this isn't a comic book fantasy like the ""Batman"" films.  This is more on the quiet side, but it's also more on the intelligent side.  M. Night Shyamalan directed this film in a way that you're intrigued the minute the images appear on screen.  Sure, those with a low attention span might not have enough patience to deal with the character development (though a few scenes were redundant and slowed things down a little) and subtle insights into the essence of comic book folklore.  Bruce Willis plays an average Joe. He delivers a very effective, yet restrained performance that should (if it hasn't yet) prove his quality as an actor, rather than a performer.  Willis' character David Dunn is a security guard at a football stadium in Philadelphia.  He has a wife and kid.  And suddenly, because of one fatal train ride, his life has taken a turn for the worst--or better.  Who knows? Everyone finds it strange and a little bothersome that Dunn was the only one to rise from the violent crash, not only alive but without a scratch.  Some find it disturbing because their loved ones died, while he--for no apparent reason--came out in one piece.  There's a great deleted scene--if you check out the DVD--where he's sorting out his problems with a local priest.  Even the priest doesn't approve of the fact that a member of his family got killed while he lived, because supposedly he's the ""Chosen One.""  Even Dunn himself doesn't know why he's the ""Chosen One"" and why he's given these powers to make him indestructable.  So that sends him out on an investigation, leading him to comic book collector Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson).  Jackson's performance is brilliant, as always.  He has even more rage towards Dunn because he's the opposite:  his disease causes his bones to be very brittle.  Dunn is like the hero in this comic book adventure and Elijah is the arch nemesis.  Like the filmmakers explained in the extra features section, there's no good unless there's evil and there's no evil unless there's good.  And the whole reason for Elijah's search for this ""unbreakable"" hero was so he can have someone to duel against.  That's an example of evil craving good.  I love the climax, where the whole story magnificently comes together and all the secrets are revealed. 
The cinematography is excellent.  It perfectly brings you into the film. And it's nice the way they chose different color patterns to convey the different moods in each scene, and of each character.  That's another element that was nicely explained the extra features.""Unbreakable"" is a dark, quietly fascinating thriller that kept me intrigued from start to finish.  If you're looking for loud, superficial thrills--this is not the movie for you.  If you're looking for something really exciting, but in a subtle way, this is a film you'll enjoy and won't soon forget. 
My score:  8 (out of 10)",Unbreakable
129,Fernando-Rodrigues,didn't worked for me that much,6,13 September 2020,"It's the weakest movie from the trilogy. Not a bad movie, just a overrated dull story.

130,sharky_55,They called me Mr Glass,8,27 February 2016,"Every little boy wants to believe that their dad is invincible. At some point in their infancy, they might very well believe in the fact. For young Joseph, it becomes a tiny spark amongst whispers of divorce and separation. We open on a conversation on a train - the woman feels a hint of flirting, and we are not sure the status of David's marriage, but he hastily apologizes for being too forward, but it is too late. This scene, and many others in the movie, showcases Shyamalan's talent for his frames within frames; the camera situated in front of the pair, peering through the slit between the seats, and roving back and forth, in an unbroken take. And then later, to demonstrate that something is wrong with the train, he uses a tiny little clue; David peering down the line and seeing something clutch for dear life onto the armrest. It is confident visually. See another notable unbroken shot, where the camera spins around the entire hospital waiting room to emphasises the scale of the tragedy and loss of the crash, and how Shyamalan just holds it for long enough to express how awe-inspiring and mysterious that he is the sole survivor. He contrasts the dark tone of the film with these inappropriately lurid colour schemes that are slightly filtered with a griminess for realism; green for David, purple for Elijah, as if to signal their allegiance, and to nod to the comic- book influence with its bold, striking images. Opposing the modern trend of flashy, in-your-face superhero movies, it never feels the need to wow the audience with its superpowers and special effects. That comes near the end, where Shyamalan slightly overcompensates with the unmistakable imagery of the poncho billowing in the wind like a cape, and carrying Audrey up to bed like a Lois Lane to his Superman. The human and emotional element, which normally might take a back- seat to the cool powers and effects, is exceptionally well integrated. The wife and son are not pushed to the side but brilliantly woven into the story. See the heartbreaking scene where Wright confesses she wants to start over, because she sees his miraculous survival as some sort of sign, a second chance for their marriage. It is sweet to see them nervous as they go through the first date questions all over again. And a child willing to shoot his father might be absurd in most cases, but it works here. His motive is understandable, and David's threats of moving away are the grounded reasoning that the scene needs to build to a climax, and then wither, to our relief. And yet, there is a small part of us that wants to see it happen, to provide us with some evidence and kick the film into action. We see a little hint of it initially, with how they carefully build his strength via the weightlifting scene, and how the camera seems to move with the bar, as if David was lifting the whole frame with him. But Shyamalan wisely knows that David is not ready, and postpones the reveal.Elijah, the villain of the movie, is delicately crafted. Jackson refuses the urge to go overboard is his performance; it is slightly eccentric, but he has enough awareness to ease the tension with humour, and not be completely diabolical. Shyamalan is smart enough to make him sympathetic while not overdoing the concealed bitterness and anger of his existence - as he chases down a man, he comes to a long flight of stairs, and the soundtrack turns shrill, and haphazardly zooms out to highlight the danger of such a mundane setting to Elijah. We feel for how dangerous this is and how sick he must be of the constant hospital visits and rehab, even as we frantically want to catch the man and reveal his secret. As he falls, it is with a dizzying, painful potency. And when that classic Shyamalan plot twist is revealed, we almost feel for how he has been treated and his desperate desire to find a truer purpose. He screams that they kids used to call him 'Mr Glass', and the line between cartoonish and realism has been immaculately tread.",Unbreakable
131,jhclues,Shyamalan Delivers An Original,10,3 December 2000,"Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan faced a formidable task in delivering a follow-up to his last outing, `The Sixth Sense,' which was a remarkable film; and his attempt at capturing that same quality and integrity in his latest effort has resulted in a film that, while it does not surpass `Sense,' is nothing less than it's equal.  Beginning with a screenplay that is brilliant in concept, content and structure, and realized with equal acuity,  `Unbreakable,' starring Bruce Willis, is a unique, challenging film that will test the limits of audience perception like never before.  From the cryptic opening scene to the denouement, this is enthralling drama that offers singular insight into the dark capabilities of human nature, and a perspective of evil never before suggested in any movie in the history of the cinema.  Conan Doyle said there's nothing new under the sun, and that may be true; other films may have dealt with similar themes, but the approach Shyamalan takes here is entirely original. 	Shyamalan approaches his material like a quiet, unobtrusive Hitchcock, resulting in a style that is quite his own.  His pace is deliberate, and information is doled out in subtle, measured proportions which affords the discerning viewer a chance to  place the myriad pieces of the puzzle into proper order as the story unfolds.  It's a mystery that refuses to let you off the hook, and demands that you think about what is actually going on without respite.  To say that this is thought provoking material would be an understatement; it's an intricate story, the plot of which is complemented by equally complex characters who are detailed and extremely well written and developed. 	As he did in `The Sixth Sense,' Bruce Willis proves once again that there is so more to him as an actor than being just an action hero.  His portrayal of David Dunn, a man facing a transitional period in his life, is played with a staid countenance that successfully reflects the inner turmoil of the character.  You know from the outset that there is something going on beneath the surface; something unsettling for which Dunn is seeking resolution.  When he becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, it adds to the irresolution in his life as he is suddenly confronted with new issues that take him into still deeper, uncharted waters.  Willis gives a performance that is understated with nuance and depth, and gives Dunn a sense of controlled distress with which the audience can readily identify; that unknown, intangible something that one can feel, yet which remains elusive and unnamed.  It's a powerful statement that illustrates the thin line between reality and the surreal.  Samuel L. Jackson gives a strong performance as well, as Elijah Price, victim of a congenital disease that renders his existence fragile in the extreme.  It's a sympathetic character that somehow refutes sympathy; and Jackson has a presence that makes Elijah real and believable, which is pivotal, as his infirmity is integral to the plot, as is the fact that he and Dunn represent opposite ends of the vast spectrum of life.  Effective in a lesser, yet still significant role, is Robin Wright Penn (Audrey Dunn), who fleshes out the disarray of a wife dealing with the emotional absence of her husband. 	The supporting cast includes Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn), Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's Mother) and, in a cameo, M. Night Shyamalan (Stadium Drug Dealer).  With `Unbreakable,' Shyamalan has taken up the gauntlet and emerged victorious, with an intelligent, entertaining film so profound that it will no doubt become one of the most under-appreciated films of all time. There is simply a depth to it that will soar beyond the grasp of the casual viewer; few films have such substance and vision.  Like a Monet, this is art that is both impressionistic and invaluable; a true original in every aspect, and a testimony to the talents of M. Night Shyamalan.  I rate this one 10/10.",Unbreakable
132,educallejero,Individuality and masculinity as subject matter,6,18 September 2018,"As a literal superhero origin movie, I have to say, I was bored, mostly because of Bruce Willis performance, but also because his character was a bit too passive for a bit too long.But the human drama presented with the protagonist is actually really deep and interesting. I found things similar to ""The Incredibles"". Bruce Willis' character forgot about his dreams for love. And he regretted it since. He choose ""family"" over the individual. He choose family over his own goals and he was dissatisfied with it, which made him unhappy to the point of almost provoking his divorce, the very thing he sacrificed for in the first place.That's basically the metaphor I see, as a man unhappy by the fact that he let go what made him ""a mainly man"" (the use of his god given abilities, including physical strength) for a more complacent life that looked great when he was projecting his life as a younger man, but with time the power concession in favor of his wife in pursuit of the family unit (the symbolic reason to suppress his abilities, an emasculation), to his terrible boss in a terrible job (wasting potential taking abuse in exchange of economical security, another sacrifice for his family), and with his son (that thinks he's a coward for not using his powers, when in reality it is a sacrifice that the kid doesn't understand yet) made him so unhappy, he lost his will, similar to Mr. Incredible from the Incredibles.",Unbreakable

There was, after all, Plan Nine from Outer Space, Lost Horizon (1973), Pi, Lady in a Cage, and other assorted atrocities. But it definitely is in the neighborhood.If this an example of this Shyamalan fellow's supposed genius, I am decidedly unimpressed.Let's start with the pacing, which is on the level of watching paint dry or corn grow. Then there is the central plot idea, which goes way beyond suspension of disbelief. The concept is just simply preposterous.Bruce Willis appears to have been sedated. Samuel Jackson does the best he can with the ridiculous lines he must read. And as far as the supposed ""surprise ending,"" give me a break, please.

134,aciessi,Earth-shattering.,9,1 January 2019,"M. Night Shymalan's reputation as a filmmaker has become tainted to say the very least. People chuckle at the mere mention of his name. After seeing the film Unbreakable, it doesn't feel like a joke any more. It now feels tragic. Unbreakable is a masterpiece. One of the best directed, best written and best shot films of the 2000's. I was hypnotized by the first frame. The cinematography is a work of art. The angles and techniques that Shymalan choses to tell this unique story propels it to a whole new level. The train sequence is fascinating in its use of what I call ""The Seat Dolly"" to navigate through the dialogue. The POV of a young Glass looking at himself through a 1960's Television set is a truly powerful moment. Unbreakable through the visual language alone will take your breath away, and realize, there are ways to create a superhero epic than simply what Marvel has championed over the past 10 years. Is Unbreakable the greatest superhero movie? For my money, it is. It is the story of two men. One who can never be injured, and one who cant escape injury. By destiny, the two of them are spiritually connected. The reason we find is more Stan Lee-esque than we could ever imagine. This must have been a trip when it premiered 19 years ago, but it's even better and more poignant now than ever.",Unbreakable
135,rockman182,Unbreakable (2000),7,17 May 2017,"I saw this film many years ago and decided to check it out again. I re-watched a few of M. Night Shyamalan's films this year and just wanted to run through the very best of the lot. Having seen Split earlier in the year and learning of the sequel to Unbreakable coming out soon I think it was just time. I really love The Village and Signs from M. Night, in recent years his films have tanked but in the past he made some really solid work. Unbreakable isn't as good as those two mentioned earlier but its pretty great.The film is a superhero movie about a man who is unbreakable. He has super strength and radar to track criminals, and also can survive accidents without breaking a bone. On the other hand there is a man with a rare genetic disorder where his bones break very easily, he is aptly named Mr. Glass. Mr. Glass encounters David Dunn (the hero played by Bruce Willis) and lets him know about his powers. From there Dunn starts to realize his potential and what it means for him and his family. He also puts his powers into action and uses it to catch bad people who are committing crimes against humanity.This film is not perfect but its incredibly crafty and smart. Its such a subtle superhero film that really is well thought out. Having two opposite men who are on different ends of the spectrum, in terms of what their motivations are and their physical predispositions are is brilliant. M. Night was honestly a master of creating a gripping story with a twist in his early days, and this wasn't an exception. You get two really good performances from the two leads and also feel like the characters are quite strong and memorable. The film does delve into some scary bits, especially when Dunn finds out the crimes of some of the people he interacts with.This is no Village or Signs, or even Sixth Sense but Shyamalan reunites with Bruce Willis for quite an engaging effort that really is a tribute to comic books and the comic book structure. Its also got a wonderful score to boot. Its very easy to get lost in the film and I just love the way key plot points are drawn it and sucks you into the mood of the film. I would recommend checking this out because its one of the finer efforts from a director who was once great.7.5/10",Unbreakable
136,CharltonBoy,"""I see bad people""",9,1 September 2001,"Let me start by saying if on the DVD or Video it says  ""This is a follow up to The Sixth Sense"" take no notice. While this film does have the same feel it is by no means a follow up. Unbreakable is in some ways better the the sixth sense because it really does make you think all the way through the film as to what is happening. Bruce Willis plays security guard ,David Dunn,who is the only survivor in a train crash and is reminded by Elijah Price played by Samuel L Jackson that maybe there is more to his survival that meets the eye. If you are expecting an all action movie forget it because it is not what this film is about. If you are in to comic books you will love this although it is not a requirement .

137,gbheron,A Disappointment,5,4 July 2003,"Of the M. Night Shyamalan 'trilogy' (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) I found Shyamalan's take on the ghost story, The Sixth Sense, and his take on alien invasion, Signs, both excellent and entertaining movies. Shyamalan selects a tried-and-true topic and approaches it from a completely new angle infusing the story with a new freshness. I'd missed his film on comic book superheroes, Unbreakable, and anticipated my rental of it with relish. I shouldn't have. Shyamalan tries the same approach in Unbreakable, but with me it didn't ring true.  I'm not sure why. He had me believing in ghosts, and that there are aliens in the cornfield, but he didn't even come close to having me believe in superheroes. Bruce Willis, a grown man, living all his life and never suspecting that he has tremendous powers?  I never suspended belief and bought in to the story. I remained a skeptic throughout and by the astonishingly poor ending was ready to hit rewind.",Unbreakable
138,Bob-45,Unfortunate,4,30 June 2001,"I had high hopes for ""Unbreakable,"" after M. Knight Shymalyan's terrific ""The Sixth Sense"".  Sadly, all the things that worked so well with ""The Sixth Sense"" work against ""Unbreakable"". Shymalayan, the director seriously undercut Shymalayann, the writer, by eliminating a key scene (between a priest and Bruce Willis) which ties the film together better than anything else in its two plus tedious hours.  Willis plays David Duncan, the head of security at the ball park,who discovers, he is not only the ONLY survivor of a train derailment, he has not been hurt in any way.  He is contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), a ""comic book art"" collector, who tries to convince Willis that he and Willis are linked.  Elijah, you see, has a rare, serious bone deficiency, which results in his bones breaking easily; Elijah believes that Willis is super strong and nearly invulnerable, but doesn't know it.A BIG problem with the movie, is that the story shows only one character (Elijah) as a child.  Better if Elijay and David had been born in the same year, or even better, the same day.  Worse, it fails to provide any clues that any of the ""accidents"" which have occured are anything more than ""accidents.""  Thus, the climactic ""payoff"" is no ""payoff"" at all. 
Much of the time this movie appears to be going no where. Willis' character is dull, his wife (Robin Wright Penn) is dull and drab (and also looks ten years older than she is), and Jackson's character is simply too strange to generate much sympathy.Shymalyan really blew this one.",Unbreakable
139,TOMASBBloodhound,Interesting idea poorly executed.,5,7 May 2003,"When you think about it, this story by M. Night Shyamalan is really quite intriguing. A lowly security guard (Willis) comes out of a deadly train wreck without so much as a scratch. Next thing you know, he's got an odd-ball comic book store goon (Jackson) following him around trying to convince him he's some kind of super hero. When Willis thinks about his past, he realizes that there may be something to it all.Finding out the truth turns out to be not so interesting. This film is so slow-moving it's stillborn. Bruce Willis gives a much too low-key performance. Wouldn't a real super hero have more of a personality? The ""big surprise"" at the end can be seen from a mile away this time. It isn't as big a surprise as the one in The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan's hard core fans will do anything to defend this film. They really seem to love it. Others will not be all that impressed.2 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Unbreakable

He's not being confident about this finding but a strange character seems to always be there to guide him whenever needed.It's a movie which has a great premise which it slowly presents in parallel with the one of the other strange character. It builds up on it, piece by piece, until it reaches its mind-blowing finale, which took me completely by surprise. It's a story which also builds a lot of suspense, bringing something new all the time, enough to keep the viewer eager to find out what is going to happen next. It's characters are complex, well thought and put together while being likeable at the same time.In terms of action, the movie doesn't excel, far from it actually. In fact, it has such a slow pace that it almost feels like it's going to stop. I'm not expecting explosions or intense shooting and I can understand and like a slow movie, but this one felt like it was exaggerating, judging by any standards. Thus, this is my biggest complaint about it.Overall, I found a film which excels in storytelling, has a great plot and good characters but leaves a bit to be desired in terms of pace. It left a good sensation in terms of suspense and drama, which is another good thing, but it could have also a bit better when speaking of secondary characters.",Unbreakable

142,Maziun,Great tribute to and deconstruction of comic books,8,30 November 2013,"""Unbreakable"" was a movie that many had high expectations after the surprising success of ""The Sixth sense"" . The movie was met with mixed reactions . The next movie ""Signs"" also divided people and ""The Village"" can me called a breaking point of M. Night Shyamalan's career. His next movies became more and more worse and right now hardly anyone takes Shyamalan seriously. It's sad , because I really think that ""The Sixth sense"" , ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" while are not without flaws , are certainly good movies . The first two are great and deserve to appear on ""the best movies ever"" list . ""Unbreakable"" might be the best of Shyamalan movies . It stands better on repeated viewings than ""The Sixth sense"" . The ending is more logical and unpredictable and the whole movie doesn't seem to really too heavy on the surprising ending than it's famous ""older brother"". It's like a cherry on the top of delicious cake rather than the main attraction of the movie. The somber mood stays with you and whole picture really feels like a work of art , not entertainment. It does have few things in common with ""Sixth sense"" (Willis , atmosphere , twist endings , supernatural undertones) , but please watch it as an completely separate movie.This movie takes time for buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and it's heavily centered on characters and their psychology. Shyamalan might be the best director since Hitchcock with his ability to create suspense. Fall on the stairs , drowning in the swimming pool , the fight – those scenes are really breathtaking and magical.""Unbreakable"" walks a fine line between being realistic and comic bookish. This movie precedes ""Batman begins"" as the first superhero movie grounded in reality. It is however a psychological thriller , not an action movie. What if superhero did exist in real life ? Is Jackson's character right about Willis ? Shyamalan gives the audience many subtle hints that will become clear if you watch the movie again. There are many clever visual symbols , dialogue lines or camera angels that are references to comic books. They are also hints foreshadowing the ending of the movie. If you are a comic book fan you will probably notice them quicker than the rest of audience. As for the ending that was often criticized – it's perfect the way it is. It's a deconstruction of comic book logic. What happens here is what would happen in real life. It's pretty much goes against comic book fans expectations , just like the whole plot of this movie. It's sad that people weren't ale to see this.Bruce Willis (for the second time in a row works with Shyamalan) creates a completely convincing portrayal of average Joe with depression and family problems . There is a aura of sadness around him and that's says something about his acting skills. He's certainly more capable actor than the typical tough guy he often plays. What Willis does here is so subtle that many half-intelligent viewers will say that his not acting at all. Samuel L. Jackson is creepy , mysterious yet sympathetic at the same time. He's got a great chemistry with Willis (just like in ""Die hard with a vengeance""). There's something bizarre in him (in a positive way). As for the supporting characters Spencer Clark is great as Willis son and Robin Wright Penn is solid as Willis wife.Director of Photography Eduardo Serra did a great job . He used dark, slightly blue colored filter for most of movie time to create an haunting atmosphere . The movie does look really like a comic book with some of the camera angles. James Newton Howard also deserves praise for his silent , yet powerful soundtrack. The music during the fight is quite chilling.""Unbreakable"" is a movie about many things – about dysfunctional family, how comics have shaped popular culture in the 20th century and became modern myth , it wonders about the origins of evil and good , what it means to be a hero , about destiny and self realization. Too bad that the potential franchise was killed by the inpatient audience . Today , people get bored very quickly . If only they knew what they miss I give it 8/10.",Unbreakable
143,Libretio,Unique take on the 'superhero' mythos,5,22 January 2005,"UNBREAKABLE Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital Surround EX / DTS-ES / SDDSAfter surviving a horrific train crash in which every other passenger died, an unassuming security guard (Bruce Willis) is contacted by a man with a rare bone disease (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes Willis is gifted with superhuman powers, like a character from a comic book...Hoping for lightning to strike twice after the unexpected commercial success of his determinedly uncommercial breakout feature THE SIXTH SENSE (1999), M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed this stylistically similar movie, setting a pattern that might well define his entire career. With its measured pace and gradual accumulation of narrative details, UNBREAKABLE posits Willis as an ordinary man whose life is transformed by an experience which opens his eyes to a whole new way of thinking, courtesy of Jackson's guru-like figure, a broken man who views Willis as his exact opposite, a literal superhero, though quite unlike the 'comic book' supermen which Jackson covets so much (he runs an art gallery dedicated to the work of great comic book artists). In fact, Willis and Jackson are the whole show here, and they both command attention in very different roles, playing characters who inspire change in one another, for better AND worse. However, Willis' first act as a bona fide 'superhero' - a compelling sequence in which he confronts a very modern 'supervillain', far removed from the juvenilia of most comic book baddies - reveals the dark side of his newfound powers, which are as much a curse as a blessing. The director even manages a genuinely traumatic 'twist' - less predictable than the one in THE SIXTH SENSE - which has a devastating effect on the major players. With Willis' career in the doldrums at the time of the film's release, UNBREAKABLE didn't have quite the same cultural impact as Shyamalan's previous effort, but it works a similar kind of visual magic. Not for all tastes, though its rewards are legion.",Unbreakable

147,CountZero313,gets better with each viewing,9,6 September 2008,"David Dunn takes the train home from a job interview in New York. He rests his head against the window, looking tired and sad. A little girl stares at him through the seats in front. A hot woman sits down next to David, he slips off his wedding ring, and gives her some chat. But he comes on too strong, she feels uncomfortable, and she changes seat. David goes back to leaning against the window, encountering the reproachful stare of the little girl. This momentary failure of his moral compass is about to be surpassed by cataclysmic events.Unbreakable surprised and entertained me the first time I saw it. I am discovering it rewards you with repeat viewings. That opening scene is charged with sadness and regret and sets up so much of what we will discover about David's family life and a deeper inner turmoil he feels. It contrasts with another scene of family and children later in the film, after David has decided to embrace the gift he has. Sitting at the breakfast table, reunited emotionally once more with his wife, he shows his son a newspaper story, and silently mouths 'you were right' and 'don't tell Mum'. The son is vindicated, the father redeemed, and their tears are imbued with joy and yet restraint, as Mum is cooking two feet away and can never know.These quietly powerful moments reveal Shyamalan's powerful instincts as both writer and director. Scorsese said directors are 'managers of emotions,' Shyamalan's Unbreakable is a fine example of what that means. In the rescue scene, look at how the fact that the mother is dead is revealed. Look at how Dunn is rescued by the children he has just freed. From putting down the phone to Elijah, who tells him what he should do, through the rescue and breakfast reunion with his family, not a word of dialogue is spoken. That is a sign of a filmmaker with unerring instincts.Of course, 'unerring' is ironic in light of Shyamalan more recent outings. Signs, for example, takes the same constituent elements as Unbreakable and the end result is risible. But Unbreakable is a fine film that gets great performances from Willis and Jackson, two actors who tend to be only as good as the directors collaborating with them. Dunn's journey from self-denial twice over (after the car accident and then when initially faced with Elijah's question), through discovery, to full flowering and then horror at the manipulation he has fallen prey to, is subtly and movingly portrayed beat by beat by Willis.And the surprise ending, when you first encounter it, is breath-taking. On repeat viewing, you appreciate more the exhausting emotional changes Dunn has come through up to that moment right before they shake hands. The handshake becomes a thing of tragic beauty. Dunn's sadness, so long carried and at such cost, is cruelly thrust once more upon him.Shyamalan, since Lady in the Water, has been almost reduced to a figure of fun. It is a great pity - viewing Unbreakable makes you hope that he can recover form and produce more work of this calibre.",Unbreakable
148,RJBurke1942,"Which shows that true heroes are born, not made.",8,13 June 2008,"Years ago, I read a newspaper story about an elderly woman who lifted up the back of car to free her son trapped beneath: the jack had failed and the car was crushing him Somehow, she lifted that car, her feat defying belief. But that frail, old woman saved her son with strength she didn't know she had  until she needed it. Call it an adrenalin rush, call it what you will, but it happened.So, desperate situations do bring about desperate measures by people who don't appear to have the strength or will to accomplish a seemingly impossible feat. Until they're forced into action...At that level and that level alone, Unbreakable could have been a great movie, I think. But, because it skates on the edge of the paranormal, it loses some impact for me. Nevertheless, it's an excellent story, well acted and exquisitely directed by M. Night Shyamalan, famous for The Sixth Sense (1999).Don't get me wrong, however: I'm open to the concept of the paranormal because I've experienced things that can't be explained by rational means or knowledge. You may have also.This isn't the first film, however, to explore the idea of the super-man (let's put aside all comic book stuff, despite the heavy influence of comic books in Unbreakable): in 1968, a Frank M. Robinson novel, called The Power, was put to a film of the same name. It was heavily criticized, and yet it was a well produced rendition of an excellent sci-fi story: about an evil man with super, paranormal powers who stumbles upon a good man with identical powers. The ensuing battle for supremacy between the two made for great entertainment. And, as in Unbreakable, you don't know the identity of the evil man until close to the end. The key point with The Power, however, is that the good man didn't know he had the power  until he was tested to the point of death. And the twist at the end was irony at its best...Unbreakable takes up that idea of the super-man, where David Dunn (Bruce Willis), through a complex series of connected events, finally comes to realize that he is much more than other mortals.David is a security guard at a local university; but he used to be the brightest prospect in American football. Unhappily, he has a marriage that's all but dead: done in by years of sadness, discomfort, distrust and doubt. He is consumed with sadness, and not only because Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic book aficionado and art gallery owner, tells him that the saddest people are those who don't know why they're on this earth...Indeed, the happiest person is the one who knows his/her destiny, the reason for being. Hence slowly, but inexorably, David comes to the realization that his purpose on earth is to provide security for the oppressed, to help those who cannot help themselves, and to stop the path of evil, wherever and whenever. Thus emerges the closest yet to a modern-day superhero.As you will see, it's an unwelcome realization for David, at first. But he finally grasps that he is the defender of good; moreover, he discovers he has the strength and power to do it. And, in the climactic confrontation with a diabolical home invader, David proves it  to himself and to others. That knowledge for David has a price, however: Good can only exist  can only make sense  when Evil exists as a co-partner. And, therein lies the greatest irony for poor David.I loved this movie. It appeals to the heroic in all of us. It shows that evil can be countered effectively  and without the need for questionable vigilante exploits. Implicitly also, it suggests that the heroic is potentially within all of us, even the least because, given the right conditions, we could all be a 'frail, old woman' trying to save a son, a daughter or anybody from harm.The cinematography and editing are excellent. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, I think, equal to or better than In Country (1989); Robin Wright Penn, as Audrey, is suitably distraught and uncertain as his doubting wife; Spencer Clark, as David's son, Joseph, is a standout and very professional young actor. And what more needs to be said about Samuel L. Jackson  only that he is one of the most powerful actors ever to grace the silver screen.So, forget about any narrative holes you might see and the fact that the story moves very slowly. The tension and mystery mount inexorably, however. So, treat yourself and your family to a thoroughly enjoyable 106 minutes.",Unbreakable

150,PersianPlaya408,"Solid film, a bit slow, but makes up for it with interesting plot",9,5 July 2003,"Unbreakable[First-Viewing, owned VHS](M. Night Shymalan)- Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat ClarkShymalan's story of a man named David Dunn (Willis) who survives a train crash which kills everyone in the train except for him. A film about supernatural powers and a very interesting look at the relationship of two men Dunn and a comic book enthusiast, Elijah Price (Jackson). After Dunn survives the train crash, Price is convinced that he is a superhero and that the two are exact opposites. Bruce Willis' performance is good, although at times he seems out of it, for the most part he does a good job coming out of his typical macho man type of character, and does well with the role. Samuel L. Jackson was the highlight of the film with a very good performance. Robin Wright Penn was also not bad as Dunn's wife. Spencer Treat Clark is also not bad as Willis' kid, although he is still very young, he is no Haley Joel Osment. Overall a film that was a bit slow, but with interesting story, good characters, good acting and good direction. 9/10",Unbreakable
151,anselmdaniel,Misleading Trailers and Misleading Marketing,7,19 June 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Unbreakable is directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. Unbreakable follows David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, who discovers something about himself after a disaster. Along the way, a comic book collector played by Samuel L. Jackson advises David Dunn.Unbreakable had a poor marketing campaign. This movie had trailers that rode on M. Nigh Shyamalan's previous movie, The Sixth Sense's tone and theme. This movie is not anything like what the trailers may suggest. Unbreakable is not a psychological thriller like The Sixth Sense. Instead Unbreakable is actually a classic hero story told with a twist. The movie is actually a superhero origin story. The movie presents the hero as unaware of his own superpowers until Elijah Price advises him.Unbreakable presents a character that the audience can follow and care about. David Dunn is a great character and Elijah Price plays an excellent foil. Bruce Willis has natural charisma in the role, and is believable in trying to discover his abilities. Samuel L. Jackson has a mysterious presence and he brings out emotions that the audience may not expect.This movie does have some problems. Some of its directing is bland and it overuses flashbacks and subtitles. An example of this is its epilogue where the story continues in text, even when the plot had already reached an appropriate conclusion. There is sadly not a good way to tell the origin story of this movie without the flashbacks without sacrificing its own plot and character motivations.I recommend ""Unbreakable"". Even watching it in the 2010s, the movie does not have common patterns found in typical superhero origin stories such as the Marvel movies. This is an original movie with a great twist.Grade: B.",Unbreakable
152,msbreviews,Rating: A+,10,6 August 2017,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)What a movie! This is one of the most underrated films out there, and it was unfairly compared to The Sixth Sense at the time the former was released. These are two very different movies, but both of them have a lot of twists, which was what brought fame to Shyamalan's films, especially The Sixth Sense.Unbreakable follows that same methodology. It has a lot of twists throughout the runtime, and they are quite diverse: some are very technical twists, related to our point of view of a particular scene that, as it progresses, we always find ourselves tricked (these ones, most people either don't catch them or just don't care ... For me, it's proof of brilliant writing); the others are the prominent plot twists, where something unpredictable happens to the overall story.This movie has all of that and much more. The story itself is incredibly captivating since the main plot holds a lot of mystery and suspense, but these only work as well as they did thanks to Shyamalan, both director and screenwriter. His very unconventional way of storytelling and the anxiety that he's able to convey to some fantastic scenes, elevate the film while delivering a perfect narrative. It's even more mind-blowing the fact that this movie still makes so much sense and it didn't lose its replay value after 17 years!In fact, I bet it would be a striking success nowadays, where the superhero genre is over-saturated. Each year, we get more and more movies following the excessively used genre's formula that makes almost every blockbuster an instant box office hit. Unbreakable is nowhere near that formula, and I genuinely think that any fan of comic-book films must watch this one so everyone can understand what a ""grounded superhero movie"" actually means. M. Night Shyamalan wrote a story that everyone can appreciate, without all of those big CGI fights and overwhelming visual effects. Comic-book fan or not, Unbreakable is the closest to what reality would be if superheroes really existed.Regarding the cast, Bruce Willis probably has his career-best dramatic performance in this film. He's terrific as David and I can feel all of the emotions which he wants to transmit to the screen. Samuel L. Jackson brilliantly plays Elijah, who has a real-life disease which SLJ portrayed beautifully and respectfully. The supporting cast is also worth praising since both Robin Wright (Audrey Dunn) and Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) play magnificent roles as the wife and son of David, respectively.Everyone helped Shyamalan direct exquisite dialogue sequences that extended for minutes without end. The editing and production of this movie are unbelievable ... and it was filmed in 2000! There are so many long, one-take scenes that explain in just a few minutes, everything you need to know about a character or a specific place or event ... Even a full action sequence is filmed in just one-take (the stunt work is also pretty efficient)! The soundtrack is so important, especially in the last act where everything comes to a conclusion. It's inspirational and even epic, I dare calling it. It's just perfect! Throughout the runtime, you can barely notice it due to how subtle it is. However, when it is needed to deliver a new layer of feelings, it always raises the moment.As discussed above, this is a M. Night Shyamalan film, so a very powerful twist right at the end needs to happen ... and it does. It gives the audience an unpredictable perspective about the whole story. I risk myself in saying that it isn't exactly necessary, but the truth is that it makes sense and it does bring the movie to a whole other level, so very, very well done! Finally, I just wish that this film had been released now. It is so much different than what we are used to watching and experiencing, that I dare to say it is one of the best movies inside this genre.Once again, Shyamalan shows the audience why was he becoming one of the most popular directors/screenwriters and proves that his rather unconventional storytelling, unpredictable twists and excellent direction are skills to praise more often. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have great chemistry, but the former has his career-best dramatic performance. The editing, production, soundtrack and even the pacing of this film are entirely flawless, as well as the ending twist that leaves us with our jaws dropped. Unbreakable is one of the most underrated superhero movies ever, but it sits way on top as one of my favorites.",Unbreakable
153,FlickJunkie-2,Shyamalan outdoes himself,9,2 August 2001,"Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with `The Sixth Sense', but he outdid himself with `Unbreakable', a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite. As was the case with `Sixth Sense' and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out. Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (`Pulp Fiction'). Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.",Unbreakable
154,redkiwi,Nonsensical rubbish!,5,14 December 2000,"The closing credits of this film would suggest it is a true story.  I'm very sceptical of that, but if so it's worrying to say the least!Jackson plays a lunatic man who is obsessed by comic books and has had a whole life of injuries and illness, the direct opposite to Willis' seemingly unbreakable life.I didn't really enjoy this to be honest, and it was nowhere near as good as the combination of the two in the Die Hard series.",Unbreakable

A beautiful origin story about a hero who unveils his destiny, and the super villain who comes to terms with the pain in his life. A real life superhero universe where the powers are rooted but at the same time exceptional. The final battle where the hero confronts a masked nemesis and is one of the best battles / rescues in superhero cinema.

Jackson and Bruce Willis give some of the best performances I've ever seen from that.And this is also some of the best direction from M. Night.From the creepy as hell opening scene to the big twist ending M. Night sets the tone throughout all of it and it's fiendishly complex and terrifically entertaining.Back to the twist ending, the ending makes everything that happened before make so much more sense, it's one of the best and most thought out twists ever.And as a story it's amazingly interesting, it can be analyzed and theorized to the core.And I'm gonna give Unbreakable a well-deserved A+.It's really a superhero movie in hiding,",Unbreakable

The story is very character-driven and focused on subtle moments. There aren't action scenes every 15 minutes and it actually works in this film's favor. The twist is interesting, but doesn't detract from the everything that came before it and Unbreakable is strong enough to stand on its own without it.

I thought ""Unbreakable"" was a very interesting movie, and I really enjoyed it.  I thought everyone did a fine job in the film, Samuel L. Jackson was good as always, Bruce Willis pulled it off, Robin Wright Penn was fine, and Spencer Treat Clark (Gladiator) was great.  When I went into the theater I didn't have much of a clue of what direction M. Night Shyamalan was going to go with the plot,  and at first I thought the direction he chose was odd, but as the movie went on I began to like it. Again, all I can really say is, don't expect ""The Sixth Sense"".  Hope you enjoy the film.  -Cortex",Unbreakable

163,saadanathan,Fabulous work by M. Night Shyamalan 7/10,7,10 October 2020,"""Unbreakable"" is a great movie, an original work by ""The Sixth Sense"" director. It's plot feels like it was drawn from a comic book adventure. Bruce Willis and Samuel l. Jackson are a dynamic duo in this classic. Each of their characters have an interesting background and story. What bothered me a bit was that the story felt like an origin story of a superhero: the main character discovers his powers and throughout the film learns how to use them and faces certain challenges. millions of movies that tell a superhero's origin have been made before, so it's no surprise that this plot feels the same. Maybe the fact that David Dunn is a character that things accrue to him and then he takes control of his actions is what makes him different from other characters. Also the character of Elijah Price a.k.a Mr. Glass is an interesting and complex one. The final scene where Dunn realizes the reason for his powers and what Mr. Glass has done all along is a shocking twist only Shyamalan could have nailed, and he nailed it greatly. The movie ends partly in both a closed and open ending.",Unbreakable
164,Spanner-2,Good but not Willis is weak,8,1 December 2000,"UNBREAKABLE [Touchstone]: An interesting follow-up film from the writer-director of the ""Sixth Sense.""

165,jhaggardjr,Good movie,7,24 November 2000,"""Unbreakable"" is writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his surprise box office smash from last year ""The Sixth Sense"". It's not quite as good as ""The Sixth Sense"", but ""Unbreakable"" is an intriguing thriller nevertheless. Bruce Willis once again teamed up with Shyamalan and Samuel L. Jackson (who co-starred with Willis in ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Die Hard With A Vengeance"") to tell the tale of a man who's the sole survivor of a deadly train wreck which leaves him completely injury free. During the course of the film he tries to find out why he walked away from that train crash without a scratch or a broken bone in his body (hence the title). Shyamalan provides another surprise ending for this film just like in ""The Sixth Sense"". However in my opinion there's a big difference. The ending of Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated blockbuster was very effective and shocking. But I thought the ending for ""Unbreakable"" was kind of silly. Still, it's a good thriller.*** (out of four)",Unbreakable
166,Al_The_Strange,Unbreakable review,9,7 July 2013,"Strength is one of the resounding themes of superheroes; they protect the innocent lives around them because they are weaker, and it's their responsibility to use their superior strength for the greater good. Superman, Spiderman, Captain America...they've all learned to use their powers for the good of humanity through various experiences.Unbreakable is a unique movie that does this very same thing, only without superheroes per se. It still draws strong parallels between the world of comic books and reality, building on the idea that everybody has varying levels of strength and weaknesses. Most of this movie is about the main character discovering his strengths, and then figuring out what to do with it. There's no real action to this, but the film maintains interest because it's laid out as a series of mysteries (first, the mystery of the protagonist's strengths, then the mystery of surrounding events). The last act provides the most suspenseful and thrilling moments, but the film overall has a dark and emotional tone that makes it compelling throughout. I almost can't help but to relate to these characters, thanks to all these aspects, and thanks to the quality acting and writing.The story for this is what's most incredible though. Even though it takes its time to get anywhere, it's layered on quite cleverly, slowly revealing the ideas and aspects until the fundamental core is exposed. There is a big reveal at the film's end (customary to M. Night Shyamalan's earlier work, of course), which brilliantly puts the story and characters into a refreshing and smart context. This is also a story that feels very creditable and realistic, thanks to its delivery. Above all, the characters are very delicately and thoroughly well-developed.This film uses very good photography and editing. Acting is strong: Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both deliver very somber and understated performances, which accentuate the mood of the whole film. Writing is good; M. Night Shyamalan's scripts aren't always gold, but with this film, he manages to find the perfect balance between exposition, characterization, plot-building, and everything else. This production uses fairly spartan sets, props, and costumes. The music score is really cool too.Unbreakable is a smart, moody, powerful thriller. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",Unbreakable

Of coarse, there have been 137,428 superhero movies released in the last 15 years or so... Part of what makes it unique is that it doesn't claim to be a superhero film. In a way, Shyamalan tricks the audience into watching a live-action comic book story. Some of the cinematography is framed like a comic book, with drastic angles and colors.I hadn't seen this movie in over a decade and it was better than I remembered. However, since the release of 'Unbreakable' (2000), technology has allowed for some really amazing comic book films that feature actual comic book characters.

168,Angeneer,Shyamalan knows his stuff,9,2 February 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan is brilliant. He's both an excellent writer and director, an extremely rare combination in the movie business. What more can one ask than a compelling, well told story and great camera angles and filters. Bruce Willis shines again (he fits perfectly in Shyamalan's roles) and Samuel Jackson, while deviating from his usual style proves how good an actor he can be. The bad part: A little more development in the end would not be a bad idea, what was with the on screen narration of the aftermath? Too cheap way-out for this movie's standards.",Unbreakable
169,chrisbrown6453,M. Night round two.,8,12 July 2001,"Unbreakable focuses on the phenomenal qualities of its fictitious characters and builds a story around their pursuit toward self-discovery.Perceiving as miraculous the fact that he was the only survivor of a tragic train wreck, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is further stunned by the fact that he experienced no physical harm. A middle-aged security guard and frustrated football player, whose marriage to Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and whose apathetic relationship with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) are about to collapse, David appears to find no purpose to his survival and wanders through life with no definite course. Yet one day, David is unexpectedly summoned by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a character which --it has been initially established-- suffers from a rare bone disease which, since birth, has made him utterly ""breakable"". Now an eccentric owner of an exclusive comic book art gallery with an unclear interest in David, Elijah, who has developed a psychological dependence on comic book heroes and villains, tries to persuade his ""unbreakable"" counterpart to define his severance as an innate, superhuman.Unbreakable explores the events that surround its characters in a slow-paced manner, which toys with the viewer by delivering information conservatively. While David Dunn is portrayed as an apathetic character (seen in its relationship with other characters and enhanced by the actor's performance), the eccentricity and flamboyance of Elijah --which is delineated by performance, costume design, as well as point of view-- renders this character much more intriguing. While Unbreakable relies on carefully stylized depictions to construct its characters' subjective worlds and realities, the film's plot evolves from a simplistic, economic narration of identifiable and realistic events. This complex choice establishes a kind of schizophrenic setup aimed at misleading the viewer and at eventually startling him or her with an unsuspected (surprise) ending. (This strategy was much more efficiently exploited in the director's The Sixth Sense.) Interestingly, the scenes in Unbreakable contain all the clues necessary for the attentive viewer to ""guesstimate"" on a first viewing the total meaning of the film's obscure and puzzling pieces, and to prove this meaning on a second viewing; a choice which seems to point more to a subtle marketing strategy. This trick of testing the viewer with clues while emphasizing the deceiving nature of Unbreakable is quickly established when the young Elijah's mother tries the boy's interest in the unknown plot of a comic book she has given him, by stating: ""They say this one has a surprise ending."" In this manner, the nature of Unbreakable's plot is likened to that of an unread comic book, and its characters, to the heroes and archenemies of the same. All in all, Unbreakable is a film which successfully creates a playful relationship with the viewer, and which establishes the ""unbreakable"" quality of its mysterious premise as a measure for its own effective narrative strategy.",Unbreakable
170,acedj,Masterpiece,10,6 November 2019,"This is the first movie, in what ended up as a great trilogy. I am unsure if that was M Night's idea from the start, but it works. This is the story of David Dunn, not the alliterative name, that is the sole survivor of a train crash. He is contacted by the owner of an art gallery that sells works based on comic book art. Elijah Price, who says the kids called him Mr. Glass is excellently played by Sam Jackson, as is David Dunn by Bruce Willies. These two actors give their respective characters such appeal and authenticity. I digress, Elijah works on convincing David that since he survived the train crash unscathed, that perhaps he is a real life super hero. David begins to believe this and explores what this means.
This is an extremely slow paced movie, but that is ok, this story could not be told any other way. Do not watch this thinking it is going to be like Thor, or Iron Man. This is not for everyone, but rather for those of us that grew up reading comics, but also enjoyed such things as Dante's divine trilogy. This is by far, as of this movie's release date, the best of M Night's work.",Unbreakable
171,AvidClimber,Unbreakable — A super hero on a more realistic human scale,8,2 March 2013,"Unbreakable by M. Night Shyamalan is about making super heroes into realistic human figures instead of modern gods. The idea is interesting, and well exploited. You have a good intrigue, if a slow story, a sprinkle of romance, a bit of action, and good dose of drama. A nice mix with good visuals.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver each a pretty good performance. Robin Wright has a small but well played part. However, the rest of the cast is giving us only an acceptable performance.The dialogs are correct, but they do not bear scrutiny. The score is nice, but repetitive.

Jackson is an intelligent and deliciously evil villain, but draws sympathy (I think this was a Best Role for Jackson and also Willis). This movie has a lot of heart and is a jump out of your seat thriller, everything about it makes it a movie to watch, and re-watch. Full of unexpected twists and turns, which is getting harder and harder to do in movies, as everything's been done to death. But this movie is a great Surprise. Too bad Split and Glass didn't come off anywhere near as well, at best those 2 movies are just average compared to Unbreakable. I guess you just can't bottle Lightning Twice. :o.",Unbreakable
175,dead47548,Easily Shyamalan's best.,9,9 January 2008,"One of my favorite techniques in the film is Shyamalan's use of color contrast, that is very unique to how most directors use it. He uses vibrant colors (orange, red, purple) to highlight the antagonist(s) and uses very dull colors (green, brown, black) to blend the protagonist into the background. It helps to display the films overall theme of someone completely ordinary having the abilities of someone extraordinary. The cinematography itself is very fresh and original. Seeing Willis' conversation on the train through the point of view of the girl sitting in front of him was a great technique. I also liked seeing the scene between young Elijah and his mother reflected off of the television screen. Another unique strategy used by Shyamalan.The performances are some of the best work done by the actors involved. Willis is very subtle and flawlessly melancholy in what I firmly believe is his greatest performance. Jackson is, like the theme of the film, on the other side of the spectrum. Vibrant and extravagant, using great vocal power in everything he says. The film is just full of these contrasts between Willis and Jackson which Shyamalan uses brilliantly. The twist itself is one of the best I've ever seen. It's subtle and extremely unpredictable. Also, the fact that the entire film isn't based on this twist (unlike The Sixth Sense) makes it that much less predictable.",Unbreakable
176,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,8 March 2005,"The follow-up to The Sixth Sense is a much superior film, smarter and more stylish, a mix of thriller, mystery and comic book which sees S.L Jackson and Bruce Willis teaming up once again. Willis is again distancing himself from his action movie persona by making films like these, proving he is a very capable actor. Here he plays David Dunn, the lone survivor of a train crash, with a history of near-perfect health. He meets Elijiah, a man who kids call Mr Glass because of his crippling brittle bone syndrome, and with a love of comics. Elijiah takes an interest in David, and at first seems like a stalker. He wants to prove that David is almost like a superhero as he believes David is impervious to physical harm. He convinces David's son and tries repeatedly to convince David, who claims he has been both sick and injured, and is just a normal man who got lucky. However, David eventually realises others, and at the request of Elijiah, uses his powers to help the weak and defenceless.While the Sixth Sense was predictable, though tried to be atmospheric, and successfully convinced many people, Unbreakable is more subtle and works on many levels, but was a much smaller hit. Shyamalan's style is present here, with floating cameras and contrasts in lighting, built around a twisting plot. Jackson and Willis are equally impressive, and the rest of the cast are good, mainly Robin Penn and Spencer Clark. A highly interesting film worth several watches, and an original take on the typical Comic Book movie.8 out of 10",Unbreakable
177,charchuk,A masterpiece,10,7 March 2007,"I'm rewatching all of Shyamalan's films in order, and this one really stood out and held up well. I've always liked it, but watching it now, it just seemed so much better. The story is simply superb, perhaps slow moving but definitely not boring, and the twist, while not as shocking as Sixth Sense, is perfect for the story. Definitely an original concept that is executed perfectly. The acting, too, is superb, with Willis impressing with his subtle, layered performance and Jackson excelling as a crazed villain that's not over-the-top but as realistic as the film's setting. Shyamalan's direction is simply outstanding, his use of themes and motifs is like no other modern director, and it's only heightened by the fantastic cinematography. The score is one of my personal favourites of all-time, it works perfectly in the film and makes the scene in the train station - the highlight of the film - that much better. One of my all-time favourite films now.",Unbreakable
178,rowmorg,I waited 15 years to see this one,5,15 March 2015,"Is David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a comic-book superhero? He survived a terrible train crash: the only person to do so. He discovers that he has never been ill. However, he is lonely, his life is a mess and he considers himself just a regular guy. Then he meets Elijah (Samuel Jackson), who reveals his powers to him.The film is told in director M. Night Shyamalan's typical style: misty, baffled, episodic. The climax comes when Dunn, standing in central station, picks up on a maintenance man with evil desires, follows him and manages to save two children, although their parents have been murdered. He manages to strangle the perpetrator and to read about it in the newspaper next day.His son picks up on Elijah's analysis and decides to shoot his father, to prove he can't die. That's a dramatic scene. Everyone survives, though. There's a mighty twist at the end that is more or less thrown away with final captions. Shyamalan is a deft hand at creating a thriller, and this film is worth watching.",Unbreakable
179,jetkot,it's a slow burn,8,23 November 2019,The performances are commendable. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are brilliant in their roles.

180,kdnor2011,Kinda overrated,6,1 April 2010,"So, a lot of you are probably asking, why, why do I like The Happening and The Last Airbender more than Unbreakable Easy, its BORING!!! The film is one of the most depressing, unsympathetic movies I've seen. There are maybe two comedic moments, the rest of the movie is just mean. Samuel L. Jackson has a disease that makes it so his bones break easily. Bruce Willis is stuck in a stupid job with a wife he is considering divorcing, and this causes major distress in their son. And then Bruce Willis is in a train accident, and this is all in the first 5 minutes. You see, this is why Signs works, not only is Signs one of my favorite movies of all time (don't listen to Doug Walker), but it's one of the best thrillers ever made, in my opinion. Because it added comedy to balance the horrible stuff that was happening. Like the author of the book being named Bimboo and the fact that they use aluminum helmets to stop the aliens from reading their minds. In my opinion Lady in the Water is Shyamalan's worst because that film also doesn't have much comedy, but that film has other problems. People say the Happening went too far on the comedy, but I think that film had an even balance, for a b- movie. In fact weren't people complaining that The Last Airbender took itself too seriously, Last Airbender had a few more comedic moments than people remember, and there wasn't as much horrible stuff happening, and that movie had an entire race of air nomads being wiped out. Going back to Signs, one of the problems people have is that the aliens were allergic to water, it was their poison, so why come to a planet in which the air is water? Personally I think that's a stupid argument, especially if you like any of the versions of ""The War of the Worlds."" In which the aliens are killed by bacteria, which is also everywhere. But for those people (Doug Walker) why do you defend this movie. Bruce Willis' weakness is water, so since the air is water, why doesn't it weaken him, I'm not saying kill him, but why not weaken him so he is, well, Breakable? Like I said, doesn't bother me, but I know it should bother some people. I'm not going to say the twist ending stunk, but once again, it just depressed me. For a few minutes, Bruce Willis is happy, but then, nope, no more. One more thing, why is it that Willis sees a woman rob a jewelry store and a man rape someone and not do anything about it, I mean he saw that the drug dealer (played by Shyamalan himself), and tried to stop him before this, and saw that man break into a house after wards, so why not stop them. What really ticks me off is when people call this film underrated, I consider a film underrated when when it either doesn't make much money, it gets more hate than it deserves, or people don't talk about it. Well the film made over $200,000,000. It got a 68% and a 7.3, and people talk about it, a lot of people, calling it underrated. Shyamalan was never the best writer (even with Sixth Sense, seriously any one can not say SPOILERS Bruce Willis is dead, but it took a great director to hide that fact), but he is one of my favorite directors. The film overall looks amazing, the actings not bad, the soundtrack kicks ass, and the premise is absolutely amazing, but the story, while still OK is overrated.",Unbreakable
181,Rammstein-2,The first 30 minutes of a movie,6,2 January 2001,"If one made a better movie out of this one, this film would be the first 30 minutes of it. As it is, Shyamalan stretches a good short story to almost 2 hrs and makes it worthwhile only with his excellent direction, a well-written script and memorable characters.Just as in his previous film, ""The 6th Sense"", Shyamalan demonstrates his ability to power-up his scenes with almost nothing at all - no crying, no shouting, no running around. Some sequences in this film are very powerful, and the most powerful of them all is the one left out altogether: the train crash. Calm moments are the most disconcerting. The characters seem pretty dull at first, Willis just seems to stand around looking really confused most of the time. But the awakening to the fact that he is unbreakable, who wouldn't be? Jackson's frail comics collector is strange and esoteric, bordering on crazy. Shyamalan is a talented director and writer, and this movie is good. But I get the feeling that he rushed to make this film, and that the haste has crippled it somewhat. First of all, like I mentioned above, the entire movie felt like the first 30 minutes of something bigger, longer, better. Maybe a part one in a trilogy or something. Second, the nifty little details that were so abundant in ""6th Sense"" are almost completely forgotten or overlooked here. It's as though Shyamalan decided to shorten the process and cut some character development and some trivia. And the film suffers from it - it is not anywhere near as interesting as ""6th Sense"".There's a twist, too, but this one is not very surprising (especially if one has read ANY kind of super-hero comic at some point in life), and seems a bit desperate. But what really sinks the ending are the completely unnecessary explanatory texts that appear, revealing what happened after the story ended for the viewer. I don't understand the need for that kind of self-mockery. It doesn't help the story, it doesn't add anything interesting to the flow of the plot and it certainly feels like a desperate move or some unimaginable sort. I'm not just talking about ""Unbreakable"" here, I don't understand the need for this in any film (except maybe true stories).I really don't think that Shyamalan ""did it again"", since the contrasts between ""6th Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are very stark, and the quality of the former is far beyond that of the latter. But Shyamalan is clearly a talent to be reckoned with. He just has to top his debut, which will be very, very difficult. A challenge, you might say.",Unbreakable

The story was rather flat, it was all a bit too much like The Sixth Sense, the plot was an anticlimax (just like they had to have a different plot for the sake of it) and some scenes are really not in their places.

183,akshatmahajan,Different kind of superhero drama,7,31 July 2021,"This movie is great back to back hit for M. Night Shyamalan after The Sixth Sense. This movie showed us different kind of superhero drama.After the introduction of Mr. Glass, you can tell that something isn't right but the suspense keeps on building and you can't tell what is happening until it is revealed. The most surprising thing about this film is how naturally suspense, drama and horror are blended together. Nothing really felt forced or unnatural in acting, pace, or action.The only thing which I didn't like in this movie was that the ending revealing scene was little bit rushed. Everything happened in maximum 5minutes. It looks rushed. They could have made that scene atleast 10 minutes long.Overall, this movie should be given a try.

184,Mort-31,Rather equal,7,6 January 2002,"An interesting question: If M. Night Shyamalan had made `Unbreakable' before `The Sixth Sense', what would have happened? I think, the world would have praised `Unbreakable', nominated it for some Academy Awards and then said about the second movie: Well, it's almost as good as the first one.In fact, I think these two Shyamalan movies are rather equal. The quality of cinematography, music and acting is the same in both pictures, the story is mysterious enough to hold one's breath for 100 minutes and the ending presents us with a more or less unexpected surprise. Only the fact that in `Unbreakable' there is no fascinating kid, and that after the unbelievable `6th Sense'-ending a more brilliant twist is impossible, gave `Unbreakable' small chance to succeed equally.I admit, the ending of this movie went completely wrong. I don't mean the plot twist, I mean the screenplay and the directing. After I knew the truth, I had the impression, Shyamalan was in a hurry to finish the movie. Suddenly it was over. And showing texts which tell us what happened to the protagonists later like in a true story drama, is a really stupid idea in a mystery thriller like this.But apart from that, I enjoyed Unbreakable`, although I was already familiar with this new` kind of mystery-thriller-drama.",Unbreakable
185,eagandersongil,A different hero,8,25 January 2019,"""Closed Body"" is the film that transforms Shyamalan, it is a cohesive and well structured film, it does not leave the loose ends, has an impeccable direction, a great script and only makes charismatic. The screenplay tells the story of David, a man who discovers himself indestructible and his antagonist Elijah, a man with a network bone structure, loved by the mythology of the hero. Alias, the movie is a source book for a hero movie, but unusual. ""Closed Body"" It has a slow rhythm, but compensates for the construction of the character, also has a soundtrack and a great direction, especially in the game of camera and photography, gray, which led the film as a suspense. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson stage their characters wonderfully well, perhaps not by the acting of the actors, but by the characterization of both. ""The Closed Body"" is a first-line career film that aims to be one of his first films and to be a ""Super Hero"" film is one of his most mature and well-finished works.",Unbreakable
186,tankace,Superhero movie origin story and without knowing it.,9,24 June 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan has become one of the most hated directors and writers in modern movie history and I am agree with that. For equilibrium sake he took Avatar and took out everything that made the series so good, also After Earth and Happening .Yes, as it seems apart from Wayward Pines in which luckily he has the secondary role of executive producer ,his career has gone down hill ,but in the turn of the century and early two thousands he made some very good films , like my personal best Unbreakable.The film came out in 2000 just when superhero flick were making a come back after Batman and Robin (muxc) and Steel and unfortunately was overlooked by critics, although went very well to the box office. To the story, it centers between two characters, David (Bruce Willis) who after an accident ,from which he is the only survivor and he hasn't even a scats(!) starts investigating why that happened and he meets Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) an artist opposed with comic books, who insist that Dave is a superhero.We see the dynamic among those persons be extended to David family and the fall out come after ,bonus Robin Wright and Spencer Treat Clark who played respectively the wife and son of David are fantastic and I was surprised more with Clark who was only thirteen years old back then. His performance is only shadowed by Samuel L. Jackson, who as usually steals the show not with extreme action and awesome quotes but by been so grounded and calm that at times you think that his bones are indeed so fragile as he say.If this flick came out today everyone would loved it and it would be praised for its originality and realistic tone. But sadly it saw the light of day the period before X-men and Spiderman when the audience had lost faith to the capes and cowls. One more fact that the critics did not speak for it, was that its ending (twist of course we talk about Shymalan here) lack the impacted of the Six Sense and immediately the shoot it for that, even though in the story fits like a glove.So go see it if you have not already, if you are comic geek like me then you will praise it after words.",Unbreakable

You should actually make plans to watch it more than once.  The first time to let the story unfold.  The second, to actually enjoy it.It is *not* another ""Sixth Sense"".Now ""the Sixth Sense"" is one of my absolute favorite movies of the past five years.  It was oddly moving, had memorable characters, and an absolutely perfect story arc.  Best of all was the premise.  I have figured out the reason why this is the most popular thriller of all time.  It manages to remind us all (well, me at least; I had a wonderfully overactive imagination as a kid) why we still get a little flicker of dread anytime we're alone in a dark room.  If you don't, you are deluding yourself.There is nothing that primal behind the premise of ""Unbreakable"".  I did get the feeling that there *wants* to be a more universal theme there. 
You see, and I noticed this more on the second viewing, this is less a story of a guy with a strange secret and more the story of as kid and his father. The idea here was so good, I wish it had been the focus.  The moments where this subplot does come to the fore ring the truest (and I'm thinking especially of that beautiful scene towards the end where the father passes the newspaper to his son, the camera pans up, and there is an expression of unmistakable sadness on the father's face).So give this movie a look.

190,jayjaycee,What if superheroes existed?,8,17 February 2020,"""Unbreakable"" is a 2000 mystery drama directed M. Night Shyamalan starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The movie industry is currently dominated by superhero franchises from countless companies, Marvel and DC being the frontrunners in the comic adaptation business. They all produce film that depict pure visual greatness adapted from small issues, in most cases the classic fight of good and evil. Doesn't matter whose side the people are on, both heroes and villains have always been idols and icons for many generations in the past decades and we can't even imagine it will ever change, although we're all aware that they are obviously fictional characters from an obviously fictional universe that would never exist in our own reality. But what if? What if superheroes existed in reality? While films like ""Kick-Ass"" approach this basically abstruse question in a more humorous way, this MNS film explores it with immense seriousness. With the same fascination I felt while watching ""Split"" (who come?) I followed the characters in this mysteriously conceptualised thriller. In this film, the director once again show that he has a sure feeling concerning screenwriting. The film consists of extremely smart dialogues and was executed with ingenious camera work and I once again wondered how it was possible that he seems to have lost this gift in the following decade. Without leading the plot ad absurdum it intelligently unfolds the secrets of its protagonist David Dunn who gradually begins to match the superhero ideals. It's the immensely high love for detail that makes it so magnificent: from his profession as a security guard to a personal weakness he fulfills all of it in a realistic way. It's less a thriller and more of a carefully narrated essay on the possibility of supernatural humans in our society that even succeeds to adopt the colorful visuals of a comic book and combine it with the reality. Willis and Jackson both acted greatly in their third collaboration and really made their characters come to life. It could have been a masterpiece, but there's this one aspect about it that severely bothers me. The film had a perfectly paced build up in terms of tension, but the last third of the film stays on the same continuous level. I knew that film would not last any longer and wondered if something more intense would happen, but no, we only got an plot twist that might have come unexpected, but in the end was an extremely underwhelming conclusion to an at this point brilliant film. It was simply too rushed and didn't do the rest of the film justice, it almost feels like Shyamalan ran out of ideas to creatively round up his own film and it's tremendously unsatisfying in the end. By all means, it's definitely not a terrible ending, but the director's style falsely lead the film's plot into a direction it would not even follow eventually. It's just the beginning of a conflict between good and evil, David Dunn vs Elijah Price and offers no further development afterwards. All in all, this thriller is an absolutely interesting and we'll crafted character study that never loses its serious tone, grips its audience and definitely is a welcome change in the superhero sub-genre, but could have been a masterful work if it wasn't for the undeniable logical but somewhat lazy final conclusion. It could have gone deeper into the character and their development, but ends it just like this instead. After having seen its unexpected successor, I'm absolutely stocked for the third installment of this trilogy and hope it treats the other films with enough respect.",Unbreakable

But it's not your typical superhero film, in execution its closer to the television series ""Heroes"". Like ""Heroes"" a lot of time is spent on the characters background and development with the gradual realization of their abilities. It also doesn't have the nicknames, costumes or gadgets one might associate with the comic book superhero. The film moves at a very deliberate pace that many might find slow but the fine performances and gradual unfolding of an interesting story should make it worthwhile for most.Some of the shots are obviously framed like a comic book though less obtrusively than some other presentations, and as with most of Shyamalan films there is considerable attention to the visual elements and lots of darkness. There is also considerable emphasis on color.Although many have been disappointed with much of Shyamalan's post ""Sixth Sense"" output, I find this film to be on par with its better known predecessor.

The whole concept of creating a ""real"" superhero film is very nicely done and one begins to wonder if Bruce Willis' character really does have superpowers or not, though in the ends things become rather well defined.The villain, Mrs. Glass, however, is rather strange since his ""power"" affects him negatively: it is a disease and therefore makes him a super- weak being.

201,luke-a-mcgowan,"Its clever but not groundbreaking. After The Sixth Sense, keep your hopes low.",6,23 September 2015,"Unbreakable is a fresh take on superhero films, long before Christopher Nolan produced the best and most grounded traditional superhero film to date. It never strays beyond the realms of believability, and is an altogether well constructed film.Samuel L. Jackson is incredible as Elijah Pryce, a man with brittle bones who struggles to find his purpose in life. Through only two or three scenes, Shyamalan and Jackson create a character we can know intimately. It becomes very clear that certain moments in Elijah's life have drastically altered his personality. For a man with one of the most commanding presences in Hollywood history, Jackson plays Elijah with shades of hysteria, patheticness and crushed self-esteem.The same can't be said for Willis, who really sleepwalks throughout the movie. Only in two scenes does Willis actually mine his talent pool to produce anything special. It really sets the movie back when watching Jackson and Robin Wright (also excellent) act their hearts out only for Willis to soberly nod in reply. Spencer Treat Clark was adequate, but after Haley Joel Osment's career-making turn in the previous Shyamafilm, Clark couldn't fill those shoes.Shyamalan's direction is the film's greatest asset. Long takes, highlights on colour, and some incredible cinematography in the film's climactic scene are just some highlights. During one of the opening scenes, while Dunn is in the hospital and a doctor checks him over, a bleeding on the nearby patient oozes slowly and then quickly throughout to highlight the drama of the scene. In addition to some thrilling scenes, there's at least one dramatic scene involving a showdown in the Dunn family kitchen that was superbly written, directed and constructed.The twist ending was a bit disappointing to me. I felt it was far less subtle than its predecessor and it doesn't change the whole film experience but at the same time I found it believable and very much in keeping with the foreshadowing and superhero theme.

204,Dont_let_govt_divide_us,Intriguing,8,24 October 2019,"24OCT2019 {8/10 stars A-} Recommend? Yes; Unbreakable is an intriguing and subtle superhero movie.The movie is a bit slow at times and has scenes that could have been removed without affecting the movie plot or outcome. I really connected with David's sense of duty to protect.I don't like super hero or martial art movies and avoid those genres completely. Both genres skew toward wildly implausible scenarios with even more implausible special effects and action sequences.CONTENT ADVISORY: Elijah (Jackson) is shown falling down stairs when he loses his footing followed by screams of agony from the pain of broken bones, David follows a murderer to the victims house and finds the husband killed, wife tied up and killed and two teenage kids tied up, he frees the kids and they flee the house, the murderer attacks David and they fight in a very brutal battle ending with David killing the murderer.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}",Unbreakable

206,The_Core,Not broken too badly...,7,12 July 2001,"I'm not much of a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films or directorial style. Although I ""sort of"" enjoyed The Sixth Sense in the theater, I made the mistake of buying it on DVD for some unknown reason -- it's impossible to enjoy that film more than once, because the ""twist"" at the end is really the entire worth of the film, IMO.  Once that twist is known, the movie becomes a real bore, and is really not watchable more than one time.""Unbreakable"" fared somewhat better in my eyes, but still lacks far too much.  Like others have commented, the ending is too abrupt.  Although I didn't see it coming, it just doesn't grant the viewer the ""payoff"" they deserve.That said, I believe Unbreakable is actually the better film by far.  I could easily watch it again, knowing the ""surprise ending.""  The pacing of the movie was good most of the way through (I wasn't squirming in my seat like I was during ""A.I.""), the acting was reasonably good, and I didn't notice those funny camera angles like some of the other reviewers here.  To me, the ""problem"" with Unbreakable lies mostly with the ending -- definitely anticlimactic and abrupt (and the text-over ""explanations"" definitely detracted, in my opinion).  The surprise twist is delightful for approximately 10 seconds, at which point it fades.Also, I have to admit that I don't much appreciate the ""light-core horror/supernaturalism"" genre.  Give me The Exorcist, Jacob's Ladder, Serpent and the Rainbow, Fallen or even Ghost over M. Night Shyamalan's watered-down, empty and un-moving brand of ""horror/supernatural"" any day. Anyhow, I give Unbreakable a rating of 7/10 -- and mostly thanks to Samuel L. Jackson's great performance.P.S... I have an almost unused copy of ""The Sixth Sense"" sitting here on DVD that I watched only 1/8 of the way through before falling asleep... anyone wanna buy it?

207,MovieGuy109,Shyamalan's boring follow up to The Sixth Sense.,5,26 November 2011,M. Night Shyamalan follows up his compelling suspense thriller The Sixth Sense with this downbeat and very boring follow-up. Shyamalan spins his wheels with a clever comic book concept that seems to go nowhere. He tries to add a plot twist to the ending but the result is certainly not as good as the shocking ending in The Sixth Sense. There is nothing here other than a concept and a downbeat style of filmmaking that works more as a cure for insomnia rather than a compelling thriller. Shyamalan begins to descend as a filmmaker starting at this dreary film with no real point other than to demonstrate that Shyamalan can rip off himself.,Unbreakable

This film has a very well written plot, characters and a twist that'll shock you to a core. Check this gem out.",Unbreakable
213,Indy-52,M. Night Shyamalan proves he's truly Unbreakable,8,25 February 2001,"Last year, M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense took the country by surprise when its twist ending shocked audiences across the nation, introduced us to the exceptional talent of the young Haley Joel Osment, received 6 Academy Award nominations, and went on to become one of the highest grossing films of all time. Since the announcement of Shyamalan's follow up to Sense, Unbreakable, the country has been asking the questions-""Will Shyamalan deliver again? Will he be able to top The Sixth Sense? Can he create an ending more shocking than Sense's?"" The answer to all three of these questions can now be told: The answer is yes-and with flying colors. A chilling masterpiece of the unexpected and the supernatural, Unbreakable, unlike Sense, will divide critics and audiences alike, but its imagination and ambition is what propels it past the quality level of The Sixth Sense.
Bruce Willis (who also starred in Sense) is wonderfully subtle as David Dunne, who, after miraculously being the lone survivor in a train crash, begins coming to strange realizations after a strange note is left on his windshield; He cannot recall a time when he was sick nor injured - somewhat strange for a grown man, eh? Dunne searches for the identity behind the eerie note he received, and is lead to Limited Edition, a comic-book art gallery, owned by the mysterious Elijah Price (an afro-sporting Samuel L. Jackson). Price offers an unrealistic, far-fetched explanation for Dunne surviving the crash and never being sick: David Dunne is unbreakable, his bones do not break. His cells react to bacteria and sickness in a different way than anyone else. Price on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the spectrum. Ever since birth, Price's bones have broken effortlessly. Price relates these two characteristics to that of comic book characters, as Dunne is just first discovering his ""trademark"", or his special powers as a super-hero.Shyamalan knows audiences are coming into Unbreakable expecting a conventional tale of the supernatural; He knows audiences want a twist ending that will leave them breathless; He knows audiences want a film that will send them back into the theater several hours later to re-watch the film's twists which are reflected in the ending. And what does he do with this knowledge? He, quite frankly, slams it in the viewer's face and laughs at you for it. Unbreakable will undoubtedly leave audiences disappointed, leaving them asking ""What was that all about?"" and most likely stating what a ""rip-off"" it is. Shyamalan knows this. Shyamalan has not made Unbreakable for the mainstream audiences, he has made it for his personal satisfaction, a tribute to comic books. He has made a film that proves a film's advertising campaign does not necessarily reflect the film's true intentions or theme. And ultimately, he has made a film that tells the audience to not walk into his films with any expectations whatsoever, or he will, as seen with Unbreakable, slam them in your face. (And then laugh at you for it.)Certainly not a rehash of The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable succeeds in a way like no other film this year has for one reason: It does not care how the mainstream will react to it. Shyamalan crafts Unbreakable in a way that the viewer is truly unclear of what they're watching-is this a supernatural thriller with a twist ending, or is it a comic-book adventure tale? The answer is not revealed until the film's final revelation, which will leave some with smiles spread wide across their faces, and will leave others scoffing in disbelief and disgust. But either way the ball bounces, Unbreakable is still a daring, unconventional piece of cinematic art. When the credits began to roll, I could only think about one thing: The sequel.",Unbreakable
214,Indy-52,an excellent film...,8,6 October 2001,"bottom line with this film, you'll either love or hate it. Or: you'll either ""get"" it or you won't. You might like it the second time you watch it, as I did. The movie might seem boring at first, but when you think about it you find out it's a pretty intelligent film. It's never really suspenseful, although for a few moments it is exciting when we see David fighting with a drunk lunatic. There is little dialogue in it, and not much happens in the story. It's hard to describe. You'll probably be engrossed and fascinated by the story, even though it's quite slow-moving. It is a sad film: there is no comic relief at any time. If you liked the sixth sense, you might like it, or might not. Watch it and judge for yourself. But it certainly a very good film: that much cannot be denied.",Unbreakable
215,manendra-lodhi,"""Sometimes funny, sometimes brilliant.""",8,9 November 2012,"Opinions kept on changing during the entire time I was watching the film, but finally I believe this is one of the most faithful depiction of the superhero phenomena. No doubt the subject looks a little amateurish in the beginning but eventually you will realize that this was very realistic way to define superhero. The story is about a man who has recently survived a train accident and does not make a great deal of the fact that he has not even scratched anywhere. Later another man points this out to him. And thus begins the journey of beliefs and disbelief. The story definitely lacks the charm of the sixth sense mainly because of relatively mediocre twist ending.PROS:The film in a way explores the rational reasoning about the existence of superheroes. Whatever they showed had nothing unbelievable. People might be there who have never noticed their powers. The beauty of the film lies in being true to the purpose. Comics are an integral part of human life and exploring them in such a different way was truly great.CONS:The protagonist can be called a superhero but do not expect him to break walls or anything based on superhuman power. The expectations set at some times make you feel sad. The hero is discovering his power and that makes the progress and the depiction of the events slow. Sometimes in the middle it looked as if the film was becoming too childish, but a broader outlook is required to understand the purpose of the film.MESSAGE: ""You cannot be sure of everything.""VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",Unbreakable

217,son_of_cheese_messiah,Underpowered would have been a better title,3,26 March 2013,"Imagine a film in which a man discovers he has super powers. In an exciting sequence, he escapes from a violent train derailing. To prove his powers, his son shoots him in the chest. The bullet bounces off. He then goes out on patrol, and in some tremendous action scenes, he defeats some villains. Finally he faces his nemesis in a stunning battle royale.Sadly, all these things happen, but none of the them happen on-screen. M Night Shyalaman seems to have gone out of his way to make the acquisition of super heroism as un-super and un-heroic as possible. The Train crash happens off screen, the son is talked out of firing the gun, the fight scenes are a shambolic scuffle and the final 'surprise' ending the most anti-climatic possible with the actual denouement told in captions.Amazing.There is plenty of time for talk. And more talk. And trick camera angles which grow annoying after a while. There are ambling pointless scenes of the hero frisking an innocent man at the sports arena. Why? It adds nothing and seems only as a lame excuse to shoe horn Shyalaman himself as a cameo.Another tedious and inexplicable scene is one in which Mr. Glass waxes lyrical about a comic book cover as a 'work of art'. Unfortunately the cover on view is the most generic comic book cover imaginable.I cannot explain why Shayalaman has made the decision to concentrate on the prosaic rather than the miraculous in this story. Perhaps he wants to emphasise the 'hero inside everyone. Who knows? But it makes the film dreary and ponderous.Nor can the script be said to be very subtle. Everything is laid out in black and white.

I wasn't familiar with the comic book premise that the film was built on and I wasn't really a major comic fan, however I was enthralled by this one. Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson are together in a not so nice role between the two. Willis' character is a slow moving, but constant and committed man. Almost passionless in his marriage, he is only living, (seemingly) for his son and his job. Samuel L Jackson's character is a wheel chair bound man that seems a bit vengeful at circumstances and the hand he has been dealt in life and (feeling 'owed') by the world around him.The journey starts and gains momentum as Bruce's security man starts to see and feel strange occurrences. Building up and up he starts to sense not everything inside him is what it seems to be. The performances by all were just as they should have been and the story is rounded out nice with a fantastic twist at the end, bringing it to an open ended close. there could be another installment to this darkly defined story, but it should be done right, or not at all.

221,datorsiers2,The definition of mediocrity.,3,20 August 2015,"By looking at the rating of 7,2 i expected this movie to be somewhat decent, unfortunately i was wrong. This has got to be one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. The movie starts with an intriguing premise, but sadly it continues on the high note just for a brief moment. The worst thing is the lack of likable characters in the movie, which just helps to create a sense of boredom for most people.Can't say the movie is poorly made, but with this kind of a story it could have really been an astounding movie. Instead, they chose to lead a good start to slump. David only starts to believe his ''powers'' only when the movie is about to end, so they have only 20 minutes to showcase what David is actually capable of. Sadly, even those 20 minutes were not used efficiently as they only showed David strangling a criminal and saving 2 kids. However, he indirectly killed the parents of those 2 kids he saved, since he saw the parents getting killed in hindsight, however, he chose to wait it out and really see if the criminal is going to break into their house and kill them. A real hero, huh?Samuel L. Jackson was just awful, i am sorry, but he was simply unbearably cheesy, making me cringe multiple times throughout the film. Linking his and David's distinctions to comic books, it did not seem relevant to the story in any way. Just a complete fail of a character there for Samuel L. Jackson, at least in my opinion. Also, the ending is just laughable and completely obnoxious, overall a dull movie with no action.",Unbreakable
222,ryan_kuhn,"""Do you remember me ever being sick?""",8,13 February 2005,"I was never a big fan of comic books, but I do appreciate the style and storytelling that goes into them. My favorite show growing up was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, based on a comic book, in which each episode our heroes face their enemies, but nothing is ever decided. Comic books are about episodes of action where nothing is ever ultimately decided. The 2000 movie by M. Night Shyamalan, his first movie after his surprise smash The Sixth Sense, plays as the first edition of a comic book, where the hero is immune to all ailments and broken bones and a lurking villain who is his opposite. The movie is all about discovery, as Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the lone survivor of a railway accident. Soon after, Dunn is invited to see a comic book collector, Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is brittle and always sick. Jackson figures if there is one man as weak as he, there has to be a strong man who is unbreakable, and he thinks it is Dunn. The meat of the movie deals with Dunn trying to come to grips with the prospect of near-invincibility and ability to ""see"" evil before it happens. The end of the movie is Dunn seeing for himself if he has the power, we learn his weakness, then we find out what the entire movie was about. My only complaint to the end of the movie, I really liked the final relationship between Price and Dunn, is how Shyamalan finished the movie. For those who have seen the movie know what I'm talking about, the final shot is of words super-imposed on the screen telling the audience what happened after the film ends. I did not want that. I loved how the movie served as a first edition of a series, but the words on the screen make it a one-episode series. Nothing in comic books is supposed to be resolved as quickly as it is in Unbreakable. That annoyed me, almost as much as the son of David Dunn, played by Spencer Treat Clark, who was annoying in Gladiator as well. For the most part, Unbreakable is a great movie, and is a great movie if you hit the ""Stop"" button on your DVD player just as Bruce Willis walks off the screen in the final scene.",Unbreakable

I believe that Mr. Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" was one of the nicest surprises of the last few years.  ""Unbreakable"" could have used a lot of reworking.  The premise was fine, but boy what a letdown.  You know I hate it when critics say ""You know if they'd only done this or that it would have been a great film.""  But this is one film where I feel that most of us who felt that it was a weak trifle would have such comments.  I expect great things from M Night Shyamalan in the future.

It is an interesting take on a superhero-esq film in that we're not even sure that is the kind of film we're watching. The twist at the end was something I actually didn't see coming because the director did such a great job of placing our focus elsewhere that we were never looking for an arch nemesis.

226,EddyTheMartian007,The best Shyamalan Film.,9,22 January 2019,"Woah, I was genuinely surprised with this film. The movie follows David Dunn (Bruce Willis) after a deadly train accident where he was the sole survivor, and was left with no scratches. Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who's nicknamed Mr. Glass for his condition which makes his bones extremely fragile, believes that David has abilities, that could make him a super hero. I think the premise is pretty simple, the movie is surprisingly short despite the slow pace. There's barely any action till the end, but I never felt bored. I was just too invested with the characters.Bruce Willis isn't that great of an actor, but he gives one of his strongest performances in this film. Samuel L. Jackson absolutely kills it in this role. I don't want to give too much away from this character, but he's absolutely brilliant, I seriously loved him. All the performances are just solid, even David's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) does a good job.All the superficial aspects of the movie are good or amazing. James Newton Howard's score is beautiful, and I love the main theme. The cinematography is amazing. All the scenes have long shots, with barely any cuts. You just really get sucked in looking at these characters with no cuts. They did some really creative things with lighting and color grading which I really liked. I mean there really isn't anything to complain about the technical aspects.What really made the movie so amazing for me was just how good David Dunn and Elijah Price were, and the storyline. M. Night Shyamalan does a fantastic job of building tension in the story with seemingly simple stuff. I mean he made walking down stairs intense. These characters are just really well developed. We see David Dunn struggling with his marriage, and he's just missing something in his life. Elijah Price's backstory is set up very well, and I was just very intrigued by his character.This movie really deconstructs the superheroes stories. It isn't a traditional super hero film. Like I mentioned before there's barely any action, it's really grounded. Elijah mentions comic books multiple times, and explains these stories. He believes in them, and I think the way they set up the story was very well. There are little hints, and an excellent set up for the finale, and final twist of the film. Once the twist came, WOAH, I mean it makes complete sense.I don't really have too much to discuss about this movie because I don't want to spoil it. If you're not a fan of slowly paced movies, more of a psychological thriller, you probably won't enjoy this movie. If you really enjoy these slower movies, with well developed characters, and interesting themes like presented in this movie, you'll really enjoy this movie.My only complaints with the movie are the finale, and some plot convenience. While I didn't find the finale as disappointing, or underwhelming as other people did, and I was fairly satisfied, it just kind of ends. I mean I felt like there could've been a little bit more in the ending. David Dunn's arc is complete, and the story is pretty much finished, it's not really left incomplete. I just felt like it needed another scene to really finish wrapping things up. Also my other little problem with the film was some of the things feeling a bit too convenient, but it isn't done nearly enough for it to be anything more than a minor problem. Another thing I'd like to add are some things being left unexplained, but I never found it to be a real issue.Overall I honestly love this movie. I think it's extremely well directed, especially with the cinematography. The themes and story are engaging. All the characters are well realized and developed. It has an amazing twist. And despite its simplicity, it really has some deeper and mature moments, and it really breaks down superheroes.9.3/10",Unbreakable
227,Benjamin_Cox,Great thriller let down by a weak story - 57%,5,5 May 2005,"Having had both ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" ruined for me by various people telling me the famous Shyamalan twist, I was left to watch this uninterrupted and unspoiled. By pure chance, it is also the only M Night Shyamalan film I have any interest in watching (the less said about ""Signs"", the better) so I snapped up the DVD without too much debate.Hardly any wonder to find the star of ""Sixth Sense"", Bruce Willis, back but this time as David Dunn, a former college football star and now married to his childhood sweetheart Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and father to Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). But David is not happy. His marriage is failing and his dead-end security job is getting him nowhere. Then one day, his life is flipped upside down after a major train crash. David is the only survivor - indeed, he walks away completely unscathed. Shortly afterwards, he is contacted by eccentric comic collector Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson) who believes that David may have incredible powers. Initially sceptical, David is eventually forced to confront Elijah's theories and ask himself some difficult, repressed questions about himself.There is quite a lot not to like about this film. Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in ""Sixth Sense"" and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves. But the biggest let-down is the story which I found disappointing and not anything like as original as ""Sixth Sense"". But the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised. But at no stage did I ever find myself believing this film and anyone looking for a metaphorical meaning will be disappointed as Shyamalan states from the beginning that this is about comics. I suppose one could say that the film teaches us all to be heroes in our own way but I don't think Shyamalan tells fables, only stories.However, perseverance is the key here. ""Unbreakable"" never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves a terrifically tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves. Willis' hooded poncho standing in the rain makes our hero look like Death himself and I truly respect Shyamalan's ability to show the everyday as being full of symbolism and myth. It's such a shame that the story couldn't be slightly stronger because there is a great film here somewhere and it deserves to be given a chance. It was never going to be another ""Sixth Sense"" and disappointing box office returns scuppered plans for an obvious sequel. After all, the best comic book films usually have much more mileage than studio bosses allow. One needs only to look at the ""Spiderman"" or ""X-Men"" franchises to see how far they can run. ""Unbreakable"" could have been one of them but falls just short.",Unbreakable

Shyamalan had much to celebrate, but soon he was involved with another project: UNBREAKABLE, with THE SIXTH SENSE star Bruce Willis. It became one of the most expected films of 2000 and when it was released... many people that were expecting SIXTH SENSE- PART II got disappointed with the result, because they wanted to see a film even better than the first and a twist even more surprising, and what they got was something very different.In fact, there are some similarities between UNBREAKABLE and THE SIXTH SENSE: the style, the cinematography, the unusual camera angles, the same star, the presence of a boy and the aura of ""a mystery to be solved"". But, even with some supernatural stuff, there are no ghosts that don't know they are dead nor a child who sees dead people in UNBREAKABLE. It tries -and succeeds- to mix two different genres: the cinema and the comic books, in an unusual and melancholic story of a super hero.David Dunn (Willis) is the only person to survive in a terrible train accident. He didn't even had a scratch, what puzzles the doctors and the families of the dead, but he let it pass and continues living his life, until he receives a note asking what was the last time he got sick. This note takes him to a weird man called Elijah Price (Jackson), a comic books fan and collector, who makes David see the truth around him. As a mystery film, UNBREAKABLE is terrific. Some events of the past and some tiny details serve as clues that make David finds out, little by little, that he is a super hero, a kind of ""unbreakable"" man whose ""cryptonite"" is... water, and he has a mission with the society. That helps him to find love in his family again, but some things are not very well explained yet.UNBREAKABLE is a puzzle, but not exactly the kind of puzzle THE SIXTH SENSE was. In the 1999 film the pieces took right to the end. Here the pieces slowly take to a conclusion, but there's still something hidden, what will be shown in the last scene. It's like a jigsaw that you're almost completing, but when you're about to join the last pieces you realize that a single piece is missing. The end was maybe the exact point of disagreement in this movie: some people thought it was great, but the majority thought it almost spoiled the whole thing. I saw the film in January and I still think it was an abrupt, but very coherent conclusion. There's no way to say what I want without spoiling the end, so as you've already been warned, here it goes: UNBREAKABLE has all the elements of a good comic book, so it might have a real villain. As Jackson's character say, the hero and the villain begin as friends many times and suddenly become enemies because of an ambiguous act of the latter. Here we have David Dunn and Elijah Price as two uncommon people, one being just the opposite of the other. The first thinks he is being helped by the latter to know the truth about himself. Well, he is, but not in the correct way. Price/Glass was just trying to find the exact opposite of him, but for that he had to... kill people, create disasters of epic proportions. He suffered all his life with his condition but Dunn/Raincoat can't understand that and becomes his #1 enemy. The condition of hero/villain, bad/ugly is so old as the world, and UNBREAKABLE portrays it extremely well. As in THE SIXTH SENSE, the film wouldn't be complete without the ending twist. It is a bit abrupt indeed, but not arbitrary.UNBREAKABLE begins as a quite cold film, but it started to stay with me as the charade started to make sense. Maybe this was what M. Night Shyamalan wanted, and he succeeds in building a beautiful piece of mystery. The cinematography is terrific and the unusual camera angles make justice to masterpieces like PSYCHO. The direction is great and the writing improves with time. If Bruce Willis was overshadowed by Haley Joel Osment in THE SIXTH SENSE, here he has place to show that he is a good actor, not a great one. The best performances come from Samuel L. Jackson (haunting) and the very talented Robin Wright Penn. Spencer Treat Clark isn't nearly as good as Osment, but he has some future. By the way, he takes part in the only out of place scene in the movie: when he points a gun to Willis- a scene that lacks credibility.UNBREAKABLE is not a masterpiece, but it is a great film. It didn't deserve so many bland reviews and fans of THE SIXTH SENSE shouldn't be so disappointed. Shyamalan's work is original, intense, surprising, suspenseful and even poetic and sweet at times. It was one of the few movies in 2000 that deserved to be seen on the big screen.",Unbreakable
230,Geofbob,Super natural directing,6,3 May 2001,"Generally, I am no great fan of movies involving the occult or the supernatural, unless they are highly stylised like Nosferatu or the Indiana Jones films; so even classics like Rosemary's Baby or the Exorcist tend to leave me cold (with scepticism, not horror). But I've found myself totally gripped by both The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, even though for the most part M Night Shyamalan avoids stylisation, and both movies are set firmly in the real world.For me, the key to Shyamalan's achievement in turning what might have been simply cult films into generally acclaimed successes has little to do with his handling of the supernatural or (in Unbreakable) comic book elements in his screenplays and directing, and has everything to do with his treatment of the characters and of the actors who play them. He successfully performs what should be a basic task of film-makers, but is so often disregarded - he makes us care about the characters. In other words, unlike most fantasy movies, his films are driven by character, not plot. In Unbreakable, by giving David Dunn (Bruce Willis) a down-to-earth job as a security guard, Shyamalan not only exploits Willis's total authenticity in such a role, he makes it easier for us sympathise with Dunn, as an ordinary working stiff whose marriage is on the rocks. At the same time, though he, by contrast, is rich and successful, we also sympathise with Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), not only because of his physical handicap, but because of his poor background, that the director has taken the trouble to show us. He uses the camera, too, to linger on the characters, allowing us time to listen to them, wonder about them, identify with them.
But this care with the characters does not mean that the plot of Unbreakable is neglected; on the contrary, it has one of the most original and ingenious plots of recent years. And unlike, for example, Being John Malkovich, the plot maintains its internal logic all the way through. I believe fans of the occult genre would be wrong to regard the movie's final twist as a cop-out. The ending in no way contradicts or erodes the supernatural element, but simply sets it more firmly in a real-world context. There has been talk of a sequel to Unbreakable, and this might be interesting; but personally I would like to see Shyamalan tackle a non-occult screenplay and movie, using to the full his ability with characters and human interest.",Unbreakable
231,Mickey Knox,I'm still under shock,8,6 March 2001,"Wooow wotta great and unexpected ending :) Don't worry, you can keep on reading this comment, i will not spoil it for you... ""Unbreakable"" is a very good film. M Night Shyamalan proves to every one of us that the great ""Sixth Sense"" was not just an accident, and that his talent is huge.Unbreakable is an impressive story about life, but, more importantly, about heroes. When David (Bruce Willis) survives a train crash in which 131 people die, Elijah (Samuel L Jackson) comes up with an incredible explenation: that Bruce might be a hero. The exact opposite of Elijah, who has a bad bone disease.That's all i'm going to say about the subject. Bruce Willis does a very good job in, probably, his third great role ever, after 12 Monkeys and Sixth Sense. He gives a certain depth and believability to his character, a possible hero, in Elijah's opinion. Samuel L Jackson is, as usual, awesome. He is definetely one of the best actors in Hollywood nowadays. The psychological conflict is strong, giving birth to some great scenes. And, as i said, the ending is very surprising - i never expected that.Maybe the best thing about Unbreakable is that Shyamalan doesn't fall in the ""action"" trap that many people thought he would. He makes a film about heroes and bad guys without any action sequences. Well, only one, even that one short and realistic. Good job.All in all, a great film, a great start for a year that hopefully will be better than 2000.Vote: 8 out of 10.PS Please stop comparing this movie with The Sixth Sense. They have nothing in common one with the other, except for the director and Willis. I read in a magazine, in an article about this film: ""Unbreakable: the sequel of The Sixth Sense"". They couldn't have been more wrong! The 2 films are totally different, and both are great. I love The Sixth Sense more, though...",Unbreakable
232,edicionccq,"""Unbreakable"" is annoyingly slow but I like it!",7,7 December 2019,"A few months before ""Glass"" was premiered, I discovered ""Unbreakable"" in Netflix. The plot was so good that I decided to give it a try.The movie is an interesting take in what I called ""Comic-book genre"" because it has superheroes and villains in them. In this movie, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) starts wondering if he has super abilities after he is the only person to survive a train accident.Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson) will try to convince him he probably is a superhero.The story is actually magnificent. We follow David Dunn in his journey of self-discovering and trying to understand what's happening with her. Simultaneously, we see the problems that he encounters with his family because this is also a family drama.There's a lot to praise about this movie because what it achieves is extraordinary. Except for one slight thing, the pacing is slow as F*. This movie feels too long because it remains 106 minutes but almost 90% of the movie is the self-discovering process and the questioning everything about his life and just like 10% of the comic book action. But all of it is worthy with the ending twist that it's by far the second best of the franchise.",Unbreakable
233,saarvardi,A subtle tale of men becoming what they were destined to be,10,3 July 2007,"After the phenomenal success of The Sixth Sense, everyone was curious to see what director M. Night Shyamalan had in store for us next. The result was Unbreakable, the most original idea for a (major spoilers ahead!) comic book/superhero movie I have ever encountered to date. Even seven years into the future, the final play of this film manages to send these small shivers of joy down my spine.Dealing yet again with humans with supernatural talents, Shyamalan takes his time building his characters (as usual) and slowly introduces us into their downbeat world. Bruce Willis is David Dunn, your everyday Joe who miraculously survives a horrific train crash. Dunn holds a secret: this isn't the first time he walks away unharmed from a near-death situation. Shortly after his media-frenzy survival, he encounters his counterpart, Elijah Price (the fabulous Samuel Jackson, in one of his best roles ever). Price suffers from a rare medical condition which basically comes down to him having extremely fragile bones, which tend to break ever-so-easily. The two men then have numerous encounters which have drastic affects on their lives, but I'd rather not spoil the fun for those of you who intend to see the film.I think what really got me hooked up on this film was the final twist, which was on par with that of Shyamalan's initial attempt (if not better); and the dreamy, subtle atmosphere which sucked you me for the mere sake of curiosity. Bottom line, Unbreakable is a tale of men becoming what they were meant to be; one that leaves you pondering whether your destiny is a matter of free will  or something you can never escape no matter how hard you try.",Unbreakable
234,Barky44,"Plodding, uninteresting, forgettable",3,6 March 2007,"Going way back, I felt ""The Sixth Sense"" was a brilliant piece of film-making. I believed that M. Night Shyamalan had some real talent.I missed ""Unbreakable"" during its first run. I saw ""The Village"", which was horrible, and ""Lady in the Water"", which was at least entertaining.Looking for some signs that Shyamalan was, indeed, a talented writer/director, I reached back to finally watch ""Unbreakable."" What a completely uninteresting film.The real problem is Shyamalan spends so much time trying to make this familial bond between the hero, his estranged wife, and his son, that he saps any possible tension or excitement or wonder out of this film. During most of the film, we just see these three characters mope around. There isn't even any real character development going on here, just three horribly depressed characters shuffling through life.Well, there's four horribly depressed characters, because Shyamalan throws in the wise comic book collector, who's also depressed because he's prone to injury. Gads, there wasn't a single interesting character in the entire film. Shyamalan really fails to create any connection between these characters and the viewer. There's no engagement, no interest, nothing.And without having characters to care about, the rest of the movie falls absolutely flat. In a thriller, you can't have tension if you don't care about the people in jeopardy. And he does a terrible job with the tension he does try to create. There's one completely pointless scene where ""our hero"" thinks he finds a terrorist at a football game, but the guy is just a nobody who gets let go. Where is the tension in that? Yes, there's a scene towards the end involving criminals that's fairly well done, but by this time you've invested over an hour watching uninteresting people, this one sequence is hardly enough to redeem the film.To make matters worse, the Shyamalan-customary ""twist ending"" is so completely uninteresting as to be a non-event by itself. And that was the big climax! 3 out of 10 stars, this film has practically no redeeming characteristics. The score isn't that bad, and the aforementioned criminal scene is somewhat watchable. Not as bad as The Village, but pretty close.",Unbreakable
235,pontus-randen,Another different idea from Mr M. Night Shyamalan,8,30 September 2021,"He sure thinks differently, which is great. Another thing that is great is the cast, solid performers. Bruce Willis basically does the same character as in ""Sixth Sense"": He walks around looking sad and gloomy. And this he does really well!But why Mr M. Night Shyamalan insists on showing his face in each and every movie of his is beyond me. Not that he is a bad actor but it defects the viewer from the story. One is just almost waiting for ""his scene"" and when he shows up one thinks ""there he is"". This sort of breaks you out of the movie and into reality. Which is not what you want when you watch a movie.",Unbreakable
236,C22Man,What if a superhero did exist?,8,29 October 2013,"Where did M. Night Shyamalan go wrong? Touted as one of the best directors of modern time due to his deep stories, ability to get great performances and twist endings. It all seemed to fall apart after Signs and whilst many believe The Sixth Sense to be his best film, in my view it is his 'real life' and extremely underrated superhero origin tale Unbreakable. This is the film that shows Shyamalan's potential in all its glory. Plus we finally get a quiet and sombre look at superheroes, putting Marvel's bombastic and cheesy work to shame. Security guard David Dunn becomes the sole survivor of a train derailment, which he didn't even receive a scratch from. His crumbling marriage and job worries are then put into perspective. David is later contacted by a comic book specialist named Elijah, who has a rare bone disorder, who makes a detailed claim that David might just be a real life superhero. The story is one of the films strongest points and effectively what makes the film so intriguing. That one question of, what if a superhero existed in real life? The detailed and very introspective look at that question through the eyes of two men is what sells the film in my view. The story is all you could possibly want it to be, striking, stylish, gloomy and uplifting all rolled into one intelligent ball. Those who don't like slow films won't enjoy the time taken to build things up, but those who appreciate the craft will be rewarded.Considering how important the characters to the overall story, the acting had to be exceptional to make the characters seem real and thankfully it is especially from the two leads. Bruce Willis seals, for me anyway, himself as a truly top actor as David. He gives an incredibly understated performance that works wonders, his expressions are so powerful that he rarely needs dialogue to get across what he wants. Willis' reserved turn adds layers to the disheartened Dunn that not many could. Luckily his equal is seen in Samuel L. Jackson as the broken Elijah. Jackson also offers a very, compared to his usual work, low-key turn as a man who prays for there to be someone who is the opposite of him. His sombre performance works the same way as Willis' in adding complex layers to the character.The support is excellent which is key due to the main roles being the focal point. Robin Wright puts in a very authentic performance as David's isolated wife. She allows herself to fit into the background whilst remaining memorable due to her genuine and sensitive portrayal. Spencer Treat Clark is equally good, you genuinely feel for him as he is willing for his dad to be special. He showed a calm and delicate presence despite his young age.One thing that really sets the film apart is the way it is shot and how the cinematography feels rather unique. There is an almost saturated view that the film takes on which means that certain colours used really standout, especially blue and silver that give the film an almost comic- book styling. Shyamalan knows how to use the camera with skill as shown by the very slow moving shots which help to create atmosphere and his focus upon the characters which gives us more of an insight into how they feel through their expressions. Certain visual representations also strike me as being very, such as the frequent associations of glass to Elijah due to his condition and the way David's security hood later acts as his 'costume' per-say as both a smart allusions to superhero mythos.Themes play a big part in the films story and the way it presents as well as tries to answer the ideas it sets up is brilliantly executed. The focus being placed on isolation and trying to find a place in the world are developed with a delicate understanding that most films don't attempt to craft. David is presented as a man with sadness hanging over his head and this idea that he might be special is his chance to fit in as he sees it. These also fit the personas of both main characters which gives another subtle comparison between the two. The psychological themes that the film develops between David and Elijah add to its intelligence and insight. Importantly the superhero mythos works as we get references such as David having his own kryptonite and his power of super-strength. The intense scenes are just that. The scenes were David's son tries to prove he is special by shooting him and the confrontation with the 'Orange Man' really does pile on the tension with very successful results. Shyamalan's well-known twist is here and people appeared divided over this. For me the twist was very smart and fit the film well, it wrapped things up nicely and came across as being quite well thought-out. The score is just magnificent and really stands out. James Newton Howard deserves far more plaudits for his incredible work here. It is such a beautifully sombre and moving piece of work that it adds wonderfully to the films already thoughtful nature. Unbreakable is one of those films that is unjustly dismissed and that might be down to Shyamalan's increasingly bad reputation. But, in fairness, if this is your best film then you've done a bloody good job in my eyes. There's so much that the film has going for it, I love the superhero ideals behind it, I love the two leading performances, I love the score and I love the gripping narrative. This is the superhero film alternative for those who want a 'real life' film and those who want a quitter intelligent film. Unbreakable is one of those films that stays in your head and makes you really think, and films that do that are special.",Unbreakable
237,abooboo-2,An Elegant Misfire,8,28 November 2000,"I saw this movie close to a week ago now, and I'm still sorting through my impressions of it. Part of the problem is the inevitable comparison to Night's stunning 1999 breakthrough ""The Sixth Sense"". I've read a number of comments that urge viewers not to make such comparisons, but that's neither sensible nor realistic. It's the same director, the same star, the same genre (supernatural mystery) and both are built around an unexpected ending. To suggest that one shouldn't compare the two is like a car manufacturer asking the public not to compare its '99 models to its '00's. The second difficulty in honestly evaluating it has to do with how so many film-goers, including myself, really admire Night's sensitive, understated, almost religious approach to his craft. The man is really trying to enrich the medium, to elevate the art form (okay, I'm sounding pretentious) in a Hollywood climate of stale formula, empty commercialism and happy brainlessness. I like to think of him as the little guy valiantly standing up to all the Jerry Bruckheimers of the world.So I went into the theatre in a state of great anticipation, tempered perhaps a smidgen by the somewhat uncertain buzz that hovered around the film in the days leading up to its release. And it had me in its grip all the way through its taut, hyper-observant opening on the train, where Night is meticulously extracting the drama and suspense from the everyday (sad, hapless Willis flirting with an attractive young sports agent who has had the misfortune to take the seat next to him) and on through the early passages where Willis is coming to terms with the shocking reality of having survived a train wreck which should have killed him. There is in these scenes the wonderful sense that so many great movies share of seemingly ordinary events slowly building towards something EXTRAordinary.But then the film runs into some problems that are very difficult to discuss without giving things away. The first mis-step (or series of mis-steps) is the repetitiveness of the scenes involving Sam Jackson's memorably obsessive Elijah character explaining to Willis his incredible theories on what he might be and represent. There must be four or five of them and they all pretty much cover the same territory, ending similarly with Willis thinking it over then unconvincingly brushing him off with something to the effect of ""YOU have issues. Now stay away from me."" Another flaw, that has been pointed out in many other comments, is the superfluous presence of Willis' wife played by Robin Wright Penn. There is nothing wrong with her performance at all, and she does figure in a major way in Willis' history and the direction his life took. But as far as the present is concerned, she needs to be pulling the story in some direction, creating some kind of tension or conflict and she never does. I understand that Night conceived this as a trilogy and I'm sure she will play a much bigger role in the sequels (should there be any) but in the self-contained universe of this picture, she is a classic example of under-development.There are other scenes that just don't ring true or are just too ""much"". The gun-wielding scene with Willis' son was wildly unbelievable. (Though some others thought it was laughable, I did find the weight-lifting sequence to be charming.) The flashback where the camera closes in and lingers on Willis as a young man as he is about to make his big, life-altering decision, was mawkishly overdone. And the whole bravura climax where Willis finally accepts his ""destiny"" made me squirm. It held my interest, of course, and I wanted very much to go along with it, but it all seemed wrong and ill-considered.Still, I find myself being very protective when others lash out against it. Mainly because the ending, the famous twist, is flat out brilliant. Not only does it cast everything you've seen up to that point in a whole new light, I LOVE the idea of stopping films abruptly and at an unlikely place, rather than wrapping everything up nice and neat. It makes the film live on in your mind afterwards and, to be truthful, despite its flaws (which I'm inclined to forgive considering all the things it does well) this is a movie that I very much look forward to seeing again. For the all the clues, the symbolism, the exquisite technique, and the rare opportunity to witness the work of a director whose mind is not dead, like so many others, but wide awake.After all, a Night misfire is quite a bit better than a Michael Bay direct hit.",Unbreakable
238,KFL,"Great atmosphere, camerawork; problematic storyline",6,25 August 2001,"While Unbreakable has a number of strong points--the unnerving atmosphere, and some interesting camerawork, among other things--the plot has some logical problems (even if you accept the premise).Can't say more without venturing into Spoiler City...you have been warned.It is hard to imagine a man living thirty-some-odd years before finally realizing that he is, in nearly all respects, indestructible. The Willis character does not seem to be dumb as a brick; why did it take him so long to catch on? For that matter, one would have expected his parents, friends, wife to notice. At the very least, it would have become a topic for conversation; and once noticed, it would quickly have become obvious.The Price character's argument that comics are a kind of popular-culture version of ancient legend, or some such, doesn't hold water. A little help from Joseph Campbell would have been appreciated here.It seems to me that this could have been a much, much more interesting movie. If David had turned out to be, after all, just an ordinary guy who hadn't happened to have ever been sick or injured, and this were revealed somehow in the end (through something as simple as cutting himself shaving, say), he (and we) would have been suitably shocked--on realizing that he was almost fatally shot by his son, risked his life to subdue a murderer/burglar, etc. Many interesting things could have been done with Price's reaction as well.Unbreakable has much in common with The Sixth Sense--great visuals, interesting story, spooky atmosphere, twist ending--but unfortunately in both cases the storyline doesn't bear scrutiny, even if you accept the respective premises.",Unbreakable

As an avid comic book reader, I was quite open to the basic idea of the movie, but by giving the film a very realistic approach, the director lost the opportunity to use the comic genre as he could have. Some of the actions and dialogues of the Willis and Jackson characters therefore simply seem silly instead of fitting into the flow of the story.So all in all though this was an interesting movie, it was way too long and too slow to reach the great quality of its predecessor.",Unbreakable
241,Panterken,A confirmation of Shyamalan's exceptional talent.,9,27 March 2008,"'Unbreakable' is an M. Night Shyamalan (37) film, the born in India, raised in Philadelphia director/scenarist who, back in 1999, scored a world hit totally out of the blue with the marvelous lo fi-horror film 'The Sixth Sense'. And I'm pretty sure about it now, the M stands for magnificent. There are a lot of red threads running through his films; they're all spellbound fairy tales, always beautifully visualized and injected with a religious-philosophical message and the most prominent feature: a trademark plot twist that'll drop your jaw like a drafty shed door during a heavy thunderstorm.His films are so very intelligently written; they never are what they appear to be at first sight. 'The Village' has the look of a mystery/horror but peel away that first layer and what you get is actually a quite beautiful love story. Less skilled directors would've surely taken Unbreakable's premise and cheapened it to action-movie formulary banality but Shymalan carefully shapes it into an impressive character-drama. Contrary to popular opinion, his work does not rely solely on spectacular plot twists. In fact most of his movies are just as good without the end twist. But it is the cherry on top. Shyamalan reminds me of Fincher in that perspective even though Fincher's movies are still a class higher obviously.'Unbreakable' is definitely the one in Shyamalan's oeuvre that shares the most elements with 'The Sixth Sense': the same lead actor (Bruce Willis), the same down-putting atmosphere, again a supernatural story,and again a late surprising plot twist. Some folks will, for that reason, undoubtedly claim that Shyamalan just repeated his success hit, but that statement is about as absurd as 'Pulp Fiction' allegedly being a watered down version of 'Reservoir Dogs'. 'Unbreakable' is on the contrary a mighty confirmation of Shyamalan's exceptional skill.To reveal much of the story is forbidden. An again very timidly acting Willis portrays David Dunn, a somewhat troubled security guard who solely - and without a scratch or bruise - survives a horrible train wreck. The commencement is not unlike 'Fearless' (where Jeff Bridges walks away unharmed from a plane crash), but from the moment Samuel L. Jackson's character is introduced - as the mysterious man who has a very peculiar explanation for David's alleged unbreakable ability - 'Unbreakable' sails in a totally different, more supernatural, direction. The plot itself barely rises above the better-than-average comic book actually, but visually 'Unbreakable' has a lot in common with the looks of an European art-film: just like in 'The Sixth Sense' Shyamalan refrains from showy action, stunts or effects - we're even denied the train crash - but he spellbinds the audience with unusually long, uncut scenes, a dark color pallet, and a unconventionally slow pace, - all very un-Hollywoodian means that provide 'Unbreakable' with the allure of a metaphysic perilous-predestination drama. If Ingmar Bergman would have directed 'X-men', than this is about the result we'd get (the dispiriting confrontations between David and his other half wouldn't be misplaced in Bergmans' 'Scenes from a Marriage' nota bene).And even though Shyamalan's scenario is glitched this time around (it's rather unbelievable that David can't remember whether he's ever fallen ill)), I still can't be anything else than deeply impressed by his mastership: when David hangs up his guard jacket (brilliant scene!) you realize in a flash that the cineaste has always stayed one step ahead of you, that every detail checks out and all the pieces of the puzzle fall into place majestically.

245,haydenluz,Eastrail177: Unbreakable,9,26 March 2020,"Unbreakable, directed, produced & written by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan, aka M. Night, is one of the most underrated, unorthodox, super hero origin stories out today. Coming off his best movie (at that time) in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan decided to embrace the up and coming comic book movie genre, by creating his own take on it. Shyamalan did a great job directing this piece, utilizing a lot of great one shot-long takes, while adding everything he thought was necessary. He told such a brilliantly focused story, peeling back the layers one at a time, backed up with tremendous detail, that got me invested into everything and everyone. I just watched this movie on Monday, but I watched it again today (Thursday) just because it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate it more and more, everytime you watch it!I'm particularly not the biggest Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he did a very good job here. For once, he's very subtle, but the confusion & pain aspect he brings in, makes his character so genuine, and easy to care about. His character development was just the icing on the cake, making it extremely easy to root for him, after discovering everything we need to know about him. Samuel L. Jackson in this subtle, reserved role, worked out just as well. You just care for the guy so much, and you whole heartily felt the pain he goes through. He wasn't always present in the film, but everything was facilitated through him. Robin Wright Penn was just okay. I really didn't care for her performance all that much, being nothing more than a plot device. Spenser Treat Clark was the real compliment to the family. Clark put on a very good performance at such a young age, displaying great emotions.The script was very powerful all in it's own. With the few long take scenes, that's when Shyamalan took the advantage of utilizing his witty dialogue, making it pop. Surprisingly, Shyamalan added a few solid laughs here and there, that kept the film from being too serious.James Newton Howard is a genius with the score. Throughout the whole film, and mainly the last act, he really drags you in, with this deep, somber & suspenseful score.Overall, this was my first M. Night Shyamalan film, and I was blown away by his style! I will be sure to review as much work of his as possible.",Unbreakable
246,paulijcalderon,Somber and powerful,8,8 February 2017,"A powerful movie that I waited too long to watch. I have not been a big fan of M. Night before. I like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", but this one is close to being my favorite. I can't decide on that right now, I would have to watch it a few more times and let it sink in.Jackson and Willis are both great. Willis is especially good when plays toned down characters who aren't too over the top. Here is gives a very somber performance. I felt bad for Jackson's character and I thought the dialogue was written well. The analyzing of what a superhero is and what someone like that could be in real life is excellent. I wish the story went on a little further. It feels like it ends right when you don't want it to.It's a good one. I look forward to ""Split"" now.",Unbreakable
247,bernie-122,Unwatchable,2,11 November 2006,"The interesting thing is that I watched this without knowing it was by M. Night, and the same goes for The Sixth Sense. I never could put my finger on just what bothered me about the latter, but now I know. Both of these have a lot in common with The Village, which I thought should be marvelous, but after it finished, I felt cheated.I like Bruce and Sam can do no wrong in my book, but neither of them could save this. The whole production seemed to be deliberately aimed at irritating the viewers. Accordingly, I am just dumbfounded by the huge number of rave reviews here. Why can't these people detect a bad film when they see one? Not to say it couldn't have been good. The idea was original, just really badly executed, IMO. Just as The Village could have been good. Really, Sixth Sense wasn't that bad, so maybe M. Shyamalan should have stopped after that one and just been a one-hit-wonder. Maybe he should go back to Bollywood; they're desperately in need of good ideas. How they can just keep stamping out the exact same kind of movie over and over is just beyond me.Anyway, if you haven't seen Unbreakable yet, take my advice and don't bother. I wish I could unsee it.",Unbreakable
248,thehumanduvet,"Intriguing, quiet follow-up",8,18 June 2001,"Good stuff from Shyamalan and Willis, following up their Sixth Sense smash with an equally subdued, whispery sort of film with an even more intriguing set-up. Riffing around comic book themes and investigating the form and style of the comic itself, the story follows Willis from everyday Joe living a greyed-out kind of life through some startling revelations from a frighteningly fragile Samuel L Jackson, leading into a look at how the creation of a superhero might work out in a more realistic sort of world. While the final pay-off is less shocking and ingenious than the end of Shyamalan's previous effort, this one doesn't need the surprise ending so much to make it work, having provided enough interest and food for thought in the main body of the film that the little twist in the tail is just an added extra rather than the point and focus of the picture. If he can keep turning out work of this quality, and keep innovating and surprising, Shyamalan will probably be king of the world in no time.",Unbreakable
249,kylehodgdon,"Good Idea, But It Never Really Delivered",5,18 November 2009,"""Unbreakable"" is a very mediocre film. I loved the idea for it. The concept of these two people having superpowers and the means that they go to discover them makes for an interesting plot, but the movie itself does not end up being as good as I hoped that it should have been. This film seemed to be a bore for me. I did not care for Jackson's character and I can't say that I was too fond of Willis' either. The fact that Elijah is the culprit of the accidents and is the villain to David, the hero, is something else that would seem to be a good twist, but it doesn't really come off that way. Instead I kind of found myself not to really care.I wish I could see the same idea for a film, but to instead use a different plot and different director. I think ""Unbreakable"" had a lot of potential, but it just never found its rhythm. If someone asked me whether or not they should see this movie, I'd tell them to pass.",Unbreakable
250,btm1,Unbreakable is barely bearable,1,28 March 2009,"Some other reviewers have compared this to the ""Sixth Sense,"" an earlier movie starring Bruce Willis. The problem is that the writer and director of the Sixth Sense knew what their story was about and developed it beautifully. This is not the case with ""Unbearable."" The director put together a film that is dark, dreary and slow paced, with an irritating omnipresent dirge as the sound track. The story is disjointed, confusing and unbelievable. I mean at times I thought it was supposed to be some avant garde surreal or experimental film, where everything is some sort of symbolism. I usually don't get what the director is trying to say in those modernistic movies. Unfortunately, ""Unbreakable"" was not that good and no easier to follow.Bruce Willis plays a security guard with a wife and child that he is apparently simultaneously estranged from and living with. In college he had a promising football career until he and his wife (its not clear whether they were married yet) were in an auto accident that ended his football career. Most of the movie is spent with his son and Samuel Jackson (playing the security guard's polar opposite, a brittle boned and accident prone comic book collector, trying to convince the security guard that he is really supposed to be a superhero.Eventually he is convinced to spend an evening as a kind of vigilante looking for some evildoing to thwart, sort of like a neighborhood watch volunteer who goes on patrol with no cell phone to call 911, no flashlight, and no weapon. We are shown a brief sequence of crimes that he ignores. In addition to being ""unbreakable,"" he is apparently unwittingly psychic and gets some idea of who is thinking about a criminal act. At about that time we hear one of the family say something such as ""at last its over."" I hoped that was the final scene but no such luck. There is a final twist which apparently we are somehow supposed to figure out from newspaper clippings on a wall. It is clear from his horrified facial expression that the security guard understands the twist and then lets the audience in on what the clippings mean.The only reason I didn't shut this off before it was finished was I had invested time watching it and wanted to at least learn where the director was going with this. What a waste of good actors!",Unbreakable

Then I saw it 10 years or so later when it came out on bluray and thought it was even more compelling. Now, though, post-Marvel and later and knowing more about film craft, I can really appreciate this for what it is.I would not change a single thing about this movie.The script is fantastic. It has so much more interesting things to say about super heroes, about comics and art, and its roots in mythology; about story telling and how it is communicated on multiple levels. It's paced perfectly. It should able to speak to anyone, I feel.At a technical level though, this is so under appreciated. The quality the camera takes on with the different points of view is excellent. Every shot composition is perfect, or close to it. The acting is really great, somehow getting an amazing performance out of even Willis. The colour, the wardrobe. I cannot think of a simple aspect of this thing I'd change.",Unbreakable

254,ween-3,NIGHT FALLS,5,9 December 2000,"Uh...let's see. Now I'm sure I saw this before...Bruce Willis...M. Night...a kid..hold on, now...lemme think...oh yeah...This sequel to ""Sixth Sense"" should be renamed ""No Sense"". Completely devoid of anything that could be reasonably termed a ""plot"", Night starts us down the road to nowhere about 14 different ways and then leaves us without any payoff. And the ""surprise"" ending ain't no surprise, either. It's what your 8th grade English teacher used to call a ""deus ex machina"". For those of you who don't remember your elemental Latin...it basically means that the author doesn't have any rational way to end his story, so, instead, everybody gets run over by a big monster truck. The end.And this movie moves slower than ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Never thought I'd live to see it happen. For a reasonable facsimile of the pace of this movie, I suggest putting glue in a bottle of Heinz ketchup, allowing it to sit and emuslfiy for 4 or 5 days, and then attempting to pour it over soggy french fries. Trust me. It'll be more entertaining than the movie.On the plus side (and I'm really diggin' here, guys) there's some nice moody cinematography. And Bruce decided to forego the hairpiece for a change. That's almost worth the price of admission.As for my pal, M. Night, here's a suggestion--try directing one that you DIDN'T write. That's why they have writers. They write stuff. Sometimes it's good stuff. No need to wear all those hats. Go out and buy some of their stuff next time. They need money, too. And maybe another actor, just for fun. I mean, this ain't exactly a nascent Scorcese-De Niro relationship, Sparky. Let's can it while the going's still good.To the vast numbers of you who loved this film...and I know who you are... I got some old ""Green Lantern"" and ""Flash"" comics for sale on Ebay.

The twist was decent, but there wasn't time for the impact to really settle in.",Unbreakable
256,Ky-D,An un-super superhero.,6,21 August 2005,"I gave credit to M. Night for trying to tinker with the comic book movie formula and trying to give some more credence to the sub-genre. Howver, in his attempt to mature the film, he has stripped away most all the things that make people like comics.After a train wreck, a single man (Bruce Willis) walks away, not only alive but completely unharmed. He is tracked down a mysterious man (Sam Jackson) with a fetish for comics. It seems the mystery man believes he is a superhero, indestructible. How does a man believe the impossible in a world that is so monotonously real? The film suffers from the outset. What is the most boring part of a superhero movie? The origin; that's the part we all have to put up with before we can finally see the hero doing super things. Most superhero films cover that part of the story in the first half-hour or so and then movie onto the good stuff. Now imagine an entire film of origin, a film that ends just when it should be getting started.This issue is exacerbated by M. Night's employment of uber dark and dreary settings and locations and the horrendously slow pace of the film.Story wise the film doesn't fare much better. We all know he is indestructible, we want to watch him act indestructible, but instead we are forced to sit through 2 hours of him trying to figure this out. Which brings up the subject of plot holes; you want me to believe that he has never been sick, had a cut or broken a bone and he has NEVER taken notice of this. He's a middle aged man for god's sake! Oh, but he has noticed that he has some kind of strange ESP that lets him see what people are doing wrong. Curious...The acting is alright for the most part, but Willis' character is written to be kind of stupid and there is no way to play an slight moron intelligently. Jackson fares better as the creepy comic geek that may have read one issue to many.I again pass credit for trying to do something different with something familiar, but this just wasn't the right thing to do.6/10",Unbreakable
257,mitchell5954,Shyamalan's Best and Most Underrated Movie,9,25 January 2019,"Unbreakable, I find to be an underrated M. Night Shyamalan film. I find the Sixth Sense to be slightly overrated, I find this film underrated. People are mixed about this film. Some love it, some hate it. I admit when I first watched this film, I did not really care for it. However, as I viewed it again and watched people's reviews on it my opinion changed. I think this Shyamalan's best film. I personally enjoy this film more than Sixth Sense and even Signs. I am a fan of superhero films as well. I like that this is a new take on superheroes at the time.The movie revolves around this man named David Dunne, played by Bruce Willis. There was a train crash where no one survived but him. Later you find out he is basically unbreakable. You also have Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a character named Elijah Prince a.k.a Mr. Glass. He is essentially the villain to Bruce Willis. He is the one who tells David about his gift. He might be one of the best villains in superhero movies.The acting is good all around. I think Bruce Willis does a better job here than in Sixth Sense. I really like his dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's character. My favorite scenes of the movie are when those two characters are talking to each other. The other characters are alright, though I personally found David's wife to be annoying at times.The film has amazing atmosphere, which is one of Shyamalan's strengths as a filmmaker. The direction cinematography is great. Some of the ways he shoots a scene, from the way he frames a shot, to how he positions or moves the camera in certain segments made for a very unique experience you don't normally get in big Hollywood films. However, I could forgive it because this is supposed to be a darker and more realistic take on a superhero. I also really like the theme of destiny that is played up in this film. In this film, unlike in most film, destiny is played up as not such a good thing. I'm not a fan of the destiny theme in most movies, but here I think it's done right.Overall see this movie if you haven't already. It deserves at least one viewing. It is easily Shyamalan's best film.",Unbreakable
258,Keyser Soze-12,M. Night Shyamalan is a genius,8,2 December 2000,"Unbreakable is a strange movie to love.  The film's plot is so ridiculous that it's laughable.  If this plot had been thought up by anyone but M. Night Shyamalan this would have been a bad movie.  But, M. Night Shyamalan wrote, produced, and directed this so the movie is in good hands.First off, if you haven't seen the movie before, stop reading these reviews now!  Turn off your computer and don't watch Access Hollywood.  Not only the ending is a surprise, but the plot is one too!  I'm not going to give it away though.  whatever you thought the movie was going to be about in the trailer, THIS AIN'T IT!  I mean that in a good way.Well, I always give the bad with the good, so here it goes.  The ending seams rushed.  When I say ending, I mean the VERY ending, right before the credits role.  Don't stop reading, I'm not giving anything away.  At the very end of the movie there are these (for lack of a better ""technical"" term) sentences which describes what happens to each character after the movie.  You've seen this in many movies, often movies based on true stories. But, I found them annoying and unnecessary.  They take away the fun of the movie!  It's not what they say really, it's just that they're there.Another small, small, picky problem I have is the movie is a bit dark and shaky.  It may have been my local theater, but the movie seemed to shake a lot more than it should have been.  And it is shot in dark colors, which isn't a bad thing but it does get hard to see things sometimes.Okay, some more good points about the movie.  Oh, I love the plot.  I found this movie very intriguing and interesting.  I love Elijah theory of ""Everything fiction is made with some truth"".  I love it because I had the same idea!  I didn't involve this, but it was close.  Also, the acting is brilliant.  I love Sam Jackson.  The man does it all.  And Willis is really good in this movie as well.   The supporting cast has done a great job too.Well, it all comes down to one thing, really.  Was it worth $7.50?  Yes,  oh my yes.  It's worth much more than that.  Drop what you're doing now and go see this movie, even if you've seen it before.  It's an interesting movie that is fun and entertaining.  The twist ending isn't as big as the one on The Sixth Sense, but it's a cool twist nun-the-less.  I just hope M. Night Shyamalan doesn't screw this up with Unbreakable 2 and 3 (which should be great sequels because this movie was just a setup for more movies anyway... IN A GOOD WAY!)But I'm pretty confidant that Shyamalan, Jackson, and Willis are professionals so and won't mess up this great, terrific, strange, intriguing, masterpiece.8/10PS: to those who have seen the movie, I love that poncho idea.

Can you deal with that.  Don't expect the same movie.  A lot of the other reviews say, ""The ending wasn't as satisfying as The 6th Sense"".  Well, this isn't the Sixth Sense.  Did you people even notice that the plot was completely different from the first film?  I mean, just because Ridley Scott directed Gladiator that doesn't mean Hanniabl is going to have Gladiators in it.Well, enough complaining.  I will admit that the film is too slow.  I don't want action.  This is no action movie.  But some peppy music every now and then would be nice.  This is not for people with short attention spans. This movie was made for people who want to sit down, relax, and sit through an intriguing little movie.And Honestly, I DIDN'T THINK THE SIXTH SENSE WAS THAT GREAT ANYWAY! I mean, the only good part was the ending, the rest of the film was just ""okay"". You can't enjoy the Sixth Sense a second time.  The fun of that movie is all in the ending.  Unbreakable is meant to be enjoyable all the way through, instead of relieing on a twighlight zone ending.  I have considered giving Unbreakable a 7 out of 10, but I loved it so much.

264,dalton2,Unbreakable broke my hope on Shyamalan,5,1 September 2001,"It's been several months since I saw this film. Shyamalan's first work was really impressive to me. I even compared him with Stanley Kubrick. But now I must take that back. It was just an illusion. The Sixth Sense by itself is a masterpiece, but this second work from M.N.S. is horrible. This film is something like trying to make a work of art from a pile of trash. I never liked comics very much, I must confess, but this is too much for me. How can a comic be mixed with reality without stating (as Superman, Batman, etc. do) that it's just a comic, not reality? This film does a sort of trying to make us believe that comics are something real, in the same mood that Stargate tries to make us believe that there was a civilization from outer space in the Egyptians' time. This second premise is of course much more consistent and it's well developed.Technically, the film has no flaws. The cinematography is quite good, the music is acceptable (although not good), and the acting is correct (not good, either). But the idea behind the plot is simply impossible. In my opinion it's something unbelievable under any circumstances. And this second cameo from Shyamalan really annoyed me. Does he think he's Hitchcock...?

265,shaid,Uneven,1,29 January 2001,"""This review may contain a spoiler""First a complaint to the marketing peoples at 'Disney'. Presenting the film as a sequel to 'The Sixth Sense' is a big mistake because everyone expect something like that film and when they don't get that they become disappointed with the product.Now that I said that to the film, which I enjoyed very much. I liked the slow pace of the film. I liked the fact That M. Night Shyamalan took its time to tell the story and I found myself relating to the story very much and here is the second problem of the film. If you want to enjoy it you have to accept and believe in some of the things it tells you. i.e: that the world is a place where good and evil fight each other,all the time,that everyone needs hope in a world that have little hope to offer,in order to keep on living. If you can accept what the film says you will enjoy it more,if not than you will not like the film at all. I had also problem with one of the scenes and I'm talking about the scene where Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark) try to shoot his father David (Bruce Willis). The scene was ridiculous and everyone involved were acting over the top which was not in tune with the rest of the film. Bruce Willis & Samuel L. Jackson were excellent and the interaction with one another was superb.I recommend this film though it's not a perfect one, and again ignore the fact that it's been marketed as a sequel.This is a completely different film.April 2007:The review above has been written 6 or 7 years ago.I have just watched the film again and I can not believe I have liked it.This is a very pretentious film.A much a do about nothing.Characters who talk and act in clichés.A script full of holes and a film which is shot in the wrong angles.

Instead I found a slow-paced movie that I kept waiting for something occur. Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard, who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.Samuel L. Jackson is the opposite in that he was born with incredibly weak bones and goes through life constantly in and out of hospitals with fractures. His one solace in life is comic books. Jackson is obsessed with finding his opposite and he does this by looking for survivors of disasters. He seeks out Willis, who is the sole survivor of a train wreck. We later find out that Willis has never been sick and he may have survived some other disasters as well.You keep expecting Jackson to ask Willis for a bone marrow transplant or some other type operation to strengthen his bones but Jackson's motives are inspired by the comic books that hold his fascination.The director seemed to miss some opportunities in the movie. We have a scene at the beginning, where Willis tries to pick-up his female seat mate on the train and then after the train wrecks, we know that she is dead so you later expect something more out of Willis and his feelings.Jackson also comes off as a loony throughout the film and you wonder why Willis ever talks to him at all.There is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print. At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4-year-old son (who obviously would have no sense as to the value of the print). This infuriates Jackson enough to throw the man out of his store without selling him the print.",Unbreakable

I won't say who it is, because you're just going to have to see it. And please do, I recommend it.",Unbreakable
270,darkjosh,Unbreakable Breaks Fresh Ground,9,29 November 2000,"M. Night Shaymalan's follow up to his masterful Sixth Sense may not be as tightly-wound, but it's still certainly a fresh, innovative, mysterious thriller with what seems to be becoming the director's trademark: a fantastic ending.When Bruce Willis (in a somewhat muted performance) is in a disastrous trainwreck, he is the sole survivor and is tracked down by Samuel L. Jackson, whom suspects he might know why Willis survived unscathed.Shaymalan directs with the same eerie restraint he incorporated so well in Sixth Sense, and sometimes the silent stretches that have no dialogue overshadow the regular scenes.  Bruce Willis' quiet performance is contrasted by Samuel L. Jackson's decidedly determined, obsessed character, the same way Willis' deadpan doctor in Sixth Sense was overcome by Haley Joel Osment's intense supernatural child.Also, Shaymalan does not forget to make us sympathize with his characters plights.  Willis' scenes of emotional estrangement from both his son and daughter and the small splashes of intermitten bonding are deeply heartfelt. The same goes for Jackson's scenes with his mother which evoke sympathy. 
Unbreakable's cinematography is also effective, serving the workings of the script, framing each shot as if it were in a box.  While the film has an overcast look to it, there are scenes lit beautifully to contrast the overall grey blandness.With Unbreakable, M. Night Shaymalan proves that his masterful handling of Sixth Sense was not a fluke.  Great storytelling, good performances, and a mysterious setting peppered with some affecting though small bits of comedy all come together in a wholly original, involving thriller.8 out of 10",Unbreakable
271,emfern13,WOW,9,15 April 2002,"Unbreakable is one hell of a movie. Shyamalan can make movies. In this movie he proved that the 6th sense was no fluke, which i think was screwed out of best picture. Unbreakable is based entirely on a comic book which is very clever. The ending was a big shocker, about as shocking as the 6th sense's. Great Performances too. It is not as good as the 6th sense but it is very good.",Unbreakable

That would have just fit into the theme, and would have been really cool. But this movie just stays philosophical, even more than 'The sixth Sense'. Additionally, I liked the end far less.Overall, this wasn't really a necessary movie, and left me quite unhappy.

274,michaelgarykelley1994,"Solid, Fun, But Lacking",6,19 January 2019,"You know, I had heard so much about this film, a couple of years ago, I was excited to finally watch it. I didn't remember loving it, when I finally did see it, but I remembered thinking it was just fine, for the most part. Well-made. Interesting. Engaging.For Christmas, I bought my mother the film on DVD, because she adored ""Split"" (as did I, mostly). We just watched the film today, and we both enjoyed it, but I think we both agreed that even though the filmmaking was very, VERY solid, the ending is immensely unsatisfying, due to the lack of a real climax. Many people, I believe, try to argue that the lack of a real, more mainstream climax is due to the arthouse-y vibe ""Unbreakable"" carries throughout its runtime; meaning that it's supposed to be more unique than other superhero films. I understand that argument, but I do not agree with it making the film more special. That's like arguing that the sequel trilogy in the ""Star Wars"" franchise is exceptional because it has Kylo Ren's crossguard lightsaber, which we hadn't seen in any of the films up until ""The Force Awakens"" was released. It's an odd argument for uniqueness.The cinematography and score are exceptional, here. Very impactful.The writing, in total-dialogue, scenes, showing-instead-of-telling-is wonderfully unique, and really gets a thumbs-up from me, outside of its lacking finale. There's some quality work put into every angle of this film. Again: that random twist in the finale is good, but to just end it immediately after the reveal is lame, and I think it ruins the tone of the whole flick, overall. I'm not much into fan fiction, but I can't help but to wonder what I myself could've done to make a more profound, impactful ending. I have a few ideas, frankly, but I won't give them here, because I don't discuss spoilers, in my reviews.The performances from everyone-even Willis, whom seems like he could care less, nowadays, no matter what he's a part of-are exceptional, too, even though I think some things are a little too much for me, when it comes to Sam Jackson's character, whose bones break easily, due to a disease he was born with. The opening to the film, revolving around his birth, is truly horrifying, even for someone like myself, who's not a parent, at the moment. I also would like to give a special mention to the young man who played Willis' son, in the flick. That kid can act, and I'm very excited to see him again in ""Glass"", which my mother and I plan to see, tomorrow evening.Say what you will about Shyamalan and his career's more up-and-drastically-down bumps, but the man KNOWS how to tell a story, most of the time-no matter how unsatisfying it can potentially end-up being.I'm glad I had the chance to see this again before the newest film. It's a fun watch, and I'd recommend it to you, if you haven't seen it, due to the uniqueness it has, but don't rush into this, excited about the many things you've heard, or it will probably be more than guaranteed to disappoint you. At least, that's how I've felt after seeing it both times, with so many years apart for myself to grow, in my love for movies.",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan's next movie after ""The Sixth Sense"" were extremely high and ""Unbreakable"" did not let me down. In fact, in some respects, it is a better and more self assured movie than the former. Like ""6th"", ""Un"" is a movie that the less you know about it going in the better it is and I'll be damned if I'm gonna give anything away here. However I will say that Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (has this guy ever given a bad performance?) are outstanding as the leads. There is not a wasted role in the movie. Shyamalan has concocted another fantastic tale set against urban reality. The spirit of Rod Serling lives in him. His direction and writing are a synergistic blend of moods and spiritualism that resonates deep within your emotions.  He is aided greatly by James Newton Howard's brilliant score and Eduardo Serra's daring cinematography. This movie takes more chances than ""6th"". You either buy it or you don't. It has a dream logic that never sacrifices narrative thrust. ""Un"" doesn't benefit from ""6th""'s shock value, but I think is a more accomplished piece overall.

These guys teamed up in Die Hard 3 and that turned out to be adventurous, action packed and worth watching, but this didn't live up to a decent story line. There is in total one action scene and even that was a disappointment, but to hear Samuel L. Jackson constantly rave on about comic books, heroes and villains,it just got on my nerve!

280,Critical Eye UK,Broken (Rating 2 out of 10),1,24 December 2001,"SPOILERS AHEAD: With what should hopefully be a long and illustrious movie career still ahead, an early-days setback like Unbreakable shouldn't do lasting damage to writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's reputation. A pity, though, that the one responsible for Sixth Sense should have rushed (or been rushed into) this vacuous clunker, a movie that would surely never have found production funding nor distribution had it not been for the bankability of its predecessor.A back-of-the-envelope job at best, Unbreakable is so burdened with the weight of its own self-perceived significance that what starts as a mildly intriguing probe of superhero mythology runs out of track faster than the train wreck from which Bruce Willis miraculously escapes. Thereafter, its déjà vu all the way, and not only because Willis is as animated as a rivet: the film's look is so saturated (literally) with Se7en atmospherics that it's a wonder they didn't re-title this Unbr8kable.But Willis, justifiably catatonic in Sixth Sense, can't be blamed for playing it in identical fashion here. After all, if you're on the verge of discovering you're the Caped Crusader, then furrowed brow and hushed tones are probably par for the course.If one is charitable, Willis's casting is a deliberately ironic nod in the direction of his string vest Die Hard persona. Then again, and rather less charitably, explanation might be thought to reside in a fast-buck dash to the bank by all concerned with Unbreakable -- a suspicion reinforced by the formulaic reprise of Sixth Sense elements, including an introspective Willis, a small boy, supernatural overtones and, most blatant of all, a 'twist' at the end.With virtually nothing to do for most of the movie -- indeed, virtually nothing at all happens in most of the movie -- Willis has only one real and two ersatz characters to play against, respectively his wife (Robin Wright) and his young son (Spencer Treat Clark) and The Mysterious Mister Glass (Samuel L. Jackson.)Angst, alienation and ambiguity hallmark the relationship with Mrs Caped Crusader, and if that's what you fancy for a fun night out well, good for you: after all, there are some people who think The Ice Storm is a masterpiece, too.But whilst there's a narrative logic for The Longsuffering Wife's existence, no such justification attaches to The Small Boy. We've been there, seen it, and got the T-shirt, and a half century on there's still very little in cinema to match the power of Shane -- certainly not Unbreakable, where hand-me-down theming results less in 21st Century drama as 19th Century melodramatics, culminating here in a Small Boy points Big Gun at Heroic Father scene that's as daft of concept as it is inept of execution.For God's sake, you're thinking. Pull the bloody trigger and then we can all get home early.But no. Willis lives to meet Samuel L. Jackson again, and Jackson lives, cinematically at least, long enough to prove that his current knack of picking losers remains undimmed.Having headlined Rules of Engagement, a movie so dire it even needed an explanatory end-credits text roll to rescue the script, here's Jackson in yet another movie that does the same thing, albeit the post-narrative text here might have been excusable had it been revised to read: `Bruce Willis was found guilty of excessive gravitas, Samuel L. Jackson was found guilty of wearing a Very Bad Wig, and both were sentenced to appear in the next film to be directed by Clint Eastwood.'Given the rehashing of Willis, Small Boy, and supernatural from Sixth Sense, a twist at the end of Unbreakable was bound to be shovelled in. Unfortunately, one can only be surprised by something credible, or half credible, and that's certainly not the case here, where the motivational rationale posited for Jackson is as persuasive as the notion that Hitler invaded a lot of countries merely because he was in search of a good Geography teacher.An exploitative shambles, then, from start to finish, and a sour one at that, the sequence involving a psycho-killer home-invader as gratuitously nasty as anything to be found in Hollywood's MMM (Murder Movies for Morons) genre and a clear indicator of everything that's wrong with Unbreakable: no warmth, no joy, no humanity, no surprises.Memo to Mr Shyamalan: Willis, Wright and Jackson all deserve much more.

It's amazingly made and unique, because of the realistic depiction of the superhero movies, unlike today that we get the most bizarre superheroes that we see now (note that this isn't a bad thing) and Shyamalan wanted to do something very different at that time - to show us what if superheroes really exist today and he did it superbly.There are many aspects like the music, cinematography, editing, acting, sound, characters, dialogue, direction and the execution of the story - all of those things combined work so well together and make many moments in the story truly emotional.But of course there are still problems that i did found and one of them is the ending. I wouldn't spoil it, but there is a reveal that is still great and executed perfectly, but at the same time, when you think about it - it's very questionable.If you haven't seen it, then i recommend it to everyone, but be warned - since it's not all that long, it will be a bit slow for some, but for many - it's will be very interesting to watch and be invested to everything, that is happening in the movie.",Unbreakable

But with ""The Grinch"" had sold out before we could get there, and this was the only movie that was interesting enough to see.  I was in for a surprise, because I did not expect what I was going to see, and the result was amazing!  Warning: You will be very tempted to talk about this movie for days after, so you must ask people you talk to if they want the movie spoiled for them!!!  Also, do not go to any message boards talking about this movie...chances are, there will be some people who will ruin the fun for all of us and blatantly give the ending/role of the characters away. 
M. Night Shyamalan, which is known for his first feature film ""The Sixth Sense"", comes out with another suspense/thriller movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat and not one part of the movie is boring!  Mr. Shyamalan has displayed some of the most beautiful, yet disturbing type of directorial style that I have ever seen, excluding ""The Sixth Sense""...let's face it, he is a genius.  Anyways, everybody knows that Bruce Willis is the only survivor of a ""sole survivor"" train wreck, and he is not injured, but that's only a small part of the movie.  But before that, even, it leads you into the movie with a few sentences that appear on the screen talking about comic books.  This is a vital part of the movie, but I will not spoil anything about it.  Samuel L. Jackson also gives a splendid display of acting as a man who is pretty frail and has been hospital-ridden for about a third of his life because of a very rare disorder.  These 2 people eventually meet, but with some unexpected twists and turns.  Since you must see this movie to get something out of me, I will tell you that there is an ending with an unexpected twist, but the ending is lacking a lot more than I expected from Mr. Shyamalan.  It's like a story that ends right on the tip of the climax.  I really suggest, if there is an alternate ending or alternate scenes, please put it on the DVD when it comes out!  This part of the movie, though, in the perspective of the whole picture, fits in rather well and does not affect a high score this movie will get on the IMDb.

284,seige-hound,A subversive superhero film made FAR before its time.,9,22 January 2017,"When I first watched this film as a child, I thought it was a boring, slow romp with little resolution. It was short, with hardly any action, and the action it did have had basically zero choreography and style to it.This was a superhero movie made in 2000, the same year the first X- Men movie came out, two years before the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man film, and a massive eight years before the Dark Knight. When Unbreakable was first released, superheroes were still seen as a childish affair, as the world was recovering from Batman and Robin and other badly made, low budget childish comic movies. Unbreakable was a massive shift from the norm, a piece that could be set in the real world.Rewatching it now, this film is an incredible piece that would have been far better received and successful if it were released closer to the present. An emotional film about a man slowly discovering he isn't as normal as he lets on, and an obsessed comic-book nerd who leads him to that truth.The pacing is still incredibly slow for a superhero flick, which may be jarring for some people who come into it expecting such a film. However, if they come in with zero expectation, or expecting a traditional thriller-type movie, they might be pleasantly surprised.If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend it. It was made before director M. Night Shyamalan's fall from critical grace, so you can expect a tight, well written and relatively subtle film with great performances.",Unbreakable
285,crowrobot,Shymalan impresses again....,10,10 August 2005,"Over the past few years, a new name has entered the forefont of science fiction: M. Night Shymalan. His powerhouse ghost drama The Sixth Sense, with it's now-legendary twist ending, was an impressive thriller that made me nervous right from the opening credits. Now we have Unbreakable, a slow and deliberately paced mystery that manages to be one of the best ""superhero"" films I've ever seen.The thing with this movie is that it understands comic books. It understands the fans and their obsessions, and it understands the mythology behind superheroes. Bruce Willis is once again the everyman, and he shows he is not just an action actor. There's real drama here, and Willis plays it really well. Even more impressive is Samuel L. Jackson, who, over the years, has gained a reputation as the ""big and bad black dude"". Here, he's restrained. He's quiet, he doesn't raise his voice, and he doesn't curse much. It's a remarkable performance from this normally fiery actor. Robin Wright Penn combines the right mix of love and exasperation as Bruce Willis's wife, and Spencer Treat Clark, as their son, is another kid actor that Hollywood needs to look out for.Many people don't like the ending to this movie, but you know what? I thought it was appropriate, and it actually shocked me. Shymalan is like Stephen King; he finds unease in everyday objects. Unbreakable is an impressive feat.",Unbreakable

Willis, the same slow pace, a similar mystical scenario which defies logic and a sort of unexpected twist at the end... I actually enjoyed 6th Sense.

287,cwrdlylyn,UNBREAKABLE : Shyamalan Mixes Real Talent W. Overindulgence...,6,16 June 2006,"UNBREAKABLE After his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, M. Night Shyamalan's name became a brand of sorts. In a day when director's rarely get the top billing for their films, M. Night Shyamalan has managed to build up a following strong enough to have all his films labeled ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film"". In today's day, when cinema in general has seemed kind of stagnant, it is refreshing to see a director with such a clear strong vision getting recognition. Though his films since THE SIXTH SENSE have yet to receive the unanimous praise bestowed on that thriller, they have all had the signature stamp of Shyamalan's eye.Ironically, Shyamalan's film that seemed to make the slightest dent on the public radar was his first follow-up to THE SIXTH SENSE... UNBREAKABLE. It takes his typical formula of a slowly revealed secret that is given a huge shift in the final moments of the film, and frames it as an ode to comic books. It tells the story of David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), a man who miraculously survived a disastrous train accident unharmed while all the other passengers died.There appears to be no explanation for David's survival, and the experience cuts a huge rift in David's life. Already estranged from his wife (played by Robin Wright Penn), David seems to become even more removed from his family as he struggles to come to terms with the situation. It seems no one can provide him answers, except a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson). Elijah is a man obsessed with the legacy of comic books as pieces of art, and he also suffers from a protein deficiency that causes his bones to break like glass. Elijah believes that David is a modern day ""superhero"".In his attempts to relay this belief to David, Elijah comes across as a man who has lost his mind. Yet he persistently approaches David with justification for his theory. Turns out David is not only ""unbreakable""... he also has super-strength, a desire to protect people, and impeccable instincts. Elijah continually challenges David to develop these talents and challenge himself... but David is torn between his assumption that Elijah is crazy, the promise he made his wife, and the destiny he might hold.UNBREAKABLE came out one-year after the phenomenon of THE SIXTH SENSE and although it did respectable business at the box office... it never truly caught on with the public. I can only assume it is because of how impersonal the film feels. All the characters are so incredibly introverted that the film feels lifeless at times. It is very slow moving in it's pursuit of the truth... and when David learns new things about his capabilities it is not filmed in a grand way. Everything is kept very subtle, and while that suits the realistic tone of the entire film, it hurts the films pacing.I think in this follow-up, Shyamalan showed many of the skills that made THE SIXTH SENSE so successful. There are some shots in particular that are rather captivating. For example, the opening sequence on the train is filmed in a very interesting manner that works very well as an introduction to David's character and his struggles. In addition, there is a sequence in which David's son holds him at gunpoint that is done very well. Finally, in the last moments when David finally learns to use his powers, there is a particularly chilling shot of a flowing window curtain. However, Shyamalan also becomes over-indulgent at times.There are numerous plot elements here that are granted an unreasonable amount of time whether through story development or extended sequences. For example, in the moments following David's survival of the train crash, Shyamalan takes a ridiculous amount of time. Everything moves in slow motion and in silence for a good 5 minutes and unfortunately it doesn't work. Within the first minute I understood the tension that Shyamalan was trying to capture, but by the 5th minute I was checking my watch. Also, the relationship between Bruce Willis and Robin Wright Penn is poorly done. There is a huge emotional divide between them, and a vast majority of the film focuses on them trying to work things out. However, under the surface of their performances, there is virtually no sense of an undying love.Overall, the film develops in an intriguing manner, but too much of it feels useless. I think quite a bit of footage was included because Shyamalan was looking to strengthen the mood and artistic merit of the film... but in the end the movie needed a little more of a mainstream pacing. By having the film move so incredibly slow at times, Shyamalan loses his audience at times. If the film could have been paced a bit more briskly perhaps it would have reached its full potential. However, for true fans of Shyamalan, this does make for an interesting viewing experience. Many of his talents are evident, though while riding on the success of THE SIXTH SENSE it appears Shyamalan got a little too indulgent at times.... C+ ...",Unbreakable

290,RestlessRust,This movie is haunted by the ghost of Shyamalan's past.,6,10 January 2001,"There is something inherently difficult in making a movie after striking gold in ""The Sixth Sense,"" and ""Unbreakable"" is haunted by the legacy of it's predecessor.   Part of the problem is that this movie just isn't as good as Shyamalan's first film.  (And lest you think the comparison is unfair, be aware that similarities to ""The Sixth Sense"" abound in ""Unbreakable""--it's even set in the same city!)  Another problem is that Shyamalan's knack for dramatic realism is undermined by the fact that this is basically a Superman movie.   But the real problem is that, after including a whopper of an ending in ""Sixth Sense,"" we, the viewers can't help but try to figure out what the surprise ending will be.  (We know there will be one, because  everyone expects it and will be disappointed if there isn't one.)  That instinct is very distracting, making it hard to feel for the characters because we're trying to decide what lies beneath the plot.   And the absolute worst part of the film is that the payoff for all our conjecture is simply not worth it.  Yes, it is surprising, but it is not a chilling, jaw-dropping revelation that completely changes the movie.  At best, you may find yourself saying, ""Wow, I didn't that coming!""  At the end of ""The Sixth Sense,"" I saw many movie-goers who were absolutely speechless. The ones that could talk were trying to figure out how they'd missed it. ""Unbreakable"" elicited none of these reactions when I saw it.  My suggestion for Shyamalan is to make a completely different movie (different style, feel, maybe even genre) next time to suppress the inevitable comparisons and try to regain the creative freedom he exercised so well in his first film.",Unbreakable
291,el_monty_BCN,I'm sorry but M. Night Shyamalan has no sense of rhythm,7,13 January 2001,"PLOT SPOILERS AHEADOK, so I didn't figure out the twist this time, even though it was basically the same mechanism as in the Sixth Sense (there's a gifted person and a mentor, what if the gifted guy's gift is applied on the mentor as well). And thank God for that, because if I had, again the experience would have been quite pointless. I admit this time I enjoyed it a bit more, one or two scenes stood out (the kid with the gun, Jackson facing the stairs) but still: The problem with Shyamalan's two films is that they are ideas, high concepts, which I think would be great for a short or a medium length feature, but they're just too thin for the two hour movie format. They rely too heavily on the final revelation to make sense, and while you wait for it to come, they lack any semblance of pace and go awwwwfully slowly. If at least Shyamalan was able to come up with other engaging plots to ease the wait, but his attempts (the stories of each ghost in SS, the shaky marriage and the psycho squatter in this one) are just too weak and go nowhere, on top of that Shyamalan seems to need to make time by coming back to things again and again (OK, I'll try my gift on the cameoing director and.. oops no, it didn't work. But after remembering something I already knew anyway, I'll try again and hey, what do you know, in two minutes I found a weirdo psychopath). I was downright bored at times and the only thing that kept me in my seat was the knowledge that Shyamalan would come up with something good for the end. But you know that's not the way it should be.I hope Shyamalan drops the formula for his next film and does something more solid, or else I'm going to stop buying the hype and wait for the videos.",Unbreakable

293,Denver53,"More cerebral, yet somehow lacking",7,1 August 2001,"I was never especially impressed with The Sixth Sense. The big ""surprise"" was apparent to me after one or two scenes where I noticed that no one except the child paid any attention to Bruce Willis' character, even when he apparently touched them.So I viewed Unbreakable with some mild cynicism. A surprise ending, I heard. Oh boy.I was pleasantly surprised myself to realize as the movie unfolded that this was a thinking person's movie. There is a little action, sure. But the real issues have to do with why the two main characters are who they are. I don't just mean they are the ""good guy"" and ""bad guy,"" either. Why are they unique, yet only one seems aware of it? Why is the ""evil"" one so interested in finding the ""good"" one and showing him his abilities? And what exactly ARE the unique abilities each side has? And is there some cosmic purpose involved?My wife was frustrated with the movie's slow pace. I wasn't, because it gave me time to sort out what the movie was telling the viewer about the characters and their motivations. The acting is very good. Bruce Willis is much more than a one-note actor, and Samual Jackson is simply a good actor, period.My one disappointment was, of course, the ending. SPOILERS AHEAD! While I found it hard to believe that a guy would never notice his amazing ability to be invulnerable and stronger than others, or, if he did notice, to essentially hide it from everyone, I was even more skeptical of a bad guy who, I guess, apparently causes random accidents that kill hundreds of people in an attempt to find the hero. OK, do you know how long this could take, and how many people would die? What if the hero was in Nepal? And yet this super smart, clever bad guy just starts his trail of accidents in the US? Is he just nuts? Surely someone would eventually catch him. Besides, if the movie really wanted to make the ending a shocker, it would have tied the evil guy to accidents that have happened in the REAL world, not in the movie. That would have got you thinking.Still, when all is said and done, I enjoyed the concepts in Unbreakable. I hope if there is a sequel, we see some logical growth here and not simply ""surprises"" for the sake of surprise. I gave it a 7.",Unbreakable

The film is about people and the words they speak, not special effects (thank God!)I found some of the panning and scanning and tilting and circling of the camera to be somewhat distracting; but overall, ""Unbreakable"" is a mesmerizing tale of an everyman, who comes to grips with his place in the world.

When you look at these dated films, you can see the same heavy progress in most of them. The end of the movie was not bad, I think it was better than the other parts.If you like Night Shamalan movies, you will also watch this movie. Otherwise, it may sound slow. It may be the only movie that Samuel L. Jackson never cursed. And he played very well. Bruce Willis repeats his performance in the 6th His movie.I decided to watch it because it was in the same universe after Split and they would be together at Mr.Glass.
Acting is good enough. Samuel L. Jackson literally reflected the character's feelings. The fact that the subject is strange and the script is narrow (the story takes place in a certain period of time, but David's life was important in this scenario.

Instead, it takes the screenplay formula established by 'The Sixth Sense' (deadpan acting by Willis, a series of odd events, dark atmospheres, etc.) and injects a new premise that is even less believable than the ""I see dead people"" theme of its predecessor.  The film has a few interesting moments, but is largely derivative, contrived and painfully slow-moving.The unexpected ending intends to shock, but is so far out there that the audience reaction was more of a ""huh?!?"" than anything resembling surprise.

299,flickjunkie-3,"Quite A Disappointment, But Not Completely Awful.",6,15 December 2000,"M. Night Shyamalan's first film, The Sixth Sense, was one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen in my life. But, however, his second feature, Unbreakable, does definitely not meet these standards.Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) miraculously survives a catastrophic train crash outside Philadelphia. Not only is he the sole survivor out of 132 passengers, he also is completely unharmed. A little later, comic book specialist Elijah Price contacts him to confront David with an incredible theory: Elijah, who has been nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"" due to his more than fragile bones, thinks that David has got all which he himself lacks. The two of them ""seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends"". First, David does not believe the strange man, but every single thing he had said proves to be true: David has never ever been hurt or sick in his life, his physical strength is larger than normal and he has a skill which others don't. Slowly, David begins to discover the shocking truth behind Mr. Price's assumptions. But after all, David's fate is not only to find his real place in the world. It also is about proving Elijah's theory of his own existence. There are lots of good things about Unbreakable. But, unfortunately there are many bad things. The writing is somewhat rushed, while the characters are hardly developed before the action part of the film begins, and sometimes Unbreakable is just too slow and too boring for its own good. But, some of these bad things are saved by some good performances (including a blaster from Spencer Treat Clark), M. Night Shyamalan's magical directing touch and rare thrilling action sequences.Not memorable, or brilliant, but it should keep you interested for a couple of hours.I rate Unbreakable 6 out of 10.",Unbreakable
300,Laitue_Gonflable,Disappointing,5,22 August 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSUnbreakable was the first taste I got of M Night Shyamalan and, before viewing it, I had no idea of what it was going to be like or about. When the film had finished, all I could do was think of how much better it could have been.It essentially tells the story of a man who is seemingly invulnerable, or if you will, unbreakable, who is befriended by the approximate opposite, an unnervingly fragile and injury-prone man. The premise sounds almost like an Adam Sandler comedy but it's told with Shyamalan's patented intrigue and suspense. And yet the story doesn't have nearly as much potential for these elements as his later work, and what in The Sixth Sense is brilliantly creepy and frightening comes off here as just slow, and over-dramatic.The fact of the matter is that when I thought this was going to be some mad, explosive action thriller, it could well have been the case. I think this would have worked a lot better if it had been directed by McTiernan rather than Shyamalan. The latter directs it sluggishly and tries to pull far too much intrigue from what is, at heart, a very shallow story. Put a few car chases and semi-naked women in this film and you get, okay, very cheesy entertainment, but entertainment nonetheless.Bruce Willis, also, is another big problem. Once again he fails to grasp the concept of conviction in acting and his sub-average performance in this film is undoubtable testament to his lack of talent. Quite frankly, his light dialogue, heavy action films give him far more credit than when he is required to produce any emotional response or a line requiring dramatic timing. Samuel L Jackson is a little better but not a great deal, while more can be said of Robin Wright Penn who plays Willis's wife.Overall, an overplayed suspense drama but with a great ending that unfortunately takes a fair while to happen. ***/*****",Unbreakable
301,Siloty,different but entertaining,9,9 June 2008,"i saw bits of this years ago on TV and thought it was good. about 2-3 nights ago it was on again so i decided to sit down and watch the whole movie, and i'm very glad that i did.the movie is filmed as though it is a comic book come to life. dialogue and actions that would normally be put into each individual picture of the book. camera angles and the slightly blue coloured filter used throughout most of the movie add to this effect.the idea that the comic book characters of today are based off actual human abilities are somewhat exaggerated was good. that there are real heroes out there in the world, extending an arm to those in need. that some people out there have more to them then they know, but they have got to believe and develop their skills for hope to go further with their purpose.Samuel L. Jackson's character (Elijah...who suffers from osteogenesis imperfecta) has a somewhat strange obsession with comic books and their characters. believing that there is someone out there who is a ""superhero"". what he does to find this person is a scary thought but in the end finds him with Bruce Willis' character David Dunn.David finds it hard to believe this but his son, the true innocence of a child, fully believes in what Elijah is saying and becomes very upset that his father does not believe in himself. does not believe that he cannot be hurt.But every hero has a weakness and every hero has a villain as an opposite. this movie delivers these themes and this story very well.",Unbreakable
302,paul-nemecek,Unbreakable in Unbearable,5,8 July 2018,"I looked forward to M. Night Shymalan's Unbreakable with great anticipation. Shymalan's previous film as writer-director was last year's innovative thriller The Sixth Sense. I was, alas, pretty disappointed in this film. In the end, this film was not unbearably suspenseful, it was simply unbearable.The film reunites Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson (Die Hard with a Vengeance and Pulp Fiction), two great actors wasted in a maudlin mess of mediocrity. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book collector suffering from a rare disease that leaves his bones brittle and easily broken. Bruce Willis plays a security guard who is the sole survivor of a disastrous train wreck. Not only has he survived, but he survived without a scratch. Could it be that he is unbreakable?To be fair, there are inspired moments of writing here, but the whole is decidedly smaller than the parts. The film's tone is uneven--so much so that the audience laughed hysterically at one of the more dramatic scenes--and the acting is pretty flat. In fact, Shymalan's line from The Sixth Sense, ""I see dead people"" might be more relevant here. The central character follows a fairly traditional hero's quest, but the character has such a flat personality that I was left feeling pretty uninspired. The comic-book ending made the film seem even more disjointed. Throwing together a bunch of talented people does not necessarily result in a talented film.If you are in the mood for heroes and unbreakable characters, I would recommend two other films currently playing rather than this lackluster loser. Remember the Titans is inspiring, relevant, and wonderfully told. Men of Honor is a wonderful story of courage and character. Both films deal with racism and heroic responses. These are both four-star films in my book. If you really want to see Unbreakable, wait for the video. This is a film that will not lose much in the transfer to the small screen, and if your expectations and the price of admission are a bit lower, you might even enjoy it.",Unbreakable
303,severindringel,Finally a superhero movie of a different kind,8,9 August 2021,"After The Sixth Sense fully picked me up despite its numerous spoiled twist, I immediately caught up with M. Night Shyamalan's next hit. Controversial among the broad audience, the director holds on to many elements of the previous psychological thriller in Unbreakable: Bruce Willis plays the lead role, a mystery around the exorbitant abilities of the protagonist accompanies us for the entire 1 ¾ hours and there is a surprising twist at the end.If Bruce Willis was already completely convincing as a child therapist in The Sixth Sense, he goes one better in this film in a completely different role. As the family man David Dunn, he rejects any sympathy in his very first scene and you actually think you've already found your antagonist. However, it turns out quite differently, because Dunn goes on a journey of self-discovery after several bizarre incidents around his person, which suddenly make the character with all his demons much more comprehensible. Especially in the moments with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), Willis brings a certain sensitivity that creates a nice father-son chemistry. Robin Wright is also able to trigger much in the protagonist in her few scenes as Dunn's wife. In the wake of their marital problems, the dialogue at first seems distant and at times frustrating, but as soon as Dunn lets her in on his personal crisis, there is a family feel again between the two. It's a shame that in my time as a movie geek, Willis has so far only been considered a limited actor. Because in times of Die Hard and the two collaborations with Shyamalan, you can clearly see the talent that this man held, not only in the action genre. He manages to usurp the entire plot. This is respectable insofar as Samuel L. Jackson, a top-class actor, is at his side. He embodies Elijah Price, a physically impaired art collector and big comic book fan who suffers from a genetic disease after an incident at birth, namely his bones are as fragile as glass. He brings Dunn's mysterious powers to his attention, and though Price only has a handful of scenes, Jackson's performance is enormously effective. His presence has a major impact on Dunn's personal life and a fascinating relationship forms between the two. For the characters are actually complete opposites, but in reality are closer than one might think.Shyamalan's second work also caught me thanks to its quirkiness. Unbreakable is quite similar to The Sixth Sense in its basic nature, but then is able to separate itself noticeably from it with the differences in genre. This film is not just a linear thriller that wants to be remembered only for its twist at the end, but one of the first intelligent superhero films. Before Marvel and Co. Manifested a yet clearly apparent structure in this genre, Shyamalan, as a devoted comic book fan, came up with something special here: A story about a man who is unaware of his powers and must first figure them out. This journey is told slowly, but sticks. And that compensates for the somewhat lacking twist at the end.",Unbreakable

I saw it in a theater and the end really caught me, and everybody else, offguard. Next Shyamalan did Unbreakable and then my favorite of these three movies, Signs. Unbreakable is an above-average thriller/drama, but still I find it somewhat weaker than the Sixth Sense or Signs. And in this case ""weaker"" isn´t a huge drawback as Unbreakable would still beat 90% of all the so-called psychological thrillers coming out of Hollywood every other second. Only few films manage to create heavy atmospheres and suspenseful moments and even fewer films have talented actors. Bruce Willis might not the greatest actor in Hollywood, but he knows how to do his job well. Samuel L. Jackson is also a very reliable actor and I´m sure that the fact that these two men were both in the third Die Hard movie helped to create the chemistry necessary for movies like this.

Night Shyamalan's films and I've discovered he rates high on my least liked director and writer lists. Why it's taken me this long to realize this can only be attributed to my own inattention, or perhaps to the fact that nothing he's ever done has interested me enough to pay attention to who did it.There are people whose films I like. There are people whose films I admire. There are those whose I like, but don't admire, and vise-versa. A handful I both like and admire. To balance this, there are people like M. Night Shyamalan whose films I neither like nor admire.Shyamalan is an auteur who seems to think he's being profound and clever when all he's being is ponderous and tedious. His films always have a ""surprise"" ending which, when it arrives, is either not much of a surprise (e.g. ""The Village"") or I'm long past caring (e.g. ""Unbreakable"").Pity - this film has the germ of an interesting idea in more capable hands. However watching it, I find myself actively fighting alternating fits of boredom and impatience. I find myself wanting to yell at the screen, ""If you have a point to make, make it!""

It's directed brilliantly, he truly is a film maker of the highest calibre, but beneath the technical brilliance of it, lies a story which doesn't really pay off.

316,angelynx-2,Absorbing and fascinating,10,25 November 2000,"An early holiday gift from a top-notch storyteller. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" is a fascinating, totally absorbing film that does for the tale of superhero vs. super-villain what ""The Sixth Sense"" did for the ghost story. It refreshes a done-to-death film theme and draws it completely into our own real world with thoughtful, sympathetic writing and performances of wonderful subtlety, humanity and depth. It is so exquisitely spare and minimal - especially in its dialog - and so careful to pick up every thread it lays down, that it puts 98% of the crowded, messy, noisy flicks out there to shame. Anyone who's turned off by the idea that this might be a ""comic-book movie"", PLEASE put that thought aside - this is not about explosions, special effects or black/white solutions, but about the very nature of heroism and villainy (and I do *not* mean ""good and evil""), and the searching of soul that extraordinary beings must do before deciding what their work in the world should be. And the results of their search can be both inspiring and chilling, as we see here. Willis and Jackson are absolutely perfect, Willis' painful and troubled everyman honesty exactly contrasting Jackson's steely conviction and laser intensity (every fan will cheer the scene in which he icily rebuffs a sorely misguided gallery customer!). But no one here is a toss-away character, even the adversary's mom has importance. And the expected twist ending is a beauty; some apparently saw it coming sooner than I did=), but I was completely blindsided and loved it. --Again: if the idea of a movie with a comic book theme bothers you, please take my word on this and don't let it keep you from seeing ""Unbreakable"". You'd be missing something far too worthwhile.",Unbreakable
317,mercury-26,shyamalan got me again,9,1 December 2000,"That this is the second straight collaboration between writer/director Shyamalan and Bruce Willis isn't as interesting to me as this: `Unbreakable' is the third film starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The three films and six roles played couldn't be more different.The first is of course, `Pulp Fiction,' a film that launched Jackson to superstardom and re-ignited Willis' career. They play two of the film's main characters, a boxer in a rigged fight and a hit-man who finds spirituality. They have one scene together but even then they never say a word to each other. The two characters have a strange connection though. It's one of those between-the-lines kinds of things that you only notice if you've seen a film as many times as I've seen `PF.' Both performances are arguably their best.Next is `Die Hard With a Vengeance,' which cast Willis as New York cop John McClain again, with Jackson as his reluctant sidekick, Zues. I like the movie but I can never figure out quite why Jackson's character is there other than to give McClain someone to talk to. Nevertheless, the two are in most of their scenes together. For some reason the franchise turns its back on the whole one-man-against-an-army concept of the first two films and turns the third into a buddy movie.Five years later, both men's careers are still sizzling. `Unbreakable' will do nothing to hurt either. I never once thought of Jules Winfield or Butch Coolidge, John McClain or Zeus Carver. Again, the two play completely different characters from any they've played before. Willis plays David Dunn, a guy who can't remember the last time he was sick, broke a bone, or even got a paper cut. He's just survived a train wreck that no one else survived. Not only that, he walked away without a scratch. Jackson plays Elijah Price, a man who would seem to be David's exact opposite. Elijah has a degenerative bone disease that makes them very brittle and easy to break. Elijah has a few hobbies. One is collecting rare comic book art and studying it. Another is finding his exact opposite. He believes that if someone like him can exist, someone who breaks very easily, then why shouldn't someone exist who can't be broken?Let's get one thing out of the way before I go on: Shyamalan is a genius. To have conceived, written and pulled a project the caliber of `Unbreakable' together in the short time between completing `Sixth Sense' and now is incredible. No sophomore slump here. `Unbreakable' will stick to your bones like turkey and mashed potatoes.Unlike `Sixth Sense,' the director takes a few minor missteps here. These are technical faults that can be attributed to having to work on more of a deadline than the last time. Just because his last film was perfect doesn't mean he's infallible. It isn't perfect, but `Unbreakable' is definitely a success.Anyone who saw `Sixth Sense' will recognize Shyamalan's filmmaking style here. The pacing is the same. He again unfolds the story slowly. `Unbreakable' doesn't build to quite the crescendo that `SS' does, but you can see an unmistakably similar formula at work. Each auteur has his/her own.Shyamalan's gift seems to be laying out the clues for those perceptive enough to see them. If you just sit back and enjoy, you'll be surprised at the end. Your jaw will hit the floor with almost as much velocity as it did in `SS.' The more perceptive though, will pick up on the clues and won't be fooled. I was fooled. Again. But that's what makes it so much fun.Grade: A-",Unbreakable

He thinks that Bruce is a superhero, and then... well, from there on in, you have to see the film.Notably, if you thought that Sense was slower than a turtle, this goes at a speed of 10 out of 100. Some parts aren't made for those with impatience, but you have to go through those to get to the good parts.And finally, the twist in the end. I have seen this once (when I get the video, I'll see it again), so I wouldn't know if the twist is just a fast one or really makes sense. (No pun intended.)

320,larcher-2,Less and more,8,24 November 2000,"Less and more than The Sixth Sense.  In some ways, this film is just a reworking of Sixth Sense, with Willis in the Osment slot.  The style, the structure, and many of the themes are the same.  Both depend a great deal on mood, and both leave a few plot threads unresolved.  Unbreakable is less because we've seen Sixth Sense, and so can anticipate the plot pretty well (including the shock ending).  It's a bit more because it is darker and more thought-provoking.  The movie drops a terrible moral conundrum in our laps--and gives us almost no clue toward its resolution.  The rather sunny resolution of Sixth Sense is replaced with something very bitter.  The movie would have been better if this bitterness were not so dependent on a brief twist at the end, but were more integrated into the characters' development. Nonetheless, it's a solid bit of work that seems better and better upon reflection.",Unbreakable
321,GLanoue,Even comic book heroes get the blues,9,4 January 2012,"This underrated film is a pleasant antidote to Hollywood's emphasis on special effects. Bruce Willis is a reluctant superhero who takes years to come to grips with his powers – a form of psychic sensitivity, unnatural strength, and, of course, the fact that he is almost indestructible. Samuel L. Jackson is his antithesis – cerebral (Willis, as I said, has trouble figuring things out), physically fragile to the point of being known as Mr Glass, and for most of the film, relatively immobile and confined to a wheelchair. This film's strong points are its dark, muted colours, its lazy rhythm (long shot lengths) combined with constant slow panning, and its cast. Willis is terrific as a man psychically tortured by his strengths (he has trouble connecting with his wife, his job, and his life in general) who is trying to flee the growing realisation that he doesn't belong, while Jackson is excellent as a man emotionally twisted by his physical impotence. The dialogue is terse, minimalist, and contextualised in an intelligent way, since the thesis-antithesis plot is voiced mostly by Jackson in his character as an art dealer specialising in comic books. Appropriately, the visual imagery analysed and presented by Jackson (which is largely correct, BTW, especially the emphasis on large heads and skewed eyes on villains) acts as a counterpoint and bait to Willis, a kind of blind Argos. Willis' son communicates well the appropriate stunned look of alienation, so we understand his emotional investment in helping his father understand his destiny. The denouement is interesting: Jackson sees all, at least in terms of the comic book logic that has been his one crutch throughout his life, yet we discover that he is just as emotionally crippled as he is physically weak, while Willis slowly comes to see his role not as someone made special by his powers, but as someone whose destiny is to be conventionally honest, moral and kind. What is the message? That real heroism is facing the everyday ""evil"" of banality (Willis is a security guard who lives in a somewhat grotty home)? Perhaps. I don't think that other actors could have worked so well together to convey this slowly growing tension between blindness and sight, strength and weakness. Okay, Shyamalan has been parodied especially on Robot Chicken for sticking to his formulaic ""twists"" that seem too pat, too deus ex machina, but here it works because the underlying narrative structure of the filmic action is the simple black or white logic of comic book morality. Even for the tortured superheroes that have followed on the heels of Spiderman, a sudden twist at the end is appropriate for the war of good and evil. I don't think he chose the comic book backstory for Jackson's character by accident. Yet, despite the apparent simplicity of the moral imperatives that are its backbone, the film manages to provoke.",Unbreakable
322,quin1974,Shyamalan is a name to keep track of in the future,9,23 January 2001,"WARNING! SPOILERS!When I entered the theater I had very low expectations, since I did not really like The Sixth Sense. But I was very surprised at the originality and sincerity with which this story was depicted on the screen.For the first time in movie history I saw a movie that looked at comics in a very mature way. Not just men in tights wearing their underwear over their pants, but intelligent human portrayals of what must be a terrifying realization that you are a superhuman being. In this way this story reminded me a lot of a Kurt Busiek comics series ""Astro City"". In this series the people behind the superheroes are depicted as very human with human troubles, as was the case in this movie.Of course the acting performances were outstanding, if sometimes a little too quiet. Willis once again transcended his earlier serious roles (Twelve Monkeys, Sixth Sense) and has to be rewarded in some way for his better work in the future, he is truly a sight for sore eyes on the screen. Sam Jackson is always great to watch, his role of the villain was magnificent. I dare to say that from a child-directing perspective M. Night Shyamalan has to be the next Spielberg. Once again he dares to take on the task to direct a kid in a difficult role (as he did Haley Joel Osment in Sixth Sense) with Spencer Treat Clark (Gladiator), and he succeeds admirably. The role of Robin Wright Penn could have been developed more, but that didn't really obstruct the main storyline.An honorable mention goes out to cinematographer Eduardo Serra for his use of color. It was striking to watch the scenes where Willis is touched by normal people, and subsequently seeing these same people in more vibrant color during their crimes in the future or past, marvelous. I had a hunch that in the end Jackson would be some kind of bad guy, because in his clothing and surroundings there was always a little purple present, this connected with the bad/color theme this makes the ending a lot more convincing. But you have to have an eye for this or even see the movie twice. The camera movements on the other hand were sometimes a little too shaky, i.e. the opening scene and the scene in the train were just too fabricated when it comes to camera movement, a little over the top.The story line was very well paced, although I must say that Shyamalan should consider a little more up-tempo pace for his next movie. It worked in this movie, but I think the audience will not buy another slow-paced movie from the same director after The Sixth Sense and this. Some of the scenes were dragged on a little too long too my taste, as if the director wanted to make up for time, not wanting his movie to come near the magic 90 minutes boundary.Overall a very fine accomplishment. I recommend this movie to everyone who has even a shred of knowledge in a mature way about comics. I must say that together with X-Men I think the future of comics can be said to be in good hands with young directors.9/10",Unbreakable
323,jtfsouth,Not captivating enough!,6,4 July 2001,"According to tom.kat@talk21.com of Northampton, England if anyone doesn't understand this movie we should stick to Disney, and this was better than The Sixth Sense. I am sure you think Howard The Duck should have been put up for an Oscar too. Well buddy, this movie was about as easy to understand as a Disney movie so I can understand how your small brain would think so.There was no ""Twist"" to this movie! There was nothing to twist to! There was nothing that would lead you to believe what the ""stunning outcome"" would have been like in The Sixth Sense. In that movie there were small clues left all over the film to make you realize before the movie was over.I am not going to try and compare the scripts of The Sixth Sense, to this movie because it's like comparing an apple to an orange, two separate movies.
Bruce Willis's acting in the film was less than par as well. I am am fond of his acting but it seems that the whole movie he had no emotion,  and was boring.

326,MyOpinionIsFact,Okay,4,20 January 2005,"Unbreakable suffers from several flaws that kept it from being a good movie but strong performances by Willis and Jackson keep the movie from tanking. The script could have used some smoothing of rough edges, which is obvious (perhaps Shyamalan was a little blinded by his own success or people were reluctant to mention it). In particular a scene involving a gun does not work, a madman in a fight scene does something implausible, and the ending itself is somewhat of a letdown. The premise is also taken too far as the hero discovers his abilities. This causes the movie to leave the realm of subtlety for which it seemed to be aiming. I'll ignore the flaws in Mr. Glass's reasoning as part of my suspension of disbelief. Despite all this, the movie is engaging and keeps the viewer uncertain as to what's to come. Jackson delivers a compiling character that lifts the film every time he's on screen. In short, Unbreakable could have been a good movie but it ended up just okay.",Unbreakable
327,Matt73,Way Below Expectation,6,5 February 2001,"After seeing ""The Sixth Sense"", I thought this new piece by M. Night Shyamalan would achieve the same standard or even surpass it.

The conversation scene between Bruce Willis and Robin Wright Penn was pointless. The weight-lifting scene was too long. The rescue scene was unbelievable. But the worst thing in this movie was the music! What kind of score was that?

Bruce Willis is the supposedly tortured soul who is ""unbreakable"".  Why no one noticed this in over 30 years is given short shrift by the writer-director.

When it was over my boyfriend and I just sat in the dark silently for a while and then were up til 2 am and cuddling and talking about the movie, life etc.  This is what movies should do. Evoke a strong emotional response in their audience and be highly entertaining. As for people who didn't ""get it"". Try viewing the movie next time without blinders. Here is a brief synopsis of what the movie is about. It's about an ordinary man who finds out he isn't very ordinary after all. His feelings of melancholy about his life soon transferred to all aspects and he eventually was a shadow of his former self and contributed nothing as a father or as a husband. He finds out he is in fact extraordinary and that he has a higher purpose in life which is to use his gifts to help mankind. The brilliant twist with Jackson at the end was like poetry in motion. The subtle hints about Jackson are beautiful..the dazzling material we see peaking out of his overcoat now and again. I don't think I made the connection until the gallery when his mother explains to Willis about the two kinds of heroes.  Then I felt stupid for not putting it together sooner. How lovely that he took such care with character development and pacing. I am sorry waited for video on this.10 out of 10",Unbreakable
330,Mr_Mirage,"By, and for, fans of comix",10,26 January 2002,"A first edition of a comic book, especially at this point in history, is often slow and ponderous. Character and situations are developed, and plots begin. This is called an origin story, and fans of comix understand that often the story needs a while to develop.Sadly, film fans aren't attentive to such things. They have become jaded thrill seekers who cannot sit through a film that actually has something to say, and says it in its own sweet time.This film has a lot going on in it, just in terms of the scripting, and especially in the development of the characters. (In fact, this is the only film I own on DVD where I disagreed with every single deleted scene. I felt that the scenes only added MORE to the story.)It is a rare film, for me, that makes me actually desire to see a sequel. Not only do I ache for a return to the story of David Dunn, I felt inspired to actually write out a quick treatment. Fans of Star Wars and the X files do that, I know, and I never understood that, until I watched this film.

And who is this guy who approaches him and tries to explain to the main character what HE thinks happened? Is he a kook or can you accept that he might be right? I enjoyed every twist and turn; every new revelation taking you to a new level of thought. Very well written. I enjoyed Bruce Willis in the main role and Samuel L.Jackson was fabulous.

332,AdFin,"""Do you know what the scariest thing is? To Not know you're place in this world"" - A comment on THAT ending.",9,26 December 2001,"WARNING Major Spoilers""I think it's time we shuck hands"", and with the simple line, the last hundred minutes of Unbreakable become painfully clear. We now know why Shyamalan began his film with the birth of Elijah Price (Jackson), because it is Elijah who has been more important in the plot of the film than David Dunn (Willis) ever was. This film is not about superheros, it's about emotional pain, the confession of Elijah given at the end is heartbreaking, the things he's talking about are things that affect people everyday, but through his acts it's clear that his pain has driven him to insanity. The ending doesn't make you look at the film any differently, but instead, on subsequent viewings we notice how Elijah acts. On first viewing we are too rapped up in Willis' character, and his shock discovery that he might be a little different than he had thought, but on second or third viewings we see more and more the pain that is driving Elijah to set up these events. Elijah has to be sure of David's powers to make sure he is right ""Now I know who you are, I know who I am"" he states in his confession, he goes on, drawing parallels through the comic books that took away the pain of his childhood, to his own life ""I'm not a mistake, in a comic do you know how you can tell who the arch villain is going to be, he's the exact opposite of the hero"". Elijah goes to great lengths to point out to David how the ""sacrifices"" and the ""tragedies"" where not in vein, because now he has purpose, incapable of understanding just how far his mind has gone, as the revelation goes on, more and more of the pain Elijah has gone though is revealed. ""I should have know way back when, because of the Kids, they called me Mr Glass""... And with that we know that Shyamalan has succeeded with this film (unlike the Sixth Sense) is completely pulling the wool over the audiences eyes. If the film ended right at this point Unbreakable would be a 10/10 for sure, but no. End of SpoilersNow we come to the proper comment on the film, no in-depth analysis here, just an honest comment, for you see Shyamalan was obviously so hungry for the same success of The Sixth Sense (but didn't want to compromise his artistic integrity) that he cops out with the last few seconds. Instead of leaving the film on a cliff-hanger, allowing the audiences to use their imagination, Shyamalan has to end his film with two tacked on title cards that explain the events that will happen after the film has faded to black, this was a foolish and lazy move on the part of the writer/director, and for me spoiled the ambiguity that the film had been building right until the shock revelation left me begging for more. Unbreakable is a great film and deserves to be studied and pondered over, if it had ended twenty seconds earlier, we could have been dealing with one of the most underrated modern classics of the last ten years. 9/10",Unbreakable

334,mrrockey,A Unique and Interesting Take on the Superhero Origin Story,8,11 February 2014,"Superhero movies, what can you say about them? Every year, we see at least one of them and every time they come out, it's money in the bank for the studios. But with how popular the genre has become, one film that's often overlooked in the genre is M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable. Which is sad because this is actually one of the more thought-provoking and unique films in the genre. So why do so few people talk about this movie after all these years? Let's find out.Plot: David Dunn is a security guard who becomes the sole survivor of a train accident with no sustained injuries whatsoever. After surviving the train accident, David receives a mysterious note asking him the question ""How many times have you been sick?"" and from then on, he embarks on a journey with Elijah Price, a comic-book historian and museum owner who suffers from Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a disease that causes the patient's bones to be extremely brittle, to discover that David may be, a superhuman.The thing that surprised me about this film is how it has its own mythology and how believable and unique it is. This film has the idea that comic-books are basically representations of real-life but that they've been commercialized so they lost some of that truth but the essence is still there. People may not be able to see through walls or shoot fire out of their hands in real-life but people DO have extraordinary abilities that seem out of this world such as David's ability to never be injured or his ability to tell bad deeds someone's done simply by touching their hand. There's a lot of films made about the idea of having a superhero in real-life such as Kick-Ass and Super but I've never seen a film before that suggests comic-books to be real. Also, while the idea of a man being ""unbreakable"" and able to tell someone's bad deeds just by touching their hand would seem very silly if it was done in the traditional, Hollywood blockbuster way where we would see David do all sorts of crazy stuff with CGI and stuff, Shayamalan presents this idea in a believable, realistic fashion. David in this movie is certainly not a regular human being, but at the same time, his powers are JUST down-to-earth enough for us to buy that someone could possibly possess these powers in real- life. It's a remarkable achievement for a film to make me believe that a guy could possibly possess superpowers in real-life.There's also lot of philosophy and questions raised in this film. This movie features the idea of destiny in that we're all meant to follow a certain path in life whether we want to or not and it's quite fascinating. This movie features the ""born to be the hero"" archetype in David with him destined to be a superhero but it also features the OTHER side of the spectrum, the man born to be the villain, Elijah Price A.K.A Mr. Glass. The concept about a man being destined to become a hero is obviously not anything new as we've seen it all throughout film and literature but what makes this different is that this movie doesn't quite present it as simply ""Destiny is good, you are meant for great things!"". It challenges us by asking ""What if you are born a villain?"", and this is a great, FASCINATING topic that this movie thankfully delves into quite a lot. It makes you question ""Is evil born, or is it created?"". And while there a bunch of different ways to look at this film, in my eyes, it's both. Mr. Glass in this film is born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which causes him to feel lonely and lost as he struggles to find his place in the world but when he finds out he's meant to be the yang to David's yin, he finally knows who he is and why he's born the way he was. While it's not exactly a comforting thing to know, he at least finally knows his place in the world. But on the other hand, it's CREATED because it was Elijah's desperation that led to him to his quest where he initiated acts of terrorism just to find his opposite, David.Now, let's talk about the acting and the directing. I'll just talk about Willis and Jackson since this film is really just about them. Bruce Willis is excellent here as David. He plays David as someone who is simply lost as to who he is life and who's feeling this constant sadness with that he can't explain and Willis'soft-spoken, brooding personality fits very well into this character. Samuel plays Elijah as a very determined and philosophical figure. He delivers all of his lines with a presence of authority and Sam's voice really convinces you what he's saying, is true. His best scene is towards the end where he breaks down in tears from finding out who he is and this is a very tricky scene for any actor to act out because his character is feeling a lot of different emotions at the same time. But Sam really sells this scene and makes it a really powerful moment in the film.Shyamalan surprisingly did a very good job directing this film. He gives this film a slow, unsettling mood and it makes the film all the more engaging and interesting as it makes it feel very unpredictable. He used a lot of takes that go on for a really long time and that really helps you get into what the actors are saying for some reason. But one minor thing that bugged me about his direction was his constant use of upside- down shots. I don't know, I just found them sort of distracting.Overall, the unique mythology, fascinating philosophy, solid acting, and engaging direction all add up to one of the most captivating superhero films ever made. 10/10",Unbreakable

338,abum190,So close to being great,8,18 November 2006,"It's really frustrating to find a movie that comes so close to being great and only a few minor faults are holding it back. Luckily, it's not so frustrating that it ruins the experience. Unbreakable is still an intense and emotional movie and I wish M. Night Shyamalan was still making movies like this.Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man unhappy with his marriage and his relationship with his son. David is trying to get a job in New York so he can move out of the house and move his life in his own direction. When his train back from New York derails, David is the only survivor and he is sought out by a fragile man named Elijah, who believes David is special.This could easily be cheesy, but Shyamalan wisely plays up the comic-book feeling of the plot while maintaining a certain sense of reality. Bruce Willis is a good choice as the passive David, a man not sure where he fits in the world. Samuel Jackson, always good, is great here; it's probably his best role that I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Robin Wright Penn also has some touching moments as Willis's despairing wife, as does Spencer Treat Clark as his neglected but loving son.The problem is not with the story or cast, but with the direction. There are some awkward transitions and some moments that should have been played out longer; it sometimes feels like Shyamalan is copping out on giving us real drama and instead giving us an outline of what happened. But no matter; it's still an intriguing movie and it has some great images. And while it may not be on par with his The Sixth Sense and Signs, it comes close, and that's good enough.",Unbreakable

Instead, it's more of a character study about David Dunn - played by Bruce Willis - a man who is the sole survivor of a train crash. Not a scratch on him. He'll find out more about himself as the movie goes on and, if you've been living under a rock, his story concludes in 2019's Glass. (I'll be looking forward to that film soon.)Without spoiling anything, it's a damn good movie. Slow, thought provoking, and clever, it tells a good story about one seemingly ordinary person can be a somewhat reluctant superhero.",Unbreakable
346,kingbad,"Disappointing, muddy follow-up",6,2 January 2001,"Those folks who really liked M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (a preposterous, but well-written, bit of Hollywood claptrap) should've been prepared for the inevitable letdown that any follow-up would produce. However, I was surprised at just how bad this movie would be. Let's face it, nobody grows to late middle age (the shaved head isn't fooling anybody, Bruce Willis!) without noticing that they never, ever get hurt, or sick, and they have super strength!! Granted, his character, David Dunn, isn't exactly the brightest bulb on the string, but even a former football player would get a clue eventually. Of course, that's why he gravitated toward security guard work, right? God knows, maybe EVERY lardassed rent-a-cop is blessed with superpowers (one of which, apparently, is total lack of ambition). And what's the deal with Samuel L. Jackson's character? Was it really necessary to dress him in purple metallic Nehru jackets and the most Godawful stupid hairstyle since Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber to sell him as a supervillain?    Dark, disappointing, and blessed with a dumb and tacked-on ""surprise"" ending; let's hope that Shyamalan's sophomore slump has passed, and he can salvage a promising career. Enough with the comic books, huh?",Unbreakable
347,ShinKyo81,"M. Night Shyamalan ""breaks"" the theaters with this film",8,14 January 2001,"M. Night Shyamalant has reached another time the audience with ""Unbreakable"", a thriller film which combines tension and brilliant performance in a brilliant production without any spectacular visual effect, because the film doesn't need it.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson combine perfectly in performance: both of them shine in front of the camera as David Dunn and Elijah Price. The photography and camera positions are another two strong points of the film; Eduardo Serra has done a brilliant job, giving to the film a strange atmosphere, like in a dream.And here's the magic of ""Unbreakable"": there are several parts where nobody talk, but the film transmits everything without words.Good plot, good ambience, brilliant performance and fantastic director are the necessary things to create a fantastic film.

348,MidnightWarrior,"Horrible film, great acting!",3,26 December 2005,"I rented this film years ago and have to say that I remember it so well because it was pretty horrible! For starters, it was very slowly paced - the movie dragged on and on and on. Secondly, if you're familiar with any of M. Night Shayaman's films, you'll be able to figure the ending out on this one pretty quickly.The film starts out with Bruce Willis being a survivor of a crash that's killed 131 people. But that's not the interesting part - the interesting part is that he has not a single scratch on him. Later he meets up with Samuel L. Jackson and learns about what it is means to be unbreakable.First off, the acting is fantastic! Bruce Willis shines on screen, as does Samuel L. Jackson (he's creepy) and some of the other actors. Unfortunately, the script is lousy and very slowly paced. Not to mention the fact that the ending is pretty transparent if you pay attention in the beginning. About 45 minutes into the film, I had guessed the ending. What did I do? I skipped to the ending and played the last couple of chapters. Yes, it turns out that I was correct.I was so angry after watching this film, that I decided to never watch any of M. Night Shayaman's films again. 3/10",Unbreakable
349,Sharkey360,One of the best films this year! Shyamalan is the man!,8,18 December 2000,"M. Night Shyamalan delivered greatness in film directing and story telling with ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999. This year, he has done it again this time around on a higher level!""Unbreakable"" is great story about a man who survived a massive train wreck who later discovers he's unbreakable, or essentially a super human who's only going to know more. Played by Bruce Willis, David Dunn's greatly portrayed with deep acting and a deep sense of discovery and reaction. Samuel L. Jackson, who's the best black actor there is today, play's fragile Elijah Price who's basically the ""breakable"" counterpart of Dunn.  Elijah's portrayed to be very knowledgeable, very interesting and very fragile to the viewer.This film reunites Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, and compared to their past team-up, this team-up here is the best I've ever seen involving them. Shyamalan really showed he can bring out the best of the 2 stars and mold it into his story. Oh, Shyamalan himself has a cameo appearance here and it's cool!Simply put, ""Unbreakable"" does not have much high-tech gimmicks, special effects, or exagerrations...it simply has one of the best stories ever told on film! There is a twist on the film's end, which I'll not reveal here. Let me just say that the twisting-end here is even better than that of ""The Sixth Sense"".""Unbreakable"" is a supernatural story that's so deep, you'll think a lot. The film is not as scary as Shyamalan's other film, but it delivers with more depth and characterization.What to do? Go to the theater's now and watch this movie! It's simply one of the best films this year! My congrats to Mr. Shyamalan!",Unbreakable
350,Here_2_Review,"Some heroes wear capes, this one wears a rain poncho",8,25 October 2018,"I can see why many considered this to be a bad movie. Maybe because it is not all actiony and brutal, among other things usually involved in a superhero film. No, this movie did not need to be all of that. There is not one single fight scene in this film. This film is a relaxed and very calm movie. Barely even any shouting in this. This film is not about violence. This film is about discovery and connection. Everybody in this film is nothing short of fantastic! It is easy to see that Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were very passionate about their parts in this very underrated blockbuster. The boy who plays Joshua is also fantastic and really knows how to be emotional when the scene calls for it, especially that scene with the newspaper! Jackson plays what I consider to be a typecast-breaking role, whereas he usually plays physical roles. In this role, he is physically vulnerable by a very large scale, although he is very intelligent, though desperate for finding the opposite end of his story, going great lengths to make his discovery. Bruce Willis NAILS his dramatic role that is the hero of this story. He is ""Superman who does not know he is Superman"", until something traumatic happens that he is involved in. After coming out of a wreck without the tiniest scratch, he discovers a new way to make a connection with his son. This movie again, is not action-based, but dramatic in its own right. It is calm, cool, and collected, with an even and slow pace with a very dark twist ending. I cannot wait to see Glass!",Unbreakable

M.Night has gone on the record saying he wanted to deliver a comic book movie without the flashy costumes and campy super-villains. And he did just that. He delivered a story that seems like it can really happen. That there are people here on earth to help those that can not help themselves, and thats a good feeling. This is one of my favorite movies.

353,compi24,"Review Of ""Unbreakable""",8,3 December 2011,"""Unbreakable"" is a 2000 M. Night Shyamalan film about David Dunne (Willis), an everyman, who becomes involved in a train wreck that leaves him mysteriously unscathed. With the help of a mysterious man (Jackson), Dunne soon learns that he is, in fact, an extraordinary man with superhuman attributes. Now, I know that the first mention of the name ""Shyamalan"" nowadays leads many people to think, "". . .ew 'The Last Airbender' "". However, there was a time when Shyamalan actually made pretty good movies. This, thankfully, is one of the only 3 he has made. ""Unbreakable"" is a truly compelling study of the narrative mechanics of comic books. I, being a big nerd who loves comic books, found this movie to be intensely interesting to watch because it clued me into things which I didn't know about them. Like the fact that a villains eyes are always portrayed to slightly bigger than the hero's because it shows that his view on the world is slightly more off-kilter than the hero's. And the fact that the hero's origin is often tied/interconnected with the villain's origin. These are just two of the many interesting concepts of comic book writing that are discussed throughout ""Unbreakable"". Now make no mistake - this movie isn't a documentary. Yes, it does discuss a lot of the methods comic book writers utilize to convey their very distinct messages, but it does this verbally and nonverbally. This movie maintains a very quiet, yet intensely brooding tone. This tone is amplified by the really somber and mesmerizing performance from Bruce Willis. The cinematography is really intelligently executed, as I found myself saying, ""oh that was pretty cool/clever"", to a very large amount of this film's shots. The ending could've used some work, but I'm sure with time I can learn to appreciate it. In the end, I found ""Unbreakable"" to be a very good film that delves deeply into some really cool subject matter.",Unbreakable
354,daved-3,eerie and thought-provoking,8,3 December 2000,"Unbreakable is a worthy follow up to Sixth Sense--it won't gross as much, obviously, but it's much better than Blair Witch II.  Shaymalan does a good job of establishing an eerie mood, and rewards your paying attention through the slow parts with a twist ending that should have you slapping your forehead saying, ""Of course!""  I figured out the twist in Sixth Sense early (honest!) but this one fooled me.  Willis is a little too low key, but still gives a solid performance.  Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as always.  I give it an 8, and look forward to Shaymalan's next film.",Unbreakable

True, Bruce Willis' voice will get distorted, but if you can persuade yourself that you're watching a dubbed foreign film, you should be all set.",Unbreakable
356,Sam_Gray,woefully underrated,10,27 December 2000,"Even though this film has a relatively good rating as of this writing, I cannot help but feel it deserves much better.I also cannot help but notice how many people are comparing Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense, which I suppose is inevitable.  What I cannot understand is that many notice the similarity in style between the two films and levy objections - even some that enjoyed The Sixth Sense.  My question is: what did these people expect?  The fact is, many directors, especially great and memorable directors, do have distinctive styles that follow them from film to film.  Consider Hitchcock, Lean, the Coen Brothers, or, to a lesser extent, Gilliam.  All of them make films that are, in some ways, similar, and all of them make films that stand apart from each other.  The same, thus far, is true of Shyamalan.  I can only suppose he is receiving such a backlash because of his high profile, but I believe this is unfair.That said, I must admit that I was worried walking into Unbreakable specifically because I did love The Sixth Sense so much.  Indeed, The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite movies, but it was the first of Shyamalan's films that I had seen (though it was not his first film as many suppose). In similar situations, I have been disappointed, such as when Frank Darabont followed The Shawshank Redemption with The Green Mile and Bryan Singer followed The Usual Suspects with Apt Pupil.Shyamalan, however, manages to retain the strengths of his style while once again exploring an established genre in a totally new way.  Unbreakable is a super hero movie, but while most films of this type are pure escapism, Shyamalan infuses his movie with an interesting theme: the nature and necessity of dichotomy.  What's really great, however, is that Shyamalan not only addresses this theme through character and plot progression, but also through the visual element.Also, I must admit I love the ending.  Indeed, I believe it's the only reasonable ending relative to the theme.  For this reason, I don't know if I would even consider it to be a ""twist.""  I do think the written epilogue is unnecessary, but that is a minor objection.Furthermore, Shyamalan's able direction is aided by a great cast.  As usual, Bruce Willis makes the perfect everyman and is easy to relate to.  And I have long been a fan of Samuel L. Jackson, who generally stands out as a great performer even in his most average films (I also can't help but respect the fact that he looks different in almost all of his films, including this one).  The two play well off of each other, Willis's average guy providing the perfect counterpoint to Jackson's eccentric.  The rest of the cast is good as well, particularly Charlayne Woodard as Jackson's mother.I admit that Unbreakable's has some flaws, particularly the convenient occupation of Willis's wife and the aforementioned epilogue.  However, these flaws are greatly overpowered by the film's strengths, and thus I am more apt to forgive them then usual.I do not often give films a ""10"" rating.  Of the 335 films I have rated at this site thus far, this is only the thirteenth.  But, I buy movies even less often, as rental is usually enough for me, and I already plan to own Unbreakable.  It is a movie that I believe demands and deserves multiple viewings.  I have already seen it twice, and I cannot wait to add it to my small personal collection.  10/10",Unbreakable

I watched it because two of my favourite actors are in it (Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson).  In a nutshell -I really liked it-.
In the beginning of the film you had no idea what was going on.  Then once things got rolling you kept thinking, ok now it is going to happen.  But of course it did not.  So suspense was built up even though it is not a mystery or thriller.  The plot kept going at a good pace without being melodramatic or boring.Some compare this movie to Sixth Sense.

This film is, in my opinion, better than both Signs and The Six Sense. The ending is quite surprising. The part where Bruce Willis's character falls into the pool is well shot (note the sinister contrast between black and red). At the beginning, Bruce talks to the woman sitting next to him and the camera captures the whole thing through a space between two seats. This scene was extremely entertaining and stylish. The themes and perhaps the characterization was lacking...the plot was fairly good...but what makes this film really great is the subtle build-up, the setting of mood with slow camera movements, the lighting, dark colors, etc.Some people here have complained that the movie is too slow. That's an okay point. I used to think many movies were slow when I was younger, but then I started doing something that fixed the problem. I simply concentrated on the dialog and tried hard to understand what the characters were saying, why they said it, how it related to any themes, etc. I don't simply tune out when characters start talking and tune back in again when the action starts.Bruce's character is able to see other people's pasts by touching them. In one remarkable scene he is standing in a train station, touching people as they walk past, looking at the dark secrets they hide.The film deals with heroes and villains, the types you find in comic books as well as virtually all movies and books (virtually every film has a hero). People would like to believe that heroes exist in real life, that heroism in the form of extreme talent is endowed on certain people. Does the concept of good versus bad apply to real life or does it just exist in fiction? Do we have to force the good versus bad concept to the real world to try make the real world more entertaining and meaningful to us?10/10",Unbreakable

362,bek-12,A Unique Comic Book Genre Movie,8,16 December 2000,"Unbreakable is a difficult movie to review without revealing the plot, and trust me, if you've not seen it you don't want the plot revealed. The plot being a surprise is the key to enjoying this movie. Knowing this, I will not reveal elements to the plot. I hope you rate me with this in mind.This story involves two men, Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis. They are opposites. Jackson plays Elijah, whose bones are brittle and even a small fall can cause fractures and breaks. As a child, he lives in fear of going outside. As an adult, he knows there is someone out there who is his opposite in every way. Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has survived one accident and tragedy after another. A man, to Elijah, who appears unbreakable. That's all you should know going into the movie. I'd strongly advise against reading details about the plot.Unbreakable is getting split reviews. Most people either love it or hate it. This makes perfect sense because of the nature of the movie. If you're a heavy-duty comic book fan, you will probably love this movie. If you care nothing about comics, you could go either way, but I am willing to bet you will consider it a bit boring at times (maybe the whole time). I think this movie relies somewhat on you being in on the ""in joke"" of comic book super-heroes. For example, Willis' character David Dunn--his initials are ""DD"". Double initials are a common trait that many older comic book characters exhibit. A few other examples are Matt Murdock (Daredevil), Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Peter Parker (Spider-Man), and Bruce Banner (The Hulk). Sure, everyone will get the gist of the movie, but comic book fans will get the most out of it.The buildup is a bit like Sixth Sense, and even more so because Bruce Willis stars in both movies. Even if you didn't know the same guy (M. Night Shyamalan) directed both movies, you could probably see a lot of similarity in the style. The same slow, intentional buildup with the same mind-bending twist at the end. Shyamalan makes a cameo appearance as a drug dealer in the stadium. Watch for him if you haven't seen the movie yet.Don't let yourself get distracted during this movie. We brought our 2 year old with us, and it was a mistake. This is the type of movie you need to settle in for, relax, and take in every word. Try to figure out what's going on. If you miss important pieces of the dialog, you're doing yourself an injustice.It's a comic book movie, but unlike anything we've seen so far. Whereas X-Men smashes the genre in your face, Unbreakable taps you lightly on the shoulder and quietly says, ""I'm a super-hero movie."" It's not obvious until the end, and depending on the viewer, sometimes not even then.From a comic book lover point of view, I'd rate it 4 out of 5 stars. From a non-comic reader viewpoint, I'd give it 3 or 4. Overall, I'm calling it a 4-star movie because I enjoyed it tremendously.",Unbreakable

365,Fredichi,Too intelligent for it's own good.,9,24 November 2000,"I'm sure most people will hate this movie. Most people in the theater were grumbling on their way out. However, I thought it was refreshingly understated and intelligent. Which given it's subject matter makes it near brilliant. It's about super heroes and comic books but it's far too slow and subtle to be a comic-book movie, yet it is laid out like one and everything is a reference to a living comic book.It really is a unique movie. It takes the exact opposite approach to the subject matter and the core of the plot than you would  expect and in result a bizarre kinetic energy is created. It flips on itself back and forth, causing infinite reflection.It has some faults but its merits far outweigh any shortcomings.The photography sometimes is a little heavy handed. The color scheme as a plot device, as in the Sixth Sense is a bit obvious but still cool.Some may argue the ending leaves a lot to desired, but I think that was the point and fits perfectly with the theme of comic books.I recommend it only if you are willing to be patient, open-minded, and you understand the comic book genre (which most people do).Definitely not as overt as the Sixth Sense. It is much more understated. Where as the subtleties in Sixth Sense made it great. This is all about subtlety.I'm pleased this wasn't just another Sixth Sense. I applaud the writer/director/producer's brave effort. Sure he could of done the same thing again, but he didn't and the movie will probably been seen as a failure because of it.",Unbreakable
366,TexMetal4JC,Fantastic and subtle,10,18 July 2001,"Unbreakable is yet another movie that seems to have polarized the audiences who have watched it. Some love the movie, others abhor it. Having seen it, I believe there is nothing here that is abhorrent at all.M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent director, first of all. His touches with the camera are near genius, a true director in the classy, manipulative style of Hitchcock and Welles. His drab, depressing colors mark easily the monotony and misery that mark David Dunn's life. As for Bruce Willis, who plays Dunn - a security guard who has never gotten sick or injured in his life: Willis is excellent in his now typical understated way, insecure and nervous. He pulls off the modern-day version of the resistent hero-to-be in fine fashion. Samuel L. Jackson -- Elijah, a fragile man with a disease that makes his bones exceptionally brittle -- is excellent in his role as the man who discovers and tries to persuade Dunn that he is the real-life version of a comicbook superhero.
Unbreakable is slow on action and long on plot. And this is by no means a derogatory comment. Although the dialogue is predominant, it adds to the story and is interesting, making this one of the few post-computer revolution movies not to use gun battles or explosions as a mainstay of its plot. Indeed, Shyamalan seems to purposely avoid such distractions by not even showing the opening train crash, instead using the TV news to describe it. The twist ending is wonderful and delightfully Hitchcockian. Indeed, the pace and mood of this movie rings of 40s and 50s-era Hitchcock. The only potential problem is that Shyamalan is now typecast as a suspence/thriller director who throws in absurd and shocking plot twists at the end of his movies (sound familiar?). Will this be able to last, or will Shyamalan break the mold before it gets set? After all, even Hitchcock made an occasional ""Juno and the Paycock"".10/10",Unbreakable
367,illegal_alien51,Wow what a bummer!,1,8 May 2004,"*Spoilers?* Just another of Mr. Shyamalan's motion pictures full with illogical presumptions and other stuff you don't actually want to see in good movies!I think Shyamalan hasn't really understood the essence of good movie making, he doesn't see the depth of it, but he admires a lot of great movie makers and is good at copying other directors and ideas, but he isn't capable of making this one a good movie by himself and by these means, maybe because he seems to do everything himself.There are so many things which don't really do any good for the story:How could that Elijah character come up with specifically David Dunn being a superhero? I guess there are a few people like Dunn who had lucky escapes, how could he be so sure it would be Dunn? Shyamalan worked on the presumption of WANTING to have Dunn be a superhero, so he went to great lengths to MAKE him one through presenting circumstantial evidence. Everybody knows that circumstantial evidence isn't normally enough to prove anything, but after enough circumstantial evidence is presented Shyamalan presumes he has PROVEN enough and just goes on with the story. That just leaves a big hole!How at all did Elijah come to the assumption of there being real superheroes? Well I don't really got that at all! What stuck though was a very a very stupid explanation or whatever it was meant to be that ancient Egyptian writing was somehow connected to today's comic books. Silly in a sad way!How in hell could a normal person like Dunn never have noticed that he wasn't ever sick or ill or damaged in any way? How would he need somebody who had never met him before to tell him that, with the result of Dunn finding out that that was the truth? Absolutely ridiculous!Water! Again! Water seems to play a big roll in Shyamalan's movies or at least slightly because it felt like if water would have some climax role in this movie, but instead it became a very unnecessary and pointless swimming pool scene with absolutely no connection to anything important before or after!The scene with the boy and the gun! What a waste of true drama! But where do such ideas come from, what events lead up to such dramatically enormous and powerful moments and what happens with those in the aftermath? Answer: The boy just had the gun and just had to point it at his father because he had to prove a point! What a completely chopped off way of putting drama into the movie! The boy could have been shown during the time he came up with the idea. His idea could have been explained and put into perspective! The boy should have been going through some kind of struggle with his conscience before doing that extreme thing, but no! He just gets the gun and points it at his father! The next freaked out thing was that the father shouted at the boy with the gun AFTER having tried a calm approach. A little more intelligent person would have known not to agitate or stress that boy any further in an aggressive way so that the boy wouldn't switch over into an aggressive-defence mode and in the process shoot the father by accident! Next: All just break down and sigh a little, instead of springing into action! The father should have gotten very angry at the boy, maybe even slapped him  just out of stress and relief at the same time! I'm not saying that that would have been cool or nice, but it would have been a bit more realistic, but what we instead see next time all of them are together is a scene that would actually make us believe nothing of that had ever happened and that it was forgotten and never spoken about. The wife didn't even tell Dunn to not leave the gun in the house anymore! Outrageously bad!The list just goes on and on and on such things just pile up to a big mountain of nasty smelly stuff! Shyamalan seems to work in such a way that he knows that he wants certain elements in the movie, lets say an interesting idea and then some drama and here and there filmed from certain angles and such. Then he comes up with the interesting idea, then he tries extremely hard to explain his (in the end rather ridiculous) interesting idea by means of circumstantial evidence (because he himself can grasp the depth which would be needed to make his idea credible) and tries again and again. In the end he throws all scenes together, knitting those together with lose pieces of drama and that's it. So what you end up with is not a natural building of social storytelling structure, but some kind of chopped up salad in which you as the viewer must piece everything together yourself. And you are very lucky (or in fact unlucky, and I don't envy you if you do) if you manage to do so without compromising the viewing experience!
To visualize what I mean a bit more: Whenever the family is together or whenever Dunn and his wife meet there seems to be one topic on the table which doesn't really fully connect to anything they have recently been going on about, but it still advances the story because it is something new. The problem is that these advances are too big! Shyamalan tells you mostly about the waypoints in the story, NOT about the interesting and deep things: exactly HOW a character came up with his ideas, assumptions and reasons. And that is something utterly too easy, a cheap way out and it is not real story telling. It is like reading the back of the book. It kills the characters giving the idea of the movie all the space.Bummer!3/10",Unbreakable
368,fiozinho,Unbearable.,4,8 February 2001,"Actually, that's not entirely true - I actually like the slow, atmospheric, mysterious build-up in this film, David searching for the reason for his existence, the doubting, the incomprehension. And some of the set-pieces are excellent - the conversation on the train; the harrowing chase down the subway steps; David's visit to Elijah's gallery, his head silhouetted against a table lamp and giving him a halo; the pool scene. But per-lease - yet another tricky twist at the end? It's like one of those shaggy-dog stories that we used to tell as kids, and everyone groans at the punch-line. Night Shyamalan has to get out of this rut next time round or they'll be calling him a one-trick pony.",Unbreakable
369,cToTh-2,Pleasantly surprised,7,2 September 2001,"I rented this movie mainly because there was nothing else I wanted to rent, but I must say that the movie was better than expected.Personally, I liked the comic book references and comparisons.  I was once a comic book collector back in the 90's, and so my interest in the movie peaked at the notion of someone being a superhero (or rather a superhuman, since Bruce Willis seemed to be ""unbreakable"" and since he possessed a (forgive the pun) sixth sense for discovering unethical people).Watching the commercials back several months ago, I did not realize then that the comic book industry or views were so entangled with the plot of the movie.  Had I known this, I might have watched the movie either in the theatres or as soon as it was released.Obviously, if the viewing public were told that this movie was about comic books (or rather they helped develop the plot), the movie would have likely been less successful and lost integrity.  After all (excluding Batman and the X-Men), who would want to shell out $7 - $10 in a movie theatre to see a movie about comic books or comic book characters?  Does Punisher ring a bell?7/10 stars.",Unbreakable
370,mjhalta,A thinking man's movie,8,21 July 2006,Those movie fans who did not grow up reading comics or who require at least 10 dead mutilated bodies per minute will find this movie slow moving and incomprehensible. As for me I reveled in it. I have read stacks of comics and understand the battle of Ying and Yang going on daily as it has been revealed to me through this wonderful medium. In the tradition of a good comic and with a subtle touch M Night Shyamalan brings us a story of the reluctant hero slowly emerging into a very scary reality. He has hid from that reality his whole life. Samual L. Jackson is superb in his role as the Arch Villain trying to find meaning for his life. Hollywood has finally picked up the Super Hero/Super Villain golden egg. Which one of us has not dreamed of having super powers. Unbreakable is part of this emerging gendra of film and a novel one at that. The explosion of Super Hero movies has just begun.,Unbreakable

This could have been a MUCH better move if it had been made by any one other then Shyamalan, this hack has never done a movie I liked, they are always so predictable you could sleep through the first half and still know the whole story line. Why do they keep giving this man money to make these turds?

372,supah79,Just fantastic,9,12 September 2005,"Willis finds out some strange things about himself after being the sole survivor in a train wreck. Jackson tells him he's special. Is he really? Unbreakable really is an act 1 superhero story stretched to feature lenght (Night tells us in an interview). Genius. For once I believe Willis is the person on screen, not that he's playing Bruce Willis, the cool actor. Night uses colors (mostly blue, purple and green) and well chosen camera-angles as imagesystems (word is that the storyboard read like a comic). Most of them really work out well. I loved the slow pacing of the film. It really takes it time to tell us what's going on. As usual Shyamalan puts human drama first in his script. The first scene where Willis meets the woman in the train... You have to see the genius of it. In a few lines of dialog Shyamalan let's us discover the character Dunn.Another reason why I love this film is because Shyamalan shows he has courage to make THIS after the enormous success of The Sixth Sense, which I think is inferior to this film. I just know the studio execs where pushing for something more tangible than this, but he chose this instead. A homage to comic books. And it works! BEAUTIFUL!!",Unbreakable

The viewer is kept in suspense from the beginning and intrigued with the mystery of ""Who is David Dunn?""  ""Why doesn't he even know himself?""  ""What can he do?"" ""What WILL he do?""  The direction contributes to the mood and I believe that M. Night will be nominated for Best Director and also Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards.  The beginning sequence is perfectly put together, camera angles, mood, conversation, building suspense through the use of sound to a trainwreck that we never actually see, but have experienced already in our imaginations.  The score also enhances our experience at just the right moments.  The acting is adequate; Bruce Willis does not deliver his lines with much conviction sometimes, but his facial expressions more than make up for that.If there is a weak part of the film, I would say that it is the relationship between David and his wife.  A little too much time is spent letting us know that there is something not quite right there.

374,hedin_88,"a work of art, not entertainment",10,2 March 2008,"A lot of people say that this movie is bad. Well, its one of my favorite ones. First of all, it does something Hollywood stopped doing a long time ago and that is to create art rather than entertainment. Its all about the money nowadays, how much a movie will spend and make. This one goes the completely in the other direction. Its emphasis is on the directing as a frame rather than directing action sequences and its more important to make the characters real through acting than through their actions. Its different kind of directing makes it interesting to watch. The scenes are long, filmed from angles that makes you think how the camera is just thrown into a place from where its filming. The dialogs are slow and it really tests your nerves. Be prepared for great acting and almost no action as you might be used to. The whole story happens through intense camera movements and dialogs. Its 'super hero' idea is nothing like other movies about super heroes.If you like art, this movie is definitely for you, but if you're in for the thrill and action, you'll get bored.",Unbreakable
375,Jeremy-93,"very well made, but curiously stupid",6,9 October 2003,"""Unbreakable"" is an extremely well-crafted film. The acting is mostly terrific, with Bruce Willis cementing his position as almost the only actor who can convincingly fill a certain kind of role: an unpretentious, quiet, blue-collar man, no intellectual but also no fool, well-meaning but no saint. As in ""The Sixth Sense"", he is on quiet, controlled form here, but in this film he's more regularly the centre of attention, and he's sufficiently magnetic to carry it off.  Samuel L. Jackson, the perfect Tarantino actor, also excels in a completely different, much more restrained aesthetic.The production is in many ways as good as the performances: measured, pretty dour and unvarnished. Within individual scenes the writing is usually fine, and some of the staging is memorably done - although the director's obsession with precise storyboarding does yield a certain inertia, making this largely a film of fluent compositions rather than dramatic scenes. The trouble is that all this sophisticated film-making can't disguise the fundamental lack of intelligence behind it. It's not that the plot is silly or the idea self-evidently implausible -- that is very rarely a problem so long as the film is made with conviction -- it's just that the idea isn't illuminating, it doesn't tell us much about anyone or anything. Its impression of seriousness is bogus.The family drama which occupies the foreground most of the time is in fact incredibly ordinary: if you imagine this story shorn of its fantastical elements, it would barely pass muster as a TV movie of the week; and (more damagingly) that family story is in no way enriched or even much affected by the journeys taken by Willis's and Jackson's characters. And I don't even think that this film tells us much about comic books or superhero origin stories -- certainly little that isn't squeezed into the opening couple of minutes of Ang Lee's ""The Ice Storm"" (itself no masterpiece). It's very strange to see so much professionalism and care in all departments lavished on such a thin, underwhelming, half-baked idea for a movie.",Unbreakable
376,evilasahobby,Another great film from M. Night S.,9,25 February 2002,"Unbreakable is a film you will either love or hate. People who love it point to the great acting, the strong characterisation, the original plot (among others) to prove its superiority. Critics will talk about how slow the film is, how stupid the plot, how it makes very little sense (among others) in discussing the film's flaws. As someone who loved this film, I find it hard to reconcile the two viewpoints, but can see where the opposition is coming from.***Possible Spoiler***It all comes down to one point: can you accept a superhero theme in a serious film? It has been my experience a lot of people can't. It seems that people will accept ghosts (as in M. Night S.'s other film, The Sixth Sense) without hesitation, but unless a superhero has their underwear on the outside, it makes no sense, or is stupid. Unbreakable (like The Sixth Sense) places the extraordinary right in the middle of the ordinary, and asks us to accept it.I could, and found this a great, slow burn kind of film. It builds over time, working in time with Bruce Willis' working joe as he brings himself to maybe believe that Samuel L. Jackson's character may be telling the truth. Yes, I saw the ending coming, but couldn't pick the ""how"" or ""why"". It isn't a crushing twist like The Sixth Sense, but when it hits, a new light is shed on the film and its events.Overall, this film is much stronger than The Sixth Sense, but it asks a greater suspension of belief. If anything, it cements M. Night S. as a director to watch.",Unbreakable

Now that I've seen it I understand it was perhaps the director's intention to make the audience watch the movie a couple of times in order to fully enjoy it... They could have invented a better explanation to why the main character is unbreakable and explored it sooner. The end feels rushed but there are no significant loose ends. It is a movie that one can enjoy watching but not particularly remarkable in any way. That is why I gave it a 6 out of 10.",Unbreakable
378,Lunchbox-8,"Satisfactory, Unique Film",8,20 January 2001,"""Unbreakable,"" written and directed by the creator of ""The Sixth Sense,"" was a good movie.  Although the plot was somewhat slow and the big action scenes were few and far between, it came out good in the end.  ""Unbreakable"" is the story of a man with a unique power and a man who tries to inform him of it.  As I already said, the plot was pretty slow.  At some times i even consisdered walking out of the movie because I thought the plot was wandering.  Some scenes involve Bruce Willis trying to recconcile his marriage and come off as pretty boring.  You do grow to like the characters though, just like in ""The Sixth Sense.""  You can absolutely tell that the writer and director is the same guy from ""The Sixth Sense"" for two reasons.  The first reason is that the movie has plenty scenes which wander from the plot and focus on the lives of the characters instead of the matter at hand. Some scenes are just times when the characters are silent, thinking about something, and leaving the audience waiting for some action, just like in ""The Sixth Sense.""  These scenes aren't exactly bad, if that's the impression you're getting, because they help you to think of the characters more as people, people you might know or meet at the supermarket, instead of people in a movie.  These scenes also wander away from the plot, and prevent you from thinking of the surprise ending, and what could happen.  For example, all those scenes with Bruce Willis and his wife in ""The Sixth Sense"" made you think of them, and the healing of their marriage, instead of realizing the truth about Bruce Willis.    The second reason that let's you know that ""Unbreakable"" was created by the writer and director of ""The Sixth Sense"" is the ending.  Don't worry, I won't give away the big ending like a lot of people probably did in ""The Sixth Sense.""  In fact, I think the writer purposely made the ending more complicated than in it's predecessor so no one would give it away.  And believe me, you won't know it.  I bet the entire movie you'll be thinking about the ending, and about how you could figure it out, but you won't.  M. Night Shamaylan just pulled the carpet out from under you- I mean this is ""The Usual Suspects"" style.  Well, I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes long drawn out movies with fabulous endings.                              My Rating: 8/10",Unbreakable
379,azemillancy,A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO CLICHE,8,28 April 2021,"Superhero movies are one of the most cliche containing films of all time! But M. Night Shyamalan the writer and director of this film done it in a different way. In an experimental way, it's something so different. Almost all the superhero movies out there are in the same format. There will be a superhero and the villian with big evil intentions to destroy the world, cause harm to people or for any other thing, and in the end the superhero will defeat him! End of the story...
But in Unbreakable the superhero doesn't even know that he has got superhuman abilities. He is shown as just a normal human(in terms of his behaviour and activites) until he realises that he has certain capabilities. Only in the scene in which he saves people gives him a superhuman form. The superhero's greatest enemy the villian is the one who intentionally said to the protagonist that he is a superhuman, and that's something I have never witnessed ever before. The villian needs a superhero to fight because he is so obsessed with superhero comic books.The dark and mysterious atmosphere the movie has got is simply wonderful and a major factor in lifting the level of this movie, without this the film would have been so blank.It's a must watch!",Unbreakable

As such, I won't write anything about the plot--the movie synopsis will do that job without giving much away.I will say I liked the movie, but was disappointed that it was not better. There are some excellent elements (like Willis and Jackson's personas), and a deep, subtle, ominous tone throughout that I found honest and true to the movie's concept. Unfortunately, because of this quiet, understated story being told, Shyamalan is forced to keep the movie at a rather slow, almost boring pace that will probably turn most people off the deeper personal issues. It is only the potential of the characters, and through them, the movie, that keeps us interested.Anyway, it worked for me.

Night Shyamalan, who got away with his spiritual, ghosty script in The Sixth Sense. That was creative and intriguing with an original surprise ending. But this whole movie is a set-up for an ending that never arrives. In fact, at least half a dozen times throughout the movie, I thought maybe here is where this film will come alive. But it never materializes! Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are together for the first time since Pulp Fiction. Bad Kharma! Jackson still has his Pulp Fiction hairdo and Shaft overcoat and he attempts to create a lovably, crippled character who is in actuality a serial murderer. In fact, Jackson doesn't do much besides the delivery of his lines. He seems terribly bored throughout. And Willis, although he seems to be trying, is playing a character who has never been sick a day in his life and yet has never come to that realization. He should have had this script burned. Suspension of disbelief never occurs and I felt thoroughly ripped-off. Don't waste your time going to see this abomination.

387,abhijith-alpha,UNBREAKABLE: MY REVIEW,7,4 February 2019,"It is not a superhero origin story. Well, it kind of is, but it is not as simple as that. This is a well-crafted drama about a man going through a mid-life crisis. David Dunn is a security guard who works whatever jobs he can find. He has a son with his high school/college sweetheart and later wife, Audrey. Audrey and David are going through a tough time and it seems like the marriage is about to fall apart, much to the disappointment of their son.Seems pretty straightforward, yes? Actually, no. We don't find out any of this until about half an hour in. We open with David on a train, returning from yet another failed job hunting expedition. He tries to flirt unsuccessfully with a sports agent, discreetly removing his wedding ring before initiating contact.
The train meets an accident, and only David has survived. Audrey, played with great sensitivity and tenderness by Robin Wright, tries to meet David halfway at the chance to restore their marriage and hopefully, the faded romance. It is a beautiful story in itself.Enter Elijah Price, a cool, brilliant comic book historian and collector, who is intrigued by David's story, and tries to encourage him to explore his powers. Turns out, Price suffers from a rare disease which results in extreme fragility of his skeletal structure. He believes that Dunn and he are on the opposite ends of the spectrum, him being acutely delicate and Dunn being unbreakable.In spite of dismissing Price's theories as fantastical and telling his son that he's just an ordinary man, David gradually starts honing his special skills, asking his son to promise not to tell Audrey.I would stop here for the enjoyment of the movie is in experiencing it. It was apparently not well received when it came out in 2000. Shyamalan was ahead of the superhero boom by a decade, but it's not just that. This movie is not a conventional superhero movie even by today's standards. Shyamalan has weaved a poignant family drama into a superhero/supervillain origin story, that is unconventional up to the end. There is no exploding, blockbuster heroics. There is rich characterization and examination of ordinary lives of people, among them two who have extraordinary abilities.I cannot not marvel at Shyamalan's ablity to create mood appropriate to the context. This is independent moviemaking at its finest. The director to serve his story utilizes the presence of two blockbuster stars in Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, and the equally talented Robin Wright.THOUGHT AND OTHER STUFF:Damn Elijah Price is a cold customer. His intelligence and thinly-disguised contempt at the rest of the world is cleverly portrayed by Jackson.Bruce Willis, in his everyman hero role once again before going through a lean phase in the 2000s. I haven't seen The Assassination of a High School President, otherwise he had no good movies except Sin City in 2005 and Die Hard 4 in 2007. The Willissance would have to wait till Red (2010).Robin Wright, such a performer. I can't believe Hollywood didn't fully utilize her talent until House of Cards came by.Intense movie. To be watched when you have some clarity in mind and preferably not on a train.VERDICTDirection: 8

In my view, too much time is spent developing the theme of the movie before the action starts...and then ends making you feel like you were cheated, but you weren't. However, the movie is very absorbing, I liked the use of colors and the fact that the trailer didn't give away the story of the movie.

Yes I know that's not saying alot, since this has been one of the worst years in movies since the 80's, but Unbreakable is a really top notch movie.  I just want to warn all of you that do goto see this movie, DO NOT GO IN EXPECTING TO SEE A REPEAT OF THE SIXTH SENSE! Yes this is a real thinking movie, yes it's got one hell of a twist for and ending, but this movie has nothing to do with dead people.  This is a movie that goes into a much more surreal environment, the world of comics, but the way M. Night Shyamalan does it, is incredible, not once did I feel like I was watching some cheesy flick and expect people to have bullets bounce off their chest or fly thru the air and to make you feel better, it doesn't happen.  I really spent the whole time just watching and waiting to see how it unfolds. I will not deny, sixth sense didn't take much to figure out what was going on, I knew the answer half way thru the movie, but Unbreakable, doesn't end with an answer in that way, it ends with probably the most incredible eye popper I've ever seen in a movie.See the movie! I can't wait to get the DVD, this is one of those movies, like, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) and Usual Suspects, The (1995) where I can watch over and over and I know I'll just keep picking up those little visuals and pieces of dialouge that I didn't notice before.",Unbreakable
390,Kelt Smith,UNREACHABLE is More Like It !!!,5,28 July 2001,"Much of the promotion of UNBREAKABLE informed the public that this movie would have the same writer/director as 1999's SIXTH SENSE,the same male lead, BRUCE WILLIS. That in mind, we were downright told that we were being treated to another ""new style"" of thriller. Afterall, SIXTH SENSE kept most of its audiences guessing up to the end, just like HITCHCOCK films did decades ago until the masses finally figured out HITCH's alternating plot lines. With clever new writer/director on the horizon M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN, I figured that he would keep us entertained for sometime. It can take sometime to learn what makes someone tick, to decipher their tricks, and when you have a talented writer in your midst, you want to relish them. So if you enjoyed the SIXTH SENSE and think that you're in for a surefire thriller that you will enjoy, well think again.... As a director SHYAMALAN is very crafty and has lots of style. He knows how to build impending doom,disaster. At times he almost overbuilds this tension, particularly when he has nothing to back it up with as is the case of UNBREAKABLE. UNREACHABLE is more like it. Like WELLES who had the mountainous task of topping 1941's CITIZEN KANE, SHYAMALAN really should have taken his time with his follow up project. The storyline of UNBREAKABLE slowly, and I do mean slowly, begins to build where the audience will try to keep tally of the clues to conclude the outcome. The problem with this movie is that as a completed motion picture, SHYAMALAN has failed miserably as a writer on this movie. You can overlook credibility when you are so awed by a clever concept. There is nothing clever about this climax, it is downright odious ! When SAMUEL L. JACKSON reveals to BRUCE WILLIS how and why they fit into each other's life, WILLIS looks as if he has just been told who was behind JFK's assassination. Watching this dud on video with several friends, we looked at each other right after JACKSON's 'revelation', and in unison we said, ""What a let-down !"" Personally, I was hoping that WILLIS was going to slip into his DIE HARD character, whip out his gun, shoot the wheelchair bound JACKSON right in the forehead while simultaneously exclaiming, ""Yippy Kiya Moth&@ F*#k%r !"" Watch at your own risk for there's definitely more style than substance ! ! !",Unbreakable
391,David_Niemann,The Sux Sense,7,11 June 2003,"David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is the only survivor in a horrific train trash. Remarkably he doesn't break a bone, or even have a scratch on him. On the other end of the scale is Elijah Prince (Samuel L. Jackson), whose bones are as brittle as glass. Elijah thinks the two have a special bond, total opposites. David thinks not. But upon thinking about the situation, and having some revelations, David starts thinking that Elshia might be right. But is he just falling into a trap or does he really have remarkable powers, the gift of being 'unbreakable'?I am a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", so I was always very interested in seeing ""Unbreakable"".While I enjoyed most of the film, I ultimately left the film with a huge feeling of disappointment.There are several scenes that are just totally contrived, such as the 'kid with gun' scene. How that cut made it into the final edit, I have no idea! And the weight-lifting scene just goes on and on. And a few plot hole/inconsistencies really played on my mind. When I first heard about the plot I thought it sounded really interesting. But while watching the film the premise ran around my mind, and I started getting really bothered by it.Setting that aside, the film offers some intrigue. And the beginning is quite interesting. However the film is really let down by the end. We have to endure a really long, quite pointless scene. And then the twist! The 'Sixth Sense' this ain't. While it is slightly creepy, it was kind of predictable and ultimately unsatisfying. While looking back at it, it seems rather ridiculous.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
And what is with ripping off ""The Dead Zone""? If his bones are unbreakable fine, but what is up with touching people and seeing things. That whole story-line seemed very under-written and got quite boring. If this premise was talked about earlier, than that would have been OK (if a little unbelievable). But to spring this on us so late. Thats not good.*** END OF SPOILER ***Bruce Willis comes across as not very good. Though Samuel L. Jackson is as good as ever. The supporting cast don't provide sterling performances, though nothing really bad. There are some nice looking scenes. My favorite being the comic book store (not Elisha's ""Limited Edition""), very dark and stylish. And the photography is quite nice. The music score, however, is forgettable.This isn't a really bad film, just very disappointing. A lot of the good scenes are stained by the poor ones. If it was the only thing on television on a rainy Saturday afternoon I would probably give it another outing. But I certainly won't be going out of my way to see it again.7/10",Unbreakable

It isn't clear for most of the movie just how much of a role each genre plays in this film. It's much more of an adult drama than a superhero movie, so comic book fans may feel bored and under-stimulated. And yet, the superhero aspect is ultimately so important that less fantasy-minded viewers may have trouble suspending their disbelief. This film is made for people who, on the one hand, believe in the importance of pop culture and the reflective importance of the sort of media that the literati may conventionally think of as ""low art"": comics, music videos, science-fiction stories...and, on the other hand, the same people must be in touch with the difficulties of a real life, a life where any fantastic or possibly fantastic elements are typically eclipsed by harsh realities: disease, serious injury, divorce, and the regret of having made a very wrong and very important decision many years ago.Despite a few painfully obvious flaws (the titles at the beginning and the end being the worst), this film is a beautiful work, an engaging story that floats on a fine mixture of sadness and bittersweet hope.",Unbreakable
395,Pigbelly,Unbearable,1,24 January 2006,"Sitting through this tripe was a painful experience. The childish, simplistic and frankly idiotic attempt at creating duality between a ""breakable"" man and an ""unbreakable"" one makes me want to puke. Honestly, my puke would have more interesting to watch than this puerile nonsense. Comic books do not translate well into movies and this is a prime example of why directors should stop trying. I have rarely been so conscious that I was in a movie theater watching a really bad film other than maybe squirming through the awful Sin City (another comic book conversion disaster). When my friends and I left the theater after seeing Unbreakable, we were all speechless until a good friend (and fellow critic) turned to me and uttered ""unbearable"". This is the perfect catchphrase for this smelly turd of a film. Unbearable.",Unbreakable
396,rust37,The best movie on comics subject,9,15 December 2004,"Unbreakable got me after seeing it the 3rd time thus completing the list of very few films, which are capable of making tears out of my cynical soul, which is not easy to disturb. This is of course a movie about supernatural power and comics, but do not expect too much in this extent - Bruce Willis will not climb the buildings or catch bullets with teeth. No extraordinary visual or special effects, CGI, etc.The Unbreakable is actually a drama about middle-age crisis of man (Bruce Willis), who lost the sense of living after sparing career for early marriage. He blames himself, his wife (Robin Wright Penn). He lives in a slow dream, each day waking up in sadness. Gradual discover of his supernatural abilities and possessions with the help of freaky Mr.Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) leads him towards finding his way and reunites the family. The second dimension of Unbreakable is about supernatural powers with some philosophy about their balance, karma, etc., which is closely connected to the drama background.The keyword of the Unbreakable is ""sadness"", which makes this film from the very beginning up to the moment, when Dunn's wife says ""bad dream is over now"". The feeling is strengthened by excellent performance and dark bluish picture. The Unbreakable is almost as sad as the American Beauty and Magnolia.The next keyword is ""kids' psychology"". The most criticised here scene with the gun is logical, believable and one of the best in the movie. Kids are easy to believe that their fathers are superheroes. They need this for setting their reference points, and for having any advantage to demonstrate it to another kids in the course of their social games. The power of childhood issues and fears (MNS movies are well stuffed with his childhood imprintings) is illustrated perfect.I would rather mark as unnecessary the scene with Dunn is visiting hangar with the remainders of the train. It adds nothing apart from flashback, which could be inserted anywhere else without having security guard breaching public property in background.Yet another point of criticism is slow pace. A movie could be labeled as one if there actually nothing happens or there is no development for a long time. From this point of view Unbreakable is not a slow one. Each minute there is an action or new development in either drama or supernatural dimensions. The script by MNS is wonderful - each detail matters, no visible lousy ends. Camera work deserves special appraisal - no great achievements, but lot's of tricks, and fresh angles. Meaningful soundtrack contributes towards building very special atmosphere.Shyamalan's brave of taking comics, which is quite sensitive subject for American audience as a basis for supernatural movie and making very different one compared to Spidermen, etc. deserves extra mark.9/10",Unbreakable
397,cosmicfish14,His 2nd Best Movie,7,20 July 2015,"So continuing Shyamalan month we will now review what many consider his ""2nd best movie"" Unbreakable. And I would have to agree on that, even though there are some strange aspects. But we will go over that later on.One thing to keep in mind is that this isn't a very fast moving film, it very slowly paced. But I honestly like a super hero based story line that can run a little slower than most of the action films of that time. Also I think the pace helps create a mysterious atmosphere. Also this is one of the few Shyamalan movies where I actually enjoyed the twist ending. I won't spoil it, but I think its very fitting.There are some weird things about the movies. There was the whole unnecessary M Night Shyamalan cameo, some of the acting was kinda lame, and the pace at times did feel a bit to slow. Also there were a few continuity errors I noticed through out the story. Probably the thing that bugged me the most was that there was some of that pretentious Shyamalan dialogue about ""everything has a purpose"" and what not. But those are really the only big problems I have.Even though it is very flawed, I think Unbreakble is still a movie you should see for its atmosphere and mystery, and it is incredibly engrossing even with these flawsFinal Score:7.5/10",Unbreakable
398,Rimmer-10,Really enjoyed this one,8,29 January 2001,"This movie is overall a great one. Stellar performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis. But the real gem is the camera work which I have not seen anything like in the past. Especially the scene where the young ""Mr. Glass"" opens his present from his mom. Here the camera goes around his head 540 degrees along with him turning the present. Also when he stands on top of the flight of stairs. The zoom out is absolutely brilliant and very effective.The ending really caught me off guard.Rating: 8 of 10.",Unbreakable
399,korch-3,What if Comics Were Real?,8,20 September 2001,"I have been a fan of comics all my life. I have always wondered what if there were really superheros? What would they be like? Would they fit in, or would they be considered freaks? I think Unbreakable portrays how a superhero would find out he is actually one, and how he responds to it rather accurately. Of course this is just speculation, but it sure comes off very believable.I have heard many grumble that this movie was too slow and boring.  I did not feel that way. I thought this movie was a great throwback to great directing like Alfred Hitchcock's films. I am not a professor of film, but I know I like the way the movie feels. The pacing, the dialogue, the cinematography..... it all feels right to me.",Unbreakable
400,Fredericmignard,APPALLING,2,4 February 2001,There are movies that shouldn't be done and unbreakable is unfortunately one of those. Its stupid story gathers the worst flaws. It has a fascist story in which the fight between good and evil looks like a fight in favour of death penalty. The basic opposition between the colors black and white is used again for ambiguous reasons. Well definitively not of a film for the French who are having a great laugh in the theaters programming this nasty flick.,Unbreakable
401,mr_walsh,Thoroughly Entertaining,9,26 November 2000,"Of course many will compare this to ""6th Sense"", and there is indeed more than one similarity.  If you liked one you're sure to love the other.  I actually prefer 'Unbreakable' because the greatness spread across the entire movie, not concentrated on the ending as in ""6th Sense"".  Excellently written by which the fantasy and wonder of comics became believable plot elements in a brilliant way.  Great acting all around, and wonderfully filmed.A Bruce Willis note:  I like Bruce Willis.  Ever notice his best roles (""6th Sense"", ""12 Monkeys"", even ""Die Hard"") feature him as a misunderstood outcast.  I understand in Hollywood he's a bit on the outside especially due to his rare republican beliefs.  Could he be drawing on this rejection by his peers?",Unbreakable
402,ozymandiaskingofkings,shyamalans finest,9,11 July 2006,"Now let me start by saying I am not really an M. Night Shyamalan fan. While I respect his skills as an excellent director I have always thought of him as being a Hitchcock wannabe who comes up with a great concept and throws it all away on a wacky twist.I liked ""Sixth Sense"" as the film and the twist were superbly crafted, beautifully shot and thought provoking, but as for his other films its another matter. ""Signs"" for all its skillful setup promised failed to deliver bigtime, with the plausibility of aliens allergic to water invading a planet 80% covered by it as stretched as Gibson's hammy acting. ""The Village"" for all its Crucible-esquire finery and post 9/11 politics I also found disappointing because not only did i guess the twist fairly early on in the film (I think it was the ""forbidden chest"" in Sigourney Weaver's house), but the supernatural ambiguity that formed the backbone of the film was removed halfway dispelling any intrigue that I had remaining.""Unbreakable"", however, may be Shyamalan's finest work to date. By posing a simple yet tantalizing question ""what if superheroes existed in the real world?"" we are drawn in to a truly fascinating film with a mature philosophical subtext.The protagonist David Dunn (given an alliterative name like all great superhero aliases) is fascinating because he is so ordinary, an everyman whose seemingly pre-ordained purpose is a mystery even to him: is he the messiah? Is he extremely lucky? Or is he a superhero? Asking these questions is Elijah Price, a comic book obsessive cursed with extremely brittle bones seeking to mentor Dunn and make him a hero, believing him and Dunn to be opposites. Enthrallingly played by Samuel L Jackson, Price is a fascinating character and the psychological complexity given to him means when the twist reveals his true motives, the impact is a numbing experience.The world these two inhabit is no Gotham either, it is the real world in all its sinister glory, the crime David solves, not an unhinged pantomime supervillain but a rapist and murderer; Superman this ain't.overall, this film is almost an exploration of what it means to be human, psychologically, existentially and philosophically and seems to conclude what David Bowie has all along: ""We can be heroes, just for one day"".5/5",Unbreakable
403,Bondo20,Thrilling puzzle where every piece fits.,9,2 August 2001,"From the director of The Sixth Sense, there were expectations fromthis movie that most wouldn't live up to but Unbreakable does wellin many ways surpassing them.  The plot is surreal but it comesoff as very believable and the stunning ending is surprising but fitsperfectly.  The only thing I would want changed about the movie isto have a little more about Bruce Willis' character as he developsinto his new role.  The movie was short enough that adding thatwouldn't make it lengthy.  As is though it is one of the best moviesI've seen.",Unbreakable
404,stevenleadbetter,Clearly not been fixed.,4,7 November 2001,"Interesting. Proof that lightning does not in fact strike twice in the same spot. M.Knight Shyamlan and Bruce Willis collaborate again in this drama about a man who suddenly realises that he cannot be injured and he's actually a modern day superhero. Samuel L Jackson is responsible for Willis coming to this rather lofty conclusion.  The direction is superb, the acting not so. 'The Sixth Sense' was an absolute joy and this was never going to be even close to being on a par with that little gem. No Haley Joel Osment for a start, though the token child star copes quite admirably. The difference in quality is startling, however. I'm left with the impression the Mr Shyamlan really had to make 'The Sixth Sense' extremely good in order to make a name for himself. After that worked perfectly well, he seems to have lapsed into a 'let's get it in the can' mentality. The picture, though not short, finishes way too early and it seems on first seeing the film, that the budget was eaten up fairly early, and they had been wracking their brains to come up with a quick ending that wouldn't prove to be too expensive. They appear to have achieved this, to the detriment of the picture, unfortunately. I expected something far less sloppy and hastily pasted up.",Unbreakable
405,tone143,Bit of a miscarriage?,5,13 August 2003,"This movie had such a strange intensity to it,I was quite sucked in.Too bad about the ending.The whole eugenics thing,a madman winnowing the numbers down in order to find ""The One"",seemed somewhat shocking and confusing for 9 seconds,but came off as truncated and begging for more story(or a sequel?).The sudden shift from mystery and abstraction to a linear obviousness didn't work for me.",Unbreakable
406,spitfire2356,Beyond bad,1,14 October 2013,"I was really disappointed with this movie. Really, really disappointed. I had been so impressed with the 'Sixth sense' that I thought Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson magic plus Shyamalan would conjure something just as memorable. The premise of the plot was bottom of the barrel desperate in its possibility. A person with superhuman strength does not need his small boy to tell him and actually show him how strong he is! How a man with superhuman strength and touch cognition can stick to a wimpy woman, obey her whims and settle for a stupid job is beyond any suspension of belief. He does not even know that he is never sick - he has to ask her. People with Osteogenesis imperfecta ( even if Type1) should know better than running down steps in slippery shoes with a glass (!) walking stick - for goodness sake. Some reviewers have marveled at the build up of tension. I'm astonished at how I managed to stick around with my eyes open. Dragging through syrup with millstones on both feet is more descriptive. I just hoped against hope that some twist would save this film. People have expressed satisfaction with the ending. For me the ending was the last straw. It was so crying out loud bad as to verge on spoof.",Unbreakable
407,Kane20,Review - Unbreakable,8,9 July 2012,"A year after the hit success of The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan re-casts Bruce Willis and re-applies his unique film formula for Unbreakable. He succeeds in providing a second demonstration of the very unique suspenseful and emotional dramatic mystery thrillers he had become known for. He sets an excellent balance between supernaturality and the real world while also focusing heavily on character and family dynamics. In several ways, besides the casting of Bruce Willis, the film is very similar to The Sixth Sense – for example, the plot follows a very similar formula with similar types of plot points, and both movies take place in Philadelphia. But the formula is applied to a different genre. Also, Bruce Willis is not the only star. He is starring along with Samuel L. Jackson, whom he also starred with in Die Hard 3.Bruce Willis is now bald, and his character, David Dunn, a stadium security guard, is not a walking dead person, like Malcolm Crowe in Sixth Sense. David is very much alive, even following a lethal train wreck at the inciting incident near the beginning, in which all the passengers die except for him. What's more, he was completely unbroken not a single scratch, let alone any injuries. Soon after, he finds a note on his windshield asking him a question which really starts him thinking about his seemingly lucky survival, especially after he meets the writer of the note, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson).Elijah is a gallery owner who loves, and finds importance in, comic books, especially those about superheroes. He even finds connections between comic book stories and real life, and is a firm believer in it. All his life, Elijah has had a disorder in which his bones are extremely weak, easily breakable, for which he was called ""Mr. Glass"" by other kids while growing up. He wonders that if he is at one end of the spectrum, where his bones break easily, couldn't there be somebody at the other end of the spectrum, who never gets sick, never gets hurt, is practically unbreakable? This is why he seeks out David, and finally meets him about half an hour into the film, after learning the details of his survival from the train wreck. After this, the story begins to pick up speed and venture more into the concept of the film: superheroes, comic books, and possible unbreakablilty (David). The movie does contain a few elements from comic book stories (but not in written boxes), all mixed with Shyamalan's formula, reality, suspense, and other elements. It's a cool story.I have to say, I kind of like M. Night Shyamalan's type of films. I don't really love any of his films, but they are worth watching, especially Signs. He has a very unique way of storytelling, and he provides the correct type balance between character, emotion, suspense, reality, supernaturality, and all other aspects. He knows what mysteries to answer or to leave hanging. He knows how to make something or some event believable even though it would never happen in real life (en example in Unbreakable is when David's son, Josepsh, has his father's gun and wants to shoot him – which he doesn't – to prove that he is unbreakable). He knows the best time to reveal little bits of important information, adding to the suspense, and he is great at placing important plot points and symbolic things within seemingly everyday appearance, dialogue, and description.The concept, which is prying into reality, is not always or totally noticed believed amongst the characters and their families, but it is evident, and it really reflects in their emotions and behaviors. And resolutions are also strong and clearly reflected and evident emotionally in character and family dynamics. Shyamalan is an expert at this. And his formula can probably be used for almost any subject matter, even things in plain real life. I know he's gone downhill lately, especially with Airbender, but he has been successful in the past, and I'm betting he's still got potential now. I think he should really use his potential and get back up to where he was, and that people should stop pounding and avoiding him and just give him a chance, and acknowledgment for his four best films (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village).",Unbreakable
408,dav7nine,Great,8,25 February 2005,"I think this film is great. I would go as far as to say even a masterpiece! Story centres around Bruce Willis, a normal guy who turns out to have an enhanced sense of perception in judging evil people, who have done wrong. I seen the trailers for this film and thought 'woah! I need to see this.....' I went to the pictures and was not disappointed at all.I don't know M Night Shyamalan's history, but this is one seriously talented guy. Take any of his films... they're all great...I would scoff at anyone who watches this and says it's guff! 8/10 for me! Dave",Unbreakable
409,shalabodov-32997,One of the best representatives of a superhero movie,10,1 July 2018,"I saw this movie fairly recently and I was absolutely blown away. Everything about this film is brilliant, starting with acting and ending with direction. As stated previously, this is a superhero movie, and it's as realistic as you could possibly get. Bruce Willis gives the best performance of his entire career and Samuel L. Jackson is at his absolute top. The movie is shot astonishingly well. The extremely long takes make it fascinating to watch and it keeps you pinned to the screen. Also, the references to comic books and to the story itself are very satisfying if you notice them. The two main leads always wear clothes of the same color(Willis - green, Jackson- purple) in order to distinguish their personalities and how different they are. Shyamalan's best film, without a doubt. Definitely worth checking out, doesn't matter if you don't fancy the superhero genre.",Unbreakable
410,JonB-2,Shyamalan's Sophomore Slump,4,26 November 2000,"Concept & Direction: 10; story and execution: 2.  Shyamalan's premise for the film, which is a bit different than what the ads would have you think, is fascinating, and it creates a very compelling, sympathetic and interesting character in Mr. Price (Samuel L. Jackson).  However, plot holes and lapses in logic abound and the premise itself doesn't quite fit the dead-serious rendering here.  The only thing that keeps it afloat is the stylishness of Shyamalan's direction, although I could have used a lot less of his wandering POV cam.As with ""The Sixth Sense,"" this film ends with a twist.  Unfortunately, unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" the twist isn't earned, and it betrays our investment to that point.  On the other hand, I saw the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" coming from a mile away, while I had no clue with ""Unbreakable."" That either means Shyamalan did a better job with it this time around, or that he slapped it in without justifying it.  I think the latter.It's a shame, because the film does deal with a fascinating issue: the inextricable linkage between good and evil, how one defines the other and how one needs the other to exist.  He also does a good job illustrating this theme subtly, without hammering us.  Pay particular attention to the occupations of the train wreck victims as they're read off, and also which characters we tend to see in mirrors or reflections and why.  On that level, the film works.  On a lot of others, it fails.  It isn't worth the full price on a Saturday night.  Maybe a discount matinee, but you'll do perfectly fine waiting to rent the DVD or video.Shyamalan shows great promise both as a director and writer, but it feels like this film was rushed in the wake of his ""write your own ticket"" wave after ""The Sixth Sense."" If he takes his time with the next one, it could be dynamite.  With ""Unbreakable,"" all we get is a wet sparkler.",Unbreakable
411,bfg-5,With a better ending it would actually be good,6,15 January 2001,"I gave this a seven when voting as it was a let down, the film is long, but, it built up the tension well. However, and this is a big however, the end was just a sad fizzle. It needed to be a bang. Samual L Jackson was good and the falling down the stairs scene was truly horrific. i enjoyed Bruce's understated, confused ""hero"" but the son was more than a little overzealous in his role. Yet again in Hollywoods history they found a truly original idea, cast it well, but let the screenwriter drop the ball. Like I said seven out of ten, and that is being kind.",Unbreakable
412,Imaculata,Perfect in what it sets out to do. Could not have been improved on.,10,3 May 2016,"I rate this movie a solid 10, and I feel that whenever you rate any movie a 10, it deserves a very good explanation. I don't rate movies based on what I think of other movies in that genre. Nor do I compare movies to other movies made by the same director. So, while I could compare this to The Sixth Sense, and say that I like The Sixth Sense better... How is that a good reason for a lower rating? Does that mean this movie deserves a lower score? I believe movies should be judged on their own, as stand alone products. And as a film, this movie is perfect in what it sets out to accomplish.The movie simply has a fantastic cinematography. Every shot seems thoroughly planned out, and shot as if shooting a frame from a comic book. There are fantastic long shots in this movie, that are not just thrown in as a gimmick, but with a deliberate purpose. Some shots simply hold on a specific perspective. Too few movies seem to understand this classic style. Modern movies constantly cut. Cut, cut cut... -and this is ruining movies. Just hold a shot for a few seconds! Have some patience for crying out loud! And that's what this movie does. It takes its time, and it demands some patience from its audience. You don't need to constantly cut to new camera angles, when you can simply move the camera. And the soundtrack is the final ingredient that makes it all work. It is heroic at times, and also tender and romantic when it needs to. It is in my opinion one of James Newton Howard's best scores.No, this is not an action movie. It is a slow drama. It is a story that needs to be told slowly. Some may regard this as a flaw. I argue that this movie would not be improved upon by making it faster. It is that slow building atmosphere that makes the movie so good. It is well acted, and it is one of the few movies in which I find Samuel L Jackson totally believable as a character who is not shouting profanities all the time. In fact, this may be one of his best acting roles. Bruce Willis is also fantastic in this. I also feel that not a single line of dialogue is off, or out of place.Some have called the plot twist predictable. Well, I've seen plenty of people be caught off guard by the twist, myself included, so I see nothing wrong with it. But while the twist is a good way to bookend the movie, I think where the movie really shines is simply the fact that it as a lot of heart. It is sentimental, it is romantic, and it romanticizes the idea of the real life superhero. That is what it is all about, and if you can't embrace that concept, then this movie is simply not for you. There are scenes in this movie that still get the waterworks running, and get me crying man-tears. Call me sentimental, but the movie works for me. Maybe because it touches on a topic that is dear to my heart: The idea of the real life hero.",Unbreakable

415,Calios,"Good vs. Evil, but you couldn't tell.",9,6 December 2000,"Samuel L. Jackson has done a lot of movies and in them he has been at least fair to fairly good. With this movie he now ranks as my favorite and most admired black actor and I can't wait to see what he does with his character (he surely must get dusted, by an older Ankin or would it be Vader) in the upcoming Star Wars movie. He plays this guy in ""Unbreakable"" like a fine magician and at the end of the trick you slap your head and wonder how he he did it. He deserves an Oscar!Bruce Willis does his usual, working hard to convey his character's personality and is quite good. It could be due to David Dunn's lack of personality or for that matter wisdom that people mistake for Bruce Willis poor acting.The story is much different from ""Sixth Sense"", but done brilliantly as well. Don't get into the traps of thinking this is another ""Sixth Sense"" or that we are dealing with just comic book characters.

416,Jisk,M. Night is ahead of his time,8,13 December 2000,"M. Night is already one of the most important directors in AmericanCinema history. He is well on his way to being a master of hiscraft, and with 'Unbreakable' he proves how far he is willing to goto believe in his vision, even if many perceive this film to be ""off"" ornot that great. I think this is an unusual film, a special film, and arare film. It is beautiful, dense, deliberate, articulate, and haunting.
The bad buzz I have been hearing kind of reminds me of the buzzthat 'Vertigo' receieved when it first came out. ""What the @!#%& isthis? "" many said and balked at Hitchcock's masterpiece. That filmis now one of his most revered works, and one of his moststudied. I believe the future holds well for 'Unbreakable'.

418,ahsawesa,An Important Film For The Superhero Genre,8,18 January 2019,"Why am I reviewing a 19 year old film? Because it's one of my all time favorites and because I believe it stands out as something special among all the comic book and superhero films out thereUnbreakable is a meta take (as in self aware) on comic book genre that was way ahead of it's time. I saw it for the first time maybe 6 years ago. Over the years as my knowledge of film and storytelling expanded, Unbreakable became special to me because it's a superhero story told in one of the most unique ways I've ever seen. We don't have big CGI monsters battling it out with a big beam in the sky in the background.It's a slow burn drama of a super hero on a journey of self discovery. M. Night presents a question and then takes his characters on a journey where they figure out the answers to those questions. The question here is that is David Dunn, the protagonist who is the only survivor of a train wreck, a real life superhero?And as Elijah, a crippled supporting character who has a rare condition that causes his bones to break easily and who has spent most of his life in hospital doing nothing but reading comics, presents these questions to David, we the audience also go on a journey with David as M. Night continually builds on the major question that is being asked here. Whether David has ever been injured, if David has a weakness like superheroes do and so on. The whole film is a back and forth between the beliefs of David and Elijah as they have totally opposite beliefs about this possibility.Unbreakable is not only a drama but it's a puzzle that's why you can also classify it as a mystery thriller because whether David is a superhero or not is a mystery and figuring out the truth and lengths characters go to to figure it out is the real thrill of the film here.Another thing that makes Unbreakable so special is it's grounded nature. Rarely do you see a superhero film that is so close to reality and that adds a lot of weight to the story because there's this sense of awe and wonder from both the audience and the characters when M Night begins to play the possibility of David being a real life superhero.The cinematography in this is some of the best I've ever seen in a superhero film. It pays homage to wide frames and panels of comic books as most scenes take place in a single take and that is just remarkable because they're all done seamlessly. There are also only a handful amount of cuts as in most scenes, instead of cutting to another shot, M Night pans back or across the frame to reveal certain things. The cinematography plays a huge part in telling this story because even though M. Night uses a lot of vivid colors and foreshadowing, he follows the rule of show don't tell as much as possible which is exactly what film making is about - show don't tell.The score in this film? My god, one of the most moving scores I've ever heard. I can't praise James Newton Howard enough for making this masterpiece. It evokes a sense of grandness that is needed to accompany the seriousness of the story because the questions the film is asking is indeed very serious - are there real life superheroes among us?Even though this film is old, I feel like I'd be doing it a disservice by spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it but there are certain things I'd like to say without spoiling the third act.Ultimately, Unbreakable is about purpose, discovering our purpose and at times, how far we're willing to go to prove that purpose is indeed real and not fabricated to make ourselves feel important. So in a way it's about desperation too. It's also about emotional damage and how sometimes certain events in our life can shape us into something and lead us to believe something that may not be true. Those who have seen the film and have spent time thinking about it will understand exactly what I'm saying here. The emotional punch of the last 10 minutes of this film is so immense that it makes me tear up sometimes because of the subtext behind THAT ending.My final rating is 8.0/10. It is one of the most important superhero films ever made and if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and see it!",Unbreakable
419,Geoff-21,"Soooo slow, but intriguing",7,7 December 2000,"I'm mixed about this movie. First of all, the tempo of the film is very slow and Bruce Willis acts through the whole film like he's hungover or something. On the flipside, Samuel Jackson was good as always, and the direction was very cool.  I liked how shots were framed in mirrors, reflections in glass, between train seats, etc. That stuff was cool to watch. And speaking of watch, I looked at mine a lot during this movie. It took until the ""orange suit man"" scene to wake myself up. By then, the movie had 15 minutes left out of 2+ hours! And I guessed the ending, too (bummer, since Sixth Sense floored me). So, all in all, I gave it a 6 just for the direction and basic concept alone.  Just be prepared to wait over an hour for everything to come together.",Unbreakable
420,Hypotheses,So Much for the Hype,7,19 November 2001,"Unbreakable  7/10<11/27/00> I expected to rate Bounce and Unbreakable just the opposite of how I actually ended up rating them. I thought that Bounce would be this straight ""chick flick"", which it was, but amazingly enough it still turned out to be decently entertaining. With Unbreakable, my expectations were way too high. The trailers, which showed the audience virtually nothing, had me eagerly anticipating something dark and mysterious, but what I got instead was slightly less than adequate schlock. I am not saying that Unbreakable was horrible; in fact, it was far from it and I would see it again. It's clearly a movie for comic book lovers, which I am, BTW, but that doesn't negate basic film analysis. It just wasn't invigorating when it clearly needed to be, had a lack of basic momentum, was too concerned with odd camera angles, wasn't very thought-provoking, and concluded with yet another cheap, gimmicky ending a la The Sixth Sense that doesn't work. That said, I still liked the film. It was brooding and dark, Twilight Zone like. Too bad general audiences will probably bad-mouth it to their friends for certain.
Still, worth a repeat viewing. 7/10",Unbreakable

Amazingly well paced, intelligently written and an original take on a genre that rarely is given much thought... superheroes! A much better film than the above average yet overated Sixth Sense,  M. Night Shyamalan outdid himself by making Bruce Willis a serious element as opposed to the stereotypical wise cracking oaf he usually plays in every film. Willis was actually ACTING! Sam Jackson was also excellent here, proving once again he is more than up for the task if the right movie comes along  and was extremely effective in his side of the yin yang equation. Of course the film takes itself very serious, but why shouldnt it? Far too many films now rely on jokes, cliche archetypes and overdone commercialization so its refreshing to see a film that was based on solid storytelling for those who actually had the aptitude to follow it. It does go a bit too artsy in some scenes (though not as overdone as in the american adaptation of ""Ring""), but even so Shy pulls it off without making a mockery of its dignity. Overall a magnificent film, too bad many of the people who see it just either dont understand it or lack the ability to...",Unbreakable

They said this was a poor follow up to 6th Sense. Due to a high gullibility level I delayed seeing this movie that I had been highly anticipating for some time. Wouldn't you know, they got me again? This is why I think the professionals were ho-hum about Unbreakable. They didn't like being fooled by Shyamalan's first movie! Oh, they got a kick out of it like the rest of us, but every one of them was secretly upset and ashamed that they were fooled JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. Just like the common folk. The rabble who dare to think the main purpose of a movie is to entertain. ""Certainly, I'm better than the homespun yokels,"" they collectively sighed. They couldn't wait for an opportunity to stick it to the guy on round two. So, they did. The fact is, this movie is very good. Very creative. Very likeable characters.

424,jennifer-99,This was a tough one...,8,25 January 2001,"Unbreakable was a rare breed of movie.  After viewing this film, I walked out of the theatre and had absolutely no idea what I thought of it.  I didn't LOVE it, I didn't HATE it.  So I waited for several weeks, carefully forming an opinion, before I decided to comment on it.
If you take this film on its own merits, it is a very good film.  If you compare it to its predecessor, The Sixth Sense, it comes up short.  The characters and story line in Sixth Sense were far more rich and developed than what we see here in Shyamalan's latest effort. While the ending of the Sixth Sense completely made the entire film, and totally blew me out of the theatre, I saw the ending of Unbreakable coming from a mile away.  It tried TOO hard to be shocking and it didn't do the film justice. 
The rest of the movie, however, was beautifully filmed and had a very powerful underlying message.  The most moving scenes are when Willis' character realizes who he is, what his powers are and what his role in society is meant to be.  This is a very ""character driven"" movie.  For those movie watchers who thrive on eye candy and action sequences, you will be sadly disappointed.  For those movie watchers who balk at the idea of a plot that could not possibly happen in real life, you too should avoid this film. This movie requires you to suspend disbelief and immerse yourself entirely in a fantasy world where the impossible is possible.  That being said, the film is worthy of a viewing.  It leaves you with something to think about and may give you a new outlook on the concept of a real life ""hero"".  I'm still not 100 percent sure what I thought of this movie, but I am 99 percent sure that I thought highly enough of it to comment favourably and give it a recommendation.  A unique addition to Shyamalan's resume.",Unbreakable

Thw last time Manoj unleashed ""The Sixth Sense"", he unleashed Storm and this time he has prove that ""sixth sense"" is is possessed only by the ""Unbreakable""s.When I heard the title ""Unbreakable"" for the first time I knew it would be the next blockbluster in the making with a 'sixth sense' of itself and not just run-of-the-mill type of movies and for once I was proved right. This movie is nothing but a genuine Masterpiece.No other movie could be as SIMPLE and yet as INTRIGUING or as COMMON SENSIBLE or more LOGICAL than this one.The moment you finish Watching this movie or even reach haif the length of the movie, you start thinking,""Why the Hell didn't I realize this concept before which so close to my life?"" The script is what you can say simply Brilliant and Intelligent and force you to think in an altogether new dimension about a field which no one ever thought of before.Now... have you ever thought for a moment why some individual in your life is lucky enough to taste success in every field he/she ventures and that too without much efforts while you are stil struggling in only field without much success even though you have worked hard and possess the determination to more? Why were you left so far behind? Does that particular individual possess some kind of superpower which protects him from harm and failure? So now what happens next is that the person becomes the CEO of the same firm you are working for and has an oh-so-sexy girlfriend of his while you still the GM of the firm with no ...that's enough.(Even though you both started at the same level,with the same pay with the same hardwork.) What went wrong and WHERE? You feel as if a negative energy just like a black hole is sucking you inside itself.(Remember the movie we are talking about is NOT a supernatural movie.)If you now start to observe your life and his ,you will atart to visualise a superhero like a Batman/Superman in him and in yourself you will find ... that's enough. Similar kinds of questions haunt our very own Batman(Bruce Willis)and the Two-Face(Samuel L. Jackson)in this larger-AS-life movie. Meanwhile, the CEO too thinks the reason for not firing him of his CEO's post even though he made a particular major mistake in selling the shares of his firm to a wrong firm.Why the hell did they choose him ""The Business Man of the year"" inspite of the fact that the other person deserved it because of his better Business tactics? The movie starts with a blast(a real as well as mental)where Bruce's character escapes literally unscratched out of a major train accident carrying 142 passengers(I tnink it was 142 though I may not be correct)out which 140 die on the spot and 1 dies in the hospital.The only one survivor is Bruce uninjured. Meanwhile, here Samuel's character is suffering from oesteogenesis imperfecta (a bone disorder)which makes brittle enough to break even if a passerby pushes him to pass by ion the footpath. Ther are more secrets and more accidents in both of their lives which revealsomething extraordinary as the movie reveals itself.But there's something more to it than what'svisible to our naked eyes.A DARK SECRET...(To know the secret watch the movie.) Anyway the direction of the movie is outstanding so is the acting from these two renowned actors for an outstanding script. But what Iloved the most is the unexpected climax (No I won't reveal it and spoil the fun for you. Instead wstch the start of the movie, the end and the middle too.)(I don't understand why some people think this movie to be a comic-strip or a comic-book based movie.Instead I would request them to watch this movie carefully again so as to understand its concept.) This movie is one of myTop25 FAvourite Movies of All Time alongside Crimson Tide,Life is Beautiful,The Sixth Sense, Terminator 2:Judgement Day,Taxi Driver,Raging Bull,Dog Day Afternoon and many more. I hope Shyamalan's next project ""Signs"" based on Philadelphia crop circles mystery(if what i have read about is correct.) is as excellent as this one.My Personal Conclusion:'Unbreakable'is one step ahead of 'The sixth Sense'.",Unbreakable

And STILL if you want to watch a superhero movie, there are two options for you :(1)Batman forever(1995) which is the best of all the superhero movies you name it(Superman,Spiderman,even other Batman movies)because it packs some solid emotional stuff too.(2)True Lies(1994)which is better than all the other senseless secret agent movies you want to compare ""True Lies"" with.This other start at NOTHING ,end at NOTHING and you learn NOTHING from them. Except for some exotic locations to watch out for.""True Lies"" is definitely a Classic Action Movie based which can be based on comic book.And on the other hand if your looking for some Masterpieces I would like to present a list of my Personal Top 30 movies of All Time for you which I hope every movie fan or otherwise should watch atleast once in Lifetime : Great Dictator,The(1940); M*A*S*H(1970); Godfather,The(1972); Godfather:2,The(1974); Dog Day Afternoon(1975); Taxi Driver(1976); Kramer Vs.

I also knew that it had gotten a high grade on IMDb but I was bitterly disappointed.The second scene in the movie where Bruce Willis is riding on the train the camera eerily peeks from behind one chair to Willis, or to his co-passanger. This scene is tense like the Sixth Sense was.But, unlike Sixth Sense there is no threat or doom lurking within this movie. It just goes on and on while Willis is refusing to accept his destiny.  Scenes are overlong, the dialogue becomes pretentious and all the fun and excitement quickly disappears.***SPOILER ALERT/ DON'T READ ON UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE***The final ending makes the character of Samuel L.

Though Samuel L. Jackson comes across more wooden than I've ever seen him, overall the acting is excellent. The problem seems to be the implausible script: why spend so much energy developing 'Elijah' as a wounded prophet/healer only to hang capital 'V' ""Villain"" on him at the last second?

431,ColemanDerrick,As important as Phillip Wylie's Gladiator,9,27 December 2001,"As I mention above, this film falls in line with the precostume stories, the main one being Gladiator, the book which inspired Siegel and Shuster to create Superman.  I hope not to give too much away, but the villain of the film is very much the mastermind of Lex Luthor, Dr. Sivana, and most importantly, the original Ultra-Humanite. The hero of the film is based on several DC characters, among them: *Superman, quite naturally, as his physical prowess stands above all others *Green Lantern, the original one, who was the sole survivor of a train wreck, and who was based in another East Coast city before moving to Gotham City(as the hero of Unbreakable is attempting to find a job in New York City) *The look of the ""costumed hero"" resembles the appearance of The Spectre, whose facial features are hidden under a green hood and cloak.  Much like the Spectre, Mr. Unbreakable is an astral avenger of sorts, saving people and exacting just vengeance *The very mention of New York City, which is home to so many of the most famous superheroes, and serves as inspiration to Metropolis, Gotham City, Empire City, and so many other doppelgangers of The Big Apple, as cities themselves are living entities of sorts  I really enjoyed this movie, and I will suggest that anyone who likes comics will be presently surprised.

But after that, many people write all of his other movies off because they've heard they're terrible. And most of them are. But this one is extremely underrated. It may not be Shakespeare, but it's quality entertainment nonetheless. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are fantastic in their roles and they carry the story very well. It's a little slow in parts, but for the most part it is extremely entertaining and keeps you engaged the whole way through. The ending (though I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it) gives me chills every time I see it. It is an inventive concept with twists and turns throughout. So if you think that Shamylan didn't do anything good after the sixth sense, if you're judging his talent by the village and lady in the water, give this movie a try. It's a great psychological thriller that assures us that Shamylan was not a one-hit wonder. Although I wouldn't argue with you if you said these two were the only ones worth watching.",Unbreakable

Unbreakable on the other hand was interesting throughout with a somewhat disappointing ending. I liked the story and all of the performances, but the movie seemed to be a ruined cause once the disappointing ""surprise"" ending was revealed. I heard this weekend that Unbreakable may be the first in a series of movies based on these characters (I actually heard Willis said this was the first of a trilogy); if this is the case Unbreakable will become better as part of a larger story.Still, despite what I saw as a disappointing ending, I liked the movie as a whole and will like it better if it does turn out to be just a first installment of a larger story.(8/10)",Unbreakable

There is an oppressive unrelenting aura of absolute despair which permeates all of the characters in the movie, and nothing is quite able to dispel it. I understand that the director was trying to create a mood here, but really, it was excessive. Even at moments when Bruce Willis should be really happy (like when he survives a train wreck without a scratch on him) he still looks like his puppy just died. In fact, Willis' character is so subdued, so broody, that for about the first twenty minutes of the movie, I honestly thought he was supposed to be autistic or something. Samuel Jackson is the only character who comes close to emoting anything other than pure despair, and you can just tell the director was holding him back. As it was played, the few comic moments of the film didn't even appear comic.Added to this, all the actors, but Bruce Willis in particular, whisper all their lines. Again, yes, I know, its not an action movie, the hero doesn't neccessarily have to spend his time shouting lines like ""Yippee-kay-ay mother-f***er,"" but this was absurd. I get it, these people are upset, people who are depressed don't shout, but this is ridiculous. Willis barely raised his voice above a whisper. Again, while it might have made parts of the movie more tense, it totally ruined any scenes in which any joy was present.Despite the fact that the plot of the movie was extremely similar to ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was a very interesting idea. However, the director, in trying to so artfully display the angst of his characters, really did not do the plot justice.",Unbreakable
437,Tyler-Durden,Extremely disappointing.,4,12 February 2001,"After all the success ""The Sixth Sense"" got, director M. Night Shyamalan's started to make another film, also written and directed by himself, just like his fantastic previous film, and just to make things better, the film even had Bruce Willis in it's cast.Just like in sequels, people always expect something bigger and better. Since most people really enjoyed The Sixth Sense, now they were positive about Unbreakable: ""It'll be the best of the year 2000!"". Well, I was one of those poor people who thought that, and I was amazingly disappointed.The movie is unbelievably bad, and I'm not exaggerating here. Although the performances by Willis and Jackson were good, the script is just too poor. The subject isn't that bad, about the 'unbreakable' man and all; If it would have been written in a different story, it could have been good.The way this movie develops the story of the 'unbreakable' man and the 'easily breakable' one and how he finds out about his powers and what he can do with them is good. Yes, it's thrilling. The only (but huge) problem is that the whole movie you expect something to happen, and nothing actually happens. You don't necessarily need to expect a twist at the end, like the one in ""The Sixth Sense"", but you were waiting to see something actually happening. And what happens? Nothing. Willis rescues a family, in a short scene where he kills a guy, and then nothing. Yes, nothing. Then he goes to Samuel L. Jackson's party, and there Elijah (Jackson) confesses that he killed about 500 people just to find the 'unbreakable' man, and he did. And what's next? Again, nothing. The movie ends.Through the movie you can also see several dialogues about Jackson's comic books, and they are totally pointless, so, then again, when you ask yourself ""What was it with the comic books?"", you can use the word Nothing.The movie has the same atmosphere as ""The Sixth Sense"", and kind of the same style, you can clearly notice it's the same director.

I might think about these elements in retrospect or on repeat viewings, but I feel for the most part that it's a movie's job to draw me into the story and make me forget about the technical stuff.  With ""Unbreakable,"" I found myself being much more entertained by the technical stuff than I was by the story -- much as I felt as I watched Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut.""The cinematography is brilliant in this movie.  Every shot feels storyboarded and very carefully planned, which is not a bad thing if it's in support of a strong story and script.  I found the writing to be thin -- like a short story dragged out to the point that it feels way too slow. Also, the evocative music seemed to signify something greater than what I was seeing.Bruce Willis seems drugged and kind of stupid here.  He was muted in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but still seemed intelligent and full of emotion. Robin Wright Penn has a couple of nice scenes and gets to show some depth of emotion. Samuel L. Jackson is always interesting and adds some nice touches to an underwritten character.There's no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a major talent with decades of strong filmmaking ahead of him.

The talk about heroes and comic books was ludicrous and infantile at best. Willis had some good moments but the depression thing is not suitable for him, he was lifeless and zombielike and both he and his wife appeared to suffer from a Major Depression while the son apparently freaked out and showed also some alarming psychiatric symptoms.

In my opinion, it's much better than The Sixth Sense (a film on IMDB's top 250).  Everything about the film could be of good use for studying in writing and film classes.You have David Dunn, a character who perfectly fits the superhero mold.  He is an average Joe and seems to be a bit of uncomfortable in his oversized suit in the opening scene.  In a typical superhero origin story, he knows not that he is special.  So even after he is the sole survivor of a massive train wreck, he doesn't know what to make of it until along comes Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), a comic book connoisseur who thinks-but is not sure-that David may be one of the people that his comic books are written about.Elijah is a main character himself as he is the opposite of David from the very beginning of the film.  He is a man who is quite breakable, unlike the never-been-sick David.  How far different the two characters are is not revealed until the end.  Between then and the beginning is a good look at a superhero's life: trying to patch up a broken marriage, raise a son, discovering the limits of his ""powers,"" and analyze the relationships of characters in comics.Even more intricate than the plot is the magnificent camera work, cinematography, direction, and sound.  The framing of most of the shots in the film is a great take on the comic book theme, which themselves are frames within a page.  So in shots you will have a banister, a doorframe, train seats, etc. framing up the shot.  It's done to a noticeable extent. The shot lengths themselves are long and show how well the actors play their parts since some shots are over a minute long like in a Kubrick production. Also of note is how-as Elijah comments on-the ""villains"" in David's telepathic-like visions stand out in a crowd.  In the crowded scenes, there is very little color by 99% of those around.  But those who rub against David that wear a colored type of clothing cause flashes of their crimes to appear in his head.  When we get a better shot of the perp later, they definitely look like they stand out.  There is the guy in the vivid camouflage jacket, the drug dealer in the deep blue windbreaker (played by M. Night himself), the jewel thief in the bright red dress, the frat boy who takes advantage of a drunken girl in the neon green shirt, etc (and that etc. includes one other surprise character).  And the score... the score was magnificent!  It was quite eerie in parts.  The sound complimented it quite well.  That was eerier in parts as well, especially if you check the bonus materials of the DVD and see the deleted carnival scene as a younger Elijah breaks his arm on a ride.  The sound makes you wince in pain with the kid!I gave the film 10 and wonder why it is not in the IMDB top 250 where it belongs.  It was the best film of 2000 (not that overrated Traffic).",Unbreakable
444,nixar55,Underappreciated *major spoilers*,9,3 May 2004,"I can't see why people had such a hard time with this movie. Maybe people were expecting the thrills and chills of The Sixth Sense. This a muted film, dripping with quiet moments and an overall feeling of sadness. Yes, there were a few scenes I would've cut given the chance (Dunn's son and the gun, especially,) but mostly, this is a simple movie with a theme that is both simple and thought-provoking. It's about comic books, archetypes, and modern myths. It's a superhero origin story that doesn't go for something flashy. Yes, if you were expecting the color and spectacle of Superman/Spider-man/Batman, etc., you'd be really disappointed. This is about a regular guy played perfectly by Bruce Willis discovering that he has super-strength. You see Dunn go from an average man to a hero, a mysterious, cloaked iconic sketch on the front page of a newspaper. He is living in a world of comic book figures that are still familiar in the real world. He discovers a mentor of sorts in Elijah, the comic store owner who suffers from a rare disease. The ""twist"" that this director loves to put in his movies really shocked me.
""Unbreakable"" is the origin story of a villain, too. The total opposite of Dunn's superman. I loved Jackson's line ""Now that we know who you are, I know who I am."" Of course Elijah is the villain - he's lonely, he's disfigured, he's an outcast, and he has crazy ideas. But the lines between his genius and insanity are very, very blurry until the last few minutes. I felt a huge amount of sympathy for this character, until Elijah shared his criminal secrets. He is the total opposite of Dunn, not just physically, but morally as well. The little coda at the end was perfect, too, with Elijah going to ""an asylum for the criminally insane."" He goes to Arkham! If this movie were a comic book, naturally, Elijah would escape to cause more mayhem, like all great evil geniuses.This is a wonderful movie for comic book fans, people who enjoy the myths of superheroes, and enjoy seeing those same formulas twisted around in an interesting way. I liked this movie almost as much as ""The Sixth Sense"" (that movie felt a bit better-paced) and a lot more than ""Signs"" (that movie felt forced to me.)",Unbreakable

These are 2 views I had on Unbreakable. An engaging beginning attracted me, so I expected a good- class film. To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed, because there are too many „unexpected“ American accidents. Besides this, theories that comic- books are a form of history are maybe original, but for me they were strange and weird. It is too unbelievable for the age we live in. Unbreakable was sometimes too lengthy, in my opinion it needs more action. A big plus is the camera, which's shots are very uncommon; the soundtrack is also nice.",Unbreakable

I hope you can keep an open mind.",8,19 February 2013,"Directed by M.Night ShyamalanStarring Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson and Robin WrightWritten by M.Night ShyamalanUnbreakable is 'A suspense thriller with supernatural overtones that revolves around a man who learns something extraordinary about himself after a devastating accident.'I wasn't sure what to expect with this film. I knew the plot, I knew the actors but it was the Director that confused me the most. What kind of a superhero film will Shyamalan bring to the screen? Let me just say, it was fantastic!M.Night Shyamalan's efforts were great! His work is nothing short of spectacular. He appears to have his own voice when telling a story through film and it's fantastic. His vision was outstanding and the film's tone couldn't have been more 'down to earth'. The Cinematography was the aspect that hit me the most. The camera angles, focusing and movements reminded me so much of a comic book. An example is when Samuel L Jackson's character receives his first comic book from his mother. The camera work in that scene was incredible and comical. It is something you have to see for yourself.The cast wasn't anything special besides Samuel L Jackson's performance. Jackson has proved to me time and time again that he can play any character he chooses. I bought everything he was saying. The character he portrays is so unique and interesting. As a comic book lover, you see his determination to solve Bruce Willis' character's dilemma. Bruce Willis' efforts on the other hand didn't attract me in any way. I didn't see anything different or out of the box with his performance but I believe that was the point. He was ordinary. Just like every comic book hero's alter ego. His character is an everyday Joe and that is where Bruce Willis' performance thrives.The Score helped in the Thriller aspect of this picture. Since this is a M.Night Shyamalan film, you know there is always going to be some 'out of the ordinary' twist and the music creates that emotion through the film. It's brilliant.Unbreakable is a fantastic film but I have read some hate towards it. If you are looking for an 'Avengers' or 'Amazing Spider-man' flick then this particular style of story telling isn't for you. But if you admire a super hero film with deep and twisting writing with amazing and unique characters then you will enjoy this film",Unbreakable
448,labeatkryeziu,Nothing happens all movie,1,19 April 2020,I usually never write reviews but i just had to with this one. I dont remember any movie that i have seen that absolutely nothing happens for almost 2 hours. It is just blank and predictable. Bruce personality seems like he has very serious problems that he needs to adress. I really really really want to know how people enjoyed this movie :/,Unbreakable
449,Shrykespeare,M. Night's best (contains spoilers),10,26 July 2004,"""Unbreakable"" is one of those films that garners extreme reactions on both ends of the spectrum; either people love it or hate it.The biggest criticism is that the movie is too long and too slow to develop, which is certainly a understandable argument.  I prefer to look at M. Night's films in a different light; I admire the way that he absolutely refuses to rush through a story, and the way that he lets the characters develop at their own pace.  Bruce Willis's slow, gradual transformation is a beautiful thing to watch, a testament to Bruce's incredible talent.  The aura of sadness that he projects through most of the movie is tangible, and it's only through the teachings (or manipulation, if you will) of Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah, that Bruce's character, David, is able to finally realize his full potential, to understand his place in the world, and to connect with his son in a way he never could before.I would also like to give special kudos to Spencer Clark's performance as David's son, Joseph.  Most kids, especially those not close to their parents, have no understanding of what their parents do for a living.  It's more comfortable to live a fantasy, where your Dad is a superhero and you will one day follow in his footsteps.  It's no wonder that when the possibility presents itself that David is special, Joseph latches onto that notion, and proceeds to stop at nothing to prove it to his father, even coming a hair's-breadth from shooting him.David's first adventure as a superhero was magnificently done.  He walks into a train station, bustling with people, and lets his instincts take over.  Just by touching people, he can see what terrible things they've done (kind of like John Smith on USA's ""The Dead Zone"", but not as extreme), for example, shoplifting, race violence, and date rape.  But when he brushes up against a man who had committed cold-blooded murder, David leaps into action.  He follows the man to a house he has taken over - both parents are dead, but the two children are still alive.  The confrontation is also very well done.  No words are spoken; there is no flurry of blows or martial arts moves; simply one man taking another man down in a way that any of us might do in similar circumstances.The next morning, David shows his son a newspaper detailing the incident. He silently mouths the words ""You were right"", and his son sheds a tear of joy; his fantasy has been fulfilled, and his connection to his father can only get stronger from here on out.  They also agree to keep his double life secret from David's wife, which is another nice touch.Given Elijah's life and state of mind, it is very reasonable to understand his motives for wanting to find someone like David.  That he used such reprehensible methods for doing so makes the ending that much more shocking.Most people, especially moviegoers, are easily bored.  They are addicted to the quick fix, where something dramatic or exciting has to happen every five minutes or they lose interest.  That is why ""Unbreakable"" has elicited such negative praise from some critics.  But I am of the opinion that if the view at the top is spectacular enough, it's doesn't matter how long it takes to get up the mountain.My score: 10.",Unbreakable

451,Percivalx,Breaking Into Pieces,4,24 March 2007,"Unbreakable is a slow moving film with a twist ending that doesn't quite work. But my major problem with the film was with the villain, Elijah. He wants to find David, the guy on the other side of the spectrum and simply tell him he's super human. But Elijah's motives are never made clear. We never really learn what is his goal in seeking out David. In the end, all he does is tell David to go to a crowded train station and have some kind of psychic experience. When you stop and think about it, there's nothing in it for Elijah! Because the villain's plan makes no sense, the entire film makes no sense. On top of that, David has a decent job. He helps people for a living as a security guard. Plus, he's having marital problems. There is no logical reason for him to compound his problems by following orders from some lunatic who's been stalking him and his family. This makes the film unsatisfying - it's a big build up... to nothing. The whole comic book concept is potentially interesting but the movie's attempt at it is disappointingly flawed.

I also wanted to watch the approach of M. Night Shyamalan to a superhero movie and what a pleasant surprise.It's a movie that took me inside the thoughts and feelings of the hero and the villain, and it does it so slightly that there is no need for complex dialogues, the background story of the characters is just right, the duality of good and evil is presented in a unique form that delivers in a great way.Yes, It's the usual story of the hero fighting with himself when he discovers that has extraordinary abilities, his inner fight that will lead him into purpose, but it is presented in a way that connects with the viewer in a rare but very nice form.The good ending, the good acting, soundtracks and shooting are just there to complement a very good ride.",Unbreakable

While I wasn't incredibly astonished by ""The Sixth Sense"" the way everyone else was, especially the Academy, I still agree it was an original and well-done film.  Shyamalan has a knack for creating believable characters put in unbelievable, yet plausible, situations.Going into ""Unbreakable"" I expected a supernatural thriller.  While the film was supernatural it was nothing like I expected.  Shyamalan produced, wrote, and directed this completely original work of film art.  I am a huge fan of original work and M. Night certainly delivered.Bruce Willis plays a Temple stadium security guard named David Dunn, a man who was traveling home on a train when it derailed due to a mechanical functions killing every passenger except Dunn, who wasn't harmed at all. Obviously, this has quite an impact on Willis' character who is searching for some type of answer.  Elijah Price, portrayed brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson, is a comic collector in Philadelphia who believes he has the answer to Willis' question.  Read what you want from this little bit I have given you but I can say no more.  It will simply ruin all the fun and brilliance about the first viewing of this film.M. Night has one-upped himself with ""Unbreakable"", a far superior film to his 1999 monster hit ""The Sixth Sense"".  I was quite pleased with this film and it ranks up there with ""Gladiator"" and ""Billy Elliot"" has one of my favorite films so far this year.9.5/10",Unbreakable
455,PJ-52,Beautifully crafted and directed!,8,1 December 2000,"Unfortunately, comparisons have to be made with the debut film from Shyamalan. This is a great follow up but... Plot-wise this isn't quite as intriguing as SENSE. Character-wise the way in which Willis has to come to terms with being who he is, does not compare with the horrors young Haley Joel had to face. In fact the best character in this film is Robin Wright's loyal, enduring wife. Did it need the ""twist"" at the end, or was it merely expected? Both films were beautifully crafted and directed.

His never ending melancholy gets explained as well, what I liked best is Samuel L. Jackson's character's line, he says: ""life can't be contained inside a little square box"" (or something to that effect), and the next few scenes are shot in a very ""comic book style"", with static camera and framing the scenes in ""square boxes"", playful and beautiful!The director gave us plenty of clues to the ending, but we didn't use them, I like that.Never mind the people that hated the ""ending"" it explains everything and definitely closes the picture.I highly recommend it!",Unbreakable

Here is also a movie thats musical score didn't realize it wasn't in the Abyss, and who's director was overly directing. M.Night has done a horrible job of directing. He tries to add an extra thought by retardly putting the camera in the most annoying places. He started to do this in Sixth Sense with that stupid idea about RED. And he also puts himself in his films, when he does it you know it's him trying to be a director. The writing was good, but so Syd Field. I bet M.Night stayed up late every night reading that screenplay book. You can tell that before he wrote anything down he marked pages 30, 60, and 90 for plot points.Also, he had everybody whisper, which was creepy and moody for Sixth Sense, here it comes off goofy and lame. This film had a small idea, and with no imagination it went nowhere. It's obvious that M.Night is influenced by Kubrick, and yes, Unbreakable is a film Kubrick would have made if he had no imagination or talent.Advise to M.Night: ""KNOCK IT OFF!

459,seghers,M. Night Believes his Press,4,27 March 2010,"I loved the Sixth Sense. I had heard this movie had gotten mixed reviews and that some people loved it. Strong premise certainly- a man finds himself indestructible, and there's another man who is at the other extreme, and whose bones break constantly. A man looking for a hero- the reverse of himself. OK. We watched it with an open mind, expecting a decent movie. I have to say, this is the slowest, dullest movie I have seen in a long time. Not only is it dull, but it off the scale in terms of pretentiousness and self-importance. It's one of those movies where, if you think it's dull, then you're just not intelligent or you just ""dont get it."" The actors all seem to sleep through their roles here, like they're waiting for the ending to come, just like we were. Too many artists (in all media) with breakout successes follow it up with a second effort that is overblown and misses the point of what made them successful. Unbreakable is a perfect example. What a pointless mess, with the big M.Night twilight-zone ""TWIST"" at the end... hit me like, OK, yeah, I get it. Nothing NEAR the impact of the twist, and the conclusion, of the Sixth Sense. His next effort, Signs, is an underrated movie that gets better when you see it a second, third time. After that... M. Night's career just spiraled out of control. Most of them are formulaic and borderline-unwatchable. It's as if he is desperate to re-create the magic of his first movie, but clueless how to go about it. If he gets another chance- and anyone with the vision to create an amazing movie like The Sixth Sense should have as many chances as they'll give him- I hope he goes back to what made that movie great. Snappy pacing, great acting, intricate plot that rewards the audience consistently, ending that ties everything together and satisfies while shocking at the same time.",Unbreakable

Jackson, both delivered excellent performances and they're characters were very interesting, specially Jackson's character, Mr. Glass, also, James Newton Howard's score for this film is in my opinion the best work he has ever done, specially the Orange Man cue. The story of this movie is also really good, it tells a very human and realistic story of a man who has powers, this is not your average super hero story, this is in every way very different and very unconventional.

It turns out however that, as a true artist, while retaining the same eerie, slow-paced, subdued style of storytelling, Night Shyamalan's new movie has little in common with the first one, except maybe... well, both are masterpieces.

I was a rabid collector at one point, so I've read many of the the origins of superpowered characters.  The rest of this review contains many major SPOILERS.    Firstly, what I liked about the movie. I really loved the slow, deliberate pacing.  This slow pacing accentuates the problems Willis' character is having accepting his lack of sickness and his seeming invulnerability.  He is groping for an answer to his past, and he wants it to be as ""normal"" as possible.  Willis is often cast in parts (like this) without much dialogue; this is not due to his lack of acting ability, but because his face and eyes are so uniquely, and poignantly, expressive in non-verbal communication. The drama this ""good"" man faces confronting his insecurities is plausible, as he very gradually comes to accept his uniqueness. This is shown very well in the weightlifting scene where his son keeps adding more and more weights to the bar.  I was very satisfied with this side of the story, including his first crime-solving caper. I just didn't care for the Glass Man story.  Jackson's character is so incredibly sympathetic and downright pitiful for 90% of the film that it's very difficult to suddenly accept him as a crazed lunatic in the last couple of scenes.  It would have been better if he knew of some super-villain (through his acute powers of observation) who committed these atrocities, and pointed Willis in that direction.  Also, The childbirth scene at the beginning is horrifying, and creates even more sympathy for the Glass Man character. The final thing that bothered me is the very abrupt ending. I expected another 15 or 30 minutes of story, but the story ends very weakly with words on screen briefly describing what happened to the key characters. All in all, this was a noble experiment of a film.  I liked half of it plus the slow pacing adds to the mystery, but I disliked how the Glass Man story developed and I also hated the ending.

469,wentos,"well done, no ideology, no action superhero movie",8,26 November 2020,"Some say it was ahead of its time. I do not think so. I think that it fits its time perfectly. At least it is not woke as hell as most of today's (yea of the lord 2020) productions. I found the little twists at first annoying but later rewarding when one understands why they were there. Annoying because of sloppy work of most of recent productions where neither reality of our world nor inner reality of the movie have to be in some way consistent with anything or with itself. Here it makes sense but the little ""errors"" that I saw in stories of main evil character were explained in final confrontation.
You still could see the wokeness for instance in the wikipedia article about the movie which I have read after seeing it today. The talk about deconstructing is just bs but that is because the deconstruction from being a method of dealing with problems or projects has become an ideology all by itself.
As for actors - superb acting. All of them show how versatile they are and how well they can act. Director and script writers did their job very well too. I have no clue why additional scenes are left out in streaming version now. For theater release back in the day there surely have been cut to make it fit length that make cinemas happy. Today this does not make sense. But as it is, the movie is still very well made.
There are only two things that I dislike: the deconstructivism which may or not be an ideology but the movie does not show any signs of this being a major or overwhelming motive. Whispering by one of the characters get kind of overused across all the movies Bruce made. But still he is a good actor and the whispering could have been annoying because I dad only German dubbed version where I am now. So this is not his fault maybe.I find it odd that I tend to go back to older movies of late and cannot stand the new productions. Maybe that is a sign of times and sign that I am getting real old. Back when I watched it first time I would have given 7 maybe. Today it gets 8 because of comparison to the crap we are flooded with.

I'm a fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson, but even though they do their best they cannot save this one from mediocricy. First of all it seems to me, that the movie in too many ways is just a repetition of the sixth sense - the same atmosphere, the same music, the same use of camera. The difference is, that the sixth sense was really scary - whereas this one is trying so hard to be scary and shocking, that it simply has to fail. Look at the story - a man find out that he is really a pokémon. And that's all that happens. Worst of all is the ending which is REALLY a drag - why the semi-documental reports of ""what happened afterwards"" ? Is it based on an authentic story ?If not for the actors, and especially Jackson, this one would have been really bad. See the Sixth Sense once again instead.",Unbreakable

After some retrospective thinking, I've decided to give this film a 9. The technical aspects are so well-refined and innovative that it just might make this film one of my favorite movies of all time. Also, talk about an Oscar snub. How did this film not get nominated for ANY Oscars? No Best Cinematography? No Best Editing? No Best Score? No Best Prodcution Design? No Best Supporting Actor for Samuel L. Jackson? No Best Director? Talk about a snub. Overall, I would most definitely recommend this movie.",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan had made a terrible movie (I thought about how good the Sixth Sense was.)But after I had saw it I realized that it was a really good movie, the ending is like the best ending in the whole world! I love that. After that I just could find more and more good parts in that movie, like when Bruce Willis finds out that he is superstrong, and when you find out who the bad guy is!I think this is a fantastic movie! I just needed some time to think about it. Bruce Willis is great as always, but also see how good this young boy Spencer Treat Clark is, I recognize him after gladiator and I think that he is as good as Hale Joel Osment. they both have an amazing  future!",Unbreakable
473,shaquanda36,"Great film, but....",8,15 February 2005,"As an unwavering fan of Mr. M. Night Shayamalan, I must say this was good. But to clarify my perspective, I did not see this when it first came out. I rented it after having seen The Sixth Sense, Signs, and The Village. Being a fan of those three, I knew this would not disappoint.This film has all of the prerequisites of an M. Night film....slow, brooding atmosphere, dialogue instead of action, heaps of character development, and a twist of some kind. Ultimately, this film works. It works well. We feel for the characters, want to know what will happen next, and are intrigued by the premise. All of the actors meet my expectations - there is no weak link in the acting. Shayamalan tends to pull good performances out of everyone.That being said, I think there are two minor problems with this movie. First, the movie has a boldly slow pace, but that works for the film. What bothered me a little bit is there was about a 30 minute period of time in the movie where very little happened - in the ""action"" or in the characters. It seemed a repetitious - ""am I really unbreakable or not? Is this guy yanking my chain or what?"" This problem is minor, but with weaker actors, my attention would not have been held.The other minor problem is how the ""twist"" was carried out. There is a potentially massive revelation, but it gets written off by two sentences on the screen. The climax becomes an afterthought. There is no falling action. I liked the twist, but I thought it was written off.All in all, this is a good movie - much better than your average Hollywood entertainment. I recommend it if you like to think about movies.",Unbreakable

478,filmLove-2,Disappointing,7,22 December 2000,"Like so many others, I just loved The Sixth Sense. I saw it shortly after it opened in theatres, and enthusiastically waited for the DVD to be released. Watching The Sixth Sense the second time around was just as rewarding a cinema experience as the first. Perhaps even more so. Subsequent viewings have given me even more insight into this marvelous film.So when I learned that M. Night Shyamalan was going to write and direct a new movie with Bruce Willis, I anxiously anticipated its release. I couldn't wait to see Unbreakable.I was very careful to avoid the natural desire to compare Unbreakable with The Sixth Sense. I went out of my way to try to enjoy and evaluate it on its own merits. Furthermore, I admire M. Night Shyamalan and wanted Unbreakable to be a good movie. Alas, it just didn't happen.Despite my enthusiasm, at one point I found myself nodding off. M. Night Shyamalan is a fine screen writer and director, but Unbreakable simply misses the mark. While Unbreakable is not a terrible film it is terribly disappointing. It simply lacks the depth and sophistication of Shyamalan's earlier effort. When it was all over I said to myself, ""So what!""I rate it 7/10",Unbreakable
479,Aidy,Relies too much on the success of 6th Sense,4,5 November 2001,"I seem to be in the rather unique position of being one of the few people who hasn't seen 6th Sense.  I found it odd that almost all reviews include 6th Sense and some people are mad cos it's too much like 6th Sense and some are mad that it isn't like 6th Sense.  So instead of comparing this movie, I am going to review it for what it actually is, a movie in its own right.Unbreakable managed to annoy me from the very opening shot.  The way the characters were framed very narrowly through the gap in the seats got to be very tired very fast.  I don't go to a cinema to watch 10% of the screen and I didn't buy a widescreen television to see 10% of that.  This theme of narrowly framing the characters is carried through the whole movie and is somewhat overused.To me the plot seems like it was taken from a short story, one that was then dragged out to an hour and a half.  This movie would do much better as a 30 minute short as that is about the amount of content in it.  The pace is slow and boring, the whole concept somewhat laughable, and Samuel Jackson is the only redeeming feature.My opinion is totally unbiased, and it seems that this movie is riding far too much on the success of 6th Sense and it simply does not hold water on its own.",Unbreakable
480,buff-18,Better than the 6th Sense,9,5 December 2000,"I may offend thousands of thriller fans who completely loved the 6th Sense, but I feel that Unbreakable topped it. With the 6th Sense, other than the twist at the end (which everyone seemed to eat up) there wasn't really much there. I saw everything in the previews for that Oscar nominee that I cared to or needed to see save the big surprise ending. I give the creators of that film kudos for the twist but feel that it takes more than a big surprise ending to make a film. Unbreakable had what it takes...a developing story along with a twist at the end.Granted the ending of this film wasn't as great a shocker but still gave me a great deal to think about. The camera work in this film was outstanding. We watched scenes take place through the chairs on a train, in the reflection of a TV screen, and through curtains blowing in the wind. The lighting in the film was also beautifully done. I loved the dark, sinister feel the movie had which coincided with Willis' inner turmoil. And the acting was very well done. I became very attached to each character...and Willis' son was a much more convincing and less pitiful character than Haley Joel Osmont's ""I see dead people..."" motif.I liked this movie...I liked almost everything about this movie.

After seeing ""The Sixth Sense,""  I was hoping to find a movie that was as good, if not better, than that.  I was not dissappointed.      The story is based around David Dunne (Bruce Willis) who is the sole survivor of a devestating train accident.  He is later contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes he is, well, unbreakable.  The first part of the movie deals with Elijah tring to convince David of his gift, which leads to the second part of the movie.    The last 45 minutes of this film was intense.  Some of the most intelligent film work was done here.  There is one camera angle with billowing curtains (when you see it, you will be amazed too) that was beautiful and stunning. Also, there are some of the scariest moments (I've ever seen) in this movie.  The entire part with the guy in the red suit had my teeth chattering.  And of course, Shyamalan had a trademark surprise ending.  This one, as in T6S, hits you like a ton of bricks.  When it is revealed, I actually gasped.    Not only is the camera work excellent, the acting is also superb.  Bruce Willis is fantastic.  He should work more often with Shyamalan because it brings out the best in him.  Sam Jackson was also very good, bringing a dark and creepy edge to his character.     All in all, another exellent film by the crew who gave you T6S.

485,noloxtreme,"UNBEATABLE-when you ""Get It""",8,26 October 2007,"Contains a Lot Of SpoilersUnbreakable by Night Shayamalan is a story about a superhero. Shayamalan's interpretation of superhero is between the exaggerated comic book Super hero, and a normal everyday type of hero-like a police officer. To summarize the storyline, David Dunn is the sole survivor of a horrible train wreck, which brings him into the attention of an art dealer, Elijah Price, Elijah has some genetic abnormality which makes his bones very, very weak. David Dunn is a father and is also having marriage problems, but discovers that he can do extraordinary things.Now that the formalities are finished, did I like the movie? After my initial viewing, it left a bad taste in my mouth, I still liked the movie, but I didn't ""get it"". Not that anyone that doesn't like the movie doesn't get it, but here's why I didn't like it initially.The movie ends very abruptly, we go from discovering he is really a super hero, to ending very rapidly, and I felt as if that was rushed. Then again, the climax of movies like The Usual Suspects, The Matrix and The Sixth sense is also based on an abrupt ending, but the delivery here was a bit off. Despite that, the Movie is very good, that's why I gave it a rating of 8, it lost 2 stars because of the abrupt ending, but the movie is exceptional for the reasons given below.Explanation-SpoilersIt's difficult to understand the movie on the first viewing, because of many things, one of those is because of preconceived notion of superheroes. The clichéd superhero movies like the X-men, I kept on waiting for a mad scientist to explain how David Dunn was a mutant because of Gamma ray radiation, but no such explanation came, which was again part of the movies message. The Movie is about a superhero in a real-world type of situation. In fact, Elijah Price repeatedly on many occasions stresses the fact that comic books are an exaggeration of the real world, that is the central theme of this movie. Even when we are introduced to Elijah as an adult, in the very first scene he explains how the original comic book depictions were different from the one's released commercially, that the one's released commercially were an exaggeration. Central theme, which is repeated over and over again. The problem is when you watch this movie expected one type of movie, instead of more of a human drama, involving a hero and his arch-enemy. We are taken on a journey, revealing that David Dunn is indeed a super hero.Typical comic Hero1. At least one person knows their secret, and is their side kick. (David Dunn's son) 2. The woman in the hero's life doesn't know their secret(David Dunn's wife) 3. Weakness(water) 4. Arch-enemy, who is the opposite of the hero(Elijah)Typical comic Villain1. Troubled youth 2. Very intelligent 3. Believes that the ends justify the means, even if the means require the deaths of thousands 4. Criminally insaneThis movie parallels a Typical comic book perfectly, so the movie achieved exactly what it set out to achieve.What's brilliant is that, even at the end of the movie, we are given a hint that Elijah is an arch villain. Elijah's mother tells us about how arch-villains are portrayed in comics. They have larger eyes to indicate that they have a slightly bigger eyes to indicate that they have a skewed way of looking at reality.Anyways, yep, the Movie was Exceptional, once you get it.",Unbreakable
486,PyTom83,M. Night's best movie,8,11 June 2009,"Probably M. Night Shalalaman's best movie, though that isn't saying much, but yes this movie was great. I love the subtle way David Dunn's character is slowly built up and how Elijah basically mirrors him in almost every way; it's a very clever play of the fundamentals set-up by comic books but given a healthy dose of reality and believability with the beginning of American life as a boy and the boy's belief that heroes and villains exist, to a demonstration of how the extreme take on heroes and villains in a comic book is mimicked sometimes perfectly in our modern society. More than anything, it did what Heroes wasn't able to do many years later: transpose superheroes into a believable real world setting.The movie also demonstrates M. Night's ability to use the camera to tell the story; there's a lot of imaginative and creative shots through the whole film (I absolutely love the film's opening with the little girls perspective watching Bruce Willis fumble his way through hitting on the female passenger). I also loved the way the shadows of his rain poncho on his face made it look like he was wearing a superhero mask.My only problem with the movie was the ending; it could have been so much better had it just ended with Bruce's look of shock, and Jackson saying ""they call me Mr. Glass."" The text was very unnecessary. My other complaints was that it had a twist that was obvious, seeing as there was nowhere else for the movie to go after two hours and admittedly, the movie is pretty boring after watching it for a third or fourth time due to the crazy lengths of time where no-one is literally doing anything.",Unbreakable

M.Night is an excellent writer and director for this time and age, and he brings out the best in his actors.

489,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Broken,6,4 December 2015,"Unbreakable is a slow-paced, bizarre mystery/superhero movie. The acting by the two leads is good, especially by Willis. The score, I believe is the best thing about the movie; it is simultaneously soaring and grim. The camera work/direction is intriguing at first, but the repeated experimenting with weird camera angles and positions doesn't add anything to the story and only highlights the fact that we're watching a movie. The concept is where the movie really loses track though. SPOILERS AHEAD The movie expounds on a scenario in which one man learns he has superpowers, and tries to depict how this might play out, realistically, in today's society. What it fails to realise is that the inclusion of superpowers immediately nullifies any possibility of the proceedings being plausible. And so, the movie takes itself way too seriously. As a result, the movie is neither an exciting superhero movie with outlandish yet entertaining characters and situations, nor is it a believable character study on real world human beings; the movie therefore ultimately treads the line between the two, with mediocre outcomes. First out, the beginning to the movie was good and interesting, with the train crash bringing much intrigue over Willis' character's possible 'unbreakability'. I first felt the movie began to go downhill when the Samuel L Jackson character(Elijah) was introduced on screen, because in the first of many monologues he says something along the lines of "" I believe comics are a window to history.."" and then goes on to glorify how comics will forever represent humanity's recollection of history and other such ludicrous dialogue, that the proceedings are strongly shaken off their foundations, truly vibe-kill. At various points in the film he states that there originally is a particular way in which heroes and villains exist, but that they are greatly eschewed in the comics of the time. So while he glorifies comics as windows into our pasts, he also detests them for there less than accurate portrayal of good vs evil. Great character consistency.After much plodding and persistence, Elijah succeeds in convincing David to wonder about his health. Sometime during the movie we find out that David and his wife were involved in a car accident several years ago, with all the papers headlined ""Local football star injured in near fatal car accident"". Elijah alleges that David wasn't injured during the accident, but ""faked it"" because he wanted to find reason to end his football career, which in turn was because he loved Audrey very much and was willing to give up a career in football for her. So, David simply fakes that he was badly injured after the accident, and of course the media and the doctors and the nurses and all people simply take his word for it, and so does Audrey, because she too cites the car accident as a reason for David's not having been able to play football anymore. I just do not get how David managed to convince everyone he was so badly injured that he couldn't pursue a career in football anymore, when he clearly WASN'T injured. Whatever the plot needs, I guess.The son with a gun scene was undoubtedly the best scene in the movie, because it was hilarious. ""Friends don't hurt each other."", or something along those lines, was simply unintentionally hilarious. From the information that David once nearly drowned in a swimming pool in his childhood, Elijah cooks up a fantastical theory about how they both have something in common and that is, their weakness- Water. And that is when Elijah comes to the epic conclusion that water chokes people when it enters there lungs. He says ""Water is his kryptonite"", and while that sounds intense, it is actually incorrect, because water would have been David's kryptonite, only if it was harmless to other humans, but the one thing that Elijah doesn't understand is that all humans can choke on water and die. But, this speech about his weakness is a pep talk for David, because very soon he's convinced that he is a superhero and wants to put his powers to use. He observes many criminals, and reasoning that there acts aren't gruesome enough for his intervention, he searches till he finds a murderer and goes after the man. He kills the man and saves the children and leaves. The next day he shows his son his escapade and tells him not to tell mom. For someone who killed a man last night, for the first time in his life, and realized the implications of his superpowers, David is really chilled out. The end however is underwhelming, with the rest of the movie being about only one thing- David either having or not having superpowers, with information for and against this motion having been provided to us alternatively. David shakes Elijah's hand for the first time, apparently, and thus sees the true horror of Elijah's actions. It's rather odd that in their many interactions, David and Elijah never happened to have brushed past each other previously. But okay, well that's the way it happened, so okay. It was revealed that Elijah is responsible for several major mishaps in the world(or was it city?). How he actually does manage to wreak havoc in so many places is left hanging. He's shown to mull around gathering vital stats and information for his plan and then executing it(the train crash incident). Keep in mind that this man who has supposedly committed grave acts of terror, was not really able to come down a flight of stairs at a hint of a pace, earlier in the movie. His plan to find a hero is frankly very inefficient, but I guess you shouldn't blame bad guys for being bad at what they do.Ultimately, Unbreakable fails due to the method of execution of its concept and certain weak points in plot. Despite all this, some scenes are engrossing.",Unbreakable

491,hijinx,A waste of time.,3,25 November 2000,"I'm very sorry to report that Unbreakable is not what it seems to be.  It seems to be a movie about a man who is, well, unbreakable... Bruce Willis's character, Dunne, appears to be some sort of superhero.Like the other reviews, I'm afraid I can't give away much of the plot without giving away the film.  I will say that the overall main plot is a fine idea, but the execution - particularly in the final third of the film - is a yawner.  The director tries to surprise us as he did in The Sixth Sense, but comes up short.Subplots, which are few and far between, are filled with characters you won't care about.  Only Dunne's son turns in a fair performance, but that's only due to one scene.  We don't get more than a glimpse into the other people: Dunne's wife, Price's mother, Dunne's son.  That'd be fine if the concentration on Dunne was intense and interesting enough to sustain the film.  It's not.I can not overstate how very disappointed I was in this film's all-too-neat wrap up.  It felt, honestly, like I was watching an hourlong TV show that had just 2 minutes left before the credits.  As an added bonus, the overall point and theme of this movie is shrouded in mystery... which, again, would be fine if the film itself was gripping, moving, or soul-stirring.  Too bad it's not.There's no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is blessed with talent.  That talent comes off as an unexciting attempt at some sort of story, here. Maybe next time.  I want my money back.Rating: 1.5 stars (out of 5.)",Unbreakable
492,Tirdun,"Great Fun, Great Movie, Go see.",8,7 August 2001,"Let me start by saying I really enjoyed ""Unbreakable"" from start to finish and will be adding it to my DVD collection shortly. The movie was excellent, great twist at the end. That said, I have two gripes to air:First, while the camera shots (as with Sixth Sense) were usually great, I would often find myself getting dizzy as the camera panned back and forth, back and forth or spun on axis around and around. This is at it's worst during the scene in the train at the beginning of the film, where the camera is shooting between two train seats and moves back and forth a dozen times. I understand it's supposed to be a kid watching between the seats, but I was on the verge of hunting for dramamine.Second, Bruce Willis' character is just about as dumb as a bag of hammers in some areas. If someone asks you if you've ever been sick, and you never have, you should KNOW that. You wouldn't have any IDEA what being sick meant except with other people. You've never had a cold, never thrown up, etc etc. If it was pointed out to you, you should hear bells in your head. (minor spoiler) And if I ever managed bench press every weight in my home gym (plus a cut scene on the DVD shows him at the stadium pressing 500), I'd either know something was really going or somebody snuck something into my wheaties. In all, the movie rocked. 8 out of 10, with me thinking about going back and voting a 9.",Unbreakable
493,Webslinger48,Mixed bag,6,4 December 2000,"Reading through the comments already posted on this film, it's pretty obvious that opinions are divided on Unbreakable, and for good reason...the movie is a mixed bag.  On the one hand, it really is well-crafted, with stellar to serviceable performaces across the board and some pretty taut moments, particularly the beginning and the last twenty minutes.On the other hand, it has a slow second act and falls short in several areas, particularly characterization, emotion and in a few key moments, plausibility.  Yeah, the ending isn't even close to that of Sixth Sense, but anyone really disappointed by that had unrealistic expectations.  The ending works, it just doesn't really add much to what preceded it, while the ending to Sixth Sense cast a new perspective on everything that happened in that entire film.What really bugged me in Unbreakable was the characters motivations were largely unexplained (both for Willis' and Jackson's characters) to the point that the ending really doesn't pay off the way it is meant to, because we don't really buy it.And as a tribute to the comic book genre, I think it fails.  What makes the comic book genre so great is the how fantastic the stories, the characters, the action is.  To try to ground that in the real world is like trying to take the tackling out of football.  You change it's essence so much that what's left constitutes but a shadow of what makes the real thing so great.Now the hype around Shyamalan will dim a bit, as well it should, as we wonder whether he's a one-trick pony.  I bet he comes back big next time, hopefully riding on something that's different for him and doesn't rely so heavily on a surprise ending.  My rating: 6.5/10",Unbreakable
494,anderst2,Close to Perfect,9,19 October 2002,"This is one of the few movies that come close to being perfect. It has an amazing story to tell, but it's the sort of movie you get more out of the first time by NOT knowing much about it, I didn't and it took me by surprise. If you might think you want to see it, don't read any more, just see it, for the rest of this text might contain spoilers.This movie is far superior to M. Night Shayamalan's breakthrough film ""The Sixth Sense"", because where ""The Sixth Sense"" is a movie that looses it shock effect after the first viewing, ""Unbreakable"" is a movie that should have to be watched over and over, and it even getting better. This movie is a perfect exsample of the impact Steven Spielberg has had on the up-coming generation of film-makers, you can clearly see that Shayamalan has taken Spielbergs understated cinematography and uses it to perfection, look at the three sequences, 1-where Elijah get his comic book, how the camera follows it, 2-when David works out, and 3-when David carries Audrey back into their releationship. It sets the mood, and it's perfect. All the way through Shayamalan uses this understated cinematography to get us into the story and to get us to feel how the characters feel. And maybe the one with the biggest impact, where David rises from the swimming pool, the pictures tells the story.In a few years, this is the movie that M. Night Shayamalan is gonna be remembered for, not ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"", this is the one. The only thing that holds it from being perfect is that many will be thrown of by the slow-paced and un-conventional story of a Superhero to be, this is not like any ""Superman"" or ""Spider-Man"" movie, this is real.This is a Masterpiece, and it's totally ""Unbreakable"".11/10",Unbreakable
495,coasterrd,the best film of the year.,10,4 July 2001,Unbreakable is NOT to be compared with the sixth sense. They are very different from each other in MANY ways. With that aside this movie had me glued to my seat throughout. I just finished it an hour ago and I just started whatching it again. This and sixth sense will be in my dvd collection sometime this week. The only way this compares to the sixth sense is that they both have unexpected and jaw dropping endings.

Night Shylaman is a gifted director indeed and I look forward to seeing his future films.,Unbreakable
496,Otis Lou Bohr,Better Than (And Completely Different To) That Other Movie He Made,10,26 June 2001,"You know, I liked ""The Sixth Sense"", I really did, it was atmospheric and original--but I wasn't so awestruck that the mere words ""by the director of 'The Sixth Sense'"" would have been sufficient to lure me into the theatre to see ""Unbreakable"". Rather, it was the delight and enthusiasm expressed by various comic book fans that got me interested. From the advertisements I'd half-watched, it certainly didn't come across as the next ""X-Men"". But being a graphic novel aficionado of modest proportions myself (or possibly a complete geek with more bagged ""Howard The Duck"" back-issues than brains, depending on one's perspective) I went, and watched, and came away from it appropriately impressed. In fact it held the coveted ""Best Film Since 'Fight Club'"" position in my completely subjective and personal top twenty list for the several intervening months before I saw ""Memento"".I don't think you have to be a comic book fan to appreciate this movie, although it must certainly help to have some exposure to the genre, an awareness of its tropes and conventions.Alternatively I wonder if being a big fan of ""The Sixth Sense"" might not hinder one's enjoyment of ""Unbreakable"", inasmuch as the director's distinctive style is used to very different (and in my opinion far better) effect here.",Unbreakable

498,gregopego12,disappointment/ depressing,3,18 February 2006,"I liked the Sixth Sense, for the most part, and Signs (I haven't seen the other ones), but I can't recommend Unbreakable for the same reasons that I don't like parts of the other two, mentioned, movies. M. Night Shamalayan's movies contain nuggets of scary ""real world"" situations that I really don't want to sit in a movie theater and watch. I don't want to think about gun play or psychotic mothers a la The Sixth sense, or slow deaths from car crashes a la Signs. However, both of those movies had very compelling stories and Mr. Shamalayan managed to keep me to the end (fine acting helped also). Unbreakable could've been as good, but it's long and just too bleak. It's great the way Bruce Willis discovers his superpowers, and there is some fine interaction between Samuel L. Jackson and him, but the movie veers into the dark corners of the minds of everyday lowlifes committing wanton acts of abuse that this story leads you to believe are commonplace--they could be going on right now outside the theater or in your very home! The climax features a burglary that ventures into disturbing Thomas Harris-type situations. After the resolution and the surprise ending, you're left wondering ""what did I watch this for?"" If you rent this, I suggest you pick up Anchorman, Eurotrip, or your favorite comedy to chase this one down--you'll need it.",Unbreakable
499,lraimundo,An Underrated Modern Classic,10,13 August 2018,"I'm shocked to see that right now, 17 years after the release of this movie, only 300.000 people had rated it, and has a 7.3 total average. This movie deserves so much more. 
 I'm gonna get technical first, and then I'll analyze it's simbolism and meaning more deeply.
 The plot is a thrilling story, extremely careful assuring it hasn't plot holes or conveniences. The story develops differently in each scene, and gets progressively more unrealistic. Right from the start we get to know the characters (David Dunn and Elijah Price), both in very good sequences, filmed, almost entirely, in only one take. The whole movie is filmed with great sequences and shots, resembling to the comic books panels, with low camera movement and very simmetric shots. It make me think on Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' because of how the perspective changes slightly on panel to panel. Attached to this is the color palette, each character wearing a distinctive color, in a sometimes contrasting or matching environment. 
 Enough with the technical. Let's dive deeper. The way the movie loses it's realism throughout the scenes is a very realistic iteration of how would be the life if superheroes were real, and how this gifted beings would discover and develop their powers, and weaknesses, slowly and with baby steps before jumping to the sky and start punching bad guys, figuratively speaking. The figure of the villain is also well portrayed here, showing how a comic book villain reacts to the world surrounding him, he's motives and how he feels about the hero. 
 If you are expecting a Marvel or DC like superhero movie, this is not your type of movie. This can't be fully considered a superhero movie, though. It's much more than that, just as 'The Dark Knight'.",Unbreakable
500,paulmg,Entertaining and cerebral,10,24 November 2000,"Many will walk out of this film disgusted for one of two reasons:1. The film failed to be The Sixth Sense 2.2. The film was trying too hard to be The Sixth Sense 2.In fact, it is the audience that wants so bad to see The Sixth Sense 2 that many are not going to be able to appreciate this film for what it really is, or understand the comments it makes about our own fascination with and need for heroes. This is a much more cerebral film than its predecessor. It is slow-moving, deliberate, and cautious. This is very much a drama with strange, supernatural undertones. And those undertones are very subtle. While the previous film was a mind game with the audience, this is a mind game between the characters.The ending does have a twist, yes, but nowhere near the kind of twist The Sixth Sense had. It doesn't even try to duplicate that. It does change the way you look at the events you saw in the film, but not so much that you want to race back in and see it again to see if they pulled a fast one. It simply forces you try to make sense of the psychology of a certain character in the film.The one flaw to this film is the very end, where we are told the fates of two major characters. Perhaps, since the film deals with comic books, this was intended to be comic, but I don't think the filmmakers actually intended for the audience to laugh at this moment, which is what happened when I saw the film, with an audience that had, up to that point, been enjoying themselves.",Unbreakable
501,garuda4,"Another thoughtful, fantastical tale from Shyamalan.",7,25 November 2000,"This fantastical tale from the director of sixth sense takes us into another realm of the; ""it could happen""-""yeah in your dreams"", that Shyamalan creates and takes us into with such gentle persuasion. Bruce Willis is a dull everyman with an unwordly gift...or two, or more. When I realised what world we were being brought into I wanted to shake my head in disbelief, but such is the Director's charm that I wanted more and more.If you accept the premise you'll probably like this movie. My wife, on the other hand, had a fit of the giggles on a number of occasions. It's just that easy to find the movie either enthralling or ridiculous. It moves rather ponderously, but I didn't mind it, as it sets us up for the complete change of pace towards the end. Shyamalan again shows his uncanny ability to pick child stars, Bruce's son is played by Spencer Treat Clark, who comes close to stealing the movie with his earnest portrayal of a boy wanting his dad to be a somebody. Robin Penn is also good as Bruce's patient wife. Shyamalan again appears in his own movie in a scene I did not quite understand. Was it meant to show Bruce's fallibilities? There is again a surprising twist at the end, and although I was intrigued by it, Shyamalan robs it of it's interest by stopping the movie and wrapping it up abruptly and unsatisfactorily.",Unbreakable
502,theedcarol,Good ending but a little slow moving.,7,5 September 2001,Enjoyed the plot twists and thought that the acting was good. The movie dragged at times but it kept me interested.

503,egasulla,Yet another Shyamalan horror (of a movie),2,25 January 2019,"The good thing is, there's no way this review contains spoilers. Because I could not watch it till the end.The only Shyamalan film I watched complete is ""Signs"", because one of my kids must have liked it and bought the DVD. The movie was bad enough, but the ending was beyond bad. So I crossed him off my list of ""want to watch"" directors. However, Xfinity was nice enough to reward viewers with a ""free movie week"", so I gave this flick a try.I like films where I truly care for the characters. I don't mind if they're starkly realistic or crazy fantastic: I have shed a tear for a stop motion corpse (The Corpse Bride). In ""Unbreakable"", I could not give a flying piece of you-know-what for the fate of the characters.So David Dunn is invulnerable? Great for him. And Elijah Price is fragile, and harbors a deep resentment for it? Boo-hoo. Had the characters both exploded halfway through the movie, I would have celebrated it, assuming maybe now we'll focus on David's kid, or his wife, or Elijah's mom. But nope: we keep hearing them preach about... the importance of comic books. And I thought ""Ready Player One"" was dumb because it shamelessly appeal to video crazed kids, making them feel their gaming is truly important: turns out comic book fans already had their ""feel important"" movie. And it was just as awful.",Unbreakable
504,Travixius,Still my favourite film.,10,24 February 2008,"I watched Unbreakable again the other day, for about the 20th time and it's still my favourite film of all time. I am by no means a casual viewer and have seen thousands of films in my life but this movie just speaks to me. In part I guess that this has to be because the protagonist, David Dunn has a life that mirrors my own in many ways (without the superpowers of course) but also because it reveals the human condition and our potential to all be heroic. Also having grown up reading comics this film addressed how comics have shaped popular culture in the 20th century and became modern myth. A couple of years ago I spoke to the owner of a Comics store here in South Australia who said he didn't like the film because (spoiler ahead) the villain created the hero. I found that opinion bizarre since this has always been the case in comics and fiction in general, for without evil to fight there is no need of a hero. I enjoyed Shymalan's first three films immensely and it is a shame that this film was in many ways considered a disappointment both critically and financially after the success of The Sixth Sense. Anyway if you haven't seen this movie, I recommend it. Superb acting with Bruce Willis in top form, a fantastic score by James Newton Howard and excellent cinematography. Check it out.",Unbreakable
505,Rainy-3,An original and interesting movie,8,24 November 2000,"Unbreakable was a very enjoyable and thought provoking movie, mixed with equal parts suspense, comedy, drama, and action.  The movie, while not an edge of your seat thriller, was able to keep interest in it from the beginning to the end with subtle revelations and plot expansion. The largest fault in the film which deals with pacing.  The movie is slow, and there are a lot of times when it seems as though the pace should be picked up a couple of notches. Unbreakable is not the Sixth Sense, thank goodness.  There were similarities, as there would be in any directors films, such as his use of color to offer visual clues and emotional weight.  Given the comic book backdrop of the plot, I think that the use of color is more fitting in this movie, assigning the colors much as a comic book artist would.  There is also the idea of a ""surprise ending"" that is carried over from the Sixth Sense, however the ending is not nearly as crucial as it was in the earlier movie.  In the Sixth Sense, the ending was crucial to the plot.  The ending ""reinvented"" the movie, and it was in many ways the defining moment of the movie.  In Unbreakable, the ending was there to fill in the gaps in the plot, gaps that I generally noticed, then forgot about, and which were all brought together in the end. This was a fine movie, it is a fun concept that everybody at one time has thought about, and it puts forward fantastical ideas with the foundation being real people with real problems, real jobs, and real lives.",Unbreakable
506,DunkD,Laughable,2,9 January 2001,"This film seriously p***ed me off.  Up till the last 20 minutes I found myself liking this film despite its many flaws - there was something about the patheticness of the main characters, and the deadpan understated non-delivery of the lines that I found endearing.  But then what a last 20 minutes - totally blew the film for me, and I nearly choked laughing at how poor the whole thing revealed itself to be.There is so much wrong, but where to start?  The writer probably had a good idea, but that idea probably wasn't worth the bother of scripting.  I find it hard to believe that any more than one person felt it worth their while to involve themselves in this film.So - Bruce Willis is a dull security guard, with a dull wife and a demented child.  After being the sole survivor of a train crash Willis meets the odd Mr Glass who reckons Willis is a super hero.  Somehow Samuel L. Jackson's character has made a lot of money out of selling old comic books - the first evidence that this film must take place in an alternative universe!I won't spoil the twist ending for you.  It spoils the movie, so I would walk out just before Bruce is in the station in his Security cape. Really. Leave then, and you may get off lightly with the feeling of watching a quirky but dull movie.If you stay you will get more Hitchcockesqe posturing camera techniques, more music that is just plain wrong and more sulky faces from everyone on screen.What really did it for me was M. Night Shyamalan's cameo.  This guy really has a high opinion of himself that is totally laughable and pretty much sums up the whole movie.If you remember one thing from this review it is this.  WALK OUT OF THIS MOVIE!",Unbreakable
507,QueenMag,Fable about Self-Realization,7,16 May 2001,"Unbreakable is quiet and moody. The style is very still and almost claustrophobic, as though the world the characters live in is very small. I liked this, but more than that I loved the story, which is about discovery... self-realization. It was something I could relate to my own life and experience. The director picked a risky subject for a big-budget film. I like the way he depicts husbands and wives; the relationship between David (Willis) and Audrey (Wright Penn) is very beautiful. I could feel their awkwardness, their sorrows, their hopes. The director is very special in that he has the ability to create a plot so grand that it bears hard on the imagination, yet he keeps his characters subtle and ordinary. This is a good balance. The result is drama, not melodrama. Due to its pacing (compare a vinyl record to a compact disc), lack of special effects, and melancholy tone (without horror or gore as a ""reason""), this film will not appeal to a lot of people. Personally, it was one of my top five films of 2000.",Unbreakable
508,Pebble-2,It could have been so much better...,7,30 June 2002,"This film could have been great.  There was an intriguing plot behind it all and a quality cast.  Unfortunately, Bruce Willis gives a reprise of his 6th Sense performance (under-acted and wooden) and whilst it may have worked in 6th Sense it was completely out of place here.  And the script for the most part was either hopelessly unrealistic (with Willis' screen family communicating in knowing looks and monosyllabic utterances) or cringeworthy (some of Jackson's more prosaic lines).  I love films that are about extraordinary things happening to ordinary people, but the characters in this film were just to weird to begin with so the effect was lost.  On a plus note the photography was excellent (alebeit with the director's slightly heavy-handed imagery) and Jackson commanded the screen every time he was on it (no mean feat with the script).  I just think it could have been so much better with a better dramatic actor playing the lead (sorry Bruce!) and a script that didn't try and load every line with a sense of mystery.  The Green Mile is an example of how it could have been done. Still, 7/10 ain't bad.",Unbreakable

512,gonzofilms,The birth of a new way...,8,22 August 2001,"First and foremost, let's stop comparing M. Night's creation with the Sixth Sense.  It's unfair to make comparisons especially when both movies are completely different and have nothing in common other than the fact that Bruce Willis stars in both (good for you Bruce, your agent is doing a great job in getting you excellent scripts).MY REVIEW IS LOADED WITH SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK... I saw this movie for the first time on DVD. God bless DVD. Not only did I thouroughly enjoyed this film, but 3 of the deleted scenes were absolutely remarkable. While I agree for different reasons that these scenes should have been cut from the movie, having them on DVD is a satisfying finale.Where to begin? 1) This was the most realistic story about a fictitious theme...the making of a superhero (LOL).  In fact, this might be the first superhero movie in which 95% is devoted to his roots. I applaud M. Night for not be so hasty to go ""hollywood"" on this one. By that I mean that M. Night could have compressed the theme to make time for the superhero to do more of his ""superhero"" stuff.2) The acting was very good.  M. Night's soft spoken characters and quiet ambience, makes his stories even deeper than the way in which the screenplay is written. Sam Jackson is good from the moment he appears, but Bruce really surprised me. True, he was not reading Othello, however he did a nice job in bringing his persona to life with an excellent performance.3) James Newton Howard's score is absolutely magnificent. Thanks to the DVD, I now own the CD soundtrack.  The only gripe however, is that they drowned out Sam Jack's final lines. The music used at that point was spectacular, but so was Sam's lines. If I wanted to hear music over words, I could watch MTV for free.4) The cinematography was slow, methodic and manipulating.  It reeled you in and made you focus on angles that were not only creative from the perspective of the director, but significantly meaningful to the feel of the film.5)The lighting was not too dark as I read other peoples' comments. Moreover, the lighting was very delicately staged. Take David Dunn's security cape, for example. It is dark when he follows ""Mr. Orange"" to the home that he ransacked, because it is night and it is raining. Once in the house however, the cape takes a shape of it's own. It gets bluer and looks more detailed as the movie continues.  There was no mistake in their making the connection between lighting and significance. 6) A silly one...Sam Jackson's styled hairdo a-la Frederick Douglass, and purple clothing is the real deal.The movie was not excellent, but it was rewarding, unique, and I welcome a sequel.",Unbreakable
513,hasekamp,Most disappointing!,1,14 November 2001,"After having seen ""The Sixth Sense"", I had high expectations for this new movie by the same team. Seldom have I been disappointed more by a movie than by this one: There is hardly anything surprising in the plot. What it is all about (why is the main character ""unbreakable""?) is not explained or even suggested and many of the scenes have hardly anything to do with the story line. And what has the strange relationship of the main character and his wife to do with the rest of the plot? Furthermore I had problems to keep my eyes open. The ""action"" is so slow. Can it be that I did not understand anything about it because I am not a fan of comic books? I doubt it. Any movie should at least be interesting by its action, photography, acting or whatever else. This one isn't. I have seen enough films I did not really like that were at least interesting to watch. But this one is simply boring.",Unbreakable
514,p_adkins2004,Its all perspective,7,12 April 2007,"I've seen this film before but was looking through my DVD collection to find a film my kid brother could watch with me, without it being a kids film or a comedy. And I found this. In fact, I think M. Night Shyamalan are great for films to watch with people of all ages, as although they explore fairly gritty and dark ideas they are fairly family friendly.On second viewing, I liked this film about as much I did the first time round - I like it, but it holds itself back. A lot.Firstly, the setup is ridiculous, as a 'comic book' film set in reality the concept of Bruce Willis's invincible character seems a little too far fetched to ever be used a relatable figure to the audience, through whom the audience's perceptions are questioned. Unlike Night's other films where the hero's tend to be everyday sorta people (such as Gibson in Signs), Willis is a character totally out of place in the viewer's universe.The climax of the film is under-developed, with the kidnap plot thrown into the film far too late, and so as the 'actiony' finale lacks any really weight or significance which it craves.However, this film is not all about special powers or Willis's character, if you look carefully it's a film about perception. Using the directive (is that a word? I doubt it) masterfully, Night subtly sprinkles the film with ideas and shots in which the viewer's perception is brought into play. For example in the final scene of reconciliation between Willis and his wife, their son is shown in full shot filling a glass up midway of of orange juice, the camera then focuses in on this glass next to the newspaper with Willis on the headline, a metaphor surely for the films objective of asking is the glass ever really half empty? This is further emphasised by the decent twist (c'mon on its a Night film, of course it has a twist), in which the viewer is left wondering whether the set villain is actually the hero of the film.I like this film, mainly due to it's direction and thought provoking message, however as a blockbuster or an entertainment flick I can understand why people think it doesn't stand-up compared to the rest of the blockbusters filling up the local odeons.",Unbreakable

OK That being said, The Sixth Sense was at least watchable. This snooze fest is an insult to every comic-reader, train conductor, cripple, security guard and super-hero. None would want to actually see this movie. Unwatchable is more like it. Bruce Willis acts like he took too much NyQuil and is sleepy, and Sam Jackson just showed up and limped.

519,Sting-11,Better than The Sixth Sense?,8,6 January 2001,"YES! This is an excellent movie and I know when watching a movie you shouldn't compare it to others, but how can you not compare this to the sixth sense.
(*Spoilers Ahead*) People may say you need to like comics to like this movie, but this is not true at all. I don't think i've ever fully read a comic book in my life and it didn't effect my opinion of this movie at all. All you need to know about comic books is told in the movie. You may also think that a good versus evil type movie might not be that great but you don't even realise it is a good versus evil movie till the end.People say the story is a little weak and I would have to agree with this, though it doesn't mean the movie is bad at all. The acting was brilliant by everyone. I had given up on Bruce Willis until I saw this movie, he along with Samuel L. Jackson was great. The camera effect when Bruce Willis is seeing what bad thing a person has done is brilliant, this is especially shown in the train station. The super hero stuff, like when he goes and saves those kids is also cool.The thing that made the sixth sense so good was the twist. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but after seeing Unbreakable you become aware of this. Unbreakable couldn't simply rely on a twist ending like the sixth sense because people were prepared for it, M. Night Shyamalan knew this and still pulled off a great twist ending,imust admit i did guess the ending but only when i heard Elijah's mother talking about the villains in comic books near the end of the movie. That's when i realised the villain in the movie was missing and that Elijah's mother, in a way was describing Elijah. What made it better that the sixth sense was how David Dunn saw all the bad things Mr. Glass had done.9/10",Unbreakable
520,Floop1977,Great Movie - Pity about the Last 10 seconds!,8,1 December 2000,"Wow - what a great movie! The plot of this movie, which is based around the hypothesis that comic strip is a form of history telling, and that it's characters have some sort of basis in reality - i.e. people with great strength, or special powers - is pretty far-fetched, as serious movies go.However in the hands of M. Night Shyamalan, the pace of the movie rarely falters. His skill as a film maker is evident throughout, with exceptional camera work and direction - he has really brought excellent performances out of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, actors who when left to their own devices have shown tendencies to merely 'be themselves'. Also noteworthy is the performance by Spencer Treat Clark as the son of Bruce Willis' character, which is moving yet restrained, which must have been difficult after the pressure of following Osment's turn in the 6th Sense.I liked the ending, apart from the last 10 seconds which were dreadful and I cannot believe the director insisted on the 'text epilogue' which is given. In movies which are clearly not based on real life events, it is utter stupidity to have a text epilogue which suggests what happened to the characters, it would have been much better simply ending - why spoil a mesmerizing, thoughtful film by asking us to walk out of the cinema with that thought in mind? Similarly this occurred in a much less good film, Rules of Engagement, but with similar results.I did however like the general end of the movie, and would recommend it to everybody. Many people are unfairly bashing this movie and comparing it to the Sixth Sense, but in my opinion, it is a very well made, intriguing film.",Unbreakable
521,Bronis,"Oooooo... Bad movie... Pointless and too similar to ""The Sixth Sense""",2,28 November 2000,"What can you say. Another colossal disappointment from the director of the wildly overrated ""The Sixth Sense"". The teaser/trailor sold me that this one could be a thrilling and mysterious flick, but it fails... miserably.M. Knight Shyamalan holds his shots too still which makes the film's first hour and a quarter boring as hell. Just like his last film, it isn't until about the last third when the ball gets rolling. Yet this ball rolls into the gutter. The twists here are almost identical to the last film and the payoff is just not strong enough to compensate for the hour or so that we've been waiting... patiently... for SOMETHING... ANYTHING to happen.
Without giving anything away, I must say that I like comic books as much as any 12 year old kid, but the inclusion of that form of print is completely silly here. Plus, comics are not meant to be taken as seriously as they are here.Maybe I missed something. I don't know. But what I saw was a decent looking piece of crud. Shyamalan, Bruce Willis, and Samuel L. Jackson might not be blamed for this horrible film. Instead, the blame might be placed on the eager film execs who greenlit this project to ride on the coat-tails of ""The Sixth Sense"".I heard ""Unbreakable"" is part of a trilogy. God help us all.

To be fair the film had its genuinely original moments( exclusively around the Samuel Jackson character), but it spent too much time trying to echo its predecessor, The Sixth Sense, and to prove to the audience that it was an ""honest, thoughtful"" film.  Each minute of this film was agonizing, passing at roughly the same speed of time spent in a doctor's waiting room.  By the time the final scene rolled around with its disappointing denoument, I felt that I, too, had an unrecognized superhuman ability--the one needed to endure over two hours of boring, barely edited junk without demanding my money back.

I liked the first half an hour of it, I thought it had set up a lot of good ideas for an interesting plot, but then it just degenerated rapidly until it had become ridiculous. *spoiler alert* DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE It started to go off the plot totally when Bruce Willis's character (forgot his name) went off to that mans house, and suddenly people were tied up and then he hit the man and- well, what? I didn't have a clue what the hell that was all about. It was just ridiculous. And then when he fell in the pool, I thought that was going to be a really good too. But no. What the hell was the point in saying that his weakness was water? They could at least have done something with the bit in the pool, but he just got out of it again. The bit about his weakness was pointless really. And the ending, it was just so rushed. It was done too quickly and it didn't give you time to make sense of it. People say it is better than the Sixth Sense, but they must be living on a different planet or something because the sixth sense was a million times better than this drivel.

Night Shamalayan's previous film, ""The Sixth Sense,"" and those comparisons will be slightly unfair, because while the two movies look the same on the surface, they are different as well. This story of a normal guy (Bruce Willis) whose life is turned topsy-turvy when he survives a devastating train crash with nary a scratch on him is actually slightly lighter in tone that ""The Sixth Sense,"" even in its darker moments. What ""Unbreakable"" is, in essence, is a solid yarn. When it gets to where it's going (what little has been given away in the excellent marketing of the movie happens in the first 10 minutes), you may roll your eyes a bit, but bear with it  it all comes together, right down to the now-expected Shamalayan twist. The young director is the best thing to happen to Willis as a film actor  he's done his best work in this film and last year's ""Sixth Sense."" And I think that Samuel L. Jackson, as the mysterious figure who opens Willis' eyes to his possibilities, does Oscar-caliber work here as well.

However, the over build of tension to the end of the movie was a sore let down once the audience found out the big question that fueled the movie. Honestly, I did not find the subject matter all that suspenseful. One could almost see it coming, whether or not they are moderate to avid comic book fans. I think M.

537,Speedy_Lube,I YEARNED for more from this film.,8,4 March 2003,"What an excellent concept for a film. I have always believed that where so many comic-book films have failed is in their inability to recognize that all great superheroes are human. They have lives, parents, friends, lovers, flaws, jobs, and they even sit on the crapper occasionaly.Perhaps this is why I so deeply appreciate this film, more so than Shamalan's previous effort, The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable examines an underexplored gold mine of dramatic goodies, and does so with deep and complex dialogue and plot development.The major flaw of this film is that going into it, as with all Shamalan films, I was expecting a great surprise ending. Instead, I got one that, while very clever and equally dramatic, didn't have the impact that Sixth Sense's did.This is countered, however, by the raw emotion of the ending, and the sense you get that the story has only just begun, done very much in the comic-book style fashion.A great film, not without flaws, but worth at least one viewing, if only for the excellent performances and great dialogue. 8/10",Unbreakable
538,Tom-But,"From that Indian guy who brought you dead people, aliens and killer plants... Seriously.",6,11 April 2011,"I'm writing too many reviews these days, wasting time on it even. Tragic but it's true. I don't even know if anyone's bothered to read them yet, though strangely my notice of Slumdog Millionaire was helpful to 0 out of 2 people. Well, perhaps not that strange...But, I digress: for anyone who cares, I'm just gonna start giving brief summaries of the five aspects of the films I review, the aspects being those that I find the most relevant to virtually all cinema. These will be, in no particular order: acting, writing, directing (including cinematography and technical aspects, such as editing and sound mixing) and longevity/chance for repeated viewings.Anyway...Screenplay: The story is that of a comic book origin tale, revamped for modern times, in which a man (Willis) realises that he possesses the gift of virtual invulnerability when he survives a horrific train crash. This is given much more credibility than you might imagine by Shyamalan's restrained treatment of the subject matter. This bloke doesn't sport groin-grabbingly distasteful attire and leap from tall buildings, but instead discovers his hidden abilities through the progression of a slow yet captivating plot, strewn with naturalistic and attentive dialogue, especially the stuff betwixt him and his soon-to-be ex-wife. My favourite written moment (which can be forgiven for seeming a little out of place amongst these otherwise brooding characters) is Elijah (the invaluable Samuel L. Jackson) rebuking a customer in his store (""Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face..."" etc. Classic!). The ending... I'll come back to that. Actors: Bruce Willis rarely gets a chance to showcase the depth and subtlety that he applies here to Daniel Dunn. Yes, he has a gift in that lines like ""Yippee ki-yay, motherf*cker!"" seem almost poetic coming out of his mouth, but who knew he had the ability to convey such conflicted and relocatable emotions, made all the more remarkable when considering the, to be fair, absurdity of some of the situations. This same platitude is extended to Jackson, whose fiery and intelligent charisma helps to give some plausibility to his quite ridiculous sensibilities. He also uses discreet mannerisms, in his speech and gestures, to allude to some hidden undertones regarding his feelings towards Daniel. Is it envy he harbors, or something greater? Something deeper?Direction: As with his best films (The Sixth Sense, Signs), Shyamalan creates an indelible atmosphere in which this story unfolds. The eerie tones are emphasised by well-placed silences and close-ups, while the more frightening moments are defined by lucid lighting and jagged editing. He even uses a not-too-flashy flourish in the opening scene on the train, a long shot without a cut in which Daniel and a stranger's conversation is portrayed through by the camera switching perspective from behind a chair, implicitly seen through the eyes of a curious child. Potential for repeat viewings: I've just realised that I haven't said a great deal bad about this film, and so I can hardly be justified in giving it a 6. Well, it might help at this point to say that this is my second time watching Unbreakable, and I don't believe I will be rushing back for a third. Yes, it was a pleasant surprise on most counts, a realistic (or close as you can get) superhero movie, without all the overdone conventions. But, to be fair, it is a very slight topic, carried off at an almost disarmingly plodding pace, resulting in a semi-satisfying climax and a less-so denouement. Because this ending, to be honest, is a little WTF; maybe Shyamalan thought that his audiences had come to expect an arbitrary pay-off, a sideswipe that no reasonable person would see coming, a la The Sixth Sense. That reveal was well- executed and actually quite ingenious in that it facilitated all the requirements of the plot while retaining its shock. This one isn't as good, rushed and fairly well impertinent to everything that has come before. But I suppose, in Shyamalan's defense, if you took it away, all those eerie, creepy undertones that you get from Jackson's character would just seem artificial, and they are somewhat necessary to the plot, I suppose.So, 6/10. The lesser of Shyamalan's good phase... which, at this stage, seems indefinitely the have concluded. A shame.",Unbreakable

540,Laurie Mann,"Good Flick if You Like Quiet, Intense Movies",7,23 November 2000,"If you liked The Sixth Sense, you should like Unbreakable.  There are certain aspects of Unbreakable that were very much in play in The Sixth Sense - Bruce Willis, a sensitive boy, Philadelphia,subtle music, shadows and a sense of isolation.  This movie is even quieter than The Sixth Sense, so if you found Sixth Sense slow going, you'll find this more so.  (In fact, you could pretty easily knock at least three scenes out of the movie and not loose a thing.)That said, I think Shyamalan is one of the best commercial movie makers out there today.  I like eerie, atmospheric movies that don't rely on grossness and hyperbolic action substitute for plot and character.  Both Willis and Jackson are wonderful in their roles as a lucky security guard and an unlucky comic art collector.Yes, there is an undercurrent of the fantastic in this movie; probably not enough to take the Dramatic Presentation Hugo from something ""more obvious"" like X-Men or Gormenghast.  There were a few funny bits about comics fandom (by inference).  Samuel L.Jackson's gallery was pretty tony for a comic art gallery.  And there's another bit (the movie's most unnecessary scene) with Jackson in a comic store and the sales clerk has no idea who he is.  Major comics or science fiction collectors are always well-known by the local sellers.About the twist - I had two ideas about what I thought the twist would be. I was dead wrong on one, and half right on the other one.  It's a great twist and works very well.",Unbreakable

Thankfully, both are far from being run-of-the-mill: they present thought-provoking (if fanciful) scenarios that reward those willing to suspend disbelief based on a small set of assumptions.It's really difficult to discuss the merits of the film without giving much away--perhaps IMDB should create a section for people who have watched the film to discuss it without spoiling it for those who haven't.  Let me just say that I did not find the film boring; on the contrary, I was fascinated and found the pace to be just right.

Such as when the son suddenly points a gun at his father to show that Pops is a superhero. This comes out of nowhere. Also, Willis's catatonic performance worked well in Sixth Sense because he had a stunningly good child actor to fill the gaps. Here Willis isn't surrounded by that talent level.

546,Mr Dread,Genius film maker! Simply amazing...,10,25 November 2000,"(A+) M Night Shyamalan has just made my top 5 directors list. This was simply an amazing film and, like its predecessor, it has affected me greatly once again. And who ever said that Bruce Willis' acting is not satisfactory in this movie is sadly mistaken. Once again, he was really good.When I exited the theater, all I could think of was how talented the creator of this movie is. I was really worried that he's nothing but a one-hit-wonder -- but he's not! ""He did it again!"" as some of the previous reviewer's have said.The movie contains many great shots and many symbolic scenes (if you watch closely). Everyone involved in this movie did a tremendously good job. And if this movie won't get nominated for an Oscar I'm gonna get really p***ed.Samuel L Jackson was also fantastic as Elijah Price - the total opposite of David Dunne (Bruce Willis). Both characters were VERY believable.And even though the idea for this movie is really quite uncanny, you can almost believe that something like that could really happen.One piece of advice to those who haven't seen the movie yet but enjoyed Sixth Sense. Don't compare the movie to Sixth Sense, and forget what you heard about this movie.

Night Shyamalan movies because he is arguably the most inconsistent director working today. He's made great movies like this one, The Sixth Sense and Signs and he's also made terrible ones like, The Last Airbender and The Happening. But enough about M. Night let's talk about Unbreakable starring Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson.I'm gonna start off with the bad things this time because I want to end it off on a high note. The only problems I have with this movie is that there is this one part of the score that the filmmakers used during this intense scene (which I won't spoil) and the music is really bad and didn't fit the scene at all, but it wasn't enough to ruin the scene. Another problem I had that took me out of the film is at the beginning Sam Jackson's suit really distracting but after a while I accepted it, especially considering that Shyamalan created this heightened world within Unbreakable.The cinematography is very impressive and has a personality to it and in itself is kind of a character. The score (besides the one previously mentioned) fits the movie very well. The editing is really good. The writing, directing and overall story is brilliant and subtle. Samuel L Jackson's character's (Elijah) phycology and theory is very interesting. Bruce Willis' character (David) has no phycology really, (and if he does it doesn't really matter to the plot) and he sort of develops one by the end of the movie. All of the actors bring their A game and deliver a convincing performance.There isn't much to say it's just a very good movie. I can't really talk about much else without spoiling anything.

555,ROCKAFELLA71,A Super hero before he becomes a super hero?,8,20 December 2007,"A few people I spoke with did not get this movie. I got it but only after the 3rd time watching it because truth be told, this movie is really about a superhero coming to be and accepting the fact that he is a Superhero. Now that statement alone is not saying much, I mean you look at Spiderman and Batman, as well as other DC comic heroes and the one thing that they all have in common is the superhero comes into existence but this is the fist time I have ever seen a movie that focuses on the development of the superhero solely. By the time he realizes what he is the movie ends. Therefore I truly wish there was a sequel. By the way I really like this film. M. Night Shyamalan directs a superb very odd film with barely any music in the background which makes the viewer rely more on the story in my opinion. The only survivor in a crash who brushes up against people and can view their terrible acts and than finds he is basically invincible (except for his weakness water) with super human strength is a brilliant plot. The evil Mr. Glass played by Samuel L.Jackson who you don't know he's evil until the end. I thought he was an artist with insight. M. Night Shyamalan was great to tackle heroism from this point of view because it has not been done before. I think this film is underrated because some people don't think in terms of becoming the superhero who always was but rather one who transforms into one because of some special event. But Once again I wish there was a sequel.",Unbreakable
556,wembleyfm,Captivating,8,4 November 2015,"The suspense in this film builds up nicely. It keeps you wondering what is going on and I have to say that what happens at the end is totally unexpected. Willis and Jackson are perfect in their respective roles. The film starts with Willis chatting up a woman sitting next to him on a train and you could easily imagine you're actually watching another Die Hard sequel...however, immediately the direction of the film changes as you realise that Willis has become the sole survivor of a train crash. The plot takes unexpected twists and turns, indeed it is wholly unpredictable as to what happens next and therein lies the reason why this film is so captivating. You just don't know what to expect next!",Unbreakable
557,edinburghstoryteller,Hugely underrated and misunderstood movie,8,10 January 2006,"I love this film. I'm the only person I know who doesn't hate it, but I cannot fathom why it gets such a bad rap from everybody. It seems that Shyamalan's films have this a running theme - with the notable exception of the Sixth Sense, which pretty much everyone seems to get. He makes movies that are very subtle, and which seem to need you to focus on them just right to fully grasp what he was trying to do. I've enjoyed all his movies, but for me the alien part of Signs takes a lot away from what I believe to be the central storyline and as such the whole movie suffers a little. Yet I know other people who think Signs is his best, specifically because of the way the alien plot line accentuates the central one.Unbreakable is a beautifully simple film, but I think it has to hit you just right for you to completely get it. All the actors nail their parts, particularly Bruce Willis and his kid. Shyamalan takes an interesting (if slightly fringe) theory and puts it in a real world context, with a real family. Somehow he manages to never go overboard with it and - for me at least - it gripped me from the first moment to the last. Samuel L Jackson's character history is really nicely crafted in the middle of the other plot lines and you get genuinely involved in the people Shyamalan has created.Don't get caught up in all the talk of the twist ending. The ending is good, but if you spend the whole movie waiting for this tumultuous twist you'll inevitably be disappointed, and the movie stands alone without it. Don't go into this movie expecting another Sixth Sense or Signs. It's very very subtle and very understated. If you don't like slow movies, just don't watch this because it moves at a very sedate pace, but I personally think you'll be missing out. You'll likely either love it or you'll loathe it, but at least it will make an impression.",Unbreakable
558,Mourn-2,Unthinkable,1,11 December 2000,"Well, this is the 328th review on IMDB, so I'm probably not going to say anything that hasn't been said yet.I will just say that, more than any other movie I can think of, I am absolutely shocked that this movie has a 7.7 rating and ANY positive reviews at all.  In my opinion, this is indicative of the fact the movie going public no longer understands what makes a good film or even recognizes one when they see it.  Unbreakable was an attempt at a two hour character study, primarily of two men.  I'm guessing it was meant to be a character study because there isn't a plot or story line to speak of.  This is fine, character studies can be interesting, unfortunately we are spoon fed little pieces of information in one scene, and then shown the effect of it in the very next, as if we were being spoon fed the dimensions of the characters. 
For all the benefit of the doubt M. Night Shyamalan gave his audience in The Sixth Sense, he treats them like complete idiots in Unbreakable, making sure he drops a small foreshadowing to the audience before hitting them over the head with the actual event to make sure they understood.  And even with this heavy handed approach, we ultimately end up with two people we don't care about swimming around in a thin story based on the incredible assumption that someone wouldn't realize that they had never been sick or injured in their entire life until it was pointed out to them.  In fact, the entire foundation of premises this movie is built upon is so fanciful and preposterous, that even a reasonable suspension of disbelief is impossible.  Lastly, the camera work, particularly the artsy shots, should LEND to the storytelling, not take away from it.  Every time Shyamalan indulges in one of these sequences, he is not highlighting something important, he is reminding us we are only watching a movie.  What he did so skillfully in The Sixth Sense comes across as random and forced in Unbreakable.  Top this off with one of the most ridiculous scenes ever put on film in a serious movie (those who have seen it will probably know what I am talking about, those who don't heed my warning and go see it anyway, just watch for the scene with the kid and the gun), and you have a self-indulgent pile of trash unworthy of even going straight to video.  I don't know if Shyamalan was rushed to get this out, or if he got Kevin Costner syndrome after the success of his first movie and decided that he could mail one in, but Unbreakable is Unthinkably bad.  At the very very least, do yourself a favor and catch it for free on HBO or Showtime, or spend a buck and watch it in the dollar theatres, where it will be very soon I hope, making room for something more palatable.",Unbreakable
559,LynneSin,"Yikes, I actually sat through this stinker",2,2 December 2000,"This movie was just a horrible movie and I found absolutely no redeeming qualities in it whatsoever.  The only reason I sat through the entire movie was to find out what the ""big deal"" was at the end of the movie.  And it just wasn't worth it.The director tried to hard to recapture the magic that he and Willis created with ""The Sixth Sense"" and tried just too dang hard.  There was too much Hitchcock/Welles type camera tricks that just got old way too quickly.  And throughout the whole movie the cast spoke so slow and sullenly that I found myself dozing off throughout the movie.And the kid in the movie, well, he wasn't any Haley Joel Osment.  I'm really hoping that M. Night S's next movie will be a big improvement.  I'd recommend if you really need to see this movie to wait for the video to come out.  That way you can pause throughout the movie and take a nap.",Unbreakable
560,butchM,Piece of C**p,1,30 April 2001,This movie is so bad it is unbelievable.  Bruce Willis goes for subtle - which means all he does in this film is whisper.

561,RJC-4,The sorrow and the pity,8,12 January 2001,"One mighty branch of the horror tree has always derived its power from sympathy.  From Whale to Polanski, the masters grounded their best work in pathos: the monster more human than the people, the tenant in the wrong building.  The way was lost in Hollywood during the 1970s and 1980s, when a succession of formula films sent horror off to summer camp.  For two decades, American audiences were taught that horror is only the game of murdering banal teenagers -- a culture's revenge on its own emptiness, maybe.Shyamalan is a savior of the sub-genre of compassionate horror, at least as it is practiced here.  His ""Sixth Sense"" was a small revelation, a notice that the poetry is *still* in the pity.""Unbreakable"" is possibly even better.  About the surface, there's no doubt it's lovely.  Underneath, however, is where the action is.  The theme of the outsider is handled superbly, but what grabbed me most was his treatment of the burdens of duty, justice, honesty, fragility (both in the emotional sense and, as the title implies, a peculiar, creepy physical one), and, everywhere, the redemptive possibilities of love.  Then there is a very cool homage to comic books.  All this and it will unnerve the hell out of you, too: for even more than in the ""Sixth Sense,"" Shyamalan has smuggled into a mainstream film imagery and texture usually found in the work of exiled directors like Lynch and Gilliam.It bears mentioning that, along with Gilliam, Shyamalan is the best thing to happen to the mid-life career of Bruce Willis, who keeps revealing depths that were invisible before.  Will there be more collaboration?",Unbreakable
562,Lord_Fug,"Often excellent, mostly good...",7,1 January 2001,"MAYBE SPOILERS! ABOUT THE SIXTH SENSE THOUGH NOT THIS FILM!!OK, lets set the scene, just so you know I enjoy the Sixth Sense as a film, when I first saw it the twist blew me away.  However, once I thought about it, I decided it didn't really work, here's a guy that's been living out his life for some unknown amount of time (although I think its fair to assume its probably a few months or so) without anyone saying a word to him, without human touch and generally walking about finding locked doors and silence in his path.  I don't think the end worked because surely he would have sensed something was wrong and wouldn't have been the calm character he actually was.  So now you know my taste in Syamalan...But anyway, this review is about Unbreakable, which, in short I did like, but I found to be very flawed.  The beginning bored me to death, but then came Samuel L. and all was well :)  He was great as ever in this movie, filling each scene he was in with his uncanny ability to hold the screen on his (brittle) shoulders.  But while this film did have its superb moments (when Willis stands in the train station in his raincoat was a stand out moment for me) mostly it seemed to be too much of good ideas wasted.  But, as I said, I enjoyed the film despite its lack of depth and unfortunately lethargic pace.But I would recommend seeing it, the twist at the end of this outing is a pretty good one, even if I did guess it before the end...but at least this time it made sense :)I gave the film 7/10 in IMDB, because it had a nice sense of humour and a good sense of reality, even if some of its handling of the superhero methodology was a little too comic book for the real life setting.",Unbreakable
563,Sean_Thorniley,Examining the Icon of the Hero,8,25 November 2000,"M. Night Shyamalan has again created a wonderful film that is unique and surprising.  Pacing is something Shyamalan pays a lot of attention to and it pays off here just as it did in Sixth Sense.  The story is well thought out with wonderful touches of social commentary that are anything, but preachy.The cinematography and camera work are superb and well matched by the sound design and editing.  The costumes are perfectly real while still putting the characters into the look necessary to represent their place in the heroic cycle that this film represents.  The drama is real, be it harsh, funny, or thought provoking. A great examination of what is a hero.I would say that this film is very in the tradition of Hitchcock; it has a man who doesn't want to be a hero becoming the hero, this man must face things within himself that he doesn't want to, a woman/love is his primary weakness and the thrills come from the pacing and drama that creates the tension we all know and love. The action and music are the spices!Enough about the more technical stuff.  This is the best comic book movie ever made because it concentrates on the subject of the Hero as Icon and explains why comics have had the power they have always had.  Comics are very much like movies an let us hope the audience realizes this by the end of the film. The power of words and pictures (or no words at all) is astounding and if you don't think this is true then you need to think about this idea a good deal more.  This film many well be as misunderstood as the medium of comics, but it will help many see them a little bite differently.The best thing though, is this was still a fun film with good suspense and action for those who need either, or.The acting was top notch as we expect from the primary actors with Samuel L. Jackson showing us again why he is ""the man"", or one ""Bad Mother----"". Willis is once again the super hero he is nearly always cast as, but never so blatantly. This film would not be what it is without these two actors. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark also wonderfully accent them leads and their themes.A must see for folks who just love film, who love comics, or who love good father and son flicks.",Unbreakable

Mr. Sham-I-am took what could have been a somewhat interesting theme (a real life super hero), and dumbed it down to the point that I felt like I had been injected with a lethal dose of duuuh drug. Just a few questions that came up in my mind as the film unfolded/unravelled that I guess I was just expected to ignore: -Who realises only in their 40s that they have never been sick in their whole life? -Who has to go bench some weights to realise that they have super-human strength? -Who only starts realising they can sense criminals after somebody points it out to them? -If your son pointed a gun at you to prove that you were a superhero, would you say that you were going to be very angry and then just forget about it after and go out for a drink? -Why did I have to predict 5 mins in advance that he was going to fall in the water when he did his first hero job? -Why does the Samuel L. Jackson character only reveal his evilness to our hero when they shook hands at the end? -Was Bruce Willis acting, or just sleepwalking?-Why does this have a 7.2 rating?

An exercise in ULTIMATE patience, which even the Dalai Lama would ultimately fail.The movie starts off with the birth of a baby boy named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) but taking a closer look at him his arms and legs are broken for some reason, and through out life he gets the name Mr. Glass because he breaks easily. Fast forwarding to the present an unhappy married security guard named David (Bruce Willis) discovers that he is the sole survivor in a train crash and surprised he doesn't have a scratch on him, but when Elijah discovers David he is drawn to him, whilst David doesn't seem to be interested in what he is capable of.

I didn't begin to write this review/opinion piece just to bring down the movie's rating but to inform the level-headed individuals of the world, as to how much of a steaming pile of elderly woman's turd UNBREAKABLE genuinely is.Its a total excremental mess from the get go.

571,EdMatt13,Refreshing take on the comic book genre,7,4 June 2021,"Let me preface this by saying that I have not seen the follow up films so some points I make may not have as much merit as if I had seen the others; however this film stands up on its own incredibly well. As a long time comic book fan I really appreciated the integrity and research that went into making this film a loyal love letter to the art form.Bruce Willis gives a great performance as David Dunn however the true standout performance of this movie comes from Samuel L Jackson as Elijah Price, who toes the line between thoughtful and honest and silently manipulative so well I was constantly on the edge of my seat trying to figure out his real motives.My one true gripe is that the movie does end quite abruptly; meaning it can be difficult to see David's character change over the course of the movie as it feels as though it ends just as it should be beginning- however I am aware of the sequels that exist and I believe that they may continue the story appropriately. I just have to find the time to watch them now!The sharp end does shake up the traditional action movie plot in a way that does not feel overly underdeveloped in its world or story, meaning that this film is a nice deviation from the average action flick- and yes, it did come out 21 years ago now, before the sudden influx of marvel movies- however age has not wearied it and I can especially recommend it in amongst the action movies of today.",Unbreakable

I left the theater completely awed and speechless, yet wanting to say soooo much about the plot, the characters, the haunting cinematography, brilliant use of costuming and perspective, and the fresh, inventive direction.
M. Night Shyamalan has proven himself as a top-notch writer, director and producer with The Sixth Sense. However, w/ Unbreakable, he exceeds even himself with this somber, subtle and methodical film. He has been criticized for his slow-pacing. Instead, he should be heralded for bringing back substance to the cinema. Not since Hitchock, has there been a better psychological director. And just like Hitch, his direction is not just for visual effect, but to inflect mood, character and storyline with a mere camera angle. Although what the audience sees via his inventive camera angles tugs and nudges the audience's psyche, the real brilliance lies in his ability to direct his actors.Bruce Willis has been criticized for 'not acting' in this movie. On the contrary, his subtlety and humanity was right on the money. So little was said, but so much was conveyed. But not all kudos goes to Willis and Shyamalan. The supporting cast is excellent. You know that something's not right w/ Samuel L. Jackson's sympathetic, yet slighty askew character; but you just don't know what until the truth is revealed. Robin Wright was excellent as a confused mother and heart-broken wife.  Spencer Treat Clark was engaging as the dutiful son looking for any excuse to worship a father that doesn't understand himself, much less his family.Well-paced, beautifully directed and strongly acted, Unbreakable is a sign of hope for the fate of cinema; that movies don't have to be predictable, over-the-top, or based on yet-another British literary classic to have substance, integrity and fine performances.Unbreakable proves that the coasters aren't the only thrill rides at the carnival.(But if you still insist on the coaster, just look for the ""Signs""!)",Unbreakable

Although the only thing funny about it is the amount of suckers like me who went to watch it. Again, dull rubbish for a couple of hours, uninteresting and fatally flawed twist fails to redeem this.The single point that Bruce Willis's character would be ssssooooo stupid to not release that he had all this special powers, such as super human strength until so one told him, when he was at least 30 yrs old seems so ridicolous in its self. (p.s. if this is a spoiler, then maybe you will not waste time and money watching this). I would be prepared to dislike this film on this alone.

It keeps you interested in the plot from the beginning to the surprising ending, which I thought was kinda flat but besides that this was a favorite of mine and probably the best I've seen for awhile!!  Bruce Willis continues to impress me and that's why he's a favorite actor of mine!!! Even though he plays very quiet he does such a terrific job!!  And I got something to say to those heartless movie critics out there!!  BRUCE WILLIS CAN ACT SO SHUT UP ABOUT HIM BEING SUCH A BAD ACTOR BECAUSE HE""S NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you wanna see him do his best acting here's a list of his movies that he proves to be an actor.  This movie of course, The Sixth Sense, The Story of Us, The Kid, Breakfast of Champions (even though the movie sucked!!), Death Becomes Her,  In Country, The Whole Nine Yards, and the Die Hard movies. Now back to the movie.  This movie seemed like something that I always wanted to see but I never thought about it.  I am a big fan of superhero movies but this was a very realistic one.  Just like M. Night Shayamalan made people feel in The Sixth Sense about ghosts possibly being real he made the people think that there could be real life superheroes in the world!!  I mean the scene where Bruce Willis is fighting that kidnapper/murderer was so realistic that it took my breath away.  It was so nicely done and really made you feel good about Bruce Willis's character because he had a gift in him.  Samuel L. Jackson did pretty damn good too being a character that he rarely becomes and that's a quiet man!  He's always running his mouth and giving smartass remarks like he did in Shaft, Pulp Fiction, and Die Hard With a Vengence but in Unbreakable he's not even close to that.  This was an awesome movie and one of my favorites from Bruce Willis!!  I recommand this movie to anyone who gets seduced to wonderful storytelling!!!",Unbreakable
579,simpeton,"Either You Get It, or You Don't",10,7 August 2001,"The way to think about this movie as you are watching it, is to imagine it as a comic book brought to film.  Not like X-Men or even Superman, where it's all action with little attention to detail or story.  It's hard for people who don't read comics and look down on them in general to believe, but there ARE a lot of comic books out there that are more cerebral than any book or novel they ever read.  This is THAT type of comic.Yes, a few of the plot points are far fetched, but that's the way it is with a comic book, or even a novel.  It's called ""suspension of disbelief"" and it means that you just accept the story and don't nitpick every minor detail. If you can't do that, then you will never enjoy ANY work of fiction, no matter how High Brow.  ""How could it work out that the two main characters just happen to live in the same city?""  ""How did Elijah's physical therapist just happen to be David's wife?""  Because it is a story and it works out better for the story if those things happen that way.The other thing I see most people questioning is this ""How could he have never been sick, never been injured, and not know it?""That one actually has a very simple psychological answer that has nothing to do with fiction.  It's called repression of the past.  Your mind is an amazing thing.  It can have all kinds of knowledge stored up inside it, that you don't access because a decision is made by you subconsciously that you DON""T want to know, or remember.  Have you ever met someone who was sexually abused as a child, but didn't even know it until they were thirty?  I have. It's because on some level their mind decided they could either have that in their head all the time, or the knowledge of the abuse could be pushed to a back corner of the mind, never to be thought of again.  It happens all the time.Bruce Willis' character repeats throughout the movie ""I'm just a regular guy.  I'm just a regular guy.""  That's the same thing his mind has been repeating all these years, convincing him he was normal until he had no knowledge of the fact that he wasn't.  The more Elijah made him see the truth, the more David was trying to convince himself other wise.  He wanted a normal life.  He wanted to be with his girlfriend for the rest of his life.  And so his mind cut off any knowledge he might have had of his true nature.  It made him blind to the fact that he had never been sick.  It made him blind to the fact that he had never been hurt.  It is even hinted at in the flashback sequence that the decision to fake the injury after the accident was made subconsciously.The bottom line about this movie is: either you get it, or you don't.  You don't have to be well versed in comic books to enjoy this movie.  But you do have to be able take in all the details.  There are NO insignificant details in this movie.  Everything that is said or done is done for a reason, and leads to something else later in the movie.  If you don't have the temperament to be able to take it all in, you won't understand or like this movie.",Unbreakable
580,Chessack,"An interesting premise, but missing something.",6,26 June 2001,"This movie has a very interesting beginning: a man (Bruce Willis) survives a train wreck without a scratch. It turns out there are other curiosities about this man, and we get caught up in a mystery that takes some unexpected turns. Where the mystery ends up, I won't reveal, since that would spoil the plot -- I will say that it ends up in a very interesting place.
However, that said, I have a number of problems with the execution of the movie. First of all, I didn't care for the directing style at all. Many of the scenes felt needlessly ""gimmicked"" or ""obfuscated."" For instance, there was one scene where two characters are sitting in front of a TV talking to each other. Instead of seeing the characters directly, we see their reflections in the TV screen. I'm sure there's an artistic explanation for why he did that, but it felt goofy and pretentious to me -- like the director was trying too hard to do something ""different."" In another scene, we see about 60 seconds of activity through billowing curtains from outside the room. Most of what you see is the curtains, with only glimpses of what is going on inside. Again, I'm sure it appealed to the ""artistic"" crowd, but I found it annoying and artificial. I've always felt that true artistry should not call attention to itself -- you shouldn't notice it until you watch the film a second or even third time. So the director was too ""present"" in how the scene was played out.Second, and much worse, many of the scenes were lethargic and slow. Long pauses were taken between the actors' lines -- far longer than required for a dramatic pause, far to frequently. Things felt ""slow"" through the entire movie. It was interesting in terms of the overall plot line, but the many of the individual scenes were utterly boring. I saw this movie for the first time on DVD (not in the theater), and more than once I almost reached for the remote and hit the ""fast forward"" button. I will say, it was interesting enough that I didn't actually hit the button; but the fact that I eyed the remote at least 5 different times speaks volumes. If it were a truly riveting movie, I wouldn't have been able to tell you where the remote *was*.Finally, while I won't reveal the ending or what happens in the climax, I will say it felt like not enough happened. After the movie was over, I said out loud to myself, ""That's it?"" It felt incomplete to me. Not in the way that screams ""sequel,"" because things are wrapped up, but the way in which they were wrapped up felt too quick. The way the general plot was structured, if you had read a 1-page treatment of the movie, you'd have said, ""Wow! I bet this final scene will be packed with power and emotion."" While it was surprising, it was not powerful or emotional. It was rather slow and stale, which, sadly, is how the entire rest of the movie felt.Ultimately, Unbreakable was intellectually interesting, but emotionally empty. The performances were wooden. None of the characters really moved me or made me like them. It felt like everyone from the director to the actors to the cinematographer, could have used some caffeine or perhaps some energy bars -- the entire production lacked ""energy."" Unbreakable's probably worth seeing once, but if you don't see it, you haven't missed much -- and it's certainly not worth seeing more than once.My score: 6/10",Unbreakable
581,RomyNL,"Should we expect ""The 6th Sense - 3""???",5,9 December 2000,"Well...I am just back from the movies, we saw a long-awaited 2nd film of that Indian-American prodigy-director and Mr. Willis, that has just opened this week-end in Moscow. My impressions? I thought the cloning was still out of law. So please stop Mr. Shayamalan from cloning his sudden success of the debut movie. What we see in ""Unbreakable""? First 1.5 hour there's only Bruce Willis whose acting is limited just to slow turns of his head and mysterious expression of his eyes. What's changed since the last movie?? Nothing, maybe his hair is now  a bit shorter. As for the plot...Well, after ""The Sixth Sense"" we all know that until the last 10-15 minutes you can easily go to the buffet and have another portion of popcorn without a risk to miss something important in the plot. Same with ""Unbreakable""..The action in this movie lasts only the lat10-15 minutes. And if you expect extraordinary final, I should disappoint you: Mr. Shayamalan put it all so clear black and white. As for the second star of the movie (Mr. S. Jackson), he is hopeless. Never saw such a plain and uninteresting acting. Ok guys, I will not put spoilers into my review. I will just give you a short advice: be ready for disappointments!",Unbreakable

The first time I saw it I had great expectations based on The Sixth Sense, but this is not that movie.  It doesn't have the depth of meaning that that movie had, but it is a marvelously crafted piece of film art nonetheless. At some point Shyamalan will have to get past the surprise endings, but nobody does them better than he does, not even the great Hitchcock, who Shyamalan obviously is emulating.  The cinematography here is also less fulfilling than that of the Sixth Sense, where Tak Fujimoto's work is transcendent from the very first frame to the last.  Here the cinematography is more workmanlike, but still up to the demands of the script.  It does drag at times, and the part for the young boy is not nearly as rich as Haley Joel's was, but M. Night is still fascinating to watch as he once again unwinds a totally original, completely absorbing tale.  The use of the mirrors and other reflective surfaces in relation to Samuel Jackson's character is worth a chapter in a book of film history alone.  See it, but see it at least twice!",Unbreakable

I had no trouble with the pacing of the film as it reflected the mood of the Bruce Willis character and was a good way to make you feel his pain and confusion. In my opinion this movie showed much more ambition and maturity than the Sixth Sense. I hope that this gifted director will keep making the movies he wants to and not be swayed by some bad reviews.,Unbreakable
584,harveyfan,BRUCE WILLIS IS SECURITY MAN,8,29 July 2002,"Bruce Willis is a superhero, he just doesn't know it. When he becomes the sole survivor of an apocalyptic train crash, he comes to the attention of Samuel L. Jackson (playing against type as an obsessed comic book nerd).This bewildering drama centering around Willis's reluctant quest for self-knowledge starts slowly and goes nowhere.

Besides that, the pacing requires patience and some of the developments bother me a little bit. For example, Mr. Glass affirms that David's weakness is water, but it is said that David survived five minutes underwater when he was a child. Sounds like a superpower to me, and therefore that subplot ends up feeling silly. And then, the twist that should mark the end of the second act and set up a climax... is the final scene of the movie. ""Unbreakable"" is all build-up, an origin story with no pay-off.",Unbreakable

589,tonylo,Much too long to get around to nothing,4,25 November 2000,"This movie was a disappointment because it had so many possibilities that did not turn out. The hero, David Dunn was poorly developed. He appeared bored with life both before and after his epiphany. The parallels between him and his counterpart, Elijah, were never drawn. His backstory was poorly told. And finally, his son was just a two dimension.Many reviewers compared this to the director's fabulous Sixth Sense, but there really is no comparison. This movie was edited to death and not where it should have been. The bulk of the movie dealt with his dreary present and not enough with his past or future.The ending was terrible. Any movie that fills out the ending with titles explaining what happened to the characters after the action finished is poorly done.The movie should have ended at the breakfast table after much more action on the part of the 'new' David Dunn.All in all this movie took too long to deliver too little.",Unbreakable
590,RyeOfTheDead,an underappreciated subtle work,10,17 July 2001,"Let me just say first and foremost, that I understand that I am going out on a limb here and expressing an opinion that from what I have heard, I am the only person in america (or at least on the east coast, because one person in Seattle told me she agrees) But I really liked Unbreakable. GASP! what's that? Yes! I sat through this movie that everyone told me was terrible, and I thought it was fricken awesome.  That's right, fricken awesome.  Not just awesome, fricken awesome.  I loved it.  It think M. Night Shyamabatayaharawalan really captured the essence of a comic-book character in real life.  Samuel L. Jackson never ceases to amaze me.  Can I just say that? I mean he is one of the most versatile actors of today.  From the badasses he plays in movies like Pulp Fiction and Shaft, to the quiet wiseman characters like Mace Windu.  And here in Unbreakable, as Elijah Price... he plays a man who is a little of both.  Elijah is not a loud man, at all.  He is not a strong man, and yet, he is tough.  In my opinion, Elijah the character almost speaks more of the Unbreakable title, than the David character.  For while David's body can't be broken, his spirit has.  But Elijah's is undying.  And neither, I think, is Samuel L. Jackson's talent. Bruce Willis, is sort of a joke to most critics I think. Which is understandable.  Someone who got famous by yelling ""Yippie Kai Yay motherf***er"" is not exactly something that gets you respect.  But for the Sixth Sense, and this movie, I think he has earned some.  Except for one scene, this is not a movie for Willis to flex his physical muscles, but the mental ones.  His David is a man who doesn't want to admit to himself the truth about his life.  He knows, all along, that it is true. but he won't allow it to be.  We see so much more of the mental actor that Willis can be, having caught a glimpse of that in the famous ending of the Sixth Sense.One last thing I wish to touch on, is Spencer Treat Clark (why do child actors always have all three names?) Spencer plays the part of David's son, Joseph.  I just want to say that I think Spencer is a talented child actor. It is a shame that hollywood has a bad habit of picking one child star they like for a while and gives all the parts to them (Currently it's Haley Joel Osment) instead of developing a talent pool of young stars, and helping them to hone their craft as they grow older.  Spencer is a talented young actor, I admired his work in both this film and in Arlington Road.  And yet I doubt anyone knows his name, or they jokingly refer to him as if he were the Poor Man's Haley Joel. This attitude is terrible for talented young actors like Spencer, and I don't think it's any better for the beloved ones like Haley Joel Osment.   If you disagree with me that it's not a problem to only have one big child star at a time, look at a young woman by the name of Drew Barrymore.",Unbreakable
591,afcn,"overrated, yet recommendable",6,6 January 2001,"A movie I have mixed feelings about. First of all, it might be a bit overrated. Yet I cannot say that I disliked it. Shyamalan proves his skills for sure.Lets take the train ride at the beginning for example: the camera - camera perspectives in general were mostly impressive - moving to get a glance at the characters though the gap between the seats. And as more bridges the train passes as more threatening they get; until a point is reached were everybody is aware that something is about to happen.As I am not keen on comics the story itself didn't appeal to me, but I like the way it is told. The characters are not flat and the casting is well done. The atmosphere is just right and the film is rather calm.Probably some will be disappointed by the lack of action, as violence is not directly shown.I usually don't like surprise endings, but it would have lost its effect if the audience had known it in the first place. It could be worth seeing it a second.",Unbreakable
592,itsclear,break out into laughter?,10,19 December 2000,"I loved this movie.First off, the movie moves slow and it's something I don't mind because it leaves you wondering if what is being suggested is true.  And throughout the movie there are certain clues and suggestions being made.  Like the colors purple and green, Samuel L. Jackson's slightly off normal view of the world, not to mention his off normal hair-do.  They don't tell you everything and leave stuff for you to figure out and I think that's great!  And for the surprise ending, everything comes together in a disturbing way.Second, the movie's greatest scene is when he realizes who he is and what he should do.  He's a security guard and that was a personal decision.  Watch this movie and watch these scenes... And in the end, we have a really deep movie.  We realize that there are no unbreakable men, or none that we know of.  The movie ask us to keep an open mind.  I watched it in a packed theater and people laughed at the idea of there being an unbreakable man.  And I hated that they laughed but, it was understandable because it's something so unbelievable and off normal.  But then it's not funny at all because we have people like the Samuel L. Jackson character, people like the guy who asked to look at someone's house... and it's really scary.Perhaps I loved this movie because there's a hero that really doesn't exist in the real world... only in the comics.  But if there is one out there in this real real world, I'd keep an open mind about it.",Unbreakable
593,Robin_Hood,Great movie.,8,30 December 2000,"Shyamalan clearly has a gift.  It's not that he can see dead people.  It's not that he is seemingly 'unbreakable'.  It is, however, a fantastic writing ability.  'The Sixth Sense' was indeed a great movie and contained possibly the greatest over the last ten years.  However 'Unbreakable', which is described as it's sequel, has an equally excellent ending.  Without giving too much away, it simply leaves you open mouthed and shell shocked (the words ""no way!"" will probably seep into your mind.There are several similarities between the two.  The soundtrack, camera techniques, even the slow moving Bruce Willis, are almost exact in both of them, which is by no means, a criticism.  Samuel L Jackson is purely marvelous as 'Mr Glass' and provides a perfect backdrop to Bruce Willis' soul searching character, with his 'expertise' role.  I found that both actors relate so perfectly on screen, the idea of a sequel has now become a 'must'.The one problem with this film is that the ending left me amazed by the twist, but I expected something more.  I sat throughout the movie searching desperately for a clue to what the finale might hold and yet a found very little.  However having heard and seen the twist I was disappointed to see the film end so suddenly.  The chance for a sequel has been left wide open due to the fact that the film doesn't really finish!  Basically, the twist is revealed and the film ends.  I was expecting something like in the Sixth Sense, life after the twist.Despite this the film is well worth watching, with breath taking performances from both Willis and Jackson, although personally...Jackson gets the nod everytime as the better.  8/10.  Not all I hoped it would be, but worth waiting for.",Unbreakable

Unbreakable does exactly that. The theme is simple - if there is good, there is evil....if there is strong, there is weak....if there is intelligent, there is insane....that is how the world is...that is how it WILL be..and that is exactly what we must understand as humans, and choose our path accordingly.

597,eleanorrigby099,Cool,10,2 February 2019,"My kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for proving the consistency of his moviemaking abilities. ""Unbreakable"" is a movie that is rich in both technical brilliance as well as script quality.First, let me get my one objection for the movie off my chest. The ending could have been done better. The majority of the length of ""Unbreakable"" does an excellent job of building suspense, with the wonderfully muted, melancholy acting adding depth and tension to the plot. My problem is that it fails to live up to its own expectations; the ending does not consummate entirely what I expected it to. Somehow, in a movie that took painstaking details to illustrate every step and glance, concluding it in the manner that it did felt almost blasphemous. Maybe in a nameless action thriller it could be passed off as mere hackery. But here, it seems strangely out of place, kind of an enigma in itself...Now that the ugly part is over with, I feel almost obligated to sing the praises of ""Unbreakable"". Shyamalan's prowess with photographic techniques and processes shows through in this, with rich reds and blacks given to scenes of moist emotion and colder colors dedicated to the bleak, uncaring (uncared for?) world. One technique I particularly liked was the manipulation of photographic mediums, some parts using crisp 35mm films and others using angry, shuttered magnetic (or 16mm?) film. In the end, it all worked very well, because each technique seemed to integrate seamlessly with the plot and mood (notice the confusion and panic at the very end?) ""Traffic"" is a good example of processing overdose. ""Unbreakable"", on the other hand, hones it perfectly. The lushness of this movie comes in close second to the wonderful eye candy of ""American Beauty"". I could watch it again easily... with the sound turned off!On the more human side of the spectrum, the acting was wonderful. How nice it is to see Bruce Willis proving himself to be a true A-class actor! His unassuming and insecure behavior worked *perfectly* for this role. Samuel L. Jackson, like always, did a bang-up job with what the script gave him. Robin Wright and Spencer Clark's characters seemed a bit two dimensional, but they seemed to be minor roles compared to the prominence of Willis and Jackson's characters. A little character development would have been appreciated, but if the ending was a result of the time-constraint guillotine, then I would expect the developmental scenes to have gone too.The thing that people seem to complain most about this movie is the plot. I like the premise. A little fantasy in our movies isn't such a bad thing once in a while, is it?",Unbreakable

600,Jonas-4,An intriguing movie.,8,28 June 2001,"M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is an intriguing movie in nearly every aspect.  That is not to say that it is a good movie in every aspect.My main problem with the film is that too often Shyamalan used ""interesting"" camera angles.  Whether or not they added something to the film is arguable, but they were certainly distracting.  One part that comes to mind is when an entire scene is viewed through the reflection off a TV.  When watching the scene I was no longer paying attention to what the characters were saying. Instead I was just wondering why in the hell Shyamalan decided to use that shot.  Anything that distracts a viewer from a film like that cannot be good.The only other complaint I have with the movie is the lack of life in it. All the actors are directed to act troubled, however in doing so Bruce Willis comes across as disturbed.  Since I cannot see inside the heads of the characters I am left feeling alienated as these characters deal with their issues inside their own minds.  And yes, the movie is slowly paced.  I never lost interest, but I can see how someone with a shorter attention span could do so very quickly with this movie.  The plot was stretched out just a bit too much.But perhaps I am being nit-picky.  I enjoyed Unbreakable overall.  It posed some interesting questions (are you taking the right path in life?; how many strange occurances can your mind dismiss?).  As for the twist at the end, I did not see it coming, and I thought it finished the movie wonderfully.And here comes the dreaded but inevitable comparisson to the Sixth Sense. Unbreakable was just too similar to Shyamalan's previous effort: both are slowly paced supernatural thrillers starring Bruce Willis with a thick, dark atmosphere and a huge swerve at the end.  The only positive part of that is that Like the Sixth Sense, I did not see the twist at the end coming, which means I was able to think back about everything I saw in the movie and slap myself on the forehead shouting, ""Doh, I'm an idiot!""For that feeling alone (a rarity in today's film world) this movie is worth seeing.

It does nothing, it says nothing, it goes nowhere...very, very slowly. After the excellent 'Sixth Sense' this is a very big disappointment. It's almost as though they thought 'Sixth Sense' was such a big success that they needed another idea immediately, to be made in the same style. And the style is very similar. Unfortunately, that, and the people it shares, is where the resemblance ends.We have all the ingredients here for a bad film. The leading man can't act (I am not a Willis fan, although he was right for the role in 'Sixth Sense'). Samuel L Jackson looks truly bizarre and comes across as just plain annoying. Although even he pales in comparison to the kid, who is truly irritating. And as for Dunn's (Willis's) wife, she's just a complete non-entity. Quite frankly, I didn't care enough about any of these characters to give a damn what happened to them. In addition, too many of the characters mumbled incoherently (especially the school nurse - what the hell was she saying?). There is just about enough plot to make a short, certainly not a feature film, and the director makes up for this with long drawn out and frankly tedious sequences (the opening sequence on the train was so long and boring that I knew it was going to be a poor film within minutes), frequent extended shots of characters' faces and weird camera angles. There was, to be honest, nothing to hold one's interest at all. Even the twist at the end provoked no more than very vague surprise. Very poor.",Unbreakable

Now I'm not expecting this to turn into a Superman movie part way through, but I would have liked to have seen a few heroic acts or, perhaps, a thrilling rescue (over and above what we do see) added to the mix.

However it could, quite easily, have fitted in to a 50 minute time slot for a 'Superman' type show. There was far too much time spent on slow-motion 'art' type shots, and far too many 'strange' shots (between train seats, through railings, on the orange juice are just some examples) that did nothing to ad to the film - they only served to p**s me off and put me to sleep. Willis and Jackson did admirable jobs in trying to make it flow faster, but they were on a doomed mission from the start because of the direction and photography. If it could have ended at the train-station where Willis is on the top of the steps then it might have been an almost decent film, but to drag it out for another half hour or so was pointless. (I also found it somewhat disturbing that someone was being choked to death to 'glorious' music - there did not appear to be anything wonderful about that!).Over all - if it was a debut film by an inexperienced director - it would have been a good attempt. But for a fourth film? I would say if you have two hours with nothing better to do (such as watching paint dry) it might be worthwhile seeing. Otherwise I suggest reading a comic :}",Unbreakable

Without spoiling anything for you, I'll just say that the movie should have, and very well could have, gone on for another half hour. Instead, the director wastes so much footage on things that people do not need to see. For example, at least a good minute is wasted on watching Bruce Willis pour orange juice. There's no dialogue, nothing going on central to the movie, just the pouring of orange juice. Again, until the ending it was a very good movie; If the director had just better juggled which scenes were neccessary and which weren't, and then used the extra film to actually give the viewers a conclusion, it would have been better.

The important stuff comes after he pours theglass, but viewers have to suffer through the wasted film anyway. Ithad a great plot synopsis, great acting, and a lot of originality. Butall this is thrown away by an unsufficient ending that leaves youwondering, ""I sat here all this time for THIS?""",Unbreakable
607,bilcal7-1,Personal Significance,9,17 August 2004,"It seems this movie has taken a bit of heat, known by many as Shyamalan's ""worst"" film. It is often written off as slow moving, and the twist at the end as unoriginal and boring. I've heard people say the acting and camera work was awkward and stale and that the casting was poor. Ironically enough, as more people begin to dislike this movie, the more I seem to fall in love with it. This film has a lot of personal bearing with me, both as a student of psychology and a lover of movies and just plain art. I feel like I've taken this film under my wing during its times of criticism, and now I'd like to try and show everyone what exactly I love about it so much. Shyamalan really showed a stroke of brilliance by getting Serra to be his cinematographer and to play around with the aestetics of the film. I don't know how or where Shyamalan is getting these guys for his movies, but I definitely love the style of each frame he shells out. Serra had been involved with predominately foreign films before Unbreakable. This was his first big American film, and I think you gotta give a little credit to Shyamalan for that. His unique and creative touch really added to the direction. In keeping with the ""comic book"" theme of the movie, you will notice that almost every shot is taken as if you are looking through or in between something. Like the squares of a comic strip. There is also a dark, slightly blue colored filter used throughout most of the film. This gives the movie a very bold, but eerie tone. Showing that the world can be a rough and scary place, but it can also be fought and overcome. It is evident that time and effort went into every shot. It may not slap many viewers in the face as brilliant, but it really strikes a chord with me. As for the score, I am more than willing to argue that this is, hands down, James Newton Howard's best score of his very successful career. It is compelling and booming. It's very powerful, but not over-the-top and excessive. For anyone with the soundtrack, check out 'The Orange Man' and 'Visions'. These are two of the most powerful pieces of any film score around. And I stress the word ""powerful"". Yeah, he's no Hermann or Morricone, but the emotional weight and emotive power of his chords and his overall composition are just downright chilling. The writing and the direction are just as captivating as the score. Almost every line of dialogue and every scene seems to be placed out on an island, alone so that everyone can stop and judge it. Some people might view this as cocky and/or boring direction, but I see it as daring and unique. Much of Shyamalan's writing is done that way. ('…I see dead people…' '...They call me Mr. Glass…' etc. etc.) Another aspect of the film that tickles my fancy is the underlying themes. I do believe, to a certain extent, that people do have somewhat supernatural powers at times. People have been known to make miracles and do unbelievable things. Maybe these things could be 'developed' in some way. These theories are, in a way, intertwined with some aspects of psychology, such as selective attention and self-actualization. If you care to discuss some of these ideas, let me know and I will relate them to the film through my eyes. In short, I do believe there is a superhero in everyone. It may not be through supernatural powers, but it may simply be through the act of reaching out to a person in need. Other themes of the movie, like how completely different people can always be connected in some way and how everyone has their vulnerabilities and weaknesses are intriguing, yet universal. From a psychological point of view, Shyamalan really gets inside the head of OI patients (osteogenesis imperfecta). He then brings this psyche to the next level with Jackson's character. Elijah, is very passionate but very tortured and evil. His interactions with Willis bring depth and focus to both the characters and the story. Certain scenes in the movie are really quite striking and powerful. The shots of Willis in his security poncho. The train station scene. Elijah's breathtaking fall on the stairs and many more speak so loudly to me and say so much in just a simple clip. For some reason this movie just speaks to me, like art. If anyone cares to discuss more about this film, that'd be cool. There is a lotta other cool stuff to talk about with this movie. Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it a few more times. It may not be the feel good film of the year, or the masterpiece that everyone was looking for, but it definitely sits well with me.",Unbreakable

In the movie, Bruce Willis wrestles with an unexplainable internal sadness until Samuel Jackson appears in his life. Samuel Jackson helps Bruce Willis awaken a gift within himself that was lying dormant for most of his life. I think the overall message of this movie is that no matter how old you get, it's never too late to realize your full potential or destined purpose in life. Everyone in this movie acted exceptionally well and there was never a dull moment. The ending could have been a little better but nevertheless, kudos again to a brilliant film!",Unbreakable

612,joejhrobinson,"Good acting, bad script",6,20 January 2019,"Unbreakable isn't a bad film. It's shot well, contains a couple of solid performances and has a very entertaining final act. However, it has several fundamental flaws, which really take away from the overall experience. Firstly, the script is very weak, being filled with exposition and just generally falling flat. This is particularly evident in the scenes where Samuel L Jackson's character, Mr Glass, is discussing comic-books. The script attempts to make them appear like some great art-form, but ends up making them sound ridiculous, as the characters over-analyse every panel. Some scenes come across as very out of place, namely the one where Bruce Willis' son threatens to shoot him to prove he has superpowers. It honestly feels wacky and unnecessary. For me, it feels like the script is trying desperately to imitate other movies, but never quite manages it, resulting in corny exposition delivered in an overly serious manner. I really wanted to enjoy this movie and, while I did to an extent, this flaw was difficult to get past.",Unbreakable
613,jon-88,The Seventh Sense,8,25 November 2000,"SPOILERS are contained in the following: The script was much weaker than the directing . The story fell apart in many places - and the payoff just didn't matter, and the heavyhandedness of the exposition added to the feeling that  the payoff wasn't worth it; what mattered was seeing the superhero come to terms with his gifts. The main issue is that the superhero's most valuable superpower isn't his being unbreakable, it's his own Extra Sense:  he sees guilty people.   This huge  additional power actually ruins the entire premise of the film - which is  that the evil genius is selecting for his opposite by creating situations where an unbreakable human emerges.   Nothing in the selection process would also select for someone with the superhero's additional ability. For me, this really destroys the film...  which is a shame, since the second power is   unnecessary for the story.  Why does this comic book character also need an extra sense?  Why not just have him be unbreakable, like many super-strong super heros?  (the Hulk, the Thing... etc) But having said that, it was fun to watch...  my favorite scenes were the funny ones, which in all cases involved the kid... best line:  ""I'll only shoot him once."" But too bad.  Night had a pretty good second idea - he just is still so fixated on his previous themes, that he couldn't let them go, and just let this movie do what *this* movie needed to do. Finally, did everyone notice the number of ""repeat"" scenes and themes from the Sixth Sense -  which get done differently here?  This really is a riff on the previous film.  You have the kitchen scene with the kid - you go from the terrible fear of the Sixth Sense, to the wonder and elation of Unbreakable. You have the disaffected wife dynamic - in the Sixth Sense there was no way back, here the relationship is unbreakable.  You have the sad man finding his true purpose, through the child.  You have the scenes in the basement, where a lot of the homework is done in that discovery.  You have a flashback to a different child, who was very fragile, which started the whole ball rolling.Don't get me wrong - it was fun too watch.  But too badthe plot of Unbreakable was so porous.",Unbreakable

There is hardly any emotion at all, Bruce and Sam walk around like Zombies. The ending is a HUGE let down! Here is a BETTER ENDING: Bruce and Sam are polar opposites of each other, hence they make one whole person together...right? So the weaker of the two, Sam, knows this and wants to be whole again, so he lures Bruce to a cliff top and then grabs him and jumps off the cliff with him. As they both impact the ground together they are both killed/transformed and become one normal person who simply walks away into the fog. Now that would have been a cool ending!",Unbreakable
616,mikecalla,"a consummate clinic in directing,etc.",9,16 July 2001,"M. Night Shyamalan seems to be proving himself quite the auteur. Unbreakable was the cinematic experience I had hoped it would be, especially after The Sixth Sense.  A quiet sense of wonder permeated each and every scene, accomplished with some of the finest cinematography I've seen in the last couple of years.  Director of Photography Eduardo Serra's execution is subtle, understated and absolutely beautiful.Cinematography legend Greg Toland of  Citizen Kane and The Grapes of Wrath fame would be proud of what this film accomplished artistically. I also couldn't help but notice all the long camera takes this film had, reminding me of a few Woody Allen films that let the actors act without the intrusion of the film making process, i.e.; getting a scene covered from multiple and sometimes meaningless camera angles just so the director and editor have something to work with in post production.  The characters seem at times to be acting for the benefit of the others on screen rather than ""us"", the audience, lending a quality of voyeurism to quite a few scenes.  The directors intent is quite clear to anyone wishing to delve a little bit deeper into the story and characters while appreciating how such a vision came to breath on film.With regards to the story, Mr. Shyamalan and his crew have constructed something so rich in visual texture while managing to keep the story subdued and character development full of deep-seated  anticipation.  Every plot point came perfectly without any extra connotations that usually creep into a story such as this (super heroes?).  Without any melodrama both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give very authentic performances that help the film keep its ""Any Town USA"" and ""Average Joe Six-pack"" feel very much alive.By virtue of ingenuity and most likely a meticulous preproduction period, Unbreakable manages to be a consummate clinic in directing, writing, acting, and cinematography.

618,rkcrawf-2,A more meaningful movie than the Sixth Sense,8,25 November 2000,"***Spoilers***I am in awe of people that did not like this movie or thought that it was worse than ""The Sixth Sense.""  I won't go into a comparison only because the movie stands on its on as a social commentary and a homage to comic books. It was well-done. The acting and cinematography were above expectations.To me, the most poignant point of the story was that everyone has skeletons. Examples: The train station scene where Dunne has to decide which evil to pursue. Dunne, being a less than ideal father. To put a ""hero"" in situations where he has to deal with major and minor evils was a welcome change from the standard ""get the bad guy"" plot.Second, as a former comic book fan, I wanted to kick myself for not seeing the twist. I think all who have seen it will admit subtle clues were present all along. As a side note, this movie has a lot in common with the ""Talented Mr. Ripley."" They both answer the question of how someone gets to the point where they wind up as a villian.My last heap of praise is admitedly on a subject I know little about. From the opening til close, the camera work was spell-binding. A full train-wreck scene would have spoiled the pacing. I found Robin Wright-Penn's character under-developed, but was impressed by the skill and emotion that she conveyed to us.My only real knock is the curt ending. It was not a long movie, so why not finish it up in the deliberate style that it started? As a mini-knock, Price's mother and Dunne's wife should have been used more.",Unbreakable

623,Diss,How I miss these type of movies,10,13 December 2001,"This movie is not perfect. And it has an ending which could have been better. But I've thought about it a lot, and I am satisfied with the ending. Apparently, many were not. How one could enjoy The Sixth Sense and not enjoy this movie is beyond me. I really enjoy a movie that doesn't rely on a lot of pointless violence, or pointless dialogue to tell a story. This movie is so refreshing to see after the onslaught of ""action packed"" movies I have seen the last 5 or 10 years. But perhaps the lack of good movies from hollywood recently has caused me to like this film more than I should. This may be the case. The movie is great, but falls short of a masterpiece. But it is still easily one of the top 5 films of 2000. If there were more good movies out of hollywood in the year 2000, I probably wouldn't think as much of this film. So I may be partially biased from watching too many bad movies.  The Acting was superb. His use of child actors in 2 movies (and it looks like more) is interesting and refreshing. They are used in a meaningful way, not just as plot devices. Willis paints a good picture of an every day guy. And Jackson portrayed his character perfectly- almost too perfectly. The camera work and editing was superb, no complaints at all. The scene with the swimming pool being the best example of this. The climax is perhaps one of the best sequences I've seen in a few years. No dialogue was necessary. The action was minimal yet effective and intense. While I suspect more people wanted more of this type of action, it doesn't belong in this movie. And then we come to the ending which I of course will not reveal. I am satisfied with it. Perhaps I, and many were disappointed that the ending is too perfect. We may have wanted something less clear. And the text at the end of the movie was unnecessary. This seems thrown in to appease people who like a movie ""wrapped up""As usual, I do not recommend this movie to people who only like movies with lots of action. But if you ""get"" movies like The Sixth Sense and Psycho, then you will ""get"" and enjoy this movie.",Unbreakable

I was laughing hysterically at Sam Jackson's character and the part where the kid pulls the gun on Bruce Willis..HAH! I can understand how people give this a good rating because it was done well in a technical sense...but like I said the story just is too ridiculous. I would have liked to see 'The Twilight Zone' do this in a half-hour segment..it might have been a thousand times better. If you want to see good film-making by all means rent 'Unbreakable'.

The concept initially seems interesting about a man who realises he has supernatural powers. Bruce Willis is pretty much sleepwalking through this film but then again he hasn't got an awful lot of real acting to do. As a big fan of SLJ as I am, his character here is somewhat absurd. There is one major twist at the end but it is so ridiculous you almost feel cheated.

626,engage2,Unbreakable Is Like The Matrix Without The Far-fetchedness,9,4 April 2006,"In a few ways this movie is reminiscent of The Matrix. Where David (Bruce Willis) discovers his ""potential"" through Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), similar to Neo and Morpheus. It likens us to the possibility that a ""sane man in an insane world"" could be an ""insane man in a sane world"" and vice versa.The story is about David, an ex-football star turned security guard with a wife and son who makes regular pay and wakes up every morning with an empty feeling. Elijah acknowledges this empty feeling to David as a sadness and then proceeds to tell him, ""...maybe its because you are not doing what you are supposed to be doing."" David feels burdened by Elijah's theories as evident in not only his skepticism, but as well, his downright defensiveness. Gradually, he begins to accept them however.By the time David comes to his realization, he rekindles the broken contact between him and Elijah, and, as you might guess, comes to understand what he must do. The movie now takes a turn in a very different direction, when David, as a regular man with a genetic edge discovered only by Elijah, must now conquer his doubts and fears over Elijah's theories and any concern he might have over whether or not his actions undermine his sanity, to enter what the audience has all been waiting for to see, superhero territory. Remember, this is the same guy who eats french toast for breakfast with a glass of Tropicana.The movie basically centers around Elijah's theory, which is about the closest link between the superhero world of comic books and ours. We see the burdens David faces when he has to reconcile everything he knows about his basis in real life with that of Batman, Superman, Spiderman and other gods from the pages of panel-by-panel mythology. It makes us wonder about the possibility and explores the brightest and darkest aspects of the human psyche. This ""crossing over"" aspect I found very reminiscent of The Matrix but without the farfetchedness. Which is what drives this movie much more closer to home than The Matrix could ever be.The movie ends on a note that leaves us to imagine the future to come. We are forced to question what we believe to be good and evil.",Unbreakable

There is nothing I would change about it.  The writer M. Night Shamylan wrote it completly to my taste. I believed that it could have been more exciting in little action and suspense that it had, but otherwise I felt that this is the perfect movie.",Unbreakable
628,Ryno_II,Possibly the best thriller I've seen!,10,4 May 2004,"This is a story that is emotional, dramatic and somewhat mind blowing.  It's rare where the viewer would feel inside the minds of the characters as much as in this movie.  M. Night Shyamylan proves to be a very worthy writer once again after his huge success with ""The Sixth Sense"". However I found Unbreakable to be much more entertaining.  It's not as far fetched as the ""The Sixth Sense"" and all the sides of the story seem to fit more and make more sense.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a large moneymaker but I can't quite figure why Unbreakable didn't do near as well.  Perhaps nobody wanted a very similar type of such an unusual movie with the same actor.
I recently just saw a director's cut of ""Unbreakable"" but I wouldn't recommend it.  There are scenes in it that add to the story but they also make it far fetched and too coincidental.  I'm glad these scenes were deleted, otherwise it would've been to over the top.",Unbreakable
629,Seller7861,A 7.1 rating is plain evil,10,9 November 2006,"This is a very good movie. People forget why and how story-tellers came into being. It was humanities first attempt to ""record"" history.This movie is profound in many ways. IMDb scares me more and more as I read the comments left for all movies. The intellectual quality of the reviews is a frigthening testament to the fact that those who lack humility the most, are also those who overrate their critical-thinking skills the most.This movie is vastly underrated. The references to the supernatural are less important than the ""natural"" elements. It is implied that David Dunn is created by the natural world, not the supernatural. His gifts can be explained scientifically. God did not single out David for invulnerability . . . nature did. David is a ""mistake"" in many of the ways that Elijah is a ""mistake"". Only Nature imbued David Dunn with the gifts necessary to make him the ""antidote"" to nature's ""Elijah-type"" mistakes.This movie opens the viewer to a fantastical, but not impossible idea to philosophically explain the origins of evil and righteousness. One of the most popular phrases in culture is ""good versus evil"". In reality ""good"" has no chance against ""evil"". The only force that can quell evil is righteousness. How this term has been changed into an epithet in modern American society is beyond me (the attachment to all things religious is a mistake put forth by those with political agendas), and that perversion of the term is very frightening. Righteousness is the extreme/pure version of ""good"". Evil is the extreme/pure version of ""bad"". Most people have forgotten that, or never learned it in the first place. This movie is also meant as inspiration. Reminding the viewer that those who put forth the idea that circumstance dictate outcomes fail to recognize the power of the individual to make choices for good or bad. Elijah doesn't have to choose evil. But the comics had an unintended side effect that his mother did not foresee. They convinced him that heroes are ""unbreakable"" while villains are easily ""breakable"". Elijah was intelligent, but self-pity; the inability to deal with ostracization; and immature childhood tormentors warped his intelligence and turned a ""good"" mind ""bad"". Elijah knows he's brilliant, but doesn't realize that being brilliant isn't enough. You must also build yourself a moral compass that works correctly.David Dunn was born with a working moral compass, but like Elijah, he felt out of place. Unlike Elijah, this feeling didn't make him irrationally angry, it made him sad. David wanted to ""find"" a place. Elijah decided to ""make"" himself a place. This bit of storytelling poetry hearkens back to the idea that ""good"" men conform to the world. ""Evil"" men make the world ""conform"" to them. (Think of people who do nothing but scream for change and constantly complain, without offering contrition or their own concessions to the world). This movie is excellent. The complaints I find for 2001 are found here. It's too slow. There are logical holes. Characters aren't charismatic enough. This visuals don't make sense to certain people. Some questions remain unanswered. Why attempt to turn fantastical ideas into reality? Etc.On the contrary this film does what few films do, it entertains and enlightens at the same time. It is inspirational. It is commentary (""David, we live in mediocre times""). It is speculation. It is fantasy with the real possibility of having roots in reality. There may be no action sequences like the ones audiences have come to expect. But that is because the movie remains true to its own credo: ""Being a hero isn't about stunts and self-glory, it's about helping ordinary people stay safe from self-aware evil."" This movie gets a 10.",Unbreakable
630,andy_krysiak,"Not Shyamalan's Best, but Good Nonetheless",8,4 May 2016,"In my personal opinion, M. Night Shyamalan has made one great film (The Sixth Sense), a whole lot of bad films, (The Last Airbender, After Earth, etc.) and then a few imperfect but strong movies (Signs, for example). Unbreakable fits into the last of these categories. While it is not as good as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable is an interesting movie that explores human nature and manages to be very entertaining. One could call this a comic book movie, as its story does revolve heavily around comic book films, but even if you were to call it that, it is a very light film at best. By that, I mean that, compared to other comic book movies, it does not rely on action. And in most ways, this surprisingly works very well as a concept in the movie.Bruce Willis does a great job in his role, and so does Samuel L. Jackson in his own respective role as well, but the development for these characters does at some times come off as a bit too forced, meaning they pushed the boundaries every once in a while to try and tell backstory for Willis's and Jackson's characters. It is a minor issue, but it is somewhat relevant to the story, so it needed to be mentioned.Shyamalan is known for having a twist ending at the end of most of his movies, and there is one here, but it is not as powerful a twist as one would expect after watching The Sixth Sense's fantastic twist. Of course, there didn't really need to be a twist at all in this movie, considering how light it is, and that the plot never really called for one. Nevertheless, the twist is pretty well-handled and serves as an overall satisfying conclusion to the movie,Unbreakable is an enjoyable, original film that is definitely worth a watch for fans of the thriller genre, despite not being as good as The Sixth Sense.Rating: B+",Unbreakable

I would have flashed back to Bruce Willis' character, as a child, being in a coma.  One which had been caused by his accident at a swimming pool.  The frequent hospital-bound Samuel L. Jackson's character (still a young boy) would be growing up using comic books as a crutch for handling his unfortunate physical reality.  Jackson would have read comic book stories to the Bruce Willis character.  Even though the Willis character is in a coma he would still have brain function.  Bruce Willis character would have used his imaginary to escape his reality.  We would learn that the entire plot of the movie was how Willis envisioned his life.  His wife would be the nurse who took care of him.  His amazing ability to be unbreakable would be his dream life.Such an ending would be grounded a bit more in reality thus becoming a bit more palatable.  You see, the mind is the most powerful part of the human body.  It can be unbending in it's ability.  It can create a more tolerable existance for one when the odds are against someone.  The mind gives one hope to carry on.  The mind gives one strength to carry on.  The mind is unbreakable.",Unbreakable

637,apoclypze0,quite a film,8,25 November 2000,"Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"", from what I've seen, has people divided on their opinions.  You'll either love it or hate it.  Well, as subjectively as possible -- I recognize the major flaws that lie within the film -- but I couldn't help but be entranced by its hypnotic powers.  I loved it.  Hell, the film is a knock-off of Shyamalan's previous ""The Sixth Sense"".  And it's cold and unconvincing at its core.  It's also really slow and plodding, and perhaps too subtle and understated for most.  But it doesn't matter to me. I loved its subtleties, its slow pace.  It really lingers in your head for days after you see it.  There are some seriously classic scenes within that were soooo well done and soooo effective.  The end may seem like a quick shock, a cheap trick to some -- I loved it.  I hope they don't make sequels to it like I've heard -- it ended on a perfect note.

The Sixth Sense's whole theme made you say, ""Gosh, I should have known!"".

639,jeida,The (payed) critics say: Unbearable.,5,6 December 2000,"I remember when I was very young, and playing in the back yard was what summers were made for.  But supper time spoiled everything.  My mother would call me in right when things were getting good with me and my friends.  You see, in order to pretend properly, things had to be believable, even for us kids.  It was no fun just saying, ""Okay!  I have special-op military training, so I kill you!.""  There had to be background, a semi-plausible explanation at least.  And just when we would decide on the ever important background for our pretend session, supper time inevitably hit like the power going out.This movie took it's time and successfully bullied a good explanation into place.  A lot of energy was spent on getting to know the lead character, and care was taken to ensure that the movie goer comfortably understood the theories and issues raised.  And just as it was time to move on to the heart of the adventure, mom called everyone in.  The movie ended.The Sixth Sense, by the same writer/director, and also starring Bruce Willis, will be closely compared to this film.  The biting, real feeling you may have experienced in The Sixth Sense is not what this movie seemed to be trying for.  A possible warp in reality perhaps.  There are many similarities, but no bite.  With that bite I may have viewed it as a seven out of ten movie, but I only give it a five, which to me means, ""It's okay, take it or leave it.""I don't feel like I wasted my time with this one.  Willis was worth watching in his dark hood and jacket, but I won't be thrusting the empty cassette sleeve from a rental store display into a friend's hands as a recommendation.

640,alvintostig,Breaking the Sophomore Jinx,7,1 January 2001,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" is a remarkably well constructed second film.  Following the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" he attempts a movie which, in some ways, echoes the first, and also goes a completely different route. 
One of the smartest moves comes in the first plate of the movie in which he states the statistics of the vast amounts of comic books sold, read, and written in the world.  This, coupled with a very well performed history course by Samuel L. Jackson in which he equates comics with ancient hieroglyphics, lends credence to the story.David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is an untouchable person.  Without spoiling to much of the movie, his charachter is believed to be, by the Jackson character, a modern day superhero.  In the hands of another director, this film would have been made into a much more special effects, run of the mill superhero flick.  In Shyamalan's hands however, he paces the film in such a way that lends not only credence but also provokes thought.  Acting performances that never step wrong and very inventive camera setups make this film extraordinarily beautiful and engaging.Some have said that the ending of the movie cheats, allowing for a tidy wrap up of the plot.  I believe, however that the ending puts the final cap on the characterization of the roles of the superhero and villain, which, in retrospect, is what the movie is about anyway.While watching this film, I was struck by the thought that, in the first two films of M. Night Shyamalan, he seems to be lending a new ear and a new aspect of the psychological horror movie, realizing that the slasher film is over done.  There was another great director that realized the horror of the mind was scarier than the horror of the eye.  His name was Alfred Hitchcock.",Unbreakable
641,bcorse,Not the movie you expected,9,2 September 2002,"I really liked this movie, which I consider much better than ""Sixth Sense"". I believe that the problems many people say they have with ""Unbreakable"" come from their own expectations.  I expect similar reactions to Shyamalan's latest ""Signs"", because he is a director that refuses to respond to people's perceptions of him or his work.Here's the 411: this move is NOT a clone of ""Sixth Sense"", despite what several reviewers have said; and it is not about ""comic books"" as such. Like ""Signs"", it's a story about discovering the strengths (and weaknesses) within yourself and learning to deal with them.I've always admired writers and directors who can combine the everyday with the ""unreal"" and make it work, and that is Shyamalan's greatest strength in both areas.  His own love of comics comes through here, and that famous Stan Lee line ""With great power comes great responsibility"" underlies nearly every scene in this movie, although it is never voiced out loud.  What makes this work is that the Bruce Willis character, much like Peter Parker, is an everyday guy who has problems in his life, some of which are of his own making.  The joy of this movie is in watching Willis's security guard character put aside his own reluctance and come to grips with the truths of who he is, and what is really important to him.  Like Mel Gibson's character in ""Signs"", Willis's ""hero"" realizes that his wife and child must be his first priority, but he must not ignore his unique calling.Samuel L. Jackson is a wonder to watch.  It is his character that drives the action throughout the movie, and a more formidable ""Lex Luthor"" type you won't find anywhere, in film or in comic books.  The ""twist"" at the end, where his full role in events is finally revealed, is more of a ""wrench"" that some viewers just won't be able to absorb.  For those who can, you'll want to watch this movie over and over again.The DVD contains some interesting deleted scenes with personal narration by Shyamalan explaining why they were filmed, and why they were finally cut. I found this to be a very nice view into the mind of a talented filmmaker who has yet to hit his peak.",Unbreakable

Both endings are pretty predictable though.I guess the thing that really bugged me about this movie is that it felt like it spent the entire movie building up the two characters and you see how truly amazing Willis's character is.  Then, at the end, Willis's character finds out that his mentor if you will, is the one that has been causing all of these horrible accidents just to find him.

646,osvazas,it was a pure masterpiece ...,10,10 January 2010,"I could describe this film as a mixture of fantasy/imaginary world and realistic and grounded masterpiece... I like the whole atmosphere of this film, the environment, which is very melancholic and sad. Sad, because it was made in a a very slow pace, there is no rush. Everything unfolds gradually, every single scene is elaborated and scrutinized. I disagree, that it is some sort of fiction, where we can face one more super-hero with subnormal powers, No! It is about simple family, about simple man with daily problems, who happens to be something extraordinarily special and having ability to be invulnerable, which in turn, makes him a protector of humanity. I do agree, it might sound little bid cliché, but yet everything was conveyed and represented in a totally different way of what we normally see in these types of movies...

The main character, David, is experiencing family problems, along with personal problems. After a train accident kills all passengers, except him, he starts to really question the point of his existence with the help of an odd man – Elijah Price. I did enjoy this movie, but I've grown quite biased towards M Knight's movies because he's a different sort of director.

651,LL-9,Unbreakable Breaks Down (Possible Spoiler),4,3 January 2001,"(Possible Spoiler! -- This Is Your Final Warning!)I wanted to see Unbreakable very badly, but now I find myself wondering if, indeed, I saw the same movie that everyone else seems to be raving about. Whatever I expected from Unbreakable, I came away disappointed.Without delving into to spoiler-ish details, I think I can say that there is a mystery -- or at least a secret -- at the heart of this film, and I saw through that secret very, very early in the film. I was amazed to find that what I had suspected so quickly turned out to be the truth -- and that nearly everyone else seems to find this revelation so surprising. So much of Unbreakable's dramatic energy seems to draw from the film's core mystery, that I couldn't even give the film a passing grade with my IMDb vote; once I'd seen to the heart of the film's mystery so early, there was little else left, story-wise.The movie does have excellent acting from all its players. Samuel L. Jackson is flawless, as ever, while Bruce Willis seems to be making a smooth transition from Action Hero Guy to Everyday Actor Guy. Robin Wright is so good at inhabiting her character that you almost forget she's playing a role. Even the smaller roles of Willis' son and Jackson's mother are well cast and very well acted.There is some clever cinematography (complete with a very dark yet naturalistic palette -- quite unusual, given the film's subject matter), some novel camera angles, and a number of very interesting individual scenes. Willis' first attempt at ""fighting crime"" (so to speak) provides a chilling sequence, well shot, and almost guaranteed to have you on the edge of your seat from the tension.Still, all these excellent parts do not make a satisfying whole, in my opinion. There's still the problem that Unbreakable seems to rely on its core mystery too heavily -- and if you figure out that fairly obvious secret too early (as I did), then the rest of the central story is likely to seem slow and rather predictable. I kept thinking that the film's slow and careful pace meant that there was yet more to be revealed than I had guessed at -- but sadly, this was not the case.Unbreakable is not a bad film, by any means, but you could find it a very obvious and predictable film if you happen to figure out the central mystery early on -- best to rent this one, I think, so that you don't accidentally cheat yourself out of full admission price by guessing too well, too early.",Unbreakable

660,TBeaven,A surprisingly strong film,10,15 October 2002,"This part of this review is a non-spoiler for those of you who wish to be surprised by the film. In a few paragraphs you will be warned that spoiler material is about to arrive.Unbreakable is a film done by M. Night Shyamalan, the man who wrote and directed the surprise hit ""The Sixth Sense"" and later the very awful ""Signs"". The Sixth Sense was well regarded by many largely because of the surprise ending, and by the realization that Bruce Willis can actually act. However, while the Sixth Sense was well regarded by critics and filmgoers, after you know the surprise it lost much of its luster. The Sixth Sense was also massively flawed in several key areas which made repeat viewings difficult and often painful. The young boy star of the film also became quickly overexposed, and proved to be a fairly dense representative of his craft.Unbreakable is similar in several ways, and many are drawing quick parallels between the two. Both films are by the same director. Both films star Bruce Willis. Both are within the thriller genre. The filming style is near identical between the two. Most importantly, both are advertised as having ""twist"" endings.However, while the films are similar on paper, the actual resemblance is like comparing a dinner at McDonalds to a fine steak dinner in a five star restaurant. While the Sixth Sense banked on the twists to ultimately make the film, Unbreakable delivered without the cheap tricks needed to catch the audience. The Sixth Sense was a decent film on the surface... but Unbreakable is a great film in nearly every aspect.Warning: The below material is considered a spoiler.The big surprise with Unbreakable lies with Samuel Jackson. Unbreakable stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson, with both men on opposite ends of the spectrum. This is key to the film, and one of the reasons that Unbreakable is a far better film than the Sixth Sense. Unlike the goofy secret in that film that doesn't hold up if you think about it long enough... this one makes good sense, and the clues left throughout the film actually lead logically to the ending.Unbreakable is a superhero film, but it's not obvious to casual viewers because in the past superhero films are filmed as action flicks and not as thriller/dramas. The closest film to Unbreakable would be Darkman, but even that film had an ""over the top"" feel that Unbreakable does not. Unbreakable actually does seem like a ""real"" superhero film... and so it works as one of the best ever made, if not *the* best ever made. The film is a very smartly done tip of the hat to the comic book genre.Bruce Willis is unable to be harmed physically, has superhuman strength, and the ability to read evil intent through touch. He also has a good heart... and has made huge sacrifices in his life for others. He doesn't know that he has powers, and his discovery of this fact is the main focus of the film. His family life is a wreck, but like his powers the reasons behind this are revealed over the course of the film. Unbreakable is a story of discovery, and it nicely fits that the various plots of the film are rolled out over time rather than being simply thrust at you. By writing the film this way the audience grows into the movie and thus it is far more effective in selling the emotions and trials of the characters.Samuel Jackson, as mentioned above, is the opposite of Willis. Born with a bone disease, Jackson is accident prone. Over his life he has had more than 60 fractures, and now lives his life with extreme care. Padding lines the walls of his car, his home and shop is equipped with ramps and handlebars. He's live his life with this disease, and because of the lack of physical activity he started reading comic books at a young age. This fact seems trivial, but it effected his thinking. Jackson reasoned that if he was more accident prone, there must be someone who is less accident prone. Thus, Jackson has began searching for great tragedies that had one key element: they had one survivor. One person who miraculously survived without a scratch.Samuel Jackson is the villain in the film. The disease which wrecked his life has also led to an obsession to find his opposite. Not only did he look into great tragedies to find the sole survivor... Samuel Jackson decided to actually cause the tragedies to speed his search. His villainy fits with the comic feel of the film in several ways which are revealed throughout the film.If you have read this far, there aren't really any secrets left. This won't stop you from enjoying what is an amazingly good film. Bruce Willis doesn't have a demanding acting role in this film... but perhaps because of that he seems brilliant in his role. Casting can be key to the success of a film... and this film was cast very, very well.",Unbreakable

Instead of graphic violence and lots of blood, he makes cameras slowly pan around corners or through slightly opened doors. He cleverly uses shadows. And in this film, Shayamalan even uses the same moody lead actor: Bruce Willis! (In one of the DVD's features, Willis says he agreed to make ""Unbreakable"" without even knowing what the movie was about). In this fine suspense/mystery, David Dunn (Willis) starts learning and remembering some unusual things about himself after he's involved in a major accident. Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson) is a quirky, brooding stranger who wants David to discover what these revelations mean. I think Jackson enjoys wearing unusual wigs (see ""Pulp Fiction, ""Formula 51/The 51st State"", ""Soul Men""). And Elijah Price's hair truly is unique! ""Unbreakable"" strikes the right balance in its seriousness while still telling a cool comic-style story. Great acting performances by David's wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). One scene that the family shares in the kitchen is truly harrowing. Willis and Jackson are top-notch as acquaintances/adversaries/allies. And like other Shayamalan movies, what you THINK is going to happen often doesn't. A cool and creepy comic caper. *8 out of 10*",Unbreakable
662,mikfisher64,Life: a double edge sword,6,16 October 2010,"As ""die hard"" fan of both Bruce Willis and Samuel L.Jackson fan i was greatly excited to see this piece, since the last time i've seen them side by side was in Die Hard 3.In a way i was disappointed by the progression of the film, since i was expecting a thriller revolving around more action ; however i forgot this was a M.Night Shyamalan movie.Having said that, this movie has a slow pace, focused on the dialogs and the background of the main characters, recalling the events of the past which made who they are.The story follows David Dunn, an average Joe in society. Be that as it may, he's not an ordinary man: and with the help of Elijah (Samuel), he unfolds the truth about himself, eventually discovering his purpose.There's no doubt about the quality of the actors ; the plot is interesting but the screenplay could be more attractive, or at least less tedious.It's undoubtedly a good movie , not a emmy winner, but still entertaining . The feeling i have is, though the story is M.Night's, the directing could have had other direction, mainly more unpredictable and more vivid. I'd say that producing a part II could also be amusing, should it be made differently.In the end, one of them meets his fate and the other fulfills his destiny.6.4/10",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan took.This film, I daresay, had the least twist that M. Night Shyamalan made. The film itself was too normal, I felt like the story was very predictable. Also the ending wasn't surprising that made me felt worth watching till end. It had a very normal ""Hero Movie Ending.""The reason I gave 6.5 was because this movie was way below my expectation toward M. Night Shyamalan's movie. I feel like after sixth sense, his twists aren't that strong, and I think this movie is one of his failure in twists. Also, the meaning and the lessons of the movie was a little bit weak that made me felt good of watching. This movie was a bit not memorable. Also I think this was a bad hero movie, it wasn't too different from other hero movie. If I were to choose one hero movie to watch, I wouldn't choose this. Overall, I was disappointed at the director's twist and story of this movie. However, the actors were great.",Unbreakable

Let's make it clear from the very beginning.  `Unbreakable' earns a five out of five in my book.  As far as everything goes, story, acting, directing, etc., this film was top-notch.  It deserves superlative awards all around for being just that great.However, `Unbreakable' provides an awful dilemma for me.  As a critic, I am supposed to tell you what the movie is about and if it's any good.  It's my job and I enjoy doing it well.  But I am a film critic for one reason alone; I love movies.  I'm a true movie and I love everything about the process of creating these stories through pictures and sound.  The concept is just so extraordinary for me; I want to make it a part of my life.This is the part of me that's making it so hard to review this film.It's a big of a God complex being a critic.  We go around hoping that our opinions actually mean something.  We go around hoping that somewhere out there, a person has read a review that we wrote and based on our review, decided whether or not to see a particular film.  But most of all, we go around hoping we're right.Now, for those of you who truly want to enjoy this film as much as I did, I'm going to ask you to do something drastic: stop reading my story.  Go on. Stop.  Read another review.  Try Buzz (I take just as much care with that as I do an article).  Just whatever you do, do not continue reading this article.Part of the thrill of this movie is learning what's going to happen from the film itself.  If you find yourself going out of your way to learn more about a movie than you should know, I come to tell you that as a compatriot, you're just ruining the experience of motion pictures.  `Unbreakable' has proven that for me. If you're still reading, this is your last warning because starting the next sentence, I'm talking in specifics.David Dunne (Bruce Willis) is a security guard at a college football stadium who ends up being the only surviving victim of a train wreck.  Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is a man whom since birth has had the rare disorder called `osteogenesis imperfecta,' which means he has extremely brittle bones that shatter very easily.  Elijah has some interesting theories about why David survived.That's it.  Honest to goodness, that's the plot.  A lot of people were actually bugged when they found out the trailer told them nothing about what the movie was about.  Well guess what?  That's all you need to know.  The rest of the film is a slow-moving evolution of these simple ideas that gradually get more complex.People who were fans of `The Sixth Sense' and expecting the same kind of thing will not be disappointed, but the two films are very different in their construction.  Where `The Sixth Sense' builds with an intensity and dramatic fervor, finishing on a hidden, yet always visible ending, `Unbreakable' is much slower, lingering on characters every breath and reaction, floating like a feather to finally landing on a hidden, yet always visible ending.The greatest accomplishment in the film is that of writer and director M. Night Shyamalan.  Since his huge success with `The Sixth Sense,' Shyamalan has matured as a writer, and particularly as a director.  The story never looses its dream-like edge, feeding of the characters' personalities.  The film never needs to go too much into establishing the characters (although it does anyway) because from the very first moment on screen, it's clear who they are.Each shot is perfectly framed, often using balance to create an almost excessively perfect photo-realistic painting feel to each shot.  The symmetry is visually wonderful, yet never totally distracting and leave the audience caught in a world that they know isn't real, but they still feel a part of it.I feel I need to note the affinity Shyamalan has for comic books and how much that plays into the movie.  Now hear me out, I'm not saying `Unbreakable' is only for geeks who love `X-Men' and know the subtle nuances of the art (although it doesn't hurt).  Shyamalan has attempted to recreate the soft, shadowy feel of many modern graphic novellas while never going dark, gothic or Tim Burton on the viewer.  Many of the frames could be cut out of the reel and with the addition of thought bubbles, be turned into a comic.  The effect is that good.Ultimately though, `Unbreakable' is about more than just a great movie; it's about an audience willing to let the filmmaker take them on an unexpected ride.  Shyamalan deserves that opportunity to whisk us away and he doesn't disappoint.  It's a tad distressed to read that `Unbreakable' will be made into a trilogy because, despite an ending that you tug at for more, some things are just better left unsaid.With the holiday season finally starting, imagine `Unbreakable' as that present you got as a kid that was in an odd shape and you thought you knew what was inside but you wanted to wait until just the right moment to find out what was inside because you were honestly pretty much stumped.  As you watch the movie, let the ribbons come off and be glad you didn't tear away at any corners to take a peek.",Unbreakable
667,JasonS,The dangers of hyphenates!,5,10 July 2001,"This is what can happen when one man is in charge of thecreative process. While the Sixth Sense was good, Unbreakable is self-indulgent, lacking in pace and has all the hallmarks of aproject lacking sufficient critical input. Shame, as the feel of themovie was excellent at times and there are some wonderful,playful ideas here. But it should have been a short.",Unbreakable
668,SuMac,Disappointing for me,6,25 November 2000,"Shall I begin by telling you how many times I nodded off?  I went in expecting great things (but not the same things) from Bruce, Shyamalan and Samuel L., and while the acting was terrific, I just couldn't get into the story.  Prime example, when your premise is a guy who survives a train wreck, the least you could do is SHOW the train wreck!  I'd have settled for a Fugitive insert at that point!  Sorry, I just cannot recommend it.",Unbreakable
669,DukeFan,oh so close to great,7,24 November 2000,"I thought that the 6th Sense was the best movie I had seen in a long time, so I made a point of seeing Unbreakable on opening night.  While the two movies had some similarities, Unbreakable is a different type of movie from its predecessor, and perhaps suffered from my expectations being so high.99% of the movie I would rate as being good to outstanding, however the last minute of the movie killed it for me.  After revealing the surprise ending, which was almost as satisfying as that of the 6th Sense, the movie closed with two sentences shown as titles on the screen telling us what happened next.First of all, I think this technique is more effective in comedy, such as the end of Animal House (although sometimes even these fall flat), or in movies based on a true story, Music of the Heart being a recent example.Secondly, and more importantly, the explanation these titles gave for Unbreakable were unbelievably trite and anti-climatic compared to how strong the story for the rest of the movie was.If Shamalayan could have come up with a better way to close the movie, I would have given it a 9 or 10 rating.  As it is, I think I am being generous to give it a 7.",Unbreakable
670,gprime,I am.....batman????,9,24 November 2000,"WOW!  I absolutely was not expecting what ""Unbreakable"" gave me. Who in their right mind could have expected a SUPERHERO movie? I will not give anything away about this film's awesome ending, though comic fans will get a laugh out of how true to form it really is...Really though, I tip my proverbial cap to M. Night for trying to and SUCCESSFULLY pulling off making Bruce Willis a ""real life"" superhero.      With a running time under two hours this movie come in at FEELING like about two hours and fifteen minutes. Yes, it does have it's slow moments.  BUT, with a movie that is ALL character development (will he ever be ""allowed"" to use effects shots?) this can be expected.  The camera work was excellent, with many unusual angles and areas that cameras just DON'T usually get into when you are watching a mainstream release.  This man absolutely takes risks in his craft and so far they have all paid off now with two hits in succession! I really feel that I've neglected saying anything about Samuel L. Jackson, who has to be the most unheralded actor in all of Hollywood. How many excellent movies AND roles does he have to do before we see him at the top of the heap???  Just add this role, as the brittle Mr Glass, in with the rest of his unbelievable parts.  You'll definitely love his character by film's end. One final thing...WHO would have thought that someone BESIDES Kevin Smith, had such a love of comicbooks?  If you see this film, think to yourself: ""Is the director trying to say that he wants a superhero franchise with this film?""  I think this picture is a major campaign for M. Night to get a big time costumed crimefighter...does anyone else??? Go see this excellent flick!!!!",Unbreakable
671,AJE21,I can't believe I wasted my time watching this,4,9 September 2002,"Another waste of an interesting idea (like Stargate and The Matrix). They had an good idea, but what did they do with it?

672,Oops-3,Nothing Special,6,23 November 2000,"I've Been Waiting for this movie for a long time. And just like Pay It Forward, It was disappointing. The Acting of Bruce Willis was so slow and lazy. And Jackson wasn't better. The little boy was nothing compared to Haley, although he tried his best, and i respect him for that.The plot was not that strong, and the ending sucked. Why is M. Night Shaymalan trying to make another Sixth Sense? The direction of the movie was much like The Sixth Sense. And although it is one of my favorite movies, i think doing the same thing again and again is boring, and not creative. The music was good i think, it fit perfectly with the scenes.My conclusion was that the movie was not creative, the story was not so strong, the acting was not that good. And it was just a try to create another Sixth Sense. And in addition to that, the movie was boring for the most part, with interesting final 20 minutes( Excluding the ending). 5.5/10",Unbreakable
673,Lone Wolf,Unquestionable - one of my favorite movies of 2000,9,30 May 2001,"I'll begin by saying that Unbreakable is neither a sequel nor in the same genre as The Sixth Sense. If you want The Sixth Sense, go rent it and stop leaving messages about how much this movie WASN'T like The Sixth Sense.That said... this was a brilliant drama about a security guard who gets involved in a train wreck during a period of irreconcilable differences with his wife. And just a note to those of you who paid to see this movie for a train wreck - YOU DON'T GET TO SEE IT. Go rent Faces of Death if you want that sort of footage.David Dunne is contacted by the eccentric owner of a comic book art gallery who tells him that he is something more than human. David slowly begins to realize he's never been sick... he is stronger and tougher than the average person. We can rebuild him... we can... oops. 6 Million Dollar Man flashback - sorry. While some people didn't like that it took David this long to figure out he was more than human, remember that a blind man doesn't know he's blind until you tell him. David spends the majority of the movie experimenting with his powers and contemplating what he should do with them. David's son is curious and excited that his father seems to have these abilities and actually threatens David's life in an attempt to prove his father's powers.This is an excellent movie... Shyamalan uses camera angles and techniques to ""frame"" nearly every shot as if it was a section of a comic book page. Other comic references, such as the use of colors for certain characters, are obvious. You don't have to be a comic book fan to like this movie, but you could probably appreciate it more if you were.My only complaint is the text at the very end of the movie... I think a movie like this would have been better if they left the audience not knowing exactly how everything ends. I was also extremely disappointed to hear that the rumors of Unbreakable being a trilogy were false. Unfortunately, Shyamalan doesn't want to make sequels (so forget about Sixth Sense Part II as well) which explains why he turned down the chance to write Indiana Jones 4. I think Unbreakable is worth a chance... but rent it knowing that it's not a horror movie, nor do they show the train crash. If you still want to see it knowing those facts ahead of time, you'll probably love this movie.",Unbreakable

This didn't bother me - I'm patient and I enjoy character buildups and so on....if it all goes somewhere interesting. In this case the movie ends suddenly just at the point where it's starting to pick up speed, as if the idea-machine ran out of batteries.All throughout the movie I was waiting in optimistic anticipation, enjoying the mental game, and waiting.....some interesting ideas were presented, such as the meaning of comic-book heroes in the modern world. The two main characters were interesting and mysterious.But the movie gets all tangled up in a slow and somewhat aimless progression. Bruce Willis' character has a special power...but what is it exactly? Exactly what are his limits? Instead of developing one aspect, such as the 'unbreakable' concept, the story turns into a new spin on Steven King's 'Dead Zone', but not nearly as complete. By the end of the movie the story of Bruce Willis character's new existence has barely begun - and yet this is what I was waiting for the whole time! It ends with a couple of silly comments intended to tie things up, but it's all quite disappointing.Had it been at least another 30 minutes longer it could have gone somewhere.I gave the movie a 5/10 for good (albeit incomplete) character studies and some interesting ideas, but because the plot ended up disappointing and leaving a lot of ideas in the fetal stage I took off 5 points. If you into it expecting it not to deliver on its main ideas, then you may really enjoy it.Sorry - it's really not nearly as good as everyone seems to be making it out to be. I preferred Sixth Sense....and The Dead Zone!",Unbreakable
679,trevor-41,Willis and Shyamalan: An Unbreakable Duo,10,3 March 2001,"It's a very difficult thing, trying to be original in Hollywood. Everything has been done and re-done.  If you do think of something new, it probably isn't good because... if it was, someone would have done it already.  And producers, they like more of the same; they like to be able to predict bottom lines.  All these thigns are going against M. Night Shyamalan, Unbreakable's writer-director, but amazingly, he has followed his wholly original The Sixth Sense with another mind boggling supernatural realist movie.. And it's fantastic.  He pairs up again with Bruce Willis, and I think that the two have forged one of those old fashioned Hollywood relationships.  I hope so, because they work perfectly together.  Willis has taken form in Hollywood as an everyman, the kind of actor I suspect Alfred Hitchcock would have cast in his films were he alive and working today.Willis plays an ordinary man in Unbreakable, who has to face the possibility that he is extraordinary.  (very mild spoilers ahead) After being the sole survivor of a train wreck, Willis is approached by a comic book shop owner (Samuel L. Jackson) who has an incredible theory: What if Willis is unbreakable, an indestructible force not unlike Superman, Spiderman and the other inhabitants of Jackson's comic book world. Sounds silly, doesn't it? Watch Shyamalan make you believe in it. Everything is unpolished, and that's the magic technique.  It's grainy, it's 100% real, and then it's a superhero movie.  Shyamalan's characters are most important, more than anything else.  Unbreakable would have been a good movie without the train wreck and the superpowers.  It's well acted and heartfelt.  Bringing in the supernatural seems so right, though, and if I knew how Shyamalan did that, then I would be writing a script right now instead of a review. His is one of the most fertile minds in Hollywood history, and I urge anyone to see what this craftsman has crafted. Be amazed.",Unbreakable

The film's hard, filth ridden view of modern life sets an excellent scene from which the not so likely hero of good may be illuminated.  The films cast is squarely suited to the cold, slow screenplay. Bruce Willis excels in the leading role which contains suprisingly little anger or comedy, the usual trademarks of Willis.

Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film, The Sixth Sense. I wasn't expecting it to be better than The Sixth Sense, but I thought it came close to being as good.Bruce Willis turned in another great performance in this film. I never took him seriously as an actor (but loved him as an action star) until The Sixth Sense. Who knew John McClane was capable of this? He plays David Dunn, who meets up with comic book junkie Elijah Price (AKA MR. GLASS sorry, I thought it was just a cool nickname), who is played by the great Samuel L. Jackson. Most of the movie consists of Price trying to convince Dunn that he is not like the other people. After reading all those comic books, Price is convinced that Dunn is a superhero. Dunn does all he can to come up with evidence that he is not superhuman despite his scratchless history. Some may say that all that was slow, but I think it's necessary. It always keeps you guessing.One of the main things that turned so many people off was the ending. It was a great ending, but they were expecting it. After The Sixth Sense and after hearing all the reviewers mention it, the audience is expecting an ending as mindblowing as The Sixth Sense's. It wasn't as good, but it was still a pretty good ending. If we weren't looking for it, it would have come out from nowhere like the Sixth Sense's. Unless M.

Most of the positive reviews on this site are afflicted with ""Sixth Sense Euphoria"" and the rest are afflicted with stupid, seventeen-year-old, Roger Ebert, wannabeeitis.  Well, I've taken my ""reality"" antibiotics and feel just fine, thank you.  Bottom line is this: If you love the ""Sixth Sense"" plot structure and style, are sucked in by hype, love ridiculous comic storylines, and are willing to overlook an awful attempt to recapture past glory, you'll love ""Unbreakable"".

I don't own The Sixth Sense and don't plan on it. Unbreakable is so much deeper than Shyamalan's previous work and his camera angles and scripting are so innovative. The opening unedited train scene is just unique and you have to give credit to a man that is willing to try something new.

The films expertise story, casting and dialog make for an excellent film alone, but is drowned by it's narrow, dark-lighting.

Willis and Jackson are excellent in their roles, and the movie is excellent. The big twist at the end had me surprised. The fact that Elijah did it all was so unsuspected. It made sense though, David and Elijah were two halves of a whole story arc involving superheroes and I'm excited to see what will be done in the future.",Unbreakable

692,delo,Not that great--boring,3,18 February 2002,"Samuel Jackson was good in this movie but Bruce Willis put in a very lackluster performance. I liked the whole comic book hero angle but wished they had done more with it.  Very slow-moving movie.  Once it established its main theme, it didn't do much with it. It was fun watching Bruce Willis little by little realize he had special powers, but with that established, again, nothing interesting was done with it.   If you're thinking that only comic book fans would like the movie, all I can say is I've got thousands of comics and I thought this movie was quite dull.",Unbreakable

I might revise that later to a 7, since I typically rate movies lower after I have had time to compare them to other movies.  Anyway...On the whole, this is a very good movie. However, at times during the movie you will be asking yourself, ""What is going on?  This does not make sense!"" In some parts it seems disjointed.  But, that does not ruin the overall experience.Bruce Willis does a good job and Samuel L. Jackson does a very good job in a supporting role.  Overall, the cast meshes together well.  But, I do wish some of the relationships had been explored a bit more.You have to make your own conclusions about how David Dunn relates to his wife and son.  Plus, his past is a bit muddled, but the movie at least tries to fit it together, unlike other movies.  After seeing the movie you will wonder if there is a Director's Cut.Is this movie as good as Sixth Sense?  No.  Is it as good or better than current movie fare? Yes.

After looking over all of the comments that everyone made about this movie, I'm really sick of people trying to be clever by putting the words ""Unbearable"" or ""Unwatchable"" in their summaries.  Obviously this is a ""Love it or hate it"" movie. Personally, I liked it.  I have been collecting comics for about fifteen years now, and I liked the way that Shyamalan incorporated elements from comic books into his story.  I thought it was an interesting idea that there could be a man who had superhuman gifts but didn't realize it.  I didn't mind the slow pace of the movie, and I liked the dark, somber look of the movie, which reflected the sadness Dunn felt about how his life had turned out.  The scenes with Joseph in them added a necessary amount of humor which kept the film from being too depressing.  The first time I saw the film, I was totally surprised by the ending.  Unlike the Sixth Sense, this movie didn't have any real clues as to what was going to happen at the end.  But I did like the surprise twist, no matter what anyone else says.",Unbreakable

He sets up Bruce Willis' character and Samuel L. Jackson's character well enough, but they don't come together and make the audience feel like it did for Osment's and Willis' characters in ""The Sixth Sense"".Although most of ""Unbreakable"" tries to set up Willis as someone who is going to learn a lot about himself, he only learns as much as the audience deduces in the first twenty minutes, and this leads to an anti-climatic ending, which brings the entire movie along with it. I think this is overall a good movie, and it has many parts in it that capture the audience's attention and make us wonder what else is going to happen, but the characters just don't have that feeling that they are learning about themselves like Willis and Osment do in ""Sixth Sense"".If you liked ""Sixth Sense"" and want a movie a little slower and more low-key than ""Unbreakable"" is a must-see M.

I won't bore you with a plot summary but be forewarned:  save your money!  The major problem with this film is sentimentality.  It takes itself too seriously for a movie about comic books.  There is such a heavy-handed sense of grief for its entire duration that the resolution becomes awkward and thus ludicrous.  Jackson and Willis compete with each other to see who can maintain a sad, puppy-dog look the longest.

697,FabF,Get real,4,3 December 2000,"Unbreakable? Oh, please.I just can't understand what the fuss is about. This movie seems to lack everything: less then poor, the story was nonexistent; more than foreseeable, the action was squarely boring.Basically, you could split that movie into two parts. The first 90 minutes, spent on preparing (slooowly, sooooo slooowly) what you know is bound to happen in the last 15 minutes. And then the last 15 minutes, depicting exactly what you've been expecting since you've been sitting in the theater (and frankly, nothing to cry over).I saw this movie because I had loved the Sixth Sense and I expected to like Unbreakable at least as much. But M. Night Shyamalan truly disappointed me this time. What could explain the critics' infatuation, if the movie is so bad? I suppose they might be trying to make up for their ferocious reviews of The Sixth Sense, a way to say to the director: ""Hey, man, we're sorry, we shouldn't have been so mean about your previous film, so even though this one really sucks, but I mean rrreally blows, we'll be cool about it. Will you forgive us? Please?""GET REAL. Unbreakable is a bad movie. This unbearable analogy between comic books and real life literally stinks.

698,sleeper-10,"Not Quite a Masterpiece, But Not WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!",7,2 December 2000,"Just saw this tonight and I'm still puzzled as to how I feel about the film. Having skimmed through some of the comments it appears people are either embracing it as a masterpiece or reviling it as a boring piece of garbage. I won't go so far as to suggest this film is a masterpiece, but it certainly skews closer to that end of the spectrum than the other.Things I Liked:1) Bruce Willis.  Lots of people said he was really really boring, which is their way of saying, ""He wasn't being John McClane, he wasn't the Bruce Willis I am used to.  I don't get it.""  Understated acting does not necessarily mean boring.  He was playing a sad, confused Everyman (at least emotionally), it would be ludicrous for him to spout lame one-liners and start crawling into ventilation ducts.  I thought he did a great job.2) Samuel L. Jackson.  The Willis-Jackson chemistry is great here, better than their DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE team-up, and Jackson by himself is fantastic as he almost always is.  He had the more flamboyant and unusual of the two lead roles, so perhaps he had the advantage over Willis, but he manages to keep his character from flying up into the camposphere by delivering fantastical dialogue seriously.3) The comic book as modern mythology idea was interesting although underdeveloped, like the movie itself really.  I wish they had trimmed a good fifteen or so minutes of longing stares and slow motion shots of people standing around so they could have afforded more screen time to developing the movie's central premise, that is, that the power and truth of Mythic Reality can and does exist in the modern world, filtered and diluted though it might be.Things I Didn't Like:1) Okay, I hate to sound like a Bruckheimer-loving yokel, but this movie really did drag.  I'm not asking for even one gratuituous car chase, but please, Night, zip it up a little.  I felt every one of this movie's one hundred and fifteen minutes.  2) Like THE SIXTH SENSE, this is a film more or less without plot.  The plot, such as it is, is the growth and self-realization of a character. That's fine and dandy, but I kept waiting for Clark Kent to finally move to Metropolis, so to speak.  Willis spends the whole movie stuck in Smallville here, and when it finally does look as if he's about to maybe tear open his shirt to reveal the big red S (metaphorically speaking of course), they hit us with the ending...3)....which, to put it the least, I did not like.  It was an interesting twist, I'll grant the filmmakers that.  I loved Jackson's final rambling speech, it was great, sad and horrifying all at once.  But then they go and ruin it by stapling a very clumsy, very awkward text card ""Epilogue"" onto the final frames.  Ugh.  First of all, it's not like this is true story (I expected another title to read ""(so-and-so) is still at large.  If you have any information as to the whereabouts of this person, please notify the theater manager."") so that makes no sense.  Secondly, the movie was so drawn-out and elongated (which at times worked and at other times did not) that to truncate the ending like that, to resolve the story in a rush and not even visually but with text, felt like a huge cheat.Overall I give this movie a 7.  Worth seeing at least once.",Unbreakable

Only thing is, we ended up being disapointed.  Many parts were interesting and fun, such as the one scene about the Japanese comics, I am a huge Japanese animation fan and instead of comics, it's actual name is manga, and the genre would be hentai.  ^_^;Anyway, it was a very interesting idea for a movie, but it dragged on in the begining a little too much and could have done more with reasons behind things, such as more time about the ending, and about all different things involved.Again, this movie was quite interesting, but wasn't as good as it looked. But Bruce was great even though his character seemed odd almost like he had no emotions or something.  That probably doesn't make any sense.

702,zhoule2,Mediocre people will think this is mediocre,8,30 November 2000,"The last time I walked out of a screening almost in tears was about four or five years ago. Back in a film theory class. The film? ""Searching For Bobby Fischer."" A tale about a seemingly ordinary kid who realizes that -- though the help of a mentor -- he might be blessed with some sort of hidden talent.Sort of along the same lines, this film is kinda what you'd get if you crossed ""Fearless"" with an ""X-Files"" episode and ""Searching ..."". A guy survives a train wreck and slowly --with the help of a ""mentor"" (quotes deliberate) -- suspects that he might have a ""gift"" that allowed him to walk away unscathed. (I say no more).This is a beautiful, slowly unraveling gem of a film about the true potential each and everyone has -- but usually squanders by becoming part of mainstream society. As one character says: ""These are mediocre times,"" so maybe there's a socio-economic reason behind why this film is being coolly received by some. Mediocre people will not like this film. (And there's a lot of you out there.)There are some interesting similarities between this and the director's previous film, ""The Sixth Sense"": Bruce Willis, the twist ending, the symbolism of glass (broken or not), the emotionally frigid wife, the messed-up kid, and so on.Comparisons end there. In actual fact, I think this is a better movie than ""The Sixth Sense"" as the tone of this movie is a little bit more consistent. (It's also darker, but without quite as much bloodletting.)
So, were there any problems with ""Unbreakable""? Three, to my tastes:
1) There shouldn't have been credits over the *brilliant* opening scene -- not counting the prologue. The identity of the camera's point-of-view during that long, back-and-forth shot between David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and the woman on the train is a subtle touch2) There's a scene half-way through the movie involving Dunn's son that's a little over-the-top and perhaps out of place, character-wise. Actually, the scene (along with a trim to one just after it) could have been taken out and it wouldn't really affect the plot. I think if people are getting lost -- this scene in question is the one that's causing people to scratch their heads a bit.3) The ""twist"" comic-book-like ending. Really unnecessary and it feels like a gimmick than something which adds to the story. And, upon thinking about it, it rather cheapens the entire movie.Two or three minor trims (that would taken maybe five to seven minutes out of the film) and this would have been a master-stroke. But what remains is still an intensely beautiful movie. Don't believe the negative criticisms -- this is a great film, and it's probably better than 95 per cent of the stuff unspooling in cinemas at the moment.",Unbreakable
703,Sub-atomic,Moody and interesting,7,15 December 2000,"Not surprisingly, the movie has a similar melancholy feel to sixth sense (excuse me for being monotonous).  I'm no expert, but I suspect that this is a trademark of the particular director.  Don't get me wrong; ""Unbreakable"" is a good flick.  I was kept wondering what was going to happen next.  It turns out that the story has pretty much been done before, but the moody aspect and the excellent acting makes it different enough to be interesting.It has been commented that Bruce Willis's performance was wooden.  Well duh. He was supposed to be a sad and dispirited man.  The viewer is even directed clearly to this observation via Mr Willis within the dialogue!  How else was he supposed to portray the character?  Perhaps with a song or two? I thought he did it just right, once again proving that he is an extremely versatile actor.If your criteria for a good movie are limited to action and special effects, or slightly brain-damaged, but nice looking teenagers, then I suggest that you give this one a miss.  On the other hand, if you are like me and like a movie to be original and done with art and skill, regardless of the genre, then I recommend this movie to you.",Unbreakable

Both main characters (Price & Dunn) though hero/villain comic types, reach into your very soul. The photography was excellent, and the script magnificent.  The DVD is a worth while attainment, which includes a cut from M.Night's first fight scene he ever film, it's classic...In my opinion, Night will go down as one the premiere film makers of this era, should he continue to do films like this one & The Sixth Sense. Unbreakable appears to ""break"" some new ground in comic book type films. It is also noteworthy that ending opens the door to the possibility of a sequel.

Personally I believe that the entire idea of superheros and superpower has been adapted to screen countless number of times and has therefore lost its impact and interest on a modern audience. On the other hand, I must say that Shyamalan's directing is impeccable and is characterized, throughout the entire movie, by a considerable amount of style and class. Under a technical point of view everything seems to be perfect, from the photography to the continuous slow movements of the camera which match perfectly the captivating rythm of the film itself. Furthermore, the director's choice of depicting the characters from far, unusual points of view seems to compensate rather well for Bruce Willis's notorious lack of acting skills. In addition, James Newton Howard's score represents ,despite the criticism, the completion of Unbreakable's technical perfection. Hence, Shyamalan can undoubtedly be considered one of the most talented of the new generation directors along with David Fincher and a few others.",Unbreakable

In addition he once again writes a great, compelling screenplay.  The only tiny criticism I have is 1) the movie dragged a bit early on and 2) I think it was too soon to use Bruce Willis again, although I will admit he was a good fit for the character.",Unbreakable

716,sevendoc23,Mister glass and broken story,6,10 December 2018,"This is quite late as a review but still I thought I'd write it anyways. Unbreakable is a film by M. Night Shyamalan and comes with all the things you'd expect with his earlier work. A slow burner drama, dark and brooding atmosphere, and a great story concept. The only real issue with this film is how stunted everything feels. The characters, the dialogue, amf the plot have no real sense of urgency that's needed to keep a slow burner drama alive and I feel that mostly hinges or the poor delivery from our main cast (excepting Samuel Jackson who has a stellar preformance). David (portrayed by Bruce Willis) doesn't care much for anything and based on the preformance he gives, it seems he didn't care to much about the film either. He almost always has a very non-feeling look and act to himself that makes him seem one demensional to the point that I was far more interested in the actor who played younger David than I was of David himself. Top that off with what seems like a borderline mentally abusive relationship he has with his son, and it spells disatster for a character were supposed to care about. The depression he had comes off less like he feels little to no importance or place in this world, and more like he's just a bit of an a**hole. Some scenes seemed to have no real internal logic within them and the child actor seemed to be afflicted with the same single emotion complex that Willis had throughout the film. While I enjoyed the movie, thanks in no small part to the eccentric preformance by Samuel L Jackson's, Mr. Glass, I was let down by a majority of the movie in the way it handled many scenes. It had such a tense atmosphere and great story hook but did very little with it to play on the actual drama of the film and a lot of investigative scenes in the film are handled very heavy handedly with Shyamalan treating us like we're children. With all that said, I still believe this is a must see if you enjoy Shyamalan, superheros, or slow burn dramas, so long as you go in with an open mind and focus on the storyline rather than the dialogue.",Unbreakable
717,benedikt-entner,Best of both. Willis and Shyamalan.,9,6 December 2014,"Some people state Shyamalan recycled ""The Sixth Sense"" for this film. A mysterious plot, check, Bruce Willis takes the leading role, check, and a twist at the end, check. But the movie is more than that. In my opinion this is Shyamalan's best work so far. I still regret how biased everyone is after the 6th Sense and what a pity, this movie was not made before the other one. There is a ""prequel-sequel thing"" going on, people don't recognize how great and fresh this movie actually is. It is not a remake. Go see this movie unbiased and if you pay attention to the details, you may be surprised how good it actually is. Visually I am very attracted to this movie. The camera work is great. But Unbreakable is also a fine character study with subtle and good acting. The script reveals a real arc for every character, especially for the protagonist. In addition Willis performance in this movie is in my humble opinion one of his - if not his very best. Unbreakable has everything, structure, great acting, a simple story, a fitting score and camera work with masterful use of the color palette. The twist at the end is just a bonus and pay off, but it doesn't make the movie what it is, the tone nails it for me. Bruce Willis is the hero, who leads a double life (within his family) and has to fight against two villains. Unbreakable is a ""real life"" adaption of a superhero's tail. The plot is set in a serious, realistic environment. The characters has interesting costumes, as explained in the film commentary, the filmmakers used certain colours for an analogy. Green is our hero, an equally balance colour in the middle of the colours spectrum, a mixture between blue and yellow. It represents our superhero's virtues, intelligence and strength. Blue is intelligence, yellow is strength, you mix these colours with red and you end up with the villains coloures. Blue mixed with red violet, and yellow plus red equals orange. Red is representing evil.One of the villains is evil minded and genius, and the other one is quite the opposite, a no- brainer who uses brutal force. Violet and Orange are two colours on opposing sites of the colors spectrum. Very subtle. It is interesting they put this alegory in there.Doesn't make the movie any better, because most people won't notice it. What I find compelling about the story is that you learn everything from Samuel Jacksons character's perspective. In the beginning you hear his dubious explanations and you start to wonder and believe him. At the same time you doubt it more and more and finally you get to realize how insane Jackson's perspective really is.9/10",Unbreakable

Although I learned later that this is statistically impossible, I never really gave up on the notion; it lay dormant somewhere in my mind, until I watched Unbreakable.It's funny in a way because the film was not about someone who looked identical to someone else. Rather, it was something about how opposites can be so similar, and as much as one needs to understand evil to understand good, hot from cold, we learn about ourselves from people who are dissimilar from us: ""Now that we know who you are, I know who I am."" It's the search and exploration of the anti-self to understand one self.I started this film expecting something similar to The Sixth Sense, and ended it being awed and impressed at the suggestion of self-exploration -- a journey within oneself -- to know the person I think I understand. Certainly I will refrain from blowing up airplanes and causing trains to derail to find my opposite.Don't start this film just to expect a surprise ending (there is one), or view multiple times just to search for clues.

One could say it has the same theme as ""the Sixth Sense"", but a totally different perspective.Short recap of the story: Elijah Price is born with a serious disease making his bones very brittle. (In fact, he is born with both his arms and legs broken.) As an encouragement to make him go outside his home, his mother gives him comic books each time he ventures outside. So he grows up into a successful art dealer and comics collector (Samuel L. Jackson). He becomes fixated on the idea that if people with physical deficiensies exist, there has to be people on the other end of the spectrum wich lacks any physical weaknesses. In other words; superheroes. When a serious train crash occurs with a single survivor, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), Price is certain he has found his hero. Price then tries to convince Dunn that he really is a superhero. What follows is quite an interesting struggle between the reluctant Dunn, the charismatic Price and Dunn's son who really wants his dad to be something more heroic than an ordinary security guard. More and more we learn that Dunn might be more than he seems at the same time as Dunn and his son do. We also realise that Price might not be so disturbed as he seems, but right until the end we are kept in the dark on exactly who (if not all) of the characters live in a dream world.Short summary: If you have an open mind and would like to see a different thriller, you will probably like Unbreakable. Especially if you know your comic herobook trivia and recognise the symbolic clues sprinkled throughout the movie. If you liked Sixth Sense and think this is just a sequel with more of the same, you will probably be disappointed.",Unbreakable

Can someone please explain to me the story here? Did I miss something that others see?  I was left with an emptiness inside.  What is the point of making a film that has no story to follow?  I have seen pornos that have better plots.  I am glad that someone else paid for me, because I would have demanded my money back had I paid.  Everyone involved in this film should be ashamed and embarrassed.",Unbreakable
724,MrFlint,Very Disappointing,3,6 December 2000,"I went to see Unbreakable with high expectations. It starred two of my favorite actors in Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, and was a product of the same man who did Sixth Sense -- one of my favorite movies of all time. Unfortunately, my expectations were not only not met, it was not even close. The movie lacked suspense, it lacked any kind of character development, and it lacked anything that made us even care what happened to the characters. Worst of all, though, when the movie reached its conclusion it was as if they were short on time and had to end the movie before they ever fully developed the plot. I've seen worse movies, but not many.",Unbreakable

But I didn't detest it as much as I hated 'Unbreakable'. The director puts so much time and effort in these 'Kubrick' long shots, with cameras twirling and all, that the viewer just has to feel sorry for the actors. Or at least for Jackson, since Willis seems to be lost in some kind of a drug-induced world. By the way, what's with the stupidest superhero ever (""350 pounds? let's add some more."") and the feeblest supervillain ever (""I've had 54 fractures"") clashing in a survival of the least fit? Not that I was so much anxious to see the wild ending twist, but let's just say that the writer managed to make this boring, slow-developing film into one that has no point at all. On an unrelated note, say your 10-year-old gets a gun, and aims it at you, do you picture your wife saying ""aw, come on, don't do that"", and yourself threatening to move away forever if your child does shoot you? ""But he's unbreakable, you idiot"" Oh OK. You know a movie is more about style than substance when a camera is showing us two people seen through the space between two train seats. One at a time. Panning from one to the other. For about 6 minutes. All in one shot. And they're talking about this guy who runs 40 yards in 4.2 seconds. Believe it or not, we actually end up seeing this guy. For 2 seconds. Yippee. I was also surprised how fast Bruce went from a stupid security guard to an all-powerful Jesus/Superman type who saves the widow and the orphans, while managing to draw a little tear from his oh-so-cute son's eye. Was Night trying to do a movie about emotions? or superheroes? or both? That sensible-giant thing is getting on my nerves.Don't see this movie. It blows. Real bad. For a long time.

However this film is intelligently written, beautifully acted, and offers a lovely, melancholy glimpse at a hero's own self-recognition. The characters are all so wonderfully drawn, and feel very real.  Jackson is a revelation as always in his role, and Willis is genuinely moving as a hero who moves through the world in almost constant, quiet pain. The cinematography is beautiful, the direction quietly assured (notice that Glass is almost always viewed first through a reflection of sorts), and the score is gorgeous as well.I'd recommend it to those who love a good thriller, or who are seeking something intelligent and grown-up, off the beaten path.",Unbreakable
728,elvaago,Oh my god! (includes spoilers),4,1 December 2002,"This is a story about how the movie Unbreakable was created.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are sitting in their favourite bar together drinking beer. When they are both flaming drunk, a conversation occurs. Samuel L. Jackson says to Bruce, ""Hey Bruce, have you realised that in just about all of your movies, you get really badly hurt, enough to kill most ordinary people, but you shrug everything off and continue killing the bad guys? It's like you're superman, man!"" Bruce Willis replies, ""You know, man, you're right. It's like, I step on glass, and I run across the snow right after, and I get shot in the shoulder and then I punch someone. No matter how badly I get hurt, 2 minutes later, I'm right back into the action. But something like that goes for you too, you always play some freaky guy, even when it's supposedly normal characters. Like your eye always leaks, or you're this super negotiating guy, or this wacky mafia dude, you never play normal characters."" Samuel L. Jackson nods to Bruce and says, ""We should make this movie that has you as this dude that is really impossible to hurt, like he really is superman."" Bruce laughs and nods, ""And you should play some freaky guy that gets hurt all the time. That'd be fun."" At this point director M. Night Shyamalan walks in, drunk himself. ""Hey, we'll call it Unbreakable. It has you two in it so people will be stupid enough to like the movie, too!""And the rest is history...",Unbreakable

Leonard Maltin got it right when he described it as ""a shaggy dog story"" - but the twisted little denouement hardly qualified as a real ending. It just sort of faded into nothing!

736,pjmoore810,Unbreakable was almost unbearable,1,21 January 2001,"I went into this movie expecting something on the par of ""The Sixth Sense"", which I thought was a terrific movie.  I walked out with three other people all asking the same question I was, ""What did we just waste  two hours for???""  I spent a little more than half the movie trying to figure out the plot.  Then I suddenly realized, there was no plot.Only the last few minutes were anything of note.  But even those could not make up for the previous hour and a half of lackluster events.  It tired to make that sudden twist at the end like in ""The Sixth Sense"", but this time it failed.  Although, it did do a good job at failing.  In ""The Sixth Sense"", the twist at the end was so emotional, gut wrenching, and thought provoking because during the whole movie you were being drawn into the story.  Here, you weren't drawn in (I was slowly being repelled during the whole movie because of the lack of a story).  Everything that the little twist refers back to is stuff that you had heard about, and the movie only alluded to.  It didn't give you a chance to get interested.I would liken this viewing experience to my one and only time attending a NASCAR event.  There was a little excitement at the beginning, a little excitement scattered throughout (crashes), and a little excitement at the end.  But all in all, each lap is pretty much like the one before (they are driving around an ellipse, not a whole lot of room for change there). And at the end I walked away wondering why I went through all that trouble to waste several hours of my life for a mild case of sunburn and a sore butt.  I am just glad I didn't have to pay for this event...I wish I could say the same about this movie.At least in this case, the movie theater was climate controlled.  The only reason this isn't going to occupy my Number 1 Bad Movie is because that spot is already claimed by that abomination known as ""The Blair Witch Project"", so ""Unbearable"", ooops, I mean ""Unbreakable"" is going to have to settle for Number 2 on the Bad Movie List.",Unbreakable

739,FlickJunkie,M. Night Shyamalan continues to impress.,9,30 July 2001,"Here's yet another original creation of his that manages to successfully slap together a unique mystery, interesting characters, real life situations to which we could all relate and a touch of the paranormal. I love this guy! I hope he keeps it up because more movies like this is what we need. Of course, much like any other great film, this one is not for everybody. The film does have quite the slow pace, might come off as repetitive to some people and also manages to parallel ""The Sixth Sense"" in various ways. But for me, I was hooked from its first two scenes, which much like the film's teaser trailer, just made me sit up and say, ""What's up with that? Intriguing...now tell me more."" The sequences in question basically set up the foundation of the two main characters in this film, and let me tell you, they grabbed me and that was that. I couldn't wait to find out why they were the way that they were, and what it all meant. But Shyamalan draws the film out slowly. He already seems to have developed a great eye for the camera, setting up angles just right, enough to give us a taste of the scene, but not the whole bite. There are also little hints dropped here and there, red herrings and a Hitchcockian score providing just enough background to allow for a gradual development of the richer points in the script. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan also seems to be finding himself a small part in his own films. Here, he shows up as a suspicious ""drug dealer"" at a sports stadium.But don't expect a horror with this film. That's not what it is. It's not a thriller either. No major ""thrill"" scenes in this movie. In fact, it isn't until the last twenty minutes that the film's leisurely pace is disturbed by some invigorating energy. I would consider this picture to be more like a good ol' fashioned mystery a la ""The Twilight Zone."" Set in an ordinary environment with believable characters, this film manages to creep us out with elements which just don't seem to make sense in our reality. Of course, much like any other good story, this film would not be a complete success unless we connected to the characters on the screen, and in this movie, I did. In fact, we could all relate to what Bruce's character is essentially going through. He doesn't understand his place in the world. He is confused. He is not sure why he is what he is. What is his destiny? We've all felt like him at some point or another in our lives and you learn to recognize that in his character early on.Bruce downplayed his character as much as he did the one in ""The Sixth Sense"" (almost seemed like the same guy but in a different circumstance), while Sam Jackson was surprisingly restrained as the bizarre dude with the love of comic books. And as for the ending...don't worry I won't be giving anything away here, but suffice it to say that unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" a movie which I believed was taken to another level with that slap-in-your-face conclusion, this film's finish felt much more like a ""Hmm, yeah okay, that makes sense"" kind of thing. Of course, some might scoff at the ending, but that all depends on whether or not you were ""into"" the film as it moved along. It certainly didn't make or break the movie for me, and I doubt it will blow anyone else away either. This film is not about the ending necessarily. It is about the journey, a journey that is deliberately unhurried, melancholic and intriguing. My guess is that anyone who was greatly interested in this film by its teaser, will more than likely be impressed with this film's brilliant manner of storytelling. It looks like Shyamalan is here to stay. Of course, once the movie is over, and this seems to be developing into a very cool Shyamalan tradition, you will undoubtedly feel the need to discuss the film with others. It's engaging, it's mysterious, perhaps even unbelievable to the more cynical in our society, but ultimately the film is an excellent demonstration of what a great director, a solid script, a deeper, meaningful message and well crafted characters can bring to a theatrical presentation as such. For me, the film worked on various levels and I hope that many others like it just as much. That's it and I hope I didn't spoil anything for you...that's half the fun!Rating: 9/10",Unbreakable

749,disdained_heart,Not your traditional hero tale.,7,29 July 2007,"M. Night Shyamalan does an interesting take on a very unconventional look at ""super heroes"" and ""villains"". Set in modern day, ""Unbreakable"" follows the change in life of a man, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who inexplicably is the sole survivor of a train wreck. He is then sought out by an art dealer, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), that claims he can prove the mystery behind this incident. Price was born with a genetic defect, Osteogenesis Imperfecta, causing him to have very weak bones and be susceptible to easy breakage. He believes that he was born for a purpose, and that there is someone out there who is as strong as he is weak. He believes this man to be Dunn.This movie is not filled with high action sequences, it does not have big explosions, and it does not have any kind of spandex costumes. This is actually a very slow movie, and although easy to follow, there are many hidden meanings and symbolisms among the plot and characters. One can argue on whether or not Dunn is more than just an ordinary man and actually has a 'special' ability; or if he is merely an average human being who has been 'brainwashed' to think he is. The story does a interesting approach between Dunn and Price, in displaying the ideals and the thoughts that cross through peoples minds, in order for them to take the actions they deem necessary for what they believe in.

Every scene is almost perfect, every shot perfectly composed, every camera move perfectly used and needed, not for style but for story too. Everything is exactly where M.Night Shyamaln wanted it, everything, every little thing is Precise, every little detail, every little thing is exactly where it's supposed to be. The camera is as utilized as much as in Citizen Kane, and it doesn't ever disrupt the story nor scene either, it's placed with certainty. It's never to show off or highlight something, it's their because story said so. And the very absent of coverage is saying a lot, that every scene was shot the way he wanted, he didn't have any escapes, everything was worked out and worked perfectly, that's some freaking confidence and filmmaking. And this film follows the rule in film better then most I think ""Show don't tell"" But it does so magnificent, and it's never on the nose either, it's just perfect direction.

The slow-paced unfolding of the story would have been acceptable if there was some sort of big mystery anticipated to be revealed that somehow kept you on your seat. Its detailed way of telling a story about a birth of a superhero, which they leave out in most superhero films, may be considered as this film's strength or weakness. In a way, this detailed storytelling about the protagonist's self-discovery is unconventional because it presents a more down to earth perspective of what the character is feeling or is going through. On the other hand, it also makes you realize why these minute details are purposely left out in most superhero films -they only tend to prolong the story without adding real value to the plot.Moreover, the ending was such a letdown. As soon as Elijah said, ""I think this is where we shake hands,"" you can instantly tell the ""big reveal"" of the film. You would think that after all the pain they went through in trying to keep this certain revelation unexpected, they would deliver it in a more subtle yet surprising way. But that didn't happen. Overall, it's difficult to recommend this movie to a friend.Oh, and if anyone makes an excuse and says, ""It's just that this movie is not for everyone,"" well, be informed that I have had my fair share of appreciating films that are ""not for everyone,"" and this film does not make the cut.",Unbreakable
755,notsotame,Another botched attempt at the real greatness,7,26 November 2005,"It's one of those movies that could have been truly great and ended up as only quite good.Shyamalan takes an unoriginal idea and gives it a completely new spin. At the cursory glance, it's a typical movie about a hero struggling with his awakening powers. Just like any other comic-book story. The difference is, it doesn't feel like a comic-book story. The movie doesn't have the right atmosphere, has no flashiness at all, no fantastic events. All in all, it has no comic-book accessories. It is basically about the same thing as 'Spiderman' but gives a totally different impression. Only Shyamalan could make a comic-book story look like a gritty human drama. You really have to admire the man. Then again, there's The Moment. Never since 'A.I.' could I pinpoint the very scene, where the movie takes the turn in a completely wrong direction, with such certainty. Only, 'A.I' went bad and kept on going even badder, while 'Unbreakable' managed to recuperate at least some of the losses and strike again with an interesting, if pretty bizarre, ending. It was the last desperate attempt to redeem itself but the harm could not really be undone. When such things like The Moment happen, they stay happened forever.The Moment, actually, doesn't last more than three minutes. Three paltry minutes that somehow spoil all the other 103 minutes around them. Ironically, if the scene was slightly edited, 'Unbreakable' would turn into the great movie that the beginning promised. Even the ending would make more sense. With a few small changes in one single scene, 'Unbreakable' would be one of the best movies I've ever seen. What is that bitter taste in my mouth? Is it disappointment? The strongest point of the first hour of the movie, e.g. the good part, is its ambiguity. We can't know for sure that Bruce Willis is really all that special. He was the sole survivor of a terrible catastrophe, but he could just have had extraordinary luck. He discovers that he can lift two times more weight than before, but he could simply be a very strong guy, who wasn't aware of his own physical potential. He lifted the car to save his girlfriend, but people are capable of seemingly impossible feats if the life of their loved ones is on the line. We don't have any conclusive proof that it was all caused by some supernatural factor. The narrative is strictly subjective. We are never quite sure that Samuel L. Jackson's far-fetched theory is something more than wishful thinking.Then comes The Moment. Bruce Willis goes among people, gets a couple of low-res highly detailed visions, that could under no circumstances be given natural explanation, and all the intriguing uncertainty is suddenly lost. Bruce Willis goes after a bad guy and saves the day, half-drowning on the way. He joins the ranks of Superman, Spiderman and, uhm... that's really not my field of expertise. Ironman? Anyway, he becomes a true hero. As the immediate consequence, the movie stops being interesting.Without The Moment the ending would have been brilliant. 'Unbreakable' would have been a movie about a fanatic, who tries to force the world to play along with his insane ideas. Who, on his mission to make his vision real, disregards completely human lives. A beautiful case of megalomania. Also an excellent example of the force of conviction. He actually succeeds in creating his hero, the hero that he thinks himself destined to counterpart. An ordinary, gentle, peaceful man rises to the occasion, manages to reach the level that the self-appointed villain designed for him. Only to learn that all the way he was manipulated by a self-righteous maniac. The irony so delightfully perverse, that it sends shivers down the spine.Only, it was not to be. Why, Shyamalan? Why didn't you see it? Why did you have to make The Moment instead and ruin everything? Did you jump into the puddle of triteness willingly or was it an unfortunate slip? That I will never know.After it becomes unmistakably clear that Bruce Willis is, indeed, a superhuman with psychic powers, the movie suddenly loses its momentum. The fact that the only action sequence of the movie, therefore supposedly the most entertaining one, is just around the corner, doesn't matter at all. It's not even a little bit exciting. Bruce Willis is indestructible now, for Pete's sake. Of course he's going to win. The hero in spandex always wins. That's one of the main rules of a comic-book story and the plot suddenly became one, so all the standards apply.What's even sadder, this way the ending feels definitely lacking. I called it 'interesting, if pretty bizarre' earlier. That's still truth. It's interesting, because it takes you by surprise and wraps up Samuel L. Jackson's character really nicely. It's bizarre, and not good-bizarre at that, because it doesn't fit as an ending. It doesn't bring closure, not for the main character. In the No-Moment imaginary version of the movie, it wouldn't be the problem, because the accents would shift, Bruce Willis wouldn't be the focus point any more. In the real-life version, he still is. His story is left incomplete. And I am left dissatisfied.",Unbreakable

One preliminary comment: There are never that many people at a Penn football game. Well... except to kick Princeton's camel haired backsides. Willful suspension of disbelief only goes so far. :-) I wish Bruce Willis would make more movies like this one and fewer like Die Hard Blah Blah. He is so compelling as an obviously sad, lost man. Robin Wright Penn was good, too, but the script doesn't give her a lot to work with. Sam Jackson, as usual, hijacks your attention every minute he's on screen.I'd highly recommend the movie to anyone who liked ""Sixth Sense."" The director has some clearly recognized ""habits,"" like the physical darkness of the sets, the emotional distance between the married characters, the old fashioned score(a' la Elmer Bernstein), and the O'Henry ending, but everyone has a voice. He's consistent in his directorial style. It works.I've never even read a comic book but I seem to enjoy movies about them. Perhaps it's the lack of moral ambiguity. The bad guys are bad and the good guys are good. If only life were that simple! A couple other reviewers have called this and other M.Night movies ""family friendly,"" but I have to disagree. The movie is too emotionally dark and scary -- especially (PLOT SPOILER) the gun scene in the kitchen and the dead woman at the end.",Unbreakable

People seem to think it is some kind of gigantic disappointment. My response to that is twofold. First of all, the point of this film isn't to thrill the audience with a big payoff. Rather, viewed as a complete piece of work, it is a clever and refreshing take on the superhero genre that entertains through its craftsmanship and precision. Secondly, I found the ending to be quite satisfactory in its own right. Although I sensed early on the direction the film was taking, the ending brings it all together in a way that I did not suspect and, in fact, greatly enhanced my enjoyment of the film as a whole. I would highly recommend this film and look forward to even more from Shyamalan.",Unbreakable
760,Saavedra,Bad beyond words (but I'll try anyway),1,28 November 2000,"I can honestly say that I've never seen a movie this overrated. ""Unbreakable"" cannot hold a candle to ""The Sixth Sense.""  I went to see ""Unbreakable"" believing it to be at least as good as ""The Sixth Sense."" Words cannot begin to describe how much of a let-down this movie was.  It had very few redeeming qualities, and I felt dumber for having watched it (Thank you, ""Billy Madison"").  I don't understand who gave this movie good reviews, but they must be much more tolerant of c***!  If you go see this movie, make sure you're taking with you someone else to pay for it. You'll be glad that you didn't waste your own money.PS - Don't be fooled by the commercials and marketing.  The premise of this movie is so flimsy.  There are so many things wrong with this film that it's almost not even worth thinking through; you'll just end up with a headache, and it won't make any more sense.",Unbreakable
761,Athmyr,A fascinating homage,9,30 November 2000,"Unbreakable is refreshingly different.  I think I have an advantage in the fact that I've seen it, but not The Sixth Sense, so I am able to judge it on its own merits without comparing it to the director's previous endeavor.I could tell from the audience's reaction that it went over their heads. The slightly surreal lighting has been criticized by some as making everything too ""washed out."" Sigh.  These people do not get it.  It's *supposed* to be that way, to emphasize and mythicize the ordinariness of the main character's life to comic book proportions.  It's part of the homage, people!Jackson's performance is especially subtle and compelling. His character is an excellent device that attempts to explain to the audience, many of whom aren't getting it anyway, what's going on in a way that doesn't dumb the information down or condescend too much to the peanut gallery. (It's done a bit here and there, particularly with one of the last lines of Price's mother's character, but not too often.) Instead, it generally fits in perfectly with the building of his character.The movie is not without flaws. The crash flashback, I thought, could have been edited down a bit -- a bit slow in parts.  But the slow pace also works to the film's advantage.  It gradually unfolds in such a way that it makes you wonder what direction the plot will move in next.  This is not the film I expected from the trailers, and I'm delighted to say it's far more interesting.  I rather wonder what it might have been like had Terry Gilliam directed it -- probably even better.  If I had to reduce it to a ""star"" rating, I'd probably give it 3.25 - 3.50 out of 4.I plan to see it again, and that's a rare thing for me to do. If you like comic books, you'll like Unbreakable.",Unbreakable

He has a gift for telling a story. I will see this movie again in the theatre. I loved the aspect or position M. Night takes in telling this story.

But just because it was written well, doesn't mean it was a good movie.  I saw this film, and from the beginning noticed that the cinematographer was trying a little too hard with some scenes to give a view of ""Look at the talents I have.""I can understand that, but it was much more subtle and well-done in The Sixth Sense.  Also, the movie tends to drag out, like a large novel.  My personal interest only peaked during the last quarter of the movie, and sharply dropped in the last 30 seconds before the credits rolled.   (If you see it, I think you'll understand why these 30 seconds should have just been cut out, and left the story hanging)The plot is complex, so complex in fact, that it takes 3/4 of the movie to establish just what is going on, without it sounding cheesy.I was looking forward to this movie mainly because the trailer was excellently mysterious, and because M.

I noticed that all the intelligent people raved about the film, saying how wonderful it was, while the less cerebral people said it was just okay.  That's the thing with this one-you need a brain to enjoy it.  When someone asked me how I liked the movie, I simply replied, ""It was the best F@#$ing film I've seen all year."" And it was.  While Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense""  was superb in every way, it didn't throw me on my ass quite like this one did.

Jackson gets a little dull and confusing, but there's one hell of a twist (of course) at the end.  Spencer Treat Clark (who was one of the great kid actors of soaps) is also very believable as his loving and supportive son.  Watch for the really corny symbolism in the climactic fight scene.

Much like a comicbook with its little squares.As in comicbooks sometimes you don't need the dialogue for the story to be told. Here the story is told through the movment of the camera, people only speak when it is required that they do so. Here the story tells itself, and in that shows us that Mr. Shyamalan has become even better at storytelling, although he has yet to find the perfect way to end, perhaps he might try just letting it be. These characters, people, end too soon the lives they begin to learn. It came sudden, too fast to focus on the rest. When the rest of the movie was slow and deliberate the end cut it short, as if he were impatient to really get the point across. Those people who said that this movie was a downturn from The Sixth Sense should watch Unbreakable again and see what they missed the first time.

Don't take it that I dislike the genre of fantasy (I loved X-Men), but I like it to be visibly so, without pretencions of psychological depth and insight, this simply felt extremely underwhelming.Even though the film is very disappointing from a plot perspective, the camerawork is impressive in general with several particularly nice shots (especially through the billowing curtains in the bedroom scene). Bruce Willis is reasonable as the brooding David, basically re-enacting the role from the sixth sense, of a man with an uncertain past needing to participate in a voyage of self discovery before he can realize his destiny.It lulled me into a sense of expectation from trailers, posters and the Sixth Sense, which it then unfortunately betrayed by being a film that was shallow and unengaging.

Bruce Willis also does good, which is due to Shyamalan, showing he does excellent directing with actors, he knows how to make them give their best performance. But what is really admirable about this movie, is that Shyamalan, with the success of The Sixth Sense, had the liberty to make any kind of movie he wanted. In every second of the movie, you notice Shyamalan's passion for comics. Just ask comics fans, everyone I know who loves comics (myself included), LOVED the movie.

788,ryanbsmith,Brilliant,10,13 February 2002,"I believe 'Unbreakable' is a brilliant film.  And instead of saying ""it's great! go see it!"", I have provided evidence as to why I feel this way.Screenplay: People complain these days that most movies are too much alike, that there is a lack of creativity.  This film breaks the mold and delivers a story of how comic book heroes and villains come to be, and does so flawlessly in my opinion.  'Unbreakable' explains the physical attributes, ""special powers"", weaknesses, motivation, and even the costumes that characterize the hero and the villain in a comic book.  And it is all done in a dramatic, fascinating way.  There's your creativity right there.
Cinematography: Few directors take advantage of the camera as well as M. Night does, and throughout this film I am in awe of how artistically he puts it to use.  Why just point and shoot when you can interact with the characters and the audience?Acting: Bruce Willis is excellent in this film, as was he in 'Sixth Sense'. I am happy to see him breaking out of his stereotype and performing well in more serious roles.  And Samuel L. Jackson was perfect as Mr. Glass, he looked purely evil.Why would anybody want 'Unbreakable' to be another comic book movie filled with action?  There are hundreds of movies already out there that will satisfy that desire.  Take your pick: Superman, Batman, Spawn, X-Men, Blade... need I go on?  Watch one of those if you are in the mood for action and excitement.  If you don't like ""slow"" movies, then what that means is you typically don't like dramas... so don't see 'Unbreakable' and then whine about it being ""slow"".  This film provides a truely unique moviegoing experience.  Toss aside any ideas of what you think it should be and allow it to command your attention.  You won't be sorry.",Unbreakable

He seems to be constantly depressed and detached, without knowing why.  Problem is, I lost track and interest, as he detached my interest as well.Once it picks up, and Samuel L. Jackson sort of pulls us back into the film by explaining it's premise, and while I like the overall concept, the die had already been cast.  I think this is probably the reason this movie did not get the good reviews and word of mouth that the other two flicks did. I also think that the comic-book theme of this movie, while quite interesting to those who know of this field and subculture, will certainly cause the average movie-goer, and even reviewer, to lose interest.  All in all a good, but not great, less than satisfying experience.",Unbreakable
792,trapper-hell,The extents that insanity can lead to...,8,4 July 2009,"This is the second time I've watched this movie, and now I can be sure that I've understood it well... I must say that I have enjoyed this movie quite a lot! I was surprised to find out that M. Night Shyamalan produced this movie - since it's not the usual genre of horror - however it does contain elements of suspense. This was an original and cool depiction of the usual Good vs. Evil.With regards to the good aspects of this movie, there is of course the time line and the plot. The actors were great too! Samuel L. Jackson performed wonderfully! The twist near the ending is also great amongst various other characteristics.I only found a few negative aspects which include the lack of 'testing' to the possibility of David Dunn being a 'hero'. Furthermore even though the ending was commented, there is lack of action and depiction of what was about to happen next.I can now only say that this is a great movie and worth watching :)",Unbreakable
793,Muniba Mastani,Almost Unbearable,4,12 March 2002,"After 6th sense, I had great respect for M.Night Shyamalan. With Unbreakable, methinks he has become rather self indulgent. The sole saving grace of the film is it's end. When Samuel L. Jackson turns out to be the evil genius. The twist in the surreal tale is brilliant to say the least, even better than that of SS, but whereas SS took you along on the most enjoyable ghost ride ever, Unbreakable drags. I watched the film in three painful sittings. Bruce Willis was awful as the super hero who doesn't know what a superb specimen of humanity he really is. He moved slowly, talked slowly and his whinging wife was just the icing on the cake. Whereas it worked when he played a ghost, it doesn't for his Superman in jeans. The only good thing in the film was Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah. I loved the hairdo and the suits. Shyamalan knows how to paint a picture in his own beautiful way, but can he give a story the colours it really needs like, well, that master of all masters Scorcese. I mean, Cape Fear and Casino has nothing in common, but Unbreakable was Willis sleepwalking back to life from the dead, if you know what I mean...",Unbreakable
794,DavidFincher,A Work of Art,10,29 April 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan is nothing less than a genius, among the ranks of Hitchcock and Kurosawa. He shows us why film can be considered an art form.One's enjoyment is heightened if he/she is a comic fan. This movie is simply a real life comic book. So an interest or knowledge helps, but is not imparitive. The fact is, this movie is terrific, and gets better with each viewing. I watched it for probably the 10th time last night, and I was glued to my seat. Fantastic. A must see. All of Shyamalan's films are an extraordinary event that he translates to real life. Instead of alien invasions or the dead coming to life, this story follows a real life superhero.",Unbreakable
795,stu_locorp,Are you ready for the truth?,10,10 November 2002,"SUMMARYFollowing his immense success of ""The Sixth Sense"", director M. Night Shyamalan gives an entirely different kind of story here as there are no ghosts to be found anywhere in this tale. Here we meet a man who appears on the surface to be a regular working guy with no real special traits about him at all named David Dunne (played by Bruce Willis from ""Die Hard"" and ""The Sixth Sense""). Dunne's life is not what it used to be, he is estranged from his wife while still living in the same house trying to look after his son Jeremy (played by Spencer Treat Clark from """"). Everything changes when he is the only survivor of a massive train wreak and comes into the company of a bizarre individual named Elijah Price (played by Samuel L. Jackson from ""True Romance"" and ""The Caveman's Valentine"").REVIEWHaving your first major theatrically released film gross more than $600 million dollars world wide can be considered to be both a curse as well as a blessing. On one hand, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan had no trouble in securing another project and being given the freedom to do it, the other side of the coin was that everyone expected him to top that first film, ""The Sixth Sense"". The problem being, beside the fact that ""The Sixth Sense"" was a masterful feature, it was also a fluke among Hollywood and made the majority of its money based on word of mouth as well as the publics ability keep the secret of the ending in tact. This is an unfair thing to do to anyone as there is absolutely no way of knowing exactly how the public is going to react to a movie no matter how hard you try and market it. ""Unbreakable"" was aided by having the perfect example of how a trailer should be made. It gave us a glimpse at a few characters, showed us some intense looking scenes aboard the train and then only the masterful dialogue as spoken by Samuel L. Jackson to close us out. It was deeply intriguing, while at the same time it gave away nothing so far as important plot points went. It must be stressed here that ""Unbreakable"" is nothing at all like ""The Sixth Sense"" and anyone coming into it hoping of a little more of the same overall are going to be horribly disappointed.""Unbreakable"" is not the kind of movie that is made very often anymore, a deep story that manages to involve a certain element of fantasy while still never moving to far away from events that we believe actually could happen. What we have here is a super-hero movie, one where there is no one who wears a cape, there are no tights and no one shoots lasers from their finger tips. Perhaps a few aspects of ""Unbreakable"" were a little to subtle for its own good, just perhaps it tried to be a little to clever for a mass audience. When you sit back afterwards, when the ending sinks in and you think back to all the many clues that lead to that point it will hit you how brilliant this screenplay was. It is so easy to miss something because a times ""Unbreakable"" is rather light on dialogue instead relying on scenery, gestures or facial expressions to get a point across. Without a doubt it forces you to pay attention and while some people complain the pace is a little to slow it was necessary to get from one point to another.Being so subtle and trying to make such a fine point about the relevance about comic books is bound to elicit strong emotions from people who see this one. Essentially you will be very likely to either love it or seriously hate it for a multitude of reasons. If you were a comic book fanatic when you were a child then this movie just might mean a little something more to you than it will to other people who ""just wont get"" certain parts. It is not a fast movie, it takes its time in telling the story and it does run just under two hours in length, but could only really have been shortened by five minutes at a maximum. If you are looking for a ""Batman"", ""Spider Man"" or other like super-hero movies then this one might not be your cup of tea.The second time around with Bruce Willis with M. Night Shyamalan is decidedly better than his first trip. Being one of the weaker elements of ""The Sixth Sense"" in that he was completely outshone by young Haley Joel Osment. This time around he is the star, rising a few levels above even the master himself, Samuel L. Jackson. Willis is spot on here as the everyman hero, the poor father who works at a virtually dead end job doing something that he cannot at first understand why he has gotten himself into. As we see him slowly begin to learn his place in the world it means a lot more because we have spent the time to get to know him and his life before anything thrilling takes place. ""Unbreakable"" is a rewarding experience if you give it the chance to soak in and appreciate its finer details.",Unbreakable

We can say that this is another superhuman movie but what makes it different from others is its realistic touch. Samuel L. Jackson did an incredibly good job.I also would like to comment on Elijah's role. He is suffering from a rare bone disease but at the same time he is quite brilliant. I think his mother is the biggest culprit in the whole story. She ruined her child's life by giving him nothing else to read other than comics. People are not born to do good or evil things. People get different abilities and powers that they can utilize in a good or bad way. Elijah could have excelled in scholarly discipline with the God gifted brilliant mind he had but his mother and to some extent surroundings induced in him inferiority complex and he turned into a criminal. He just read comics and started thinking about everything in terms of comic characters. Anyway, the movie was really a good drama.",Unbreakable
798,duibe,Unwatchable,1,15 May 2003,"A terrible film in almost every respect, Shyamalan has crafted an utterly unwatchable movie.  With great packaging and an intriguing premise, this stinker lured unsuspecting audiences into theatres in 2000.  However, within the first fifteen minutes, audible groans echoed throughout the theater. Half the audience remained at the final reel. This picture really sucks. Bruce Willis' lethargic performance is boring to watch, and the supporting cast, including Samuel Jackson, struggle through the meandering, directionless script.  The film moves at a sluggish pace, which is fine within Shyamalan's noirish mise en'scene, but the script is downright awful, therefore it's pacing is unjustifed.  An example- when Willis' kid tests his father's invincibility by pointing a weapon at him.  This scene is ridiculously awful and carelessly directed.  It was totally unconvincing and over-the-top.  I've seen more fully realized scenes in student films.  Or how about the ""shocking climax?"" I can't believe it took two hours of such utter nonsense to build up to this weak, uneven revelation.  It was particularly sad because Shyamalan obviously set everything up for a sequel, but when audiences saw this turd, plans were scrapped by the studio. Yes, I don't think ""Unbreakable II"" will ever see the light of day, thank God. So if you feel like wasting two hours of your time on a Sunday afternoon..... still avoid this movie; watch something more appetizing, like ""Signs"" or ""Die Hard.""",Unbreakable
799,mycranium,Staying Power,8,13 June 2003,"While I was watching this movie I got irritated at the slow, ponderous style in which it was shot. I understood that Mr. Shyamalan wanted to take a subject normally rendered in four colors on newsprint and treat its character implications in a more serious manner, but I thought he was overcompensating with the super-slow, long single-take scenes. But I enjoyed the story, and the acting was wonderful so I went with it. When it ended I regarded it as being not terribly good, but having some interesting aspects.I'm writing this the day after I saw it, and I realize now how affecting the film was. I now see it as a great film with a few minor pacing flaws. If you have the patience for it, the style of the film is hypnotic and it really enhances the emotional connection to the characters. This film has really stuck with me in ways I didn't expect.Bruce Willis has done a lot of roles where he's cocky and swaggering, and those tend to overshadow his more serious work. I have enjoyed his performances for a long time, and I'll dare to say that he's not merely a movie star, he's one of our time's finest actors. He has great range and is willing to portray vulnerability, the effect of which is heightened by his normally confident smirkiness. He is also willing to take risks in the roles he accepts, balancing the big-budget popcorn movies with nice character work. His portrayal of the stoic, sad lead character in this film is understated and powerful.Samuel L. Jackson is hit-or-miss for me. I think he's too content to skate by on persona. In some films it seems like he's barely learned his lines (xXx for example). Lately though, I've seen him in some roles that are more challenging (The Caveman's Valentine, The Red Violin) and I'm raising my opinion of him. I really enjoyed his performance in this movie.Robin Wright Penn is outstanding. That's really no surprise.If you've avoided seeing this movie because of the reviews it got when it was released, you should consider giving it a chance. Yes, you can expect it to be slow, but if you accept that going into it you may discover that it has some emotional depth and staying power.",Unbreakable

The problem with this guy is that he insist at the absence of visual effects in his films. This would be fine with me if he didn't insist of making sci-fi movies. Why didn't he try Bollywood? At least people wouldn't waste any money on craps. What else can you describe a movie that presents us the ultimate fight between good and evil, using absolutely NO visual effects to back it up. I mean the script refers to a guy with superhuman powers battling a master villain. Any usaspected person would fall for that, but be worn......all you gonna see is people talking to people(and above all with lousy actoring).

I was amazed at how easily this movie managed to demean even an amazing actor like S L Jackson!

I recently saw the Directors 3rd big budget movie 'Signs' which I found to be much better, though still no great shakes. I feel his work is overrated.... I am very hesitant about buying 'The Village' now after 3 very average and over-hyped movies... Although, I will give it the benefit of the doubt as I am a fan of Sigourney Weaver.

The characters all seem to be on tranquilisers, their reactions don't make much sense, and anyway I don't find myself caring about any of them. Maybe if it were an Ingmar Bergman film I would at least have had the right expectations, it certainly isn't a typical Bruce Willis film - not only due to the lack of action, but also the total lack of humour. The ending is vaguely OK but not worth the wait.Having watched the film I decided to have a look at the IMDb reviews, and I'm a little baffled to see so many reviews saying that it's great.

Until I saw Scary Movie III last night on TBS, where the commercial breaks are longer than the program segments. That gave me time to think. The parody OF Signs was FAR better than the original, which now seems totally contrived and pointless, but harmless.Not so, this film! Unbreakable is deliberately, pointedly awful. From original concept, right down to the most insipid minor characterization! Someone, somewhere below wrote something about building suspense and characterization. HARDLY! What builds is the terrible job of audio recording, the ""steal something from every master director"" approach of the incompetent writer/producer/director, and the sense that Bruce Willis probably washed his hands after each ""cut"" was called. This is a nasty little film that takes the plot of ""Breathless"" (now #2 worst movie I have ever made it through...) and collapses it even further inward on its vacuous self.This film says nothing, portrays nothing, except the empty self-absorption of everyone in it, except Willis, who comes to accept their dilemmas and fall victim to them himself. No WONDER he's depressed! He's married to a woman who sees her life's mission as saving people...from football injuries! And that's just the EASIEST of the characterizations to grasp!

810,KeyserSoze007,Unnecessary obsession ruins otherwise great film.,4,26 November 2000,"I was excited to see this film.  I was a great admirer of The Sixth Sense and was enticed by the trailer.  However, what I hoped would be another hit for director/writer/producer M. Night Shyamalan was destroyed by unintentional camp provided by someone's obsession with comic books.Yes, comic books. The film is about comic books.  This is NOT a spoiler for it, considering the first two minutes of the film is a brief statistical summary of comic books and their popularity in America.  From the start, the story is sickeningly predictable.  The only aspect not telegraphed from miles away is the ending, which is a good one, although grossly illogical.Unfortunately, the whole thing is so predictable that even by the time the surprise twist rolls around, the damage has been done.The acting in Unbreakable is one of the two major redeeming qualities. Bruce Willis gives a great performance as the confused survivor of two major accidents and Samuel L. Jackson is also very good as an obsessed comic book collector.The other aspect of this film worth noting is the cinematography, which is first-rate.  Flashbacks have never looked so good or terrifying.The bottom line is that if you can get over the sadly campy comic book elements, you will enjoy this movie. One final thing must be noted: this film proves that Shymalan is a very formulaic writer.  In other words, if you played The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable at the same time, the same things happen at the same time.  It is as if Unbreakable was tacked onto the existing script of The Sixth Sense.  Unless you're willing to consider the artistic nature of this film, don't bother. RATING: 4",Unbreakable
811,domnogin,A worthy sophomore product,9,15 July 2006,"The real gem of the movie isn't the heroics or the juxtaposition of past & present; it is the shifting relationships. The hero's relationship with his wife, his son, and with the mysterious Elijah are all very different at the end of the movie than at the beginning. Even his understanding of who he can be shifts dramatically. Sure, Elijah's exposition of the nature of comic book characters is awkward at times, but even that is necessary for audience members not fluent in mythologies ancient or modern. The barbell scene is a scream; the director's appearance as a suspect in the second act rivals Hitchcock's cameos in his own movies.

Everyone thinks they are a film critic in this country and they have not a clue what they are talking about. Ok, maybe it didn't have the shocking twist that The Sixth Sense had but it was definitely a good twist. There were many clues during the film too that indicate Samuel L. Jackson's intentions, but I won't give that away. The film also had some awesome camera shots as well as long, uninterrupted takes. Not many people seem to appreciate that though.

This film is an utter success inandof the fact that M. Night Shyamalan has used his current celebrity to launch a film with a viable artistic intent into the public eye. The movie, based on the comic book form, takes an interesting stance on hypertextuality and the connection between film and comic book. A superhero story, Shyamalan abolishes the archetypal action and pacing of such in much the same way as he breaks free from the square frames on a comic's page. His visuals bringing Bruce Willis' superpower to the screen make it clear that he has a definitive purpose in the hypermediation of his film. Dialogue, details, and characters are beautifully engineered and performed with perfect understanding and symbolism from Shyamalan's artistic focal point. It is truly a beauty to behold. Those who criticise its slow sequences, take a step back and involve yourself with the comic-book-page coloration, slow pans in the stead of the white bars between pans, and incredible acting of the entire cast. Yes, it's better than the Sixth Sense. But don't expect a thriller. Shyamalan has broken free of the Hollywood standard of directing movies. It might be offensive to some critics that some sequences are slower, but the more slowly they pass, the more rich with Shymalan's directorial art they are. We can only hope that the critical ignorance of this film will not sway Shaymalan's motives in the future, and he will continue bringing his wonderful, viable artistic motives to his wide audience.

I thought The Sixth Sense was excellent.  But, despite the fact that the two movies were fairly similar, they still can't be compared.  And in my opinion, they shouldn't be compared.  This movie was fascinating to me in the way the main character (David Dunn) comes to realize that he is capable of incredible potential.  He goes through a sort of ""midlife crisis"" -- a self-realization.  Also, the story and plot isn't dumbed down like in most comic book movies, which is a huge relief.  And the fact that the movie takes place in the REAL WORLD enhances the overall effect.  Our hero isn't placed in a ""Gotham City"" or some other alternate universe, but instead is thrown into the mix with our everyday society -- in real situations.Even though I loved this movie, I still would be cautious in recommending it to others.  It isn't a movie for everyone.  Some will be disappointed, no doubt.  While I thought the character development was paced just about right, some will think it really drags out.

818,JLM-7,Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson prove what a great team they make and M.Night Shymalan redeems himself,10,27 June 2001,"I went into this movie being VERY VERY skeptical, because I was one of the few who HATED The Sixth Sense. I thought that movie was boring, predictable and just plain badly executed. While the actors did give great performances, the movie, I felt, didn't handle it's subject matter properly, and was paced too slowly. It gave me a poor outlook on any other of Shymalan's films.With Unbreakable, Shymalan managed to erase that stigma, and prove that he can make a wonderful and compelling film. The handling of the subject matter in this film is just undeniably superb. There are no loose ends left lying around like Sixth Sense. This is the story of a normal guy who struggles to believe that he's a little more extraordinary then the rest of us. Halfway through the Sixth Sense, I'd figured the ending out and was ready to shut it off, with this movie, while I did figure the ending out fairly early, I still couldn't take my eyes from the screen, wanting to see EXACTLY WHY the characters did what they felt compelled to do. The film begins at a qick pace and just picks up speed along the way culminating in a wonderful and exciting (if not slightly predictable)climax. Add to this the fact that Bruce Willis once again proves how underrated he is as a great and versatile actor. Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, simply amazing. The two who first teamed together on Die Hard With A Vengeance, proved that they did indeed make that film watchable time after time. Even if you're not a fan of this movie, watch it just once more to see how well these two play off of each other. This film is a true masterpiece and is in my mind a modern classic, far superior to Sixth Sense in every way, and a much more emotionally powerful film as well. The struggles with in David Dunn himself and within his family are just amazingly intense, yet reassuring scenes. I can say proudly for the first time now that M. Night Shymalan has the potential to be one of the greatest storytellers of our time. I thank him for such a great and memorable story.",Unbreakable
819,saxtouri,"Bad story, great philosophical idea!",8,6 February 2001,"(-----------CONTAINS SPOILERS--------)Nobody can avoid the comparison with sixth sense, neither me. And I have to admit that the plot was better in 6th sense. Unbreakable's story is full of ""gaps"". For example, Willis hasn't ever been sick or injured in his entire life but he hasn't notice the fact yet! He believes that he was injured on a car accident, but when Jackson tell's him he wasn't, he admit with surprise it's true! He didn't know if he was injured or not? So, why do I believe that Unbreakable is better than 6th sense? It's the idea behind the story, something that was missing in sixth sense. 6th sense was just a game between the director and the audience. And everything was the ending. In unbreakable, the audience is expecting the same: a not-so-interesting main story, that is completely changed by the final scene. And the bet is that the director should find an even more surprising ending. He failed. But he succed something else.The not-so-interesting story becomes a dialectic philosophical thought: you are the opposite of your opposite. Your opposite defines you. You exist because your opposite also exists. And if you cannot find your opposite, you have two solutions: die or create it!Jackson creates his opposite by a man who is led by the facts out of him. Willis is not a good person, he is absolutely neutral. Of course he is unbreakable, but he doesn't know it, so he is not! He has found his place around the average, because the average doesn't need an opposite: it the opposite itself. But Jackson knows that he is the unlucky guy, so it must exist a lucky, good, perfect one, to define his existance. So he finds Willis and gradualy transforms him into the perfect opposite of himself.The most amasing is that Jackson is being transformed into a bad, evil guy, while he is seeking for Willis. He kills people to find the one who will save them.On the other hand, Jackson was realy very week, physicaly I mean, and Willis was realy unbreakable (but he didn't want to admit it). The line with the edges exists, but somebody should reveal it. Or did Jackson created?

820,snapdggler,Deep Movie disguised as a fantasy,9,26 November 2000,"Okay, first of all let me say I was surprised when I saw both end of the spectrum reviews for this movie. Either you loved it or you hated it, there's no middle ground, apparently. Either you've written it off as a take off on his own Sixth Sense for Shamayalan or you're convinced he made a star vehicle with a twist ending and a fantastical view on ""superheroes"".Bruce Willis plays a former football star security guard who is distant from his wife (The amazing but underused Robin Wright Penn) and his kid (that kid from something u've seen, but no it's Not Haley Joel and besides the GUn scene which is more writing than acting, this kid aint close either). When he is the only one to survive a tragic train crash, he is approached by a comic book art dealer named Elijah (Samuel L Jackson) or Mr Glass growing up because of his disorder which makes his bones brittle and easily broken.The movie is out there. It's not Sixth Sense but it doesn't try to be. It does have a theme of ""extraordianry"" humans helping otehrs as Sixth Sense did, but no one is dead and beyond that the and Willis *and Night* the similarities end there. The movie paces slowly in the beginning and then ends rapidly, with title cards giving away the final aspects. This wasn't a documentary, that wasn't necessary. The ending, while a cool twist that adds more depth to the film, feels rushed and forced as if Night said ""hey awesome set up, oh no, where do I go now""?But I liked it. It entertained me and I thought Willis gave an Oscar Worthy understated performance to Jackson's more over the top approach to his. This film is not a horror/shock film like Sense, this is strictly fantasy in a...realistic comic book way. It's like a 3 star movie that cleans up cause of its acting chops.",Unbreakable

(Hence the lame attempt at a pick-up in the opening scene on the train: he's not a bad man; he's just a bored man.]Enter Jackson's character:  the large headed freaky exaggeration of a man [a cartoon?] a DIVERSION!.At first Jackson elicits empathy.  Later we are 'led' to believe he has fulfilled his destiny, perhaps even found a cure for his own ills through his opposite, his inverse, his 'negative' image.Destiny is certainly a part, but a cure is not what he seeks.  Jackson is the author of this short story in square boxes and it is Jackson who gets all that he seeks.  He allows Willis to take a small step towards his destiny.  But, from his wheelchair, Jackson achieves more.  Jackson is working from familiar turf, lame, incapacitated, a place he's been all of his life, from birth.  Willis' is forced to tread unfamiliar water.Jackson is bored too and needs a DIVERSION:  enter everyman.

It was all smoke and mirrors; made to trick you into thinking something different from the painfully obvious truth was going on. This movie, on the other hand, is brilliant from frame 1. The way the shots are framed, the completely accurate references to comic books (yes, I AM a comic book fan), the journey the characters take, its all very well developed. Some complain this movie is too slow. I found it completely engrossing. OK, maybe the last 2 seconds of the film were lame, but its 2 seconds, and its teletype (don't worry, I didn't spoil anything. ""OH MY GOD! TELETYPE! YOU JUST RUINED IT!"") At any rate, I found it brilliantly acted, AMAZINGLY directed (M.

This certainly isn't that - it's adolescent nonsense, which is great if that's what you want, but if you want the type of film that this claims to be (popular genre but serious, grown-up content beautifully shot)then go and see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""instead.",Unbreakable

Some commentators have accused M. Night Shyamalan of being on one track, or trying to make another 6th Sense.  The two films do share some similar themes of self discovery and supernatural possibilities (and Bruce Willis), but Shyamalan is obviously interested in these themes, so why shouldn't he make films that explore them?  He does a brilliant job of it.I guess it's not everyone's cup of tea - it isn't an action packed ride, and I suppose that some people would hear of it's association with comic books and have expectations that wouldn't be met.  But to anyone who likes a movie that makes you wonder, ""what if?"", I say, check it out.  As Samuel L.

828,marchy,Beats the Sixth Sense,9,20 January 2001,"What a career Night Shyamalan has ahead of him. The imagination of the man is incredible. To create two slow-burning, superbly-acted, thoroughly indulging masterpieces in the Sixth Sense and now Unbreakable, is a superb feat for a director so young, but to leave the viewers speechless at the last moment in both cases with twists that, while astounding, are not beyond belief, shows signs of genius. Few directors can make the viewer _need_ to see a film a second time, to retrace their steps and see what they missed, but this man can.As with the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable will not be to everyone's taste, and a 12 certificate is perhaps unjustified as younger viewers may become impatient with the film's undeniably steady, ponderous pace and lack of the comic book action perhaps expected from the summaries. But what makes the movie so captivating is its intelligence and attention to detail - the numerous comparisons to comics, such as those concerning characters' personalities and appearances and the intuitive camera angles put to use by this original, resourceful director. Subtle injections of humour, moments to make the viewers take notice (such as Shyamalan's cameo) and his trademark sudden, shocking bursts of music and/or visual effects punctuate the story superbly.Acting is top-notch - Bruce Willis once again proves his range stretches beyond decking bad guys as David Dunn, the uncomprehending hero, while Spencer Treat Clark gives another very credible performance which in my opinion matches the occasionally whiny Haley Joel Osment, and the gorgeous Robin Wright Penn performs excellently as Willis' wife. Of course Samuel L. Jackson puts in a dazzling show as the mysterious Elijah - one of his trademark rants appears, at an art gallery customer, and is hilarious.Of course, the twist must be mentioned - like the Sixth Sense, if one gives the film 100% attention it is perhaps able to be foreseen but still leaves the viewer open-mouthed when it happens. Contrary to reports, it is perfectly believable and fulfilling - had the film ended without it, in my opinion one key part of the storyline wouldn't have been at all concluded, that being, why and how Elijah ever came across David. But of course, it all makes sense when the credits roll, and though I am usually disappointed by films which end with a wrap-up in the form of text, there's always an exception to the rule.9/10",Unbreakable
829,mario24,Good Film,8,26 November 2000,A good all around film with solid acting.

831,Tanya Wabbit,an original film that lacks substance,8,26 July 2001,"Unbreakable has fresh and interesting ideas, too bad there isn't enough story for it to be worth its length. I liked the slow pace in the beginning, but then the film never picked up speed.The problem seems to be that Shyamalan focuses too hard on creating his own style (colours and surprising ending). (IMHO) Unbreakable would have been better off getting rid of all the filler scenes, shove the ""surprise ending"" to the middle of the story-telling, and begin the climax/action from there. (There's certainly enough time to fit in a sequel or two!)
******Spoilers!!***************The hero and villain relationship in Unbreakable is certainly original. Elijah wouldn't have been a villain if he wasn't looking for the superhero, and Dave wouldn't have been a superhero if Elijah hadn't given him pointers and derailed the train.

To me this movie was something like the Usual Suspects. You had to sit through to the end to understand it's actual greatness.  I will agree that Unbreakable doesn't jump out and hit you with the obvious at the end like Usual Suspects does ( and I hope to God that they don't make a Usual Suspects 2 like I hear that they are planning.)  Unbreakable I was thrilled by because it's the story of a villian making a superhero.  Most comics deal with how heroes like Batman, or Spiderman create villians who have a vendetta out against them.  This movie cleverly twist that around and makes a persons search for a superhero changes him to a villian and through this search he creates a super hero. Wow!",Unbreakable

Films with substance. Shyamalan attempts to recreate the formula that has made his name. Fabulous cinematography and a low key Willis performance are the only similarities between ""The Sixth Sense"" and this fast buck vehicle. The main thing that seems missing is the sincerity of his previous effort. As far as the comparisons I've read on this site between M. Night Shyamalan and A. H.(""THE"" Master Of Suspense), come on get real-Alfred could whip him with one hand. It's not a bad thing that M. Night has decided to try to emulate Hitchcock, his use of colors in ""The  Sixth Sense"" was commendable. I've all but forgotten those images due to some of the heavy-handed, ultra-saturated, super-slick ""effects"" present in ""Unbreakable"". Now, back to the twist-it just didn't work here. It seemed forced. A plot twist should fit integrally to tie up loose ends, perhaps explain things, not just be pasted on at the end because that's what worked last time.

It immediately follows the darkest part of the movie which already ends with a form of resolution for all characters concerned.For me personally, the need to go 'Sixth Sensy' with a twist-at-the-end managed to break 'Unbreakable', right at the very end. The camera work, art direction and acting is superb up to that point.

But, man, this time, he REALLY missed his goal, and trust me, he will NOT get another $10 milion + for his next project or I'm out of here. Unbreakable is certainly nicely photographed and loaded with an amazing sound design, but this is supposed to be a MOTION picture, not a slides show with a nice digital sound background. Unbreakable is unbelievable, poorly written, unbearably slow, pretty much senseless AND pointless, for it is (very) loosely based on a weak plot made of comic books memorabilia and vague issues. Worst, Bruce W occasionally articulates some fuzzy phrases out of his static mouth, but that's it, talk about a paper-thin character!On the other hand, I really liked Samuel L. Jackson mean spirited, aggressive, edgy character, that nobody will root for, but, hey, doesn't the audience love to hate? Besides that, I could not care less about the overrated G versus E stuff, which at least shows that M. Night Shyamalan lacks of real directorial skills, and is completely unable to give consistency and basic believability to such a common, linear plot. Where he shows his great craft in cinematography and original (but sometimes lengthy) shots, he fails in lifting his already fragile story structure with real, consistent characters, all of them who end being trapped in the plot numerous potholes.Eventually, this movie lacks emotion, real conflict, developed characters (not those paperboard ones, save for Elijah) and A PLOT, for Pete's sake. Where IS the FULL plot??? What the heck is going on here? After 30 minutes, everything comes together, every action becomes annoyingly predictable or redundant, Bruce W. keeps mumbling and giving us this absurd spaniel-like moist, worried look.

At the end, you realize that ""Unbreakable"" was just setting the scene for ""Unbreakable 2"".Regardless of its faults though, ""Unbreakable"" does have its moments. It is just awesome visually. Also, it's unpredictable on a very basic level; you genuinely don't know what is going to happen next (or if you do know what's going to happen, you don't know HOW it's going to happen).So... it's a mixed bag, I guess.

It is a story about finding what your true worth and true potential is in life - not just about David Dunn finding out he has powers.A must to enjoy this movie is to accept it's slow, deliberate pace. Remember, Dunn's life is slow and plodding.  The movie's pace picks up as Dunn's life does.  Makes you FEEL his agony during it's slow beginning, and FEEL his self-worth as the moview picks up it's pace.  Oh yeah, you need to be able to let your imagination fly.

This is an artistic film, and even the camera angles are interesting. Unbreakable is an explicit tribute to popular US comic book art and the the vast underground subculture of loyal comic fans, while simultaneously an implicit indictment of the naive hero worship that we all inevitably fall into. Shyamalan uses common, everyday situations to open the doors of our imagination and slowly pull us into the depths of his sentimental psyche. Shyamalan's greatest strength is his innate sensitivity and understanding of ordinary human interactions. Every relationship and every conversation in this movie has a purpose, without seeming contrived. Shyamalan is a modern writer/director, and sometimes his scenes seem plodding, but every scene is a necessary step toward the ultimate truth. My suggestion is to watch this movie with no expectations, fully understanding that the film is filled with symbolism and metaphors.

849,GunZblaZin,Expect the Unexpected,10,4 November 2002,"Welcome to writer-director-and producer M.Night Shyamalan's world of hushed silence, where the mystery is heightened by whispers that echoes through a dark world filled with questionable riddles and intriguing questions.Shyamalan knows how to tell a story. Actually he knows more than that. He knows how to make a good, entertaining and thought provoking film. He stunned audiences world-wide with his ingeniously brainy The Sixth Sense, and now delivers Unbreakable, an equally challenging thriller.Bruce Willis plays a Security guard and soul survivor of a train crash. When he is contacted by Elijah (Samuel.L.Jackson), a comic book specialist who is nicknamed ""Mr.Glass"" due to his ""breakable"" bones, a strange plot starts to unravel.The story focuses on the dynamics between two characters who are, according to Elijah, at ""opposite ends of the spectrum"". The one is ""Unbreakable"" who survives many disasters, the other is ""Breakable"", a victim of the smallest disaster.It is interesting how Shyamalan uses colour throughout the story to illustrate and underscore the different worlds: the world and clothes of Willis' character are bathed in subdued greens and earthy colours; Jackson's character is strongly projected through dark purple and black; and the characters who serve as a connection between the two worlds are dressed in bright reds and orange. It is almost as if there is a fusion between the world of comic books and the real world.Shyamalan explores all facets of the complex character driven story. He deals with characters we care about and understand.The set-up creates a strong line of dramatic action. We want to lift the veil of secrecy that troubles our hero and put the pieces of the puzzle together.The thorough exposition builds to an explosive confrontation between the conscious and the unconscious, the real world and fantasy, and between the opposing characters.It culminates in a mind boggling resolution with an ending that is totally unexpected, yet fully comprehensible.Unbreakable is not a sequel to Sixth Sense.

Night Shyamalan really disappointed me with this piece of garbage.  To be fair, I was sitting in the front row and was very aggravated at this, but this didn't disspell the fact that this movie didn't have a plot for the first 90 minutes. And even after that, it just sort of ended, with no resolution.  I have tried to shake this from my consciousness for years so that my future movie-going experiences are much better.
The ONLY reason I give this movie a 2 is that the acting wasn't terrible. Good casting (Willis, Jackson, Wright Penn), but couldn't make up for rediculous plot (or lack there of) I give this movie: 2/10",Unbreakable
851,steveo12251,A Paen to the Genre,10,17 April 2007,"My initial viewing of this film had me feeling impatient. The pacing is leisurely and the feeling was exacerbated by my continued dislike for Willis's ""if less is more, then doing nothing is best"" approach to acting. But as the final scene developed and the movie came to a close I was filled with remembrance of the love I had as a child for super hero comicbooks. I have subsequently come to feel this is one of my favorite movies. It is obvious that both the director and the cinematographer know and love comicbooks and this film is nothing if not a loving paen to the genre. I own it and I watch it now and then just because I love the way it makes it way to the payoff. It is gratifying to read that others have noticed that almost all of the scenes have the quality of good comicbook panel artwork. The moment that stuck in my mind from the first viewing was when Dunn climbed out of the pool and knelt momentarily at the edge. The shot of the folds of his poncho and the water dripping off of it remain to me as the pivotal artistic (pure comicbook art) and emotional (fear conquered) moment. The payoff was one of the most gratifying I have experienced in my long movie going history. To realize that I had just witnessed the 'real world' birth of a superhero and supernemesis just floored me. The payoff of ""The Sixth Sense"" left me feeling like I was a fool for not seeing it coming but the ""Unbreakable"" payoff made me feel that I had just been manipulated by masters. Now. that being said, I do feel that those who never experienced the love of superhero comicbooks may not get the payoff and call this movie 'boring'.",Unbreakable

It was just after the sixth sense and everybody was going mad for it. It didn't disappoint. I thought that the film was gripping from start to finish. The story reveals itself very deftly, and both Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis are as good as they probably ever will be. What I liked about the film is that unlike some of his more recent films, the 'twist' in Unbreakable packs a pretty big punch at the end, but it's also subtle enough so that it doesn't detract from the overall film. It also has a solid plot that keeps you interested throughout instead of just scratching your head confused, waiting for the final reel reveal.",Unbreakable

But if one would do that on Unbreakable the rest would compete with Michael Jackson's Thriller for the longest video-clip ever. After all it's a pity that actors like Bruce Willis or Samuel L.Jackson went in a film like this for we all know from a lot of different productions about their real skills. No one ever should think about what could have been done with that plot. Doing so it would lead this thinking person to grab big boxes of Kleenex do dry all the bitter tears running down over all the unused opportunities of the story.",Unbreakable

This movie is actually very straight to the point even though it doesn't feel that way. It takes very long to say something very simple. We don't need to listen to a baby cry for 10 minutes just for someone to straight up say the babies bones are broken. This movie takes a while for David to realize his powers, which we assume he's had all along. Because of this we're expected to believe that David has never noticed he hasn't been sick. He even checks with his boss just in case that he had forgot about being sick. We are also expected to believe he has never before maxed out on his bench press. Once he is convinced about his obvious superhero abilities he uses his ""bad guy detector"" powers to save a family from a murderer. After the clumsiest action scene ever, David returns home and reaffirms his son's suspicions by showing him the newspaper story of what he did. Huge spoiler alert. David discovers that Elijah, whom I haven't talked about, was causing the disasters he was researching in order to discover a superhero for whom he can be the supervillain.

Even though it's plot is interesting and unpredictable towards the end, the build-up towards that twist is very slow. All of the actors do a phenomenal jobs as their characters; Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson both play their roles perfectly. The characters are odd, yet believable. The only actors who fell short was Bruce's wife. She isn't in the movie for too long, but even when she is on screen, she comes across as kind of lifeless and boring. Acting aside, the plot itself is very interesting. Essentially, the story is about a man who survives a horrific tragedy and slowly comes to realize what amazing power he's been granted. Even though this premise is in no way fresh, the presentation is what sells it for me. Bruce's character truly comes across as someone who doesn't understand what is happening to them, which is realistic since that's how almost all of us would react if we found our we had powers. Nonetheless, Unbreakable is a solid film, if you can get past the opening 45 minutes.",Unbreakable

859,jamesclarence,A very underrated film that was way ahead of its time,10,1 August 2018,"Nowadays, ask the fans of M.Night Shyamalan's works about which films is his greatest and most of them will probably answer ""Unbreakable"", and I think they're right. This is actually a favorite of M.Night Shyamalan's out of all his work. Quentin Tarantino, one of my favorite director, also loves this film. I think that this film is very unappreciated by many critics. But first, the plot summary of the film.
SUMMARY: David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis) is a security guard at an American football stadium in Philadelphia. He is also a man who searches a meaning for his own life. He thinks he hasn't been much of a father to this son and he is having a somewhat bitter relationship with his wife. One day, while returning to his home from New York City after his job interview, the Eastrail 177 (the train where David is in) derails which lead to a fatal crash of the train with no survivor except him who after the crash is left with no any signs of injury. After the news of the train accident went public, a comic-book art dealer named Elijah Price (played by Samuel L. Jackson), who has Type I osteogenesis imperfecta which render his bones very breakable, tracks him and tries to explain to him of why his body is ""unbreakable"" (hence the title).
One of the great things about this film is that it doesn't rush in, it takes its time. This might not work for some other people but I think it makes the film great. Obviously, this film is a superhero origin film, that's why it was so ahead of its time because superhero films only started booming only at the late 2000's and early 2010's with the films such as Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy and MCU's Iron Man and Avengers. Bruce Willis did an amazing job as David Dunn because he feels so sad, somber and almost melancholic which is not something he usually play as. Samuel Jackson also did an amazing job as Elijah Price, a man who is stubborn and looks like a crazy person. Every actors and actresses in this film did a great job. But what I think is the best thing about this film is the twist at the ending. Now, spoiler alert if you have not yet watched the film because at this point in my critique, it will include some spoilers. You have been warned. 
This has one of the most amazing twist of all time and I think is a very underrated twist as most critics didn't like it. It's the fact that Elijah Price was responsible for some fatal accidents which no one survived including the Eastrail 177 crash. One thing that the film is already hinting is the color palette of this two characters. David Dunn has a green poncho for his job at the security, the walls of his house is green, his bed sheet is green, even the locker at his job is also green. Meanwhile, Elijah Price has purple walls, his clothing is purple. It doesn't affect the plot at all but Shyamalan use this as a way to hint us of what will happen. Another thing is that they don't always touch. David Dunn has the ability to know what is the crime act of the person who touches him (which Dunn always interpreted as instinct). This would makes sense because David Dunn is the perfect antithesis to Elijah Price. They're both weak to water but David Dunn is unbreakable and strong while Elijah Price is easily breakable and weak. There is a quote from Elijah's mother about the types of villains (that Elijah told her) which goes ""But he says there's always two kinds. There's the soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands and there's the real threat, the brilliant and evil archenemy who fights the hero with his mind."" This summarizes up the whole film, as well as shares the themes of ""Split"" and also sets up it's next sequel, ""Glass"" (which is yet to released by the time of this review). It's also an idea that comics uses, the villain creates the hero. Overall, I think this is a great film.",Unbreakable
860,wowfanis,"Some good stuff, some bad stuff",5,15 January 2019,"Unbreakable is the kind of movie you want to see in high school with your Philosophy teacher.You can clearly see potential in the way it's directed, showing the lack of emotions to every character in a fresh way, just for a single scene to shine (see gun).The characters aren't really defined and only have one characteristic to them which only helps with the style of the movie ""everyone might as well have been dead"". It's food for thought, for you to brainstorm how they made it at that point of not feeling anything, and that's really nice. But at the end of the day there are many movies that give you the slightest of information and excpect you to derive meaning yourself, happens in books, poems, art and music too.Furthermore, I find acrting so slow, it's really hard to be engaged. I had to constantly remind myself that seeing the boy walk down the stairs for half a minute is ""a great fresh way of directing the film"", but honestly I didn't enjoy the wait.
Overall, you can try the film, see for yourself what goes on, but beware the slow pace if you are not a fun of it, on the bright side it will give you a lot of time to think of the movie.",Unbreakable
861,kbroughton-1,Great Movie,8,27 April 2006,"Unbreakable is a film that some of its predecessors like Pulp Fiction, and the 6th Sense, builds its plot mostly around dialog. If you are wanting to see a film full of action this isn't the film for you. But if you like a movie that spends a lot of the film in character development, subtle suspense, and thought provoking then this film is a great.Is the world that we live in balanced? If you have the color white then it is balanced by black. A male balanced by female, day by night. This is one of the themes of the movie. If a person is born with a disease of very fragile bones, so fragile that the slightest tough will break them, then does his opposite exist as well. Based on the patterns of nature then it must. Another aspect that makes this film great is the filming. The movie is based on the premise of comic books, and each scenes looks as if it is captured in frames. Its like your looking at a comic but instead of it being frozen frames, there is movement. Other aspects from comics can be associated with the film as well. In most comics the super hero has a first and last name that starts with the same letter or sound. Superman was Clark Kent, Spiderman is Peter Parker, Here the heroes name is David Dunn. Comics also use color to represent main characters within the story, Mr. Glass always has the color purple, David Dunn green, and many others in the movie have a particular color scheme.This is one of my favorite films and would recommend it to any person who claims to be a movie fan. It takes you on a ride that keeps you on your seat guessing what is really true. It puts you in the world of a comic book, but seems like an everyday occurrence.",Unbreakable

863,Daisy,Surprised,9,29 November 2000,"I am truly surprised that there are so many negative comments about Unbreakable.Usually Bruce Willis' acting is too flat for my taste.  However he brings just the right amount of detachment to the portrayal of a man, David Dunn, who is just going through the motions of life, until he discovers that he is ""unbreakable.""Samuel L. Jackson delivers an amazing performance as Elijah Price, a frail comic book collector searching for his ""reason for being."" Price philosophises about comic books representing the mythic archetypal dualities of our common human experience, good/evil, strong/weak, unbreakable/fragile...If I must criticise, I would say that there were several threads in the story that were not fully developed, for example, Dunn's relationship with his family. Yet the telling of the central theme of Good vs. Evil was so artfully done, one will hardly notice.Unbreakable is a simple, age-old story.  It is well told, and well worth seeing.",Unbreakable

Unbreakable is a magnificent film. The slow buildup of hints to the story, the superb acting, and a pacing that reminded me of film noir classics.People need to stop comparing it to Sixth Sense.

Sixth Sense was a hard act to follow, but Unbreakable triumphs beautifully. Intriguing and puzzling from the first frame, this movie pairs Bruce Willis with the incredible Samuel L. Jackson. How can you not be interested?There is a heavy atmosphere, a foreboding feel to Unbreakable that Willis' perfectly underplayed character (David Dunn) seems to wallow in. Next to him, Jackson (Elijah Price) is driven, obsessed. For a good portion of the movie, you won't have a clue what's going on... and after that your guesses are likely to be wrong anyway. The director shows us everything, and yet the key to whole story doesn't sink in till it's nearly over.This is very much created for the thinkers in the audience, and long after you leave the theater there is plenty of grist for the mental mill.

Though Unbreakable was still quite good, it doesn't really hold a candle to Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.  The ambiguity of the trailers leaves the story open for anything to happen, which of course, it does.  Not unlike The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan is masterful through every scene, with not only the story telling technique, but the unusual camera angles as well.  Though, parts of the film to tend to drag on a bit, the theme of Comic Books is prevalent, and adds to the fabulously foreshadowed ending.

But the director got such praise for what everyone thought was a great ending, I suppose he thinks these twists are the way to go.  More on that in a bit.So here comes *Unbreakable*.  I have to say, a lot of viewers thought this film was slow, but sometimes a great film requires patience.  I think that this had the potential to be the greatest film of the year.  Beautiful direction, compelling acting and a fantastic story.  Then the ""twist ending"" which the director worked very hard to keep a secret and which every review mentions.  I won't tell you what it is.  I didn't see it coming this time around.  But boy, it sucked.  Very disappointing.  That's what makes Unbreakable so heartbreaking.  What was easily a fantastic movie had all of its potential destroyed in a mere 2 minutes.  You would have thought SOMEONE could have told him and he could have changed it or even dropped the twist altogether.  it was largely unnecessary and wholly unfulfilling.I therefore can't tell you whether I recommend the film or not.  I gave it an 8 (which is, perhaps, too kind) because up to the ending it is spectacular, but like I said, the ending is what will sit with you after you watch it, and ultimately you'll walk away disappointed.",Unbreakable
873,sheriff_pony,The Sixth Sense 1.01,5,30 November 2000,"For those who haven't already watched Shyamalan's first masterpiece of last year, let's do it short: Unbreakable is not generally a bad movie. It has characters, a story and a concept, is carried by a considerable ensemble of stars and a director on his way to superstardom. The final two passages of the movie are pretty suspenseful, being supported by a (repeat, ignore this if you watched T6S) decent soundtrack. Now don't understand me telling you watching Unbreakable rather than The Sixth Sense. If you watched the latter one, you will maybe see that U is actually nothing but a rip-off( I don't really feel good about using this word, regarding the respect most people should have for Shyamalan. But any other director/screenwriter wouldn't get away with it, so neither does he.). The story has been changed for the occasion, but that'll be the end of the innovative part, because once you look closer to the plot, you'll find out that many aspects of it resemble T6S almost exactly. The one person that helps the other person develop/live with a supernatural power, the one catastrophe that influences the main character's life, the unhappy families, the hero's using his power to help people towards the end, and those were the obvious choices. And, even worse, U can't help resembling other movies. Even the plot-twist in the ending can't save much here, because it's too short, too little shocking or surprising, a little predictable and actually belongs to the ending of an average crime thriller. The direction is very patient, it is slowly flowing towards the climax, only the climax is not worth waiting for, the reasons are shown above. The shadowy quality of the picture, that was so hauntingly innovative and effective last year, is here simply a means to scare us, only this isn't a horror movie. Towards the ending and whenever the main character has a vision, there are overly noisy (aren't nearly all movies nowadays way too loud?) passages of drumbeats that try to convince us we have reason to sit in the theater and feel thrilled, dismissing that it's actually pointless. The only positive thing i can say here is that i have really tried to watch U pretending not to have seen most of it before. That's really the only thing for me to say to justify my rating Unbreakable 5/10",Unbreakable

If you thought 6th Sense was worthy of ""This Year's Best..."" read another review (though it would be strong this year).It is hard to write a review of this movie w/out giving too much away. Every little detail is crucial, and understated on so many levels.  David Dunne plays a security guard who survives a train wreck.  Samuel L. Jackson plays Elijah who tries to make him see how he survived the wreck.""Anti-action movie"" is really all you need to summarize the movie.  This means that movie is laboriously slow, like M.Night was paid overtime to shoot this movie, and anti-climatic.  Not to say that the climax was a let-down (the popular definition); but moreover, that the climax did not raise one out of their seat, yet still pounded them over the head, like a 2 ton weight, with realization, much like the 6th Sense did to most viewers. The details are subtle, though very crucial, only the discerning and the sophisticated will be able to appreciate it.  Nonetheless, _Unbreakable_ is very effective in its story-telling, creating a genre all its own.  I cannot think of any movie with which _Unbreakable_ can compare.The biggest problems with the movie is the pace, like I said, and the poor exploration of the climax (i.e the twist - I dislike using that word) in relation to Elijah.  It puts too much effort on the viewer to remember those details (especially w/the sleep-inducing pace).  _Unbreakable_ could still be effective as the anti-action movie, and anti-climatic, yet still give the viewer ""twist.""  My feeling is that the studio demanded a twist a la 6th Sense, to bring in the audience.When the movie starts to roll, pay attention to the statistic that it shows the audience.  Pay attention not so much to the numbers, but to the hobby it refers to.  When Elijah describes that hobby, and why it sells, remember what this movie is about, and how _it_ is reality, where hobby had become fiction describing reality.  Also, one more comment:  The irony b/t Elijah and David is amazing, classical text book definition.  Keep these comments in mind when you watch _Unbreakable_ they will make you appreciate the movie more, I hope.++ IMDB rating:  8 ++ genre rating:  10 (first of its kind); public rating: 6",Unbreakable

It is in fact perfectly plausible to see David as an ordinary man, and 'Mr. Glass' as a more-or-less common-or-garden obsessive nutter. What matters is how much one can transcend self-imposed limitations: a path that David is induced into through a remarkable (but entirely possible) series of life-experiences.

886,pettums,Really enjoyed this movie,10,26 November 2000,"Just to balance off the recent load of unfavourable comments, I went to see this film last Saturday and really enjoyed it.

887,dajb10,Really good movie.,10,9 December 2000,"Unbreakable had a hard act to follow on from the Sixth Sense for M.Night, but i believe he has succeeded in making a superior movie. The movie was far more developed than 6th sense was. While the movie runs at quite a leisurely pace it still holds the viewers attention for the duration of the film. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson were great in the leads from opposite sides of the spectrum and they received good support from Robin Wright Penn, and the kid from Gladiator was also good. Through the film M. Night uses great camera angles and shots for different scenes ie. Willis and the woman on the train. M.Night also does not treat the audience like idiots and actually tells the story as though his audience is not made up of bungling idiots who need everything explained in detail, this makes a refreshing change for the audience(well it did for me anyway). In fact i would go as far as to say it is one of the most original films i have ever seen. Before i finish special mention must be made of the score. It is one of the best of recent memory and comes into its own in the last half hour. In closing i heartily recommend Unbreakable to almost everybody as it has a great story and is very well made, although i got the feeling when i saw it a lot of the audience disagreed with my opinion. If or when the movie is viewed one should not expect another 6th Sense... expect a totally different movie going experience. Are you ready for the truth?",Unbreakable
888,tom.kat,Better than The Sixth Sense,9,24 January 2001,"An hour and a half into this movie I wondered how Shyamalan would wrap the film up in a nice little package, without room for a sequel. I shouldn't of bothered. The film was superb and the ending was a bigger twist than The Sixth Sense. Anybody who doesn't get Unbreakable should stick to Disney films. Bruce Willis proves once again that he can act. Most of the plaudits for Sixth Sense went to the kid and Twelve Monkeys to Pitt, although Jackson is superb as usual, Bruce Willis steals the movie with a subtleness most screen stars cannot portray. Unbreakable is a great way to start off what should be a fine year for movies.",Unbreakable

891,mikey.stuart,My views on this film,6,31 December 2000,"This film is very interesting.  Although not the fastest pacing plot, the mood, music and camerawork of this film are excellent.  It is a very gritty and dark film and you never know what direction the film will take.  Bruce Willis plays his part top class whereas Samuel L Jackson (in my opinion) gives quite a mediocre performance (well, below his usual standard). Another aspect of this film which I thoroughly enjoyed was the actual idea. He managed to make a film which crossed the normal conventions of films from this genre.  However, even though it sounds like I am praising this film I did only give it a 6.  Within the space of 2 minutes I went to loving the film (I would of giving it an 8) and wanting to buy it to thinking 'it was ok'.  It was the end which did this.  Obviously I won't tell you what it is but it is very disappointing, quite weak, as though he couldn't be bothered to think it through properly.  Saying this, the girls in my 'film group' seemed to think the ending made it better, whereas the guys thought otherwise.  He made it more realistic with the ending but it could have been done much better.",Unbreakable
892,manavd,Shyamalan is an original,10,1 December 2000,"No matter what you think about the film itself , some might like it and some might hate it, but there is no denying the fact that M. Night Shyamalan is an original. In an industry where  studio's spend millions of dollars buying rights for remakes, sequels, adaptations  etc etc there is a filmmaker that comes up with something new which in all fairness is not a very easy thing to do.That was one of the first things that struck me while I was watching UNBREAKABLE.Even though its plot is not as riveting as THE SIXTH SENSE , I think people would appreciate it better if they would just see it as another film and not as some kind of a sequel to SENSE.There has been a lot of discussion about the ending of the film being abrupt and not satisfying enough. Without spoiling it for anyone who has yet to see the film I would only say that the ending would work for you based on how you see the film.I think whats happening is people are going into this movie expecting to be blown away by the ending like in SENSE, and its these people who are going to be disappointed.Technically the film is sound, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra is instrumental in setting the mood for the film. The one camera shot technique used by Shyamalan there gives a very observer's perspective to the film. The score by James Newton Howard is subtle throughout and is noticeable only towards the end of the film.Performances by Willis and Jackson are quite good.Willis has certainly come a long way since his DIE HARD and HARDER days. However Spencer Treat and my fav Robin Wright Penn's characters are not well defined enough for them to have any impact.Overall I would not hesitate in recommending this film to anyone.",Unbreakable
893,cherry2x,M. Night Shyamalan does it again,10,23 November 2000,"What can you say about this true visionary on the art of film but he has done it once again.  Unbreakable is a heart felt and compelling work of the old adage of good versus evil.  Our hero and arch-enemy are both acted with grace, style and believability.  Not only do you see and hear the characters but you can also feel the emotion as it pours through in every word and action.The storyline of the movie is a bit weak and even somewhat slow at times. However, what this movie lacks in story, it more than makes up for in feeling.  The camerawork is exceptional, at times you are as much a part of the movie as you are a viewer.  For example, at the beginning of the movie when we see our hero on the train, we feel like we are in the seat in front of him eavesdropping on his conversation.  The sound and editing only enhance the feeling that you are part of the movie.The symbolism in the movie is much more prevalent than in The Sixth Sense. In my first viewing of the movie, I found myself only wanting to know what will happen next.  But the second time around, I was watching for the symbolism and I was not disappointed.  Mr. Shyamalan even makes a brief appearance in the movie himself.  It was nice to see him in front of the camera instead of behind it.I am on the edge of my seat awaiting his next film.  As with our hero's character in this movie, Mr. Shyamalan's film making abilities are truly ""Unbreakable"".",Unbreakable

Bruce Willis begins to believe that he is unbreakable, this after about 90 minutes of screen time.  And what does the subplot with Willis and his wife have to do with anything?  It does nothing but fill screen time. And why does everyone in the movie have to talk like they just woke up?? And the ending of the film is an entire let down.  Night has his signature ""surprise"" ending, but after that, the movie just ends with text explaining what became of these characters.",Unbreakable

It angers me that a lot of people said that it wasn't very good and that the last two minutes of the movie ruined it. They just don't understand the power of a comic book, and I think that the last couple minutes made the movie. I love Samuel Jackson and I think he was perfect to play Mr. Glass. Bruce Willis did an excellent job as well. It was nice to see Jackson and Willis do a movie together again. They work together well.

An older woman asked me if she had just missed something because of the age gap, I reassured her that she had seen it for what it was.... a bad movie.I'm suprised that two decent actors, Willis and Jackson, would do this movie. I wonder if they were just bored and decided to spend the weekend together with Mr. Shyamalan (the director) and his handy camcorder....yes it was that bad.From the beginning of the movie it was very clear how this movie was going to proceed, very predictable.The comic book inference was a joke, Mr. Glass.If it was not for a few decent comic book sketches then there would have been nothing worth looking at on screen.This movie should have gone straight to TV. Since it actually had a theatrical release it wont belong (days???) before its on the buy one get one free movie rack at Wal-Mart.I had to know how much it cost to make this movie, IMDB.com reports that it cost 75 million.

899,odin2001,A fascinating parallel of the super hero myth,9,17 December 2000,"Warning: SPOILER!  If you don't want to know some of the secrets ahead of time, don't read this review.  Unbreakable may not appeal to those who don't know comicbooks very well, but to those who have read and/or studied the medium, M. Night Shyamalan's new film is a fascinating look into comics and how it applies to real life.  Certain elements from comics are cleverly carried over, such as the hero's name (David Dunn) being an alliteration like Peter Parker or Matt Murdock or Clark Kent.  Secondly, David's nemesis is the polar opposite of him (brilliantly portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). And, like the Sixth Sense, there are things to watch for on the second viewing (for instance, David and Mr. Glass never touch at any point until the end; otherwise David would've seen everything that Mr. Glass had done). But it also showed that life is not like comics.  David was unable to save the husband or wife in the house where he rescues the children from the criminal he follows.  In that vein, the camera is almost never a static shot like a panel in a comicbook; it's always panning, just life is always moving.  And M. Night gives himself a nice cameo.  And on a technical note, considering how many glass and mirror shots are in the movie (for the sake of Mr. Glass), it's remarkable that the camera is never seen in the reflections (even Titanic gets the mirror caught in the reflective glass doors).  I suppose one's enjoyment of Unbreakable could be tied to your knowledge and/or enjoyment of comicbooks, but it's still a great look into what one person is capable of when they delve into themselves.",Unbreakable

It's quite unfair to compare this picture with the previous « The Sixth Sense ». Both confirm Shyamalan as a talented screenwriter and director. The plot of this film is far from being vulgar: a Security man (played by Bruce Willis who will never be a versatile actor) escapes unharmful from a train accident. After finding out he's the only survivor of the accident,he will be snatched away from reality by an Alter-Ego (played masterly by Samuel L. Jackson)who believes that Willis has what it takes to be a real-life hero. The final scene is breathtaking, but Shyalaman could have passed on the superflous subtitles that describe what happened after this final scene. Conclusion: it's a masterpiece of the Contemporany movies and Jackson is (after so many flops)as great as he was on «Pulp Fiction».",Unbreakable

The movie is extremely well done from nearly every angle.  The plot has a very comic-book feel, almost as if it were pulled from a first issue.  Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal as the fragile opposite of Bruce Willlis's ""Unbreakable"" character was perfectly executed.  These two actors were superb in their dynamic relationship throughout the movie, and as I think back to the scenes between them, I am reminded of the dialogues between Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling from The Silence of the Lambs.  This type of story had many subtle effects that show the pure writing and directing genius of M. Night Shyamalan.  Overall, a movie most certainly worth watching with undivided attention.",Unbreakable
904,hythlodayr-1,"Beautifully crafted, horribly underrated",9,12 July 2007,"Simply put, this is about two men who discover their true places late in life.In a serious nod to comic books and the superhero genre, the movie paces itself deliberately and explains perfectly why superheroes are necessary and how they may come about in a real-life setting.And as mentioned many times before the score, acting, and overall filming all beautifully make the suspension of disbelief possible.Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan's trademark twist-ending worked against him here as that is probably the only thing audiences were waiting for at the time. In fact the twist ending is almost besides the point, though it sets the stage for a much necessary sequel.Also unfortunate is that there doesn't seem to be any plans for an Unbreakable sequel; but with the recent popularity of NBC's Heroes, perhaps audiences will finally be ready for a more mature take on the superhero genre.",Unbreakable
905,hualuengpong,There was so much hype...,1,18 April 2001,"I can't believe how bad this movie turned out. I was hyped up so much after seeing The Sixth Sense that I quickly went to the theaters to watch this...This movie's ending was even worse too. Nothing near as good as The Sixth Sense. It's about a guy (Bruce Willis) that finds out he is a 'super hero' because he somehow JUST figured out he was invincible. Some crazy comic book fanatic (Samuel L. Jackson) thinks that since he is crippled with a disease that makes his bones fragile, there will be someone on the other side of the universe that is the exact opposite of him. So he thinks that if he is so crippled, someone out there must be invincible. That is when he discovers Bruce Willis' character. Plot sounds kinda stupid to me.Another thing I hated about this movie is the camera work. There is hardly any 'moving' around. Some scenes (when Samuel L. Jackson is talking about a picture and what it depicts very strangely) last forever staring at a part of a room that you actually want to see more of. All you get to see is a reflection on a toaster or some other stupid thing (ex: the reflection on the comic book picture) for about 10 minutes. Basically each scene was like this.My next complaint is that this movie didn't seem to have enough budget. When I watched the previews, I was hyped to see the starting scene with the train wreck. Instead, it simply flashes and he wakes up in a bed. BAH!!! How retarded. There are no other special effects whatsoever. I know all movies don't need special effects to make them any good, but this movie just sucked without them. What a waste of a movie that could've been so good. I won't ruin the plot, but they could've done a lot more to make the movie much cooler. Watch this movie if you want, but it's only worth a rental.",Unbreakable
906,MGLevandoski,A very clever film.,10,25 June 2001,"Unbreakable happens to be one of those movie where you have no idea how it is going to end.  It is superbly written and directed by Shyamalan, and is greatly complimented by the performances of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.Although there have been many comparisons between Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense, I find very little similarity between the two films.  The only thing that is the same, is that they are both written and directed Shyamalan, and they both star Bruce Willis.  The story lines are very different.I feel that it brought some substance to the very dead, and boring, super hero genre.  It did this by adding a touch of reality to an other wise very unrealistic story.  Shyamalan added the human touch, however cold it might be.  The screenplay was great, and not once was it Hollywoodized or made to be overly climatical.James Newton Howard composed a very fitting score, that complimented what was on the screen very well.  It is a great score and I was surprised that it was not nominated for an Academy award.All in all, Unbreakable is not, as so many have deemed it, a Sixth Sense rip-off.  It is film making of the first order and was one of the best of 2000, it is right up there with ""Traffic"" and ""Gladiator"".  I have seen it three times and each time it was more enjoyable than the last.  It is a brilliant film from a brilliant film maker, and I give it 10/10.

I lost count of how many times that I rewound the movie to re-watch a part that I thought was a key element that ended up being just ""fluff"" or a turning point in the movie.  Yes, I am a woman.  Yes, I love romance and comedy.  Yes I love action sequences that rate along the lines as ""do-able"" (if there is such a word).  But I have been pulled into the obsession with sex, drugs, rock and roll, and carnage for a movie to have some importance and depth.  Of course I can't tell you what the movie contains without spoiling it.  But what I can say is that this movie deserves the honors of NOT being compared to other movies, including Sixth Sense (which I did on my own to my husband when I asked him to get it for me).  See it as a black widow spider that has drawn you into her death/seductive lair and roll the dice to see what kind of a mood she is going through to decide and seal your fate.  And then you walk away with a deeper understanding of life, the people in the world, yourself, and what each one of us is put on this Earth to do, to accomplish, and what our demons will be for not following our destiny.  Who would be able to just shrug that off and say it was to complicated or a bomb and not think of it for months and maybe years to come.

Night Shyamalan from the Sixth Sense, and starring Bruce Willis, this is NOT the Sixth Sense at all.  This movie is MUCH slower moving, and while it does have a surprise ending, it is not nearly as surprising as the one from Sixth Sense. In this movie, Bruce plays a security guard at a football stadium, and he has minor esp.  He soon meets up with the fanatic Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a man with brittle bone disease, and lives a life in comic books because that's what he did as a child because he spent so much time at home.  He is under the impression that Bruce Willis' character is the opposite of him in every way, he thinks that bruce is as indestructible as he is weak.

912,rikb000,Another brilliant film by M. Knight Shyamalan,8,28 August 2001,"M. Knight Shyamalan is clearly a director who thinks a great deal about every aspect of his films. He has an uncanny ability to translate the emotional tone of his scripts into the visual medium. But it is Shyamalan's sensitivity to the psychological realities of his characters that breathes life into his technical mastery. In Unbreakable, Shyamalan uses this particular gift to turn a slow and largely uneventful plot into a deep and genuinely moving story. Like its predecessor, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable concerns the realm of the paranormal. David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, falls asleep on a train and wakes up in the hospital to find that he's the only survivor of a devastating train wreck. As the movie progresses, the reasons for David's survival gradually take shape as a miraculous possibility -- that he is literally indestructible. It is a credit to the director's maturity that he is able to develop this incredible plot virtually without special effects, overt gimmicry or emotional manipulation. The plot is moved along more by character development than the usual Hollywood flash; some may find the movie painfully slow for just this reason. Ironically, perhaps, it is this kind of patient forbearance that occasionally interferes with the full development of Unbreakable's characters. For much of the first half of the film, I expected David Dunn to show some recognition of the enormity of surviving the train crash. Shyamalan has commented that he was reluctant to show too much of Dunn's emotions too soon, but I think in this case he creates a situation where the audience might have difficulty identifying with the film's central character until late into the plot. Willis' rather wooden performance only intensifies our sense of alienation from the character. To a certain extent, I think this is a clever device of the director -- to contrast the liabilities of David's emotional invulnerability with the gift of his physical invulnerability -- but it comes off at times as too heavy handed. Another minor crack in Unbreakable's otherwise excellent facade is its rather abrupt ""twist"" ending. As in The Sixth Sense, the surprise is unexpected and emotionally jarring. I was quite impressed with how Sixth Sense presented its own ""twist"" ending without seeming contrived or manipulative; Unbreakable fares less well in that regard. After a slow and purposeful buildup and emotionally satisfying climax, Unbreakable's ending seems jagged and unnecessary. Over all, I think Unbreakable is an excellent film by a director whose talent is unquestionable. Despite some minor flaws, it's well worth seeing.",Unbreakable

First, the ""average man"" played by Bruce Willis, discovers he might NOT be average.In an early great scene with ""Mr. Glass"", played by Samuel L. Jackson, Willis must face his inner sadness. Willis, currently a security guard, is told by Mr. Glass that he is sad because he is not fulfilling his true life work... as a superhero and super protector of others.Great premise. A superhero discovered. But then it gets sort of murky...as the photography darkens (maybe it's me, but I want to be able to see...at least in some of the scenes).Too much mystery and not enough plot movement (for me anyway).I do think ""Mr. Glass"" is on to something when he says that comic book superheros are hints of lost legends...or maybe history.But the movie takes a while to get to the point. ""Mr. Glass"" has caused lots of mass tragedies in order to find the UNBREAKABLE person. Thus, he is both a mentor and a MONSTER.A good quality comic book could tell and show you this great story premise, but would snap up the pace.Irritating and frivolous vulgarities - In the comic store, some crude song lyrics are heard in the background with apparently no connection to the plot (And I had subtitles on my DVD when the 9 year old walked in)!!!

920,Marko-Kraljevic,Would have been much better without the ending twist,8,11 April 2011,"This is a fine paced movie, really involving as the time passes. The cast is excellent and Bruce Willis plays one of his slower rolls and deliveries a good performance. The main thing that bothers me is the so called 'twist' in the end. American movies and public have become obsessed with that sudden plot twists and stories inside stories. And the more of those, the better the movie is gonna pass with the audience, no matter one's quality. That's why those Saw movies for example are so popular, although they are pretty average.I think for this one the main story was sufficient to carry out the movie, as the script was already intriguing with enough twists. But overall it's probably one of the better 'superhero' movies around.",Unbreakable
921,roland_e_zwickk,Awesome movie!,10,8 November 2002,"I didn't appreciate the movie at first, but the more I thought about it, the more it intrigued me. I don't think that this is a movie for an average person; it takes some amount of intelligence to understand and enjoy.  In a second look, it is a phenomenal movie, like The Sixth Sense.  In many other good vs. evil movies, the bad guy is always totally bad, and the good guy is always totally good - there is ALWAYS a hand to hand struggle (in which the good guy wins).  But, this movie is awesome, it is DIFFERENT, the hero has flaws and the villain has a very endearing side.  In some ways, the villain is more righteous than the hero, because the hero would not exist if it weren't for the villain.  Thus, GOOD CANNOT EXIST WITHOUT EVIL...very good point.  I give this movie at least an 8/10.",Unbreakable
922,roland_e_zwickk,"Mr M. Night Shyamalan, You have done it again...",10,8 November 2002,"UNBREAKABLE (9/10)You gotta hand it to M. Night Shyamalan. The man practically came out of nowhere and suddenly he's written and directed two of the most memorable movies of the past two years. First THE SIXTH SENSE (8/10), which blew everyone away with its ending and its unbelievable box-office success, and now this movie, whose trailer is easily the best teaser for any movie that I've seen over the past year. It's mysterious, it's intriguing and it makes you want to see the movie. Excellent! And with that in mind, I will be writing this review knowing full well that nobody wants any of the film ruined for them, so I assure you that I will not be including any spoilers about the movie's plot in this critique. I just love a good mystery and sure wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone else.PLOT: Set in Philadelphia, this film stars two diametrically opposed men. One man is black and has a disease which makes his bones very easy to break. The other man is white and seems to be unbreakable. He is the only survivor of a train wreck and can't seem to figure out why. The first man helps the second man come to some kind of understanding about his situation.CRITIQUE: M. Night Shyamalan continues to impress. Here's yet another original creation of his that manages to successfully slap together a unique mystery, interesting characters, real life situations to which we could all relate and a touch of the paranormal. I love this guy! I hope he keeps it up because more movies like this is what we need. Of course, much like any other great film, this one is not for everybody. The film does have quite the slow pace, might come off as repetitive to some people and also manages to parallel THE SIXTH SENSE in various ways. But for me, I was hooked-lined-and-sinkered from its first two scenes, which much like the film's teaser trailer, just made me sit up and say, ""What's up with that? Intriguing...now tell me more."" The sequences in question basically set up the foundation of the two main characters in this film, and let me tell you, they grabbed me and that was that. I couldn't wait to find out why they were the way that they were, and what it all meant. But Shyamalan draws the film out slowly. He already seems to have developed a great eye for the camera, setting up angles just right, enough to give us a taste of the scene, but not the whole bite. There are also little hints dropped here and there, red herrings and a Hitchcockian score providing just enough background to allow for a gradual development of the richer points in the script. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan also seems to be finding himself a small part in his own films. Here, he shows up as a suspicious ""drug dealer"" at a sports stadium.But don't expect a horror with this film. That's not what it is. It's not a thriller either. No major ""thrill"" scenes in this movie. In fact, it isn't until the last twenty minutes that the film's leisurely pace is disturbed by some invigorating energy. I would consider this picture to be more like a good ol' fashioned mystery a la Twilight Zone. Set in an ordinary environment with believable characters, this film manages to creep us out with elements which just don't seem to make sense in our reality. Of course, much like any other good story, this film would not be a complete success unless we connected to the characters on the screen, and in this movie, I did. In fact, we could all relate to what Bruce's character is essentially going through. He doesn't understand his place in the world. He is confused. He is not sure why he is what he is. What is his destiny? We've all felt like him at some point or another in our lives and you learn to recognize that in his character early on.Bruce downplayed his character as much as he did the one in THE SIXTH SENSE (almost seemed like the same guy but in a different circumstance), while Sam Jackson was surprisingly restrained as the bizarre dude with the love of comic books. And as for the ending...don't worry I won't be giving anything away here, but suffice it to say that unlike THE SIXTH SENSE, a movie which I believed was taken to another level with that slap-in-your-face conclusion, this film's finish felt much more like a ""Hmmmmm, yeah okay, that makes sense"" kind of thing. Of course, some might scoff at the ending, but that all depends on whether or not you were ""into"" the film as it moved along. It certainly didn't make or break the movie for me, and I doubt it will blow anyone else away either. This film is not about the ending necessarily. It is about the journey, a journey that is deliberately unhurried, melancholic and intriguing. My guess is that anyone who was greatly interested in this film by its teaser, will more than likely be impressed with this film's brilliant manner of storytelling. It looks like Shyamalan is here to stay. Of course, once the movie is over, and this seems to be developing into a very cool Shyamalan tradition, you will undoubtedly feel the need to discuss the film with others. It's engaging, it's mysterious, perhaps even unbelievable to the more cynical in our society, but ultimately the film is an excellent demonstration of what a great director, a solid script, a deeper, meaningful message and well crafted characters can bring to a theatrical presentation as such. For me, the film worked on various levels and I hope that many others like it just as much. That's it and I hope I didn't spoil anything for you...that's half the fun!",Unbreakable
923,DarkOcean,Underrated movie,10,1 June 2003,"An underrated movie, a missing gem. This movie is IMO Shyamalan best work. A superhero movie, where the hero is born again.

925,spidEE,"Fascinating, Captivating and Underrated...",10,10 September 2003,"As I'm sure film lovers are probably used to hearing and saying now, Unbreakable is definitely the most underrated film so far this decade. Director M. Night Shyamalan has not forgotten what it takes to captivate an audience in a slow-paced drama. It is without a doubt that this is the best super-hero movie ever made. While all other super-hero movies deal with action, adventure, and martial arts, Unbreakable shows how a super-hero would really be if he were living in the real world. (I won't go any further into the plot than to say that this is the most realistic super-hero movie that makes you question the others.) As always, Samuel L. Jackson is great. Even in horrible movies, the scenes that he is in are worth it. Unbreakable, however, is a great movie where Sam Jackson is acting above and beyond potential. (does that make sense?) Bruce Willis plays an outstanding role as a man who discovers he might have ""special powers"". His extreme silence and pensiveness is comparable only to his role in ""The Sixth Sense"", and perhaps Billy Bob Thornton in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". It's amazing that one of his powers wasn't telepathy, because midway through the movie we feel like we can read his thoughts and emotions, without excessive dialog. Robin Wright-Penn is excellent as the wife who adds that perfect sense of ""Come back down to Earth, Bruce"" that we need to keep the movie realistic. Every scene in this movie is darkly silent and eerie. And, just like every other great slow-paced film, it gives you a treat every now and then. When that happens, the audience is taken completely off guard. This is the kind of movie where as the credits are rolling the audience is still sitting with their mouths open. If you watch this movie, you have to let yourself be absorbed into it. If you go in expecting X-Men, you will be disappointed. Expect a film that says that they can still make them like they used to, and you'll love this movie.",Unbreakable

The actors, Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson, were okay, but the story is horrible! I heard on the radio that it was bad, but I didn't listen. I went to see it with a good friend, and wish I hadn't! I stayed through the whole movie just to see if it ever got good... nope! I watched it again a few years later, hoping my memory was bad... once again, WRONG! I couldn't even watch the whole thing the second time. Sorry...M. Night Shamalan's other works are far better. The sixth sense, not bad, Signs, great...

928,d_douglas00,Can see why people love it.....but gaping plotholes spoil it for me!,5,28 July 2018,"As much as I liked some of the cinematography (defo a strong point of the film) and Jackson's character and the twist at the end......I couldn't help think to myself 'How the hell has this guy (Willis) got to his mid 40's and not realised he's never been sick and has superhuman strength?'. Ridiculous that Jackson's character comes along to point this out! Also, Willis' character is so unlikeable that he would never be lucky enough to have his wife and son around. The story is so unrealistic and full of gaps that it left a bad taste in my mouth.Top marks for the style of the film, I quite enjoyed the pace (or lack of) of it, but Shylaman has not given the story and context enough thought. For me, that really ruins it as I feel like he is treating the audience like fools. Very frustrating!",Unbreakable
929,CaliEmoBoy,Shyamalan's Masterpiece,10,11 July 2005,"In my summer Film Analysis course, we watched this movie. When I saw it in theaters, I had lukewarm feelings. Now, I see a whole different movie.The standard chase sequence in a movie like T2, or The Fast and the Furious, has close to one thousand shots. M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable has approximately four-hundred shots. Four-hundred! What is more interesting are the subtleties found in nearly each and every cut.Take, for instance, the beginning of each scene dealing primarily with Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah. Whenever Shyamalan makes a transition into one of Elijah's scenes, it's done by showing it through a some sort of glass--a reflection in a television monitor or a glass picture frame, a window, a car's rear-view mirror, a glass of water, etc. In one particular scene, Elijah is in a clinic, staring of into space as the doctor lists his injuries. Elijah says to himself, ""They called me 'Mr. Glass.'"" The camera then zooms into his eye, and cross-fades into an eye-shaped logo printed on, you guessed it, a glass window through which we see Audrey, Robin Wright Penn's character.Another interesting fact is that the color contrast has been altered. In various scenes concerning David Dunn (note the alliteration, commonly used for Stan Lee's superheroes' secret identities), there is a green hue. Also notice that David wears green colors, whereas Elijah wears purple colors. Likewise, many of Elijah's scenes have a purple hue. Not only are green and purple commonly used for classic comic book character (the Incredible Hulk, the Joker, etc.), but this is also a visual representation of Elijah's line about him and David being on the opposite ends of the spectrum.In addition, I strongly believe that this film was heavily inspired by Stanley Kubrick; not Hitchcock or Spielberg, as many assume. The long, ominous shots, the obsessive attention to detail, and the heavy use of the steadicam suggest Kubrick's influence. This could even be found in the music cues. When David Dunn follows the ""orange man"" into a house, at one point there is a one-second cut to the dead body of the home's owner, and the murderer forcing himself into the house--The Shining, anyone? Another often ignored quality of this movie is the romance between David and Audrey. It avoids almost all of the Hollywood clichés. You first think that this is a couple that should be, and likely will end up, divorced. However, the story reveals something deeper between them as it progresses. One of the most beautiful parts of the movie is when David is carrying her up the stairs after returning home from the house.In 2000, when the movie was released, the critical reaction was that the film was so-so, good or just okay--an alright movie, but nowhere near the quality of The Sixth Sense. Audience's views were identical. However, I truly believe that this movie will be fondly recognized years from now. Can anyone imagine that Stanley Kubrick was nominated for a Worst Director Razzie for The Shining? Hitchcock's Vertigo was considered weak when it was initially released; now it is considered perhaps Hitchcock's most personal film, and it ranks among his best work.I strongly believe that Unbreakable is Shyamalan's masterpiece. The problem with it is that the studio marketed it poorly. It is a drama that was marketed as a suspense thriller in the same style of The Sixth Sense, which is why most people were expecting something similar. The same problem occurred with The Village. Unbreakable might just be the most underrated blockbuster of the 21st century. If not, it's certainly one of them. Having seen it three times in the last week, outside of film class, I think this should have won Oscars for cinematography and screenplay, and it should have at least been nominated for Best Picture of 2000. And no, I don't think that's pushing it.",Unbreakable
930,tejaswi-nimmagadda,Great plot and dialogue.,6,2 February 2005,"This will completely spoil it if you haven't seen it.I thought this was a fantastic, almost profound movie. Obviously better than the Sixth Sense in a thematic sense but Sixth Sense was more water tight if you scrutinise scene by scene performances. The use of comic heroes and villains, about fate, about finding your own spot in life is gold!! In some ways, both characters are still children finding a meaning in life and a way for the future. The twist was a surprise for me. I commend those who saw it coming ""a mile away"" (maybe explainable by the fact that you missed the depth in the dialogues relating to comic books and fate). The clincher scene for me is when Samuel L Jackon's character is in a comic book store, reading a comic, and the store keeper is trying to close the shop, and Samuel L Jackson, having just talked about the fate of comic book characters, in trying to wheel himself out of the store accidentally bumps his broken leg into one of the aisles, demonstrating the very fate, he was just talking about.If I don't give this movie a perfect 10, it would be because: (a) the movie didn't milk the themes further; (b) the few scenes where Bruce Willis' character discovers with his son that he really is superhuman. I didn't quite understand or like how his abilities transform from being ""unbreakable"" to him being super strong (ie the gym scene). It makes it unrealistic, when everything else is realistic. One should be able to work out that they have superhuman strength but one won't be able to point to accidents in his life and say well that shows I am unbreakable or my fate is that I can never get injured.",Unbreakable

It's refreshing to go back and watch this movie and others like it.If this film doesn't receive a sequel, I will remain indifferent.

933,sophiavcorona,Feels like a first draft,3,7 October 2019,"My first question after watching this was, ""Who in their right mind greenlit this?""Why was this script not rewritten and rewritten and torn apart and then rewritten again?
The idea of the story is good, but the movie feels like a poorly-written first draft that never should have gotten this far.
There is so much left underdeveloped, too much left too developed, too much untouched, too much unexplored, and too much that was present that did not need to be. His relationship with his wife - why? It added absolutely nothing to the story. Even Glass's ideas are so surface-level, it's laughable. Had this been put through the shredder with a better writer taking the reins, this may have been a really good movie with some great underlying themes and metaphors.

It's all over the place and the majority of the cast are all terrible actors. Bruce Willis should never act again. I've never seen anything he did well in. Save yourself two hours and just watch Split again. That is the only good Shyamalan movie and it's not even that good. James Macavoy is the only reason to see it. He is a phenomenal actor.

This time I watched with a more open mind, and I've come to appreciate it somewhat.The usual standout Shyamalan traits: * Unique & interesting concepts, ideas and writing. * A handful of memorable scenes. * Generally excellent, understated performances from a great cast. * Meditative, hypnotic pacing which prompts you to look closer. * Some nice camera-work, with many scenes nailed beautifully in one masterful shot. * Yet another terrific James Newton Howard score. * You always believe that Shyamalan cares for his characters and stories. * His films always improve with multiple viewings.The usual annoying Shyamalan problems: * Mind-bogglingly stupid holes just ROB the stories of credibility... (How can a train derailment possibly kill everyone onboard!!?, Why wouldn't David think to prod himself with a sharp object if he's curious? Why would water-allergic aliens invade a planet that's water-based? How can a man be dead for a whole year and not notice? Did he never eat, go to the toilet, go to work, or notice that no one acknowledged his presence?) * Slow pacing gives you plenty of time to notice and consider these problems. * Some patchy dialogue. * Pacing can sometimes get TOO leaden for its own good. * His style of camera-work can occasionally feel self-conscious. * Murky, natural-looking interiors and cinematography lend a ""true-to-life"" atmosphere... but can also make for murky, average-looking video transfers.

It worked for The Sixth Sense, which I liked, it had a good sense of suspense and drama that kept the plot going.  It dismally fails for this movie... .....Finally the director looked at his watch and said, ""oh, time to wrap up this movie."" Willis finally puts his ""powers"" to use, which is NOT a very climactic schene at all.  Then there is some feel-good stuff, the obligatory surprising plot twist, which I am not quite mean enough to give away, and then the movie ends with a small paragraph serving as its so-called ""resolution.""  Samuel Jackson and Bruce Willis did an excellent job of acting, and I am told by a friend who is less interested in the movie as a story-telling device and more as an artistic medium that the directing was excellent.  In my opinion, this does not excuse the incredible lack of any suspenseful or engaging element in the plot. I recommend NOT seeing this movie until it comes out on video, preferably in the $0.50 rentals.  You won't miss anything, the film experience is not noticibly amplified by the theater atmosphere.

Also, too many aspects were like The Sixth Sense. Just like in that movie when something was significant, it was the color red. In Unbreakable, everything significant was a bright color, either red, yellow, or orange. And once again, M. Night made an appearance himself, I suppose thinking he is as clever as Hitchcock.

(You can almost feel the undefined sadness that's within BRUCE WILLIS' character). And like THE SIXTH SENSE the only person he seems to be in deep emotional contact is a boy. His son Joseph (SPENCER TREAT CLARK) loves and adores him despite the fact that even he get rejected (and kept on a distance) by his father wheras the boy's love and admiration seems boundless. His marriage isn't doing well either. Dunne and his wife (ROBIN WRIGHT PENN) live in separate bedrooms, they seem very sad througout the movie, sad but unfortunately still in love and neither capable to recognise or name their problems nor to handle them! A divorce seems inevitable.Like THE SIXTH SENSE the film has some kind of a `mentor' from outside the family. Meet Elijah Price (SAMUEL L JACKSON). This `mentor' seems to know more about Dunne than Dunne would have known or suspected about himself. After surviving a horrible train crash killing everybody on the train but David Dunne (who survived the crash unharmed) Elijah starts tutoring his unwilling and rejecting new `student' Dunne about the unavoidable truth: David is one kind of a very special species of men: their bones don't break, they don't suffer any illnesses, and their existence have a special purpose: they are meant to do good deeds, being heroic, fight injustice, or put into one sentence: David Dunne is destined to be a genuine super hero!Like THE SIXTH SENSE the lead character is unwilling to accept his new position and purpose in his life. He fights and rejects it deeply, and he needs help from others to open his mind and to accept the unavoidable.
Like THE SIXTH SENSE it is the path leading David on his inner quest that is important part about the movie (not the destination itself). His quest examines elementary issues like destiny and one's use in life, and the film avoids giving answers but leaves the viewer alone with his thoughts (even if you are not religious it makes you think and probably reconsider a few things).But the thing that makes UNBREAKABLE truly great is not necessarily the story itself but how the story is told by director M NIGHT SHYAMALAN. His style offers some virtues in directing which seemed to be long lost!! SHYAMALAN likes to use long angles without any editing at all allowing us to watch the characters becoming real-life persons - and we are allowed to look at them and watch them as they are working things out, questioning themselves, struggling with the situation they are in. It also makes you appreciating the work of the actors involved even more. You can almost feel these people and you really start caring about them. It gives you the feeling of some sort of documentary of real people and real emotions. Well this only could work because The acting is marvellous as well (as it is in every SHYAMALAN film)! BRUCE WILLIS has never been better, he is a genuine character actor trapped in the body of an action star! And SAMUEL L JACKSON is always brilliant. He was able to shine in every single role he had done previously, no matter how dull or stupid his part was - fortunately these times are over, this movie is the prove (Give this man a life sized oscar, why don't you!). ROBIN WRIGHT PENN is great as well. Although her part doesn't give her much to do really, her understated performance fit in so perfectly and works without any signs of vanity and mannerism that you have to adore her for her professionalism which makes her a truly great actress - especially if you think of the high rank of UNBREAKABLE from the very beginning! SPENCER TREAT CLARK did an equally good job playing David Dunne's son Joseph. His performance is as good as JOSEPH CROSS was in WIDE AWAKE or HALEY JOEL OSMENT in THE SIXTH SENSE and all the other kids playing in M NIGHT SHYAMALAN's films.I think one of the reasons that made THE SIXTH SENSE a huge hit was the editing of the movie: The editor of the film ANDREW MONDSHEIN did a great but more conventional job, making THE SIXTH SENSE faster in the terms of storytelling while UNBREAKABLE was edited by P. T. Anderson's editor DYLAN TICHENOR. His approach to films is lot more arthouse-like (but brilliant though). His low paced editing is much harder to find in the blockbuster movies of Hollywood. Since his style of editing is quite unfamiliar to the mass audiences which is certainly not used to concentrating on one angle alone for an entire scene I am not surprised that some movie goers consider this movie pretentious and even boring! I think that TICHENOR's editing fit in perfectly with SHYAMALAN's story telling (and is Oscar worthy), but Night should probably consider to reunite with ANDREW MONDHEIN who is clearly an editing genius in his own terms. His work gave THE SIXTH SENSE a little more `ooomph', and he as an editor is just as brilliant as SHYAMALAN is as a director and their styles match perfectly.Please, Night, do another one soon. I have started suffering from `Shyamalan Withdrawal' already!",Unbreakable

I was leary at first because the trailers turned me away from this movie.  I loved the superheros in everyday life idea, it reminds you of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, when the characters start flying more and more which makes you elevate your view of them to supernatural despite your idea of who the character is.  The DVD version includes a short ""behind the scenes"" featurette which points out a lot of the use of color and other aspects.  The only thing that ruined this movie experience for me was the superimposed text at the ending; ignoring this text(which wasn't in the prerelease screening) would have made the story twice as good.",Unbreakable

I thought I would never see a ""Bruce Willis"" movie that I thought was worth of a best movie nominee until ""The Sixth Sense."" Now, I've seen a movie with him that is worthy of the best movie award, ""Unbreakable."" Besides that M. Night's beautifully crafted ""Hitchcockian"" camera style grabs every inch of feeling and life in the world of Unbreakable, but only hints at the real story of the movie. Grotesque angles and dramatic lighting reminded me of Murnau and German expressionism that influenced the greats like Hitchcock and Orson Welles.

952,SmurK-4,"Sit up and examine a film for once, please.",10,12 December 2000,"There are two kinds of people who go to see films. People expecting an entertaining easy to understand story that will be told in kindergarten storytelling time narrative (i.e. Disney Movie). This, of course, is the most common viewer and the reason abstract experimental films are kept away from the other kind of viewer who resides in the same pool as person number one. Person number two is one who wants to be confused during and after the film. He/She wants to think about a film for weeks after seeing it (i.e. getting there monies worth). He/She wants to figure out what the storytellers where thinking and actually believes storytellers are Geniuses smarter than they are. Person number ONE obviously knows more than the genius (i.e. negative reviews of Unbreakable).Now, getting back on track, The Sixth Sense was balanced nicely between these two different personas, it took a few minutes to draw from it the main points. Though people understood it and thought it was entertaining (i.e. box office success). Unbreakable steps over that edge. It is not easily understandable because it uses an amazing new film convention which was set in motion by Joel Schumacher in Batman Forever.The comic book convention is highly refined and much more thought out in this film. How do you make films look like a comic book? Schumacher used costumes and sets, but Night uses a much more effective and unique style. Many scenes in the film drag out longer because Night is attempting to turn the film into a comic book. When you see the film look for comic book pictures (single frames will hold on the screen, these are comic book pictures). More importantly listen for short dialogue (i.e. short lines will fit in comic book clouds better).What does all this mean? Well keep an open mind dang you! Look at this film long and hard, see it twice and be amazed at Nights genius style of filmmaking. This film is not as easily understandable, but it's just a little over the edge of understanding. If you can just respect Night and watch this film closely you will finally notice that film, in it's most purest form is ART. This could be a first time for you if you fall under the person number one category. Read this review again after you see the film and you will finally figure out why you paid 8.50 to go see this 1 hour 45 minute film. Because when you read this review you will finally have examined your first film! My review is a perfect ten out of ten.

953,sparklehorse23,What a shame (Worst ending of all time?),2,27 November 2000,"Never before have I been so let down by a movie. I loved The Sixth Sense in spite of myself recognizing that, while not a particularly monumental work, it succeeded admirably in what it tried to do. It was fun, it was scary, it was surprising, if not particularly ambitious. Well, whatever sense was put into the crafting of that film was completely lacking in the making of Unbreakable. It is rather tragic really: great actors, great atmosphere, wonderful direction, more potential than you can shake a stick at...but with one flaw: it takes itself way too seriously. The opening scene sets a wonderful, haunting mood (the director, I believe, can safely be regarded as a master at setting a mood) but the rest is downhill from there. There are so many holes in the script I can hardly believe it got past editing and there are so many times throughout the movie where there is absolutely nothing happening or no point to what IS happening that the audience is left wondering if they missed something. But the sad part is, they didn't. The ending, while lauded as a clever twist, proves to be the single worst ending in the history of cinema. Throughout the movie, we are allowed to watch Bruce Willis bench press paint cans for 30 minutes, so why the quick, tacked on ending? Why the amateurish dialogue, the very predictable catch phrases, the horribly unsatisfying dangler? When the theatre lights turned on, I was hiding behind my coat, embarrassed for everyone involved in the making of this stinker. What a shame--great mood, great performances, great potential, all wasted in a meandering, pointless script hardly worthy of a high school production. Avoid at all costs.",Unbreakable

I found ""Unbreakable"" to be a very slowly-paced film that deeply rewarded me for being patient.  Yes, the camera work was masterful, especially the scene where Elijah falls down the steps.  And yes, the ending was a shock that put the precedings in a different perspective.  But, for me, the greatness of this film was its provocation of a discussion between my wife and I concerning the depiction of good and evil in the film.  On this day after viewing the film, I find that I'm haunted by the movie.

It's rather like watching the feature length episode of 70's kids shows (6 Million Dollar Man etc.) they felt the need to produce in order to help us poor brainless viewers. You knew you had to sit through it in order to get to the good stuff. I realise that M. Night Shyamalan isn't attempting to make The Matrix and indeed it isn't necessarily action sequences that the film is missing. It is substance of any kind. The characters are super-thin, the plot is spun out well beyond what it can bear and beyond a single 'Look out! Behind you!' moment towards the end of the film, the viewer's pulse rate is rarely troubled.M. Night Shyamalan presumably set out to lend the film the feel of a comic book.

Frankly, it is entertaining and stylish.  And if Virgin Suicides (vomit) is not butchered for its lack of plot and dependence on mood/emotion for development, then for cryin out loud Unbreakable deserves (please forgive me) a break!The plot is unbelievable you say?  Well, duh!  Men can't fly.  Women can't use lassos of truth to induce confessions.  Unbreakable is a synthesis of comic-book fantasy and dramatic film-making, it is not a testament to naturalistic empiricism.  Go read a physics textbook if that suits you, but don't whine that a movie doesn't explain the origin of a hero's powers! To the best of my recollection, neither did sixth sense.Unbreakable is a wonderful, mature rendition of a (yes) childish theme. Good guys?  Bad guys?  These are not things that fit into a post-modern world view.  But that is PRECISELY why they make marvelous material for a deep, moody, character-dependent film. It is silly to think of these things (heroism, justice), it is downright ridiculous.  And that is why Unbreakable succeeds in ways the sixth sense only hinted at, it taps into the real brutal nature of the modern world.  There is no one to save the day, stop the bad guy.  And, in reality, our private worlds (personal, professional, and physical) are as fragile and hopeless as Mr. Glass.",Unbreakable

959,yoga-girl,Not even home-town pride could save this film.,3,26 November 2000,"Unbreakable starts out slow, moody, and Sixth Sense-like but steadily grows more unbearable as it progresses.  First off, Shyamalan consistently shoots through glass doors or reflects his actors in mirrors (that is, objects that are NOT unbreakable).  Likewise, he seems intent on presenting each scene from an odd perspective (from straight above, slightly below sight-line, or rotating around and around).  Not only does all this fancy camerawork fail to bring any added depth, meaning, or artistry to the film, but it actually proves annoyingly distracting.  The plot trajectory, like the camera-work, also fails to support its meaning.  While fans of The Sixth Sense will come expecting the story to unfold slowly, the problem with Unbreakable is not one of pacing so much as structure.  Unbreakable is, fundamentally, a film with the content of a thriller but the structure of a romance.  In the hands of a more mature director, such as Neil Jordan, shifts in genre actually work to propel and complicate a film (for example, The End of the Affair). In this case, viewers will undoubtedly leave feeling cheated by a film that drops the ball on its own setup.",Unbreakable

In this pathetically slow drudge through boredom, we are also led to believe that heroes with boundless powers and superfluous villains actually exist merely because the people of this entrapped world have ""lost hope and must be given some"".Furthermore, sub plots pertaining to David Dunn's capricious behavior, marital issues and son's predictable manner only add to the already burgeoning story line in the form of unwanted and wasteful noise. The film's one and only high point - if considered high only because the film in its entirety is a low, is in its ending where those unfamiliar with sixth sense and easily entertained may find a trace of amusement.In a little more than one word (fit for a film a little longer than a hundred very long minutes), a brilliant tale of heroes and villains with less imagination than an autobiography written by Fabio and a little more action than you might expect from a Jane Austin film.",Unbreakable

That and the tone of both films are about the only things these two movies share.Unbreakable is a daring look into reality and a love letter to comics all at the same time.  The movie's concept that comic books could be rooted in reality could be treated as laughable by some.  Heck, my dad (sitting next to me) almost started laughing.

966,goldman-4,Weak directing; Terrible screenplay; mediocre acting,1,8 July 2001,"I was very disappointed with this film. On several levels.The screenplay (plot) was awful. I can't understand why so many people liked this story, why it has gotten so many 8-out-of-10 votes. I did really like M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense,"" and I guess I was expecting more of the same. The premise of this movie had potential -- I like the idea of a (super) hero existing, undiscovered, even to himself, among our midsts. But with a guy in his 40s? Am I to believe that this hero never figured it out his whole life, but then some crankpot comic book dealer enlightens him? It took the whole darn movie to reach this conclusion. This revelation should have been closer to the midpoint. That is, the hero scenes near the end should have been near the middle, and there should have been more acts of heroism, rather than dwelling on the past. And just how did the cripple (Jackson) with the glass-like body and bones manage to pull off all those terrorist acts? This stuff takes stealth and speed and some amount of physique. Pretty dubious if you ask me. Granted, my opinion, and others obviously disagree.The movement was painstakingly slow. I kept waiting for character development, but it barely happened. This seems the fault of both direction and writing. What was the director doing? Where was the director during the overacting of Samuel Jackson? Where was the director during the (what should have been tense) bland, unemotional scenes between Bruce Willis and Robin White as they were averting breakup? I just didn't believe their relationship.

That title is actually a buddhist term, which was used differently in the movie though.The director leads us to see a world beneath the world which is limited by civilization and knowledge. That alternate world is more like flesh than a appearance. It is like a lifeform and we are as a part of it doing our role in it. And it revokes a old belief about Fate.Imagination flowed to create a person who is destined to protect other people.

Some of the performances, especially Samuel L. Jackson's, are great.  However, Bruce Willis' attempt at a performance makes you long for his roles in the ""Die Hard"" movies or his role in ""The Sixth Sense"".  It's a truly stiff, wooden performance.  It reminds you just how much Willis is and should be an action film star only.  And what did comic books have to do with anything that was happening to Willis?  Is it to be implied that he is a modern-day Superman or something?  I don't believe I understood the connection there.  Call me stupid, but ""Unbreakable"" suffers big time.

Night Shyamalan presents the audience with a slow-paced, ludicrous plot which sadly denies the potential that the movie has lurking beneath its dull exterior.  Perhaps the first indication that the movie was as derailed as the ill-fated train came when David began to wonder if he had ever been sick -- oh, come on.  The performances by Robin Wright and Spencer Treat Clark were almost believable; Samuel L. Jackson limped his way through the film as though the story itself was enough to cripple; Bruce Willis's interpretation of the common man living a life of denial came across more like a sedated cretin who needed a miraculous and unbelievable incident (the train wreck) to give him the hint .......  When the ending came, it was about 60 minutes too late, as the inane plot had since ceased to wax entertaining.But, if Shyamalan had taken the picture along a different course -- then Unbreakable might have been worthwhile entertainment. My guess is that Unbreakable began as a wonderful idea but suffered from a misguided effort to bring the story into a very serious and rational vehicle.

The first act was the majority of the movie. By that I mean by the movie ends roughly 10 minutes after the plot gets interesting. It was like M.

The direction, the use of colors, symbolism, etc is simply amazing and ranks up with some of the all-time best directors in my book (see Kubrick, Lynch, Gilliam, Jackson). However, ultimately the ending of the movie is unfulfilling and disapointing. Not that it isn't a clever idea and an interesting twist on the premise and plot of the whole movie. No, it's simply anti-climatic and feels awkward, possibly because of the lack of a real encounter or anything truly moving. It's too bad, because by all other accounts this is a really good film.

The film moved at an even slower pace than Sixth Sense, something I didn't think possible.  I was really hoping for something amazing to happen.  Instead I left the cinema wanting my money back.  It just seemed as though M. Night Shyamalan didn't want any shot to be left out or cut.  A shame because the tension seemed to be going somewhere for the first 30 minutes. I gave Unbreakable 3 out of 10 not necessarily because it was a bad film. But more for the waste of the potential it lost as the movie went through. I think the director would do well to direct someone else's script and/or maybe give someone complete control of the editing.",Unbreakable
982,Snarkly,Totally Unbearable,1,13 January 2001,"I've never had the urge when watching a film to actually walk out, so I spose that makes this one unique.  Unfortunately I'd taken a friend with me so I didn't.After a while I just had to stay just to see how they were going to actually get to an ending with all the holes in it.I knew how bad it was going to be by the opening sequence.  The camera work was so bad (the sort known as ""experimental"" amongst arty critics, i.e. bad) I started getting a headache.  It almost seemed like two films.  Some of the scenes were well-shot, like the 6th sense, with a measured pace to add to some sense of feeling.  Some were ""how can we move the camera around to be pretentious and most irritate the audience"".  Unfortunately these outweighed the others by 2 to 1.Some scenes definitely were definitely too horrible for it's 12 rating (the stairs, the gun).There were a few moments of genuine feeling and warmth and humour.  But about 4 lines out of two hours does not make a good movie.It's a shame as the general premise could have been handled so much better. Bruce Willis' character just accepts what he is being told far too early in the film.  Some suspense (and believability) could have been brought in by him working towards even considering what he had been told as different events happen in his life. Instead as soon as the first question comes up he's asking his wife questions in the middle of the night.  A good editor could have reduced the worthwhile parts of this film to about 20mins.Bruce Willis is a good actor.  He probably did this in his sleep as there is no sense of life in his acting.Bad.

983,jhammertime2001,Hmmm.. I don't know,8,25 January 2001,"This movie kept me on the edge of my seat. It really was not what I expected, all you really knew from the trailer was that it was about a train wreck that Bruce's character survived, without a scratch, he was the sole survivor. The movie will surprise you in the first minute. I was a little blown away by the end, total surprise, and I've heard people say they saw that coming in the end. My friends if you saw that coming, you're obviously cursed by being too smart for the film makers. I didn't see it at all. I really left the theater, not knowing whether I really liked it, liked it, or hated it. I've decided that overall I liked it better than the ""Sixth Sense"", but the end did throw me, I think that if they make a sequel, it really helps the first movie, if they don't I think it somewhat hurts it. So I would just say that people will definately have different opinions on this one, I would urge you to go see it for yourself, but keep an open mind.",Unbreakable

Hmm...now that's forever.This is one of the most original films I have ever seen, and after the movie is over, you just walk away smiling and going, ""Cool.."" >From all the reviews I've read and heard, no one ever gives this movie a so-so rating. You either love it or hate it, there is no middle ground for this movie. I truly believe that is the sign of a great film, much like the first Star Wars was.Unbreakable breaks really new ground, it goes against the grain of what the audience expects. I was in the theater and I heard someone behind me second-guessing certain scenes, only to be proved wrong.Even how it is paced feels like it was going to be full of action, but it takes its time delving into all the characters and making you understand who and what they are.I like the fact that each main character has a proper, clear cut motivation. They either want to prove a point or decide to do certain things that might make the relationships in their lives better. The movie also has many layers to it, especially in the emotion department.Of course, the comic book references are superb! I have yet to see a movie that treats the comic book medium with such reverence, and to use comic books as a template to explain a big part of the story is something I don't think has been done in movies to this large a scale.Samuel L. Jackson's character Elijah Price has some of the coolest lines in cinema history. And the way he explains his comic book theories are ridiculous, but he pulls it off with a straight face, you either laugh because it's cool and you understand how cool ridiculous can get, or you just think it's all silly. Too cool.Of course, Bruce Willis, Spencer Treat Clark and Robin Wright Penn do a great job as well. I don't think I would have wanted to watch it as much if Bruce Willis wasn't there. Love his movies.I could go on and on, but then I'd be spoiling the film. But keep an eye out for M. Night Shyamalan. This guy's a crafty b****rd.Nothing short of genius.

Is ""The Old Man and the Sea"" like ""For Whom the Bell Tolls?""  I think not. Anyway... Only two things that bothered me about this movie: Jackson's hair and Willis whispering 75% of his lines.  Willis did that in ""The Sixth Sense"" and it drove me up the f****** wall. Not to give too much away, but the entire ""rescue"" section was grand, everything about it, really.  15 minutes of beautiful camera work, all of 4 words of dialogue, and the empowerment that we all dream of (and I love the ""costume.""  Reminds me of Hal Jordan as ""The Spectre""). I've met a lot of people that complain about the ending, but frankly that seemed to me to be the best part of it all; from the time Willis puts on that rain slicker to the rolling credits, the film finally starts moving, and all the pieces fall into place. Very slightly reminiscent of such comics as ""The Watchman"" (where was Alan Moore in the documentary?  Gibbons showed up, but not Moore, though there was Frank Miller, and I loves me some ""Sin City""), ""The Spirit,"" and ""Batman"" (normal men become superheroes). An interesting movie, and definitely one of the better movies to come out in recent years (not the best, frankly, but it doesn't suck), plagued only by M. Night's incredibly slow pacing.

Movie references to comic books & being comic should not go unheeded.Save your money, save an hour or so - Unless you have some vested interest in seeing a really bad movie, Unbreakable (2000) misses the mark - Producing or directing a movie this bad & then releasing it on an innocent public should be a severely punishable, criminal offense...",Unbreakable
989,laconian,Rich yet subtle,8,1 July 2001,"My kudos to M. Night Shyamalan for proving the consistency of his moviemaking abilities. ""Unbreakable"" is a movie that is rich in both technical brilliance as well as script quality.First, let me get my one objection for the movie off my chest. The ending could have been done better. The majority of the length of ""Unbreakable"" does an excellent job of building suspense, with the wonderfully muted, melancholy acting adding depth and tension to the plot. My problem is that it fails to live up to its own expectations; the ending does not consummate entirely what I expected it to. Somehow, in a movie that took painstaking details to illustrate every step and glance, concluding it in the manner that it did felt almost blasphemous. Maybe in a nameless action thriller it could be passed off as mere hackery. But here, it seems strangely out of place, kind of an enigma in itself...Now that the ugly part is over with, I feel almost obligated to sing the praises of ""Unbreakable"". Shyamalan's prowess with photographic techniques and processes shows through in this, with rich reds and blacks given to scenes of moist emotion and colder colors dedicated to the bleak, uncaring (uncared for?) world. One technique I particularly liked was the manipulation of photographic mediums, some parts using crisp 35mm films and others using angry, shuttered magnetic (or 16mm?) film. In the end, it all worked very well, because each technique seemed to integrate seamlessly with the plot and mood (notice the confusion and panic at the very end?) ""Traffic"" is a good example of processing overdose. ""Unbreakable"", on the other hand, hones it perfectly. The lushness of this movie comes in close second to the wonderful eye candy of ""American Beauty"". I could watch it again easily... with the sound turned off!On the more human side of the spectrum, the acting was wonderful. How nice it is to see Bruce Willis proving himself to be a true A-class actor! His unassuming and insecure behavior worked *perfectly* for this role. Samuel L. Jackson, like always, did a bang-up job with what the script gave him. Robin Wright and Spencer Clark's characters seemed a bit two dimensional, but they seemed to be minor roles compared to the prominence of Willis and Jackson's characters. A little character development would have been appreciated, but if the ending was a result of the time-constraint guillotine, then I would expect the developmental scenes to have gone too.The thing that people seem to complain most about this movie is the plot. I like the premise. A little fantasy in our movies isn't such a bad thing once in a while, is it?",Unbreakable

993,bunda_bindaas,A thinking man's movie!,10,23 July 2001,"Unbreakable (the movie) is an ingenious work of art. Art because it's slightly abstract in nature and leaves room for everyone to draw his/her own conclusion(s). Moreover, the plot, script and direction is indulgent to such an extent that it toys with the viewer's patience and imagination (some people are bound to feel that way, I didn't). It needs to be emphasized however, that it's not a complex, highly abstract phenomena we are talking about, but a story set on a very simple premise. It's important that anyone who hasn't seen the movie should NOT spoil his/her fun by reading any further. If you are looking for a quick rating, then in my book it gets a 10/10 because when the movie ended, I uttered `brilliant' inadvertently.
********************************************** The following section contains an in depth analysis and some spoilers. I highly recommend that only people who have seen the film read further.**********************************************Unbreakable is a mature film, for the 12 year old residing with in, every mature adult. Sounds paradoxical? Well, it sort of IS paradoxical because the treatment of the film, the lighting effects, the screenplay (there are hardly any humorous scenes) and the acting will not appeal to 12 year olds, but anyone who loved reading comic books as a kid, will lap up the content and the message of the film, instantly. I remember reading books on Superman and Max Luthor. Kryptonite, the planet Krypton, Clark Kent, Louis Lane, bring back memories of a world that really existed in my imagination. That's not all. I remember reading Fauladi Singh comics, about a local sci-fi savior of the planet, residing on the other side of the Pacific.What a fantasy world that is. What's common about super-heroes is that they add wings to a child's imagination. Their effect is so deep rooted that we start seeing the world through their eyes, until age and 'reality' take over. The question is, what happens when a child does NOT come to terms with reality and still resides, in his make-believe world, as he grows up? Or is 'reality' different from what we perceive it to be? There is a dialogue in the film where Samuel L Jackson suggests that comic books are symbolic epitomes of life and man has always used figures to illustrate superhuman feats. Comic books are in fact extensions of our own history, our heritage. They represent facts of life, albeit in an exaggerated fashion. That in essence, forms the basic premise of the film. Unbreakable unabashedly, IS a film about super-heroes. It's a film that vaguely questions the reason behind our existence. The film thrives on the perennial and epic battle between good and evil. It's also a suspenseful drama and although, it doesn't end with a knock out punch like `The Sixth Sense', the final scene is supposed (and meant) to shock the viewer. As one can see, there's no specific genre to which the film belongs. In many ways however, it becomes discernable that we are watching the work of the man behind `The Sixth Sense'. The story again is set in Philadelphia. Bruce Willis shares a rather `uneasy' relationship with his kid. The whole film has been shot with blue filters, giving the film a `spooky' look and furthermore, there is a surprise `twist' in the end. But the similarity ends there. I think (and I might be surprising a lot of people here) that Unbreakable is a superior product coming from Shyamalan. Yes, I mean to say that Unbreakable is better than `The Sixth Sense', which I think is overrated! Why I think the film is brilliant? Simple, it breaks trends and stereotypes. It puts forth a new theory and makes the viewer think. Super-heroes are not infallible. They are not always busy fighting crime and as the film suggests, there might be super-heroes, who are not even aware that they have been gifted with superhuman powers! And yes, taking into account, nature's balancing act, if there's a super-hero then there should be a super-villain too. The arch-nemesis, the symbol of evil, whose very existence, is dependent on his battle with the super-hero. Only in this case, the hero (David Dunn played by Bruce Willis) is a confused and depressed individual. His marriage is on the rocks and he wakes up sad every morning. The first indication that he is a super-hero comes, when he escapes from a train derailment, where all other passengers excluding him, are killed. Only he comes out, without a scratch on his body. He never falls sick, something that even he failed to notice. On the other end of the spectrum, there is Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson) who is born with a congenital defect that makes his body too brittle. He has suffered 54 fractures during the course of his life and has spent most of his time inside the hospital, reading comic books. Elijah and David are connected together by a metaphysical force, stresses Elijah and he is the one who asks David if he has ever fallen sick in his life. WARNING: ****** Major SPOILER ahead******Now I move on to the part, which I think makes this movie a standout. The questions and the theories the film espouses. Super-heroes need not be any different from a common man, except for the fact that they might have some highly developed instincts. Premonition for example is such an instinct. Telepathy is another and in this case, the hero is gifted with a `contact-flashback' along with a body, which is....UNBREAKABLE! That's theory #1. This also answers the question as to why our hero wakes up sad every morning. It's because he's not doing what he is supposed to do. Protect people, save the world, that's his real job (Theory #2). The question now is, what power is his nemesis gifted with, apart from a very shrewd brain? The film unfortunately doesn't tell. If we now look at the large picture, for every hideous monster in this world, whose crimes make us wince with disgust, there could be an anonymous savior, whose heroic acts go largely unnoticed. That's theory #3! More like conclusion #1 that I drew from the movie.Another question is, just imagine what would have happened if Elijah hadn't been lucky, in finding out `the opposite end of the spectrum' after just 3 attempts. That's the most horrifying conjecture of all. Unbreakable, therefore is a masterpiece in my book. It's highly intelligent in it's tone and everything (lighting, screenplay, the slow pace and the acting, which is highly subtle) in the film, only serves to accentuate the effect, it has on your mind. There are very few films that can serve as compelling examples of cinema that is high on content and intellect. Unbreakable undoubtedly, fits the bill for people who are fascinated by films that make you think. I know, I still haven't stopped thinking!",Unbreakable
994,jedi_phil,Good story? Bad Ending?,2,12 August 2001,"I listened to the build up, entered the theater with great hopes sat down and started to get involved in a decent story line. The on screen connection between Willis and Jackson is excellent you can tell the men have worked together before. The story builds up slowly but strongly until half an hour before the end of the film and then it falls to pieces. It seems as if the writer got block and couldn't figure out where to go and decided to write the dismal climax, the worst ending to a potentially excellent movie. Its a shame that such a potentially good film was destroyed again. Is it just that producers and film writers are getting sloppy?",Unbreakable
995,reyashines,"Not suitable for anyone, ever",1,28 August 2001,"This film was truly bad. It went nowhere in the slowest way possible. Please note that I was not looking for an action/adventure film. I had seen this movie advertised as psychological and suspenseful. The only suspense I had was in wondering when it was going to get to the point, or at least just end. I did not find the lighting to be ""spectacular;"" it was dark. The music played over the dialogue in several places. Bruce Willis was absolutely pedestrian in his performance, as was Robin Wright Penn, who appeared to be stoned throughout the film. Samuel L. Jackson was like a caricature of an over-the-top actor.There was no great story, as a story requires a beginning, a middle, and an end, and this story kind of just stopped without really defining the middle and definitely not constructing an end. There was no great acting. There was no great anything, except a great waste of my time.As for the son contemplating shooting the dad, it was so out of left field that it seemed like someone threw it in later to at least give the movie something for people to talk about.",Unbreakable

M. Night Shyamalan is a great writer, director, storyteller, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson show some great acting - Willis shows again that he's not only able to play action-heros, but also reserved people, like David Dunn in Unbreakable. And what to say 'bout Sam Jackson - Pulp Fiction, Shaft, Jackie Brown, Star Wars - it just seems that this guy can play everything, from cool ex-Cop to wise Jedi-Knight - fantastic. The movie itself is some kind of calm and quiet, but not boring - don't get me wrong, not even one second in my opinion it is boring, it's very interesting to see David realize what he really is.David Dunn is the only survivor in a fatal train crash, and step by step he has to find out that he's some sort of ""different"". He was never ever sick, never hurt, not even after the train crash, not one single scratch on his skin - and from that point on he realizes he's not like other human beings.

997,ChcPenguin,Never bought it,4,22 October 2001,"SPOILERSI saw this movie twice, about 10 months apart. The filmmaking is what you'd expect - similar to Sixth Sense. There is, of course, a 'secret' that is revealed towards the end. The first time I saw it I was completely engrossed until the 'secret' was revealed. I simply could not buy into the premise that comic books are modern cave paintings, meant to pass down legends of real people doing real things. Movies are all about suspension of disbelief. However, this movie presents itself as a 'reality' movie, there is nothing to indicate that the world is not the one we actually live in. Then near the end we are supposed to buy that Bruce Willis is a super-hero and Sam Jackson a super villain. It just struck me as lame. There was no overriding message or theme or whatever. In the Sixth Sense there was a definite message about death and redemption. Furthermore, it was possible to buy 'I see dead people' because it was revealed early (in the previews even). So the suspension of disbelief was easy. In Unbreakable I spent the whole movie thinking about what grand message was forthcoming - were Willis and Jackson two sides of the human condition frail and strong, or exploring the feelings associated with being the only survivor of a tragedy, or something, anything. I was looking for something that never appeared, perhaps I expected too much after Sixth Sense. In the end, it was just a movie about comic book heroes in the modern world, but you don't know that until you've invested in it, and it never delivers. The second time I watched it, knowing the comic scenario I found it completely boring, slow, and not clever. The DVD has no extra stuff worth watching, but M. Night presents the stuff with a smugness that gets irritating after such a let-down of a movie.",Unbreakable
998,daverebadus,An almost great movie that needed more work on the ending.,7,1 October 2001,"This movie was almost great.  It was very good, but when compared to Shyamalan's other big hit, ""The Sixth Sense"", I get the impression it could have been better.  Just like in the other movie, there is a good twist that's hard to predict.  But at the same time, it felt abruptly finished.  This movie could have been as great as ""The Sixth Sense"" if more time would have been spent writing the ending.  Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend this movie.  That is my only real negative criticism.  It was nice to see Willis in a movie that isn't filled with guns and explosions.  I hope he continues to take roles like this one and ""Sense"", movies that require serious acting.  With these two movies, he's off to a good start at becoming a serious actor",Unbreakable
999,aasaxell,Utter waste of time...,4,22 September 2003,"I'm usually very selective when I watch movies and have a knack for avoiding things that I ""know"" I won't like. Unfortunately, there are two drawbacks with my ""intuition"". Firstly, I obviously miss out on the odd great film due to the classic book-by-it's-cover prejudice. Secondly, when my sixth sense fails me (pun painfully intended) and I watch a movie that I should have steered far clear of it's, well... to put it politely, basically very annoying.
After being reluctantly convinced by my girlfriend to spend two hours in front of the TV watching ""Unbreakable"" with her, it's safe to say that I'm very annoyed (I had a feeling I wouldn't like it, but the things we do for love, eh?). Oddly enough, the only other movie I can honestly say I have felt this annoyed with, after the end credits have rolled by, is ""Signs"". Go figure...The acting in ""Unbreakable"" was fine under the circumstances, Willis and Jackson seldom let you down in any film. The music was fine (although misused in places, I thought, but hardly anything worth losing sleep over). The camerawork and editing was fine, even inspired on occasions, the scene with the curtains blowing in front of the camera comes especially to mind. But if the story doesn't work, the movie doesn't work (unless we're talking about porn...and we're not)The film presented a fairly interesting premise and went downhill from there. It starts out with nothing really happening followed by nothing in particular. After some uneventful flashbacks, some empty dialog and a melodramatic kid with a gun, the story builds up to a fairly uninteresting rescue scene. I'm not asking for a 15-minute action sequence or over-the-top heroics here, it just felt unmotivated and tame (don't even get me started on that whole water-kryptonite analogy). Odd, since this scene was supposed to be Willis' character's defining moment of clarity and realization of ""what he truly was"" (already forgotten his name...I finished watching the movie 1 hour ago, that says something, doesn't it?)After the ""climax"" I patiently awaited the trademark twist. Now, I've seen and enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"" (not my favorite film but a 7/10 at any rate) and I truly thought that the plot-twist was intelligent and well-written. Going on that experience, I placed what little faith I had in the hands of Mr. Shyamalan, hoping that he could at least come up with something to salvage the time and effort of hundreds of hard-working craftsmen who wasted their time making this movie, and the time and effort I spent watching this.
Needless to say, I thought that the final unveiling of the ""shocking truth"" pretty much summed it up; Tame, uninteresting and quite silly to be honest. Don't get me wrong, I love silly. I gladly rank ""Wayne's World"" and ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" alongside, say, ""Midnight Cowboy"" or ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" on my personal list of favorites. But they at least were trying to be silly whereas ""Unbreakable"" was just a failure.Face it, he lucked out with ""The Sixth Sense"". He's a one hit wonder. Many people (for some reason) compare Shyamalan to Hitchcock which I think says something about Shyamalan's fans (the ones who enjoyed ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"" at any rate).Shyamalan makes smart, challenging films for stupid people.In a few words: Don't bother... 4/10",Unbreakable

It adds continuity to the film and gives it more of a comic book feel without dumbing it down to the level of a comic book. Aside from the use of color, the lack of color in some scenes contributes most to the mood of the main character. The greys portray the security guard's feelings. the shots of just willis's face and the dreary colors make this film stunning. I only saw it in the theatre, on the big screen.

1005,Dendros,Unbelievable,2,10 November 2013,"Pretentious and boring, with a corny and sometimes unbearably stupid dialog. Sorry, but the whole story is just not believable; you do not have to create your own disasters to try to pin- point your opposite being, you just have to monitor the news, and even that should be more than one person can manage. Referring to the logic in the film, since there are more then one person with the same disorder as Mr Glass, there have to be more ""unbreakables"", so they should not be that hard to locate. But maybe David Dunn was just lucky. How many disasters do you have to survive to classify as unbreakable? A lot of scenes in this film is angled at making Mr Dunn stand out as exceptional, but it just too laughable. Somewhat unorthodox camera work gives this film an extra star, but this is just a waste of time. Just wondered how they manage to recruit both Bruce Willis and Samuel J. Jackson, but of course, Die Hard III...",Unbreakable
1006,vinnybball14,Terrible Attempt at Emotion and Drama in this Disappointing Movie,1,1 September 2008,"I'll say it right now, Unbreakable is my pick for worst movie ever made. Not necessarily in terms of quality, I'm sure some Sci-Fi channel movie would snatch that prize, but in terms of writing, acting, and most importantly, directing. I counted how many words Bruce Willis said throughout the entire movie, my final total was 6 (that is not technically true as I didn't really count, but I'm confident my estimate is within about 10 of the actual number). There is an unbelievable amount of epic staring at each other done by all of the characters involved. I really wanted to enjoy this movie when we popped it in, in fact it was my choice to rent it, but by the end everyone in my family was laughing quite hysterically (needless to say the movie was not supposed to be funny). I do not enjoy when a movie is filled with dumb characters, in fact I really hate it when it seems every character is mentally deficient. This is one of those movies. One scene in particular struck me as incredibly ridiculous. Bruce's son decides he's going to shoot Bruce to show everyone that Bruce is truly invulnerable. Bruce and his wife freak out (naturally) and try to get the son to put the gun away. In a moment of unintentional comedy, myself and two other members of my family all said out-loud, ""For God's sake, just shoot him."" The movie would have been over and this horrible scene would cease to poison our minds with contagious stupidity. The big twist at the end was not clever, and relatively easy to predict, meaning of course that it was disappointing and therefore fit great with the rest of the movie. If you are someone who can REALLY get involved in a movie and truly feel the character's pain. then perhaps you will love this movie, but my entire family just couldn't get over how ridiculous everything was and how everyone kept staring at each other in an unbelievably corny way. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are looking for a comedy, cause after all, I found this movie quite hilarious in a pathetic sort of way.",Unbreakable

I definitely suggest the comic book fans to see that movie. But with moderate expectations, not high. I watched with minimum expectations. And I liked it. M. Night Shyamalan shows his vision. The scenes are perfectly directed. Soundtracks perfectly fit in the movie. Some of people may not prefer to go deep during a specific scene, but we see these scenes a lot in this production. The theme songs are along with these scenes. But the ending is a little disappointed. ""Two well-known actors"" choice of M. Night Shyamalan is replacing this disappointing with ""it's OK"". Both Willis and Jackson show their nice performances.",Unbreakable
1009,bullet-catcher,Shyamalan's streak remains unbroken.,9,6 March 2004,"I've noticed that M. Night Shyamalan's movies tend to have a very mournful quality about them, and consistently are peopled with characters who've had a measure of life snatched away from them. His antagonists, and even the secondary characters, all seem to have something missing from their lives that aches at them. I had the pleasure of watching THE SIXTH SENSE for the first time only hours before seeing the director's follow-up UNBREAKABLE when it was first released theatrically. So for me the connection is very immediate and noticeable.Shyamalan is at his craftiest when he inverts a genre movie, which so far has been his hallmark. THE SIXTH SENSE was a ghost story, and SIGNS was an aliens-take-over-the-world story. By that line of comparison, UNBREAKABLE is a ""super-hero"" movie...but I think a viewer who gets caught up in such a summary is missing the heart of the film. Comic-books (a medium with a devoted but minimal following) are only the framework within which these characters get to explore very tangible issues.UNBREAKABLE unfolds at an admittedly liesurely pace, but I for one enjoyed that. It's not a traditional ""comic-book"" movie, and in my opinion has no need to pace itself like one. Shyamalan has a true storyteller's gift for staging and timing, and is able to make something as mundane as a character descending subway steps seem chilling and perilous. It's that slow burn-storytelling that makes such scenes pay off.It should also be noted that Shyamalan is great at drawing-out strong performances from children, and Spencer Treat Clark continues that trend in this film. Also, Samuel L. Jackson displays astonishing fragility in his role of Elijah (especially when contrasted with his title character in another film from the same year, SHAFT 2000).And the soundtrack by James Newton Howard pulses in much the same way as the actual movie does, building to its most notable crescendo during the train station sequence. It's understated and moody, but it resonates with something powerful beneath the surface, exactly like the story itself.Far more than a ""comic-book"" movie, and yet very much that. Real life doesn't fit neatly into square panels, and neither does this film...Shyamalan's streak remains unbroken.",Unbreakable

The idea of an ordinary man, at least seemingly so, turning out to have super human powers is always intriguing. This movie takes a look at the idea of what a super hero would be like in real life. The only problem with this movie was the ending. The ""surprise"" ending is predictable, and the very end, leaves the viewer unsattisfied. I feel like Shayamalan could have improved the ending by showing David taking on other ""arch enemies."" Even a short sequence showing him taking down other criminals would have been more satisfying. As it is I was left wondering what happened to David. Did he continue in his role as a ""protector of the people"" or did he decide to hang up his cape as the scene in his home implies.",Unbreakable

He is married and in a train, coming home. A woman sits next to him and he takes is ring off. This is human. He's having troubles in his marriage and sees a beatiful woman. Humans like company and like to socialize. Soon, the train crashes and everybody dies except David.

I hope it wasn't the superhero based theme of the film that made it so unappealing, don't worry, if thats a turnoff its not your average superhero film. Full of surprises, amazing performances, and another wonderful score from John Newton Howard, this film will leave you fulfilled and amazed.It's a shame though, it does leave you wanting more and there was plans for sequels, but because of the failure at the box office, this doesn't seem likely.

For his fans I get it, you think the twist is great but for me not a chance period. Please let me make it clear, I do require a bit of substance to a movie and I will hold it to a special standard predicated upon what that movie actually is. The problem with M Knight is that he relies too much on the plot twist and misses out on the actual plot. I could go on and on about this scene and the lack of point of the movie itself. Much like his other fails, signs lady in the water and the happening, this movie is just trying to hard. Its end result is essentially calling the title "" Unwatchable"" because that is what it is. Not since I watched Napoleon Dynamite have I fallen asleep multiple times to get through a terrible movie. I won't ruin this movie with spoilers but seriously, If you want a movie with little to no brains to watch skip this movie because it isn't intelligent enough for it to even qualify as a stupid movie. I would recommend such terrible movies like Flash Gordon or even Killer Klowns from Outer space before this movie. Jesus I would even go as far as to say that a movie like Tucker and Dale has more to the table as far as creativity or twists than anything from the M Knight Lame Ducklong has offered since he brought us dead people.

I would rate this movie 7 and a half out of 10 as the message which the director was trying to get across to the viewers was not extremely clear but i do think it was to not let a guy mess with your head as everyone has their own secret gift inside them and so you should find it yourself not let anyone try to find it for you.

Comparing the two movies, Unbreakable is complete rubbish! You're better off watching the American TV series ""Heroes"" to be honest. I was very disappointed with the movie - it is highly overrated. This movie had no story-line at all and deserves a 1/10. I expected more from a film starring Bruce Willis. You are better off watching Superman or Spiderman movies.

1024,ChaoticReviews,A Masterpiece,10,28 July 2014,"This is a movie you can watch again and again. It is no wonder it has a cult following. If you are a comic book fan, even a little, this is a must see. Bruce Willis plays a superb persona, the classic role of the ""reluctant hero"". The pull of the normal and mundane demands against the lure of his newly perceived calling. Samuel L. Jackson gives a disturbingly good performance, leaving my jaw dropped the first time I seen it, and I still get tense during certain moments, yet one can not help feel pity for his character. Two thumbs way up for M. Night Shyamalan, he proved once again he is a master of drama and suspense thrillers. Eduardo Serra shows his time was well spent at Louis Lumière College with his amazingly conducted cinematography. Solidifying the sadness of both lead roles, vivid yet dark scenes full of contrast and detail, reminiscent of the 1940's/70's Batman and The Spectre; vigilante in a dark world. The way he captured the comic book art on film, he deserved a reward in my opinion. Finally, the music by James Newton Howard, need I say more? The man is a genius and excels with every composition, in quality and speed, a rare talent indeed. There is an overall feeling of melancholy, even in its brighter moments. The comic book references are numerous and to a fan of the sub-culture, it created even more depth to the story. This movie still leaves me pondering over the words Elijah (Mr. Glass) said ""If there is someone like me in the world... and I'm at one end of the spectrum... couldn't there be someone else... the opposite of me at the other end?"" -roughly 30:18 into the film.",Unbreakable

Night Shyamalan can produce such quality and then fifteen years later, produce something as bad as The Visit.The cinematography is amazing and it actually adds emotion or heightens the experience in some scenes. Some conversations are filmed in one take, and from great angles, which isn't that abnormal, but it's so good to see a film with hardly any behind-the-head angles that swap every time the other person speaks.The only reason I'm not giving this a 10/10 is because there was one scene where I couldn't quite understand a few words said by an elderly lady and towards the end, there's a scene where I was wondering why a character hadn't done what most people would've done. I'm trying not to spoil anything, but my 9/10 is an indicator that these slight flaws obviously didn't spoil the overall quality enough to bother me.I'm happy to give this a 9/10.

The major actors in this movie are Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright, and Spencer Treat Clark. The story is about finding hidden American Superhero who can't be harmed. There is hero, but no one knows that who is the hero, and even hero himself. I really enjoyed this movie, because the ending was different than what expected. The overall story of this movie makes senses at the end, so it could be boring in the beginning. To be honest, I didn't enjoy this movie in the beginning but as I was watching it, I fell into it. I personally think this movie is little bit different with other famous hero movies such as Superman, Batman, Spiderman, etc. The director of this movie, M. Night Shyamalan always come out in this movie, so it's one of the special thing in his movie. I have watched three movies that's directed by M. Night Shyamalan and all of them were thriller movie. As he always does, he used long shots when he was filming. These long shots helped me to concentrate easily while watching. I would recommend this movie to everyone, because everyone can enjoy this movie. This movie doesn't deal with religious event or other things, so everyone would like this movie.

It was again filmed around Pennsylvania like most of his work did such as, The Village and Signs. Some of the major actor or stars would include Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson which they played a total opposite role in the movie. It began with a scene that shows a baby was born but the baby is not like others baby, this baby is born with something ""special"". If you didn't watch this movie tills the end, you will never understand what's the point of the beginning. After a little backgrounds, of the movie, it begins with the story of a guy named David Dunn (Bruce Willis) riding a train back home which then something tragic happened. Guys pay attention to the present of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson)'s walking stick, when Elijah falls in one scene the walking stick too drop and shatter like a glass which glasses played a major role in the movie signifies something. Overall, I would say Unbreakable was a pretty decent movie if you love the ideas of super heroes and comic book. But if you love a movie that have lots of stuff happen in it and teaches people a lesson or a moral, this is a great movie. I would rate it as an 8 out of 10 because overall Unbreakable did pretty well, the actors played their rolls pretty accurately which shows us their personalities.

I always caught it in the middle or near the end on TV, so I decided to go OnDemand and check it out.First, I am a M.Night fan. I like his storytelling (Lady in the Water) and twists in his movies (Sixth Sense, The Visit). I knew what to expect from this movie...sort of.From the previews you know that Bruce Willis' character (Dunn) survives a train wreck and for some strange reason begins to show 'unnatural' abilities. Samuel L. Jackson's character (Price) is mysterious, almost obsessed with Dunn, looking for answers. The film explains some of those questions, yet leaves a lot to the imagination.Throughout the film, you see the relationship grow between Dunn and Price, leading to the possible Hero-Sidekick equation.

Unfortunately the hour long slow beginning was only followed by another 45 minutes of annoying cuts, boom sound effects, and Jackson falling down the stairs screaming in pain.In retrospect, that was the best part of the movie.  Of course at the time, you are expecting that there might actually be a part better.You would be wrong.If you liked the 6th Sense, rent it again.  Or, stab yourself in the eye with a pencil.  Both would be more enjoyable than sitting through this REALLY boring movie.My tagline - Oh My God!! Somebody throw a pie!

1035,arsanova,Intriguing Premise But Utlimately A Hollow Shell,7,5 February 2005,"The premise behind 'Unbreakable' is intriguing and competently executed. But ultimately the film feels like watching a one trick pony over and over again. As original as others seem to find this film, it is just another exploration of the mythic hero's journey. And the journey is dull.The acting is as strong as we would come to expect from Willis, Jackson, and Wright. The plot has an interesting premise that attempts to bring the supernatural into a context of concrete reality. And there are a few nicely conceived plot twists including the ending (no real surprise in the end though). But the movie takes so long to get where it's going that it ultimately felt hollow. Ever bite into a chocolate Easter bunny only to find that it's merely a shell? If you are a relatively sophisticated movie consumer M. Shyamalan provides you with the entire content of the movie in the first 30 minutes and then takes nearly another hour-and-a-half revealing a conclusion we already understand. 'Unbreakable' is suffocatingly tedious. We understand Bruce Willis' character is special and Shyamalan uses some effective plot devices to highlight the point such as inferring that Willis has never been ill. Great, but it felt like Shyamlan took another 20 minutes to support it.I read a review that stated, 'Every scene in this movie is darkly silent and eerie.' The movie has the seem feel as 'The Sixth Sense.' Yet I don't feel that the technique was used to good effect here. It attempts to add weight to Willis' growing acceptance the he maybe an extraordinary human but does nothing to further the plot development. All it really does is slow the film down, attempting to milk emotion from the viewer. Every bit of dialog hangs like the breath of a dying man.Watching 'Unbreakable' is akin to slowly peeling back the layers of an onion until you reach the core. Unfortunately it's a tedious process, every layer is the same (as well as the core,) and you can't help but crying even without a lack of emotion. If you enjoyed 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs' you may enjoy this movie as well. But I'm increasingly finding M. Shyamalan's efforts nothing more than polished emptiness.",Unbreakable
1036,eelliott,A bit disappointing,7,26 November 2000,I found Unbreakable to be a bit disappointing.  It seemed Willis' character never makes his own decisions.  The whole movie he does whatever he's told; whether his wife wants him to quit football or his newfound friend wants him to be a ... well that would be spoiling it wouldn't it. Also this seems to be one of those movies that ends where it should begin. It's kind of like watching the pregame show without sticking around for the superbowl.  My advice: Catch it on video.,Unbreakable
1037,tmbgdork,"Suspense thriller my cheek, this movie bores a hole in your skull.",4,28 November 2000,"Ok, I won't go into the similarities to the sixth sense, because we all see them and know they're there. I will say, however, that a movie concept as cool as Unbreakable that comes out as badly as this is a darn shame. Bruce Willis speaks about 4 lines (yes throughout the whole movie), and the pauses from his character aren't the least bit dramatic - they're annoying. Ok, his wife and he aren't getting along, she's breaking down, and he stands there and says nothing. Twice. I know it's supposed to show how unhappy he is, but how realistic was that. Don't even tell me this was anti-realism either, because buddy, it's not. The first, say, hour and a half was spent trying to figure out if Willis was ""Unbreakable"" or not, which made for one of the slowest moving plots I've seen perhaps ever. I did love Samuel L Jackson's character, it's a shame he was ruined by the horrid plot. And the ending, with the postscript that tells you Jackson's character's future - WHAT WAS THAT? It was a pretty good ending, up until that. Sheesh. If you felt like seeing this movie, do yourself a favor and just go see sixth sense again. 2 out of 10 stars.",Unbreakable
1038,Echo_Beach,What a disappointment!,5,22 August 2001,"I rented this film on DVD last night, I should have saved my pennies!It was maybe naive of me to expect another Sixth Sense but my hopes were high. The film started out alright, the first 15 minutes were actually exciting and full of promise but then it completely disintegrated.  I had to force myself to sit through the whole thing hoping it would suddenly turn around and surprise me but alas.At times I got the feeling that great chunks of the story had been cut away leaving only a series of (low?) highlights.  I found the whole thing rather corny and flat.Reading through other comments on this film I can't help wondering if I skipped a few chapters on the DVD....  Maybe this film was better on the big screen.  I must admit that the cinematography was beautiful but to call this ""one of the best films this past decade"" seems to me a bit over the top!Maybe the fact that there are no extra's on the DVD should be a hint.",Unbreakable

Those in the theater with me were laughing at the idiotic weight lifting scene, and shaking their heads in disgust at the movie once the lights came back up.My personal pet peeve, though, was the laughable idea that Samuel L Jackson, a man who will turn 52 in just a few days, could portray a character born in 1961 (Elijah Price) is.

That film shocked and delighted.  This one fell short if it was trying to live up to it's previous cousin.  But there was much to enjoy.   While echoing the Sixth Sense feel and pace it featured a much fresher, if somewhat cheesy, premise.  I was drawn right in and entertained throughout. M. Night has a way with words, actors and camera that lead an audience gently into the film, making them care about the characters.  You find you're hanging on every word and movement.  99% of this film was excellent - the 1% hesitation is just feeling that this class act of film-making mixed with a fairly cheesy, basic story idea was slightly at odds.

1045,calvelage8,A pleasant work of fiction.,9,5 December 2000,"In my humble opinion ""Unbreakable"" is an even greater achievement than ""The Sixth Sense"".  While some can argue the similarities in tone and mood, I feel that this film goes even deeper, into the question we all ask ourselves; ""Why are we here?""I've heard many people comment on films based on comic books set in realistic surroundings and this may be the first film I've seen that approached this idea in the reverse.  What seems like madness at first slowly evolves into a sense of purpose.  People who questioned the ""Whats"" and ""Whys"" come to realizations through greatly differing means.If I'm being elusive in my descriptions, it is just because I don't want to spoil the marvelous twist at the end for those who haven't seen the film yet.  Surprises like that should best be enjoyed by staying that way, as surprises.All in all, I feel that while some may find ""Unbreakable"" unbelievable, I have to ask why some are frightened by ideas and images which question their reality.  Which is exactly what the characters in this film are made to do. Be it as mundane as day to day family life, or the remarkable idea that you just may be something special.My gratitude goes out to Mr. Shyamalan for going against the norm.  May more like him come to the fore.PS.  Just wondering if anyone else put together the connection between the end revelation and Samuel L. Jackson's wardrobe.  Pretty sly of Mr. Shyamalan, no?",Unbreakable
1046,alexharakis,"A beautiful, modern day fable.",10,23 January 2001,"I reckon this is the sort of film you'll either love or hate. I think it's more of a guy film - most of the women I've spoken to really didn't like it. This is because the film is told mainly from the male perspective - little things such as when the married Bruce Willis character removes his wedding ring before coming on to a sexy young woman; then when he fails to woo her, he calmly covers his tracks by pretending that he was just being 'friendly' all along - I suspect a female audience will find little sympathy with such a character, whilst a male audience will be more forgiving (especially bearing in mind the state of his lonely, sexless marriage).
Admittedly, the film is at times very slow. Personally, I found this a refreshing quality in a mainstream film - it gave you a chance to really savor the characters and the atmosphere, but I can understand why some people found it a drag.Otherwise I thought the film was excellent - an intriguing plot with supernatural undertones (implied rather than explicitly presented, and therefore all the more effective). The director follows the structure of his previous film, ""The Sixth Sense"", allowing the story to gradually unfold. The final twenty minutes - moving from the hero's sequence of self-discovery of his true nature right through to the final bitter twist are absolutely magnificent. In fact, although it shares the same haunting, bittersweetness of ""The Sixth Sense"", I found this film more mature and thought-provoking; it's also a lot less compromising, which is probably why it was a bit of a disappointment at the box-office.In addition, the director treats both his stars with a large degree of respect. This is Willis's coolest role, and possibly his best performance; he deserves an Oscar nomination, though he almost certainly won't get one... ""Unbreakable"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Armageddon"", ""Pulp Fiction"", the ""Die Hard"" trilogy - he must be the most iconic moviestar since Steve McQueen, able to combine drama, comedy, action. Samuel Jackson is also in fine form - gone are the over-the-top self-parodying histrionics of his recent performances. Instead he provides a wonderful foil to Willis's laconic hero - flamboyant, eloquent, sinister, and amazingly charismatic.Overall, a first-rate drama - for once Hollywood has decided to ignore the kiddies and make a movie aimed at intelligent adults!",Unbreakable

1048,cyberdoc84,Another Great Multi-Layered Film by M. Night Shyamalan *SLIGHT SPOILER*,8,17 November 2000,"I was lucky enough to be invited to the Philadelphia premiere of Unbreakable last night.  What I got to see was another well crafted, multi-layered film by one of the most prominent filmmakers of our time that will keep you talking for days.On the surface, it was a film about a man who possibly may be ""Unbreakable,"" a thought provoking exploration of the trials of a man looking to see what is special within him and how he fits into the life that he has made for himself.  On the other hand, the film could be the equivalent of a first edition comic book (comic books figure prominently throughout the movie), relating the battle of good and evil to the ordinary people among us... or is Mr. Shyamalan really saying that these people (superheros and arch-enemies) really exist among us, only not dressed in neon spandex leather tights, but in the ordinary clothes of an otherwise unremarkable person?Though the story line was probably not as strong as ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was a tremendously compelling film with some of the most amazing film and sound editing that I have yet seen in a film.  From a cinema buff's standpoint, look for long, continuous shots with camera movements that keep you deep in the perspective of the omniscient observer, as well as judicious use of the altered realities from the perspective of the hero.  Add to that, the excellent sound effects and sound editing (just -listen- to the sounds of a fall by one of the characters), and you've got a great film that holds you to your seat to the ending credit.By the way, Night was gracious enough to speak with me briefly at the post-party, and he said that there was even more symbolism in this film than there was in ""The Sixth Sense.""  After hearing that and thinking about it for a bit, I definitely think that one viewing of this movie will not be enough for me, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again to look for all the details I missed the first time around.",Unbreakable

1052,mdavria,Read only if you want to know what it's about,8,26 November 2000,"Finally a movie that the preview and commercials do not give away the whole thing. In fact, this movie didn't give anything away in the trailer. I loved it, but I can see why some people will hate it. First off, when someone goes into a super hero movie such as Batman or X-Men they know that they are walking into a comic book movie. But with Unbreakable, people are tricked into seeing a comic book movie which I personally think is awesome, but most people will just feel like a comic book nerd. I don't read comics, but I am interested in heroes. This was the greatest development of a superhero without the use of a flashback. Samuel L. Jackson is the perfect super villain, but what makes him so perfect is that he is real. He has a real reason to hate, not only because he was born the way he is and was called Mr. Glass his entire life, but because he is so obsessed with comics that he wants his own life to become one. He truly is crazy. Shymalyan did an amazing job with this film and he truly surprised me, not so much with the ending, but with the entire thing. Maybe this movie will only get respected by a larger audience when there is a sequel made because society doesn't care about background stories, they just want to see people with super human powers save the world such as in X-Men. All are great movies, but Unbreakable is by far my favourite ""super-hero"" movie to date.",Unbreakable
1053,halo_on,Absorbing,10,25 November 2000,"Director M. Night Shyamalan has a way with depth and emotion in his latest movie, ""Unbreakable"". After watching the extended footage and interviews with Shyamalan from ""The Sixth Sense"" DVD, I was quite confident that I would be able to spoil any surprise ending he could throw my way. It is clear that Shyamalan is incredibly gifted in the art of misdirection. I honestly had no clue how the movie would end, and it was very rewarding in a way that ""The Sixth Sense"" was not.""Unbreakable"" isn't a tearjerker.. This isn't a movie aimed at your heart nearly as much as it's aimed at your mind. ""The Sixth Sense"" was, in my opinion, much more of a warm and fuzzy movie than ""Unbreakable"" is. A lot has been said about how Shyamalan movies end. Without giving anything away, I'll just say that this one is much more open to conversation than ""The Sixth Sense"" was. After we left the theater, it was very rewarding to talk about the ""clues and hints"" that were placed in the movie along the way.. and of COURSE we were left with the feeling that in no way has Shyamalan cheated the viewers, or created something that isn't coherent.Bruce Willis has come a LONG way in his acting abilities. I never would have guessed that his career would have taken this path. I sort of mentally typecast him in ""Die Hard"" and ""Armageddon"" type movies for the rest of his life. Its clear that he is a capable actor with a broad range of facial reactions and emotion. Half of the fun of ""Unbreakable"" is watching Bruce Willis react to his enviroment as we slowly begin to understand whats going on.I can only hope that M. Night Shyamaln's career is just starting, and that many more movies are to come like this one. They just keep getting better and better. I'm still frustrated at myself for not figuring out the ending however ;) I guess that is the way Shyamalan likes it. Fine by me.",Unbreakable
1054,lilybudd,Previews definitely can lie,1,23 November 2000,"After seeing the preview for Unbreakable you expect a much better movie than what you actually see. The movie basically was about the deeper meaning of comic books, and any living person can tell that a comic book has no real deeper meaning. A man with a bone disease spends all his hospital times reading comic books, he figures that since his life is so meaningless that he should try to be a comic book villain, wearing only purple, and trying to fine the superhero to match his role as supervillain.

But this story and its execution is sluggish and obvious.  While we're given a final twist, like the first movie, it's more of a 'who cares' than a 'WOW!'. And even though 'seeing dead people' is EXTREMELY unlikely, somehow this twist seems even less likely.  There were a few times when I outright laughed at the lack of finesse: when David Dunn fell in the water, and when he hung up his 'cape' after his heroics.  Come on!  Every shot for the past 15 minutes had his cape or his cape's shadow in it.  Then for added drama we get the big 'cape' shot!I admire Willis' talent and Jackon's too.  It's too bad they can't tell how a movie will turn out just by reading the script.  Mr. Shyamalan might get me back in the theatre, but I'll be reading other reviews FIRST the next time.

1058,emmansi,"Good, but not good enough",7,23 November 2000,"I've always tried to convince myself that it is bad to go see a movie waiting for a masterpiece. I've done it a thousand times and I'm almost always leaving the theatre disappointed. I remember when i went to see ""The sixth sense"" I didn't know what to expect. A new young director who had also written the script wasn't telling me much... After watching the movie I knew M.Shyamalan would be one of my favourite directors. So when I show the previews of his new movie I was expecting a new ""sixth sense"".Unfortunately that wasn't what i found yesterday when i actually saw the movie. Don't get me wrong; the movie is quite good and surely better than a bunch of other c*** we are watching this time of year. Is it though good enough for Shyamalan? In my opinion NO.The problem with this movie is mainly focused at the story. You immediately understand the main point and you are waiting for something interesting, something different, something special to happen...but it never does!! The concept is great and that proves what a movie genius Shyamalan is but... This movie gave me the feeling of something waiting to happen but it never did. I left the theatre wondering ""is that all?"". You know, the same feeling of something good left incomplete...No-one can say that it is a bad movie. It is perfectly directed (i remember the same scenes with the camera moving up and down following the actors, the same way as in the previous movie), i think both the main actors did their best in the limits of their roles ( i loved the way Willis was moving and talking, plu
s the fact that in the whole movie he never smiled a bit...)and as expected the photography and the soundtrack were the most appropriate. Most of the scenes were taken in the dark or in mostly ""grey"" environment and the movie in total was perfectly balanced around the characters.But... But it was extremely slow (even for Shyamalan...) and the main problem in my opinion is that it didn't promote the story. This story could open a thousand new doors for someone like Shyamalan but for a strange reason he decided not to follow any of them. After the first half an hour you are wondering why you are watching the same staff over and over again...why doesn't he move forward? Trust me this was the most disappointing part for me...I really cannot explain why a so talented director didn't spot that at any point... I can't believe that watching the movie himself he didn't feel he left the job unfinished... It is a shame because this could be another excellent movie. Instead it is just another ""good"" movie, among the hundreds other that come out each year!!

I didn't know what to expect as a sequel from Shyamalan. However, I didn't expect him to actually prove a great answer to our call for something different. Also sad is that Shyamalan's fortitude has been confused with mimicry instead of stylistic aptitude. He calls the best performances out of his actors and his story.

Of course it has the episodic twists and the morose undertones that we have felt since Praying with Anger (there is always a modicum of immateriality in all of M.

Jackson plays an entropic hero that is so well cast, he could rival De Niro on any given subject.  And of course there is Willis, who plays the part of the eudemonistic spirit who we have loved since Blind Date.

The ""safe route"", however, causes more damage to his life.  The story finds him deeply depressed, withdrawn, and in danger of losing the two most important people in his life as a result.  His wife complains that he is not the man she fell in love with; and he even shrinks from his son's natural admiration, ashamed because he knows he is unworthy.Having reached the bottom of the barrel and shaken by a brush with death, he is forced to re-examine his life, find and finally embrace his unique gift. As with the rest of us, he realizes that he had several opportunities in the past to follow his unique destiny, but was too afraid or lazy to actualize his potential.We truly live in a ""time without heroes"", as observed by Elijah.

I also thought there were too many scenes that repeated what was just stated, and too many scenes where not much is happining.  To tell you the truth, I am one of the biggest Bruce Willis fans, and was terribly let down.  I rated it a 6, just because of the ""surprise ending"", which wasn't too surprising, I mean it wasn't a big enough surprise to have everything lead up to that.

With probably the most ridiculous premise for a film since Disney gave us that elephant who could fly, the storyline was laughable, Willis' stony expression bordering on that of a man with severe constipation, and just how are we supposed to take Jackson seriously when the man is clearly sporting an excited paintbrush on his head?Shyamalan appears to have mistaken coma-inducing sluggishness for atmosphere here as we plod laboriously through the film hoping, waiting, for something - anything - to happen.  The subplot involving Dunn's failing marriage and his clearly lunatic child adds nothing here, simply acting as filler.  A low point in the film, indeed, when I found myself praying fervently that Dunn's son, wielding a gun with the intention of shooting Daddy to prove that he is superhuman, goes through with the shooting, kills him, then his mother and finally himself.In short, anodyne, dull, unexciting and any more synonyms for the word 'boring' that you care to fill in.  Don't even bother to get it on video, wait until it's on TV one night when your friends have abandoned you, your partner's left you, your pets have died and you've got no money left for booze - face it, things can't get worse then and you may just enjoy this film.",Unbreakable

Most people with Osteogenesis Imperfecta do not grow to normal height, not to mention above-normal.Rarely, people with Type I (his type in the movie)do reach normal height, but I don't know, this still bothered me. Also, He mentions that there are four types of OI. This is true, but he also says that ""Type Fours don't last too long"". He is referring to the type where babies are born with a barrel-shaped ribcage that constricts their breathing until they either suffocate or break all their ribs. The only thing is, this is type 2, not type 4. Just thought it would be interesting to note. Great movie, by the way. In my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's best.

Good music, memorable lines (especially the closing paragraph), great writing and casting...The filming, that make shots appear as if they were out of a comic book, the appreciation for art, the contrast between opposing characters (visual and character, etc.), just like in comics and visual arts.

I couldn't say that the most memorable time was the first one I saw it because every time I see it I like it more. I've had 12 times of this magic and meticulous experience now. I can assure who's looking for advice that nobody has yet had my feelings for it. I observe and examine every scene that reveals itself like a piece of puzzle that finaly fits perfectly well. The directing here is absolutely splendid. I give extra merit to Mr. Night for writing it himself. It's what most directors don't do. Here's the reason why he's so close to his characters. They're original and not only that, the performances are brilliant. They're real and pronounce their words in almost a whisper. Its pace is entertaining and slow at times for the better, when dramatic moments burst up. The film has some of the most memorable moments and quotes in history of modern cinema. You've just got to contemplate the colours used in the production design in a very self cared way. It's so nice to recognize the Sixth Sense cellar in the weightlifting scene! They've painted it another way of course, but I guess I was one of the few people to find out. You can tell because of the little room as seen downstairs. It's these details which make me appreciate it more. Most of the set was made in the old Philadelphia Civic Center, like in it's predecesor. Pale yellow and dark green is present in most of the track. The cinematography by Eduardo Serra is superb. The lighting and camera angles are unique and help to fill up your mind with the mind blowing James Newton Howard soundtrack. You call the editing a winner when you come to terms with it to build up the criticism. One of the things you never pay attention to but apreciate here is the marvellous sound. Great ending! I read the script before seing this and fell in love again after seing the better final result on screen. I really don't understand why people want to compare it with The Sixth Sense. What's the point? They've got nothing to do with them because it's not a sequel case. I'm extremely disappointed because of the non oscar nominations.

It does deal with comic books, but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies. The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comic-book world, at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comic-book movie, others a brilliant comic-book movie. And yet, there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comic-book movie. It's more of a drama, just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie. Both are excellent dramas, but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement, and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comic-book.

Many reviewers comment on Shyamalan's skill as a director, but where these reviewers see immense artistry and skill, all I see is pretension which generates a false sense of suspense. Rarely in this movie, or any other Shyamalan movie, does the suspense derive from the plot. Instead, he relies on shot techniques to bring out emotion in the audience.

Those were the great parts of the movie.My big negative on this movie were the characters. The stated reasons that the character were acting the way they did, and the relationships between them all seemd like B.S. There was also a depressing lack of humor or action in between the interesting parts.

This film has a fairly simple storyline, although you have to have an open mind to accept it. I saw it twice in the theatre and experienced it again with my wife in the comforts of our home (with the kiddos asleep).  It's a good lights-out, cozy-up and pay attention film.  It's not a fast film.  There are no steep peaks or deep valleys to yank your emotional string.  Nor are there any sex or drugs scenes used solely to draw certain patrons to the movie theatre.  There is some violence however, but it has its place in the story and it is not graphic.  This isn't a movie to get excited about, but I did found it enjoyable enough to watch it several times (eventhough I knew how it ended).",Unbreakable

In other reviews I have read, the tiresome comparison to super-hero comic books overshadows a great bit of social symbolism that is way beyond what we can get from a comic book.This movie illustrates similarities at opposite ends of the bell curve, the mutual exclusiveness of good and evil, and the imperfect hero.A piece of character development people seem to be missing in this movie is that David Dunn (Willis) was really a victim of a selfish wife (Robin Wright) who stole all of his potential from him.  Her character reminds me of her portrayal of ""Jenny"" in Forrest Gump.  She did a very fine a job at getting me not to like her character in both cases.  In Unbreakable, she is as much of a villain as the ""real"" one.I think that the ending, contrary to other opinions here, was absolutely perfect.  We are going to see two more of these movies, so the ending of this one is not really an ending at all, but a way to tell us who the good guys and bad guys really are.I am wondering who the cerebral villain will be in the 2nd movie.Rating: 10",Unbreakable

The point is, why do we all love superheroes? Because we beg to believe there is more to humanity than the scientifically and medically prescribed. Unbreakable is a superhero's superhero movie, it dares to suggest there may be more to our mundane existence than the immediately provable.

1129,gonzalezprocio,Severely underrated and totally worth watching,8,6 September 2021,"Before watching this movie for the first time, I had heard, as many other reviewers on this platform, that this piece was Shyamalan's most boring (worst) film. While I do see where people are coming from, especially since most viewers enjoy fast-paced, action-packed movies (which Unbreakable is certainly not), I completely disagree. The movie is subtle, and it requires viewers to see beyond the ""superhero"" storyline to understand the director's intentions. Once you do understand it, however, you cannot help but to keep coming back to it.The thrill you get from watching the protagonist, David Dunn, slowly become the person he's supposed to be is a story that resonates with all of us. Even if deep-down it is a subtler approach to a superheroes' origin story, the acting, music and writing leave the impression of being much more than that.Despite the lackluster ending, Unbreakable is a beautiful and somewhat realistic interpretation of the genre and it stands out from the trilogy because of this. Take it from someone who does not particularly enjoy Marvel movies, Unbreakable was truly a shocker and a delightful surprise story about overcoming obstacles and finding your place in the world.This film might not be for everyone, but it will certainly give an impression to most. It truly makes you wonder: are there any super-people among us? I can certainly think of a few.",Unbreakable
1130,neovsmatrix,Unbreakable is one of the finest movies in years.,10,23 September 2001,"I guess I can't be too surprised with all the negative responses that Unbreakable is getting.  These days, the masses don't appreciate a buildup of atmosphere, strong character interaction, and stories heavily centered on characters and their psychology.  Unbreakable has all of these traits, and proves to be a superior movie to the Sixth Sense in my opinion.  Too bad it's so underrated.I've seen this movie several times, and I have never even gotten tired of it.  It does deal with comic books, but approaches it with a level of sophistication and intellect never found before in comic book movies.  The movie walks a very fine line between reality and the comic-book world, at the same time walking a very fine line in terms of audience perception. Some chalk it up to be a silly comic-book movie, others a brilliant comic-book movie. And yet, there are still others that maintain Unbreakable's comic book theme does not exactly make it a comic-book movie. It's more of a drama, just like the Sixth Sense was more of a drama than a horror movie.  Both are excellent dramas, but Unbreakable was superior in every aspect.I especially admired the camera movement, and the framing of certain scenes to bring to life an actual comic-book.  I also admired how Unbreakable was very light on dialogue, making full use of subtle gestures, movements, and actions to represent the character's thoughts.  The character's environment plays a similar role and certain colors are often brought up to represent distinct emotions and thoughts the character has.In the end, there are a number of things in this movie that can cause people to quickly denounce the movie, but these are all dependent upon perspective, as there's nothing truly wrong with the movie.  In fact, if viewed objectively and with an open mind, the viewer might be much more apppreciative of Unbreakable.It's clear that many of the posters to this comments area were truly angered by the movie and did not think their thoughts through prior to writing their comments, which is a shame as Unbreakable truly deserves better.  If M. Night Shyamalan's next movie is at least half as good as Unbreakable, I'll definitely be in line to buy a ticket.",Unbreakable
1131,MarcusWL,Unbreakable  the work of a visionary director,9,3 June 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan did it again. After the journey of a man into his past in ""The sixth sense"" he invites us now to join him on a new fascinating trip into a comic book-world, which, nevertheless, reveals so much more about our whole life on earth, then many realistic dramas usually do. The yin and the yang, the good and the evil, the north and the south, so the movie plays and circles about those two opposites sides of one medal. If you regard Willis' role as someone ""godlike"" or as the mysterious warm feeling, that sometimes everyone of us can notice out there. It doesn't really matter to deeply enjoy the movie.Besides this deep philosophical aspect, Shyamalan is not one of those guys, who wanted to push his audience through 90 minutes with, for some people, an overblown message or with the attitude of an intellectual. He likes the small things and sings. For example, the way his characters look at each other or behave in certain situations reveals so much more about their interiors, than words or dialogues could do.You don't have to be a comic book-fan to understand the meaning of ""unbreakable"". And as ""The sixth sense"" the language used in the film is universal and unique. When you notice the tragic of the story (and furthermore the deep humanity that lies beneath it), it's because you share the philosophy of the director and the philosophy of millions of other people.Simply a great masterpiece of art.

I believe he has found his niche in roles such as this, The Sixth Sense, and the Jackal.  Robin Penn Wright's performance is very credible, but oh so different then The Princess Bride, which in reality is how I'll always see her.  To her credit, I did not think of that movie once while watching this one.  My only problem with the acting is in Samuel Jackson's role, but not with his acting.  This may be just me being too used to the over the top nature of his other roles, but I just expected more from his role, but then again, if there was too much from his role it may have overshadowed the rest of the movie.  I do love the fact that Eamonn Walker is given a role in the film, as he is one of my personal favorites.  Technically speaking, a very solid film, that conveys the story well without anything getting in the way of the story.

Those are usually good, so I rented.About 30 minutes into the movie I found it all going smoothly, until they managed, somehow, to transform something somewhat interesting into something completely stupid. They managed to make the movie a ""real-life comic book"" with both a super hero, who does not die unless drowned, and a not-so-super villain, whose only ""powers"" would be his intelligence, which are both incredibly stupid.One of the stupidest part of this movie that I will never forget is when Elijah says something about them (Hero and Villain) being similar because they drink water too fast and they can drown in it (*sigh*).Another incredibly stupid part is by the end when they show that Elijah was actually a not-so-super villain, in a desperate attempt to make a mediocre twist, making the movie even WORSE than I thought possible. Not to mention another stupid part when the Hero saves two kids from a murderer while in a rain suit using incredibly lame camera effects.I voted this movie a 2 and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was a failed attempt to make a Psychological Thriller. This movie seems to be an adult-movie (please note that by ADULT-MOVIE I don't mean pornographic, but simply slow-paced and what many people like to call ""boring"") with a children-movie's story.

However in this case it doesn't really build up to anything. The characters are not very interesting. It's beyond me where people get the ""strong character interaction"" from. I definitely did not find any of that in this movie. At no point in this movie did I feel a connection to any of the characters. Then there is the underlying theme of supernatural powers which in this setting ends up to be a total bore.

This could mean my comment below is based on inaccurate memories- or that my experience so affected me that I feel the need to write a review at 1.44am 7 years later- upon reading some of the other comments extolling this films virtues. I'll leave you to decide.I saw this film at the cinema, and walked out. It, to this day, is the only film I have ever paid to see and decided to put my time to better use. It's truly awful on nearly every level. I remember a scene with Bruce Willis lifting weights- one after the other, in an almost comical depiction of his strength- except I got the distinct impression it was supposed to be serious.If you're the kind of person that really likes comics, and wants to see a film which develops elements of comic book culture which are ever so slightly embarrassing to admit to having any affinity with, you'd maybe find this film watchable. However, I'd recommend you don't watch it in the interests of avoiding further exposure to culturally isolating rubbish.The reason I'm writing this comment is because, I was shocked to see this film had such a high average rating. No other film has managed to get me out of my seat and out of the cinema.

Sadly, this one gets no further than the interesting category.It's a real oddity, owing a huge debt to 'Sixth Sense' in terms of its slow rhythmic pacing and general look. After a while though, the toned down colour and the melancholic mood begin to grate - even bore. The plot doesn't really unfold as it is obvious what will happen from the first fifteen minutes - strangely though (and somewhat unbelievably) it takes Bruce Willis' character much longer to work out what he is, despite the fact that you'd have thought he'd have noticed his apparent indestructibility before reaching the age he is.Nevertheless, the most frustrating thing about it is that it should be a feelgood type of film.

Honestly, I believe if they did not spell out the whole ""Superhero"" thing, this film could have easily been not only great, but one of the best of all-time. If that one portion of the film's plot development was adjusted, this could even perhaps pass M. Night Shyamalan's previous movie, ""The Sixth Sense"".

That's one thing I can perhaps blame myself because of too much used to flashing-edited movies.  But my actual disappointment was the plot.  It is really a very thin plot, apart from the last two minutes, the rest of the film is just a long tedious wait.As I read a lot of SF, my first thought was, that this story was just like one of those short stories (Asimov, Brown, Russell) where the whole story was build to amaze the reader with just the plot-twist in the last sentence.For all those who liked this film, read more books, and you'll find out that this story is not original at all.I gave it a 3/10.

The everyday name of Our Hero; the name of his girlfriend/wife Audrey Inverso (played by Robin Wright), who does inverse the direction Our Hero could have taken in his life; Our Hero's new friend Eijah Price, aka Mr. Glass, played by Samuel Jackson, whom the movie mostly focuses on in the last 2 minutes; all of these are clues to the directors intent.

They form an unlikely bond that sets up their futures.The theme of Unbreakable is discovering who you are. Elijah, played by Samuel L. Jackson, decided who he was in life early on, he was a villain. He creates a few large accidents in order to find his opposite, a hero. David, played by Bruce Willis, not realizing how unbreakable he is, spends the movie discovering his ""abilities"" and just what he is capable of.

Both movies start out with unsuspecting characters that progress and grow as the film does and in the end they know who they are and have to decide what to do with that knowledge.The lighting of the film helps set the mood. The mood in the film is serious as the David and Elijah are figuring out who they are and how they fit in to the world. The film is dark at times of real seriousness, and brightens up in a scene when David feels good about some of his heroic actions. The costumes help with David and Elijah as it makes them more believable. Elijah, the man of glass, uses a cane and later a wheelchair. This adds to the fact that he is easily injured.

1150,kmatchett,M Night Shyamalan - Absolute Genius!,9,1 November 2011,"Before watching Unbreakable, I've seen almost every single Night film, and was amazed how a simple mind could compose such brilliance. I was the ultimate fan of The Sixth Sense, and a quite supporter of The Village, however these films didn't stay with me and excite me as much as other classics, but then Night created Unbreakable. It took me a long time to get round to watch this film, but the wait just made it even more special. this film is unlike any other superhero film. It demonstrates the superhero concept in such a unique, quite and intelligent way that you will be left thinking and amazed by the twist and storyline. once again a superb performance from one of the best in the business - Bruce Willis. His performance perfectly demonstrated the shock and scepticism that would initially hit any normal being in such a scenario; and this was aided by the brilliant direction of Night for all the cast, but Bruce's performance was truly stunning and compelling. Samuel L. Jackson also had a stunning performance as Elijah Price, a comic book enthuasist who initially discovers David Dunn's amazing and unique quality. Also new kid on the block Spencer Treat Clark acted superbly as the son of David, Joseph. Such good acting from a young lad, and is definitely one to look out for in the future. Typical of a Night film, suspense is gradually built up throughout the movie, and this increases the impact at the unbelievable ending of the film. Night made a superb decision by recruiting James Newton Howard as the composer. James created a totally new, unique and simply epic soundtrack for the film, exactly what Night wanted. The soundtrack really helps Night portray the point of the film, and really deepens the impact on the viewer at the end of the movie. Unbreakable is a brilliantly unique film, mainly due to the way that the superhero is portrayed. But the aspect of the film that makes it truly unique and shocking is the typical twisted ending. This ending will literally leave you breathless, due to the unexpected story twist, the excellent acting from Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis, and the superb soundtrack from James Newton Howard. This film will leave you breathless, and will stay with you for a long time after you watch it. Unforgettable! But watching this film will leave you feeling very hollow and a sense of sadness for two simple reasons: Night will never make a film with such an impact like this again, and you will never see a film with the superhero concept portrayed like this again. Quite frankly, 7.3 doesn't do this film justice. Decide for yourself, if you can appreciate a good film, you will most certainly agree with me.",Unbreakable

One of the best Bruce Willis performances, in my modest opinion! The movie is all about contrast: parallel lives, opposite roles and choices. Every scene is built like a page of cartoon ( one can clearly see this in the color contrast) , finishing with a small surprise that revels a bit of what we think is an ordinary man, David Dunn.

The way he has handled the subject is good could have been better if there would have been a little pace added to the film because it was a bit slow. I would like to see more and more such films and If Unbreakable 2 is getting made I would want the director to take the movie on another level if he is continuing with the same story or show now some other 2 people's story.Looking for ward for Unbreakable 2 or similar such films",Unbreakable

The ending of this movie is terrible, evoking no emotions or feelings, other than that you've just been ripped off. It's almost as if the movie builds to a point, forgets where it's going, and tries to tie everything together as quickly and haphazardly as possible.

I feel that this movie is truly underrated and that not enough people know about it, which should be changed. There are many quotes in this movie, especially towards the end that are truly moving.

Having fancy cameras and A-list actors with a flimsy script is not a movie! Movies need stories and stories need substance! Wheres the calamity? Wheres the purpose and direction? Not every superhero movie needs to be some massive production with explosions but there does need to be an arch. This movie lacks purpose. Sure, towards the ending the plot picks up, but it took a very boring, uninspiring, lackluster route to get there.

No super powers, not high tech toys. Just a ""every man"" dealing with an unusual situation and wanting to believe that perhaps he was the sort of man who could make a difference in the world around him.

I particularly enjoyed Samuel L. Jackson performance, who played the main villain. It should be noted, that his character doesn't appear as such until the very ending of the movie. By watching his character you can notice a subtle influence of The Joker. It also shouldn't be forgotten , that this movie precedes Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy by five years and should be credited for creating an ultra-realistic superhero movie for the first time in cinema's history.It also should be mentioned, that films director M. Night Shyamalan has done a brilliant job by effectively combining a gritty realistic story with more comic book like fantasy/superhero plot elements and creating unique deconstruction of superhero genre. One more interesting fact is that although every other superhero movie is heavy on action, there is almost no physical action until the very end of the film, as the film is presented as a psychological mystery thriller and not an action film. It provides a fresh change from other movies of the same type who are relying heavily on special effects but the plot and the character remains forgotten.

1170,jmauritz-103-208467,"Title Does Not Sounding Exciting, But Great Movie",8,18 September 2014,"The film, Unbreakable (2000), Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson reunited in their first film together since Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995). In the film, Bruce Willis plays David Dunn who is a security guard at the university stadium. Samuel L. Jackson plays Elijah Price who is a comic book collector and art gallery owner. Robin Wright Penn plays Audrey Dunn, David Dunn's wife.In the opening scenes, the audience discovers that during childbirth, Elijah Price sustained multiple fractures and the David Dunn is involved in a train crash in which he is the sole survivor, and sustains no injuries. Elijah has a genetic disorder, which makes his bones easy to break. During his lifetime, he had 54 broken bones. As the story continues, Elijah seeks out David. Elijah's hope is if there was someone like him, who breaks very easy, there is someone who does not break. Much like the film, Cider House Rules and the character Homer Wells, the theme of this film is the coming of age/growing awareness. As the film progresses David starts to realize that he has superhuman powers and starts to explore these powers. Whereas in the beginning of the film, David was content with existing and doing his job, by the end of the film he has a purpose. The theme of coming of age and David's growing awareness has come full circle by the end of the film.Throughout the film the use of special effects, such as sound, lighting, and focus are used, though some are subtle, these special effects add to the mystic of David realizing his powers. In one scene in the train station, David is standing in the middle of the train station while people are walking by and brushing up against him. He can ""see"" what the person has done previously. The use of lighting and sound in this scene lets the audience know that the scene is about to change to show what the person has done. In another scene, the use of focus brings the scene together. In the scene, Elijah is talking to a prospective customer and the focus is on a particular piece of art as Elijah talks the focus of the scene changes from the art piece to the reflection in the glass of Elijah and the prospective customer.This film is a great film. I had never heard of the film until I received it as a gift on DVD. The title does not sound too exciting, but once you get pass the title and discover who is in the film and the plot of the film, the film is worth watching.",Unbreakable
1171,timoauge,a missed opportunity for a great movie,7,1 January 2015,"Let me start of by saying that i love the movie and am very disappointed with it! the basic idea as in a lot of Shyamalan movies is outstanding and very philosophical but it misses out so much in the ability to translate that message. trying to portrait the human need to find purpose in life through a subtle, complex and vulnerable ""super hero story"" is a great contrast at first sight. but originally thats what comic books were about. dealing with important political and philosophical questions in a context the common cowed could understand and empathizes with. and in a century were comic book movies mostly became nothing but pure stupid ""popcorn cinema"" i admire the effort to remind people that comic books and movies can very well have true and meaningful content. However, while the concept of ""Unbreakable"" is ambitious and set for greatness, i feel it severely lacks love for detail. there is hardly any story that give the message of the movie any body. the movie is not able to attach the viewer to any of the characters really. and while at first there is a certain tension to what is the secret about these two characters, the initiate tension doesn't build up any further. on the contrary, i feel the longer the movie goes on the more it loses its original tension, to the point were the viewer almost loses interest. and then the big ""plot twist"" the main thing about the movie doesn't contribute to any excitement either, its not really part of the arc of tension either its just dished out at the end leaving the viewer with this great but almost not utilized message about a basic human desire.",Unbreakable

The Big name stars Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis do nothing to save this film where absolutely nothing happens!!! The script is destroyed by lines such as ""When was the last time I was sick?"" This film says that it is supposed to be a suspense thriller. It isn't. The only suspense is ""can this movie get any worse?"" The answer is yes. Introducing the bad guy played by Samuel L Jackson, the king of bad-ass characters who plays a man who breaks his bones extremely easily, and never fights Bruce Willis! Come on - Who ever heard of a villain with very weak bones, especially him??? Willis only fights some random man, who only turns up in the last 5 minutes after doing the square root of nothing apart from lifting weights with paint cans attached. The best scene is when Willis' child is pointing his gun at him, and that scene is just stupid. This film was directed by M Night Shyamalan, and this film just sums up his directing capabilities. If you like suspense thrillers, maybe you might like this film but if you are like me and like a heck of a load of action, then think before watching this film or else you will find you have wasted 106 minutes of your time on a bore-fest where the only action is Willis strangling a random man.",Unbreakable

When it comes to character building and laying out a believable plot, Shyamalan is truly a genius of sorts! I am one of the few who actually loved the Village a lot along with all of his other films, and I believe that it has a lot to do with the fact that his films are so compelling.In so many words, the film is about a security guard named David Dunn and his slow realization that he is in fact a superhero! From those words alone, this film sounds like a cheesy 2 star summer action flick, but trust me, it certainly is not. In my opinion, Bruce Willis, and Sameul L Jackson turned in amazing performances. I was especially moved at how convincing Samuel L Jackson's take on O.I. was. If you ask me, the only real reason that the critics bashed this film is because it took a chance and did something creative with an otherwise stale story.

The directing was top class, enjoyed the uniqueness of some shots and the many close ups showing Bruce Willis's deep emotions as he suffers endlessly throughout the film. The supportive roles from his wife and child are second to none too, I think Mr Willis knows how to bring the best out of child actors!

M. Night Shyamalan played the lottery by seducing his audience into believing his world hidden wonder and boy did he win the jackpot. He dramatizes a superhero's origin story in the real world accompanied to the sublime soundtracks of James Newton Howard and such gripping understated cinematography as to leave the viewer reaching in to cast off those 'real world' lead weights and voluntarily floating off into his world of wonder. That the dialogue throughout the movie between Bruce Willis' and Samuel L. Jackson's characters is based on the significance of comics alone would render this film an instant cult-classic following.

Forget frivolous expensive special effects - Shyamalan has created a masterpiece!,Unbreakable
1180,camero-39016,More than I expected,9,31 July 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan does an amazing job of slowly revealing the characters of this film. Elijah (Samuel Jackson) and David (Bruce Willis) are learning about themselves through how different they are from each other. David is the sole survivor of a disaster that kills hundreds of people. His survival sparks the interest of Elijah, which leads to him telling David that he could be gifted. This comic book themed movie shows the rise of a hero searching for a deeper purpose in his life. Like most comic book movies, there is always a ""Back Story"" that causes some change in the characters. This change turns them into the individual they currently are. Shyamalan does an amazing job of developing the characters played by Jackson and Willis. This movie moves slowly, concentrating on the drama of the film. The dialog and relationships between the characters play a huge part in the film. You could miss that this is a comic themed movie if you don't pay attention to the subtle details. You could even miss that Elijah's mother says, ""This one has a surprise ending."" When she gives her son is first comic book. This movie gets better with each time you watch it. The more I watched, the more I noticed the Comic related details hidden in the film. This movie is done in a way, that almost makes you believe the events are possible. It seems realistic because it is so dark, and doesn't have an unnecessary comedic element. It is more like The Dark Knight than a whimsical hero movie, like Spider-Man. Because of the fact that we live in a world of terrorism and mass killings because of radical beliefs. It does not seem extremely ridiculous to image a twisted genius with a rare disease, could be searching for a gifted human. There are also references made to ancient Egyptians. Comparing Egyptian wall writings to current day Comic Books. Elijah argues that comics are just exaggerations of actual people from history. The idea of people with extraordinary abilities is not a new concept. We find these tales being told in the Bible and amongst the ancient Greeks. Samuel Jackson's ability to deliver these compelling arguments as Elijah, will almost make you a believer. You will be pulled into the movie and consider the possibility of superhuman individuals living in the real world.With upside-down images, Dramatic shots without music, long pauses in dialog, and a very M. Night Shyamalan style ending. Similar to The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan adds a huge reveal that shocks the viewer.

1183,leeh-03147,about unbreakable,10,25 October 2017,"SPOILER FILLEDUnbreakable(2000) starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright, was a courageous act of audacity by M. Night Shyamalan; portraying a risky story that could've or partly did, disappoint audiences. With a great burden of the success: Six Sense, the movie in which brought a completely anonymous name to the Hollywood box office, Shyamalan gave us another taste of his originality that left me with unequivocal bewilderment. This truly is a one of a kind director that shows his boldness in ways that are impossible to see today. With incredibly high expectations from both critics and audiences, Shyamalan does it again with the movie Unbreakable.What if superman was on earth and didn't know he was super? (- Quentin Tarantino) This truly is the perfect equation for this movie. Unbreakable goes under the genres of drama, mystery, thriller; but genuinely, it's an origin story for a super hero. This movie starts with a doctor frantically sweating as he examines a newborn infant. He soon concludes that the infant has broke all his arms and legs just from coming out of the womb. This abrupt start gave a thrilling chill to me and a great taste of how the movie was going to lay out. As the movie proceeds we soon learn that this infant is Elijah(Samuel L Jackson). The next scene occurs in a train with Bruce Willis's character David Dunn. A few minutes pass with this man and we learn all that we need to know about our protagonist; with an excess of one of the best cinematography and original camera work I've ever seen. We learn that David has problems with his marriage, has a fear of water, and quit football a long time ago. These characteristics which seem irrelevant soon lay out to be the fundamental roots of the problems that David faces. The scene fades to black and judging from the sirens, we assume the train has crashed. To our surprise, David is alive without a single scratch; the sole survivor. He returns home dumbfounded and resumes his days as a security guard in a football stadium. Elijah soon approaches him and questions if David has ever been hurt. This question haunts David until he finally accepts to talk to Elijah. Elijah owns a comic store and is passionate about them. Shyamalan did a perfect job filling each characters with so much depth as there is a scene when Elijah scowls at a customer for trying to buy one of his ""arts"" for a kid in purposes that disturbed Elijah's moral beliefs. The script of this movie shows layers and layers way beneath the surface of a character and portrays them with such original passages and scenes. Proceeding, Elijah's statement is that if there is a being like him, that can break his bones so easily, there must be a being the complete opposite. Here lies the first hidden plot of this movie. Shyamalan is already hinting the similarities of the characters by referencing their direct opposite differences. This brought to the movie an outpouring of realism; almost to the point of forgetting this is a superhero movie. Time passes and David starts to believe in Elijah as more sequences ensue. As you probably guessed, Elijah and David become friends for helping each other find their true places in the world and the movie comes to an end as David finally becomes what he was destined to be. The ending twist of the movie was a huge surprise as it was a huge disappoint to the people at the time. The ending shows Elijah as the main antagonist of the movie. After a few minutes of Shyamalan's authentic flashbacks and dialogue, it just makes sense. Everything makes sense. The reason why Elijah's character is so full of detail and magnificently intricate, why they're both described as opposites and so much more of the main plots of the movie just comes out of the shadows and dazzles us in such perfectly edited shots. Elijah had planned all the catastrophes to find the right hero that can give him a meaning; a true meaning in existing; as Mr. Glass, the rival or enemy as Elijah states. Elijah's final words are that he finally has a place in all of it and even true enemies which have the most distinguishable differences can also be the friends. Regardless of what any of the critics said at the time; comparing this movie with six sense even though they were completely distant movies, Unbreakable is an undeniably marvelous movie and it is Shyamalan telling you to find your place in the world, whether a superhero or a villain, everyone has a role in this world. You just have to find it, deep inside your heart.",Unbreakable
1184,karaiskakis-58294,It's great!,9,12 January 2019,"Spoiler for another Shyamalan movie so when i change paragraph stop reading! I only give it nine out of ten because no movie deserves 10. Every movie has a flaw. Even though i love this movie i can find one or two flaws, but there are so little and so not important. After saying this Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies of all time! It's direction? Masterful. Its script? So great!!! The acting? Freakin fabulus! Its a masterpiece of our time in my opinion! Shyamalan is one of the best directors working today! Really, the only movie of his that I dont like is The Last Aurbender and After Earth which I perconally hate! I love this movie more than the sixth sence i think it is a better movie than the sixth sence allthough i also love it.Just watch the movie and then watch split ok? These movies are connected!

It brought shivers down my spine when Mr Glass (Samuel L Jackson) revealed his true identity to David Dunn (Bruce Willis) at the end of the movie. It was sensational!!! I truly would like and to support everyone else opinion who loved this movie to continue on his voyage thorugh life e.g his son, wife, Mr GLass and/or any other potentials worthy of the movie.A MUST!

1186,krillesandberg,Everyday life as a metaphor.,10,14 August 2006,"Unbreakable is a film about a troubled and slightly depressed security guard who. after being the sole survivor of a train wreck, reluctantly begins to understand that there is something very special about him The best thing about Unbreakable is that it uses everyday life events, people, actions, words and feelings to interpret the comic book world for us. That special skill is a trademark for Mr Night. As seen in both Signs and Lady in the water, the same kind of everyday usage to explain something that is beyond the everyday life, is Moore of an impacting trademark, then the surprise ending deal. Unbreakable is something as unusual as a ""kitchen realism-superhero saga, with all that belongs in such a tale. We have got the ""missunderstood"" and troubled man who's efforts to to good pushes him in the opposite direction. We have our superhero, skilled and best friends with his nemesis, a common theme in comic books. And we have got, a weakness in the hero, a costume, a discovery of powers, a ""brute villain"". everything is there, dressed in a everyday life. This is the beauty of the film, and M. Night does not store away from this aspect one millimeter'.",Unbreakable
1187,manicsweetpreachers,"Unbreakable, not AF",9,13 February 2006,"A tantalising movie from the critically acclaimed director M. Night Shymalan, staying away from massive effects which were a big in Hollywood at the time of the movie, this movie was shadowed by other Bruce Willis flicks such as Armageddon made around this time, this ain't for people with low IQ or bad attention spans, for some you made need to think too follow. Using A good mixture of acting. Willis and Jackson create a mesmerising movie. Using a comic book superhero attitude to the movie it shows to everyone there is an opposite for everyone, where someone who is breakable there is someone who must be unbreakable.",Unbreakable
1188,akshatchat,Watching unbreakable will BREAK you!,1,8 January 2019,"When I began watching the movie, the beginning seemed to be nice, then as you continue watching it turns to bearable and after 30 minutes it is but nothing a loathsome farrago of pointless scenes based on a worthless script. The movie remains stagnant and moves at the pace of a snail. Although there is a twist in the end, it isn't worth wasting 1 hour 40 minutes of your life. This movie has NO connection with split.",Unbreakable
