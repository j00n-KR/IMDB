0,Leofwine_draca,"Poor, very poor",4,19 September 2015,"What we have here is a Mexican cartel drug thriller from director Oliver Stone. What could go wrong with that? The film is dripping with sun-bleached style, and there's plenty of violence and sex in the mix. A shame, then, that the script is so very predictable and makes huge and continuous mistakes throughout, leaving this a failure of a movie.The first problem with the film is the entire lack of likable characters. Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch are the most vapid and unlikeable leads ever; they follow in the line of the usual pothead dummy heroes (as in American ULTRA and PINEAPPLE EXPRESS) and I hated both of them from the very beginning. Blake Lively's character is rubbish, a typical air-head blonde, and the viewer is forced to sit through her extended screen time for no little reason other than to pad the story out.Which leads me into the running time: this is way too long for what should be a tense and exciting thriller. Lots of it feels repetitive or boring. There are a few action highlights, but the overall mood is artificial and long-winded. John Travolta gives the best performance in his minor role as a corrupt drugs agent, but check out Salma Hayek's cartel boss; she's surprisingly terrible. And I'm still not sure what to make of Benicio del Toro's character, and I don't think the scriptwriters knew what to do with him either...",Savages
1,SnoopyStyle,more flash than substance,6,25 August 2013,"Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) coexist in a drug filled love triangle with O (Blake Lively). They become successful high grade weed dealers north of the border. Their lives get complicated when the Mexican Baja Cartel leader Elena (Salma Hayek) muscles in on their business.Oliver Stone is putting all his skills into making a flashy crime action. But it just seem more flash than substance. Mind you, I appreciate the flash. There isn't anything original to the story. Certainly Oliver Stone has done better. Yep, there is definitely better Oliver Stone works out there.",Savages
2,Prismark10,An Oliver Stone joint,5,23 May 2016,"Twenty years ago an Oliver Stone film would be an event but the director has become wayward of late.This marks a return to form but it revisits his screenplay of Scarface too much in places. Also aided with his kinetic camera work and filming style used in Natural Born Killers but here it hinders the flow.Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is peace loving hippy Buddhist and his best buddy Chon (Taylor Kitsch) a former soldier have developed the best type of marijuana which have made them successful in southern California.Both also share the same woman Ophelia (Blake Lively) and life is going swimmingly until the Mexican Baja Cartel demands that they join forces with them and later kidnap Ophelia.The cartel is ruthlessly led by Elena (Salma Hayek) her brutal enforcer Lado (Benicio Del Toro) wants Elena but also realises he needs to make his own moves.Ben and Chon realise they need to take on the cartel and free Ophelia and they can only do this with the help of the slippery and crooked DEA agent (John Travolta) a man who has worked out all the angles.The film is hampered by the constant narration by Lively as well as her performance which is less than lively. She certainly looks like someone who could enchant two best friends but she can never mesmerise the audience.Kitsch's character is one dimensional, just a gung ho grunt which leaves Johnson to make up for the shortcomings of the two main leads. At least his character is more subtle, learning the hard way that being involved in the drugs trade does not go hand in hand with being a peace loving beatnik. He has to toughen up and gets his hands bloody.The film works mainly because of the supporting actors. Hayek, Travolta (with his natural balding hairline) Bichir and Del Toro make the most of their thin characterisations, people who are rooted to their families despite being savages.Stone makes up for the rest with his filming style with an operatic approach to violence but why were we presented with an alternate version of the climax?",Savages
3,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Adventure,7,5 July 2013,"In California, the former Navy SEAL Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and his best friend, the peaceful botanist Ben (Aaron Johnson) are successful entrepreneurs producing and dealing high-quality weed. Chon brought seeds from Afghanistan and Ben used his knowledge to develop the best marijuana in the country. Chon and Ben share the pothead lover Ophelia (Blake Lively) and she loves both of them since they complete each other - Chon is a powerful and strong lover and Ben is a sensible and loving lover.Their comfortable life changes when the Mexican Baja Cartel demands a partnership in their business. Chon and Ben refused the deal and the leader of the cartel Elena (Salma Hayek) sends her right-arm in America, Lado (Benicio Del Toro), to abduct Ophelia to press the American drug dealers. Chon and Bend ask the support of the dirty DEA Agent Dennis (John Travolta) and get inside information to begin a secret war against the Baja Cartel to release Ophelia. ""Savages"" is an entertaining adventure about a war between drug dealers. The plot is a sort joke with the modernization of ""Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid"", with two charming drug dealers and one gorgeous mistress. Inclusive there is a reference to this movie when O is talking to Chen and Ben after a threesome. And maybe this is the greatest flaw of the plot, with apology for drugs and giving glamor to two drug dealers and one promiscuous woman. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Selvagens"" (""Savages"")",Savages
4,nogodnomasters,Your wives and your children,8,17 January 2018,"Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is an ex-Navy SEAL. He grows some fine pot with his close friend and botanist Ben (Aaron Johnson). They share a girlfriend in Ophelia (Blake Lively) who fills in the plot points with narration and claims just because she is telling the story doesn't mean she will be alive at the end. I found her story telling irritating at times.As fate would have it, the evil Mexican cartel wants to combine businesses. Our guys tell them, they want out, and they can have the whole thing. The Mexicans didn't like that answer. In order to ensure cooperation the cartel kidnaps Ophelia as the guys form a rescue plan. Ben must quickly learn to kill without the aid of any training or a music montage. Our heroes must walk a fine line between disrupting the cartel while working for them.I liked Oliver Stone more when he made his historical films with a ""truthiness"" aspect to them. Now he thinks he is Tarantino. The film was certainly watchable and made very well. I believe it was beneath Stone to have done the film. The ending I thought was a mess and needed better developing...but at the same time if Tarantino did it, it would be genius. This is a love it or hate it type of film. I will take the middle ground.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bombs, sex, nudity, brief rape, torture.",Savages
5,kosmasp,Heightened reality,8,6 May 2013,"Or is it? After all it is just a movie. A drama, a thriller, an action movie ... you name it, this could be it. But is it good enough for your taste? Have you come to expect better or less from an Oliver Stone movie? That is really tough to answer, especially because this movie might have lost a lot of ""points"" because of the way it ends. With the type of ending you know, you will get into trouble with some people.But that is nothing that worries Oliver Stone. The beginning of the movie sees a very steamy scene featuring Blake Lively. Some may argue about her acting abilities (at least as a leading lady), but since I don't feel the movie is a drama, I did not have a problem with her or anyone else in it. What I really liked, was the fact, that no one tried to be cool. You have that thing, were movies get made, were you feel how hard they try to pretend to be cool or something else, but they just can't capture that. Not a problem here.Still not Stones best movie (by far) or best amongst its peers, but a good movie to watch nevertheless.",Savages
6,jboothmillard,Savages,5,3 April 2013,"I noticed this film because of the bright DVD cover and having a fair number of good stars in it, but then I noticed it was directed by Oliver Stone (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers), so I was keen to see whether it would be as good as the title sounded. Basically in Laguna Beach, California, Ophelia 'O' Sage (Green Lantern's Blake Lively) is in shared relationship with best friends, former Navy SEAL Chon (John Carter's Taylor Kitsch) and University of California, Berkeley graduate Ben (Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and together the boys also run a lucrative marijuana production. A problem arises though when the Mexican Baja Cartel, led by merciless head Elena (Salma Hayek) and her enforcer Lado (Benicio Del Toro), demand a partnership with them, and even with advice from corrupt DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) they do not give into the threats to go with, and makes plans to go to Indonesia. But O gets kidnapped by the cartel, and via a Skype call again demand that they partner with them, but Chon and Ben decide to rebel against the cartel, starting with the murders of seven of Elena's men, and getting member Alex (Demián Bichir) framed. While torturing another member of the cartel the duo get information about Elena's teenage daughter Magdalena 'Magda' Sánchez (Sandra Echeverria), and meanwhile O may be incarcerated, but Elena feeling sorry for her gets into meaningful conversations with her, but then O gets raped by Lado. After paying Dennis $3 million for information about Magda and kidnapping her, they play Elena at her own game and threaten to hurt her daughter if they do not return O to them, so they set up a meeting point for both parties to release their captives in the middle of the desert. The exchange happens, and Elena demands to know who gave the information about her daughter, the boys say it was Lado, and she attempts to kill him but she shoots her first, and this becomes a firefight, Chon is shot several times, and Lado is killed by O, but not before he got to kill Ben. But this sequence ends and is actually O imagining the events, in reality the exchange is made, Lado steals the car and drives away, and Elena and the cartel are arrested, and Dennis gets Chon and Ben out of jail saying that they are accomplices from the last six years, and they and their shared girlfriend go to live like ""savages"" in Indonesia. Also starring Emile Hirsch as Spin, Shea Whigham as Chad, Gary Stretch as Bad Ass Biker and Mía Maestro as Dolores. The two young male leads are alright as the anti-heroes trying to get their girlfriend, Lively as the girl kidnapped and having a philosophical view, I wondered about the casting of Hayek but actually she is a good choice as the bitch and leader of the bad guys, Del Toro could have slightly more to do than just look thuggish, and Travolta too as the authority wasn't on much. The story of a three-way story, the kidnap story and the kidnap versus kidnap idea are all interesting and with some originality, I admit the drug business stuff slowed it down slightly, but it is picked back up with the action filled gun sequences and some black humour included, it is an alright crime drama.

8,LeonLouisRicci,Highly Stylized Post Modern Palette,7,19 December 2012,"There is an unwritten rule floating around Moviedom, for anything but a Chic Flick never use a female for voice over narration. It's hard to quantify but it just does not work. Anyway, aside from that irritant, this is the usual visually stunning, take it or leave it style from one of our maverick Directors. He is loved and hated in tandem. Oliver Stone is a daring filmmaker that pushes boundaries and barrages the senses so, like it or not, it makes you pay attention.This can work to advantage, and not. Because if you pay too much attention to his playful, violent vision it can be distracting trying to get meaning out of meaninglessness. This is a romp. Nothing more than a highly stylized post-modern palette of ultra-violence, sex, drugs, and hipster music.This was made before the 2012 election and that makes the DEA agent's remark, ""it's only a matter of time before its legal, so take the money and run"", stand out and although not exactly a profound statement, it is like the rest of this, nothing more than ""attractive"" action and ""fun"" escapism for those in the groove.",Savages
9,zardoz-13,Terrific Marijuana Caper Thriller!,10,24 December 2013,"Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of the ""Kick Ass"" movies) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch of ""John Carter"") are two marijuana dealers in sunny Laguna Beach, California, who grow the best pot in the world. Ben is a botanist, and Chon is a former U.S. soldier. These two friends live together and share the same girlfriend, Ophelia (Blake Lively of ""Green Lantern""),without any drama. They have the world by the tits until the Mexican Cartel decides to make them an offer that they cannot refuse. Our amoral anti-heroes received a blood-soaked video with images of decapitated heads and a business meeting to discuss their future. Ben is willing to talk, but Chon wants to terminate the Mexicans with extreme prejudice. Meantime, stone-cold tough guy Lado (Benicio Del Toro of ""License to Kill"")serves Elana (Salma Hayek of ""Desperado"") who runs the business that her husband operated until he was killed. When our heroes prove obstinate, Elana kidnaps O to ramp up the negotiations with Ben and Chon. Eventually, Ben and Chon take the war to the enemy and screw around with Elana. They go one step farther and persuade their favorite DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta of ""Pulp Fiction"") to accommodate them with top-secret, hush-hush, information about Elana. While all of this is unfolding, O--who has been abducted by Lado--gets to meet Elana, and they become friends. It turns out that Elana has an estranged daughter, Madga (Sandra Echeverría of ""Casa de mi Padre) living in Southern California, and our heroes kidnap her and turn the tables on Elana. Lado shows up at Dennis' house and they discuss the situation and Dennis survives. Lado utilizes a lawn cutting business as a way of getting his armed and deadly Mexicans into any house and raising havoc. The really cool thing about ""Savages"" is that it is narrated by 0, but she points out that just because she is telling us everything that she isn't dead herself. Oliver Stone is an above-average director with attitude and he makes ""Savages"" an engaging film to watch, right up to its double-ending that may blow your mind. Don Winslow's novel is pretty gripping material, but scenarist Shane Solerno and Stone have taken liberties with it.",Savages
10,grantss,Nothing special,5,4 October 2015,"Nothing special. Plot just rambles along, with a few holes and inconsistencies in it. At no stage do you feel engaged by or empathy with the lead characters. Just intriguing enough to keep you interested. Oliver Stone's direction is solid though, especially considering the script and some of the actors he had to work with.Movies is marred by the lead performances, all by relatively unknown/B- grade actors. Blake Lively and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are out of their depth in the movie - both performances are weak and unconvincing. Taylor Kitsch is mostly OK though. Supporting cast is where the big names are: Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro, John Travolta. Hayek and Del Toro give the most compelling performances of the movie - gritty and convincing. Travolta is irritating, trying too hard to be smooth and cool.",Savages
11,Boba_Fett1138,Definitely has its moments.,7,20 July 2012,"Ever since Oliver Stone stopped writing his own movies, his movies have been some incredibly mediocre ones, this one included. But mediocre still is far from the same as saying that it's also being a bad movie of course.It's definitely far from a great movie but as a genre movie it serves its purpose well enough and also has some pretty good moments in it. It's flaws and writing prevent this movie from ever becoming a true must-see but it simply remains a good movie to watch, especially for those who are into these type of crime-thrillers, involving drug cartels.It's not being the best written movie but I also do admit that it's not being the best told movie as well. The movie was definitely lacking some focus and too often was all over the place with its different characters and the movie didn't always had a good and pleasant flow to it. Besides, it was lacking some good, likable main characters. I mean, no matter how you look at it, the main characters are still some criminals, who are not afraid to get their hands dirty and know very well they are breaking the law. I just had a hard time liking them for what they were and therefore also never felt involved with anyone of them, causing me also to never feel involved with the movie or get grabbed by any of its tension, emotions and plot developments.The movie is also going at some weird places with its story at times and keeps changing directions. The one moment its being a crime-thriller, the other a romantic-drama and the other it suddenly turns into a typical, over-the-top action flick. You could say that the movie keeps surprising you but it doesn't exactly do this in the most convincing or entertaining way.I wasn't too fond about its lead actors but luckily the movie does still have a solid supporting cast. Benicio Del Toro is always good in this sort of roles and it was nice to see Salma Hayek as a tough 'villain' for a change. John Travolta also shows that he can still be cool in movie and age doesn't hinder him.This movie movie might still disappoint some Oliver Stone's fans but overall this is being a good genre movie, that still has some hints of a great movie in it. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Savages

Oliver Stone's slash-and-burn return to form in this pulp fiction adaptation of Don Winslow's novel (they collaborated on the killer screenplay) is a lover's triangle of a poor little rich girl and her pot-growing entrepreneurs buds (grunt Kitsch and peacenik Johnson, the yin and yang) who find themselves submitted to the wrath of a Mexican drug cartel ruled with ruthless abandon by Hayek (never been better or sexier and having a ball) when they refuse to partner up resulting in a kidnapping and a trail of blood- soaked revenge and double-crossing (enter corrupt DEA fed Travolta in a lip-smacking supporting role). Del Toro is truly memorable as the brutal enforcer of Hayek's with no remorse for his evil and devours every scene he's in with palpable menace. Energized, action-packed and cooler than a Tarantino buzz.",Savages
13,neil-476,The central flaw is only one of several,7,26 September 2012,"Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson) have a cottage industry growing high-class marijuana in California. Chon brought the seeds back from Afghanistan where he served with the armed forces. Ben uses the profits to fund humanitarian third-world projects. They live with Ophelia aka O (Blake Lively) in contented polygamy (or, to be correct, polyandry). Into this blissful scenario comes a Mexican drug cartel headed by Elena (Salma Hayek) and Lado (Benicio Del Toro), her strong right arm who is happy to carry out errands such as decapitating people with a chainsaw to set an example. Elena requires our boys to go into partnership with her or else etc. etc., and, before they can leg it on the advice of DEA agent on the take Dennis (John Travolta), Elena has O kidnapped to ensure their willing cooperation.So we're looking at a hardboiled crime thriller featuring a good cast. Unfortunately, it also features Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, and a central problem. Kitsch and Lively continue to operate within their own personal charisma-free zones. Kitsch brings no subtlety to his hard-nosed vet, and Lively - whose general wishy-washiness doesn't matter too much since O is pretty wishy-washy herself - is saddled with delivering a voice-over which is a) never convincing, b) immensely irritating, and c) largely unnecessary. This, in turn, ties into the fundamental problem at the heart of this movie, which is the warm loving relationship between the Gang of Three. How do we know it's a warm loving relationship? Because O's voice-over tells us so, repeatedly, and because we see them engaged in a threesome. We see some caressing, but it doesn't really tell us what's at the heart of their relationship - we never know why they are so lovey-dovey. Oliver Stone should know better - isn't the first lesson in film-making to show, not tell? There is quite a lot of plot in this movie - possibly too much, possibly not - and some vicious action (the movie is called Savages, after all). It poses an interesting question - who are the Savages - the cartel, or Chon and Ben who are forced to act with equal savagery? But then it never really addresses it. There is a degree of pretension - the symbolism of Ophelia is given full horrendous flight in an ending (one of two, pick which one you like best) which emulates the close of Hamlet in the number of bodies left lying around. And it carries far too many flamboyant pop video visual distractions.It is possible to see the potential which was in this project at the start. That potential is, at best, only partially realised.The book, incidentally, features some first-rate writing.",Savages
14,ferguson-6,But he's such a nice drug dealer,5,12 July 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. I guess this qualifies as director Oliver Stone returning to his dark side. Based on Don Winslow's novel, it certainly has the foundation to be a complex, down-and-dirty, twisted plot, double-crossing, love triangle, ultra-violent, drug-dealing smörgåsbord. And while it possesses all of those elements, it still manages to come across as some slick Michael Mann cable TV project.The film begins with narration from O (Blake Lively) who tells us that just because she is telling us this story, doesn't mean she is alive at the end. Huh?? She also tells us that she is in love with two drug-dealing buddies. Yes, both of them. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is the ex-Seal and muscle in the business. Ben (Aaron Johnson) is the gifted botanist who turns the Afghan seeds into the most potent pot in southern California. Oh, and Ben is the ultimate philanthropist drug dealer. He builds schools in third world countries and invests in clean energy. After what felt like an eternity, the narration finally ended and I could stop yelling ""Shut up, O"" at the screen.One day the boys receive a video via email. It's an invitation to a business meeting with the Mexican Baja Drug cartel. Suffice to say that the video contained no balloons or party animals. It was more of a warning about what happens if you choose not to do business with us. The cartel front men are played by Demian Bichir (fresh off A Better Life) and Benecio Del Toro (MIA since The Wolfman). The queen of the cartel is Elena, played by Salma Hayak. Throw in a corrupt DEA agent, playing both sides against each other, portrayed by John Travolta and all the pieces are in place for real fireworks once O is kidnapped.The rest of the movie is pretty much the war you would expect with some poor negotiation skills tossed in for fun. Overacting is the word of the day, especially from Travolta, Ms. Hayak and Emile Hirsch (money man). Still not sure what to make of Ms. Lively (The Town). The camera certainly loves her but it's too early to tell if she has staying power as an actress. The only character that is really fun to watch is Lado, played by Del Toro. He is truly a frightening guy who also happens to have a deceptive mind on how to take over from the weak.The whole good versus evil story line really only works if one side is good and one side is evil. If the good side (Ben) is a drug-dealer in a love triangle with his best friend, it's much more difficult to muster empathy. Otherwise, when the mandatory hostage/money exchanges occur, we really aren't invested in the characters ... and the action takes center stage. That's the sign of a forgettable movie with no real heart.",Savages
15,anaconda-40658,Oliver Stone's Savage Film.,8,13 July 2015,"Savages (2012): Dir: Oliver Stone / Cast: Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson, Blake Lively, Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro: The title pretty much sums up the greed every single character in this film lives by. Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson play two successful dope manufacturers who share a girlfriend. The three of them live in their own doped up illusion of paradise until a larger competitor desires to partner with them. Kitsch fought in the Iraq war and feels no threat, whereas Johnson desires to leave the business. When an agreement is not met, their lives are threatened with the kidnapping of their girlfriend. This is a brutal film echoing Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers or U-Turn. This becomes pointless with scenes of torture where eye balls dangle from sockets. This level of violence can reduce one's faith in the director's faith in his own material. Stone has an eye for detail and the screenplay examines these relationships effectively although the double climax nearly kills the film with its laughable impact. Kitsch and Johnson are effective. Kitsch is fearless and determined with confident military backing. Johnson is paranoid but focused during negotiations. Blake Lively plays the caged girlfriend, drugged yet manages to engage a dinner conversation with the ruthless Madam, played by Salma Hayek whose daughter detests her illegal lifestyle, and she sees an attachment with Lively. Benicio Del Toro plays Hayek's ruthless henchman whose methods are deplorable and brutal. The film demonstrates the reality of such business can resort, and the paradise delusion conceal its savage reality. Score: 8 / 10",Savages
16,phd_travel,Compelling story and interesting characters,9,20 September 2012,"The story is good, unpredictable and not far fetched. The Baja drug cartel make two small time drug producers an offer they can't refuse and kidnap their girlfriend. Liked the black humor that runs through the story.There are likable characters on both sides of the battle. All the actors are well used. Blake Lively is finally in a big screen role that suits her well. Her loose living California girl and narrator is both amusing and lovely to watch. John Travolta's slimy crooked cop is just right. Salma the drug lord is quite darkly amusing. Benicio's face does all the work. The two good friends who share everything are well played by Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson who are both kind of uglied up for the roles.The violence is very graphic but it's contained to certain scenes and you know when it's coming and can choose to close your eyes. Both the sex scenes and the violence make this for mature audiences.Overall a good plot driven kind of feel good thriller with a stand out cast.",Savages
17,gradyharp,'Just because I'm telling you this story....doesn't mean I'm alive at the end of it.',5,19 November 2012,"We are all savages, no matter how we attempt to disguise it. Oliver Stone has brought some brilliant films to the screen - Platoon, Wall Street, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, Born on the Fourth of July, Natural Born Killers, Nixon, W., Heaven and Earth, World Trade Center, etc - and it is with the expectation that his current film will live up to those standards that most viewers commit to the 147 minutes of SAVAGES. The film is long on gore and drugs, delivers some rather caricatures of ideas (Benicio Del Toro, Selma Hayak, John Travolta) and waste a lot of time on inconsequential things. But the story itself has some merit, though it has been done many times before: the drug market can turn people into savages.Entrepreneurs Ben (Aaron Johnson), a peaceful and charitable marijuana producer, and friend Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a macho, hunky, rough former Navy SEAL, run a lucrative, homegrown industry - raising some of the best weed ever developed. They also share a one-of-a-kind love with Ophelia (Blake Lively) in a three-way romance. Life is an idyllic triad in their Southern California town of Laguna Beach ... until the Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move in and demands that the trio partners with them. When the merciless head of the BC, Elena (Salma Hayek) and her enforcer, Lado (Benicio Del Toro), underestimate the unbreakable bond of the three friends, Ben and Chon - with the reluctant assistance of a dirty DEA agent (John Travolta) in cahoots with El Azul (Joaquín Cosio) - wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills involving the kidnapping of Ophelia as well as the kidnapping of Elena's daughter. Throw in cameos by Emile Hirsch, Demián Bichir, and what seems to be a cast of thousands, top it off by a cutesy ending suggested by the opening lines of the film, and try to get past the boring voice over storytelling by Blake lively and settle in to the gore of beheadings, and other gruesome events and you have Oliver Stone's latest. The film as its moments but it goes on far too long and doesn't have the class of the original novel by Don Winslow (who surprisingly shows up as a screenwriter!). For those who love gore and some fine actors doing a turn for the money, join in. Grady Harp",Savages

Stone's movie is a portrayal of California 1960's idealism of free love, the 2 guys have the same girl friend, and drugs use. The Libertarian believes he is helping the world with his drugs, and is on a mission to help the third world with the money he makes from the drug sales.

Savages is perhaps also his most straight-forward film to date, that has his usual tirade against the establishment conspicuously absent, boasting an ensemble cast of fresh faces and veterans centered around drug cartels, mergers and acquisitions, and a warped yet strong, love story as its emotional centre.Based upon the novel of the same name by Don Winslow, Savages aptly describes all the leading characters in this story, who are ruled by their primal instincts whether in their nature, or having the environment they're in forced unto them. The anti-heroes here are Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Johnson), two high school buddies whose bromance had led them to a path of joint riches, with Chon's tour of duty in Afghanistan resulted in his smuggling of A-grade cannabis seeds for cultivation, combined with Ben's botanical know how and business acumen. They become well known as the go to people for their boutique concoction to get high, and soon their reputation precedes them, with interest coming from Mexican cartels to want to acquire their business and transfer of knowledge. Which of course they get the big middle finger.So in true gangster fashion, you hit them where it hurts most, by kidnapping their joint squeeze O (Blake Lively), and blackmailing them for their cooperation and part of the business. But nobody will take this lying down, especially when one has power, money and the law on your side, crookedly of course, and the entire narrative shifts into turbo gear, gripping from that point on in a cat and mouse game played by three sides, Chon and Ben, the Mexicans led by Elena (Salma Hayek) and her main enforcer Lado (Benicio Del Toro), and a manipulative DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta), where trust becomes that scarce commodity, and everyone looking into preserving their interests when events escalate into full scale violence, and tit for tat retaliation.You'll be forced to believe and go along with the explicit menage a trois relationship between O, Chon and Ben, in what would be an extremely open relationship where the two men take turns to physically share O, as well as each other when it comes to the running of their business. This is somewhat important as it seals the deal, to make it somewhat believable that they would risk everything just to ensure her safety and return into their arms when she gets taken, setting into motion every act of violence that Chon is very capable of, and dragging the fairly violence reluctant Ben along for an eye for an eye action. If this aspect of the men's relationship, and that with O, fail to engage, then this story would fall apart because the narrative will be riddled with too many what ifs, since what Ben and Chon would do, would run contrary to logic.And in some strange coincidence, this was almost a three on three, with the younger cast members showing off what they can do, and the veterans holding their own and responding back, despite having more limited screen time, but nonetheless making full use of what's given to stem their mark. Taylor Kitsch turns in a steady performance after the rather bland outings as John Carter, and in Battleship. Although again cast as muscle in the film, he's made to look good thanks to Aaron Johnson sharing some pitch perfect chemistry as the blood brother, while Blake Lively had the rather surprising task of holding the entire story together, being the chief narrator from beginning to end.Not to be outdone, Salma Hayek, so rarely seen on screen these days, sizzle as the drug cartel queen whose black heart is obscured by her well maintained figure, vicious and cunning, though not without a weakness that you'd come to expect some exploitation later in the tale. John Travolta probably has the least screen time here as the corrupt cop, but one who's somewhat necessary if not to isolate the law in the film, since it would be highly unrealistic to do so. Equipped with a motor mouth and loyalties that swing as fast as the outcome of the drug war, his role as master manipulator against Benicio Del Toro's Lado was one of the many highlights in the film. If I were to judge which actor did and had the best role, it would be Del Toro hands down, as the Mexican enforcer who is none too bright, but compensating that for a brand of uncompromising violence, and a behaviour that disgusts.Full of scenes involving drug abuse, sex and plenty of gore filled violence that went for realism rather than designed to be over the top, Savages is one of a kind film about drug dealers involved in a mergers and acquisitions gone terribly wrong. It zips through its more than 2 hour narrative with wit and pomp, with breathtaking visuals and an eclectic choice of music scattered throughout. If only it did not flinch in it finale, and decided upon a single ending, rather than a choose your own adventure style that hinted at a cop out to please those who read about its level of blood. Still, this is an Oliver Stone film so why not an ending that's bound to create some controversy and buzz, and for fans of crime capers, this is a definite recommendation.",Savages
20,namashi_1,Another Winner by Stone!,10,18 December 2012,"Oliver Stone is amongst the bravest & most influential storytellers of Cinema. His magnificent body of work speaks in volumes & is sure to last a legacy. With 'Savages', Stone delivers a Yet Another Winner! Its twisted, gory, potty-mouthed & utterly delicious! 'Savages' Synopsis: Pot growers Ben and Chon face off against the Mexican drug cartel who kidnapped their shared girlfriend.'Savages' works big time because the Screenplay is so well-written, despite its paper-thin plot. Shane Salerno, Don Winslow & Stone's Adapted Screenplay is hard-core & undeniably arresting. Of course, it won't appeal to the faint-hearted, but, 'Savages' isn't even meant for them. Stone's Direction is masterful, as always. Cinematography is magnetic. Editing is fair. Art & Costume Design are proper. Performance-Wise: Benicio del Toro is mesmerizing. The Oscar-Winning Actor plays the monstrous villain with rare ease. Taylor Kitsch is decent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is first-rate. Blake Lively & Salma Hayek are excellent. John Travolta plays the sly cop, superbly. Emile Hirsch & The Marvellous Demián Bichir are admirable in cameos.On the whole, 'Savages' is a knockout!",Savages
21,blanbrn,Good crime thrilling drama that's blended with raw sex appeal and explosive cat and mouse action!,8,6 July 2012,"Oliver Stone is mostly known for making films that express social or political views, however here he scores big with the raw explosive crime drama ""Savages"". Stone shows the brutal life of the drug underworld as it's way of life is raw and brutal the dealings are cat and mouse. The film is interesting from the start the way it tells the story of each character as the drama and film's pace leads to explosive action. And good sex appeal is shown in the form of Blake Lively and Salma Hayek.Set in sunny southern California on a surf beach two friends Chon(Taylor Kitsch)and Ben(Aaron Johnson)live the party life just like cool dudes in the process their great amount of income is from growing and making marijuana and both share a bed and have causal sex with gal pal the exotic and free spirited beauty named O(Blake Lively). Then things change when the two decide to take up business with a deadly Mexican drug cartel.The film becomes a cat and mouse adventure once O is kidnapped it's now an underworld of internet communication and backstabbing business deals with info from informants and rats. John Travolta is in a good supporting role as a middle of the road funny DEA agent. And a pleasure to watch is the wicked and cold hearted witch sexy performance from sexy Salma Hayek as Mexican drug cartel leader Elena she puts boss Lado(Benicio Del Toro)to shame! If you can put up with the brutal scenes of violence and the kidnapping matches you will enjoy ""Savages"" as it's a raw sexy drama that exposes the drug underworld as Stone proves it's okay to go a little dark as it still brings viewing pleasure.",Savages
22,KineticSeoul,Well Benicio Del Toro at least stood out...,6,5 September 2012,"This is a decent effort to make a violent and controversial movie that doesn't go with all the Hollywood elements. But it does have flaws and after the next day after seeing this movie, it just doesn't seem like that good of a movie. It tries to be realistic but the direction and the character decisions and mentality doesn't make much sense sometimes. Maybe further explanation might have worked cause some parts just didn't make sense realistically. When it comes to the cast only 2 characters put on a good or even impressive performance. The rest who are like the main characters in this movie just didn't stand out and there just wasn't anything memorable about them. Hollywood is probably trying to make Taylor Kitsch the next big thing in movies or something, he wasn't awful in this but he wasn't memorable either. Well at least he wasn't as awful as Blake Lively, I am not sure if her character is suppose to be dumb to the point her reactions look so darn fake. But it just didn't work in this and her narration was crap but wasn't good either but yeah her acting was painfully annoying to watch. Aaron Johnson the guy from ""Kick-Ass"" is in this and there is nothing special about his character either. So this trio who are not the heroes but not the villains either are the ones that didn't add much to this movie. The two main dudes are pot head and pot sellers that make a ton of profit off what they do, one being the brains of the operation when it comes to supplying. The other is the muscle that is brash at getting the money from their clients. But when it comes to the villains such as Benicio Del Toro who plays a creepy and yet very intimidating and vile character that is ruthless and evil. I was sold with Del Toro's performance, such a not likable character and yet it upgraded this movie since there is some tension when he is on screen. Salma Hayek seemed to enjoy playing the queen of the drug cartel business and her performances is enjoyable to watch. John Travolta plays a crooked cop and he does that slightly crazy and obnoxious role that he does well. If you want to see a movie with very very terrible morals and values this might be for you. The ending in this just seemed more cheap than controversial. There is quite a bit of gritty violence in this though that sometimes come out when you least expect it. But for all the way through there is a high chance the audiences that view this won't give a crap what happens to any of the characters in this.6.3/10",Savages
23,Hellmant,'John Carter' and 'Kick-Ass' as buddy pot growers and Blake Lively is doing them both!,8,10 July 2012,"'SAVAGES': Four Stars (Out of Five) Oliver Stone returns to the dark and gritty, that he's best at, by directing this drug war crime drama. Adapted from the 2010 book of the same name, by Don Winslow, the film tells the story of two best friend pot growers, who also share a girlfriend, who do battle with a Mexican drug cartel in order to rescue their girlfriend, which the cartel kidnaps. The film features 'John Carter' (actor Taylor Kitsch) and 'Kick-Ass' (Aaron Johnson) as the buddies and Blake Lively is the babe doing them both! It co-stars Benicio Del Toro, Salma Hayek, John Travolta and Emile Hirsch. It was directed and co-written by Stone (along with Shane Salerno and Don Winslow himself). The movie is fast-paced and entertaining and is quite an improvement over Stone's recent slew of films (like 'WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS', 'WORLD TRADE CENTER' and 'ALEXANDER'). He did do 'W' in that bunch though, which was a good movie.Johnson plays Ben, the peace loving non violent brains behind a successful marijuana operation in Southern California. Kitsch plays his best friend Chon, an ex-Navy Seal who is the brawn behind the operation (although violence is almost never needed). Lively plays O (which is short for Ophelia), who's in love with both men who both love her back. They also love each other so much that they share her as a lover and a girlfriend. The boys' marijuana is well known as the best in the market, it's so well known for being that good that a Mexican drug cartel, ran by Elena Sanchez (Hayek) and her right hand man Lado (Del Toro), wants in on their business. Ben and Chon want nothing to do with the cartel and plan to flee the country. Elena suspects them of this and has their girlfriend kidnapped as a business incentive. She tells them she's going to keep her captive until they've been successful business partners for one year, which doesn't sit well with the boys. So the two turn to a corrupt DEA agent (Travolta) they've done business with in the past, for assistance in getting her back.The movie is extremely violent and Del Toro makes a great monstrous villain once again, stealing the show. Travolta kind of hams it up but isn't bad and Hayek is sexy but has been better. Blake Lively won't be getting any acting recognition for her part but she's as adorable as ever and Kitsch and Johnson make a likable leading man duo. There are some clever lines, some funny moments and for the most part the movie is pretty thrilling. The love story worked for me; in this day and age what's really so bad about two guys sharing the woman they both love, in my opinion (if they're happy who's to judge it). I enjoyed that angle of the film and I also like the main message of the story which shows why it's morally wrong (also in this day and age) for marijuana to still be illegal. We all know the enormous benefits of the drug and how harmless it really is and keeping it illegal only sends more and more people to prison (for victimless crimes) and to the morgue (as this film shows). Making marijuana usage a crime is one of the biggest crimes of all. The movie, like I said, is entertaining as well and has Stone back doing what he does best.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVtbIzK8ZjQ",Savages
24,thesar-2,Savagely Bad,1,28 December 2013,"Nothing or nobody could've prepared me for Savages. But, the incredibly inept opening narration should've been clue number one what I was in for.Director Oliver Stone was great at one point, right? Make that: many points of many films for decades. I am curious to find out if even he watched this finished project before it was distributed. How could he miss the multitudes of incompetence of this film? Even a first time director would've been embarrassed or caught even half of the dozen or so fails shown here.The number one problem overall was the wretched script and abominable dialogue in said script. Attempting to not laugh out loud or, at minimum, shake your head with each word spoken, specifically the unintentionally hilarious narration, was a fruitless act. Oh, and speaking of which, acting, particularly Blake Lively's O(h my god, she sucks) character, was second on the naughty list. Absolutely everyone else, including a terrible and phoned in John Travolta, was awful, but the ironically named Lively should've taken home the Razzie. Or hopefully, at very least, never act again.Further, the feeble attempts at cinematic style on screen failed hard with each scene and the laughable stock footage didn't help. In a movie about drugs and heavy usage almost proved Stone must've been high himself when this was shot. Also, the all-over-the-place and endless story was just too dumb to be even mocked. Like the inconceivable length of this movie, the randomness of events, subplots/relationships and pathetic twists felt too much and never once authentic.In a threesome of partners-in-crime have a dilemma when Mexican Madmen want to ""monitor"" their successful drug business for three years. As with the rest of the script, the boys (oh, sorry, the threesome is two dudes and one girl, but supposedly the two buds aren't gay) go back and forth on deciding on whether to join the Mexican Mafia. So, while they boringly debate, they decide to add a lot of screen time to the movie's length by: going to dinner, hanging out in their pad, drinking, smoking and attempting to launder money – but even that, they keep flip-flopping with a wasted use of the talented Emile Hirsch.To make matters worse, (meaning: unfortunately the film went on) the Mexican Meanies kidnap the female portion of their pact and the boys would do anything to get her back. Unconvincingly, but still. So, they do this, do that, change this, trick thatnothing with continuity, originality or believability.And the predictable climax actually borrows fromthe Twilight film series conclusion? Now, that's rich and so appropriate for this movie that inconceivably took three writers to script. Including Stone.Though completely unintentional, Savages might actually be more hilarious than my previous favorite pot-comedy: Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. But since it's ""supposed to be serious,"" the movie's over the top gore, violence and language felt more like ""Look at what I can do!"" than meshing with the actual scenes. The kicker was that the sex scenes looked incredibly awkward and not even believable had it been a teen's first time.Obviously, this is a skip. Save your two-and-a-half hours for your loved ones because if you're headed to hell in the afterlife, why start your torture here?* * * Final thoughts: Showing more male ass than female nudity helps in any movie, but sadly, in the case of Savages, when you start with the two lead's bums upfront, it can only go down from there. And, it did feel like an avalanche of dread from when their respectably nice butts were so nicely displayed to the end credits.",Savages
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A seasoned director delivers an engrossing, trendy ride",9,3 June 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBen (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is a hard-ass ex soldier, who runs a drug running business with his more spiritual, enlightened younger brother Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and their shared lover Ophelia (Blake Liveley.) They find themselves pressured in to forming an alliance with a vicious Mexican cartel, headed by Elena (Salma Hayek), and when they refuse, Ophelia is kidnapped, plunging them in to a deadly, blood thirsty game.Many have become of the persuasion that the war on drugs is failing and legalisation is the only realistic way forward, but if that were the case, the set up for many a drug themed action/thriller type film such as this would be gone and the formula would have no further route to peddle it's tried and tested, but still effective and entertaining wares. Savages isn't trying to come at you from any angle, or present any hard social reality about the narcotics world, such as Traffic. It's just an effective, engrossing tale set in that world.Back in the day, the name Oliver Stone was almost a prerequisite for something sure to raise eye brows and have at least some degree of controversy to it, but the biggest worry these days is that he's an older, more mature director maybe too stuck in his ways, but he has at his helm a young, vibrant cast, in a film shot in a trendier, flashier style suited to a modern audience. But he never lets it become a case of style over substance, taking his time and crafting a genuinely tense, absorbing thriller with elements of dark comedy and pathos. The young cast do an impressive job of carrying the film, with helpful support from more veteran performers, including Hayek, Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta as a crooked drug enforcement agent playing both sides off against each other.Stone appears, aesthetically, to be taking a mellowing with age approach to this offering, simply an old raconteur telling a bloody, vicious but simple story about the casualties of drug wars. There doesn't seem to be any subtle social commentary or political tub thumping like in his more ancient efforts, but in a time where he may be getting phased out to make way for young blood, he proves he can still craft a slick, stylish and thoroughly engrossing thriller that doesn't feel a drag at over two hours. ****",Savages
26,ElMaruecan82,"So far, THE gangster film of the 2010's ...",9,31 December 2012,"""Just because I'm telling this story doesn't mean I'm alive at the end"", this is Ophelia aka 'O' narrating. The opening line resonates with the same intriguing intensity than Henry Hill's ""I've always wanted to be a gangster"", warning us at the same time not to try to outsmart what seems to be a formulaic plot, it might outsmart us as well, which it ultimately does, to our greatest delight. 'O' is a young, tall and beautiful blonde whose sensual body, much more her heart, belongs to two men: Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch). From her laconic, almost soulless delivery, we perceive the effects of an emotionally devastating and (maybe) deadly journey. We understand that ""the kind of story"" she refers to is something quite unusual starting with that peculiar threesome.Chon is a former Navy SEAL who smuggled the seeds of cannabis from its best (and most dangerous) source ever: Afghanistan, Ben is a Berkeley graduate and an accomplished botanist. Together, they grew the best marijuana in the world, earning them a fast ascension and a large customer base. I mentioned ""Goodfellas"", but the film owes a lot to other semi- documentary crime biopics such as ""Casino"" or ""City of God"" and even to ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" in a less humorous way. ""Savages"" opens with a success story that can be extrapolated to any business, the key being the complementarity between Ben and Chon, doer and thinker, and quality: the THC ratio of 33% against 3 or 5 from the competitors, was the best guarantee for success.And naturally, their lifestyle is the perfect American Dream's reflection: money, a house in a postcard paradise, and the seemingly trophy girl 'O' who loves both, not as two separate guys but as one person, Chon is the body, and Ben the spirit. It's implied later that Ben and Chon only accept to share her because they also love each other. But rather than unveiling the eventuality of a conflict, it confirms the solidity of the triangular love; they're all part of a same couple. It might sound too idealistic, romantic, or pervert, but it's crucial to the plot, because when 'O' is kidnapped, it justifies Ben and Chon's efforts to save her, she's the seal of their friendship, they certainly would have abandoned her to save their assess, if she was a trophy girl.Blake Lively delivers a fine performance as 'O', a beautiful yet vulnerable flower that can only bloom under this shining love. We quickly forget about the sex scenes, the superficial shopping and start looking at her with more concerned eyes. I was more puzzled by the casting of the two male leads, but it might be the film's strike of genius. These unknown and fresh-looking faces, not only highlight Oliver Stone's defiance from the usual all-star cast trends (no Jason Statham as Chon or Ryan Gosling as Ben), but they underline the third key of their success: secrecy, they're the guys who avoid any kind of trouble. Chon uses his military skills every once in a while to discourage the cheaters, and Ben uses his head to provide the services of an expert to do all the money-laundry. Ben and Chon are like two crime-geeks who learned all the tricks from movies and the anonymity of their faces makes the supporting cast even more efficient. As soon as we see Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro, Demian Bashir and John Travolta entering the screen, we know troubles have begun and our rookies will make their bones by confronting more 'usual' faces. Indeed, one thing they didn't see coming is that the competitive advantage of their start-up would become its main threat. When you grow the best pot in the world, you're likely to attract the most powerful cartel from Mexico, lead by a drug Queen Elena Sanchez, Salma Hayek in a femme fatale role (almost Oscar- worthy considering how distant she is from her habitual characters). And Del Toro, as always, doesn't need much to electrify the screen, he was born to play psychopathic characters, providing the perfect dose of humor the movie needed to compensate the romantic undertones. Ben and Chon receive a video link by e-mail from the Cartel: Del Toro decapitates a former gang that refused to cooperate, a serious warning: these guys mean business. The two 'gringos' are given a fair offer from Alex, Bashir as one of Elena's lieutenants, and just like in ""The Godfather"", it's a 'no' that opens the Pandora box and push the Cartel to kidnap 'O' and blackmail her lovers. This is where the film really takes off and becomes an exhilarating thriller involving Ben, Chon, the Cartel and the obligatory corrupt DEA played by a scene-stealing John Travolta.""Savages"" turn into a thrilling chess game between criminals, trying to have the upper hand on the negotiations and find the enemy's weakest spot. Hayek who spied on Ben and Chon, understood that she would 'pull the strings' if she got 'O', but her tactic could become a double-edged sword as something precious could be used to blackmail her as well, 'something' that might explain why she's being so motherly toward 'O'. To a certain point, the film turns into a sort of Guy Ritchie plot where it's all about who's going to anticipate the enemy's move and win the duel, inviting the seemingly clean protagonists to question their own morality. See, I mentioned many gangster films in this review, because Oliver Stone borrows the best ingredients of the genre yet never recycle clichéd situations, he avoids such tricks as bloody shootouts or worse, a climactic Mexican stand-off.""Savages"" remains original and entertaining from the mysterious beginning to its mind- blowing ending, and more than any other film, it's deeply rooted in our era with all its use of technology: Skype calls, clips, hacking, Internet. ""Savages"" might be THE gangster film of the 2010's.",Savages
27,bowmanblue,Who is this Oliver Stone?,6,23 March 2015,"I know of acclaimed director, Oliver Stone, who released one stylish, deep-thinking, gritty classic film after another. Now, we find that someone else has only gone and stolen his name and is releasing films, pretending to be him... oh, wait, my mistake - it IS Oliver Stone.Perhaps, Oliver Stone has suffered a nasty knock to the head recently and been duped into taking on this film when he wasn't thinking straight? Or maybe he was kidnapped by aliens and replaced with an identical clone who makes this sort of movie. Either way, it's hard to believe that the man who made Platoon, JFK and Natural Born Killers would stoop so low. Actually, that's unfair. If you're into gangster-type films and you just so happened to watch this, you may think it wasn't that bad. Nothing brilliant, but certainly not rubbish. And you'd be right. However, it's an OLIVER STONE film, therefore with that sort of quality name attached to it, you just expect much more.It's about a trio of drug dealers (two men and one woman), all of which are 'in love.' Then, one day their threesomes are interrupted by a nasty ol' Mexican cartel demanding they take over their business. Then, to make matters worse, the Cartel Cliché only go and kidnap the two guys' girl, leaving them with no one for their ménage a trois. Therefore, they have to go on a rampage to get her back.Now, this set-up leaves us with some awkward questions. First of all the three 'heroes' are all drug dealers. They live a carefree and lavish lifestyle and it's hard to give a damn whether they get completely wiped out by the Mexicans or not. Secondly, the girl (or Blake Lively) is possibly the most annoying on-screen character this side of Jar Jar Binks. The whole first half hour of the film is taken up with her voice-over, making her come across as a voice in your head which just won't go away. Then, even when she does get kidnapped, she starts complaining about the accommodation and food the drug dealers are offering. Seriously... if I was those two guys I would have placed an add for a new threesome partner online and left her to the Mexicans a long time ago!Plus the film is long. It tries to be epic, but it does drag in places. Then you have John Travolta, popping up occasionally to majorly overact. To counter this you have the - normally excellent - Benicio Del Toro coming across as if he's half asleep.Don't get me wrong, the film isn't bad. There are a few cool scenes to make you sit up and take notice, but the whole package just seems a bit underdeveloped and not worthy of Oliver Stone's name.If you really like gangster/drug deal films, then give it a go - you might like it. But, a lot of criticism has been poured on its ending. I won't give anything away, but I'll certainly say it's novel. You'll either love it or hate it.",Savages

A Mexican Cartel, run by Elena, wants to partner with them. They are planning to leave the country and not take the deal, but the cartel kidnaps their shared girl, O. Lado is the guy that heads the cartel's dirty business. Heads get cut, guys burned alive, torture, etc... He was a great character. Elana wants to keep O for a year, so the guys decide to get money to pay her off to get O back. The way they get this money was very clever and there is a DEA agent playing both sides. Elena was great because she is this evil woman, but acts so motherly and concerned most of the time.

Both Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson are really good in the leads and you end up being able to feel their pain. Blake Lively, John Travolta, Salma Hayek, and Benicio Del Toro all have very good supporting roles here.Overall, this is a very good, high-paced film.

Mistake!The only thing I loved about it was Salma Hayek's portrayal, the roll- back screenplay at the end and the cover version of The Beatles' ""Here Comes The Sun!""Bottom line is if you miss this, you can die peacefully after realizing that the sex scenes had the 'clothes on'!For more: bit.ly/TEJAS",Savages

34,tomgillespie2002,An unpleasant yet exciting two hours,5,1 January 2013,"Two childhood friends, Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) run a highly profitable business in Laguna Beach, California, where they share everything including their girlfriend O (Blake Lively). Chon, an ex-Navy SEAL, is the muscle, and Ben, a highly skilled botanist, is the brains. After a few years of hard work, they now grow and sell the most powerful strain of marijuana in the world. When they are sent a video depicting a mass chain-saw murder by Lado (Benicio Del Toro), they move to meet a powerful Mexican cartel ran by honcho Elena (Salma Hayek). Against the advice of CIA insider Dennis (John Travolta), Chon and Ben refuse the cartel an offer of partnership and plan to flee to Indonesia the next day. Unimpressed by the insult, Lado and his crew abduct O, forcing them into a three-year business deal, but Chon and Ben have other ideas.Treading relatively unfamiliar ground, Oliver Stone's latest film is most akin to his sleazy 1997 neo-noir U-Turn, employing cinematographer Dan Mindel to create a violent yet sun-bleached world of torture, corruption, and sleazy Mexicans. The film begins with a group of masked unknowns being decapitated with a chain-saw, captured on shaky hand-held footage, and the film doesn't let up. The hulking Lado represents the physical side of the drugs business, and we later see him murder a lawyer and his wife in cold blood. But where the film is most impressive is when dealing with the tactical side of the situation, with Chon and Ben refusing to back down, and employing their own means of negotiation while Elena continues her wave of intimidation. It is these twists and turns that keep the film interesting, and while I found myself not really caring who gets out of it alive, the execution kept me on my toes.The ensemble of unrelatable and despicable characters is the main weakness of the film, with none of the large cast standing out as the focal point of the movie. Chon is suitably stoic as the much-needed physical presence in Chon and Ben's business, but it is Ben who provides the only remotely sympathetic character, a naive botany genius that is as horrified at the violence that unfolds before him as we are. The narration is provided by O, who after explaining her romantic situation with Chon and Ben admits that we are probably thinking ""slut!"", and she's right. Why would I care about a beautiful spoilt rich-girl living off the riches of two criminals? The performances are outstanding throughout, however. Del Toro proves genuinely terrifying straight from the off as we witness just what his character is capable of, but, surprisingly, it is Travolta's slimy CIA agent that impresses most. His panicked actions provide some amusement, and the scene with his dying wife is genuinely moving. Savages is not particularly original, intelligent or innovative, but it is two hours of exciting, if often unpleasant, entertainment.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Savages
35,Thanos_Alfie,Average...,5,31 July 2020,"""Savages"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch two best friends getting into some very serious troubles with the Mexican drug cartel. Things getting more serious when the cartel kidnaps their shared girlfriend.Since I had already watched the trailer and observed the cast I had high expectations from this movie and unfortunately I was disappointed by it. I was expecting something different and I believe that it became very boring at some points and also predictable in the end. For a movie with this budget and this cast, the result it was not bad but just above average. Finally, I have to say that ""Savages"" is another average action movie that starts very good but does not keep its good pace for more than an hour. If you want to watch an action movie I am sure that you will find more movies and far better than this one to watch.",Savages
36,Floated2,Intriguing Oliver Stone Drama,7,8 October 2013,"Having seen Savages today, I had no expectations going into the film as I was not aware much of the film and its plot. I also did not know it was based on a novel and having not reading the novel, my thoughts were more precise than those who have read the book. Therefore I was not able to compare the film with the book. My thoughts on Savages is that it is a gritty Spring Break atmosphere type drama. The film sets its tone right from the first scene than you see where it goes. I like the story behind the film, I thought it was an interesting take on an important and familiar topic of drug lords and how to deal with and be in partnership with others for the love of making money.Savages works for me because the plot was intriguing enough and I was always wondering where the film was heading. Noting the film is over 2 hours 20 minutes but feels much shorter. A lot of brutal torture violence is included with typical Oliver Stone type gun shots to the head, shootouts and gang violence relative scenes. I can see why people would be let down in the film simply because it is based from a novel and many times you compare the two and the films don't always fit everything from the novel. Not reading the novel, this was no problem for me. Also because it was an Oliver Stone film. The ending of Savages definitely made me take note on it, and it was obvious as to why they did this. I think it really could have had a better ending which is why I can't give this film a higher ratingLike many, I somewhat agree that Blake Lively was slightly miscast. She was there for eye candy and was solid for some of the film but overall she did not seem great enough to carry and Oliver Stone drama. The constant narrative throughout the film got tiresome and I felt was not needed. Thought Taylor Kitsh did a decent job as his role, though felt he was bland at times. I liked Aaron Johnson's character and the way he took his role. Easily the stand out of the three leads. Benicio Del Toro does great as the king drug lord, as does Salma Hayek in her role. John Trovolta however clearly phones in his performance as the overreacting cop. All in all Savages does the job.
===
As a rewatch (06/30/18') Savages remains a very solid and interesting drama. As noted, the film has a slow buildup within its firs hour with setting up its central plot, then towards the second half of the film, it settles in and becomes furthermore intriguing and engaging. Overall, Savages may be quite underrated though could have also been quite better.",Savages
37,johnnyboyz,"Terse and often quite involving, but this is fairly hollow stuff in the long run.",6,30 December 2015,"""Savages"" has very little that is profound to say about both drugs and the narcotics trade, save that they can land you in a lot of trouble and that its universes are inhabited by some very dangerous people. The film is fast, loose and kinetic; its runtime clocks in at over two hours, despite not feeling like it. It is extraordinarily visceral and wallows in postmodernism to the extent that cathartic events towards the end are quite literally rewound by the narrator so as to depict them in a different way. It is also somewhat of a generic film – at one point, a character utters a ridiculously clichéd line along the lines of ""smoke that...."", before dropping an f-bomb and making an impossible shot with a scoped rifle unrealistic to the circumstances.Quite, this is not for the crowd that enjoyed ""Traffic"" – its multi-stranded nature; insistence on dipping in and out of a varied glut of characters' fates and very airy, almost dreamlike aesthetic, as the camera waves in and out of compositions and has fun with focus and depth of field to put across a sense of feeling to the audience, is about all it has in common with said film.""Savages"" is told from the perspective of Blake Lively's Ofelia, whose name is abridged to merely ""O"" and who spends most of the time away from the very people whose actions she is telling us about and the places within which these things happen. She lives in Laguna Beach, California, with Chon (Kitsch) and Ben (Taylor-Johnson) – two young-ish men who are to the local marijuana trade what Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were to computers and microchips. We are told Shaun fought in the Middle East, and buries his scars with weed and blunt sexual intercourse with O, but this is not revisited. Both he and his dreadlocked accomplice, we sense, are too young to be competent enough to be running the operation (which extends as far as Africa and South East Asia) they do. They unrealistically possess access to a ""Bourne""-like command centre; maintain an uneasy relationship with John Travolta's DEA agent and have an endless supply of cannabis.O's background sees her, like so many people who get into marijuana, come from a family made broken by the lack of a father figure – something which saw her tumble out into the Californian counter culture and into a universe of hedonism and self-gratification. The abruptness of her name derives from a hatred of high-culture; reading and intellect, something synonymous with her type, in that it derives from a William Shakespeare text, and that cannot be tolerated... At one point, Shaun perfectly sums up the three's philosophy when he reminds Ben: ""You were dead the second you were born."" ""Welcome to paradise"" O tells us as things open, but we then witness the threesome proceed to dull their brains and numb their senses through smoking in order to pass the time - in spite of living under the roaring sun; on a fabulous beach and with more than enough recreation in the form of cycling; surfing and otherwise to fill their hours. We have all frequented places that offer these things, at least once in our lifetimes, either in the capacity of holiday makers or otherwise – at no point, as we occupied these places of such beauty, did it occur to us that stupefying our minds with illicit substances might be rather a good idea.The trio are so good at what they do, although we are unsure as to O's actual purpose, that they attract the attention of a bigger, broader Mexican cartel based just south of the border going through its own fiscal problems. Offering to move in and thus soak up some of the action, the gang, run by Selma Hayek, are aghast when Ben and Shaun say ""no"" – something which kicks off the kidnapping of O and forces the two supporting males into a spiral of blood; guts; guns and grief. But much of this has the film sound as if it is better than it is.For what it is, ""Savages"" is bouncy and energetic, and it involves us enough to want to observe as to where things venture. Oliver Stone, a versatile and often very impressive director, has essentially made the Mexico-United States border narcotics thriller for this generation: the Skype calls; the keyboard warfare and the sub-Call of Duty sniper fights. The characters are young and hip – the expert on the hacking and computer data side of things even looks as if he fell out of an episode of ""The O.C."" When the time comes to see two stalwarts such as Travolta and del Toro share the screen, in what is a fairly intense dialogue-driven sequence, it feels as if Stone is pausing in order to provide those who can remember a little further back with a moment for themselves.And so we come away from the film unable to either love or hate it – it would not be a misstep to recommend it, but to place it against some of Stone's other work and other films on the subject matter would be a mistake. Where ""Savages"" ends up, that is to say what propels its final act in the form of a counter-kidnap, might very well have occurred at the hour mark is the best exemplar of its structural problems. Films big in both scope and scale of the contemporary crime thriller sort, as two sides appear to constantly rub one another the wrong way, often have the potential to be truly memorable: ""Heat"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" taught us that. ""Savages"" is not one of these instances, but that is not to say it is of no worth.",Savages
38,BeneCumb,"Not bad, but considering the director's reputation - mediocre",7,9 November 2012,"The weakest element of the movie is its screenplay which is hectic: sometimes too slow, but then the events proceed too fast and you start pondering who, why and what... Especially as main characters travel between Mexico and the United States. The ending is awkward and with a twist, but I had the blah feeling somehow.Another peculiarity is that 3 supporting actors Benicio del Toro, Selma Hayek and John Travolta outperform all the main stars Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson and Blake Lively. Del Toro is definitely the best performer and his part as cartel enforcer Lado is a vicious, but versatile and observable character.Well, it is probably one of the weakest Oliver Stone's movies, but it is still watchable. Calling it ""boring"" or ""flop"" is an exaggeration.",Savages
39,dfranzen70,"Kind of snoozy, but looks good",7,22 July 2014,"Two rich dope dealers run afoul of a Mexican cartel that wants to take over their business, and things really get kicked up a notch when the cartel kidnapped the dealers' shared girlfriend. Savages offers an exciting premise and some excellent action, but it's too often listlessly and unconvincingly acted to really hold one's attention.Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) have seen their little pot farm grown into a very lucrative business. Their not-a-third-wheel partner, O (Blake Lively) is a free spirit surfer girl who loves both of them, because that sort of thing happens in real life. And then one day the cartel from south of the border decided to horn in on their business, which exploits a particularly intense strain of the plant.Representing the cartel, Lado (Benicio del Toro) and Esteban (Diego Catano) approach the, uh, mom-and-pop business with a proposal - join us, we get most of the profits, you get to live long and prosper, and so on. The boys are split about whether this is a good idea, as ex-soldier Chon wants to take the fight to the Mexicans and bookish Ben wants to maximize profits and minimize blood. While they dither on the offer, though, O is kidnapped by the cartel's head honcho, Elena (Salma Hayek).This isn't some A-Team-style action movies in which the good guys, a ragtag band of dudes with a lot of moxie and heart, take on an evil corporation of thugs. But it's close. What follows isn't really a precise plan or even a grunting, against-all-odds attack but rather a whimpering, half-assed rescue attempt that probably succeeds, if we're being honest - even though O herself says in the first scene (in voice over) that she may very well be dead.Taylor-Johnson, who's grown up a tad since Kick-Ass, and Kitch are both pretty good, with neither playing a caricature more than a character. Lively's O, although pretty and vivacious and such, seems half asleep by comparison.",Savages
40,meeza,"Was not stoned enough to like this one, but it was not a total downer",6,5 August 2012,"Let's just say that I was not a savage lover as I watching Director Oliver Stone's latest movie ""Savages"". Stone this time around focuses on those who help people get stoned, the drug cartels and the hemp farmers. The movie stars Blake Lively as O, an early 20's California blonde who has been addicted to drugs since she was in the 8th Grade, that pretty much sums up the ""Story of O""; if you got that last analogy you are an official early 70's porn aficionado. OK, moving right along. O shares her time and her body with two men who like to hemp and hump O; that would be the former Navy Seal bravado Chon and the scientific hemp intellect (is there such a thing?) Ben. Ben and Chon do give Cheech & Chong a run for their money on how much hemp they have fabricated and inhaled. They are protected by corrupt DEA Agent Dennis, who is a menace to drug prevention society himself. A Mexican drug cartel ran by the callous Elena (Salma Hayek) wants to buy out Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Factory, I mean Ben & Chong's Hemp Factory. When Ben & Chong don't oblige, Elena decides to take matters and O into her own hands by having her kidnapped. The rest of ""Savages"" plays out like a mediocre take on the drug wars which we have seen before way too many times in motion pictures. Stone does not provide us anything into the picture that we have not inhaled before as cinematic viewers; please don't take that the wrong way, like Clinton I did not inhale even though I would not mind having sexual relationships with that Lively woman. Shane Salerno and Dan Winslow's screenplay was filled more with lows than highs with its cliché injected verbose. Lively was competent in her performance as O, but I could not say the same for the lame efforts of her bed & weed breakfast buddies Aaron Johnson as Ben and Taylor Kitsch as Chon. John Travolta massaged (pardon the rub I mean pun) the part of Dennis with typical Travoltaism; worthy but typical of Mr. Saturday Night Fever. Oscar-nominated actor Demian Bichir was underutilized as Elena's lawyer Alex, and some underutilization was also thespianly incorporated in the work of Emile Hirsch as Spin, a tech wizard pal of Ben & Chong's. The performance I was most high about was that of Benicio Del Toro portraying Lado, Elena's intimidating right-hand man who really desires not to be en el lado de Elena. ""Savages"" does have some nice cinematography. But in the end, to quote Huey Lewis & The News, ""I want a new drug"" movie that really depicts the savage effects of drugs instead of romanticizing it. So yea, I was not too high on ""Savages"". *** Average",Savages
41,MBunge,"Takes way, way, WAAAAAAAAAY too long to get going",4,21 July 2014,"I would guess there are a lot of people out there who don't appreciate what a big deal Oliver Stone used to be in cinema. And no, Stone fans, the guy hasn't been a big deal in any respect for a while now. Well, if people could watch the last half of Savages, they might gain some understanding of why Stone's work was once so highly anticipated and much discussed. Unfortunately, that kind of requires you to watch the first half of Savages, which is the sort of overwrought and uninspired filmmaking which is simultaneously so boring and exhausting that sitting through it is more like an endurance test than entertainment. There is not one single moment, performance, passage of dialog, plot twist or visual trick in the first half of Savages that has originality, surprise, uniqueness, insight or any emotional appeal.To start with, this film may have the laziest narration I've ever heard in any motion picture I've ever seen. And I don't mean lazy like the half assed job Harrison Ford did with Blade Runner. I mean lazy in that Stone uses it to repeatedly inform the audience about the story they're watching instead of showing it. Not to mention that it includes plenty of eye-rolling phrases like a woman describing a troubled Afghanistan War vet with the line ""I have orgasms. He has wargasms"". Yeesh.This tale is about a couple of California pot growers named Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch). Yes. His name is Chon, something I'd bet 98% of viewers don't realize unless they sit through the end credits. I don't mind unusual or distinctive character names but Chon? Was the hospital out of J's the day he was born?Anyway, Ben and Chon have become quite successful selling their own brand of highly potent marijuana. It's given them a big house and a polyamorous relationship with O (Blake Lively), a poor little girl neglected by her rich mother and multitude of stepfathers. Then a Mexican drug cartel insists or forging a partnership with Ben and Chon and kidnaps O when the boys are reluctant to agree. Our dynamic and quite chronic duo then kidnap the somewhat estranged daughter of the cartel's distaff leader (Salma Hayek) and demand the return of O and the end of the cartel's harassment. There's also a stretch where Ben and Chon attack a cartel drug shipment to get money to pay for O's return and then frame a cartel lawyer as a spy, but none of it matters or makes much sense as anything but an excuse for Stone to try and recapture the visceral and visual thrills that once distinguished his movies. He fails.None of the preceding stuff in Savages has a whit of heart, charm, style or brains. A bit more than halfway through the flick, though, Stone largely abandons Ben and John to focus on Lado (Benicio Del Toro), a cartel enforcer who's playing every angle on both sides of the law and the border; Dennis (John Travolta), a DEA agent who is delightfully straightforward in his corruption; and Elana's turn toward O as a substitute for her own daughter. Scenes where Lado confronts Dennis about his treachery and where Elana's motherly instinct toward O exists in perfect harmony with her criminal ruthlessness are just marvelous in their style, substance and timing. In a few moments, Travolta will remind you of how truly gifted he is and how he's squandered almost as much of his acting life as Nicholas Cage. Travolta is even able to overcome a scene where Dennis laments to his dying wife about how the world is full of crap and everyone is on the take, the sort of speechifying Stone no longer has the deft touch to pull off as a filmmaker.Too much of this sounds and feels like Oliver Stone's version of Miami Vice, the TV show and not the Michael Mann film. And not the good episodes of the early years but the stuff from late in its run when some blend of inertia and instant nostalgia was the only thing keeping it on the air. Stone has nothing to say here about drugs, addiction, legalization, relationships, violence, assimilation or any of the other themes the screenplay touches on and then forgets. This is a movie about nothing more than the fact that Oliver Stone still has enough juice to get a movie made in Hollywood. I suppose that's more than most folks can claim at any age or stage of their career. It's a lot less than we used to be able to expect from Stone.If Savages encourages anyone to check out Stone's earlier and much more ambitious work, I'm happy for that. I don't think that's enough to justify this film's existence.",Savages
42,estebangonzalez10,Old School Oliver Stone,8,30 September 2012,"¨It started here in paradise, Laguna Beach, where they say God parked himself on the seventh day, but they towed him on the eighth.¨ When the movie began I thought I was actually watching a trailer for another Hostel movie or something like that, but once I realized that it was actually the opening of Oliver Stone's new film I knew I was going to be in for something different. I knew the film would be much darker than his latest efforts going back to his Natural Born Killers days and I was excited about it. Then I heard Blake Lively's voice over narration and it kind of killed the momentum. Despite the fact that there was no need for the narration and some other minor issues, I really enjoyed this film for the most part. I don't think I was so hooked with a thriller like this one all year. I was literally at the edge of my seat once the boring setup was over with. The two biggest issues I had with this film had to do with the beginning and the ending, but for most of Savages I was really entertained and hooked. There are some great performances here as well, although they had to do more with the secondary characters than the main ones. Savages could have been one of my favorite films of the year if it weren't for those issues I had. The film is really violent and difficult to watch at times, but if you like these kinds of thrillers then you will enjoy this movie. Oliver Stone made a name for himself way back in 1979 when he won an Oscar for the adaptation of Midnight Express, and followed such success by directing films like Platoon, Nixon, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, and Any Given Sunday. He's done very diverse projects, but Savages is perhaps one of his most violent and darkest films to date, at least from this century. It will stick with you long after the movie is over.Ophelia (Blake Lively), -who actually calls herself O after realizing she was named after the suicidal character from Hamlet- lives an ideal life in Laguna Beach along with her two lovers, Chon (Taylor Kitsch) a former Navy SEAL, and Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) a bright marihuana producer and entrepreneur. Ben and Chon have been best friends since High School and have no problem sharing their love with O. The two friends are very different from each other; Ben is peaceful while Chon who has been affected by war in Iraq is more of a violent person. The two have had success with their marihuana business since the weed that they produce is one of the best in the world. They run things as peacefully as possible, but when a Mexican drug cartel wants to become partners with them, things begin to get out of hand. The cartel is run by la Reina Elena (Salma Hayek), and Lado (Benicio del Toro) is in charge of doing the dirty work. When Elena tries to force the two men to associate with her through Alex (Demian Bichir) and they refuse, she sends O to be kidnapped. Ben and Chon will do whatever it takes to get the love of their lives back, while fighting off this dangerous cartel. A dirty FBI agent named Dennis (John Travolta) assists the Californian duo by providing some key information of the cartel. This is where things begin to get ugly and the violence escalates.Taylor Kitsch has had a very busy year with John Carter coming out earlier this year and then Battleship. I don't think he's a very good actor, but this is perhaps his better work. I really didn't know who Aaron Taylor-Johnson was until I heard he was the guy from Kick-Ass. He is unrecognizable in this film, and of the three leading actors, he's by far the best. I thought he gave a strong performance here, although in my opinion the best performances come from the secondary actors. Salma Hayek and John Travolta were great and remind us once again why they have been such successful actors over the years. My favorite performance came from Benicio del Toro who I thought was brilliant and one of the best villains of the year. The story is really gripping and intense; if it weren't for the narration or the pretty loose ending than this would've been a perfect movie. It's still worth your time and you won't regret Savages if you enjoy suspenseful thrillers and don't mind a little bit of violence. It's not a perfect movie, but I recommend it for the suspense and tension that Stone creates in this noir pulpy film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Savages

Ben is a botanist and MBA, Chon an army guy who brought back the best marihuana seeds from Afghanistan. They become hugely successful. Ben likes to conduct the business in peace, but when not possible, Chon steps in. Both are involved in a love triangle with O. All this happens on the mean streets of...Laguna Beach.One day they get a video of Mexican chainsaw beheadings and and invitation to a meeting. They attend and are told that a powerful Mexican cartel is going to take them over basically because they need their expertise. The guys have 24 hours to think about it and are naive enough to think they can negotiate with the cartel. Chon, ever the angry guy insults the big boss.The big boss, Elena, not used to being challenged is offended by their behavior and decides to force their hand by kidnapping O. Ben and Chon have a corrupt DEA agent on their payroll who tells them that they can't say no to a cartel. The cartel is like Walmart, and you don't try to compete with Walmart. He also tells them that the cartel faces some serious competition from another cartel and also has to deal with the issue of legalization in the US.We learn more about Elena. She inherited the business once her husband was killed. Her two sons are also dead and she has a daughter living the good life in California who doesn't want anything to do with her. Elena lives a very lonely life watching TV. The kidnapped O ends up befriending her, playing the role of her daughter of sorts. Elena decides to travel in secret to California to meet her daughter and she bring O along.Ben and Chon decide they won't make it easy on Elena.

But her right hand man, Lado, isn't convinced by the whole charade, he wants to go after the guys. When they discover that Elena has a daughter in the US, they take a page from Elena's playbook and kidnap the girl to exchange her for O.Savages is he most intellectually stimulating Hollywood movie I've seen in years. The script is quite brilliant. While casting is a bit odd, acting is strong overall. Travolta doesn't really look or sound the part and while the role of the not-so-bright blonde is well suited for Lively, she herself has something that just isn't likable. Odd is also the casting of Del Toro as a vicious Chicano enforcer, but as expected he nails it and shines in the role- despite the weird haircut. Because you do care about the story and the characters you end up looking for all the flaws you can find in this movie. Starting with the unlikely completely drama-free love triangle among young people. I understand it was necessary so that both Ben and Chon put all their energy on this mission to rescue O, at the same time this could have been solved more easily by making her the ex of both or the sister of one of them or something like that. It was also necessary so that O can say some truthful things about human nature. She needs Ben to fulfill her romantic needs and Chon to fulfill her more animalistic needs. Ben is one of those dopeheads who's a fan of Eastern thought, peace, and Buddha, he's idealistic and does philanthropic work in Indonesia. Chon doesn't look like a dope-head but is all action and violence. It' not clear why these two would be such close friends.The other issue is the whole idea of a violent drug cartel that specializes in...weed. As far as I know, it's the business of hard drugs that fuels violence in Mexico, not weed. Otherwise, things are portrayed fairly realistically.On to the good aspects of Savages. The word ""savages"" comes up in the movie in the three different contexts. The first when it is used by Americans against chainsaw-wielding violent Mexicans. Not much more needs to be said. The second time it's used by Mexicans to refer to rich Americans and their sex lives. Lado and Elena are trying to figure out just who O is involved with and can't conceive that she's with both of them. Also a mystery to the Mexicans is how Americans don't have a concept of normal family life. I use ""normal"" on purpose because it unnerves the relativistic liberal/academic crowd that argues that all lifestyles are equally good. O doesn't know her dad, her mom has been married/divorced multiple times and lives by herself in a giant mansion. A perfect symbol- the giant mansion impeccable on the outside, messy on the inside, and empty. Despite ideal conditions- huge wealth, Americans can't make it work. Elena is amazed by O's empty head. O lives by Americans' favorite and perhaps only guiding principle- seize the day. She wonders if O has ever given serious thought about her own future, about the day after today. ""Savages"" is used a third time near the end to refer to some idealistic and plain life in paradise. And so the script has smart and thoughtful things to say about all these topics and presents a rich story and a couple of surprises. Just because it makes you think plenty, I'm willing to forgive all the flaws- major and minor ones. On the surface it appears to be just another Scorsese-type rise-and-fall of likable bad guys movie, but this one backs up this ordinary idea with a very astute script.",Savages

It is almost a given he will some seasoned performers or will introduce us to performers who will eventually become stars.

Before you can say, ""I knew it"", our leads are in the middle of a nasty battle for power and O (Blake Lively)'s life. The boys' clear misunderstanding of what they're dealing with soon becomes clear, and Salma Hayek's monumental's ego sets off a series of incidents that will have the audience on their toes.The film's violence works on two different levels, with plenty of horrors implied and off the screen, but they still leave quite an impact on the audience, and there is the psychological violence as you realize that your loved ones are about to subjected to savage violence, whether they are innocent or not. The segments between Lively and Del Toro remind of you Stone's early work in ""Salvador"" and "" Midnight Express"" when humanity loses plenty of ground to violence.Hayek's cartel head is much fun to see, as we see her wild theatricals and yet, there is so much frustration and pain at the heart. She might not be all she shows, but there is no other way to survive here, and there is depth in the conversations between her and her prisoner. She is able to see the whole picture, but she is no visionary, and eventually she misjudges the consequences of what she started.There are several lessons in the film, but it is for the most part a typical Stone movie, showy, graphic, wild in its own design, and never boring. It's a perfect example of what he can deliver: an insightful and stylistic look at a contemporary issue in a different way.",Savages
48,dierregi,"Tries and fails to be edgy, manages to be cliche-ridden",1,6 July 2021,"Ben and Chon, the two pot-growing male leads are played by two actors I don't remember seeing before in other movies and if I had, I forgot about them, because they totally lack any quality that pertains to leading actors, let alone movie stars. The female lead is Blake Lively, playing O (short for Ophelia), a pot-head who shares love, life, sex and dope with the boys.Ben, Chon and O also do threesomes, in case you might wonder, as it is generously shown in the movie, together with O having sex separately with Ben and Chon. Is this in any way relevant to the plot? Not really, because the main plot is about a Mexican cartel threatening the boys into ""co-operation"" and guess what? The cartel is ruthless and we're shown plenty of gore (men being beheaded with a chainsaw; man being whipped and set on fire). This has all been done before, too many times.O's only purpose is to be damsel in distress and with such unoriginal premises it would have been difficult to make a good movie and in fact this isn't one. The simple plot meanders with too many secondary characters, useless scenes and idiotic dialogues. Del Toro as the bad Mexican guy does a decent job, but Hayek - contrary to the majority's opinion - does yet again the only thing she can do, playing ""fierce Mexican woman"". Since she's a woman from Mexico, that doesn't seem much of a stretch.Watch at your own risk: of boredom for Lively-everything-but- lively voice-over; or disgust for the excessive violence; or annoyance for the useless scenes (the killing of the lawyer; O and lover boys having sex and dining out; O going shopping; etc...)",Savages

Ever since Desperado, I have been a fan. Of course, who could forget the dance in From Dusk to Dawn.Now, except for Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta, the rest of the cast is a mystery to me. Naturally, I have seen many of them in other films, but they are very forgettable.Performances by the three mentioned were all very good. Just as I expected from seeing them in other films.

50,rgkarim,Less Action More Soap Opera,7,7 July 2012,"Another weekend, another set of movies to review and this time I'm starting with the latest ""action"" flick to grace the theaters. The movie I'm talking about is Savages, which stars Taylor Kitsch as Chon, Aaron Johnson as Ben, and Blake Lively as O, who are three lovers involved in an odd romantic situation. Perhaps what is even more unique about their lives is the business the three of them work in, which is none other than making illegal drugs to sell to various people in California. Although life seems to be great for the trio, and fairly hippy like, a wrench gets thrown into their gears when a big time drug cartel led by Elena (Salma Hayek). O's two lovers then decide they must do everything in their power to rescue her, or die trying as they set out into the drug underworld. Now if you're like me and you saw the trailers, this movie was made to look like an Army of Two tribute where two guys go in and overthrow Hispanic drug lords. Unfortunately I was fooled by the trailers yet again, since this movie is more a soap opera than anything else. Yes my friends those looking for shoot them up action are going to be disappointed as the only action in this movie comes from a couple of sniper shots, and few explosive blasts that look like something a teenage Michael Bay would dream up. The movie instead decided to swap the action with bloody torture scenes instead, which were a little grueling to watch as they really left no bloody details out. Now many might be ready for blood since the modern horror movie movement has desensitized most audience members. Unlike those movies though, the blood and dismemberment looks real and isn't a result of some cheesy, imaginary kill that takes away from the fake blood. There are also a few graphic rape scenes/sex scenes the crew was happy to show, which were a little more uncomfortable for this reviewer.Although a key aspect of this movie is torture and blood, there are some other features to this movie that are worth mentioning. For one thing the acting for most of the cast was excellent, most of them capturing the emotions and mannerisms of their characters. Kitsch for instance captures the soulless, ruthless, outlaw type of a soldier returning from war. Using his pent up emotions to drive his actions, Kitsch played the cold blooded hunter ready to take any steps to obtaining his price. Unlike John Carter though, most of his scenes involve him wearing a shirt, so sorry ladies you'll have to make due. Helping to counterbalance the aggressive fighter is Ben the negotiator, whose morals for making drugs are noble and admirable. Johnson had the right characteristics for the part; the calm eyes, the mellow persona, and the nervous energy during crucial decision were all well combined to give his character a conscience. Like the chemistry in X-men first class, Kitsch and Johnson are another dynamic duo that work well together to create tension and suspense in the scenes. As for Lively, well this role was a little more mellow and drug dependent for me, as her poetic lines and sullen mood were a little bland for my tastes. As for playing the victim, well she did a decent job playing a victim on the brink of giving up hope, yet at times she was a little one dimensional for a character. The bad guys however were actually well designed and crafted to help drive the plot and bring the audience's hatred to a boil. Lado (Benicio Del Toro) in particular was a villain who had the look and actions worthy of an enforcer, yet also had another side that gave his character a twisted edge that made him even deadlier.The character development was not the only thing that was well done. For me, the drug underworld was brought to life in this movie in both setting and storyline. The seedy nature and treacherous faces of the cartel were integrated and portrayed to show just how fragile the trust between members is. At any point you wonder who the heads are going to kill next, or wonder what means they are willing to take to get their goals. Like a chess match between two champions, the strategy and resourcefulness of the parties involved is realistically portrayed, though sometimes overstretched, to help keep the power struggle interesting. Yet, with this realism comes some graphic and heartbreaking kills that can take its toll on your emotions. Numerous shots to the head, various characters killed without remorse, and a soulless execution of savage acts gets a little old and tedious as the movie goes on. If the ending had been stronger and a little less vague, perhaps this violent killing over illegal drugs would have been a little more tolerable. Yet, the monologue at the end leaves the movie open for another sequel, and left me a little disappointed.Savages is definitely a movie that lives up to its title with its bloody tortures, shots to the head, and emotionless threatening games. The glorification of the synthesis and selling of illegal drugs for the right reasons is also a little disturbing to see. However, the great character development, setting, and portrayal of a drug cartel are definite strengths of this movie. As a result, my scores for this movie are the following: Crime/Drama/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.0 My suggestion, rent it and avoid the theater as there are no special effects or story lines that make it worth a trip to theater. So until next time my friends enjoy the movies and as always leave feedback to help me get better.",Savages
51,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Oliver Stinks,1,7 December 2017,"I always considered Oliver Stone to be one of Hollywood's most over- rated directors, starting with but not limited to Natural Born Killers (violence porn) and Platoon (war as a cartoon). But I can also grudgingly admit that JFK was a wildly entertaining political thriller whether or not it had a grain of truth to it. And I loved Wall Street because Michael Douglas telling all those working saps that ''greed is good'' made so many Occutards poop their short-pants. At this point, however, even die-hard Stonistas can't possibly be defending his work. He's just churning out bad movie after bad movie. This is a new low. The garish colors. The cheese-ball music. The porn scene at the beginning. Followed soon thereafter by violence porn. The grating narration (a Stone staple). I last 10 minutes but I enjoyed reading the negative reviews for at least an hour. So I got something out of it.",Savages
52,Rob_Taylor,Way better than you might think.,8,22 November 2012,"I'm guessing this is a bit of a Marmite movie. Even though I hate Marmite, I loved this movie. That is the wonder of Marmite! So we have a drug-growing, likable threesome that falls afoul of a drug cartel and has to go on the offensive when things turn ugly.So, things I took away from this movie, which isn't terribly realistic.1. Getting involved in the drug business (in any way, shape or form) is ultimately bad for you. Who knew? 2. Drug cartels are brutal and violent. Cops can be corrupt. Again, who knew.3. Love conquers all. Pretty obvious, that one.So, having been muscled in on by the cartel, our threesome decides to get out and skip town. But the nasty drug-lords want their prize (in this case a special type of pot grown by one of the guys). So they kidnap the shared girlfriend and hold the guys to ransom over their secrets.Savages is terribly violent, and not for the squeamish. It also glamorises the drug trade somewhat (though see point 1. above). There is also the three-way relationship between the two men and their shared lady, which some people, who only think in black and white, obviously, seem to find almost as objectionable as the drugs and violence.I won't argue for a minute that drugs are good, or that violence is always necessary in a movie. But here, it does work rather well. There is some confusion on the movie's part as to whether it wants to be deadly serious, or somewhat tongue-in-cheek. You can be faced with nasty, hideous violence one moment, and then you are laughing at the next scene. In short, it's a little bit Jekyll and Hyde. This can be a little bit unsettling, I grant you. It would have been better if they had stuck to one tonal level.Right, the threesome. Putting aside the various level of acting ability, what's wrong with that? Nothing. Someone said that ""O"" (the female of the triplet) was a slut and couldn't decide who she loved. Black and white thinking, sorry. It is perfectly possible for one person to love two people and no, they don't actually have to be emotionally damaged to do it. I'll grant you, that the dynamic and setup of this trio needed more explanation, but it was fairly well covered, in the scenes they did give us. But I'll help out the emotionally hard-of-understanding with the following simple summation: The guys both loved ""O"" so much that they would rather share her than forcing her to make a choice that could ruin their friendships, because, let's face it, if you are in that situation and forced to make a choice, you'll (""O"") choose neither (because it wouldn't be fair to choose one over the other) and go your separate ways, probably leading to the collapse of the guys friendship as well (they'll blame each other). In short, the relationship as it is, is a stable one.Phew! Right! Back to the characters! Well, the two guys are chalk and cheese. Most of the character development (there is some) is focused on Ben's character. He's the peace-loving one that goes down a bit of a dark path on the journey to rescue ""O"" from the drug lords. As portrayed, both Chon and ""O"" (I have no idea why I keep putting her name in quotes) are damaged individuals who rely on Ben to keep them grounded (even though they are more often than not high). Ben's journey damages them, because they have to witness it, and don't much like being reminded of their own faults, which Ben mirrors towards the end.It's a pretty brutal film overall, and not for everyone. I actually enjoyed it considerably because it was different from the usual Hollywood pap. I don't think it was one of Stone's best movies, but top marks to the guy for continuing to take on difficult matériel.The ending is best described as ""Marmite-within-Marmite"". Look what happened! Oh no! Wait, that wasn't it at all! But it does, at least, allow you to blank out one or the other in your head in order to satisfy your particular needs as regards an ending.I'll also point out that the threesome is a key ingredient in both endings and that neither ending is particularly satisfying to the viewer, making the point that things don't all work out for the best, even if characters live.SUMMATION: Dark and brutal and not for everyone's tastes. But it is a little different and that is what makes it enjoyable.TOP TIP: Not really a date movie. Do not take your girlfriend and her hot sister to see it thinking you might all end up in bed together. It won't end well.",Savages
53,brando647,SAVAGES is Brutal But Forgettable,6,29 January 2013,"I'm late to the Oliver Stone bandwagon. I've only seen a fraction of his films, but the few I've seen blew me away. At some point, I plan on delving further into his older films but I figured the least I can do is try and keep up with his contemporary work. So I was a bit excited to see SAVAGES because I was such a fan of the few other of his films that I'd seen. The trailers made it look like a brutal film set in the world of drug trafficking and the cast was impressive: John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro, Selma Hayek, and Aaron Johnson (KICK-ASS, NOWHERE BOY). It's based on a novel from author Don Winslow that I'll admit I've never read and probably never will. Not that I'm averse to reading, I just wasn't too impressed with SAVAGES. The worst part is, I can't really figure out why. All the elements are here to be a gripping crime drama but it falls sort of flat. SAVAGES centers on Ben (Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch), two best friends in the business of growing and selling marijuana. With the business booming and their shared lover O (Blake Lively), their lives are fantasticuntil a Mexican cartel wants in on their business. Ben and Chon want nothing to do with the dangers of cartel business but they discover that you can't just turn them away and expect no consequences. O is taken as collateral, and Ben and Chon begin a two-man war against drug lord La Reina in an attempt to rescue their woman.SAVAGES is a slick film and it's beautifully shot. The scenes in Laguna Beach are bright and colorful while the world of the cartel is dark, brooding, and filthy. I doubt anyone could say the movie looks anything but amazing. Oliver Stone and cinematographer Daniel Mindel did an awesome job showing the contrast between these two worlds. The cast of the film is just as great. Just about everyone in the film leaves their mark. Travolta has a minor role as a sleazy DEA agent and it's good to see him in a quality movie again. Del Toro is a scene- stealer as Lado, the main enforcer for La Reina's cartel. He's a real beast. The extended/unrated edition is better in that it gives you more scenes with Lado and you get to see the man's family life and how he can go from a softball game to a decapitation without batting an eye. Then we have the main trio of characters: Ben, Chon, and O. Blake Lively is the weak link here. Maybe it's just how her character was written, but I didn't care for her and her constant whimpering and dopey demeanor. Yes, her character is in the worst scenario but I don't know why she couldn't show more strength and will to survive without the whining. Ben and Chon are great. Aaron Johnson continues to impress me as a new face in movies and Kitsch earns a few more karma points to make up for his involvement in X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE.There are a lot of people complaining about the ending to this movie, and I agree. It's a total cop-out. I will spare the details here but let's just say that the movie heads in one direction at the end (a pretty good direction) but then changes it's mind and goes for the fairy tale ""happily-ever-after"" that no one expects from a movie with cartel violence. I was fine with the movie until that point. The movie plods along at a very deliberate pace but I rarely found myself bored. I didn't walk away with great thoughts on the film, but for the time that I was watching it I was totally engaged. It was the characters. They're just really interesting to watch (especially any scenes with Lado). The movie has some brutal scenes of graphic violence, but it doesn't feel like a violent movie. The scenes are few but effective. Most of the dealings with the cartel are bizarrely civilized, though the threat of death always looms over Ben and Chon. The one thing I really loved about the movie was its theme of savagery. I loved that we saw the situation from both perspectives. Ben and Chon believe the cartel to be violent savages who jump at the chance to impale a man on a pike if it means sending a message, while the cartel views Ben and Chon as savages who don't know how to properly handle business.I doubt SAVAGES would be considered one of Stone's best but it's an engaging watch. Great performances and a thrilling, violent story save the movie from mediocrity, but there are some story elements and a weak ending that keep this from rising to become anything more.",Savages
54,bob-rutzel-1,"Good, but somewhat too brutal",7,30 December 2012,"O (Blake Lively) is kidnapped by a Mexican drug cartel when Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) turn down a deal to work with the cartel. Most of the movie has Chon and Ben trying to free O from the cartel. The movie opens with a graphic sex act between Chon and O, and to shock the sudience like this is pure amateur hour. There is another sex act later on but not as intense. So much for family viewing. I believe director Oliver Stone was thinking he is still in the 1980s.What was brutal were the killings, beheadings, torture and savage behavior in general. Benicio Del Toro, as Lado, one of the cartel leaders can possibly be the scariest man on the planet when he wants to be. And, apparently in here, he wanted to be. Hey, I was looking up the number for the FBI to get away from him. But, it was here that I remembered that John Travolta was playing Dennis, a corrupt FBI agent, working both sides to keep his cushy life. So calling the FBI was out. What to do? What to do?Blake Lively as O does a voice-over narration throughout the movie to tell us her history with Chon and Ben, and what may happen. In some ways, this is informative and in other ways: annoying. If she were THE central character, then that would have worked.Chon and Ben, the lead characters, didn't really act in here. They reacted. This was Benicio Del Toro's movie. No question about that. Salma Hayek as Elena, the cartel leader, was miscast as she wasn't convincing in that role. We are shown 2-shooting finales. One where almost everyone dies and the other where almost no one dies. I hope this is not a trend for future action-shoot'em- ups. Oh sure, O assures us the shooting where almost everyone dies DID NOT really happen except in her mind. Uh-huh! Hey, I am not up for being shown different possible realities in this reality. Make a decision and stick with it. Overall, well acted, but too scary and brutal in many places. I'm still looking for that number. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, in the opening scenes, and one more later on but not as intense. Nudity: Yes, later on in the movie. Torture: Yes. Language: Yes.",Savages
55,moviexclusive,"Riveting, edge-of-your-seat thriller that invites you to revel in its lurid excesses of violence and sex – just ignore its copout of a second ending",7,18 September 2012,"Lest we forget that the Oliver Stone of 'Natural Born Killers' and 'U Turn' was the same Oliver Stone who did 'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' and 'World Trade Centre', the pulpy side of the once disreputable director has returned with potent force in this violent, sexual and all-round intense drug-cartel drama. Indeed, the helmer, who also co-wrote the screenplay of Don Winslow's 2010 bestseller, is clearly having a blast returning to his lurid roots, and the result is a trippy experience that will leave you riveted – that is, until a copout of an ending, but more on that later.""It's that kind of story where things just got so out of control,"" says Ophelia Sage, aka O, in her opening voice-over, warning us that just because she is narrating the story does not mean that she will be alive by the end of it. So in 'hip-speak', O introduces us to the odd couple Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) – the former a Berkeley business/botany double major and the latter an ex-Navy Seal. Their personalities couldn't be more different as well – the soft-spoken Ben is pacifist, and volunteers his time helping out the less unfortunate in far-flung places like Asia; the impulsive Chon is just fine staying behind in Laguna Beach hanging out with his war buddies from Afghanistan and Iraq.In any other circumstance, Ben and Chon probably wouldn't be associated with each other, but in their line of work, both need each other. With Ben as the brains and Chon as the brawn, they run a wildly successful business growing some of the best and most potent marijuana in the world – the THC content in their product is at a never heard before 33 percent. At the centre of their lives is O, one of those vacuous rich- girl types who thinks she is living the life loving the both of them at the same time. Both Ben and Chon are equally guilty of naivety – you don't get to run such a multimillion drug business without attracting some unwanted attention.Trouble calls in the form of the Mexican Baja Cartel, headed by the diminutive Elena (Salma Hayek in a scene-stealing supporting role) who wants a piece of their business. ""They are Wal-Mart,"" crooked DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) tells the boys, ""And they want you for a specialty aisle."" Thinking that they can outsmart Elena by jumping town, the duo are forced to scramble when Elena's ruthless henchman Lado (Benicio Del Toro) kidnaps O and threatens her slow painful death unless they play ball. Naturally they do, while raising hell by waging their own war – with some help of course from Chon's military friends – against Elena's expansive United States operations as well as ultimately her own flesh and blood.Higher-brow audiences may try to find deeper meaning in the film's depiction of morality – especially as Ben and Chon resort to the same methods (among them, torture) that Elena employs in order to gain the upper hand. Laudable though their intentions may be, it is ultimately futile in our opinion – for Stone is too big a fan of titillation and garish brutality to adopt a measured tone to a material with so much potential for excess. With propulsive flair, Stone directs the movie with a nervous jittery energy that suits the material perfectly. Under Stone's hand therefore, it is an exercise in provocation, one designed to get a reaction out of his audience whether O's psychological and physical torture under Lado or the latter's vicious interrogation of a suspected traitor within their midst.The colourful Elmore Leonard-style noir is also enlivened by its ensemble cast, the supporting ones of which unfortunately outshine that of its three leading actors. Of these three protagonists, only Johnson's Ben develops any real dimension as his character loses his initial ingenuousness and turns into a cold-hearted liar cum murderer. Kitsch and Lively are fine in their respective roles, but next to veterans Travolta, Hayek and del Toro, they sadly appear lightweight. Yes, the most exciting performances here belong to the three supporting actors – Travolta wickedly amusing in his smarminess; Hayek impressively cool as the chic drug lord; and del Toro sizzling with diabolical menace. A scene where Travolta tries to wheedle out of his accused duplicity by del Toro counts as the best in the movie, both actors gleefully playing up their respective roles.Such a terrific buildup of story and cast should guarantee a thrilling climax, and indeed Stone delivers just that – the only problem is he backtracks for a second ending that will have you screaming 'WTF!'. It's a meta-stunt all right, one that tries to prove that the movie is smarter than just your well-made B-movie, but executed with flippancy as it is done here, the otherwise timid finish leaves you feeling cheated. Still, on the strength of the rest of the movie, we are willing to look past this glaring flaw and appreciate Stone's work for what it is. Like we said, this won't be your politically important films like 'Born on the Fourth of July', 'Platoon' or 'Nixon', but – especially with the recent passing of Tony Scott – this is a rare exhilarating, edge-of- your-seat thriller from an A-list director that will satisfy your appetite for lurid pleasures.",Savages
56,saadgkhan,Time-pass sexually and torturous venture #NothingRemarkable,6,12 November 2012,"Savages - CATCH IT (B) Savages is based upon gutsy novel of the same name. It's a tragic love story of two young marijuana growers Chon & Ben in Laguna Beach and their shared girlfriend ""O"". Their perfect life turns upside down when Mexican drug cartel who decide to take over Cali marijuana business and on refusal from Chon and Ben to join their business they kidnapped the beloved shared girlfriend ""O"". The premise of the movie is quite interesting and gutsy and to some extant Oliver Stone was able to catch that brutality and grimes. Even though the movie is a fast paced thriller & filled with young stunning cast and strong supporting cast. There is something which doesn't jell together well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Taylor Kitsch did a nice job but somehow they couldn't bring the passion and love between Jon and Cho. It's nothing sexual but something unspeakable of a sort. To me they seemed like just two business partners than anyone who would die for each other. Casting Blake Lively has to be the biggest mistake of the movie, since after watching this it's clear she is not equipped to present the emotional hardcore love. I had defended Blake Lively in her previous roles but watching her in Savages clearly raises questions regarding her talent. Even though she did good when she gets kidnapped but her sappy voice over and not so much chemistry with the boys was clearly visible. Whole time while watching Savages on one hand I was glad Jennifer Lawrence choose The Hunger Games over this but on the other hand I imagined what she would have brought to this emotionally and sexually charged O loving two guys immensely. Salma Hayek, John Travolta, Benicia Del Toro and Mia Maestro did a fine job. Now let's talk about the double ending which clearly shows that Oliver Stone was confused till the end how to end the movie the way it ended in the novel ""very ballsy"" or choose the safe way..! Sadly he decide to keep both in such manner that even what suppose to be a happy ending looks like a studio's decision rather the director or writer. In the end, the movie is gritty, violent and hardcore but less chemistry between the main three characters makes it hard to believe they would go to that exact for each other.",Savages
57,rivertam26,Yes Oliver Stone is back!,8,11 July 2012,"Oh how lucky you are Blake Lively. And not just because you get to have sex with gorgeous hunks like Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch but because you get to be in a real Oliver Stone flick not the fake crap he's been releasing over the last few years. Savages is a welcome return for the director to much darker material after years of generic Hollywood throw aways like World Trade Center, Alexander, W. and Wall Street 2. In the vein of his classic flicks like Natural Born Killers he returns with a vengeance. The film tells the tale well actually is narrarated by the central female character O short for Ophelia played by Gossip Girl Blake Lively who recently impressed in Ben Affleck's The Town. It concerns two best friends who are also indie drug dealers and in love with the same woman. A Mexican drug cartel run by Salma Hayek makes them an offer they shouldn't refuse and the chaos ensues as O is kidnapped and the boys will do whatever it takes to get her back.Brutal violent setpieces, inspired plotting and a surprisingly original love story that makes the love triangle feel believable in the sense that if you dig a little deeper the guys love each other and O's character is just the binding material that holds them together. It's a bromance for 2012 and done with a surprising amount of appreciated mucho zest and some truly steamp sex scenes. i remember films like these in the 90's True Romance, Natural Born Killers, hell even Pulp Fiction. they don't make them like this anymore. It's a vicious jolt of cinematic energy and artistic integrity folded into grade A American entertainment. That being said even though it's a big step in the right direction for Stone. I'm not sure if it was studio intereference but the film does cut away from some scenes that could have lingered for effect as well as a somewhat sappy finale. As for the performances Taylor Kisch does a solid job of proving that he actually has plausible range as an actor and Aaron Johnson of Kick ass is utterly unrecognizable and has some of the films most emotionally resonant moments. Salma Hayek has her juciest role in possibly her career as the central villain and Benecio Del Toro, John Travolta and Emile Hirsch come along for some solid support. And as for our Gossip Girl although she has moments I'm just not sure she's ready for this much of a movie. That being said she isn't bad but promising and likable. The movie moves along at a kinetic pacing and is engagingly suspenseful the small faults of the somewhat unnecessary narration and repettive reminding of the movies title are easily overlooked because of the sheer bad assedness the movie possess one of the best of the year!",Savages

59,Screen_Blitz,"Stylish, entertaining, but gritty Oliver Stone thriller",8,14 October 2015,"Oliver Stone, the amazing director behind the Vietnam War flicks Platoon (1986), Born on The Fourth of July (1989), and Heaven & Earth (1993), makes a credible return on his dark, gritty film style with this violent, grim crime-thriller showing a bleak portrayal of international drug exchanging set on the sun-soaked side of southern California. Aaron Johnson plays Ben, a soft and peace-loving entrepreneur who owns a pot-growing business, selling some of best marijuana in the world, with his best friend Chon (played by Taylor Kitsch), a former NAVY seal veteran with a less merciful and more ruthless character who is often involved in violent confrontations against drug lords, unlike Ben prefers to live a life without violence and brutality. These two share a smoking, hot girlfriend named O a.k.a Ophelia (played by Blake Lively). However, when the two receive a business offer from a sadistic Mexican drug lord Lado (played by Benicio Del Toro) and his partner Elena (played by Salma Hayek), O is kidnapped and held hostage by Lado and his henchman. Ben and Chon must come with the money to save her from the vicious drug cartel, with the help of a corrupt DEA agent Denis (played by John Travolta).This movie doesn't quite hike up the peak of Oliver Stone's previous films, but its still entertaining as it needs to be; despite some of its flaws. With this film set in a coastal city of Laguna Beach, California, the cinematography uses some very high saturation to give the environment a sharp, colorful look. The plot is starts off a pretty solid note as we are introduced the backgrounds of the main characters Ben and Chon with Blake Lively's character's narration, including the story of Chon acquired the seeds to grow the marijuana plants. After that, the development of the characters stops there. While the plot moves pretty well more most of the first half, it eventually descends into an inconsistent mess in the second half. From there on, the story leaves a few plot holes here and there. However, the film still manages to be compelling and gritty in a way that still keeps the plot going. As the film goes on, it gets darker and more sinister, and progresses into a very mean atmosphere. With their girlfriend held hostage, the main characters get involved gunfights against cartel members that get quite bloody and gruesome at times. There is also a horrifying torture scene with some grisly results. So the film can does a bit brutal and tough to watch, but is still entertaining for the least.Savages may not be one of Oliver Stones's best films, but it still manages to be captivating. Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro are great in this, as well as Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch, even though their characters are a bit underdeveloped. However, this movie is extremely violent and brutal, and it is not recommended for those with weak stomachs.",Savages
60,Troy_Campbell,Cool and pretentious in equal measure.,6,18 October 2012,"Unrelenting in both violence and pot-fuelled philosophy, Oliver Stone's warring-drug-factions tale is occasionally tough to sit through – especially with its bloated runtime – but succeeds overall thanks to a collection of charismatic turns from the reliable cast. Benicio del Toro steals the show as the ruthless cartel enforcer who gleefully tortures, murders and rapes at will; the Oscar winner spits and sneers with frightening force. Youngsters Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Johnson and Blake Lively (who provides the useless narration) are excellent as the leading trio and Salma Hayek and John Travolta add a bit of colour in their smaller but pivotal roles. There's a superb hijacking set piece at the midway point that proves Stone can still handle action, whilst his wacky directorial flourishes are sometimes cool and sometimes pretentious; the less said about the infuriating cop-out finale the better. Despite its imperfections Savages is worth seeing, but wait until it's on DVD.",Savages
61,antoniotierno,gritty and tough entertainment,8,30 October 2012,"This movie renews the energy of depleted themes — drug related violence, drug wealth, California dreaming and Mexican cartel. The violence is graphic and the style are often mannered but this long and dense adventure takes surprising trips into thoughtfulness, ruefulness and romance as well. While the savagery of ""Savages"" emanates firstly from the cartel, the story tracks the increasingly desperate measures that the lead actors take to secure the safety of the woman they both adore, and to take a sweet revenge. ""Savages "" is a bit too long in terms of runtime, which is not a surprise in Oliver Stone's productions.",Savages
62,napierslogs,Entertaining crime thriller devolving into nauseating romantic drama,5,11 July 2012,"Have you ever wanted to see a crime thriller turned into a romantic drama? Probably not. That's why ""Savages"" is far from a ""must see"" movie. It's one of those movies that is all over the map – literally and metaphorically, in all possible ways. We go from a romantic idealistic drug world, to a crooked DEA agent, to a violent comedy-filled drug world, to a philosophy on life and love all with stops in between for a three-way romance.Let's start with the three-way romance. It involves three actors with widely varying degrees of competence playing three characters who are supposed to be completely different from one another. Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is an army vet fresh from tours of Iraq and Afghanistan ready to turn their pot business into a typical drug business. Ben (Aaron Johnson) is a peace-loving, Buddhism-embracing hippie botanist growing pot just for the love of growing pot. Ophelia (Blake Lively) goes by 'O' and she claims she's the only one holding them together. She mentioned, but then she must have forgotten, that they were friends long before they met her. Just to clear up any confusion, Aaron Johnson is the talented one of the bunch.I'm not sure when exactly Blake Lively lost her charisma but it could have something to do with the lack of substance to her character. O is the narrator, trying to explain love to us, defining 'savages' for us, and then being our connection to this messed up world where American business partners get caught up in the drug war with the Mexican cartel. The problems are that she is wrong, inconsistent and unnecessary. There are much better ways to introduce us to this violent drug war than using some two-timing, blonde, beach floozy.It turns out that O is consequential to the plot, and it actually is a good plot. The Mexicans want Chon and Ben's business but they don't want to give it to them. So the Mexican's take something else, and Ben and Chon have to resort to lies, violence, trickery, criminal actions and some more double-crossings. This takes place as they are all caught between the paradise beaches of California and the gritty streets of Mexico. Against my better judgement, I was enjoying myself as Chon and Ben used everything up their sleeves to get what they wanted.""Savages"" is entertaining with the violence inter-cut with comedic one-liners, and then gratuitous sex thrown in for no good reason. But this is perhaps one of Oliver Stone's poorest written and realized films. The original idea was probably much better in his head.",Savages
63,Prashast_Singh,An intriguing crime action film.,10,6 December 2020,"Savages is like one of those crime action movies where everything is both intense and extreme. From violence to language to sexual content, the film is high on all these fronts and yet manages to look beautiful, thanks to the color palette. The story is pretty simple, but it's also very fun to watch. We get three really bizarre leading characters and same goes for the villains. Once the conflict is set up, we get a heavy dose of explosive action and suspense.Touching topics such as drugs, Savages is clearly not for kids. Even adults who can't stomach the excessive brutal violence aren't really recommended to watch it either. Just think of it as a stylized action flick that simply pushes the envelope and makes complete usage of its R rating. There's an unrated cut too!Performance-wise, we have a lot to appreciate here. All the actors appear convincing enough in their roles to make you continue with watching till the end. The climax sequence is really ingenious, in my opinion. No, I won't spoil it. Enjoy it for yourself. The visuals, as mentioned before, are pretty gorgeous, eventually demanding a high-quality watch.So in the end, Savages is just a fun action film with enough intensity and adrenaline to keep you glued. It's indeed pretty violent and mature, and that must be kept in mind before you start watching it.",Savages
64,areatw,I hated everything about this film,3,22 April 2017,"'Savages' is a thoroughly unlikeable film with a poor plot, weak script and some seriously bad acting. From the opening scene alone I got the impression that this was going to be yet another pretentious piece of garbage, and I was right.The narration is highly annoying, as are virtually all of the characters. It's more of a comedy than a thriller and it can be especially difficult to take Blake Lively's acting seriously. There's a few decent action scenes but that's as far as the positives go as far as I'm concerned. I hated everything else about this film.",Savages
65,rockman182,Savages,6,22 July 2012,"I'm normally quite a fan of Oliver Stone's work, but right off the bat I think this is his weakest effort. It looked good from the trailers, but doesn't really materialize. Parts feel labored and underdeveloped. My main problem came from Blake Lively. She was awful, and knowing her from Gossip Girl I expected the worst. I could get past her always sounding like she has marbles in her mouth, but I could feel no empathy for her character whatsoever. Don't know how to identify with a character who sleeps with two guys at once because she ""loves both"". The next obvious problem comes from the ending. I can't say much without giving away spoilers, so I won't go into it. All I'm going to say is that it was a joke how it ultimately turned out. You will have to have seen the film to know what I mean.Overall, I had much higher expectations for the film. It was just average at best.",Savages
66,khanbaliq2,A violent crime thriller that manages to entertain despite its flaws.,7,3 December 2013,"I got a kick out of reading the popular Hated It reviews about Savages. It's all very funny. It's the same with some other films that Oliver Stone made in recent years. But is Savages really that bad? In my opinion it's not that bad. It's a fine film actually. But its flaws can be irritating. When I began watching the film I wondered if I turned on a dirty movie. But no. That was just Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ophelia (Blake Lively) having their special time. Maybe it's not that special because later Ophelia has the same time with Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). I hope Stone included these scenes just to show that these three are very close. Fine. A little later though viewers are treated to what passes as a commercial promoting the use of marijuana. Fine. The three lead actors show little range throughout the film. But I didn't think that this was a problem because it keeps the film entertaining instead of too dramatic. It's entertaining but it's not easy to watch sometimes. It's a simplified, glossy, watered-down and often violent representation of the War on Drugs and Mexican drug dealing. The Mexican Drug War is still ongoing and several dozen thousand people have been killed because of it. For anyone who doesn't know I'll mention that the war is just a result of America's economic policies. So-called free trade drove millions of Mexicans out of work and into poverty and crime. On the other side of the world, in Afghanistan, the Americans and the British have deliberately increased opium production for export to neighboring countries, especially to Russia. Genocide as a result of drug use and drug trafficking is an old British trick that goes back centuries. It's an interesting topic but I don't pay much attention to it. Savages is kind of a peek inside, though it doesn't get into the seriousness of the issue. Even if Kitsch, Johnson, and Lively aren't sympathetic leads the film still has memorable performances from Salma Hayek, Benicio del Toro and John Travolta. The screenplay by Shane Salerno, Don Winslow and Stone can be considered a cheat. It doesn't just raise a question mark at the very beginning of the film, which I didn't like. It also tarnishes the ending. I would have just preferred the upbeat version without the downbeat version. But, like I mentioned, it's an entertaining film that does have something to say. Its running time is a little over two hours, however the time goes by fast. For me Savages turned out to be an engaging film. Dan Mindel's appealing cinematography is a benefit too. I didn't think that I'd like it when I saw the trailer, but it's a well-directed crime thriller. I recommend it.",Savages
67,natashabowiepinky,Savages,6,4 February 2014,"Yes... it's Oliver Stone, Hollywood's favourite conspiracy theorist director, making a film all about drugs. Is he possibly trying to make a political point here? If he is, I can't see it. What there is though, is an all-star entourage of A-listers, in a Traffic style narrative which runs for at least half an hour too long. With the amount of talent associated with this product though, there are bound to be some redeeming features along the way... and the reasonably fast paced, thrilling plot provides move than enough compensation. Salma Hayek is icily effective as the head of a smuggling racket, while Benicio Del Toro does what he can with his role as a truly despicable individual who works for her. After watching this, I defy anyone with a conscience to not want to kill this dude.Considering the illegal acts the main three get up to, not to mention their selfish hedonistic lifestyles... it's very difficult to 'cheer' for them. If anything, they're the lesser of two evils... What we're being told is they're always going to be nefarious substances going around the world, so it's better to leave them in the hands of the independent dealers rather than the major cartels. Hmm... Interesting moral. Not sure I can get on board with that, but each to their own. Anyway, it's worth watching at least once, if only for the unique novelty of having TWO endings. Personally, I preferred the former... 6/10",Savages

Brutal and realistic action in a movie which is pacey and powerful.I enjoyed this film and in my view the actress playing the head of the Mexicans gave the stand out performance: Salma Hayek.Benicio Del Toro comes a close second.Everyone in the play is a drug dealer or aiding and abetting it. Many people would describe these drug crimes as hideous so the question is, why should the viewer have any sympathy for anyone in the picture(?).What makes the film is the very clever climax and conclusion and along with the rest of this show I can give it a sound:7/10",Savages
69,gregsrants,Not Exactly Classic Stone,5,6 July 2012,"When I began to see trailers for Oliver Stone's new film Savages, I got a tad excited. Stone has been a rut for far too long. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, W, Alexander – they were all disappointments. Especially since they were coming from the man who brought us Natural Born Killers, Platoon and Wall Street.But early clips and trailers had me hold out hope that Savages was more Scarface than World Trade Centre. More JFK than Nixon.The result is a mix of good and bad. A mix that ultimately leaves your appetite slightly unnourished.As trailers clearly spell out, Savages is full of guns, drugs and threesomes. It stars Taylor Kitsh (Chon) and Aaron Johnson (Ben) as two entrepreneurs who deal in the selling of drugs – specifically marijuana. They are connected by O (Blake Lively) who just so happens to be intimate with both of the business partners.Complicating their already head scratching personal life is a Latin drug cartel lead by the Uma Thurman wig-wearing Salma Hayak (Elena) and her murderous group of minions that include lead bad guy Lado (Benicio Del Toro). Elena has reached out to the two drug dealing boys in an attempt to form a lucrative partnership, but Chon and Ben see things differently and wish to continue on their own. This decision sits about as well as a jalapeno in a baby's stomach and Elena orders Lado to nab O to force the boys' hands.The above synopsis does read like classic 80's Stone fare. And since Mr. Stone was also part of the screen writing team which adapted Don Winslow's book of the same name, again expectations were high.Unfortunately, the story gets muddled and the characters are interesting, but hardly strike a chord with audience wherein you would care or not whether they live, die, or have their heads detached from their bodies. And John Travolta (who appears as a Federal Agent) just smirks along to what would only be considered as a paycheck role.Add too that the dialogue (including a poorly written narration) is at times groanable - ""Chon is cold metal, Ben is warm wood"" . And I won't even share a comment on a reference to something called 'wargasms'.There is still plenty however to cheer about. Although the opening and the two (yes, two) endings were nothing special, the meat of the film is filled with lots of hard violence and fun that will likely make Savages a perfect rental when available before the end of the year.But outside of the moments where Stone is ensuring the MPAA has no choice but to classify the film with an R-Rating, the movie is just violent fluff. It's a vicious unpleasant film that stretches for over two hours and just made us long for next season's Breaking Bad.www.killerreviews.com",Savages
70,mario_c,"ELENA ""La Reina"" is not that savage",7,26 April 2013,"The most recent movie from Oliver Stone, SAVAGES, is an action thriller about the drugs' business in California. The cast is good as it has so many well-known names of the seventh art, like Salma Hayek, Benicio del Toro, or John Travolta. The plot is not bad too and I think it's the one expected to a movie like this, with some action scenes and some blood. The characters I think they aren't so ""two dimensional"" and superficial as some IMDb users said, especially the one played by Salma Heyk, ELENA ""La Reina"" as they call her in the movie. I think this character is really deep as she acts in a very opposite way to what would be expectable for a headmaster of a drug cartel. At the end we see she's probably less savage than the majority in this movie(SPOILER) But talking about the end I must say I found pretty ridiculous these ""two endings"" the movie has. I mean a ""Hollywood happy ending"" as it is the ""second ending"", would be nice as an alternative ending in the DVD extras or something, but introduce it in the movie was pretty lame! The ""first ending"", which is where the movie should have ended, is pretty better and more realistic than the second one, I think!

Blake who is taken, instead of being tortured by her captures and living a terrible life.... she is treated like a queen. She gets everything she wants and is well taken care of, even eats stake and smokes pot. The guys who are trying to save ""O"" the girlfriend, soon became lame. They had military friends and training and such, I thought it was going to be another ""Taken"" film where there's hardcore shootouts and a slaughter as they try to save the girlfriend.

There are no real good guys in this movie, unless you romanticize drug dealers. If you do, then the movie to see is the 2001 movie Blow with Johnny Depp; I've seen just about all the drug dealing based movies and few come close to it. Getting back to Savages, I have to say that despite a not so original scenario, the movie keeps the pace upbeat enough and has sufficiently interesting scenes to garner a slightly better than average rating (by average I mean a 6). I watched it to the end and to be honest, it was because Benicio Del Toro played a supporting role. For some reason, I watch all the movies he plays in even if half have been a disappointment; the good ones seem to make up for the bad ones. I have nothing much to say about Travolta anymore, not until he starts acting; he hasn't since Primary Colors, though he's had a bunch of terrific parts that made him look good.

78,CANpatbuck3664,Savages is Too Long and Filled With Frustratingly Dumb Characters,4,23 February 2017,"This was an attempted comeback by Oliver Stone to a harder and edgier subject, the war on drugs. What I found is that several people in this movie were looking for a comeback hit; Taylor Kitsch was coming of a couple of box office disasters, Aaron Taylor-Johnson hasn't had a hit since Kick Ass, Blake Lively is returning to the screen after Green Lantern and Hick. They have a lot of solid actors in this cast and Stone seems like the right guy to direct this. I mean drugs, guns, the mob, where could this go wrong? But the bottom line is that a lot of people need this movie to hit it big and while it did get decent reviews, I have to tell you it's not going to get that kind of praise from me.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The film is narrated by O (Blake Lively) and she introduces us to the situation. She is a young woman carrying on a devils three way of a romance with 2 marijuana dealers named Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch). They grow the best pot on the west coast of the United States. Each of them brings something to the operation. Ben has a degree from Cal-Berkeley in botany and is the brains behind the actual growing of the weed. He's essentially a hippie, he's very non-violent and believes in conducting business that way. Chon is the muscle. He is a former Navy SEAL who came back from Afghanistan with a love of cannabis and some PTSD. He is the aggression behind the operation. I would like to clarify though, he's not outwardly violent but if they have to intimidate to collect from a client, it's him running the call.The 3 of them are enjoying a thriving business. They have a great reputation with their suppliers and their customers. They also have an inside man in the DEA named Dennis (John Travolta) who watches their back. One day, they get a very violent video message from the Mexican drug cartel thug Lado (Benicio Del Toro) telling them they want to meet up and talk business. Ben is overseas and Chon and O are too stoned to properly comprehend it. After Ben gets back they talk amongst themselves about it and then they talk to Dennis who tells them that they don't really have a choice.I have to admit, reading the plot summary I could objectively see how this is a pretty cool set up. But where I thought this movie fell down was that it missed the ABCs of doing a story where the filmmakers want us to care about the fates of the characters they present to us. A) Make the characters at least relatively easy to like, or they should at least have redeeming characteristics. The biggest reason why this movie didn't connect with me is that I was so frustrated with how these people behave in stressful situations. O was the biggest problem, she's carrying on a stupid love triangle and she has no skills except being hot. When she's taken she whines to her captors about the food, her weed withdrawal and ultimately even about her not knowing who the group's leader is. You don't sympathize with Ben because he was an idiot not to know that this was going to happen. Chon is maybe the most honest character but he is so wooden (his character not Kitsch) that the movie makes it clear he's not fully human. Lado enjoys torturing and killing people. Dennis is a two-timing rat and Elena is a ruthless but ultimately soft leader with little dimension outside the fact she misses her family. I had no reason to care about any of these people and it was like watching a sporting event where you don't care who wins.B) Telling an interesting story is priority number one. I will at least give this movie credit for having a coherent plot line; most movies I hate lack that. But what parts of this story that are interesting are either wrecked by increasingly pointless bits of violence or are stretched out over the movie's ridiculous run time. This movie should have been 30 minutes shorter. The plot continues to jump around via O's uninteresting narration and repeatedly kills any momentum it is building. This movie could have been just a stupid revenge action movie with a lot of violence and guns and I would have liked it so much better. They had an interesting premise but the twists the story takes undercut it completely.Okay, I've ripped on this movie enough, let's get to some of the more admirable aspects. Stone puts a lot of effort into developing a visual style for the movie. Normally I would like this but it didn't mean a whole lot when I was so frustrated with the characters and the meandering plot. But I can respect the effort that was put in to it. I also thought some of the acting was o.k. I would give Selma Hayek and Taylor Kitsch the best marks. I don't like Aaron Taylor-Johnson here, he seems really unemotional, he's just not effective in Savages. Del Toro has zip dimension to his character and all he does is betray and torture people, he's better in Sicario. Travolta was fine and Blake Lively has been good in other things but I couldn't enjoy her performance because of her character.I started out wanting to like this movie. I could tell it was going to be edgy but I just got so tired of it by the end and I just gradually grew more and more angry with it. There's no excuse for the terrible characterization or the 2+ hours this movie takes to wrap up. There were okay points but that doesn't redeem Savages.",Savages
79,Laakbaar,Too violent,6,20 October 2012,"I knew the film would be violent, but I wasn't expecting it to be as graphically violent as it was. I simply didn't enjoy the extreme violence in this movie. How is this entertainment? Who enjoys seeing people getting tortured and killed? I thought of walking out, but I stuck it out.The movie's depiction of Mexican drug cartels and Mexican criminals was just depressing. Benicio Del Toro in particular played a very unpleasant character. It annoyed me every time he was on screen.It also felt to me that the movie was glorifying the criminal actions of the main characters. I saw them from the beginning as nothing more than criminals and druggies. My main reaction to their plight was to think they deserved all of it for getting into drug production and trafficking in the first place. It astonished me that Stone expected us to care what happened to them.It wasn't just O, Chon and Ben. It was everyone in this movie. I suppose that was the idea; after all, the film is called ""Savages"". Sorry, I just wasn't into it.I went to this movie for two reasons. One reason was to experience Oliver Stone's artistry. And there's plenty of that. Stone's films are always visually rich, the camera lingering on details that add to our understanding of the characters and the setting. It makes his movies longer though.The second reason was to ogle Tyler Kitsch. Kitsch played the only character in the movie I cared about. My eyeballs are still scorched from the scene of Kitsch and Lively going at it. It would have been awesome to see a similar scene between Kitsch and Taylor-Johnson during one of their threesomes. But I don't think America is ready, and Stone probably knows that. In the end this is the irony of this movie: Stone can show the viewers horror after horror, but a little action between two guys who love each other would have you screaming in outrage. Welcome to the American movie world.",Savages
80,TheSquiss,"Maybe not profound, but brutal, compelling, memorable and enthralling. This is Oliver Stone on form!",8,27 September 2012,"Savages, the first of my double bill tonight, is Oliver Stone's nineteenth feature as director in a career that has so far won him three Oscars and a fair share of both critical acclaim (Platoon) and vitriolic vituperation (Alexander). It's impossible to know which Stone will be on duty with each release until you hand over paper and take your seat. Savages won't trouble the Academy in February but this is Stone fairly close to the top of his game.Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) contrast each other in almost every way emotionally and in their approach to life but they are best friends, business partners and share their lives, their home and their girl, O (Blake Lively). Their business is drugs but not in the seedy, council flat, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels kind of way but in the scientific, multi-million, California kind of way. Life is fun, cash is plentiful and there's even Dennis (John Travolta), a bent DEA agent, vaguely on their side to ensure everything runs smoothly. Then the Mexican Baja Cartel, headed by Elena (Salma Hayek) and her bulldog, Lado (Benicio Del Toro) decide they want a slice of the pie and kidnap O as gentle persuasion.Savages doesn't have anything new or profound to say about drug smuggling or the multitudinous crimes tied up in the drag trade and there's no great political slant or revelation, which is disappointing after such bold statements from Stone in the likes of JFK and Nixon. But it is a ripping good yarn and there are times when it's just blisteringly fine entertainment. It looks beautiful. The frames are saturated with rich colours and the cinematography is to be celebrated. Each shot is sculpted, each movement feels effortless choreographed.Stone has paid huge attention to the incidentals, the minutiae. For such a harsh, brash film there is some wonderful subtly in the periphery of the frame and the seemingly disposable dialogue has barbs that tear. Everything is planned & executed explicitly so that there is occasionally too much to absorb, which can be a relief in a film that is so brutal.The brutality of Savages is numbing from the outset; the opening scene is shocking and horrific despite not being depicted fully for us to endure. This is a violent film in tone far more than in act but don't fool yourself that Savages will be easy on the eyes. It isn't. This is no place for sensitivity and sensitivity is, in fact, murdered in cold blood. Just one more blood splatter in an ocean of claret.The opening voice-over jars initially but is quickly forgiven because Stone, who also co-scripts, takes his time telling the story. Nothing is rushed; time is taken to explain fully. It's not that he thinks we can't keep up, it's that he's determined we should completely understand everything he wants to show and tell. And while he takes over two hours to spill his beans, it's worth investing in every second to enjoy his tale. So, it's a linear affair with few twists or subplots? It's still an accessible, engaging film that is difficult to shake off after the affair.Much of Savages' success is in the casting and performance. Stone has shied away from huge, bankable movie stars that have carried so many of his films, instead favouring recognizable actors who play second-fiddle to the characters. Of the principal three, Taylor-Johnson has earned plaudits in the likes of Nowhere Boy and Kick-Ass and is on his way to stardom; Lively, though he provided solid support in The Town, is better known as the small-screen star of Gossip Girl; and Kitsch is just trying to get by after two of this year's biggest turkeys, John Carter and Battleship.Each if them is watchable, delivering performances that are as entertaining and moving as they are believable, while Hayek chews scenery as a woman you may fantasize about but has serious black widow tendencies. You'd no more mess with her than you would cross Uzis, with Del Toro's Lado, a thug who craves greater acts of sadism and louder screams of agony with every bout of torture he inflicts.Whenever Travolta turns up in a decent film, I can't help feeling he's been thrown a bone by a sympathetic director (look what Tarantino did for him with Pulp Fiction or Terrence Malick with The Thin Red Line) but will inevitably spit it out and go after a foetid rat. With each career rejuvenation he seems to jump straight back into another Battlefield Earth or Michael. Very much a supporting actor here, he's adequate rather then excellent but proves again he's worthy of so much more than another Swordfish.There is an art to compiling a film soundtrack and too often we're blasted with something deeply inappropriate because a record company requires a hit – anyone remember the shocking inclusion of I Love It When You Call in rom-com Good Luck Chuck where the second line, but you never call at all, was cut? Fortunately there are no such travesties in Savages' soundtrack, which is dressed with some fabulous covers including Bruce Lash's take on Psycho Killer and Yuna's Here Comes the Sun.When I asked a member of Cineworld staff if he'd seen Savages yet, he responded ""I haven't seen anything since Ted. I only like comedies."" If you take a similar view, steer clear of Savages; it is most certainly not for you. But if you're looking for something that requires more thought than the second film of my double-bill, Dredd, and has more to it than noise, guns, blood and smashed heads, Oliver Stone might have provided an option.For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",Savages

84,akcenat,A lot of empty flash that never leaves much of an imprint. Terrible.,4,24 July 2020,"In 2020, this poorly made film (from 2012) is having multiple issues. First 15th minutes are so irritating. Though Blake Lively voice may have served a similar narrative function in the novel the film's based on, the voice-over doesn't translate at all to the big screen. Actually, both Blake Lively and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are so uncharacteristic and non-charismatic here, while Kitsch can't compete with all of directors's bombastic camera movements. Most of the cast is miscast (especially almost cartoonish John Travolta and Salma Hayek). It looks Oliver Stone must've been stoned making ""Savages"", because end result is lazy, contrived and cliche ridden plot, what is less than you'd expect from a director of his caliber (Platoon; Salvador; JFK). Film is so polished (read artificial) that everything looks too much scripted and again cliche. Actually, ""Savages"" has terrible acting, dialogues (with cornball stereotypes) and story, but the biggest problem with the movie is complete lack of momentum. It's a 90 min. B-movie stretched out to fit a 144 min. running time. Needless to say, the film is predictable to the point of boring us to death, while the torture scenes are simply without any purpose, not to mention script stupidity in which you get into the business so that you can build wells for starving Africans. Really? Ultimately, ""Savages"" is a work largely content with remaining on the surface of things. Shortly, it's terrible.Rating: 4+",Savages
85,nickmesafilms,Savages (2012) - Why is Oliver Stone Always So Political?,6,29 December 2012,"Oliver Stone directs this 131-minute crime thriller, based on the highly-acclaimed novel of the same name by Don Winslow. Young actors Taylor Kitsch (the idiot from ""Battleship"") and Aaron Johnson, play Chon and Ben, two young men who grow the best marijuana in California, and they both seem to have a noticing, two-timing relationship with a very gorgeous Blake Lively, at the same time. At one point, a Mexican cartel led by Salma Hayek, wants to end up working with these two. After they reject the offer, everything goes haywire after the cartel has decided to kidnap Blake Lively hostage, until they take the deal, but that won't stop these two from trying to rescue her. Sadly, a talented cast isn't enough to make anything terrific from this empty and formulaic thriller. Although decently directed by Oliver Stone, and has a bunch of impressive performances, ""Savages"" is not one of those insanely dark thrillers that I was expecting from the trailer, when instead is a bloated and routine story that kind of bored me for the most part. But there are plenty of positive aspects that make the film worth watching for the most part. The first two acts are somewhat decent, but Oliver Stone delivers his noticeable trademark of dark and graphic violence, gritty sex, and insanely disturbing torture scenes. But the one silver- lining of this movie is provided by three performances, from three professional actors in the supporting cast. First, Salma Hayek delivers an electrifying performance as the cartel leader, mixing her native Spanish language, with the already written English dialouge, making the best out of this material. Second, John Travolta sends off a wickedly funny role as the corrupt DEA agent, with no idea which side to choose. But, of course, Benicio del Toro brings a crazy and psychopathic performance, playing one of the scariest sick-heads to ever roam the planet. Watching these three actors perform on screen is always fun to watch. But as for the main ensemble, filled with the young actors, is nothing engaging. Although I will admit that Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson deliver decent-enough performances, I wasn't impressed with Blake Lively. Although she looked attractive, I bet that that was her only soul purpose. An uninteresting character aside, her delivery in narrating the film seems a bit too distracting, and mostly uncomfortable to listen. Some cheesy writing was involved, and Lively just went way too overboard with the material. Most moments in the plot felt a bit drawn out and unfinished, and there are times when it feels too routine, that you can actually spot the next plot point coming miles away. But what angered most audiences, especially myself, was not only the jumbled third act, but the film's conclusion left a major ""let-down"" to people who were expecting a bloody and intense conclusion, when we end up getting a bland one. Although there are great performances to be had, and some entertaining moments, I expected much more, but I was sadly disappointed! But, overall, for it's many flaws including a cluttered script, uninteresting main characters, and a bland finale, this film works when it succeeds, but fails when it doesn't. ""Savages"", in my review, ""sadly unsatisfying, with forgettable thrills"".",Savages
86,TheMarwood,a watchable trashy film ruined by a terrible ending,5,4 June 2014,"Oliver Stone lets loose his nihilistic side of filmmaking not scene in quite some time and populates his film with pretty faces and soapy, trashy acting. Even with all the gore and torture, there's something playful about Savages. Stone seems happy to be playing in this exploitative, sleazy sandbox, that is until an end that ruins any fun. It's a have your cake and eat it too end, that seems dictated by test screening reactions, where he refused to cut one end and just added another on top of it. It leaves a sour taste to a film that is all surface and no substance and makes the experience frustrating. Well, it was fun until Stone lost his nerve and botched the final minutes.",Savages
87,ragingbull_2005,Stone must be stoned when he made this...,5,5 November 2012,"Never make promises you cannot keep or which your system cannot deliver. Marketing gurus go on and on about this aphorism. Savages, in all of its trailers and the summary, raises hopes of being a revenge drama wherein the two pot growing friends decided to go after the Mexican criminals who have kidnapped their shared girlfriend. Instead it comes across as the latest failure in Oliver Stone's fast growing list of screw ups. The movie despite trying to ""develop"" characters, remains very superficial in its treatment and is even boring in many parts. The acting is average with Travolta being over the top and Del Toro being appropriately revolting. The leads are nothing to write home about. Salma Hayek as the Mafia queen is refreshing in the beginning but then like the movie she also begins getting on your nerves. The editing is very shoddy and the movie is at least half an hour longer than necessary. Expected a really gritty guts and glory tale. This is a big letdown. 2.5 out of 5 for Stone's Savages",Savages
88,Chris_Pandolfi,Stone's Cinematic Plea for Legalization,7,6 July 2012,"Although the convoluted plot, the shocking depictions of violence, and the heavy reliance on dialogue and character all suggest a rich, complicated film, the message of Oliver Stone's ""Savages"" is in fact profoundly fundamental: Marijuana should be legalized. Without anyone directly saying it, we're being told that its demonization by the American government alone has only given more power to drug cartels, specifically in Mexico, which currently dominates the wholesale illicit- drug market and controls 90% of the drugs that enter the United States. We don't actually see kidnapped Mexican men getting decapitated with a chainsaw in a dimly-lit warehouse, but we do see the aftermath; we also see people getting bullets in their brains, stabbings, and even one person being set on fire. We don't have to be told that this is needless and inhuman, but we are made wise to the fact that it stems from drug- related money and territorial disputes, which wouldn't be if certain laws were changed.Adapted from the novel by Don Winslow, the central character is a young woman named Ophelia, who prefers to be known as O (Blake Lively). ""Just because I'm telling this story,"" she says during the opening voice-over narration, ""doesn't mean I'm alive at the end of it."" It seemed like a decent, if ominous, introductory line, although we're hard pressed to understand the logic behind it, even after the film has ended and everything has been explained. Regardless, we watch as her carefree life in Laguna Beach, California is irrevocably altered when she's kidnapped by a Mexican drug cartel under the leadership of Elena Sanchez, locally known as Elena La Reina (Salma Hayek). This came to pass when her two lovers, high school pals and marijuana growers Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch), not only refused to make a business deal with the cartel but also insulted Elena.Although they are friends, Ben and Chon come from completely different places. The former, a business and biology major from UC Berkeley, never went into the marijuana racket for money or power, and he sure as hell doesn't want to kill anyone or even see to it that someone is killed. A pacifist and environmentalist, he actually uses his sizeable profits to fund clean water projects in destitute African villages. The latter, a U.S. Navy SEAL who has served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been trained to be a killer and believes not in ideals but in survival, where you take each individual moment as it comes. The only thing they have in common is their love for O, who they obviously don't mind sharing. Love is precisely the reason they're driven to desperate extremes in their rescue attempt. In ways he never thought possible, Ben will be tarnished by the experience.So will O, who has essentially been living in a privileged fantasy world. I would wager she never really knew the lengths to which cartels can and do go in order to get a point across. She – and, to an extent, Ben and Chon – was comfortably nestled in a fool's paradise this side of the border, sated by a beautiful beachfront house, extravagant shopping sprees, relaxing dinners, and ample supplies of homegrown pot. Her imprisonment is a bizarre series of contradictions: She's chained by the ankles, yet she's provided a bed, a toilet, toothpaste, and food; she's under threat by the ruthless Elena, who in due time reveals her maternal side, prompted by the deaths of several of her children and the scorn of the two that survived, most notably her daughter (Sandra Echeverria). Elena claims that she inherited her late husband's business, although that doesn't account for perpetuating subhuman acts of vengeance. It's about power, and nothing more.As Ben and Chon work towards rescuing O, which involves obtaining very large sums of money in short periods of time, they have encounters with several side characters. One is Elena's right-hand man, Lado (Benicio del Toro), who uses a gardening business as a front for offing people in cold blood. Another is Dennis (John Travolta), a corrupt DEA agent who, in the name of coming off as a big shot, always has to be one step ahead of everyone else. Although he makes it clear that he has two daughters and dying wife, we know that he's in it for no one other than himself. Then there's Spin (Emile Hirsh), who isn't an accountant in the traditional sense of the word but still manages the finances.O's continuous narration gradually reveals a romanticized vision of life around drugs. It doesn't become abundantly clear, however, until the final sequence – or, more accurately, the first part of the final sequence. I honestly don't know how appropriate this part of the movie is; because each revelation yields the same passionate legalization message, it comes off mostly as a cinematic trick, a way for the filmmakers to indulge in pure technique. ""Savages"" is a competently made crime drama with very good performances, although I didn't find it particularly compelling. It inundates us with twists and turns and intentionally disgusts us with horrendous acts of violence, and yet the message it ultimately delivers is so simple that one wonders if Stone needed to go to the lengths he went. That the message directly relates to a hot-button issue is a topic for another day.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Savages
89,eshwarmail,Utterly flawed but undeniably entertaining,6,10 January 2013,"Though the movie falls from one glitch to another leaving trails of unintentional comedy along its way especially the initial voice over from Blake Lively introducing the setup and main characters, but it never stops to entertain thereby accomplishing the sole purpose of its existence. On retrospect, the presentation is stuck on a dilemma whether to go for old school action or modern slickness satisfying neither. Blake Lively never looked more gorgeous in the middle of a preposterous sandwich while one popular face after another make a joke of themselves.Ophelia (Blake Lively) the beautiful Chon (Taylor Kitsch) the muscle and Ben the brains (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) are in a committed threesome relationship heading a professionally organized pot manufacture and distribution network. When Elena (Salma Hayek), a brutal lonely cartel heiress is looking to venture out of territory and plans to acquire their network, the trio has mixed thoughts about the approach. Their plan to trick the cartel by jumping town gets foiled when Ophelia is kidnapped and tortured by Lado (Benicio Del Toro), they are left with no option than to oblige their rules. Ben has one last trick up his sleeve when he turns to Dennis (John Travolta) a dirty corrupt cop for assistance.While Aaron Taylor-Johnson got his look and body language right, his voice still comes out as the nerdy awkward teenager. Though there is enough drama and scenarios created to let you root for the male duo, it is the supporting cast full of popular stars that make this movie work to an extent while the movie jumps from one silly premise to another. The climax is even more messy that the director didn't look like he has made up his mind yet on the conclusion.Utterly flawed but undeniably entertaining.",Savages
90,squirrel_burst,Is a bad ending enough to totally sink a movie? not in my opinion.,8,28 October 2014,"The ending of ""Savages"" nearly sinks the whole movie, but otherwise it's a pretty intense film that's, well I wouldn't say enjoyable considering the story, but good is a decent description. What works is the fact that the movie knows it's about an ugly subject so it doesn't hold back. The story is basically about three friends (Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively and Aaron Johnson) who end up getting in way over their head when they are approached by the Mexican drug cartel.What I liked about the movie is that it's unrelenting in its violence, with brutal scenes of torture and intense, gruesome deaths. There's genuine tension and you are afraid of the Mexican drug cartel when you see to what lengths they will go to in order to intimidate and coerce people into complying with them. It also has a refreshing and honest depiction of the unique relationship between the main characters stuck with me and even though they're drug dealers, I did find that I cared for them. The... unusual relationship that our protagonists have might turn some people off completely from the movie, but you have to applaud it for trying something different and sticking with its bold decisions all the way. Where the movie really doesn't work is the ending, which feels like a studio-mandated conclusion to please squeamish audiences. It's a complete betrayal to the themes and previously seen violence of the film and belongs in an entirely different story. To make it worse, it comes right after a point where the story could (and should) have clearly ended. This is not a Hollywood fairy tale about stoners who get into trouble or wacky hijinks. It's extremely violent and even the toughest audience members may have to look away at some of the more intense scenes but a last-minute addition really undermines the rest of the movie. If you can handle ""Savages"", you'll be (mostly) happy with the way it plays out. (Theatrical Cut on the big screen, September 4, 2012)",Savages

92,ghost_dog86,Is this movie racist?,3,11 July 2012,"To open this review I'm going to ask the question that will undoubtedly be on the minds of many Latino audiences after going to see Oliver Stone's new action film ""Savages"": Who are the savages that the title refers to; the hippie, philanthropist, white drug dealers, or the ruthless, ultra-violent Mexican drug dealers? If you haven't seen the film, keep this question in mind as you read on. ""Savages"", directed by Oliver Stone and horribly adapted from the beloved novel of the same name by Shane Salerno, Don Winslow and Oliver Stone himself, stars Taylor Kitsch (Battleship) and the almost unrecognizable Aaron Johnson (Kick-Ass) as two tanned (but still very white) pot dealers named Chon and Ben respectively, who live in the lap of Laguna Beach, Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) as their love interest O (stupidly short for Ophelia) John Travolta (Pulp Fiction) as the friendly local federal agent, and Benicio Del Toro (Traffic) Selma Hayek (Desperado) and Demian Bichir (A Better Life) as parts of the power-hungry, blood-thirsty, rapist cartel out of Mexico who want to take over Chon and Ben's pot business. Basically the plot is: The good white drug dealers face off against the heartless, evil brown drug dealersand John Travolta. Side Note: Yes, I do understand that there is a half-assed revelation onto who the writers perceive ""the savages"" to be during the final few lines of dialogue in this overly long film, but these few lines have a hard time erasing the two plus hours of the ill-advised, racially driven agenda ""Savages"" serves up over and over again. And I am not saying that the American character making fools out of the ignorant brown skinned character is a stereotype that hasn't been successfully done before (look at almost every Arnold Schwarzenegger movie) but usually not in films that are so insecurely embedded in the exploitative genre. In fact the only good sections of this film are when ""Savages"" does turn into a full-blown exploitive revenge story, tele-novella style. OK, so I understand that maybe with a storyline like this, the white vs. brown aspect could be considered more of a coincidence (aka the Mexican drug dealers happen to be brown and the white drug dealers happen to be American) but ""Savages"" will still rub many people the wrong way with its (maybe misconstrued) cultural depiction of good vs. evil when all is said and done. I'm just saying. Racial undertones aside, there are some major problems with ""Savages"". This is truly an action film as seen through the eyes of Oliver Stone, and so, for much of the film Stone unnecessarily add his visually weird style to scenes which are meant to be straight forward. There are a few points, mostly amidst the violent sequences, when Stone does demonstrate his unique ability to garner a rather strong emotional response out of the audiences, but those moments are few and far between. Also the tone of this film is all wrong. Stone makes this out to be more dramatically driven than the silly, exploitive shoot-em-up that many are expecting. And for that reason, the story suffers immensely. In short, one can tell that within the context of this particular story, Stone is out of his element. In saying all of that, this film does truly live and die on the performance of Blake Lively, playing the central character whom is entrenched in a sexual relationship which may be even too progressive for Californian's. It is just rather unfortunate that Lively's narration throughout is simply awful. Yes, you did not just misread. Not only does this film fall back on the easy way out, storytelling tactic that is voice-over narration, BUT the narration is conducted by none other than the lifeless voice of Blake Lively. Her narration is heard for about 50 percent of this film, but it gets worse, because Lively's horrid skills as an actress (and an orator) are in no way as obnoxious as the character of O that she plays. In the first hour of the film, which centers around O and her sexual exploits with her two lovers, this female character is so poorly written that after only a short while O seems to be more of an annoyance than a love interest or muse. And on top of it all, O is foolishly written to be so stuck up and/or pretty much everything you hate about rich girls from Laguna Beach, that when the film does become a revenge story and Stone asks his audience to root and feel sorry for her as she is taken hostage (not a Spoiler) audiences will undoubtedly find it hard not to wish this abysmally self centered character anything less than a slow painful death. Final Thought: Again ""Savages"" only becomes the slightest bit interesting when it turns into a full on revenge story almost an hour in. Also, I can't forget to mention the fantastic performances from Del Toro and Travolta, who really get to chew the scenery here and may be the only real reasons to watch this film at all. With that said, Travolta isn't nearly in this film enough. As for the B list actors/actresses, the script, which would have worked much better in the hands of a master of stylized dialogue like Quentin Tarantino, fails them miserably, by not only making me replace Kristen Stewart with Blake Lively as the worst actress in Hollywood today, but by also giving Taylor Kitsch the worst one liners since ""John Carter"". In the end, this is not only one of the worst Oliver Stone films I've ever seen, containing one of the worst endings in recent years, but the most racially insensitive movie of the year in a year containing already two Tyler Perry movies.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

93,nesfilmreviews,Disappointing return for Stone.,4,25 November 2014,"Given his past ability to explore complicated issues in compelling fashion, you might expect Oliver Stone to offer up an intriguing look at drug trafficking. Working from the book by Don Winslow — who spent six years researching the DEA and cartels, would give Stone a solid resource from which to draw. A welcomed return to Stone's darker side; ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" and ""World Trade Center"" were almost insultingly faceless, a definite problem for a director whose best films exude righteous anger. Unfortunately, ""Savages"" generates little momentum from its moments of ruthless savagery with far too much downtime in between.California dudes Ben and Chon (Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) are dragged into a turf war with the expansion-minded Mexican cartel run by Salma Hayek's drug-war widow Elena, and her brutally amoral deputy Lado (Benicio del Toro). The Mexicans regularly show their power by creating and disseminating videos documenting torture and a litany of beheadings. Meanwhile, eighty miles over the border in Laguna Beach, Ben and Chon supply their ultra-potent genetically engineered strains to legal medical dispensaries but make their real money illegally shipping out-of- state. The product and its profits fuel the boys' lifestyle of neo-hippie decadence, embodied by the business partners' enthusiastic bedroom sharing of eco-friendly, hippie Ophelia (Blake Lively).The Mexican Baja Cartel decides to move into their turf and demands that the trio partners with them. The merciless head of the cartel, Elena, and her brutal enforcer, Lado, underestimate the unbreakable bond among these friends. Ben and Chon -- with the reluctant, slippery assistance of a dirty DEA agent (John Travolta), wage a seemingly unwinnable war against the cartel. And so begins a series of increasingly vicious ploys and maneuvers in a high stakes, savage battle of wills.Soul is something ""Savages"" sorely lacks and it feels inherently hollow. The screenplay (co-written by Stone) is a bit of mess, sloppily assembling a wide range of characters. One of serious issues with the movie usually occurs when the film's three young leads occupy the screen. Though they're competent, Taylor Kitsch, Blake Lively, and Aaron Johnson are hardly scintillating. Their performances fail in comparison to the completely outrageous performances delivered by Benicio Del Toro, Salma Hayek, and John Travolta. Plus, the young threesome and their love triangle never convincingly seduce the audience. ""Savages"" is a waste of Stone's time as he falls back on old habits of mayhem and provocation best left in the past.",Savages
94,Tcarts76,Poorly written and Directed. Good actors can't salvage savages.,5,1 November 2012,"The story of this one is fairly decent. Two marijuana growers from SoCal, Chon (Taylor Kitsch) a former Navy seal and Ben (Aaron Johnson) a SoCal Buddhist hippie, get a deal from a Mexican drug cartel run by Elena (Salma Hayek) that they agree to but decide to escape the country and disappear. Elena has their shared girlfriend, dumb blonde California girl Ophelia (Blake Lively) who goes by the equally stupid name O. In order to get her back they must jump through some hoops and agree to terms. The guys decide that they will take things into their own hands and savage violence ensues.The Good: The story is interesting and solid, at least from a reading it stand point, although it's a tough sale for me, living in Southern California, that with our liberal medical marijuana laws, that anyone smart, growing to sell at collectives would actually get involved in this crap. Salma Hayek is a solid star in this one and is really the only one to give a solid performance. The visuals of the beach and a somewhat decadent lifestyle are definitely a good distraction. Blake Lively is a beautiful girl. Yes, she is in this movie, but her character is so dumb that she really loses her attractiveness, and I don't mean in a bubbly blonde way.The Bad: The writing and directing is horrible, truly bad. ,I at first just thought the acting was horrible, but given the complete cast, I soon realized that as not good as the acting was, the only blame should fall on Oliver Stone himself. First, this movie didn't seem to ever find any kind of coherent style. At times it looks and sounds like it is trying to copy a sort of Quinten Tarantino like violent and crude movie, with some humor but that fell completely flat. At other times it promised to become a more action packed thriller but that too was just a tease.Also having Blake Lively narrate this movie was an epic fail. Combined with the bad writing it comes off as a pretty, stupid girl telling a fourth grade story with the intelligence of a potato, and the vocabulary to match. Her voice is just not voice-over worthy. Just take one line from this movie, ""I had orgasms, he had wargasms."" yeah, was about the depth of thought involved in this movie.I must also interject that Mr.Stone has probably never met a Navy Seal in his life. OK, maybe Jessie Ventura. His character that is suppose to be an ex-Seal comes off as a adolescent teenage thug, who couldn't find his way out of a paper bag.In the end I think Oliver Stone has been to wrapped up in his lovefests with Cuban and South American Dictators, and maybe smoking too much marijuana to actually put out a decent, smart movie. Watching this one kind of made me feel sad for Mr.Stone, and miss the days when he put out good movies like ""Natural Born Killers."" (1994) I truly was hoping for a great movie when I saw the previews for this one but I was definitely disappointed. It kind of reminded me of that movie ""Redline"" (2007), remember that one? Yeah. Nobody else does either.So for really bad writing, directing, not having any kind of coherent style, and not quite fulfilling its action and ""savagery"" that it promised, the best I can give this one is a 5 out of 10, and that may truly be kind and is out of respect to Salma Hayek who shouldered this movie pretty much on her own, although Del Toro had a few tiny moments.Like my review?

95,perkypops,How not to cast a film or write a script.....,2,28 July 2013,"The story line is inventive. It even contains novelty value. The sound track is as good as the cinematography and the director and crew do all they can. So why does this film suck? Well, the script is too often banal, so banal, the poorly casted leads just don't appear to know what they are doing. Occasionally the editing is poor, so the storyline doesn't move along as it should, and so we get some narrative, which is, frankly, diabolical. Oh, and the voicing of it makes it frighteningly awful.The three main characters in this film O., Ben and Chon, are not acted, they are the actors pocketing a large amount of money for doing absolutely nothing. They probably don't ever understand what is going on except for when they are being out acted in huge distances by some of the real actors in the film. Can the leads actually act?Meanwhile the script is full of the most awful touches of ""obvious"" even when the real actors make the words unnecessary. Subtle, and intelligent are not things the script contains, which is a pity because the story is worthy of better.The film is supposed to have a nasty streak - Savages, get it? - but it is just too unpleasant to be nasty except when actors are acting nasty and you have to be able to act to do that, and Lado (Del Toro), Dennis (Travolta) and Lena (Hayek) manage it pretty well. In the meantime the leads kind of change clothes or something to make it look like they are doing something different but they cannot act! So why were the feckless threesome leads let anywhere near it. Perhaps the producers could make a film about that instead.Interesting for the real actors but spoilt by the rest.",Savages

Both del Toro and Travolta were both at their best here, their scenes were excellent, both gave a wonderful performance and really brought their characters to life. Benicio del Toro plays Lado, a psychotic enforcer for a Mexican drug cartel run by a truly lovely Salma Hayek who also gives a great performance as a basically unhappy woman who had lost her husband and her twin sons. Her other son and only daughter are distanced from her, her son angry that he did not inherit the business and her daughter, the only truly decent person in the whole movie is ashamed of what her mother does for a living.These actors were the high note of the film, the low being Blake Lively as Ophelia Sage or as O as she liked to call herself.Taylor Kitsch as Chon and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Ben, O's two boyfriends all living in a ménage à trois are marijuana growers living in Laguna Beach. Chon, a Navy Seal and veteran of Afghanistan brought back Marijuana seeds for his best friend Ben, a business graduate and botanist to cultivate making them both quite wealthy.Things are fine until they receive a video showing several severed heads and a chainsaw along with a demand for a meeting.That is when their idyllic lives are completely disrupted. Elena Sánchez (Salma Hayek) wants not only their business, but the two men as well. Even though they offer the business to her, she wants them to stay simply because their product is so good and she needs their expertise. She also needs a foothold in America because she is losing all her political connections in Mexico.When they refuse, Elena has O kidnapped and that is when it all hits the fan.This should have been a great movie, and it could have been except for Blake Lively's annoying performance. Her character was a moron who seemed oblivious to everything around her. Instead of picking up that they were in serious danger, (hell you would think the video would have tipped her off) she chooses to go out to dinner and go shopping. Talk about being handed the idiot ball. Also her narration was a mistake. The whole stoner, 'omigod I am so wasted' thing wore pretty thin pretty fast. I mean 'wargasims' seriously? Pity as it was a good role that could have brought something to the film, but it was wasted. I can't help but think what a good actress like a young Jodi Foster or Maggie Gyllenhaal could have done with this role.The two male leads were not quite as bad but they were completely overshadowed and outclassed by del Toro and Travolta. Although they did have a couple of good moments just not enough to really hold interest.The movie is only saved by Hayek, del Toro and Travolta. Seriously, they are the only reasons to sit through this.Magda (Sandra Echeverria)who plays Elena's estranged daughter puts in a fine performance and it is a pity she did not have a bigger role. To be honest, she is the only likable character in the whole film. O is too much of a rich spoilt stoner dimwit to like, Chon is a downright nasty piece of work and just as bad in his own way as Lado. Ben is sweet, but whiny and ineffectual.Kudos to Diego Cataño as Estéban, another secondary character way more interesting and sympathetic than the three leads.Elena also brings some sympathy and her fate at the end of the film makes you feel bad for her. But she is a bad person who does evil things. The torture scene makes you realize this, although her one saving grace is her love for her daughter. It actually makes her more than a one dimensional character.Lado is a joy though, he is a nasty, crazy violent man who seems to take delight in torture. He rapes O as punishment for going over his head to Elena and when he shows her the video of it, she spits on his face. He calmly wipes the spit on his fingers, licks it off then uses her hair to wipe his face clean. Man that is cold. What he does to Alex (Demián Bichir), (who Chon and Ben framed, by the way, these are the guys we are supposed to be cheering for.) is ugly. He is also an abusive husband, His poor wife, Dolores in a great performance by Mía Maestro just wants out but he threatens to take their two sons and daughter to Mexico so she can never see them again.Dennis Cain (John Travolta) plays the corrupt DEA agent whose wife is dying leaving him to raise two little girls on his own. You feel a little more sympathy for him when you see him sitting talking to his terminally ill wife. The scene with him and Lado is probably the high point of the film. It's nice seeing these two talented actors together.Overall, the film could have been better with a stronger female lead and a couple of male leads that you could like and cheer for. Sadly I was left not caring what happened to any of them.Also the fake ending was stupid, pointless and took away from the film. Have the ending you wanted to have, don't give us a fake ending, then a real ending. It really ruined the film for me.All up, not one of Oliver Stone's better efforts. I can't help but wonder if I would have like the film if the leads had been more likable. I am not sure but it is a good film if you like violent action movies about drug cartels.",Savages

The acting is poor, the dialogue scenes are so long and boring. The story is all over the place, young carefree hippy type drug lords with army backgrounds and conveniently, army weapons?

This time he pretends to make a serious film about Mexican drug dealers but does a fantasy thriller, aimed at stoned (no pun intended) young audience. This is simplistic, naive stuff, far from the complex reality of Mexican drug cartels and ""weed growing"". For example the Mexicans in the film talk to each other in English, even when the conversation is in Tijuana between a Mexican man and a Mexican woman, both born and raised in Mexico. Ridiculous. And how ridiculous was that the special forces friends of one of our two heroes, who served with him in Afghanistan and Irak, participate in the action against drug traffickers, using the US Army equipment and all, violating the US Army regulations and codes. But I guess that is what good friends are for, right? Idiotic. Etc, etc. And also, they should stop saying this film is so out there in terms of violence, because it is not. Not by today's standards. I think I saw even some cable TV episodes that were more violent than this, not to mention dozens of films. The film looks very pretty, with good colors and photography, the soundtrack is interesting and Salma is good. Other than that a disappointment.",Savages

101,dmuel,menage a trois in dope world,6,13 July 2012,"Oliver Stone gives us a new story, mostly free of political controversy, about 3 young people, two men one girl, who live intimately together in a sexual menage a trois, and who happen to be vendors of the best marijuana in the world. Trouble comes as Mexican drug cartels seek to muscle-in on their otherwise idyllic southern California lifestyle. The story is told from the viewpoint of the woman, named simply ""O"", who tells of her love for both men. Bully for her! But an odd absence of sexual jealousy pervades the relationship between the two young men, one an ivy-league scholar, the other a Navy Seal, the first the brains, the latter the brawn and bravado. Intense violence permeates the film, a very realistic aspect to an otherwise difficult-to-swallow story about happy, rich young pot-dealers who collide with the bad side of the drug world. Tisch and Johnson, the two males, manage their roles without too much difficulty, and Blake Lively, the girl, does OK as the narrator, though all three characters are drawn without much depth. Their relationships are presented as fact which the viewer is required to accept, but not with convincing effect. The best acting comes from Benito Del Toro as the menacing, murderous psychopath who enforces the orders of Salma Hayek, the drug cartel's ruling queen. The film makes an effort to delineate between the hippy-like dream of being peaceful, benevolent pot smokers with the reality of the violence that marks the contemporary world of drug trafficking...with marginal success. The problem is the viewer ends up having little interest in the fates of these unlikely characters; more pulp fiction than art.",Savages

The film wanders around Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente, so it's easy on the eyes, but not much is actually going on.

103,jaxbubba,"We seen this all before, and done so much better!!!",4,22 July 2012,"""Savages"" is Oliver Stones' latest and greatest drug cartel epic. The film has an all-star cast featuring the likes of Benicio Del Toro (Lado), Blake Lively (O), Taylor Kitsch (Chon), Aaron Johnson (Ben), and John Travolta (Dennis). The issue at hand is this film has every drug cartel cliché from every other drug cartel movie rehashed in this film, and it's not done well.Chon and Ben are best buds, and during a brainstorming session on the beach one afternoon, they decide to start a small (but profitable) marijuana distribution franchise. Ben majored in biochemistry as able to produce a higher quality product, while Chon (being in the military at the time) was able to smuggle Afghanistan seeds into the US. In less than three years, they had a superior product on the market, and the attention of the larger cartels on the street. The two friends have only one love in their life (in which they share), and that is O (Blake Lively). When the drug cartel makes them an offer that they cannot refuse (but they do anyway), O is kidnapped to ensure that the guys do as they are told.There are lots of issues with this film. The first being that the drug cartel is being run by Elena (Salma Hayek). She tries to be a hard ass; however, she comes across as weak and not very intimidating enough for my needs (though she tries really, really hard). Benicio Del Toro tries to play the enforcer, and Elena's muscle; however, I believed that he would have made a much better drug cartel kingpin. Our two heroes, Chon and Ben seem to be a couple of lovesick teenage, surfer dudes who really need to grow a pair!!! And I really do not know of any two guys who would really consent to his best friend banging his girlfriend, just a little to weird for me to comprehend.The ending was really the pinnacle of badness an ending shown, and you go ""OMG, really??? After two hours of watching this film, this is how the film will end?"" Then the narrator comes in with an alternate ending. And I was like, no. of the two choices, let's go with the first one. LOL!!!! Again, Oliver Stone brings nothing new or original to this film; and it's basically two hours of every drug movie cliché in the book. You have seen this movie before, numerous times, and done way better. I cannot recommend this film, unless you are really interested in seeing Blake Lively getting banged by two different guys, and that occurs within the first 15 minutes of the film. So wait for this one to show on STARZ, HBO, etc and save your money!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL""",Savages
104,Simon_Says_Movies,How Savage Would You Become?,7,15 September 2012,"To defeat a savage, how savage would you become? Would you become the bogeymen to punish those who haunt your dreams? In narcotics thriller Savages, director Oliver Stone presents and then answers those questions in vivid, graphic detail while exploring a facet of love that is far from fairy tale. The setup to Savages adds a spark to this rather familiar material with our protagonists committing to the type of love triangle you'll never see in a romantic comedy. Having all met years earlier on the shores of Laguna Beach, Cal., what began as a pot-dealing partnership between pacifist botanist Ben (Aaron Johnson), damaged war vet Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and their employee Ophelia ""O"" (Blake Lively) became a friendship and eventually something more. Sharing their multi-million- dollar ocean-front home, these three love one another and exist more as kindred spirits than players in some sort of lustful, dysfunctional tryst. We believe in this arrangement, so when O is abducted by the cartel after a failed business proposal, we are invested in their cause. The only weak link in this violent parable is the casting of O herself, as Blake Lively comes off more adorable than as some sort of goddess. Jennifer Lawrence was originally cast as O, and while she's no bubbling sexpot herself, she would have been a boundlessly superior choice to the often clunky presence of Lively. The film is also stricken by an insufferable and unnecessary voice-over by our lead vixen that detracts from the narrative and hints from the get-go that Stone has something up his sleeve. But overall, the acting is extremely strong with more characters receiving some depth than you would usually get in a narco-thriller. Taylor Kitsch rinses some of the stink of John Carter and Battleship from his soiled reputation and Aaron Johnson is far from the awkward teen we saw in Kick-Ass. John Travolta makes a limited but memorable appearance as a corrupt DEA agent and his scenes with Chon and Ben are the movie's bursts of comedic relief. The ""good guys"" split screen time surprisingly equally with the other side of the conflict featuring the cartel head Elena (Salma Hayek) and her chief enforcer Lado (Benicio Del Toro). It is without question Del Toro who absconds with the entire affair as the loathsome Lado, who is so sinister and revolting every time he appears on screen you truly fear he is about to slaughter somebody. He is in fact so vile and so disturbingly charismatic that you even dread what he may do to the other antagonists. He is involved in nearly every instance of the film's grisly violence and his participation in a particularly graphic whipping scene only cements his on-screen reputation. With his dishevelled moustache and hallowed eyes, he makes Lado infinitely memorable and provides what is easily one of the very best performances of his career. This is Stone's most accomplished work since 2006's World Trade Center, and while that effort was more a showcase for some surprisingly potent acting by Nicolas Cage and Maria Bello, Savages is very much an exhibition of Stone's sure-handed action direction and distinct style – love it or hate it. Despite being sold more as an action thriller, the gunplay is sparser than I would have thought and is far more a character study with perforations of violence. This is at times a detriment, especially considering Savages runs about 20 minutes too long. Stone might have considered approaching the material a tad more like a stripped-down revenge tale, even though we see far too many films of that variety each year. Stone is at his most interesting when he brings up issues of morality and the three-way relationship between O, Chon and Ben. The best example of this comes when our captured belle sits down to dinner with our sultry Elena at which she points out that Chon and Ben must love each other more than her or else they would never be able to share. Many elements of Savages could easily become its own film: a deeper exploration of the love triangle, a look at the assent and tragedies of the Elena character and even more so the rise of Lado, whose arc here resolves nothing like you would expect. Speaking of resolutions, be prepared for a love-it-or-hate-it climax that interestingly plays with conventions of the genre while existing as a cheat to the audience in turn. I found the finale to be more of a moot series of events in relation to the mostly strong (if meandering) film that preceded it, but I do realize if Stone had just gone for the against-type conclusion some viewers would be just as put off, if for slightly different reasons. Judge it for yourself. All those who populate Stone's world have their savage qualities, be it through a forced hand or due to gleaning some twisted pleasure. Lively's ethereal O has a different meaning for the word, one far more fitting for her ""wrong"" love story: being savage merely represents living an existence in the untamed – a reversal back to the feral and unpolished. If this is Stone in a savage state of any kind, then I suggest he remain in it, as for whatever it's worth, this is his return to form.",Savages
105,cadillac20,"Entertaining, If A Bit Lackluster",6,6 July 2012,"Oh, Oliver Stone. There was a time when Stone was a gigantic name in cinema. When a Stone movie came out, you knew what your were getting. But in the past several years since Any Given Sunday, things have changed. Where a new Stone film was something of an event, Stone being one of only a couple handfuls of directors who were really recognized in major cinemas, now we get films from the director that are fairly forgettable. Alexander, World Trade Center, W., Wall Street 2. These films all have one thing in common: mediocrity. Sadly, Savages can get added to that list. Now don't get me wrong, it's an entertaining film, but it's also wholly forgettable.Firstly, I will say that Stone is still a master of the craft. Savages is directed with purpose and Stone brings out the best in his actors. But it's the story he's working with that never really shines. The film feels a bit slow. There's never any real tension involved, even if it isn't all that predictable. When we expect that there should be more action, the film barely has any. When we expect that we should anticipate more envelope pushing, the film shy's away. Where I expected to wince, grip the edge of my seat, and wait in anticipation of the next event, I found myself somewhat lulled by the lack of anticipation and tension. It really just does not exist, which is sad, because this is a film that had a lot of potential to be very exciting.Now, I realize this is based on a novel, and having not read it, it's possible the film plays out the way the novel does. And we certainly get some great scenes and actors out of this. Our leads are likable, particularly Ben. Yes, they're criminals, but you never really feel like they're trying to do any real evil. In fact, Ben is such a likable guy that when you see what he inevitably has to do, you don't want him to make those choices, even when he has to make them. Chon is played almost polar opposite, and it works just as well. Even though he's cold and brutal, he's still likable in his loyalty to his friends and his realism. He's not the nice guy Ben is, but he's definitely the second half you know both Ben and O need. I'll get to O in a minute, but both Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch, two of the three youngest of the cast do a respectable job in their characters and are enjoyable to watch as they feel like a real family, much less friends. The rest of the cast bring their A game, with Travolta playing a dirty cop and Benecio Del Toro playing up his brutal, yet laid back enforcer. However, the truly shining star here is Salma Hayek, who gets the best character. Hayek's Elena is the most well rounded character, showing the sides of a brutal crime lord, a woman who still seems like she needs to prove herself while being surrounded by men, and a vulnerable mother who both wants a relationship with her estranged daughter, yet is proud to see her shun the family business and build a life of her own. It's a complicated role and Hayek excels in it.This brings me to the one, glaring issue: O. Now, I like this character to an extent. As played by Blake Lively, she is a great anchor between the two lead males. However, she plays the character so inconsistently that I couldn't really get behind her. For one thing, throughout the entire film, we had to listen to her monologue and voice over the events going on. I don't mind a little narration here and there, but there's far too much and none of it is all that fantastically written. O is also an inconsistent character. She seems fairly level and grounded early on, but once she's kidnapped, we find her a whiny, rich brat making demands. She also seems to accept her situation a little too graciously. Of course, she's also treated with quite a bit of hospitality. Now, I don't know what other people's idea of the Mexican Cartel is, but the civility demonstrated here is not nearly as brutal or frightening as I'd expect it to be, especially in a film called Savages.Of course, the worst criminal here is the story. Now, throughout it's decent. It's entertaining and there are a few, scattered exciting moments, but for the most part, it lacks tension or suspense. This is a film about the Mexican Cartel. The Cartel is one of the most ruthless criminal organizations operating on the continent today. And yet, I never truly felt our characters were in real danger. I was never entirely that scared for them and even Del Toro, who is certainly intimidating, comes off as vulnerable. I like Chon and Ben, but I don't really buy that they would have the kind of sway they had with the Cartel and I feel like there could have been a lot more tension involved here. There's also one massive issue in the final 15-10 minutes. I won't spoil it here, but suffice to say, it's a massive eye roller and it really does sour the entire experience a bit. It's not the deal breaker I think a lot of people have made it to be, but it is fairly glaring and really unnecessary.",Savages

109,JankiSharma,nicely done,8,8 July 2012,"After a long time I thoroughly enjoyed Oliver Stone's directed movie Savages (enjoyed natural born killers,Born on the 4th , walls street). The movie Savages centers around two best friends Ben ( Aaron Johnson : Albert Nobbs)and Chon (sounds like John (taylor Kitsch)) with different personalities. Aaron, a Botany major, polite, nice,likes peace and does things legally. Chon, on the other hand, back from Iraq with lots of emotions locked in, stoic, ready to kill. Both Ben and Chon start marijuana business in CA and Ben does everything to keep weed operation clean with the help of Dennis (John Travolta),DEA agent. Both Ben and Chon enjoy a beautiful relationship with the beautiful O (Blake Lively). All 3 have a very healthy togetherness. Now the Mexicans want to work with Ben and Chon and want to use their techniques of growing best pot. Ben and Chon are reluctant to join hands with Mexicans and O is kidnapped by Mexicans headed by Elena (Salma Hayek) and her employee Lado ( Benicio Del Toro : Traffic). To release O from their clutches, Ben and Chon have to deliver 300 pounds of marijuana. One of my favorite scenes is when Ben is driving the car packed with pot and Chon is front seat passenger. There is a state trooper and Ben hopes they don't get stopped for speeding. Chon , on the other hand, stays cool and tells Ben that it was going to be OK because he has his gun ready to kill the cop. Differences in their personalities are shown very well. Ben prays , not for his life, not for Chon but for the state trooper. Because Ben knows Chon very well. Chon is action man. Chon takes care of Ben . Chon defends Ben and both Ben and Chon are on a mission to save O. Aaron Johnson as Ben is terrific and Taylor Kitsch as Chon is excellent. And just like O says, both Ben and Chon are great and make the movie terrific. Blake Lively is lovely. Benicio Del Toro as cruel Lado is very good. Salma Hayek is her usual self.

110,dharmendrasingh,This is why they should legalise drugs,7,29 September 2012,"'Savages', a high-octane, drug-fuelled revenge story, is another high-calibre addition to Oliver Stone's remarkable repertoire. It has the verve – dare I say it – of a younger filmmaker, but the hallmarks are undoubtedly those of a veteran. Taylor Kitsch ('John Carter'), who needs this role more than it needs him, and 'Nowhere Boy's' Aaron Johnson play marijuana makers Chon and Ben. They share a girlfriend, O (Blake Lively), who defends the love triangle by saying the same thing the great singer Morrissey said, 'You love one person, so why can't you love two?'. Ex-soldier Chon is the manlier of the two and gives O 'wargasms'. Ben is the proverbial lover. Money isn't his sole motivation. Practising Buddhism and playing with the disadvantaged kids some of his drug money goes to is more his cup of ganja. Ben's botany degree assists him to grow unique specimens, which fetch high prices, and it's not long before their operation goes national. But their rise does not go unnoticed. Salma Hayek plays Elena, an outrageously sexy martinet, who controls a Mexican drug cartel looking to consolidate its future by monopolising the market. That means usurping 'indie' businesses like Chon and Ben's, by any means necessary. It's fairly obvious that O will be Elena's ransom; less obvious is how she is rescued by her quixotic lovers. Oliver Stone, who co-wrote the screenplay with Don Winslow, upon whose eponymous 2010 book the film is based, throws in just enough asides and misdirection to keep us engaged. Elena's number one henchman is the mullet-topped Lado (Benicio Del Toro), who is so despicable he licks O's saliva when she spits on him. Lado is one of those hard to forget baddies. He issues threats passive-aggressively through his teeth in a superb Mexican accent, and likes to record his rapes. Man, he's creepy. John Travolta completely assumes his pivotal role as Dennis, the bent Federal Agent, who would sell his mother without batting an eyelid.What took the glint off an otherwise rip-roaring film was the disappointing double-ending. Ironically, the dream ending would have been fine because films about drugs shouldn't have happy endings. www.moseleyb13.com",Savages
111,mbs,entertaining enough to be worth watching but the 2 guys were like cardboard and i hate to say it but Blake Lively is terrible in it .,6,23 August 2012,"It was OK enough---it was definitely well directed--but the film would've benefited a lot from three better actors in the central roles. Don't get me wrong--its not that Taylor Kitch or Aaron Johnson aren't decent enough--both play their roles with exactly the same kind of stiffness that i guess suit their characters' circumstance but neither really add anything beyond what the screenplay has already provided them.. like if this were made say 10-15 years ago and you'd of had Steve Zhan and Ben Affleck in it i'm not saying it would've been batter but the two of them would've made you care for what might happen to the main characters a bit more i feel like. I'd rather not get into the lack of any kind of convincing emoting from Blake Lively here--- (She's supposed to be afraid for her life here--and somehow its like she's barely miffed---its as if instead of her life that's being threatened its her wi-fi connection.) having read the book this was based on--the character O in the story was a lot more resourceful and a lot more crazy then Blake Lively ever suggests in the two hours of running time---would that they had cast literally anybody else in her part,just off the top of my head would Lauren Ambrose from six feet under have been considered too old??? would Krysten Ritter??? would Kirsten Bell?? hell Alexis Bidel might of been able to pull this off better (and as much as i love Rory Gilmore emoting was never exactly her strong suit) at least Blake Lively's narrating was OK...i just really wish they could've found someone who could have really put this movie over the top here. God again if this was made like 10-15 years ago--imagine what a younger Juliette Lewis or a younger Illeana Douglas could've done with this.That's really all i actually wanted to say cause everything else was fine enough--i was kind of expecting it to be more over the top if anything given that its Oliver St one's first crime film in a little while but its definitely over the top enough to satisfy anyone looking for an over the top crime movie.

112,evans-j34,a let down,4,13 May 2014,This film wasn't what I hoped it probably could a been decent its got plenty of good actors who all do they're parts well... Salma hayek plays her part of strong woman boss cartel well and so does her head hench man.. Unfortunately Blake lively irrates the hell out of me in this movie.. I've never been her greatest fan tbh but she's never bothered so much either way but in this her drone talk moaning voice is winey and annoying.. After being kidnapped by Mexican ganglords she actually requests to be supplied as their prisoner with internet and free reefa.. I mean seriously as if that would happen..

So I sat down to enjoy this... but apart from the cliche violence the story was dire. The dialogue bland and the outcome awful. The ending was a Bobby Ewing cliche. I put a lot of time into watching this but the story was woeful. Dull, boring and unimaginative. No intelligent design and no clever ending.These drug cartel stories are so worn out and overplayed. I'm bored with unimaginative story writers. The baddies doing gruesome things. Yeah. I've seen it all before. Do something different! But nope, they didn't.This film bored me. It had potential but just droned on and couldn't be bothered with a good ending. Everything is in place apart from the story. Very disappointed. I recommended it only because of the cast.

115,Treyroo,Visually stunning but dull otherwise,6,6 December 2012,"Can two men share a woman and stay friends? Can a small, independent group of marijuana dealers take on a Mexican cartel? Has Oliver Stone lost his touch?We are given a brief history of two of the lead characters, Ben and Chon (played by Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) by their girlfriend and the film's narrator O (short for Ophelia, played by Blake Lively). Ben (Johnson) is a college graduate who majored in business and botany. Chon (Kitsch) is a veteran who returned from Afghanistan with the seeds that became an extremely potent form of marijuana and the foundation of their successful business. Ben contributes a great deal of his income to worthy causes and travels extensively. While he's away, O and Chon receive a video containing numerous severed heads and chainsaw. They fear Ben has been killed until he returns home a short time later. They had a scheduled meeting with the cartel and so, they go ahead with it. The cartel representatives propose that Ben and Chon join their organization, but rather than consider their offer, they say they take the time they've been given to consider it and make plans to flee the country. A DEA agent named Dennis (played by John Travolta) tells them that the partnership is the best option. They disagree but, before they can leave the country, O is kidnapped. Ben and Chon hear this directly from Elena Sanchez, the leader of the cartel who ordered it. Elena (played by Salma Hayek) tells the two men that she intends to hold O hostage until they honor the terms of their agreement. During that time, she's held prisoner amid miserable surroundings and guarded by a cartel henchman who goes by Lado (played by Benicio del Toro). Now, regardless of what anyone might say about its historical accuracy, or lack thereof, I greatly enjoyed JFK. Same goes for Wall Street, Nixon, The Doors and Born on the Fourth of July. I thought Any Given Sunday was alright, but nowhere near as good as the others I've mentioned. I don't know if this movie's failure is something to be blamed on Stone, the actors or the source material, but the story didn't really go anywhere and the characters were completely unrealistic. I'm not saying I won't watch it again, but I certainly won't pay for the opportunity.",Savages
116,SimonD1900,Horribly bad,3,26 September 2020,"Can't almost not believe that the creator of Natural Born killers and Born The Forth Of July could make something that comes of this uninspired.Although I would understand that some people would really like this. And that's okey, I guess. When I was thirteen I probably would have liked it too, thinking it was really cool.But as I watched this last night, not being thirteen, I have to say it just felt like a bunch of nonsense. I actually mounded a couple of time over how bad it was.Were to start? Well, I don't like the story, it's not interesting in anyway, at least not the way it's told here. It could perhaps had been interesting if made in a completely other way. The idea that two guys who grow their own strains of cannabis would get in trouble with higher up criminals could be a fun movie. Also the threesome relationship could be interesting. But all of that gives nothing here. I just don't care about the lead characters because they don't feel real. But how come? How did the movie fail to make me care?The movies biggest problem is that it tries so hard to look like a fashion commercial in every scene. I suppose Stone wanted to make a stylish movie, but to me, the style is just wrong here, it feels like a music video and that takes away from the actual grim aspects that the story actually posses and makes it feel unreal. And the dialogue is cringe worthy, just comes of so corny all the time. If all a movie wants is to be ""cool,"" like this movie clearly wants to be, the dialogue is utterly importent for that to succeed. And this movie isn't cool to me, it's just corny.I also don't understand why it had to be so heavily narrated trough out, it's not like it's very complex to understand or follow without it, completely unnecessary. Also that it's over 2 hours is also completely unnecessary.I have to admit one thing though, Blake Lively looks really good in this movie, I mean, like hot, but that's not enough to redeem a whole movie, actually its not redeemable at all for a movie, you can't base a whole movie on that, but it probably is the best part of the movie anyway. Lively actually also pulls of a pretty good performance to be honest, better then the other of the two leads anyway. The two lead guys, don't remember their names, are just not that good, they look more like models that worries more about if they look good or not, but acting? Not so much. They just didn't feel believable, really shallow and boring performances.Salma Hayek's character is probably the most interesting character in the movie, even if you don't get to know that much about her but the character is interesting, you understand that she got layers and you wonder how she would come to power in such man dominated world, I only got really irritated when the she makes a huge idiot mistake and lets Benicio Del Toros character live after he clearly proved he didn't respect her, but Hayek does the role okey anyway besides that. Benicio Del Toro has a kind of a fun role here, as a real psycho, but still on the low end of his career I think, he has have much better parts. John Travolta plays his character in a kind of hilarious way, overacting a bit but its kind of works I guess actually, also he had better parts. But all these characters are way more interesting then the utterly boring two leads.And then to the horrible ending. Yeah, a shoot-out off course, that's the only way you can end a movie right? Well, sure a shoot-out can definitely work, if it's done good, like in Pineapple Express for example and that's a comedy and I understand this is not? I didn't laugh once anyway, not even a smirk. Anyway this is the most ridiculous shoot-out ever; trained snipers, that get talked up during the entire movie over how professional, stone cold and precise killers they are, misses again and again on open targets only a couple of meters away. And they also had no idea that just in front of them was a bunch of armed hostile the whole time, hiding in some grass, before the shoot-out started, didn't notice? Didn't think about checking out the possibilitie of that perhaps? Busy checking your Instagram instead? Just so ridiculous. Then the worst crime of it all, the director can't chose what ending he wants so he puts two different ones in. Totalt unnecessary, pick a ending and stick with that. Don't waste my time. I don't care how many different ways it could have gone down, I can figure that out myself, I mean seriously? Seriously? If you don't know what movie you want to make, maybe not make a movie. And if you thought that was something that would get some kind of emotional reaction from viewers, like they would go ""oh no! no! no! I can't believe... Oh wait, oh oh oh, what a relief... haha first I thought for a second..."" That's actually just stupid, do you assume your audience is stupid?Sorry, I'm going of a bit here, I just get irritated when I waste two and a half hours on stupid, corny bull crap of a movie.I'll give 3 points for Blake Lively's charms and Benicio Del Toros crazy character that I do think he had fun playing at least.

118,Cinnyaste,"One Quarter Stone, Three Quarters Bullshit",4,6 July 2012,"In Mr. Stone's ""Platoon,"" brutal, direct Barnes and mellow, intelligent Elias battle for Charlie Sheen's mortal soul. Whether familiar or pet, Mr. Stone plumbs the theme again in ""Savages."" Unfortunately ""Savages"" glides into a land far, far away from ""Platoon.""The predominate feeling from ""Savages"" is it was about a Hollywood deal. Mr. Stone not only phoned in a (co-telephoned) script but the direction as well. His renowned editorial and textural format tricks fail to enhance the storytelling as in ""Natural Born Killers."" Here, they are plugged in to assuage any fears ""Savages"" might not be a Stone film. Casting adds to the feel-of-the-deal. Bluntly, Ms. Lively would never exit a paper bag were she to depend upon her acting to do so. Kitsch and Johnson are directly behind her. Mr. Travolta chews the scenery like he's in a high school production supporting role. Ms Hayek, at least, turns in a good performance.Given the 24 Hour news cycle's coverage of the Mexican-American drug war, it's difficult to dramatize an inherently insane subject. Little effort is needed to find chilling video of men hanging upside down like a side of beef being castrated with a dull knife. The corruption greasing the drug distribution wheels as they travel to El Norte is also common knowledge. That leaves the need for a personal story about these purveyors, or at least a new slant (save a female Cartel leader). All that is missing in the pulpy and broad ""Savages.""On the Pulp: early on it's clear the typically amazing Mr. Del Toro's performance is derived from Silent's mustachioed villains. Later he actually twirls his mustache. At this point there was an expectation, ""Nyah-Ha-Ha,"" would pass his lips.The ""Savages"" cast and Mr. Stone recently sat for an interview on PBS' ""Charlie Rose."" The usually garrulous Mr Stone said nary a word about this story, which, in case you're interested, goes something like this: a female-led Cartel, losing money, sets out to swallow smaller players, including one growing 'Primo'. The business is high-tech and run by two high school buddies: a tough physically and emotionally scarred Ex-SEAL (Barnes) who served in the Middle East and a granola-eating college boy (Dual Major - Botany and Business) who wants to save the world (Elias). The woman they share is kidnapped when Butch and Sundance (Ms. Lively actually refers to them as such, paints herself as Etta Place and doesn't want to be around when they die) insult the Cartel Queen. Ms. Lively differentiates them as ""one likes to f@&k, the other makes love."" And the Ex-SEAL has 'wargasms'????Guess the story's path and how many bodies fall.In a punk opening scene, Ms. Lively's voice-over drives a flashback and leaves open her fate by story's end. This sets up an insulting, gimmicky twist ending that's also punk and not to be spoiled. Throw your own Milk Duds at the screen.Among too few, ""Savages"" saving grace is the Political subtext the left-leaning, axe-grinding Mr. Stone loves to incorporate. Anywhere along in ""Savages"" merely substitute the words Afghanistan or Iraq for Mexico. Here, however, Mr. Stone's political restraint works against ""Savages.""The other small savior of this disappointing film is the universally held belief others are savages. A brutal killer, a Mexican, believes the Americans are savages because they share a woman. The Americans believe the Mexicans are savages because they decapitate people just because it's Tuesday. A closer look at the great cultural differences separated by a common border is also AWOL.Action fans may get their fix from ""Savages."" There is sick brutality, double-dealing and lots of bang bang. There just isn't enough glue in between to hold it together or give it some meaning.

119,tpaladino,Should have been a LOT better.,5,8 July 2012,"This was not a great movie. It could have been a great movie, but it was let down in two major ways. First off, two of the three lead characters are awful. Blake Lively makes for good eye candy, but she just isn't a good actress. She's not bad in smaller supporting roles (like her part in The Town), but she simply cannot carry a lead. Unfortunately the entire film basically revolves around her (and she narrates), so her shortcomings are brought front and center. Every time her voice-over came on, I cringed. It really was not a good choice. Taylor Kitsch is no better. Again... good eye candy, poor acting. Very poor acting. He just has no soul, and brings absolutely nothing to his character whatsoever. He should be in a brainless Fast & Furious movie playing opposite Vin Diesel, not an Oliver Stone drama. The second major failure of this film is even more serious, and that is the story structure. We are never really given the opportunity to understand why the three lead characters (Chon, Ben and Ophelia) have such strong feelings for each other. We're told that they do, but never given any real reason to believe it. This is extremely important, because literally the entire premise of the film hangs on their relationship. If you're going to build a dramatic story around an unorthodox three- way relationship, you had better explain in more than one quick scene exactly how this relationship happened, otherwise the audience won't know why they should care about the characters. Especially when the actors portraying these characters aren't very good to begin with. I know that I kept asking myself why these two guys share a girl, how they have absolutely zero jealousy, why they never once thought of double-crossing each other, and why either of them care so deeply for her -- to the point of being willing to risk their lives and commit horrible atrocities to save her. Where did all this love and loyalty come from? It was never adequately explained, and the entire movie suffers tremendously for it.On a slightly more positive note, the veteran actors did a fine job. Benicio Del Toro was wonderful as a psychotic cartel underboss, John Travolta chewed the scenery to bits, and Salma Hayek was entirely believable in her role as well. Unfortunately, their competence only served to underscore the incompetence of the younger leads. It's telling that the best scene in the entire film was between Del Toro and Travolta, with none of the three lead actors anywhere to be found, and hinted at the promise this movie squandered. A lot of reviews took issue with the violence portrayed in the film, but I didn't have a problem with that. You really can't make a movie about Mexican drug cartels without violence, so I didn't feel it was gratuitous. Unfortunately, however, it also didn't make the movie any more believable from a plot perspective.Overall, I just don't think this was a very good film. I don't think that Stone felt entirely comfortable with what he was doing here, trying at times to be Tarantino but failing miserably. And likewise, I think that if this film had been in the hands of Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez, it likely would have come out much better, perhaps even great.",Savages

In the past I'd say that Oliver Stone movies for me usually fall quite short of expectation, but this time around he's in true and rare form with this violent, unusual cartel thriller.

Especially Del Toro, I'm amazed with this guy. Anything he touches turns to gold. Every scene he is in he completely dominates. Small mannerisms such as playing with his moustache, his daring eyes, surprising actions and general attitude are not to be missed. His conversation with Travolta towards the end is to die for.

I rarely care who the director of a movie is, however, the trailer promised a kind of film that starts slow, but then gets more extreme towards the end. Directed by Oliver Stone? Watch out, things could get violent. And it did, sort of. In my opinion the movie never developed a certain drive*. (You ever watch 8mm? Now that's what I call a slow-starting that descends into hell towards the end.) Savages never gets there. Based on the trailer you'd think these boys would raise hell to get their woman back, but... nah! Other things that were just not that good: - Blake Lively's voice over. And character. I'm supposed to care about her? Hope she would be saved? Why??? - The fake ending. Terrible. - The movie is too long for what little action we get. But good were: - Benicio's unpredictable character. - Some scenes (like the one in Travoltas house, when you think he's gonna get shot by del Toro) were hard to predict. I thought that was a nice touch. - The ice cream that I ate during the break. (I have myself to thank for that.)* Speaking of ""Drive""... I thought Drive would be a good thriller to watch.

126,GLanoue,"Bad script, wooden leads",6,28 January 2013,"I was a little surprised by some of the venom in these reviews, because the film is decently shot with great veteran actors (in secondary parts, unfortunately). But this is an Oliver Stone movie. We expect the heavy handed morality lesson to be told with a touch of irony, if not humour. No real irony here. There are two major problems, the leads and the script. First, the three main characters are a threesome so intimately bonded that even the otherwise mild mannered botanist-businessman Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is driven to horrible, immoral acts to rescue her after she (Blake Lively) is kidnapped to ensure that the independent pot-growing and dealing partners (Taylor-Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) will accept a deal with a Mexican drug cartel. Yet we are never really given any hint why the bond is so strong, except when the queen of the cartel (a brilliant Salma Hayek) chats with her hostage and suggests that the two boys love each other more than they love her, otherwise they would never share. This, BTW, is a pivotal scene because the love interest Lively reveals herself to be an uneducated airhead; drug queen Hayek has the best line of the movie; ""Do all Americans talk like that?"", addressed to Lively after she says she dropped out of community college after a semester and a half because she ""didn't get along with institutions"". In the end, none of the three has any real emotional depth; they script even tries to excuse Kitsch's wooden acting by implying something deep, like he's dead inside from the war, man. It doesn't work. We'd like to see a hidden, tormented self to make it believable that these three can be motivated to do anything more than catch the next wave when surf's up. Yes, I know there's a back-story that Ben makes good on his ill-gotten drug money by digging a well or two in Indonesia or some other Peace Corps venue, but it sounds really shallow and trendy instead of committed and complex. The real problem is the script. It's just horrible and shallow. Only the secondary actors do anything at all with this mess: John Travolta as a corrupt DEA agent who turns into a sort of hero, Benicio Del Toro, who's got scary whack job down to a science, and Hayek the drug queen who manages to convey that this isn't the life she would have chosen but nonetheless accepts it as a destiny that must be fulfilled and played out to its bitter end. For the rest, the pacing is pretty good; the ultra gory violence is believable and well-integrated into the script, the camera work excellent. Stone usually presents us with morally ambiguous characters or contrasts apparently evil people with an even more evil ""system"" (Wall Street, Natural Born Killers), forcing us to have some sympathy for the evil protagonist and eventually to call into question the morality of a system that can turn decent and even idealistic people into killers of weasels. Not here. Sure, the system is bad, but not because people deal in drugs but because they are shallow, hedonistic airheads. The three main protagonists are not evil because they are too shallow to be evil. Even when Taylor-Johnson kills the man he and his partner falsely set up as a patsy in a sting operation they ran, and then throws up apparently disgusted with himself, well, wouldn't you know that next day he's so stone cold capable of lying to the Mexican cartels and convincing them he had nothing to do with the sting. Is Stone now always to be tired and formulaic, depending on his three great actors in secondary roles, or is the sign of worse things to come?",Savages

The cops don't care, and their business really isn't that violent... that is until the Mexican drug cartel shows up and is like ""you are going to come work for us, and if you say no we kill you."" Naturally the two friends are like ""No, screw you."" The cartel retaliates by kidnapping their girlfriend, now they must get her back. So how did this film turn out? Is it as good as Platoon? Is it as bad as I hear Alexander was? Hell no to the first one, and no to the second one. While it has its flaws, it still knows how to entertain you and even makes you think a little bit. The main characters are assholes, yet you actually want them to succeed and kill the asshole cartel boys, who are EVIL. Who each character represents is kind of left up to you, obviously Jon Travolta represents ""The man"" otherwise known as the United States (Which I sort of find insulting, yet it is kind of true. He, in all honesty is actually the best part of the film). I'm actually torn on the villainess in the movie (The leader of the cartel), you want to hate her because of all the horrible things she has done and yet her origin story makes you feel incredibly sympathetic towards her. The main characters, while I was interested in what happened to them, I was far more interested in what was happening to the villains. The script here is sort of a mixed bag, the dialogue at times is so horrifyingly bad that you want to bang your head against a wall. Yet, at times it is also smart and well written. And as for the story, while it works it feels so drawn out despite it being as simple as it is. And as for the acting, it is for the most part really good and you can tell the people who played the villains had fun with their parts. The violence is also a mixed bag. At times, it is so extreme sometimes that it almost becomes one of the goddamn Hostel movies, and I've made it clear how much I hate those. Yet, whenever the shooting starts the movie gets so much better and you start to forget the problems the movie has. Savages is a good movie, but it most certainly is not a great movie. Yet, it is also a welcome return to form for Oliver Stone. It gets more right then it does wrong, but be warned: The film lives up to its title. Also the ending sucks.",Savages

132,Zulfmanauthor,Beautiful Savages!,8,24 August 2015,"Oliver Stone has this ability to leave his mark on a movie, he has style, finesse and more importantly brings unbridled savagery to his subject matter. Whether he is telling the story of 'Ron Kovic' or exposing the corruption on 'Wall Street', his movies are tough. This is why 'Savages' is no exception, a standard storyline based around drugs and violence, Oliver Stone directs a brutal yet poetic film which manages to stand out amongst films of the same genre. The film follows two friends and their booming narcotics business who are forced to confront a violent and merciless drugs cartel, who take their shared girlfriend in exchange for a piece of their business. The film is way more superior to Ridley Scott's terrible 'The Counselor', which has some similarities to this movie. Everything about 'Savages' isn't great, but the film is different and clever, it adds style in the right places and never tries too hard to be anything it cannot be. Most importantly in my opinion, this excessively violent thriller actually allows the female artists to not only have major roles but also dominate the landscape of proceedings.

That is a person who wrote the book but another is given the credit for it. This Oliver Stone film stinks of a movie that must of had a Ghost Director. Isn't Oliver Stone capable of better? This movie looks like (before you watch it) a movie that is going to be all punches like Goodfellas, Scarface, Platoon or even Lord of War. And yet, its not. Not even close to any of those. Oh how it tries to be some memorable movie about cartels and drugs but its not. It is FORGETTABLE.The plot ran slowly. And slowly can be good in well directed movies yet this one wasn't like I say it went nowhere. For example Breaking Bad is mostly slow, but it is well done slow and it always leads somewhere. This movie was slow and pretentious and had three of the worst actors in Hollywood. It truly went nowhere really.Taylor Kitsch (John Carter, Battleship) can not act, especially in a lead roll. Any movie this guy is given to be a lead in ends up being terrible. His acting is nonexistent and he needs to be reduced to a back up role.Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Kick Ass) not since Jon Heder has there been a nerd type actor who has been thrown into many others rolls. He is the best of the three bad actor leads but still not a lead role for an actor like this.Blake Lively (Gossip Girl) is the worst leading lady I have ever witnessed. She just can't act and her voice over in this movie just gets really really really annoying. What more can I say, you likely seen this movie if you're reading the ""Hated It"" reviews on IMDb so you know what I mean.Selma Hayek, John Travolta and Benicio Del Toro where fine in this movie. Also not their finest but not their worst performance either. They where just what you would expect to see from them.All in All, I hated this movie. It was terrible and boring and one of those movies that makes me feel I need to vent so I wrote a review here on IMDb. See my other reviews if you are interested.",Savages

Not great as she is one of the main leads. However, when I saw that Benicio del Toro, John Travolta and the stunning Selma Hayek were in it, I knew they'd make it worth a watch - and they did.Any film about the Mexican cartel is always going to show violence and this is pretty nasty in parts. I thought the story was a little different though, so it kept my attention throughout.Selma was fabulous in the role. Considering that Blake's character has two men obsessively in love with her, Selma knocks her out of the water in looks, figure and womanly sexuality and she has no lovers in this movie.It is a long film but I did enjoy it and it was never boring.

139,mattbaxter72,"Please, just make the voice-over stop",3,25 September 2012,"There are many bad things about this movie, but let's list the good things first. The plot makes sense, kind of. It's nicely shot, and the beach looked pretty. And... I guess John Travolta looked as though he was having fun? Which is more than I could say for the poor buggers who had to sit through this mess.Your two leads, ladies and gentlemen, are Aaron Johnson, last seen being upstaged by a preteen girl, and Taylor Kitsch, who Hollywood keeps casting as the lead in blockbusters which then tank spectacularly at the box office. You know why that is, Hollywood? It's because Taylor Kitsch has no charisma. None. The furniture was more interesting than he was, and had more emotional range. Even he's better than Johnson, a black hole of tedium from which nothing interesting can escape. These are two of the blandest leads I've ever seen, and I've seen movies that starred rappers.But dear God in heaven, they are much, much better than Blake Lively. I haven't seen much else of her acting, so I can only think she can do much better than this. But here she's playing a 30-year-old ingénue, a woman-child who knows Shakespeare but doesn't know what 'savages' means. She's meant to be sexy and alluring, but she comes across as so boundlessly stupid that no man could seriously find her attractive. I don't think that's her fault, but the no-nudity clause that made the sex scenes in this movie so absurd? Yeah, that was her fault.Even that isn't the worst. There's still... that voice-over. The narration that infests this whole movie, but especially the early scenes, is some of the worst writing I've ever heard. 'I had orgasms, he had wargasms' is a phrase that will live with me until I die. And now, even if you haven't seen the movie, it'll haunt your nightmares, too. You're welcome.",Savages
140,patrickwigington,Monstrous Beasts,8,8 July 2012,"Oliver Stone's recent films have been criticized for being heavy handed and lacking the edge that his earlier films like JFK and Natural Born Killers possessed. This reviewer, however, has liked Stone's movies of the past decade, which include World Trade Center, W., and Wall Street 2. Stone seems to have taken the criticism in stride and humor, because now he delivers a brutal, ridiculous, and ironic film that delivers the director's interpretation of the 21st century mindset of materialism, hypocrisy, and glorification of amoral violence.The narrator, and the character all the action revolves around, is Ophelia, nicknamed O by her two boyfriends, who are partners together in the weed industry. Ben, a college graduate and pseudo hippie, spends his spare time in charities and trying to make the world a better place. Chon, an ex-marine, seems to do little more than f*ck O and suffer from tremendous shell shock. Not that these characters are unlikable, in fact they are very easy to root for, considering all three of them are the lesser forms of evil in this film. Ben and Chon are trying to retire from the weed industry, but everything goes wrong when a Mexican drug cartel want to forcibly do business with them. Ben and Chon refuse, which results in O being kidnapped. The two business partners and lovers of O decide to do anything they can to get her back. This leads to a continually complex plot, which never stops building on itself until the very end.The acting is fantastic on all fronts. Blake Lively plays O, and she is a socially injured and self involved creature under the guise of a free spirit. Taylor Kitch, who played the eponymous John Carter, portrays Chon as practically a monster; he is a ravage beast that only cares for his small pack. And Aaron Johnson plays Ben, a man who thinks he has much to offer the world. But it is the supporting cast that really steal the show. Salma Hayek plays the head of the Mexican drug cartel that kidnaps O, and she is fantastic. Hayek's charisma dominates any scene she is in. She seems terrifying, honest, and approachable all at once. Benicio Del Toro as Hayek's minion is fantastic. He is the other monster of the film; a creature unable to show compassion or morals, and who kills without a second glance. Then there is John Travolta as the corrupt DEA agent who keeps Ben and Chon in business. Travolta is great fun to watch as he lies and schemes his way out of every corner his character is put in.Oliver Stone directs the film with a hyperactive style that seems both reminiscent of his work in the 90's, while simultaneously mocking it. His characters are all sociopaths, colliding together to create one enormous cluster-f*ck of a movie. Stone portrays Laguena Beach life as an ugly, hazy, and soulless existence, and Mexico as a hell hole of bloodshed. The action is intense, chaotic, and over the top. The cinematography by Dan Mindel is grainy and at times intentionally ugly. The locations are either barren deserts, ugly suburbia, or grimy, cold rooms with florescent lights. Stone captures a world of materialism and narcissism with this movie. Every character is a savage, every character is only trying to survive in a cruel, unattractive, and confusing world.It is important to keep in mind that Savages is a love it or hate it film, and that has very little to do with whether you ""get"" it or not. The film's plot can be infuriating, and the characters can all seem so shallow to the point of annoyance. There is also the matter of the ending, which is at the very least problematic.Oliver Stone's new film is a far cry from his recent civilized and more dramatic forays. His return to the chaotic ADD type filmmaking is certainly not a return to form, but more a criticism of it. Stone crams the movie with everything he is ""supposed"" to have in his movies, and makes a huge two hour vat of irony. If any of that sounds intriguing, you'll probably like it. If not, well, maybe you should play it safe and go see Katy Perry: Part of Me instead.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",Savages

I am not such a great fan of Oliver Stone and thought Wall Street 2 was not well done. Savages, on the other hand, was quite close to the book, gritty, and well done. If you have a problem with the portrayal of Seals or the realism of the scenarios then lay the blame on the book not Mr. Stone. Some of the scenes were certainly quite gory, an increasingly common occurrence in many films these days. So if that turns you off then don't watch the movie. On the other hand if you want to see a good thriller that will keep you entertained and are comfortable with the topic area, drug dealing and violence, then by all means see this movie and do not be put off by the any bad reviews.As for the ending, it was changed from the book and I think for the better.

143,thefilmdiscussion,"Oliver Stone back to his gritty, outlandish ways",8,13 September 2012,"Now this is the kind of film you'd expect from Oliver Stone. Filled with copious amount of gritty, violent action, sex, drugs and Stone's trademark visual flair, ""Savages"" is his best work since 1994's ""Natural Born Killers"". It tells the tale of O, a young California girl who lives with her two boyfriends, in the small Laguna Beach kingdom they've created for themselves with a lucrative pot business. They're not all bad, they sell a lot of their product for medicinal purposes and build up villages in third-world countries. In fact, they're almost ready to get out of the business altogether. Until the queen of a powerful Mexican cartel forces their hand and kidnaps O. The two mostly peace-loving friends have to decide what's most important to them, and set off on a bloody path of revenge and destruction to rescue O. The film is alive with energy, and the camera captures the sets and locations with a cool sizzle. Most impressive are the characters that Stone and his actors have crafted, all of them unique and quirky and unpredictable. Benicio Del Toro is in near Oscar-worthy form as the leader of a ""lawn-care"" crew that does a little more than lawn cleanup, as he maniacally twists his mustache. He's great.

144,richy1024,Stoners perform aggressively under Stone!,7,3 October 2012,"Controversial mastermind Oliver Stone announces his return since his woeful 2010 attempt with Wall Street with his adaptation of Don Winslow's drug-friendly novel. Stone's homecoming party is an adventurous attempt at escalating the war around drugs and the rift between Mexico and its northern counterparts. Predominately set in the beautiful but dangerous essence of Laguna Beach, which introduces us to an intimate threesome. O (Blake Lively), an attractive frontier craves her love within a triangle also occupied by a two-piece ambitious cannabis duo. After ditching a career in their respective university professions, both decide to earn their dollar by growing and selling dope, whilst indulging in unruliness and modification with the odd conflagration to brighten the scene just in case there wasn't enough combustion already within the region.Savages is an intense affair with plenty of passion and vehement. Marijuana is the driving force behind every form of movement, whilst the film's title tags both borders under the same category of honour and dignity. Both sides prove to be the ultimate contender, after a failure in agreement Salma Hayek and her troops emphatically take leadership by the act of pilfering. Unfortunately for Hayek, underestimating the opposition is only the inauguration of Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben's (Aaron Johnson) repercussions. Whilst all this takes place we integrate ourselves within a lackadaisical female by familiarising ourselves with O's bareness and insecurities with her beloved double act, her daydreaming persona and how her bliss lifestyle comes under relentless scrutiny when planted within a room without beaches and lush panorama. To her, life is perfection, she has everything she needs, funds are incessant and her devotees fulfil both sides of her love pattern. During O's fateful circumstances the relationship between Chon & Ben proves ferociously practised with years of loyalty and love towards each other.There is some wonderful editing with rapturous gunfire sequences and the usage of a glowing colour scheme. The narrative incorporates many themes from love to politics, to betrayal, greed and anxiety, providing us with a thesis that suggests even paradise has its blemishes. Stone's emphatic take on business ethics and the grimness of stealing someone's prize possession is rather compelling. He pulls of a narrative capable of entertaining the masses but sadly it elongates itself far beyond any recommendation, regrettably extending beyond the two hour boundary does provide the film with weary jaded effect after a while. Though it's blissful emphasis on how making one 'erroneous' verdict can cause intense complication is rather encapsulating.",Savages
145,dario_malic,"Say you, say me, say him",4,4 October 2012,"Many speak of ""Savages"" as Oliver Stone's return to form. It certainly looks that way at first glance. Gritty, violent story about Chon and Ben, two drug dealers trying to rescue their mutual girlfriend O from the hands of the Mexican mafia powered with such stars as John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro and Salma Hayek as well as youngsters Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson in leading roles. But then I became sceptical. Oliver Stone hasn't made a noteworthy movie (documentaries aside) for more than fifteen years and the other writers don't have appealing resumes (one of them, Don Winslow, is also the author of the book which the movie is based on, but writing a good book doesn't mean you can write a good screenplay). Still, I couldn't help hoping this one would be a hit so I went to watch it.And what a hit it was. A succession of hits, actually. It first hit me with useless and badly done narration by O, the girl who gets kidnapped. Then it hit me again with really bad characterization. All the characters are just a pack of clichés, without an ounce of personality in them, doing whatever is necessary for the story to progress. Another hit. Acting. I must admit the actors weren't given much to work with but some of the blame lies on them too. Blake Lively is awful as a spoiled addict O and Taylor Kitsch isn't much better as PTSD-suffering Chon. even the pros like Travolta and Del Toro seem like they don't know what they are doing. Travolta plays Dennis, a DEA agent so corrupt and double-crossing, I don't know how he manages to remember which side is he on at any given moment, and Del Toro plays a professional killer who likes to torture people and rape girls. Bearing that in mind, their acting is straightforward comedic. And here is where the final hit comes in. Screenplay. It's so poorly written that you wonder how did they even get it filmed. You get the feeling that the tone of the movie is supposed to be serious but then, out of the blue, happens something undeniably parodic. It is maybe intentionally so, but it makes the movie very uneven and just doesn't work. Not to mention completely unnecessary and incomprehensible decisions like revealing Elena has a daughter in the beginning of the movie and crossing her with O while shopping in some mall. What purpose does that have? It just lets us conclude what will happen later in the movie thus removing any suspense. Or showing us Elena getting close with O to make nothing of it and simply discard it a few minutes later. There's just no sense in most of the things in this movie.What's even worse, the movie doesn't seem to have an answer to the most important question. What is the point of it? Why do we have to sit and watch it for over two hours? What does it tell us? It seems there is no point. The most corrupted guys end up as winners while our ménage à trois moves to some exotic place and, in O's words, regress to living some kind of primal, savage life (although savages didn't have bathing suits from what I recall). So okay, they're all savages. Or we're all savages? Is that what the movie is trying to tell us? Does it have a point after all? Maybe. The problem is that it just doesn't make you care.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",Savages

In the end, I was glad it only cost me a couple of euros, otherwise I'd have felt robbed if I bought it on Amazon or went to see it at the movies.All I can say about it was it was OK for a slow evening watching it in a hotel room. I thought it would be good because it was Oliver Stone. It was just a succession of episodes from one to the other. I couldn't identify with any of the characters, and Travolta....well, he just wasn't trying at all.I didn't care about the kidnapped girl and like other reviewers, I have absolutely no idea why this menage a trois was supposed to be so solid that the two guys - who are very different so how does the girl love them both? - risk everything, including their lives, for her.Forget every other criticism, the central aspect of the menage just does not add up so the entire plot is built on nothing. Two extremely rich young guys living in southern California who don't have to work share one woman? I don't think so.And here's a slight spoiler. At the end, the narrator, O, says people may be wondering where they are 'In Africa, or Kenya, or....' Well, young miss, Kenya is an African country.

149,filmchaser,A Boy and His Bong,3,25 December 2012,"I love movies and watch them with an open mind remembering that this is somebody's art. Even the most open of minds can't make sense of this film, and it was just torture to watch for several reasons. First, that narration by Blake Lively was flat, and poorly written, making it a constant annoyance throughout the film, and making her seem replaceable. So why would we care if she is killed by some drug lord? We were hoping for the relief. Second, there was the absence of a back story that would explain to any intelligent and modern audience why these two handsome, rich, guys would waste their time on some average looking, obviously non-monogamous, space cadet, much less share her sexually, much less trust her with all their confidences, much less be in LOVE with her. What was there to love about that character other than her readily accessible vagina? Third, dear, dear Mr. Stone: if you want to make the audience fear for the delicate kidnapped flower's life by showing us gore scene after gore scene of torture, death, and blood-smear everywhere, why then would you create a character like ""O"" (I think the two guys were just too disinterested to remember her entire name) who, after being kidnapped and roughed up would DEMAND to talk to someone, to have better food, to have a better room from her psycho kidnappers? Lively's character just came off as a shallow, annoying, whore. Could this have been worse? Oh but wait, it does get worse. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is arguably one of the best young actors today, is wasted as the laid back guy, while Taylor Kitsch is once again typecast as the heavy. And how many ex-SEAL's are likely to support such an unpatriotic and illegal business when they can make so much legal money as stunt men, consultants, or action figures? Then, out of nowhere, we see Emile Hirsch cast in some nominal role he made the best of, but again, was totally wasted in, and frankly, I wish they had cast him in one of the lead roles because it would've been a much better movie. Benecio Del Toro has now been typecast as the psycho more than once, but at least he didn't mutter or turn into a werewolf. John Travolta was good as the corrupt DEA agent. Salma Hayek was good as the conflicted ruthless widow-cum-cartel-queen-and-loving-mother role, but the woman had a lot of hats to wear in that one character as if the director couldn't decide if she was a heroine or a villain in his very disconnected film. Lastly, I'd like to say, I wish Taylor Kitsch would be given permission to act, because from what I've seen of him in his other films, he's more than eye-candy, and without good direction, it seems like he is being limited in range, not to mention being written into a character that has little credibility. I'd have been impressed if we had been given an explanation of his name: Chon. Is that an acronym for Confused, Handsome, Orphaned, Narcissist? There is no chemistry between him and ""O"" whatsoever, and typically, the type of man who would qualify to become a SEAL is not a man who would risk rotting away in federal prison for money made by illegal means, and is definitely not the type of guy that would be best friends with the type of guy played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, or the kind of man who would entrust his heart to a promiscuous surfer-shopping-mall-rat. So Mr. Stone, a little explaining about how these (3) were so irreversibly committed to each other in such a new age kind of no-boundaries-free-love-keep-O-pampered-way, so as to be willing to DIE for each other would have been a favor to the audience, as well as possibly connecting some facts leading to an actual plot a lot more credibly. Where is the story? Do your job. And fire the continuity and editing departments. You're no Guy Ritchie, that's for sure. And people only like Quentin Tarantino because he likes to out-weird himself with every movie, but even gore and torn bodies can get boring if there is no point to the splatter. You had an opportunity to make a love story gone wrong. You first have to convince us that there IS love. What bonds these two men with this vapid and shallow woman? What we DO see is the love between a boy and his bong, between a boy and a posse of smart employees, between a boy and his local DEA agent, between a boy and his money, and between a boy and his ""wargasms.""

They're love is evident, and so simple as to not be even worthy of any small-minded titilation. Together, they sell weed. Great weed...powerful, magical weed, and have built their own close-knit organization of free-thinking experts, including a security branch of ex-soldiers. Business is booming.Enter the Baha Cartel, represented by the polished and lethal agent played wonderfully by Demian Bichir, cultured on the surface, but lethal beneath. The cartel is outlined simply - a modern criminal organization with plenty of complexity and diversity, but with competitors of its own and a very violent, dangerous, culture. They want new territory.The cartel's bloody work is carried out by Lado (embodied by Benicio Del Toro) a down-to-earth cold-blooded enforcer - a flat-out sociopath, really. Del Toro easily steals every scene he's in......Except for those with Salma Hayek, who really shines as Elena, the no-nonsense, feared, head of the cartel. I'd like to just emphasize that this is some of Hayek's best work, by far - she really nails the complexity of a woman who, through fate and choice, is leading an ultra-violent criminal gang - with an iron f--king fist in fact - but who is still human, with pain and fears of her own.In the end, the tale is about these men and women and how they each protect what they care about most, which is usually each other. The actors really seem to bond, which lends a lot of investment to get us through a fairly wild and crazy plot.Add in some artistic (but not too pretentious) camera work and editing, good pacing, and some really great technical touches, and you have a solid crime drama with a lot of heart and soul.

Sadly, however, it isn't, and the last person you'd expect to jump on this particularly sub-fascist train, would be the director of perhaps the best ever liberally minded political conspiracy thriller of all time, Oliver Stone. Stone shows that he's one who will willingly adapt himself to suit trends, but unfortunately, there is little passion in this especially empty film. The sunny, travelogue photography never quite manages to get any dramatic traction with the subject matter, and the stars are much the same.Aaron Johnson, Taylor Kitsch and Blake Lively play a particularly unlikely gang of hippyish drug dealers, who seem convinced that they're out to do the world a favour by producing the best marijuana in the industry. The trio are a classic example of the type of empty, soulless good-looking types cast to divert people from the actual substance of your film. All three deliver beautifully dead performances, never managing to sound anything other than bored or unconvincing, and, as the lead characters, they certainly do flatten the drama out impeccably, let alone the immoral politics of their characters' particular beliefs, which leave a lot to be desired. Basically, it's immorality done up in a nice, neat modern bow, which seems like absolutely nothing on the surface, but in actual fact, is deeply subversive to the sort of people who rarely go beneath the surface.The plot is a mish-mash of romanticised violence, and brutalist-macho clichés which never really transcend a totally bored air from the director, from the script, and from the majority of the performers. As well as the young, hot and tedious trio, there's an equal number of older, but by no means wiser actors who attempt to provide the film with some gravitas. It's a tribute to how bad the majority of the cast are, when Benicio Del Toro is one of the better people on screen, but, on its' own, his performance is utterly lacking in emotional maturity, all full of fake twitchiness and assumed mannerisms, and clichéd sadistic dialogue like ""OhI hate it when they scream,"" and supposedly weird things, like licking Blake Lively's spit off his own face. Which, admittedly, is pretty damned weird. A kiwi-fuzz John Travolta is on hand to play a dull, expository character, with a performance that illustrates a well-known fact; that John Travolta is a horrendously embarrassing actor, who cannot act to save his life. There's a scene added in the commercially available ""extended edition"" with him speaking to his dying wife, which beggars belief.In fact, from casting to plot to substance to morality, there really is very little going on that's worth the wait, and the exorbitantly overlong 2 hours 15 running time goes past very slowly indeed. There are, however, a small handful of things which make this languorous, pretentious, shallow film worth watching, and however small they may be, they contribute an awful lot to this film as a whole. In no particular order, there's a fairly standard informer-punishing scene, with Del Toro in full creepy, over-the-top sadist mode, which overdoes the brutality on a scale appropriate to such an unrealistic, and out of scale film, and the attempts to squeeze a moral dilemma from Aaron Johnson's character seem particularly artificial. However, there's a nice moment of music which kicks in at the close of this scene – I believe the track name is ""Force of Nature"", from the fairly okay score album by Adam Peters. Suffice it to say, that this is the only decent merging of music and image to create an in any way dramatic effect, and it's one of those trailer scenes which sends a chill down your spine, despite the fact you're not really that involved with any of the characters. Because that's what a good soundtrack is capable of doing.Secondly, and perhaps more importantly though, is Elena, the character, and Salma Hayek, the actress, who I would argue is the only half way decent performer in the entire movie. However, it's not just Salma's performance which is entertaining, but rather her characterisation as a slinky, sexual in control woman who is never objectified as such. Her long, silky black Cleopatra hair, and array of sumptuous gowns and stylish clothing serve to give her more presence than all the skeleton masked psychos going around killing people, and blowing things up. Credit to Costume Designer Cindy Evans and Hair Stylist Rhonda Ann Burns, more known for TV work than big screen fare for elevating this amazing character to iconic status. There's also a gorgeous scene, worth the entrance fee alone, where the regal Hayek sits back and has her feet massaged by Maya Merker, her Hispanic Maid, which she does with all the aloofness of a queen...and,she does have exceptionally beautiful feet. They are the stars of the show, definitely.If you're still with it, then be prepared for one of the most pointless cinematic gambits you'll ever have seen, with an ending that's so clichéd and flat and pointless, that it had to be preceded by an imaginary over-the-top ending, just to make it seem more ""reasonable"" by comparison – which, by the way, it doesn't. It just concludes a long film unsatisfactorily, with more closeted references to a homosexual relationship between its lead actors than a Josef von Sternberg film. And that's saying something.The extended edition actually offers virtually nothing to recommend it, and actually includes scenes which were wisely cut in the first place. It's just more of the same, really. So, like I said, there is virtually nothing to recommend itother than the aforementioned gems. Which are pretty damn spectacular, let me tell you. But as a whole film? As an intelligent work of art? As a work of solid entertainment? Nah",Savages
155,guyau-399-68372,Promising drug thriller loses the plot,6,14 December 2012,"Oliver Stone certainly can direct and this is a good thriller with great action scenes until undermined by cliché and serious script flaws. The performances are good, and the characters mostly believable. Benecio del Toro's standout sadist threatens to descend into melodrama, but family scenes with this very flawed father give his character depth. For the first half the movie is tight, convincing and ratchets up the tension beautifully but the rambling second half descends into confusion and silliness. It seems the studio process ran away with story.BIG SPOILER HERE, POST VIEWING ANALYSIS: The flaws in the script really begin with the opening line from the Blake Lively (Ophelia or O) narrator: ""Just because I'm telling you this story doesn't mean I'm alive at the end of it"". Well, it kinda does mean you're alive, doesn't it, unless we are not going to see the ending. OK, I'm nit-picking, but for me the big problem really starts with the Salma Hayek character - the ruthless but impossibly beautiful and sexy drug lord. Yeah, sure, who came up that box office formula? When she develops a motherly relationship with O, after having her abducted and tortured, you really know it's time to suspend all disbelief. Then somehow Taylor Kitsch and a few old navy seal buddies manage to track down and eliminate an army of drug gangsters (where the whole US government has failed, but OK that's standard action fare), then a computer hacker weaves clichéd magic and unbelievably frames a mobster, Benecio del Toro shoots a young guy for no reason than to prove he's mean (yeah, we already knew that), and O's touching marijuana withdrawal scene with her new abductor mom is just ludicrous. The final lunacy comes at the end - both of them – which smacks of running alternative finales by a test audience but not being able to decide which to chose.UNSPOILED SUMMARY: Ultimately this is a clichéd thriller, which it does well if you're a fan of the genre and can overlook the story problems, but I expected something special from Oliver Stone.",Savages

Not to say that neither of them have done good work because they have. They've both done far more middle of the road films and performances than stand out ones though.

That includes those who are supposed to know what they're talking about within the business. This movie was all sex and drugs and lacked any heart to get you (or me at least) to care about anything that happens in the movie. It's simple. If I don't care, why am I watching? There's no shock value that this movie provides that hasn't been done before. So I'm not wowed by that. There's no 'wow' story line or scenes.

After making such brilliant films as JFK, Platoon and Natural Born Killers, you have lowered yourself to the likes of Wall Street 2 and this heaping pile of dog manure, Savages.The star of the movie, Blake Lively, essentially plays a spoiled whore. Hard to root for that type of person. She is paired up with 2 rich entrepreneurs. Now, I know there are different relationships on this planet, but I find it a bit hard to believe that 2 young, attractive, in-shape rich guys would end up sharing a girlfriend like that...it just didn't feel possible. Atrocious writing. Then, in a line that rivals ""Oh my Godddd"" from Troll 2 and ""He's the Lawrence of my labia"" from Sex and the City 2, Lively spouts, when speaking of screwing the war veteran, ""I have orgasms. He has wargasms."" Grrrrr! How f-ing stupid is that f-ing line?!?! It pisses me off to be honest with you. Wargasms? Come on. Just bad writing.The voice-over from Lively as well...terrible. It truly sounded like an audition tape from one of those online broadcasting colleges. And Emile Hirsch...what was he doing in this movie? His part should have been played by a talented extra. He was completely wasted, a ""nothing"" role. Hirsch personally must have had a few difficult days driving into work during filming, wondering where his career was heading.And how in the world, Stone, are you going to start a movie off with the voice-over of Lively saying something to the effect of ""just because I'm talking at the start doesn't mean I'm alive at the end""...just for her to end up being friggin alive at the end?! WTF?! But I could excuse all these things...all of them...if the movie wasn't such a BORE!

You have patience and may survive a cartel interrogation as opposed to this slack-jawed, obvious and lazily scripted mess. I don't blame Oliver Stone, I blame his studio, producers, editors and the pantry of writers who put together (which did include Stone but I digress) this nonsense.I would've been far more appeased if they all died at the end! Spoiler! They don't the three newbies to the drug business, live. Well two of them do. (Eye roll)
No audience needs Blake Lively explaining to them what they are seeing because no audience is as one dimensional as her character, or technique.Also, this story is unreal, a longtime Cartel boss is made a fool by three well to do white American do*chebags! I'm sorry two well to do white do*chebags, Lively is apparently just the bologna in this plain and simple bologna sandwich of a couple. I know throuples are a thing, however not like this they're not. I would rather have just seen the two men go at it, and kitsch be angry all the time without any presence of Lively that may have been more interesting than this washed out narrated dreck. These idiots got far fast pulling the wool over Hayek's eyes which makes it rough to swallow let alone enjoy. Salma's character and ONLY her character was the character worth watching, well hers and Del Toro's. The performances by Del Toro and Hayek and maybe Johnson are great. As in well done and their performances added to the film, Kitsch and Lively are better performers as ""drying paint"" or ""couple in background"".

167,DiCaprio74,Is this really Oliver Stone,6,6 July 2014,"This movie could've been better if in the hands of Tarantino or Scorsese. It was a major let down for two reasons. One major reason was the choice of characters. Blake Lively plays a 30 something year old ingénue who can quote Shakespeare but not understand a simple word such as 'savages'. She's a good choice in eye candy but her acting skills are very impoverished. She is copacetic in smaller roles (New York, I Love You) but cannot be a lead in a movie. Taylor Kitsch is also not a very good choice. He has no type of magnetism. Also good eye candy, but also impoverished acting. He should stick to doing military movies (Lone Survivor), not Oliver Stone dramas.The second major let down was the story structure. We are never given the opportunity to fully understand why the relationship between the lead roles (Johnson, Kitsch & Lively) are the way they are. How this relationship happened, how they're was zero jealousy between the men and why they were willing to risk they're lives and commit atrocities to save her. It was never thoroughly explained and that made the movie suffer for it. On a better note, the veteran actors did an amazing job. John Travolta, Selma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro all did unbelievable jobs. The best scene in the film was the conversation between Del Toro and Travolta, in which none of the three lead roles were involved. The violence on the other hand was acceptable. But like I said, it could've been better if in the hands of Tarantino or Scorsese. Overall, it wasn't a very good movie. It will not go into the category of Stones' classic movies. It would've probably been a great movie if there was a more effort put into it.",Savages

169,tan1415,Don't understand the low ratings,8,14 October 2012,"Just saw this movie. It has such bad reviews...had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised.The violence was quite graphic...no problems with that. Matter of fact...the violence was actually not over the top but quite realistic.I had more a problem with how they were so positive about the soft drugs and the trade. No violence, helping the sick people. The heroes using it just before going into action. Seems to much like a left-wing propaganda film to legalize soft drugs. It was extremely funny that it was left to Elena to warn her about her drug use and how it impacts her ability to concentrate. From personal experience I know how detrimental soft drugs is and when you use it a lot also what a huge impact it will have on your body, mind and personality. What i missed was the background stories. I really liked Salma HAyek. but that was the problem to me...she was too likable and even sympathetic. People are afraid of her and her organization...but it didn't really show with her. To me it seemed a woman who made the best of a tragic situation in a violent business. But there must be a good reason why she is so feared. Right now it seemed that her henchman are the scary bad asses...and IMO it only show how much of a bad ass she is if these guys are afraid of her. So what i wanted to see..was her evil side.Also quite interesting how the bad guys were all family persons with kids, families etc. And I wonder how many more movies will come in with the Mexican cartels as the bad guys. Second movie after end of watch with them as the new flavor of the month bad guys.Anyway for the rest...the movie was quite good. i still feel it could last longer like other Stone projects. Giving the movie more depth on the background stories.The story it self was good and quite cool with plenty of action. The high tech way of doing business of the good guys and also using ex army veterans as the muscle. After the last decade of continuous warfare its for the first time since Vietnam that there are a lot of veterans in the US community. A lot of US movies are using this as a main plot or as a tie in.

Oliver has just lost his touch. So unfortunately I won't be watching any more Oliver Stone feature films from this point on. Savages was just too savage to sit through. I fast-forwarded through one third of it and it was still unbearable. The characters were dry, one dimensional, and their actions did not match their profiles. And the dialogue was so cliché and on the nose. So whenever there was dialogue scenes I just eventually started fast forwarding because nothing is more boring than watching characters talk about the plot. And the endless voice-over at the beginning middle and end Both unnecessary and painful. Do yourself a favor and skip this. Even the unrated version was disappointing as there was not even any boob shots to fast forward to (What's the point of showing a half- dozen ""savage"" sex scenes if the chicks leave their tops on?) They show people being beheaded, savage murders, Explosions, gun fights, a guy being burned alive, drugs, lots of filthy language, and several sex scenes with naked male butts thrusting up and down...but no nips? Just a disappointment all around. It's sad when you have to stoop so low to find entertainment in a movie. If you want to see some good sensual nudity, Blackswan or Mulholland Dr., surely deliver.

One of them is more of a ""save the universe"" type guy and holds a degree in Business and Botany. Yes, pot heads in High Schools everywhere just rejoiced ""It's a real thing!"" and the other one, suffering from anger issues stemming from tours in Iraq takes care of the ""beating the crap out of people when necessary"" aspect. Oh yeah, they also share a girlfriend. (Awkward right?), her name is O (Lively). No really it is I swear. Anyways, moving on because we have to, these two guys have made some of the best pot known to man and have made millions from it. (Still can't find their own girlfriend though, just saying). Everything is going great as they take turns with their shared girlfriend (still weird) in their huge beach house when the Mexican drug cartel decides they want to be partners. This actually stands for ""We own you now and you know you like it."" Ben and Chon don't really feel like being De-decapitated so they decide to make a go of living in a jungle somewhere until Elena (Hayeck) the ruthless lady leader of the cartel has O kidnapped.So are you over the fact that our two heroes share a girl yet? OK good, because I'm not either. This is one of those films that can only be enjoyed if you can let go of a few things. The whole film is narrated by O in her stoned and lazy version of her ""OMG you guys I am so high right now"" voice. She is a lot like her role in The Town only without the Boston accent. She is really annoying as a character and it's kind of hard to feel bad for her much less root for her. This is one of the things you have to let go of to enjoy the film. Ben and Chon worked well because they are the exact opposite to one another yet somehow have the respect for each-other to get along despite their constant different point of views. Kill everybody or run away. Ben was almost as annoying as O because he was always whining and psycho-analyzing everything. I found Chon to be my favorite of the three because he seemed to be the only one who just wanted to actually get things done and blow up some stuff while everyone else talked and talked some more.Villains make films though and despite the awkwardness and UN-likability of some of the lead roles the bad guys were sinister, relentless and kind of funny at times. One interaction between Elena's ruthless right hand man Lado (Del Toro) and out for himself FBI agent Dennis (Travolta) in particular was tense and humorous at the same time. Travolta was surprisingly great in this film as he looked like his old self and I was pleased to see he had a larger part in the film than anticipated. Elena had a well written back story as well as the bad guys, while certainly crude enough to hate were interesting enough to steal the flick. Savages UN-intentionally gives us no-one to root for and may even get on your nerves for a moment or two with its anything goes mentality. There is no doubt however, that it has some great action sequences, well written dialog (minus a few horrendous lines by O's character), strong acting by a strong cast and is an all-around well-made film all the way up until it's absolutely dreadful crash and burn of an ending. I won't give anything away here but let's just say this ending is a problem.

But first, the bad. The movie starts out in one of the more cliché ways possible, and when you see the style of cinematography, you'll understand. That's not necessarily bad, but showing people being decapitated for 10 seconds then having a lovely guitar song playing accompanied by a great view of the beach, well, suffice to say that the shock and awe factor was not there. Then there's the sex, and I won't give it away, but it's there just because it's sex.Then there are tons of other things that don't really help the plot at all, but there were also good things. Travolta, of course, really brings some needed substance to the film. He's the knowledgeable accomplice type, he's the sneaky cheeky turncoat, he's the comic relief, all in 1. Without him, the film does not work. Well, him and Del Toro. They're both forced into type-cast roles, but they make the most out of it. In fact there are a handful of other great unknown actors here, but as I said, you'd never know it, because the plot is entirely cliché and typical.I guess the one twist comes at the end, but for most people it will be more of a dissatisfying twist. I didn't mind it though, so I'd say if you think of yourself as a seasoned movie vet who's going to critically analyze this, don't see it. If you're up for some mild entertainment, sure, why not.

This one's not an exception.Pretty much everything about this movie sucks. It is overwritten (voiceover opens the film and NEVER STOPS), miscast, over-scored (with music from HEAT and other movies), over-directed... it's just a piece of garbage. If you think you'll like this film, see WAY OF THE GUN instead. It is a far better outlaw film with better acting, direction, script, and score. Benicio is in that one as well. This movie is so bad that there are literally two endings and they're both horrible HORRIBLE. I cannot recall the last time I saw a movie in the theatre and there was a universal, collective GROAN from the audience. I burst out laughing. The first unsatisfying ending happens and you wait for the credits to roll but instead, a second ending starts and everyone GROANS. Hilarious.",Savages
181,lorenzo212,Oliver Stone the way we love,10,1 July 2012,"""Savages"" is Oliver Stone the way we like him - gritty, sexy, and oh-so-violent. This film starts as a simple story of a laid-back crew of Southern Californian pot dealers, but develops into and all out warfare between them and notoriously ruthless Mexican drug cartels, fronted by a very mean Selma Hayek. This is a Hayek we have not seen before - so gritty and dirty, yet so beautiful and elegant. And who is Hayek's backup - the dirtier than ever Benicio del Toro - in a magnificent performance. Yet the gang still has their hopes with John Travolta, and he steals the show. Drama in every scene, nothing is predictable, a statement from Stone on living in Southern California, which could be anywhere, in this day and age. We are all subject to the whims of the world, as Stone proves, we are perhaps too connected, too much. The world is not a large place anymore, but a terrifyingly small area, where unscrupulous people create havoc. A great storyline, great acting, depth, drama - all top of the line. Do see this one, it is fresh and new, exciting, and will leave you breathless. The 'ultra- violence' of the Droogies in ""Clockwork Orange"" have nothing on Stone's vision of violence in this masterpiece.",Savages

I really liked the acting - yes, the leads were a little less than perfect and easily eclipsed by Travolta and Del Toro (but then they would be). Del Toro is perfectly cast btw.Enjoy it for what it is. Trust me you will be really rooting for the good guys (who might be the bad guys??)and pleased that they thought of a way to succeed. I liked it and i would recommend it. It had just the right twists and turns to make it It's no art house or French nu wave but it's a solid film, just right for Friday.

183,lisa-629,I actually wanted O to be killed for being a spoiled whore,1,15 August 2012,"First of all, shame on you Oliver Stone, you sold out. This isn't your movie, this film isn't deep, it isn't memorable, it is a heaping pile of bad decisions. First of all, Blake Lively's character....my God....I love Lively, but the character of O is just unbearable. She's a uber rich pot head, attended one semester of community college before she realized it was just like, I don't know, not for me man....then she meets two drug dealers that she eventually moves in with, and ends up sleeping with them both, regularly. Never, at any point in the film, did I sympathize with her character. I actually slowly yearned for her to be murdered or blown up, anything. The story consists of Hayek trying to start a partnership with the two guys that bang the same rich whore. They don't want to, so whore gets kidnapped by Del toro. I would like to add here that Benicio is the best part of this God awful film. His was the only character I enjoyed. Also, whore complains that, you know, she'd like a salad, or like, something instead of pizza from her captors. Then she constantly pisses and moans about needing to speaking to the boss (Hayek), so she can beg her for some weed. Yes, she's kidnapped, suffering, living in a filthy room, and she wants weed and a salad. I will now remind you that this is a OLIVER STONE film. Ugh! So whore is kidnapped, her boy toys do a bunch of stupid things and are finally able to do a trade for O with Hayeks daughter. Then, something happened, something that convinced me that Hollywood simply doesn't care about creating a quality film. The film ends, with an actual great ending, like Stone- esque...I was captivated, then Stone took a dump on my happiness by saying....oh but this is how it really happened. I wanted to die, but I went with a friend and I drove, therefore being responsible for her transportation back home, on a Sunday night, knowing she had to work in the morning, dealing with my death would've been a rather large inconvenience. And I'm a great friend, so I sat through the second ending that was sh!t. Pure human excrement. I honestly left the film with my mouth gaping. I would like to also mention that Blake Lively's character is raped in the film. I actually announced on my way out that the film was so awful, that I was glad she was raped. Although insensitive, I know, if you see this film, I believe you will walk out saying the same thing.",Savages
184,vladp6,Anti-criticism,10,18 March 2014,"I've voted 10 in order to raise a bit the very low rating for this film. It's actually a good movie by Maestro Stone, which seems to be strongly under-appreciated. I read many negative reviews here and laughed at them. In my opinion, the plot is interesting, acting and performance are good, and the dynamics of the film is excellent.I've watched the uncut version, so there are several important scenes have been added, which make a huge difference. Without these cut scenes, the theatrical version should look pretty plain. The monologue of Travolta about the American order is extremely important, and of course it has been cut from the theatrical version (no surprise), as well as the true relationship between Lado and his wife. Both cut scenes serve a good basis for the finale of the movie.The questions about love in three is completely irrelevant. Reading reviews questioning this kind of love and wondering 'why' and 'how' made me really laughing. They just love each other, so what's the problem? Should everything be explained for the dumb and childish audience, which has got used watching the rubbish movies full of CGI effects, with brainless heroes and minimal acting? And I well understand the motives of the guys. This is the love movie in ala Tarantino environment. It reminded me True Romance in some way. Now I see, where Counselor came from.All in all, Savages is highly recommended, although it's not a chef d'oeuvre, just another good movie to watch in your free time.",Savages
185,fayesbridegroom,"Compassion is that which makes the heart of the good move at the pain of others. It crushes and destroys the pain of others; thus, it is called compassion.",8,14 February 2013,"This is an amazing movie. Emotive, political and even spiritual.Therefore I would liken Savages to The Godfather, in its depth, And study of the the male ego.When natural Born killers was released it was banned in the UK. Perhaps part of the reason was its moral code? As it was controversial as much as it was integral. Savages on a basic level deals with relationships and the way that the form the fabric of our humanity. Refreshingly Polygamy is given a supportive portrayal as is drug use.Furthermore the emotional destruction caused by firearms is very clearly portrayed. The ending is one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen in a film. And is created to invoke intimacy with the viewer. challenging the way media feeds us clichés. The changes that each character go through enables each of them to become more spiritually whole. each person must face their own demons : whether it is compassion for a ex solider, sadism for a Buddhist. or humility for someone with vanity.As Families can be found in all walks of life and this film shows how a family in love can creates a spiritual space, a dampening of the ego. Likewise the opposite a family without love will wither. even from the most aggressive of hands. I would then conclude the ego plays a large part in the making of a 'savage.' For when we have no-one to yield to, are we are left with stagnation? I took all of this and more from this great movie.",Savages
186,UberGoober1411,An empty plot mixed with sub-par acting from the entire cast leads to yet another revenge story,4,10 July 2012,"When I first saw this preview in the theaters, upon seeing Oliver Stone's name a kind lady said, ""Oh! Oliver Stone, this should be good!"". Oh how wrong she was. Savages is another one of Stone's tries at greatest and let me tell you it's farther than a stone's throw from greatness than it could ever be.The story starts off with the background events which one can find out by just watching the preview. Ben and Chon grow the best weed in the world and when the drug cartels move north into Laguna Beach and Ben and Chon refuse to partner with them, those said cartels steal O, or Blake Lively, away from them as a revenge tactic. But revenge is not merely what they want - what they truly want is that partnership. The plot eventually unfolds revealing the background story of many of the characters, all of which the audience doesn't really care about. Aside from the basic information about Ben and Chon's previous lives, the plot decides to spend time telling us who in Salma Hayek's family died; something that we don't care about.Although this movie was slatted as an action film, the action is few and far between. In all, there are about 3 action scenes through the entire film, with the rest of the movie being encompassed by boring interviews with nobody's and the useless torture of ""bad guys"". The grotesque nature of the action in this film does little to redeem it, only briefly taking our attention away from the character flaws and stories we really don't care about. All we really needed to know was that there was a drug war and people are going to die. Then the two main characters pick up a Batman and Robin-esque relationship and swing off to rescue the damsel in distress.Aside from the horrific story-telling and the seemingly endless boring parts of the film, there a few plot twists that will peak your curiosity. And when I say a few I mean just that: two. You will walk out of the theater disappointed and confused why the movie wasn't so much more.All-in-all the emptiness of the characters, endless droll talking, and ridiculously luxurious hospitality for Blake Lively while she is being held prisoner, Savages is yet another blip on the radar, much like Colombiana. The movie does nothing to set itself apart from every other revenge story that has ever been told and with just decent acting to barely hold it above water, this movie is barely worth a watch for the $10.+2 for casting. Benicio del Toro is a good actor, despite portraying a stupid character+2 for the few plot twists",Savages

188,bootsyjam,Nothing groundbreaking here,5,29 October 2020,"It's a drug cartel film that doesn't do anything spectacular. Competent story and set up, albeit with classic ""why the hell would you do that"" actions which occur at key moments to make sure the plot 'works.' I call this an airplane film. You'd watch it on a plane to pass the time. And that's it. It's just....there.On a side note, I have a theory that film stars end up portraying characters that they think are them in real life. Think Tom Cruise and his characters who are always experts and way ahead of normal people and act with supreme confidence knowing that their actions are correct.And this film gives us Salma Hayek playing a character that has certain personality traits/power status.

It is a constant struggle between money, staying safe, and the future. Both of the young men have very different ideals on how to obtain this and what they want from their futures.

190,filmcritic3,"Stone slips on SAVAGES, salvages style",5,5 July 2012,"SAVAGESOliver Stone's films are complicated and often difficult to digest. I brought several guests to the press screening of his latest film SAVAGES and afterwords asked them what they thought. Both said they were still thinking about it. Something happened, but it's not the immediate gratifying sensation generally provided by most films. I do know this, I'm glad I saw the film, but the only reason I might watch it again is to see Salma Hayek. She is an amazing woman who seems to be more seductive and exotic as she matures. In SAVAGES, she is manic, bouncing from ruthless drug lord to pathetic parent in the blink of an eye. It's the type of performance that could garner Best Supporting Actress nods.So, as I digest Stone's SAVAGES over my morning cup of Joe, allow me to share a few observations. First, like many Stone works, SAVAGES is too long. Clocking in at 2 hours and 15 minutes, this tale could easily be contained in 90 minutes. Blame Editors Joe Hutshing, Stuart Levy and Alex Marquez for dragging the tale out and causing lulling gaps in the sequencing.On the other hand, Cinematographer Dan Mindel made me feel quite at home. He incorporates shots and SFX techniques, like graining, posterization, racking focus and sepia, which were part and parcel of shooting in the 70's and 80's. The style did nothing for the tale, though the shots did help the slow parts, but they did bring back fond memories of my camera wielding days. Mindel's close ups of Benicio Del Toro, as Lado, are also very effective in presenting him as a psycho, demented nefarious no-good.The subtle messages Stone delivers, as he always does, are conflicting. He establishes the Mexican culture as superior to American culture. This is evidenced in Elana's (Hayek) first discussion with O, played by Blake Lively. Her contempt for O's whining is apparent, though O is channeling the air-headed mantras of the Net Generation. Sexual mores are called into question. The Mexicans, though the antagonists as murderers, rapists and drug smugglers present an almost Puritanical view on sexual relations. They may murder and rape, but they immediately bless themselves and pray for forgiveness afterwords. Meanwhile, the Americans are presented as a Hugh Hefner hedonistic sexual miscarriage. Here again, the Mexican culture is utilized to lambaste the liberal tomes.Finally, seeing the two cultures clash in this fashion, Stone imparts a searing warning to close our borders and prevent America's invasion by Mexicans, whether legal or illegal. While the folks in Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada and California may all agree with this sentiment, apparently the Supreme Court doesn't.KEY SCENES TO LOOK FOR: 1. THE FIRST ROBBERY 2. THE FIRST ATTACK 3. THE FLARE SEQUENCE The final message Stone delivers with authority is a version of Woody Harrelson's ""nut up or shut up"". Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson play Chon and Ben respectively, two polar opposites who are best friends. They enter the drug business when their college dreams of success fall though. Ben is the pacifist, Chon the aggressor. Repeatedly in the film, Stone delivers the message that following the pacifist way leads to destruction and death, while the more prudent and ultimately safer method, would always be Chon's. Imagine if Chon's team would have executed their plan during the first hotel meeting. The result would have been a totally different story, maybe the script for Expendables 3.Salma is Elana , a Mexican drug lord fallen on hard times. She is under attack by a strong competitor, her operation is crippled by DEA agents who seem to have inside info into her procedures and she cannot produce the quality product Ben and Chon do. As a result, she decides to take over their production method and distribution routes in a most aggressive manner.Stone can either be complete genius (Natural Born Killers) or boring soap box preacher (JFK). With SAVAGES, he is nestled in mid-ground. An absolutely insipid monologue by O in the film's final reel, trivializes all that precedes it. It's one sequence that should have been cut to avoid the WTF comments as the credits roll. SAVAGES is worth a look for the camera-work and for Salma, but unless you're a hardcore Stone fan, the price of admission may be too high for this one. Sounds like VOD or DVD rental is a much better avenue.THE RATING FOR SAVAGES = C-30-Fiore Mastracci is Pittsburgh's longest running film critic and has been secretly in love with Salma Hayek since a press conference held in 1990.",Savages
191,ThePadraigMoista,"An entertaining 130 minutes. However, doesn't match the likes of The Departed.",7,21 September 2012,"The last thing Oliver Stone directed was Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps in 2010. The last good thing he directed was Natural Born Killers in 1994. Of course, his recent films are defiantly not anything to go by, considering all the films leading up to Natural Born Killers were great. But, 12 years later, he has made another good film. And hopefully this will restart his downhill career. Savages stars John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro, Salma Hayek, Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Blake Lively. A decent cast, the only real stand-out is Del Toro, who delivers a great performance once again and as always. The rest of the cast however, are mediocre at best.I thought the premise was a bit silly and unrealistic and the annoying thing is that it doesn't give you any indication to whether it is trying to be silly and unrealistic or whether it's not. Because at times I was thinking, ""well, yeah, I suppose that is pretty realistic."" But other times the dialog and whole scenarios just seem too unrealistic and way over-the-top. Sure, there are a few plot holes. And sure, it is a bit predictable at times. But I was enjoying my time watching the film and a few scenes are memorable. Most of them, if not all, include Benicio Del Toro. I'm going to say that the film wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. It wasn't trying to emulate the feel of a great gangster film like Goodfellas or The Departed. It was just meant for an entertaining 130 minutes. And in that aspect, it succeeds.But my main complaint, would most defiantly have to be ending. I know, everyone is complaining about the ending and I am too. Even when it happened, a person behind me said, ""ah for God's sake."" And I'd have to agree. But it doesn't take away from the fact that the film is entertaining, very well directed and has a great performance from Benicio. However, it is nothing ground-breaking. A solid 7/10",Savages
192,xThe_Fury,Savages - A Review by Brandon Krzysztof,8,3 July 2012,"""Savages"" is a thriller filled with the feel of past Oliver Stone films  that Stone himself wants to get the audience used to again. Using  blood, gore, and intense action sequences; ""Savages"" wants to give you  a feel that hasn't been present in many movies this summer. Now let's  see if Oliver Stone can regain his former glory and make another cult  classic.  Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) are together one of the  biggest marijuana dealers in Laguna Beach, California. When a Mexican  cartel, led by Elena (Salma Hayek), wants to expand their business  upward and offer Ben and Chon a deal, they reject and this forces Elena  to send her right hand man Lado (Benicio Del Toro) to kidnap their  shared girlfriend, O (Blake Lively). Upon hearing this Ben and Chon  agree to comply; but instead with intel from DEA agent Dennis (John  Travolta), they concoct a plan to rescue you O and get the cartel off  their backs for good.  First of all, the tone of the film clearly set in the beginning of the  movie in the very first scene. It gave you since of what the movie is  going to be like and also how gruesome it is going to be. The pacing of  the film was great, moved from scene to scene well and there wasn't any  scenes that slowed it done. It had a nice steady pace with the perfect  fix of action and dramatic scenes. Oliver Stone's close ups during  really emotional scenes were great, the whole shot would be the actors  face and it really got you invested in that character during the close-  up. The acting was pretty good for the most part. Kitsch, Johnson,  Travolta, Hayek were really good; but Benicio Del Toro was brilliant.  Blake Lively improved in this film, but sometimes her dialogue was  really hard to watch.  Overall I enjoyed this film a lot. The acting was good, the writing was  good, and Oliver Stone's take on this story was good. I'm glad to see  him go back to vintage Oliver Stone. I do recommend that people see  this film. It's really good. Aaron Johnson, Taylor Kitsch and Del Toro  are really worth the price of admission and the movie is, lack of a  better word, bad ass.  4 out of 5 stars.",Savages
193,Convictions,"It's messy, but an entertaining mess",7,13 February 2013,"I haven't seen that many Oliver Stone movies so for those of you who are fans of him I can't say how this compares to his other works. I will say however, that this is a big improvement over his last movie Wall Street 2 which was a complete bore to me. This has both critics and people divided so I can't say if you might enjoy this or not but, if your looking for something groundbreaking, you won't find it here.As much as I enjoyed this, there is nothing new you haven't seen before. This is your typical run-of-the-mill revenge flick but, it's the visual style and twists along the way that set it apart from most films in this genre. However, there are some bumps along the way. The first is Blake Lively. Personally, I don't find her to be a bad actress like so many people have but, her performance here isn't all that good and she hardly has any chemistry with her two male co-stars. This was a problem because they are, after all, fighting to get her back. The next thing is, sometimes during the movie it becomes unnecessarily convoluted, especially the beginning monologue from Blake Lively's character. Sure, it was clever but, it was so complex and it felt like it didn't fit with the movie. This reminded me of last year's Contraband where it had a simple story but they made it so convoluted for no reason. It's not as bad here but, there are times when it becomes hard to follow. Lastly, is the ending. This took me by surprise, I never read the book so I'm not sure if it ended the same way but, you'll either love it or hate it. I'm in the middle, it's no where near as bad as some people make it out to be but, on the other hand it could have done away with the violence. No, it's not that I can't handle violence or anything it's just, to explain the ending in greater detail would ruin it for some. Once you've seen it you'll understand. Other than these issues everything is was fine.With the exception of Lively, the rest of the cast was good. Benicio Del Toro and Salma Hayek were the stand outs in my opinion. Even though there was hardly and chemistry between Lively and her male co-stars, Kitsch and Johnson share the nice buddy chemistry that's surprisingly lacking in many films today. Though I wasn't rooting for them to get Lively back, I was rooting for them to get out of this mess.Most of the character's are surprisingly well-developed, don't get me wrong they're not 3-dimensional character's but, they're well-developed enough for me to care about them. Like I said, I didn't care for Lively's character but, I think that has to do with her performance rather than the character itself. Even though Hayke is bad here, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for her as she loves her kids and she tries to keep them hidden for their own protection because of who she is but, they don't want anything to do with her even though she desperately wants to talk and see them all the time.The movie is nicely-shot so no need to worry about the shaky-cam during the intense action sequences. We're also treated to some beautiful shots of California along the coast. The type of music for this kind of movie seems like it should be the heavy metal variety but, thankfully it's not. The music is nice and adds a nice touch throughout the movie.Overall, this isn't a perfect movie. Blake Lively is a miscast, there's no chemistry between her and her two male counterparts, and the ending is a little disappointing. It's also more complex, which isn't a bad thing of course, but it doesn't fit well with something that's this straightforward and has a story as generic as this. Everything else is great, the performances from the rest of the cast, the action, the violence etc. This is a perfect movie for us adults and if you having nothing to do I'd definitely recommend this movie. Sure, it's messy but, it's entertaining and much better than a handful of movies within it's genre.",Savages

The trailers for this movie were not the interesting to me which made me not want to go see the film. I am glad I decided to still go and see it because I was pleasantly entertained. This film stars Aaron Johnson (Kick-ass, The Illusionist), Taylor Kitsch (Battleship, John Carter), Blake Lively (The Town, Green Lantern), Benicio Del Toro (Snatch, The Usual Suspects), John Travolta (Pulp Fiction, Face/Off), and Salma Hayek (Frida, Desperado).Best friends Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) work together and sell the best pot there is. They also both share a girl, O (Blake Lively), who they both love equally and don't mind that they both have her. A Mexican drug cartel starts to move north and wants to partner up with Ben and Chon's methods and will not take no for an answer. Once they turn down the order, the cartel kidnaps O and forces Ben and Chon to work for them, but they have a plan to try and get her back.I honestly really liked this movie because it was not what I was expecting going in to it. This film surprised me with every twist and turn it throws at you. When the action scenes came the were well done and very brutal, which is something I really enjoyed. I thought for the most part everyone did a good job at acting, there were just a few who couldn't make me believe their character and you can obviously tell who they are when you watch the film. The one major problem with the film that really disappointed me was the ending. They tried to pull a bait and switch and if they didn't do that then the film would have been better how it should have originally ended. If you have an interest in seeing the film then I suggest you do so, it was fun to watch and had some really awesome action scenes.

197,simplisticreviewsblogspo,A Savage cop out,6,31 January 2013,"Review by Matt:There are times when a film comes around that you hear about, wait to see it, finally see it, are extremely pleased with the results, but come the end of the movie you're thinking to yourself, ""What just happened?"" That's the film ""Savages,"" where come the end of the film, or what you think is the end of the film, you scream out, ""C'MON!""When you think about Oliver Stone you have to think about the amount of directors that he's influenced; I would bet one American dollar that there isn't a director, living or dead, that would say they weren't influenced by either the writing or directing talents of Stone. He uses spiritual imagery in an effective way, loves to show sex and violence, but there is still a tongue-in-cheek element when he goes to the extreme, especially in his post-""Platoon"" work. Lately he's had his ups-and-downs, trying to cash in on old ideas (""Wall Street""), but when ""Savages"" was announced I was a little excited. It looked and felt like old-school Stone, circa ""Natural Born Killers."" Gritty, bloody, sexy, and violent. Even the cast was young and hip. So why was ""Savages"" a let down? Let's take a walk.""Savages"" stars Blake Lively as O, or Ophelia, who is ""shared"" by two independent pot growers/sellers, played by Aaron Johnson and ""Mr. Chicken Burrito"" himself, Taylor Kitsch. Everything is going swimmingly for the three until they turn down a request from Baja Cartel Mistress, Elena. Things go from bad to worse for the three as they find themselves at war with the Cartel. The violence is brutal at times, but what would you expect from a vicious Mexican Cartel. Just read or listen to the news and I'm sure you'll read, or hear, much worse.Lively is the backbone of this film, and rightfully so. I think she kind of gets a raw deal in Hollywood due to her ""Gossip Girl"" ties, but she holds her own in ""Savages"" and gives a pitch-perfect performance of a girl who is both the ""damsel in distress"" and the ""strong heroine."" If you want to see Lively in another good performance check out ""The Town."" For someone who you would take a quick glance at and write her off as just eye-candy, she can act, and takes chances. We need more Blake Livelys and less Brooklyn Deckers and whoever that girl is who can't close her mouth in ""Transformers 3.""The plot twists and turns and keeps you on your toes throughout. You really never know who is the next person to get killed or get caught in the crossfire, and the stakes are pretty high throughout the film. That is until the ""end."" If Stone had more balls he would have ended the film ten minutes earlier. The ""end"" is what you would have expected the whole film, but I guess that's the whole point. You expect something Shakespearean, but you get a curveball that really makes you say, once again, ""C'MON!"" Like ""Hamlet"" you expect a tragedy, and you get close, but I of course won't spoil the fun, because all in all ""Savages"" is actually the best Oliver Stone film since probably ""Killers"" or I might even go as new as ""Any Given Sunday.""The one thing you'll take away from ""Savages"" is that Stone still has it. He can still make a film just as visceral as he did in his younger days. After years of dealing with George W Bush, September 11th, and going back to ""Wall Street"" there was a question as to whether Stone wanted to deal with darker subject matter.

Unfortunately the movie really portrays savages: three young major leads that show savagely bad performance as actors and as humans here.Well - the good news about the movie is: there are also three mega-great actors in it: Travolta, Hayek and DelTorro! Do they function as some sort of counter-caricature to the three young ""savage actors""? I really don't know, but they're the three stars I would give in this case.What the seven missing stars are: three lead actors without character, bad lead acting, shallow entertainment with no deeper sense or meaning at all, a more or less stupid story, senseless violence, anachronistic ""revenge"" ideology (who kills wins?), the idiotic Blake-Lively-remarks.Why did Stone fail to make a good movie? That's the main question this one poses. Even though one is momentarily reminded of Tarantino - formally and technically SAVAGES is well made (camerawork etc.) - but from the point of view of content it is worth nothing.Was it Stone's fault that the script is just perfect emptiness, or why did he take the Winslow novel? I guess the error lies already in the writing, in the story itself. No wonder that NATURAL BORN KILLERS - written by Tarantino (!) - became THE Stone hit! Obviously times bygone...",Savages
199,ttron2000,"great, but not for everybody",10,9 July 2012,"i'm a huge oliver stone fan. aside from wall street 2 and Alexander, i love the work this man does. he's a master filmmaker. savages shows me he hasn't lost its edge. i read the book and it's very quick and vulgar read. i thought it was awesome, so i was eagerly excited for the movie. there were some changes, most of them positive, but the film follows the source material very closely. two pot-growers/dealers, Chon (taylor kitsch), a former SEAL, now volatile and aggressive, and Ben (aaron Johnson), a business-minded botanist without a violent bone in his body, share the same girlfriend, the lovely and flighty o (blake lively). they live the high life and life is good until the baja cartel, run by Elena (selma hayek) want a piece of chon and Ben's business, specifically their designer hydro that's more pure than anything on the market. chon and Ben aren't interested, so Elena has her vicious henchman, lado (benicio del toro) kidnap o, forcing Chon and Ben to comply. it isn't long before Chon and Ben go to extenuating and violent measures to rescue o. what follows is a well-acted, beautifully shot, and blood-drenched film that with all things considered is an absolute blast. i've never been a fan of kitsch, but he turned me around with this one, giving a relaxed performance to a hot-headed character. Johnson, kick-ass himself, is excellent, going from decent pacifist to scared gunmen when pushed too far. hayek is great as well, especially in a scene toward the end when chon and Ben turn the tables on her. but the VIPs of this bad boy are del toro and john travolta (as a crooked DEA agent), as cruel madman and desperate dipshit respectively. an electric scene between the two of them made the movie for me and would've made me love it even if it was total crap. the movie's not perfect. lively is stunning, but quite bland, especially given the caliber of bad ass she shares the screen with. and the end takes a left turn (different from the book) which i didn't hate, but it definitely took away a bit of the story's emotional core. even with that, it's pretty great. stone goes more the natural born killers/u-turn route here, telling a regular story while not pushing any political or world view themes. it's just a normal (albeit violent) film. it's stunning to look at, highlighting lush shots of the beach, and action that's tense and brutal, but it's not as jumpy or erratically edited as films like JFK or natural born killers (though as a huge stone fan, i totally dig that). the violence and the sexual relationship between the three protagonists (the movie's not really steamy) may turn the squeamish away, but stone fans are sure to dig it. overall, i'd recommend it to anyone and be eager to disagree with any naysayers. i loved it.",Savages

The love story between the two guys and the girl was not believable, as no background was provided.m, so it is just weird.Benicio Del Toro is great as always.

203,emmajanegray1985,All star cast from stone didn't disappoint,7,17 February 2013,"Aside from the questionable love triangle relationship this film did entertain. An all star cast from Oliver Stone who pulled in some heavy weights to play main characters; Travolta, Heyek, Del Toro. The story line follows the usual route of a film about drugs, a cartel and what happens when something goes wrong.It reminded me slightly of the beach in the bohemian sense that it is filmed with the beautiful locations and equally beautiful cast members.My only criticism if I had to find one is Blake lively is entirely wooden and seems only able to play herself, but I guess she wasn't cast for her acting skills.

It may seem difficult to the common person to understand the dealings of the drug world, personally, I'm not sure how 'pot' is grown and distributed throughout the world, but that's not important to me when watching this movie. It's a movie, and in this, boundaries are set, and I believe that in this movie world, the story fits well. Of course, if someone has a problem with a woman being with two different men or two guys selling drugs to make a living, then they may reject the movie for personal or moral reasons. However, when I view a movie, I try to enter its world of probability or belief. With that said, I truly enjoyed the movie. It did its job in laying the tracks and the players that were there for the ride. Thought Travolta was spot on with his performance along with Benecio Del Toro, along with the rest of the cast. There was no weak link as far as I could see. Had to laugh at the alternate ending sequence, truly caught me off guard. As always, Oliver Stone delivers.",Savages
206,Jay-Klee,Longing for the Oliver Stone of the past...,3,28 December 2012,"When I first saw Savages pop up on the radar, I was stoked. A story about two guys going up against the Mexican cartel, directed by Oliver Stone? Sounds awesome. Once I saw that Emile Hirsch was cast, I was all in (for some reason, I'll see anything the guy is in). Well...did it live up to the hype? Savages is one of the most poorly written screenplays I have ever had the pleasure of watching unfold on screen. The dialog is laughable, and none of the characters have any traits that an audience member would want to latch on to. One of the bits of dialog, right in the first five minutes of the film, says something to the effect of ""I have orgasms, he has wargasms."" Sounds like something that a tenth grader would write in the first draft of a dramatic short story. The acting is just about the same caliber.There's one action scene that was well done, but it was short and, well...too little, too late. This train wreck doesn't even end in a satisfying way.Avoid this mess. What was Oliver Stone thinking?",Savages

The thing that is flick so good is, BENICIO DEL TORO as he did some 2 levels above acting and made this ordinary movie, extra ordinary. It cant be an award winner sort of a flick but yes, Del Toro's acting does deserve few acting awards as He proved himself yet again. Few other actors also did well, like Salma Hayek portrayed the character of a divorced Drug business owner with a softer side as a Mother of a daughter. The other famous actor John Travolta is also there, but I dint really like his role that much as He become so monotonous.

210,dudemark,Just watched it!... And now I want to punch a baby.,2,26 November 2012,"Incredible awful piece of film. I was coerced into watching this by my girlfriend who is obsessed with Blake from a TV show she likes, so its not like I went into this with high expectations. But this garbage managed to drop beyond the depths of low expectations into abysses usually reserved for movies starring Colin Farrell or that British guy who invents lies. That having been said, I want to lead into this by telling you to not take my word for it, see this movie for yourself. Just utilize the buddy system when watching and make sure you take turns checking each-other's vitals and be prepared to administer hypodermics of adrenaline to keep the old hearts pumping steady. Right off the bat I was driven nuts by the terribly written prologue voice-over which was trying so hard to be profound, but really came off just obscene. I mean we are talking some of the worst writing that has made its way to the box office. Spoiler alert: within the first ninety seconds of the movie you will get to hear Blake Lively say ""I have orgasms... He has wargasms..."" I would like to think that the writers lost a bet or something, but I digress. Well this nonsense continues on through the entire movie! Its like they had this movie made and someone was like ""I don't think Blake Lively is ruining this project enough yet, can we have her talk even when she's not in the scene?"".Okay and one other thing... You mean to tell me that after all of the previews (which were basically the prologue minus the wargasm comment) eluding to some pretty intense sex scenes, we are not even going to see Blake nude? What the hell is this bull crap? That would have justified her place in that movie at least a little bit, and I would have found it easily to forgive the infuriating stupidity that her character portrayed through the next two and a half hours.That's right, did I mention that this movie was over two hours long? So for over a twelfth of my day, I had to watch this utterly unbelievable story play out about two guys sharing a girl that they both loved and then basically trying to get her back. There was about a 50 minute part about 60% through where I felt like the characters themselves didn't know what was going on in the story. Finally, the two guys in the movie? Taylor Kitsch and the other one? Did someone even tell them that they were supposed to be pretending to be other people? I have never been so bored watching people's mouths move and then hearing words fall out in my life. Never.I give this 2 out of 10 because they spent a lot of money on it.",Savages
211,fwhill,Fabulous Adult character study,10,15 September 2012,"This movie catapults Oliver Stone back to the top in his profession, just like Platoon did. The story line from an excellent novel is brought to the screen with beautiful cinematography. Relatively new faces (Blake Lively, Taylor Kitsch & Aaron Johnson) are nicely interwoven with stalwarts (Benito Del Toro, John Travolta and Salma Hayek).The basic plot involves a former Navy Seal and Botanist who develop a very high THC marijuana from seeds brought into the US from Afghanistan. Their dope is the best, maybe in the world, which is one of the reasons a Mexican Cartel, headed by a woman, want to take them over. The duo share a girl friend, O, which makes for very unusual and interesting interaction when the three of them get together. The manner in which they handle conflict is also interesting--- Aaron is peace and love, Chon is shoot the mother-------!. Then events cause them to change their approach to violence, threats and love. Whether you read the book and see the movie, or see the movie first, I wholeheartedly recommend both.",Savages
212,gattler,Much worse than 6.7,1,5 November 2012,"Oliver Stone delivered a lot of fine movies like Wall Street. His bold Camera and Storytelling will remain forever part of Hollywood. This movie certainly is different. There is an alternate ending. Voice-Over. Bad lead actors, for instance the Woman, she is really bad. Del Torro is excellent as usual and the scene with Travolta was one of the better parts of the movie. However the unnecessary violence, gruesome and rich in detail, ruins the whole movie. Then when you think a cool ending approaches, Stone rewinds the movie and says, ""hey this is not the real ending, we have a much better idea"". That's just a huge faux pas, a major worst case of any movie and makes this movie loose many stars. So skip this one, and if you expect intelligent story-telling about just the same topic, one that sucks you in, watch Breaking Bad. It is way better than this movie.",Savages
213,AustinByrd86,Extremely Overhyped,3,31 May 2021,"I can't believe how many people have recommended this film to me...Two dudes with whom we're expected to be believe are close friends apparently don't know enough about one another to know who should be playing what role and when. They make stupid mistakes constantly throughout the film and, rather than simply taking what's theirs and skipping town, decide to throw it all away for the same spoiled affluent white chick you'll meet in every single corner of California.The narrative is completely absurd. If you have a brain you won't like this film because it simply doesn't make sense on any level. If you're an actual criminal you'll be annoyed constantly by all of the ridiculous choices all of the criminals make.

She played the best character I could ever possibly imagine in the movie and owned it dead on. Her character satisfied me and gave her character a 100% even though she seemed to portray the character of a slut/whore. Later on you'll realize why she isn't a slut or a whore - many people in society need to understand people or a girl like her before they judge. Anyways if you really like a movie with sexual scenes, drugs, war, gore, nudity, and one smokin hot girl.. this movie is for you. Two words: Blake Lively. Enjoy.",Savages
215,ttx-934-579301,A good film with a famous director and several excellent actors,7,4 November 2012,"First of all, don't expect any deeper meaning in the film! Just relax and enjoy the watching. It's a kind of a film you should choose for fun. Since it lasts for more than 2 hours, it is a huge plus how the director (Oliver Stone) keeps the viewers' attention in the plot. In addition to that, all the scenes are visually attractive and rather dynamic. There are few weak points in the plot, but they were probably designed so that viewers would sympathize with the characters more easily, which is especially evident with Ben and his volunteer work in the third-world countries. How else would anyone support a drug dealer in the film? In my opinion, the weakest link of ""Savages"" is Blake Lively, whose appearance seems slightly pale, but maybe it's because she was surrounded by actors who played really excellent and memorable roles, and here I'm talking about Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro in the first place, although other actors were good, too.",Savages

I could start by saying that amazing though the cast is, the plot needed a little more work especially as I thought that the ending was a big let-down from all the build-up prior to.Ben(Aaron Taylor –Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) are two pot dealers, friends since kindergarten who share two loves, a craving for the herb and an adoration for 'O' (Blake Lively) a feisty, gorgeous blonde who's in love with both of them (they don't mind) when a Mexican Cartel moves into their territory and demands an alliance both men are forced to reconsider their future and prioritize their goals, but all those plans get thrown out of the window the minute O gets kidnapped.The duo will do anything to get her back and Ben a world roving philanthropist is forced to sink to depths of violence and savagery he'd never thought existed while Chon an ex marine is only too willing to go on a crusade of blood filled vengeance.My award for best performance will however go to Elena (Salam Hayek) and Lado (Benicio del Toro) as the Brutal and psychopathic cartel boss and her blood thirsty hatchet man.

217,marcshank-388-582372,Nobody was going to make a good movie from this book,4,6 January 2014,"This was one of the most exciting books of last year with a style and nuance that knocked you out. The movie did its best to nullify every stylistic point the book made. 1. The casting could not have been worse. 2. Blake Lively's narration was so wrong it was laughable. 3. The dialogue in the movie sort of drained any semblance of credibility from the plot. 4. The direction was confused and uncertain, the exposition nonexistent.In short, this was a very bad movie, book or no book. I think this is Oliver Stone misinterpreting the books themes and intentions. It said he wrote it before it was published. He should have waited for the response from readers who bought it and praised it and maybe he would have been more faithful to it. Somebody ought to do it again because Don Winslow deserves it.",Savages

I thought that the movie was incredible and is definitely one that kept me on the edge of my seat! From the beginning, you get great character knowledge and some back story as to where things are going in the story. The plot line is just amazing! I loved the whole inside look at legal marijuana in California as well as the Mexican cartel portion. Some parts of this movie were absolutely terrifying! And some were quite heart warming.. Overall, it was just a great mix that really kept me entertained the entire way through! I've always been an Oliver Stone junky and he really nailed this one to the wall. I created an account just because I looked up this movie and saw that it's rating was under a 7! The problem with IMDb is right here, people writing their opinions unknowingly persuading someone else to not go out and see an awesome movie. People - if you haven't seen this, it is definitely worth your time and money, at the very least, you will be entertained. With all of the new movies coming out and worthless remakes appearing everywhere, this movie restored some of my faith in Hollywood. Lastly, I thought the cast was brilliant!

220,ferenc_molnar,Gaudy crime drama that isn't fun enough,6,3 July 2012,"Stone has made a gaudy crime drama that meanders around for much of its first hour and then springs into action during the second. The film does get better as it goes on but it's not much fun. There is a good deal of suspense that borrows from the sexual-sadistic thrills of films like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"". It's true that Mexican drug cartels employ techniques of persuasion that make films like ""Hostel"" look pretty tame by comparison. But the suspense in ""Savages"" could use a little more seduction and a lot less visual shocks and jolting sound fx to keep its audience engaged. There are enjoyments to be had in Stone's film, mostly from Salma Hayek, Benicio Del Toro and John Travolta's different takes on the human foibles of adult corruption. Hayek and Del Toro are particularly good and a pleasure to watch. The three younger actors, Kitsch, Johnson and Lively are lovely ciphers. The screenplay includes enough of Winslow's novel to give the story some writerly dimension and humor. Stone's contribution appears to have been in illustrating the fragments of Winslow's novel in dazzling, sensual and gaudy camera work and staging.",Savages
221,callejaiglesias,"Not recommended for anyone, it is a shame.",1,26 January 2013,"This film is in my opinion a total disappointment, starting with Oliver Stone, i wonder if he is in economic problems and needed fast incomes, i can't find any other explanation. The story should be treated with maximum care but is the opposite, it is a a bad mix of violence with ""no consequences"" and away from reality, luxurious and empty display of absurd and once again far from reality lifestyles, trivialization of lethal topics that finally give to poor brains a delusive and dangerous impression .Main roles are not credible at all, even if Mr. Stone wanted them not to be credible. It is a continuous disaster, the relationship between two American friends (one with the cliché of the tough ex-marine with no fear -and no brain-, the other with the cliché of the peaceful, tolerant, traveler, east influenced, open minded, etc -but once again totally empty and hollow character-) and the stupid plastic girl is absolutely insulting . What could be said about Mexican cartel and torture roles?, what about the stupid role of Shalma Hayek?....nothing in this movie has a meaning and i find dangerous to show this movie to the mainstream, it can make a real damage in certain people and definitely trivialize violence in a despicable way.Not anything is valid, guns, bombs, blood, explosions, new technology, luxury, plastic sex,....is thrown against us with the worst taste and no care.",Savages
222,kubpink,Stone ages,4,31 January 2013,"I do not often comment on IMDb, but as I am writing these lines, I realize that each time I did I was really disappointed with what I just watched. This time, Savages made me commit this.I like Stone's work, not all of it, I won't cite all his titles I like. I think he is very pertinent in his storytelling, and he often delivers in his filmmaking a high level of craftsmanship. Savages had none of both, in fact, it is to me an example of what not to do unless you're reaching failure.Apart from the fact that I was not interested in this little world of dope , I just could not think for at least a second its characters could be true. They are impossible to identify with. The plot and these people are just boring and were just badly written.This was not helped by the acting. Blake Lively and Taylor Kitsh are just awful, annoying. Aaron Johnson is lost and has the charisma of Swiss-German bratwurst. Salma Hayek is probably the worst : do you see her as a Mexican hysterical female drug lord wearing a wig ? No you don't if you haven't seen this film, but please do not feel obliged to. Del Toro and Travolta deserve credit though, because they kinda struggle to raise the level in the middle of this mess.I do not know what Stone aimed at, but what I am sure of is he tried to mix to many topics that can't link together : love, friendship, dope, quest for paradise (identity ?), West Coast way of life, parents-children relationships, American-Mexican interdependencies (xenophobia ?), corruption, business, war, chaos, youth... Maybe he wanted to make a best of his previous work, but in the end, we just don't care.Stone usually has an intention ahead of its time. This time Stone is lagging behind I think.",Savages

It's very Oliver Stone, meaning: huge cast, gruesome violence, nudity, drugs, the whole bit. He returned to his Natural Born Killers days, which is what the general movie buff was looking forward to. However, the movie wasn't something I would watch twice. I found the ending to be a little abrupt and horrible. Also, Blake Lively narrating the entire time was getting on my nerves. Taylor Kitsch's performance was good, Travolta was good, Del Toro sold it (as usual), but the movie itself was disappointing. I think they could have found a better performance from many talented actresses to play O, Lively wasn't horrible, but she wasn't strong enough. I loved some of the dutch angles Stone was using, and the overall look of the film: very stylized saturated 90s look. I read the book by Don Winslow and I would've preferred that ending, but I didn't even find the book to be good, or better. Both of them are rated at a C+ for me.",Savages

The worst thing about this movie is the critics which gave this movie such terrible reviews. This movie has it all. Great directing, writing, cinematography, great actors and much suspense. I was nervous all throughout the movie. I felt as if I was in front of the savages from the drug cartel. It's not your typical movie you're used to seeing from Oliver Stone. This movie was part Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Oliver Stone has stepped out of his comfort zone and took a risk at something out of the ordinary. I loved the movie. All of it. If you are a normal person and like adult content movies that include, hot beautiful talented actors, drugs, sex, violence and gore, you will love it too. If you love it like I did, please write a review. It's easy to register and get a free account with IMDb. I would like to see the average stars between 8 and 9.

What captured my attention was Oliver Stone, and he was the fellow responsible for my viewing.Blake Lively, not so lively, I think she was trying to portray a dead fish in this film, at least that's what I got out of her acting skills (could easily replace the T with an H in acting and make it aching). She's really hot though, so I guess that would make her an attractive dead fish. The rest of the cast did a pretty solid job though. Benicio Del Toro was fantastic. Travolta was top notch as usual. The movie had a nice touch of violence, drama and some comedy. In my opinion, a lot of parts were pretty slow and boring. So, if you were to replace all (or most of) the drama/slow parts (and Blake Lively) with comedy (a more talented actress, Natalie Portman?!), and make the whole film into a satire/dark action comedy it would have been one of the greatest movies ever made. Hands down. Damn.7 out of 10, lost 3 stars in the lack of comedy, Blake Lively, and the slow parts.

He is fabulous and captivating when he is on camera, his scene with John Travolta-he controls the entire mood of. This film directed by Oliver Stone, here he shows that he still has what it takes to make a movie work-there are some incredibly tense moments in this film that had another director filmed those scenes they would have fallen apart. There is a scene where Ben is forced to ""finish what he started"" and for us we get close ups of the faces, they are in the working process of working with the Mexican drug cartels, we are their witnesses.Ben & Chon are the biggest pot growers in California with their girlfriend O, yes they both are with her. She explains that to us in a narration that is very well orchestrated from the start. Trust me when I say this is not an easy film to sit through there are some instances where I was nervous and tense, but if you like movies about corrupt cops, drug deals gone bad, kidnapping and many other things-then I think you found your movie.

However had I not known it was made by Oliver Stone, I would not have had such high expectations. I expected a lot more from the man who brought us such gems as Reservoir Dogs, Platoon and Natural Born Killers. This would not be one that I would hold up against those in comparison as it would be trampled by it's brethren. Either Olly is trying to fit in with the new changing world, or he's gone soft in his old age. This lacked depth, which may have helped the ridiculous story line and lackluster casting. While some great casting was made in certain roles, Benecio Del Toro is fabulous as always, extra creepy in this one, (but the hair is a bit over the top), Salma Hayak is great as the ruthless villain, however John Travolta doesn't turn in his best performance. *Spoiler alert* The ending confused me, and I did not like the dual ending approach. Neither ending that he proposed is one that I expected out of Stone, and neither one left me feeling satisfied. There were some great moments of grit and reality of the drug-fueled violence that is plaguing Mexico, but the movie could have been done much better. Overall I'm glad I waited for it to come out on DVD to watch it, and while I was entertained, I feel let down by Oliver Stone.",Savages

I revoke this question delivered by Maximus (Russel Crowe)in Gladiator, because if you are disappointed by this film then that reflects greatly on your perception, or lack of looking into the film before you watch it.Savages is well made and has many strengths along with some weaknesses. The movie starts as the trailer does, O (Blake Lively) is telling us she may or may not be alive at the end of this story. Soon after we are introduced to her ""boys"". We learn that Chon (Taylor Kitsch) is an veteran from the Iraq war and he is a ""killer"". Next comes the other half Ben (Aaron Johnson). I say other half because O describes the two individuals as her one man.No time is wasted to getting to the conflict of this story. A Mexican drug cartel are introduced with their savagery and eloquence juxtaposed. First we see them as murderous savages who cut off people's heads with chainsaws. But once Ben and Chon go to the meeting with the cartel after receiving their video threat, we see a different side of this cartel. The men representing their boss are eloquent, articulate and seemingly aggressive businessmen. It's clear that Ben and Chon have to work with the Cartel or disappear. They choose the latter but of course O is kidnapped before they can disappear.O is kidnapped on the order given by Elena (Selma Hayek) the leader, with the plan to stronghold the pot dealers into doing business with her. Selma is menacing, strong, but not void of emotion or compassion. Truthfully all the main actors in this film are convincing in their roles. Benicio Del Toro (Lado) is great as usual and is most villainous in this film. Travolta plays no saint either, being a corrupt DEA agent playing many angles. Travolta does a good job of playing this character that is more mysterious than you would guess. What you can guess is this movie is pretty action packed, along with decently thrilling. As I said before this movie is clearly made by an expert. There were some interesting motifs. One being the grim reaper, and death related art. Which is an obvious choice considering the display of death and it being apart of Mexican culture. Another being canted shots, which I found effective with the overall themes and moods of the film. Overall the pacing of the film was very effective for the action and thrill of the film. But for the other aspects of the film I found the rhythm and just how the overall way everything was handled to be less effective and off putting. For example the sex scenes and moments of calm(well calm for this movie anyways).However there is value in this film beyond the action and thrill. Which is again due in no small part to Oliver Stone's skill. This movie is well made and the makers most likely made exactly what they intended to. That is to say the targeted demographic is given exactly what they grave. So if you have seen the trailer and it seems like your kind of movie, it probably is and you will most likely enjoy it.",Savages
231,Tyler-Raine,"""There's something wrong with your love story, baby...""",8,9 July 2012,"I enjoyed this immensely. In fact, I thought it was freaking awesome and it is probably my favorite film of 2012. Oliver Stone is back on point with this, and the cast did a stellar job- sans Travolta- Jesus Christ, that guy is a hack! My favorite performance was Salma Hayek. She looked like she was having a lot of fun with the role and I thought it was a cool twist to have a female crime boss. Del Toro obviously was excellent as well, and while the three leads didn't quite stack up to the Latin bombshell duo of Hayek/Del Toro, they held their own. Some of the dialogue was a bit unnatural at times (i.e. random conversations about Buddha) but I'll let it slide. This was gritty, the 130 minute running time flew by, and I wasn't bored for a second. I know the ending sparked some controversy but I found it to be pretty damn clever. Although the first ending was poetic, Shakespearean, romantic and (although depressing) a real crowd pleaser, it just doesn't always work out that way. Sometimes these people do get busted. So I did enjoy that twist, although it could have been executed better. And maybe I interpreted the ending wrong, but I found the hint of gay subtext to be another interesting spin on the genre, though it was a very underdeveloped plot point between the two characters that could have been explored a little further.8.5/10 (A-)",Savages

233,phil-johnston3-545-892970,Bad/Good Movie,5,3 December 2012,"This movie can be summed up in one word: tensionless. Which is not a word that should come to mind in an action-thriller from the director of JFK and Platoon. The source of the movie's many problems is, as it is with most Hollywood blockbusters, the script. The screenwriters, famous for very little outside of Armageddon (1998) and Shaft (2000), have cobbled together a poorly paced and often downright shallow script which sacrifices character development and consistency for length and the opportunity for Stone to film some explosions and one too many sex scenes with Blake Lively. The audience is never given a protagonist to take the journey with, stuck between Lively who spends the first twenty minutes of the movie explaining who everybody is, and her two boyfriends. Kitsch, of Friday Night Lights fame, looks lost on the big screen and gives an underwhelming performance as the ex-soldier who is haunted by his two tours abroad. Johnson is even sorrier, receiving more screen time than Kitsch and failing completely to capture the free spirited stoner that the role called for. The audience is lead to believe that Ophelia is drawn to them because of their juxtaposition, loving Ben for his tenderness and Chon for his brutality. But the two leading men are indistinguishable halfway through the movie and its apparent that neither of them have the gravitas to carry a movie. Throughout the movie's 130 minute runtime we see both characters make decisions completely out of character and the flat performances rob moments of significant character formation and development of any memorability.Its lucky that Benicio del Toro is as classy an actor as he is, because Savages struggles when he isn't on screen. He is calmly menacing when the heavy handed script allows him to be and Stone lets him off he leash a little. Lado is very at home in the brutality of the cartel and del Toro puts the other actors around him to shame, save perhaps Travolta who brightens up the screen in his few appearances. Hayek gives an admirable but completely forgettable performance as Elena, the head of the cartel, but it's tough to blame her for that considering how poorly the scriptwriters handle the character. What had the potential to be a deeply traumatised woman clinging to all that remained of her family while trying to hold together a drug empire has been diluted down to a few scenes in silky nighties in what is probably the movie's biggest let down.But the movie is not all bad. Stone and cinematographer Dan Mindel (Spy Game, MI:3 and Star Trek) have put together a luxuriously shot movie, appropriately vibrant and easy to watch. Mindel even slips in a lens flare in true Star Trek tradition. Stone's direction is classy and indulgent, but not to the point of being obtuse. The shooting really is one of this movie's strengths.It is ultimately wasted however, on a story that had a lot of potential. The final act renders the middle of the overly-long movie essentially irrelevant as the players come together for the inevitable confrontation. Flat characters acting completely unreasonably interspersed with often garish violence leaves a bad taste in the mouth at the end. We're left with Lively's voice-over telling us that the movie ends exactly how we expected it to end in the first place. The use of this technique jut serves as a jarring reminder that the screenwriters have been too lazy to show instead of tell us the story we just watched, to let he characters evolve holistically in front of us and that the actors didn't have the depth to play these one-dimensional figures we never got the chance to care about.goodbadreviews.wordpress.com",Savages

Anyone would have a tough time uttering this stuff. Travolta, Hayek, and Del Toro carry the film. Really, the only reason I stuck it out was to see their scenes.

235,arbino-man,Could have been great. Too bad about the ending.,1,29 July 2012,"Can two minutes literally drop a movie from a 9 rating to a 2 rating? In this case yes.The movie has a lot going for it. Oliver Stone directing based on Don Winslows book. You got Benicio del Toro in one of his most entertaining performances. Travolta in his best role in years. Even Blake Lively who has gotten a bad rap is actually pretty good in this film. I actually quite enjoyed the film in nearly every aspect.Then the final two minutes happened. SPOILERS ahead. You think the movie is about to end at the most logical point, yet it doesn't, but actually rewinds into a happy dappy ending.I'm not sure what happened. It feels like Universal told Oliver Stone to make sure that the film ends on a happy note in order for the audience to leave on a happy note. It just doesn't work. It's like Stone threw out all logic and all narrative for the sake of a trick ending. I'm sure all the grandma's in the audiences will be happy, but this is a brutal film. It's not supposed to have an ending where everyone holds hands and walks into the sunset. Heroes and villains alike.The ending is a mess beyond logical proportions. It's a heap and a half and literally ruins what could have been a great film. In all honesty, that makes me a bit sad to see a film that could have garnered some cult recognition, ultimately being regulated for the $1 dollar bin at your local Wal-Mart.I'm not sure in Winslow is upset over this, but he should be. It's a slap to the face to all the fans of his book, and to the fans of cinema. Shame on you Stone. Shame on you.",Savages

These other guys sucked.Absolutely no depth to the story.There is some weird love triangle with absolutely no context. Yet we are led to believe that these men are willing to do anything. Literally anything to save this woman.The love triangle takes away a lot from the movie. I lost respect for the characters and found myself wanting them to lose at every turn. We are suppose to believe that 2 young good looking, fit millionaires cannot find more then 1 woman to be in love with. We are also suppose to believe that 2 young, successful, handsome, American white men with a little bit of help are able to evade, out smart and take down and entire cartel on there own for some whore they are in love with. This paragraph sums up the movie.Could have been great with some context to the love story and some more realism.

What the hell? I mean, the movie was very weak to begin with. Mary Jane dealers and the Mexicans (or Colombians or something like that) moving in?

Turning from third-world-Madonna to Danny Trejo and back again? Sure.And Blake Lively... I have yet to see a movie where she deserves the title ""actress"".

239,alevinadresi,Worth watching for Benicio,8,2 March 2017,"I watched the movie after reading many bad comments about it and after having already watched some really good cartel movies. I don't think Oliver Stone wanted to give us a gruesome cartel thriller. Yes, there were some bloody or merciless scenes but they only formed a small portion of the movie and did not distort the general entertaining mood of the movie, which I believe was Oliver Stone's real intention. He threaded it a bit lightly and kept the movie quite entertaining. This is what I would call a laid-back cartel movie that offers you a bit of everything: Love, sex, violence, excitement, revenge. People criticized the young actors too harshly here but that might be caused by their being overshadowed by veteran actors. Come on, how can you keep up with Benicio:) One thing I agree with other reviewers was that there was not any chemistry Ben, Chon and O (Blake) that makes you believe they are actually in love, but didn't it eventually turn out that their love was not real anyway? Oliver made you feel that there was something missing in their relationship from the beginning. Still, when you are finished with the movie, you end up feeling something was missing and that you are not fully satisfied. Yet, what made this movie so special to me was the mind-blowing performance of Benicio Del Toro as Lado. Oh my. He was phenomenal. He looks such a good mannered cool guy in real life that it is so hard to believe he can play such a psycho but he really plays it so well, makes you believe that he is that bad, and makes you love him anyway. It has been a couple of days since I watched the movie, and his scenes keep playing in my mind on a loop. I think this was one of his best performances, and I can watch this movie all over again simply to watch him. But would I rate this movie 8 out 10 without him? Probably not. I would probably give a 5 star if Benicio was not in it. So Kudos to Oliver Stone for giving us one of the most phenomenal bad guys on the silver screen. On a final note, I really loved the colors in this movie. As a foreigner, it made me jump on the first plane to see California. All in all, it is an entertaining movie with some great performances.",Savages

Despite having made Natural Born Killers 20 years ago I figured Oliver Stone would still have enough edge to pull this off. Wrong. The first problem is the film's tone which is all wrong and lacking in style. Though Taylor Kitsch is perfect as Chon and Aaron Johnson is good as Ben, Blake Lively gets O all wrong. Of the entire cast Benecio Del Toro, Salma Hayak, and John Travolta do the best work. No matter though because the script is such a mess. The movie's biggest problem is the ending. I could've forgiven the other shortcomings but not that. First, we get the ""right"" ending (the one from the book where everyone dies) and then Oh! Wait a minute, no that's what O only envisioned happening - here's what really happened : Lado turns everyone in to Dennis and the DEA and everyone lives more or less happily ever after.

250,tubamonkey09,Absolutely awful.,1,10 July 2012,"Oliver Stone has a reputation of excellent film making (Natural Born Killers, Platoon), but what I saw in the movie theater last night was easily one of the worst films I've ever seen in my entire life. First the characters are two dimensional. The two male leads are introduced as basically ""the tough guy"" and the ""sensitive guy"". Their performances were mediocre at best. Taylor Klitsch was dry and brought nothing special to the role. The female lead ""O"" (Blake Lively) seems to have nothing particularly interesting about her, and her voice narrating makes the sound of a root canal suddenly more appetizing. Stone wants the audience to view these three characters as heroes, but I don't see it. The characters don't do anything significant they just grow weed, smoke weed, and have sex. Stone tries to get the audience on our side when he presents the benefits of marijuana but instead it comes across as 20-30 minutes of ""legalize"" propaganda followed by 10 minutes of renewable energy information.Speaking of propaganda, the political and social themes in this movie are about as subtle as prison rape. It seems that instead of making a film about a group of people who live an alternative lifestyle, Stone has created a film about alternative lifestyles featuring some people. Blake Lively narrates a sort of montage of the marijuana industry, where all the minor characters are young, wealthy, and attractive, not to mention that marijuana is portrayed as a lifestyle, dare I say religion. Was this movie supposed to be realistic at some point? I don't know if I should have been eating popcorn in the theater or weaving a hemp bracelet. AHHH but the trailer has guns! It features violence! Well... sort of.... just when you think the movie will redeem itself with some guns blazing action it simply doesn't deliver on this either. There are a few explosions that any high-schooler with an M-80 could pull off in their garage, some CGI blood, and the only good violent scene is so late in the movie that the audience doesn't react. I don't understand where these millions of dollars went because they weren't in this movie, either Oliver Stone is a terrible film maker or an awesome crook. Terrible acting, terrible action, terrible script, absolutely TERRIBLE. Save yourself the aggravation and skip this movie. I haven't been this upset with cinema since Bill Murray did Garfield.

Blake Lively has roughly the same job here as Laguna: look gorgeous enough that you'd understand why these guys love their life and don't want anything to change. That's the problem here: nothing CHANGES, except superficial circumstances. You can sum ""Savages"" up in one sentence: ""Look! The drug trade is violent!"" Who was waiting on that update? Savages sets up some compelling themes - the price of pacifism in a violent world, the the vanity/naiveté that tell us we can ""outsmart"" the consequences of our choices - but DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH with them. In the end, surviving characters seem unfazed and unchanged by their experiences. It's like they laid all the ingredients out, but forgot to cook (insert stoner joke here, I'll wait). ""Blow"" and ""Traffic"" were both more compelling looks at the trade, and for all the promised ""savagery"" of the violence – ""Look! An eyeball!"" – Showtime's ""Dexter"" made the point better (via Dexter's flashbacks to the death of his biological mother). It's hard for me to blame the actors here because they actually WERE engaging enough – especially Benicio Del Toro – that I would have LIKED to see them act out the full story here, and give their characters life – vs. a still life, which is what this movie is.

If you are looking for gone with the wind, sound of the music or something like that best look else where. Me, I highly enjoyed the movie, it delivered better than i thought it was going to deliver. People will complain about the violence but again this is about a Mexican cartel, not the boy scouts. There is nothing i hate more than a movie that isn't true to it's roots, but this movie stays true to what Mexican cartels are all about when it comes to business.",Savages
253,christine_yau,"""Savages"" leaves a little to be desired at certain points, the movie supplies us with a quest for love, acts of betrayal and deceit, and a fair amount of action.",7,17 March 2013,"Instead of reviewing a well-known movie, that I'm sure everyone has seen, I decided to cover ""Savages"", a neat little adventure film that wasn't quite so widely released.The film has an intriguing plot, great cinematography, and is certainly not short of notable acting talent, with John Travolta playing a corrupt DFA agent and Salma Hayek the leader of a notorious Mexican Drug Cartel.This cannabis caper was directed by Oliver Stone – well known for highly-acclaimed movies 'Platoon' and 'Natural Born Killers' – and follows two large scale pot growers (Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Taylor Kitsch, also better remembered as the guys in ""Kick-Ass"" and ""John Carter"" respectively) as they are blackmailed by a nasty Mexican drug cartel.Although the movie is certainly a thriller, it has very romantic elements – we see the rather complex, yet intriguing relationship the two men share with their girlfriend (played by the wonderful Blake Lively), and we even see Salma Hayek, as ""The Red Queen"", receive her own share of the audiences' compassion as she skillfully portrays depth of character.My favorite elements of the movie were Benicio Del Toro's performance (he was entrancing on screen, you could really feel his sleaziness) and the imagery and colors of the movie itself were so mesmerizing!Although the flow of ""Savages"" leaves a little to be desired at certain points, the movie supplies us with a quest for love, acts of betrayal and deceit, and a fair amount of action. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely a must!",Savages
254,tammuz420,This movie is FAKE!,4,7 March 2014,"This movie is fake, from Kesha the valley girl's acting and narrating to Selma Hayaks hair. Even John Travolta couldn't save this lame excuse for a movie. By the end of the movie, I just wanted this dud of movie to be over. I really didn't care what happened to the emotionless actors involved in a love triangle. The storyline is somewhat believable, but often confusing and downright stupid. Im guessing the writers were experimenting with some potent THC, when they wrote this movie about THC.Benicio Del Toro, as cartel hit-man, was pretty bad ass as usual, but often seemed slow and lazy in his performance. Travolta as a whiny sniveling federal agent was good, but seemed lackluster and cameo. Hayak, who I loved in From Dusk til Dawn, and Frida, was rather boring and dull as cartel boss. Then there were the main characters in a love triangle, which really drug this movie down. The blonde girl's performance as a hostage and narrator really killed it for me.Despite some big name actors, and a few redeeming performances, this movie is Hollywoood rubbish, and an insult to the general public.

264,mortenblaabjerg,Good quality grass is a wonderful metaphor for US values,8,28 February 2015,"First and foremost this is an effective thriller/action film with some interesting characters (John Travolta's dirty cop and Benicio del Toro's assassin among the chief ones), a lot of violence and a playful script, where you never quite know what to expect.But like in Stone's Platoon, where the main character has to choose between the groups surrounding Elias (the idealist camp) and Barnes (the realist camp - Barnes says ""I am war"" at one point), Stone plays out an interesting duality in Savages, between Chon, the war veteran, and Ben, the idealist, who ""goes Bono in Africa"". They can be seen as two sides of the US experience. On one hand, America does good in the world, on the other, it wages wars and does bad. Both on the basis of an industry which makes ""the best weed in the world"" (as Stone himself have proclaimed Californian weed to be). A key scene is the scene in which Travoltas dirty cop compares his own ill doing and double dealing with what goes on in Washington. He says : ""We've become a nation of whores"". O, who is held captive by the cartel, in this way is an American whore (she sleeps with both Ben and Chon, and Del Toros character takes a piece of the action too), who needs both the idealist and the realist in order to be satisfied. As a trio, they're very successful, but ultimately has to do battle with the cartel (which may represent America's enemies small or large) and ultimately be exiled, on the end note that their ""great weed"" may resurface in the future, meaning classic US values (whatever they may be) may return.What the main characters lack in development (agree, they are ""cardboard""), they make up for as metaphors, in my humble opinion quite interesting choice of metaphors. If one buys into this analysis, seeing quality Californian weed as something akin to ""the American soul"" or core US values is quite fun.I enjoyed this movie quite a lot, as a kind of intellectual take on US identity today, as well as a sophisticated thriller/action combo. There are other things open for analysis in a lot of ways, for instance the use of masks and screens, by which large parts of the action are conveyed, and behind which the characters hide, always in some ways masking their true identity and intentions. The female drug lord carrying a wig complements this masking of appearances quite neatly - and humorously. I bet Oliver Stone had a lot of fun adapting this novel for the screen.",Savages
265,twild76,I liked parts of this movie...it's a bad but entertaining movie,6,10 July 2012,"Well this movie was not as good as I thought it was going to be but I'm not all that surprised based on what Oliver Stones been doing as of late. With that being said I still enjoyed parts of this want a be Tarantino like film. I would only suggest seeing this movie if it's free or someone else is paying because it's way to long at 2 hours and 15 minutes. It should have been over in an hour and 40. Contain's spoiler's: The things I liked about this movie: Afghani marijuana Aaron Johnson (His acting was much more convincing then his other two co-partners)Benicio Del Toro (He plays this part all to well)Salma Hayek (Good to see her again and this time as an evil drug dealer)The kidnapping of Elena's daughter and them putting her in a freezerThings I disliked about this movie: Blake Lively (Lets just say her acting is not as good as her looks, it wouldn't be hard to find a more suitable actress for this role, her narrating was way to much like Twilight)Taylor Kitsch (I'm not sure way this guy's acting annoys me so much but it does, it's like they wanted Chris Hemsworth but he was to busy)John Travolta (I felt like his part in this movie as DEA was some how comic relief...so unbelievable and outlandish like when he gets stabbed threw his hand, next scene he just has a bandage on it)The Ending of this movie is awful and it doesn't matter which ending..Stone give's you two to choose from and they both suck. The fist ending has a ridiculous shoot'em up scene, were everyone basically gets shot a bunch of times stupidly in an up close firing range around an SUV. Instead of shooting from a distance..Kitsch with his navy seal training runs from one SUV to another getting shot by snipers. So that both main charters of the movie get shot up close by Del Toro. Then Kitsch decides to fatally inject Johnson and lively and then himself so they can all die together, This would have been a really lame ending. The real ending to the movie is no better with Travolta and the DEA coming in and busting everyone (All most felt like the movie Clue) not before a shoot out with Del Toro killing Hayek. And after all that the two guys do to get her back the movie ends with the three of them not together.....that's what the entire movie was about...them being together again????",Savages

I discovered from this film that Blake Lively is such a terrible actress- she doesn't even know how to cry! her narration is terrible and so is the material she delivered. Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch's performances were equally sleazy. There were explosions and gore but the script, the narration and the plot wasted production and talents such as Benicio del Toro and Salma Hayek.

When the movie starts off, it will have you thinking you should have just stayed at home as everything is out of control. But as the movie progresses, the pieces stick together and turns out to be a sweet drug dealing film. I wasn't wowed by savages, but certainly surprised. I didn't keep my eyes off the screen for one minute. The story made you care and really sunk its claws into you. I also wanted to point out that you might be questioning this film because of it's cast. Don't. Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Johnson are great as the drug dealing duo. Being said this, Savages narrates to disgustingly overly violent scenes that are grossing to one's eyes. A lot of sexual content occurs including a lot of nudity. Salma Hayek does a great job as the villain even though at points her lines get very cheesy, ""I wouldn't have a problem cutting both their throats."" Though the plot seems alarming, it sticks well and turns the movie into a satisfying, gritty drug dealing film. Check out savages when it hits theaters.",Savages
268,sherring8290,This movie one of my least favorites so far from the summer.,4,15 July 2012,"""Savages"" is the story of two marijuana growers, Ben (Aaron Johnson) and Chon (Taylor Kitsch) in Laguna Beach, California and the girl they call ""theirs"", O (Blake Lively). After becoming involved with a Mexican drug cartel, the two men find themselves in a situation involving large amounts of money, but a time span that doesn't suite their waning interest in the drug trade. When they ultimately take too long to decide on how to proceed, their ""love"" O is taken from them by Lado (Benicio Del Toro), one of the head honchos of the cartel. Desperate to find a way to get O back, the two ask for the assistance of DEA agent Dennis (John Travolta) to help them uncover information that will enable them to return O to safety.The leader of the cartel, Elena (Salma Hayek), desperately needs the men to help her fill the demand of drugs that her cartel accrues. Ben and Chon come up with a plan to get O back, and the action ensues. The rest of the movie is slow and at times tedious, so pay attention and try not to fall asleep.The main actors in this film (Johnson, Kitsch and Lively) did a good job, but their performances were shadowed by the outstanding jobs done by the more seasoned actors (Del Toro, Travolta) and actress (Hayek). I felt as if they were children in an adult's world, and it was evident they just aren't as experienced as the older actors and actress. This caused some issues for me, as I was easily bored with Lively's narration and Kitsch's seemingly forced dialog. The majority of the lines spoken by the three main characters were cheesy and overdone, and again it was plainly obvious when compared to the dialog between the more experienced actors.The story was alright, but at times uneventful. Around the half-way point things started to get incredibly convoluted and different story lines began to unravel and lose focus. I would have definitely loved to have seen more of the El Azul character, who made a total of three appearances despite being (supposedly) an important character. There were many scenes in which I felt nothing was happening, and on numerous occasions there were scenes that should have been cut entirely.I loved Del Toro's role; he plays the stone-cold ruthless killer to a tee. It is always a pleasure to see an actor of such caliber deliver an awesome performance, and backed by Travolta's quirky and humorous character, the two made an excellent duo. In one scene the two characters have a funny dialog between each other, which had me laughing hysterically. Never was there a moment when the main characters created that ambiance.I was impressed with the action scenes, although some were overly violent. Don't get me wrong, I love violence in movies: when it serves a purpose. Occasionally there were scenes where it went just slightly too far, and the audience audibly gasped. The same goes for things of a sexual nature. I'm perfectly fine with sex scenes that develop characters or explain key plot points, but gratuitous sexual encounters are for shock films, not box office hits. They could have trimmed some of these and the movie would have come off the same.Overall I enjoyed the story and the characters, however some of the actors did not live up to my expectations and thus brought the movie down with them. Unneeded scenes, a very interesting ending (good or bad, you decide), and poor dialog make this movie one of my least favorites so far from the summer.See more reviews and trailers at http://www.thosetwoguysonline.com",Savages

272,stevenmelodyking,Very Disappointing Storyline,1,14 July 2012,"Originally, I was attracted to this movie since it had a number of well known actors and the only trailer I viewed promised violence: I believed I was walking into an extremely violent action film.The basic story is this: a Green Peace activist type and ex-SEAL make it big in California by growing a line of Marijuana which boasts 33% THC. They become independently wealthy and are the veritable lords of the drug whose popularity spreads worldwide.Since Mexico is contiguous to California, it is not long until a Mexican cartel wants in on the action since the movie offers the promise of exorbitant wealth from this elicit trade.The most shocking aspect of this movie was not the glorification of drugs...it was the role played of the narrator. What joins these two men together was the mutual affection for a single girl: one whom they both share sexually. The movie leaves nothing to imagination---where what anyone would consider slutty behavior is glorified and, in the end, determine to construe a beautiful savagery.The love triangle forms the basis for the female being abducted since these two guys won't cave to the pressure of ""assimilation"" into a new arrangement with the Mexican cartel. Two guys, both having sex with the same female, will do anything to bring her back: including extortion, murder, and abduction.This movie had an interesting plot line which could have been made much differently. John Travolta, Benicio Del Toro, and Selma Hayak all play secondary roles which leads one to believe that the quality of the acting would be top shelf: The interplay between Blake Lively (the sexual glue of the relationship) and Taylor Kitsch/Aaron Johnson will leave you sorely disappointed.",Savages

The film as it is, is nicely produced and shot and for that i would give it 7 out of 10 but the story and the message...eh the message...dumb..haven't seen dumber one in a while. You sit there, watching 130 minutes of non defined story and characters with their badly executed past life. Two American friends building a drug and violence empire with their rich, blonde and 'my mother doesn't love me' girlfriend on one side and evil Mexicans doing the same on the other. Guess how it ends.. without any imagination! And for that this is just another bad Hollywood film. Yeah yeah i know my review is stupid and blah blah but the bottom line is when you do watch it, at the end, you'll feel the same - cheated. So, the final rating is 4/10.",Savages

I wasn't but didn't hate it. Tried to be like True Romance, but lacked the humor and the bizarre action scenes.Benicio Toro - believable and awesome.Acting was pretty good overall, just some tough scenes to pull off because the story didn't seem to pull anyone in...movie tried to be a little too intense and laid back at the same time.",Savages
289,david-4427,"Brutal beyond words, with no point to it.",1,9 July 2012,"Why did Oliver Stone make this movie? It is terribly violent and unnecessarily so; trying to do something new and different, I guess. What effect does this gratuitous violence have on our society? Not a good one, I think. Lots of new slick computer stuff. I recently saw the director and some of the cast talking about this film on Charlie Rose as though it was some wonderful art film. It is not. The sex-triangle is not believable. Travolta is very good. Blake Lively is weak. Taylor Kitsch is weak. Salma Hayek is a cartoon caricature like Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle. It's a shame to see her do this kind of film. My wife told me that he wants to see Marijuana legalized. Perhaps he's showing us all the havoc that Pot causes by being illegal. Looking at his body of work, you can see that he's a skillful, slick filmmaker with a VERY NEGATIVE view of life. MONEY NEVER SLEEPS has a lot of great anti-Wall Street rhetoric, but ultimately leaves us hopeless about combating Wall Street's sins, while glorifying its greed. JFK was very effective, and completely false. (Watch the NOVA documentary about the JFK assassination.) It's a waste of his talent.",Savages
290,mogsoggindog,Cartelsploitation or Brutal Poem? Barf!,2,17 July 2012,"This movie sucks. Its offensive and pathetic the way they portray Mexicans, Naive in the way the Cartel is portrayed. The two main Male American characters are so caricatured that they're hardly characters at all, just automatons, one Peace, one War. Moral of the story: (Spoiler!) Peace is a P***y and War is a D**K. The movie tries to earn Political Correctness points by making the Cartel leader Salma Hayek and giving Blake Lively a gun. Wow! This movie is Challenging me! But, Salma Hayek is wearing green contacts and (Spoiler!) cries like a b***h during the final fight. This movie wants to be this decade's Traffic, but its nothing like Traffic, and vastly inferior. Oliver Stone... hasn't progressed since the 90s, I guess. Typical of directors to peter out when they're middle-aged. He's just Tony Scott at this point, but with his head up his butt more. I thought this movie would have an Anti War-On-Drugs stance, but it doesn't. It has a Die Hard militaristic, fascist perspective on the War On Drugs. It acts like it's super legit, but it feels like a bunch of buffoonery. Travolta made it feel like it could be a sequel to Swordfish. Benecio Del Toro is just a big Orc, or Pig man. It would have been better if he HAD been a literal pig-man. He totally just hams his way through it and its boring. Blake Lively's the only one who actually tries to get an Oscar nomination. Salma Hayek doesn't have a whole lot of Oscar-worthy film acting use (I think Frida was about as good as it gets), but she's cute and she plays the role like she's Elizabeth Taylor in Cleopatra. Good for her. John Travolta seems to know he's been miscast (this character should be like played by William Fitchner or someone like that). John Travolta doesn't have this kind of role left in him, but he tries, which is noble. His dumb soul patch though! Again, Swordfish!So, basically, a bunch of reasonably talented people made an awful, painful-to-sit-through movie out of a retarded, 9th-grade-creative-writing-class, 100% concept story and did it like it was a profound and challenging piece of poetry AND SPELLED OUT EVERY THEMATIC ELEMENT IN Voice-over SEVERAL TIMES SO YOU DON'T MISS OUT ON IMPORTANT SYMBOLS AND METAPHORS.

People aren't sure if the room was meant to be a coy joke of a bad film or just a bad film. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt, savages is a bad film.

293,engineerdaniel,extremely weak effort from a former master,5,3 October 2012,"There is no doubt that I judge this movie more harshly because it is made by a former great film maker. Had this been the first outing of some rookie, which the result feels like, then I would have conceded a higher score. Apart from a shallow and pointless love triangle between the 3 lead characters there is nothing here that we haven't seen before in dozens of other shallow action thrillers. Unfortunately Stone has such a hard on(literally I'm guessing) for the ""love story"" that he gives it way to much screen time. This is the biggest reason why this mess is overly long and despite being about a drug war is slow and boring.There are quite a few other things that the movie does wrong. One simple thing is that all the Mexican characters mix Spanish and English all the time even when talking to each other which I found really annoying. Annoying also sums up the voice over that is used throughout the film which completely took me out of story.The two highlights are Benicio Del Toro who is obviously having a blast as a psychotic hit-man and steals every scene he is in. The other is a short but intense action sequence when the protagonist robs the cartel using a combination of US Army and guerrilla tactics. The movie is not without entertainment value but is just so shallow and lazy in it's storytelling that I can't really recommend it.",Savages

My husband and I went to the film this morning as a 'movie date' and from the opening scenes we hated the film. The bad photography, the loudness of the auto, the blurring of the screen...the lack of plot. We walked out after giving this terrible film one hour. When we turned, we saw two other couples following us out. The sex was unfounded, the dialog was badly written. I was shocked to see such a legend as John Travolta in this degrading role.If this film is what Hollywood is putting out now, I can understand why the theater today had just five couples in it.",Savages

If you're having a bad day and you want to feel worse, go see it.Let's be serious the movie is pretty disturbing and sick to say the least. I am not talking about the love between the 3 main characters, that is not my concern. They love each other and live peacefully, so far it is OK. But to make a point and to try to be such a great work of art this movie desperately tries to shock. The sex scenes start from the beginning of the movie and then you have the sick violent scenes. If you are the psycho type who enjoys watching people die, being tortured, pain, vivid images of people being shot, a whole through someone;s head as the guy gets shot, OK, then you will enjoy the movie. But if you are a normal sane person with no pro violence attitude, boy you're in for a ""great"" time. I felt like throwing up several times. spoiler The scene where they torture one of the cartel guys is horrible. He is being whipped until his eye comes out and they actually show that, this movie really raised my blood pressure and made my heart hurt. But then again, I should have known from the first 10 minutes when you see some heads that were recently chopped off their bodies... A good action movie can be made without being extremely visual and disturbing... Unless the target of the movie is psychopaths and serial killers, in that case they have to show such stuff to make their day... Sarcasm aside, I would def not recommend this movie to anyone and def. don;t take your kids with you... A total waste of time, full of plot holes and pretty bad acting too...

If I had one gripe it would be that it was unrealistic to believe these two guys loved such a characterless woman. However I still thoroughly enjoyed it as a good piece of entertainment. Well-written. Enjoy! I really liked the dialogue and kept rewinding the film so as to not miss anything, it was one of those films I knew it was good as it bothered me if I missed a few words! There are so many rubbish films these days it was refreshing to watch a film that actually kept your attention from the start right through to the very end.

For split second scenes inviting death, why just give a preview of ""what really happens"" in this violent world only to callously censor this very reality. Lousy and lame said JD Salinger. I'll admit, the synopsis for drugs, love and violence for love, was ever so inviting. As well as a young, new attractive cast of heroic bad boys. Oh wait. Mislead. Stereotypicals savages irrevocably reciprocated are nonetheless, simply, boys. Without superpowers, or exceptional human skills, wherefore art thou plot? Save the queen? The End.

The movie gives a gripping story line that keeps you guessing. This movie also puts you into the characters world and you begin to feel a bit of sorrow for the positions that they are in. The director did a great job of keeping the audience interested the movie. I have to say, for a movie that I thought would be just another kill-kill movie, it kept me going the entire movie because i was not only wrong, i was way off.

Very well directed and does not deviate too much from the novel. I was impressed with the acting of Travolta, usually when I see him I can only think about Grease, but this was the first movie where he came off as a very strong actor. Everyone involved in the film was a good actor and I was not disappointed at all. The movie did a good job sticking to a believable story everyone could follow.

A movie that takes you right there so you can feel the seduction and authentic feelings of everything so wrong in the world. Or what they tell us is wrong. The intense scenes that show you animalistic sex and drug use is not for children. There was a child in my theatre. A 7 year old(about) and I thought to myself. What kind of sick person would take their child to a rated R movie. A rated R movie with Wide open sex and threesomes and glorified drug scenes where you might as well get high too, camera damn near in their lungs. I get away from my point. This movie shows you a side of things that you hear about. It mixes love and hate and betrayal also loneliness and parental angst. If there is such a thing. The visual portion of the film lets you feel the Sun and get sun kissed. The Gore is Real. Its there and it forces you to ""man up"" because there is a story here. WATCH and see. It's real.

301,mercedeshenrikson,Oliver Stone lacks realism.,4,6 July 2012,"First off this film had a great cast with exceptional actors. Benecio Del Toro and Salma Hayek were spectacular to watch and played their characters very well. Although this picture brought a great cast it's fair to say that Oliver Stone fell short of delivering a plausible story. The film runs for a long 130 minutes. I felt as if the story dragged on and took forever to get to the point. A 90 minute run time could have been more captivating and easier to watch. I found a good portion of the films scenes to be quite meaningless and didn't take the story anywhere. Don't get me wrong the story has an interesting concept, I do think that it lacked verisimilitude. I just don't see why a powerful drug cartel would be starting a war over something as petty as marijuana. Which brings me to my second puzzling problem about the story... the ending, the ending was just a bunch of nonsense and Stone managed to fit two ridiculous endings into this story. The ending just confirmed the stories lack of realism.",Savages

I'm surprised that Salma Hayek and John Travolta had anything to do with it. You would think that by now they would choose movies that they thought were worth while.

304,erikjaded-417-840635,Truly awful...Oliver Stone what happened to you?,1,7 July 2012,"I went to see 'Savages' today with a friend. The movie was truly a pathetic waste of celluloid and talent. The script seems to have been written with a crayon.Benicio del Toro and Selma Hayek are capable of much better than this dreck. Blake Lively was horribly weak and miscast as a poor little rich girl who is in love with two professional pot growers in California. The two guys live and share her with each other, all like a big happy family. Ridiculous.The only thing even remotely reminiscent of Oliver Stone's finer works is the realistic graphic violence (Platoon, Natural Born Killers). Unfortunately the violence is ham- handed and boring.SPOILER:At the very beginning of the movie the two protagonist pot-growing-buddies receive a video message warning from the South American cartel headed by Selma Hayek's character. The video is so shocking, so disturbingly violent, that how the main characters react to it is completely non-believable. Attached to the video is a place and time the cartel wants to meet the expert growing duo the next day to force them into a contract with the cartel.---Any normal person receiving this video warning would disappear/pack up and flea immediately. But no, instead the guys chill out, smoke pot, and have sex until the next day as if their lives aren't in mortal danger...this is just one of the major weaknesses in the plot.Emile Hirsch is completely underused as a bicycling expert computer hacker who is capable of hacking into the credit card companies and international bank accounts of the cartel; he would have been better cast as one of the two main male characters. John Travolta phones in a lackluster performance as a crooked DEA agent who just happens to have a wife dying from cancer. Whenever he brings her up (we never see her) he is always lighthearted and smiling; he might as well be discussing his golf handicap...The ending seems to have been decided ""by committee."" Seems like the studio couldn't figure out how the movie should end so they give us two endings; the film literally rewinds and shows the second, alternate ending....just pathetically bad. There were audible groans from the audience...The movie is 2 hours 15 minutes; could have been trimmed by a half hour or more...The plot is a train wreck; Oliver Stone said in a recent interview about the film that the book this is based on had 120 different scenes; he trimmed that down to 30. He said he was more inspired by rather than actually trying for a faithful adaption. This is a real tragedy and the movie suffers for it. Mr. Stone basically was too lazy to get it right; this movie could have been a classic like the Pacino/De Niro masterpiece, Heat. This is too bad as the source book material for 'Savages' is highly regarded.Truly a bad, poorly written movie. Stupid and logic-defying.I was excited to see this; I was hoping for a Pulp Fiction/Natural Born Killers vibe (that's what the preview falsely promises).This is Oliver Stone's low point; he can only go up from here. Please don't waste your time, energy, or money on this bloated, overlong, waste of talent, piece of crap. A true raspberry. Insulting to fans that have come to expect realistic and compelling films from Mr. Stone.There are lapses in logic within this film that are worse than cheap 'Friday the 13th' films; things that no rational human being who values their safety/life would ever do. And this is inexcusable as this movie portends to be a serious and realistic tale. 'Lethal Weapon' is more plausible. So is 'The Dark Knight.' 'Savages' plays like a cheap, second-tier comic book of a film. Putrid and sad.On a positive note, my friend and I had a pretty entertaining discussion on the way home from the theater discussing the colossal absurdity of what we had just sat through...I wish I could say 'this movie was so bad it's good.' Unfortunately it's just plain BAD. Very disappointing.",Savages

I was in love with the characters, the music, everything.Benicio Tel Toro and John Travolta were great. Everything was going perfectly. It looked like the movie was going to end. As the character lay dying I honestly thought ""This might be the best movie I've seen in quite some time. I loved nearly every minute of it"" Then something so stupid happened. Something any filmmaker with any respect would go out of their way to avoid. The ""it's a dream scenario"". My heart sank, but I thought, ""ok, maybe the second go around might even better"" even though I thought the first go around was great. No. I literally thought I was watching an episode of the Dukes of Hazzard, with fat cops coming in for the rescue.

As I was leaving the theater I told my friend that I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a films ending before.You get crap endings, with crap films. I honestly can not think of a time where I watched a great film with a terrible ending. It just didn't make a lick of sense. Why did something like this happen? I wish I could get my money back, or get rid of the feeling of disgust out of my throat. When I woke up this morning I still felt angry. I still felt like I was suckered out of my time and money.I felt like I was robbed.This has honestly got to me the biggest disappointment in my film watching life.

However, midway through the movie, I started hoping that this movie will not pan out as I had predicted. (Just like an average narcotic movie with an insipid ending). I'll explain 1. If Oliver Stone was ever going to generate any compassion and affection from the audience about a controversial three-way relationship, He could have at least given us a reason to buy into why two guys (who are cliché polar opposites) will share a girl without any form of power struggle between them. The relationship is painfully unconvincing to carry the central plot of the movie. Sadly, Ophelia (Blake Lively) was as inconsistent as the weather. 2. By revealing that Lado (Benicio del Toro) was the rat, all the suspense and mystery evaporated from the whole movie. There's nothing mind boggling in the entire movie as a matter of fact. 3. I have never seen a multi-million dollar cartel as hospitable, caring and dumb as this one. We always knew the good guys would win. 4. Mr. Stone... Both endings were a slap in the face since you killed all interest before the final scene. 5. With Ophelia narrating, an 8 year old kid could deduce that she survives at the end despite weak and silly attempts to makes us believe she ""could be dead"". Finally, the visuals, screenplay and effects try to fool you into believing that you're watching an epic ""Avengers-like"" blockbuster.. But really you're watching just another action cartel movie. A grotesque one.",Savages

All fine (more or less) villains. This film didn't take advantage of the ironic comedic skills of these actors, unfortunately. The other acting I thought was good, except Lively seemed weak in an important role. That may have been partly poor writing and direction -- she came across as neither innocent nor sophisticated, more like a dumb stoner that had lucked into an odd relationship and fallen into a horrifying situation. The weakness told, however, because she did the narration. A lot of narration.And the narration was what really pulled this movie down for me. This ain't an audio book, it's a movie. Show us, don't tell us. The story isn't complicated enough to need narration. It's often stupid narration, too -- ""make me a whole woman"", ""buddhist"" vs ""baddist"". If you insist on narration (why?), a more sardonic (and sparing) narration by Travolta would have been a lot more fun, especially explaining the ending. But no, it's sledgehammer, not stiletto...I thought some of the camera work -- especially the more violent scenes -- was great.

If you want to make a movie about drugs, show the classic kid buying and selling pot for parties claiming he/she's ""discovering new realms of reality,"" always convincing others ""it's OK, it's local,"" while innumerable people are getting decapitated in Mexico.

Mister 'Nothing Personal' is the nice and friendly son of Nancy Bodwin in Weeds and mister 'kaviar' is the crazy violent son of Nancy. Salma Hayek is Nancy and Benicio can be compared with Garcia Gomez. Almost every scene is copy/pasted from different episodes of Weeds.

I felt like this movie was excruciatingly boring, the only original idea in the movie was the peculiar three-person couple they had. The whole idea of the movie being based around drugs was an easy escape for the producer, and the viewers were the one's who had to bear the bitter fruit. Yes I gave this movie a 2/10 because I cannot fully express how awful I felt watching it. This movie could bore anybody, I would rather have watched paint dry on my wall.

I 'we watched this with six of my friends and we all came to a conclusion that we wished that the movie lasted 262 minutes instead of 131.Exelent job as the movie keeps you on the edge for the hole time and the end is satisfying in a way you never hoped to imagine.

315,marin-nestorov,The best movie in past several years,10,8 November 2012,"Not easy to find such a brilliantly directed film, with an original approach to the subject of cliché. It is simply hard to believe that the Hijacking may have something that goes beyond the deja-vu effect. The story brings a lot of profound dialogs between good and bad characters, as an equally balanced lucidity between followers of Budha and Lucifer. As expected, Benicio del Toro is shining as negative, Salm Hayek and John Travolta are average good. But Oliver Stone decided to put three less developed actors in main roles, and this made the movie magnificent! They blended into characters abslolutely perfect, giving the film modern and feel of freshness, and three starrs gave it strength and seriousness. Playing easy with emotions of a viewer is constant, from early beginning to very end, actually both ends, as movie has two. Blake Lively successfully plays a role of coldest heart melter, and Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor- Johnson finally played really deep roles. Fabulous story of love and determination.

317,sailing-butler,WOW..Oliver Stone's version of Gossip Girl!,2,17 November 2012,This movie was amazingly terrible and naive...I wouldn't expect anything else from Oliver Stone trying to capture this subject. The writing was awful and stereotypical...way to think out side the box! I would really think twice about watching this movie unless you can get it on Netflix. I think I would probably watch two mythical Sasquatches have a love triangle with a unicorn instead. It would be probably be more probable then one aggressive war vet and an underachieving Berkeley grad sharing their love for the same girl amicably. Cheers.

I found myself getting attached and feeling for the characters and at some points, I was even in tears. It upsets me to see that so many users only gave Savages a one star rating and a bad review.

The story evolves around this tramp who is sleeping with two different guys. It is pretty ridiculous how bad this movie really is.

320,Jameypotts41,Worst movie I've ever seen in my life,1,1 January 2013,"Is this movie meant to be taken seriously? Because I laughed through the entire thing. Blake Lively as O makes for a certain shoe in for the worst actress of the year at the razzie awards. Very nice Shakespeare reference. Not. The end beach sequence with her looking into the camera as the sun sets in the background was proof of how she is better suited for Calvin Klein cologne commercials, not major motion pictures,certainly not an Oliver Stone drug cartel ""drama"". Seriously, her and Taylor Kitsch should have just made a porno and called it a day. Kitsch's flaring nostrils and egregious dialogue in this film make me wonder how he will ever get work again. Oh wait, he was hired after John Carter. Never mind. Worst.Actor.Ever. Not one shred of personality on screen. His interaction with Aaron Johnson throughout the film as they shared joints and talked about their love for O was so contrived...I hate watching actors who I can tell are acting. I wasn't able to get lost in this film, I was aware of the acting and lackluster writing the entire 2 hours plus. The only ""believable"" part was when Ben and Chan were riding dirty with 300 lbs of weed in the van and the cop behind them flicked his lights on but ultimately went speeding past. That sense of relief is something to which I can relate. Otherwise....  Two weed entrepreneurs sharing a blonde bimbo who brings nothing to the table expect for her willingness to spread her legs..?!??Unbelievable that she was so special and irreplaceable. The trio lived in Laguna Beach, there's like a million ""O""'s there.  If the love triangle was so ""special"", perhaps the viewer should have been informed why. Otherwise the movie looks like a stoned guy with  PTSD and his  Buddhist lover  trying to ensure that their source of vagina wouldn't be compromised to a Mexican drug cartel. Chan couldn't ""last three weeks""...O could only last ""like 7 to 10 days."" WTF? My favorite part: When O asked her kidnapper for weed via Skype  ""I mean the stuff we're all killing each other for"". Hahahaha. I laughed so hard at the ending. I didn't realize this film was supposed to be a stoner comedy?  Benecio del Toro, Emelie Hirsch and Selma Hayek are lucky that their career isn't over after agreeing to be in this POS.",Savages
321,real_phable,Critics were let down and you will be too,6,23 October 2012,"But you have to give it to the critics, they must've felt like I did before this film; I really wanna like this movie. And then the narration kicks in and after the first minute, you know you're gonna be so disappointed and maybe even hate this film. There hasn't been a single tolerable female narration since Kill Bill, and before that, well, maybe T2 was reasonable. Narration hardly ever belongs, apart from a Scorsese picture.Let alone the two male leads. Rarely has so much being carried so boldly and badly with so little charisma. This two guys should never share a screen on a this scale movie, I'd maybe give them a scene in a WW2- feature series next time and still be disappointed. And then the Blake Lively-vivid character ""O"". O'boy, someone should really wargasm her all over. The character doesn't seem to belong anywhere in this movie, although she plays a significant part in the plot. But I can't help myself thinking that without this character, this movie could've been so much better.Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro give out the best performances of the movie by far, but that ain't gonna come as a surprise to anyone. Del Toro gets actually very scary and creepy in some scenes, and Hayek makes the best out of a pretty vague female drug cartel-queen -character. And is smoking hot as always.Im not saying that the three leads, Blake Lively, Aaron Taylor-Johnson or Taylor Kitsch can't act. They're just sooo miscast on this one, their mutual lack of chemistry on-screen is just unbearable, and they make you wanna wish that Del Toro's Lado will whip their eyeballs out on the end.

The Don Winslow book was a page turner that was filled with suspense, gangster violence, sexy scenes, and was so stylized. The 'coolness' of this story dripped off the pages. My expectations for the movie initially were low, but when I heard that Oliver Stone was at the helm I got really excited. I mean how could it go wrong? A story this good with a film maker who brought us The Doors, Platoon, and Any Given Sunday can't go wrong. Well it did, in a big way. Acting was terrible, the voice over narration was annoying, and the editing was wonky leaving the film with no pace. And where was the Oliver Stone touches we thought would be there?!?

323,sunzoo53,An Underrated Overachiever,10,28 July 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought it was completely ridiculous. I was put on to it by a friend at a completely random and unexpected time. I was in no mood for movie watching, but the opening dialogue did however catch my attention. So I watched, and was amazed and befuddled by the experience. I became addicted to this film. I must've watched it a dozen times in the next month. I have been a fan of cinema since my days of being a young teen and using movie watching to get girls in my bedroom after school. I can definitely understand why so many are let down by the film. I walk this life knowing that the majority of this world are looking to be hand fed entertainment and reluctant to understand anything that is different than the norm. This movie is exactly the opposite. There is an amazing parallel that is drawn in this film between the the top of the top and the lowest of the low, sometimes these lines are shown to us at the same time and I feel this is very much overlooked by many of these reviews. I look at this film as a classic in crime drama/thriller, up there with the likes of Goodfellas, Scarface, The Departed, etc. It is different. That is what I enjoyed about it. If you fall victim to getting hung up on the little things you will miss the perspective that is the gift of this film.",Savages

325,jvmthree,Classic tale,2,21 August 2013,"This film offers a brand new perspective on an age-old archetype: An evil, aggressively ruthless drug cartel is so envious of the quality of their competitor's marijuana that they are forced to kidnap the hot blonde that is sleeping with said competitors! Yes, two rich and handsome pot dealers share one beautiful woman, but their personalities are so perfectly opposite that it is supposed to make sense. I guess.The acting here is all pretty generic, so I will just give a spoiler free rundown of the plot: This particular cartel commits vicious crimes like mass be-headings and point-blank executions in order to secure their market and their political protections. But two guys in California grow better pot than they do, so they need to kidnap Blake Lively to ensure that these two surfer bros teach them all that they know about horticulture. Because one of them is a botanist (hint: not Taylor Kitsch) and a ruthless cartel would never be able to find any other world-class botanists. If they did, this film would run maybe 5 minutes of the cartel carrying the bodies and the plants away. A weak effort on what might have been a good gangster film.",Savages

If not for a 'name' director, this would be consigned to straight to video land. It's based on a book by an absolutely atrocious author, Winslow, who writes pure unreadable dreck. So come to think of it, the movie is quite true to the book. Nonexistent plot, acting and unwatchable voice over narration. I'm embarrassed for myself that I took it out of the library, and for anyone associated with making it. And I like Benicio del Toro. Save your brain, give this a wide berth.

Del torro was the only one who knew what he was doing. Travolta was not bad either even though I could not stop staring at his hair and this was quite distracting. As a story it was quite interesting but it didn't explain why was keeping these three people together and why in earth their relationship was so strong. The two endings gave me the feeling that stone didn't know what to do with the movie in the end. Maybe when he saw how terrible the three leading actors played... I really can t tell what happened with the casting. It s sad for someone like stone to end up giving instructions to lively.

329,fishyonekenobi,Believable and scary plot,8,13 April 2014,I am a scientist-objective thinker and I have to say this movie paid attention to detail and scared the hell out of me. The viewer often puts themselves in the movie; it's part of cinematic technique to involve the viewer at a subconscious level. I'm not an expert on acting but from a regular guy viewpoint the actors all did a very convincing job. The special effects were very realistic. It's also a nod to our brave special forces soldiers; don't mess with a Navy Seal. Way too violent for a young crowd but a suspenseful movie for mature action audience. Given outrageous news reports about cartels this movie plot seemed totally plausible.,Savages
330,lucasgd10,Analysis,9,29 April 2014,"Savages' opening credit sequence begins with the Universal Pictures intro and its fanfare music followed by a video of the Mexican cartel integrating and killing hostages. There is no music during the integrating scene, only the sound of chains and a chainsaw. This is the first 30 seconds of the movie, and then the music becomes softer and has like Hawaiian feel to it as they introduce Ophelia. The movie makes O look innocent and sincere as she walks on the beach narrating her story. While she strolls on the beach the audience hears the sound of waves crashing, and soft ocean music in the background as well as being in black and white with black lettering on the white screen. Right when Ophelia starts actually talking about her story, the music changes and color appears on the screen with gold font. Ophelia talks for 5 minutes setting up the movie until the actual title of the movie appears after smoking and having sex with Chon. (O. Stone, 2012) During the closing credit sequence of the color switches off and on with Chon, Ben, and Ophelia walking on the beach with again the waves crashing onto shore and the same Hawaiian music playing in the background. Ophelia continues to narrate about where they could possibly be not hinting exactly where the three lovers are. Then she talks about the definition of savages saying it means ""cruel, crippled, or regressed back to a primal state of being."" Then as she walks on the beach she said that they would live like savages, the movie goes black with ""THE END"" in white popping onto the screen. While the movie ends and Here Comes the Sun written by George Harrison starts to play. (O. Stone, 2012)The music in Savages was mostly suspenseful but more of a modern kind of suspense. One example of this kind of modernized suspense is when Lado (Benicio del Toro), Elena's consultant, and along with his crew invade a lawyer's house after the lawyer was unable to negotiate to have one of Elena's men sent free in 5 years with possession of coke. Instead the Elena's man was found guilty and was actually sentenced for 20 years, so Lado does the ""judicial"" thing and kills the lawyer as well as his girlfriend. Since we are dealing with the Mexican cartel, Adam Peters made this scene sound thrilling but have a little Mexican flavor with the use of Spanish singers in the background, drums, and trumpets. (O. Stone, 2012) Adam Peters has also incorporates different leitmotivs for Ophelia, the Mexican cartel, and Chon's computer ringtone in order to show Peters' impression about Savages. Ophelia's leitmotiv is calm and relaxing, the guitar is what helps give the music a soft and warm feeling to the scene. Her music most of the time is being played either when Ben and/or Chon is thinking of her next to the ocean or when she is walking on the beach with her hair blowing in the wind. Being next to the beach also important because it gives Ophelia's music the background sound of the waves hitting the shore. The Mexican cartel's leitmotiv is essentially the exact opposite feel from Ophelia's. It is more dark and dramatic with different situations when the tempo changes, the music become cold and mysterious. For example, while Lado spends most of the day following and studying the three lovers, he is on the phone with Elena telling to her about the two friends' girlfriend. While Elena hints to Lado that in order for the two California entrepreneurs to join the cartel, Lado needs to kidnap Ophelia and the music in the movie is soft and mysterious because of the actual setting of the scene. Elena is in her nightgown lying in bed while Lado is in front of the Ben and Chon's house smoking a cigarette; it's a cool night that gives the music a creepy but effective vibe. Another example of the tempo change with the cartel's leitmotiv is when Ben and Chon realize that Elena kidnapped Ophelia. The tempo speeds up while the duo rush to gather up and drive for miles with 300 pounds of marijuana in their white SUV and continues to speed while Ben realizes that a cop car starts to follow them. The setting of both situations had the same music, but played in different tempos and can be either dragged out making the melody longer or increased to make is short but dramatic. The third leitmotiv was Chon's computer ringtone whenever he got an Email this sound only appeared 3 or 4 times during the beginning of the movie, but the music is digital with a clown soft of feel to it. In Savages, every time the audience heard this music coming from Chon's Computer they knew the cartel were trying to contact them. While talking to the Elena about the abduction of Ophelia, the cartel made a digital simulation of them chopping off Ophelia's head and blood spraying all over the screen, and as this occurs the Chon's ringtone is being played again but actually in there face. This kind of music is called Source music, because the audience can actually see where the source of the music is coming from. (O. Stone, 2012)",Savages

Things fall in place in a movie so easily when the director didn't think much. A very crappy direction/story line. Three. The rape victim kills the rapist.

334,hannah-f-b,"I was totally gripped, until the end",6,27 September 2012,"This is my first review for IMDb. I felt after seeing this film it was necessary. (spoilers below!)After seeing the trailer for this movie I was expecting a thrilling (even if somewhat far-fetched) action story, which is what I got - mostly. The movie is incredibly well made, some beautiful editing and cinematography, and the styling is impeccable. I was thoroughly enjoying some of the performances in the movie too, particularly Salma Hayek and Benicio Del Toro playing excellent villains. I even enjoyed John Travolta's role as the kind of anti-hero cop, looking after number one. But, and as I've read from many reviews on here, I had no strong empathy with O, Blake Lively's character. I felt she was a little underdeveloped as a character and I couldn't grasp what made her so special in order for the two protagonists to be willing to share her, or fight so hard to get her back. Taylor Kitsch was good enough to be entertaining, his character was a little better than O but not by much. On the other hand, Aaron Johnson was the only one of the three main characters I genuinely felt I cared about whilst watching the movie. He is clearly the most talented of the three, no disrespect to the others of course, but I definitely felt his role was the strongest.But the acting on the whole was acceptable, and that isn't my problem with this movie. I'm sure there are several people reading that will agree, that the problem with this movie is the ending. In my opinion (and apparently a lot of other people's opinion) this movie should have ended ten minutes earlier than it did. While I was watching this movie in the cinema, just after O's 'imagined ending' where the camera pans out to see the three protagonists lying next to the jeep, two customers sitting near me got up and left the screen. I guess they assumed it was the end. And my my, I wish I had done the same. At first I wondered where these customers were going, ""you're missing the end"", I thought. These customers were apparently very clever, because I felt that point would have been a perfect ending to this film, suitably shocking and sad. The three are are all together just like they wanted, but in a tragic way. Having everything wrapped up in a happy neat little package, with the bad guy (or girl in this case) in prison and everyone else conveniently living perfect lives just didn't make any sense to me. Especially Dennis' glorious end, honestly. I felt genuine disappointment at this point, as I had been enjoying the film so much. Despite this, I still really want you to see this movie. Don't be put off. It is after all a really enjoyable movie, with some great acting from unexpected characters and fantastic direction. Just leave the cinema ten minutes before the end.",Savages
